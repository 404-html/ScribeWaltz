1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.740
The joe rogan experience coder and a,
they wouldn't have done it.

2
00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:07.560
I would not have come back.
I've never been,
Hendricks was on something.

3
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.880
Does that question.
I don't have the evidence and we'll never have it.

4
00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:16.200
Like you don't have the oven incident.

5
00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:19.930
We talked about fighters like that got cut.

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.770
You don't have the evidence they were there before it got cut.

7
00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:24.300
Like I don't have the evidence.

8
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.910
The only thing I can say is I didn't want to attack one particular individual

9
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.650
and I wanted to change the system because if you have one individual,

10
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.640
another one would come.

11
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.560
So in that particular case it was Hendrickson and I want it to change it.

12
00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:43.470
And in the beginning he agreed with me to do it,

13
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.470
but then he changed his mind and that's when I got very angry.

14
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.660
Agreed with you to take we,
I agreed.
I agree that it was public.
He agreed.

15
00:00:51.661 --> 00:00:53.700
When we say you can look,

16
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.840
you have the evidence that in the interview he said he agreed to do a test,

17
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.980
but then he said,
uh,
no.
I did not agree.

18
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.990
Because also the UFC told him to not agri that UFC told him the UFC told him is

19
00:01:07.341 --> 00:01:12.270
the truth.
They told him to not do it because I they weren't,
they didn't want,

20
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.150
they had a problem maybe with the um,
at the Vad Vat,

21
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.010
the VAT Aveda world anti-doping

22
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.330
wider that make the guideline but there are [inaudible] that's bad that I took.

23
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.340
They had a problem with them.
I don't know why it wasn't to Conti.

24
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.180
Did he know he was Marimekko rep the go read something or it was a lady but they

25
00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:38.130
had a problem so they said to not do with the desk,
Ma not do it,

26
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.791
period.

27
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:41.820
I don't know if it was because I think it was because of [inaudible] because I

28
00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:44.910
made that little investigation on that and I got very angry.

29
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.990
That's why like psychologically I said to myself as I shouldn't,

30
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.000
I should not have,
if I would have go back in time,
I would have,

31
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.090
I would not have pegged that,
that fight and when not to think that's fine.

32
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.760
That's why I respect a lot of fight or they stand up for themselves.

33
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.660
I didn't have the courage that I,
I didn't do it when it was time to do it.

34
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.740
And I showed that I regret it about this one thing.
I regretted my career,

35
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.420
I should have done it.
I said,
you don't want to sign,
okay,
take your belt.

36
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.180
I'm going,
yeah,
I should have done that before.

37
00:02:09.181 --> 00:02:11.630
Maybe I would have come back earlier.
Hmm.

38
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.280
So I would miss a paycheck,
but who you know had enough,

39
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.930
I would have enough.
You know what I mean?

40
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.810
So you don't want to say whether or not you suspect that Johnny Hendricks was

41
00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:26.670
doing something,
but there was people that were definitely doing something.
Yes.

42
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.440
I don't have the evidence.
Maybe he did.
Maybe I don't want to accuse.

43
00:02:31.441 --> 00:02:34.620
And I a lot of guide,
they do it and I don't,

44
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.790
I don't want to judge them because I love that they have a family to feed and

45
00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:39.624
everything.

46
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.690
And this could make the difference between winning $1 million or not winning and

47
00:02:46.701 --> 00:02:48.780
like,
Eh,
at all.
You know what I mean?

48
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.440
So everybody has a different reason.
Why are they the,

49
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.390
they do it and I,

50
00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:59.391
and it's just a system and courageous to do with that has that problem.

51
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.110
Yeah.
And especially if there's no testing or the testing is very pools,

52
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.250
like the testing when you first started your career,

53
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.270
I mean basically just had to pee after the weigh in and you were okay.

54
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.450
You have to be,
even now,
it's still easy to,
to even now it's,

55
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.210
yeah man,
it is like how would someone rig the 60 now?
Okay,
let's say you have a,

56
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.860
we're about at my phone.
Okay.
No,
I'm saying it then everybody knows that.

57
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.930
Especially that she thought,
I didn't know that look after I thought it true.

58
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.600
It's not 100% sure,

59
00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:33.601
but let's say I want to have an injection of a product that will last and my

60
00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:37.030
buddy for two days or one day.

61
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.770
So I know that particular day I cannot be tested because if I am,
I'm screwed.

62
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.610
So I put the,
I put my tea,
my worry about that.

63
00:03:45.611 --> 00:03:48.610
I'm traveling to the Freakin Antarctica,

64
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.560
Antarctica or anywhere like somewhere that is crazy.

65
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.170
Leave a bowl and then I come back and do two days after.

66
00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.480
But that's obsessed with thin my buddy for a certain period of time,
but it will,

67
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.660
they effect of it will last maybe a month.

68
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.020
And now we talk about performance enhancing drugs.
Joe,

69
00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:09.550
people don't miss on this is there,
well yeah,

70
00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:12.400
but it still doesn't make different.
Yes,
it does make the difference.

71
00:04:12.401 --> 00:04:17.401
And then athlete and the reason is in the 80s and before it was giving you more

72
00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:22.090
power and more stem in a more enjoyments.
Now a man would,
that technology,

73
00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:25.600
they have stuff that will change your reaction time,
your confidence,

74
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.990
your reset time and not,
this is a huge,

75
00:04:28.991 --> 00:04:33.530
huge application man.
If you're,
if you're play baseball or union fighting,

76
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.160
you see the things coming.
You have your reaction time,

77
00:04:36.161 --> 00:04:39.790
your sharper in dead brain.
What makes that Guy Athletic?

78
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.840
It's not as muscle.
The reason why you were saying both is you run faster.

79
00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:47.200
There's many reasons why,
but one of the main reason is because his brain,

80
00:04:47.201 --> 00:04:49.510
his nervous system is better.

81
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.010
And if you make your nervous system better and more competent,

82
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.800
a better,
you're a better athlete,
man,

83
00:04:56.801 --> 00:05:00.250
you'd better fighter a better baseball player.
You better you better person,

84
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.530
better person in a way.
Of course that effect is limited,

85
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.890
but there's still the the muscle memory thing that will last,

86
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.570
you know,
and you could laugh forever.

87
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.660
So now with that technology man at one point the sport,

88
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.520
that's why I'm afraid I'm afraid to sport becomes so messed up that with the

89
00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:22.810
gene doping and all that,

90
00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:26.860
I want to point it would be off sport would be completely,

91
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.390
completely messed up in the future.
I talk not now,
but sport will be,

92
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.560
it won't be any normal people competing will be only like kind of a seaboard.

93
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.480
People,
cyborgs,
everybody.

94
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.590
People are really worried about gene doping and the mentor already starting to

95
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:44.440
do that.
But on the gene,
even the mother,
the mother and stuff,

96
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:48.040
performance enhancing drug de Doo man,
it's very hard to catch up people.
So,

97
00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:51.400
like I said,
it's easy to take something.
I mean,

98
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.240
there's always that chance that you get cut,
but that's how I,
if I would do it,

99
00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:57.380
that's how I would do.
I would break down,

100
00:05:57.381 --> 00:06:02.000
I'm going to now Antartica get an injection,
then I come back and I'm,
I'm good.

101
00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.670
No.
Wicki told me that there are starting,
will they,

102
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.870
they have it and they don't know whether or not people are taking it,

103
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.850
but they're taking testosterone's is derived from animals,
not from wild yams,

104
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.960
like the way they get testosterone.
Now if you get like a testosterone injection,

105
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.520
they're getting it from a wild yams and some yams.
Yeah.

106
00:06:22.521 --> 00:06:24.390
The fruit of the,
the,
you know,
the vegetable,

107
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.210
the tuber in Jamaica is they,
yeah.
Yeah.

108
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:32.420
That's how they're getting testosterone.
They're getting it from that

109
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.980
plant based,
um,
wild Yam testosterone.
But now,
uh,

110
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.200
they're able to get it from animals and the animal testosterone,
you,

111
00:06:44.201 --> 00:06:48.830
you don't like,
they do carbon isotope tests and the carbon isotope,

112
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:53.831
Taz don't detect the difference between a animal testosterone in human

113
00:06:53.841 --> 00:06:56.090
testosterone,
but there's a current tests.

114
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.510
One of the things that they do is they freeze your piss and they freeze your

115
00:06:59.511 --> 00:07:03.770
blood for they're doing it for years and this is how they've caught some of

116
00:07:03.771 --> 00:07:08.120
these Russian wrestlers and they've taken away gold metals from guys at one in

117
00:07:08.121 --> 00:07:10.390
the early two thousands for a,

118
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.690
they found new tests and with the new test they'd be able to determine that they

119
00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:19.280
were taking stereotypies that same thing when Ben Johnson beat Carl Lewis.
Yes.

120
00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:23.660
Yeah,
yeah.
And Ben Johnson this,
well,
he was on some shit,
but guess what?

121
00:07:23.661 --> 00:07:25.750
Carl was not some shit.
Yeah.

122
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.120
Then I think nine out of the 10 or eight out of that,

123
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.470
like the guy that that finished like eight,
like it was a Brazilian guy.

124
00:07:33.471 --> 00:07:35.740
He would eat it.
Any enter you got interviews at?
Yeah.

125
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.510
It was just a fillers for the main guy.

126
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:43.880
He would have won that gold medal.
Right.
Because man,
that shit changed your life,

127
00:07:43.881 --> 00:07:47.330
man.
That changed your life,
man.
Make you a better living.

128
00:07:47.331 --> 00:07:51.960
Millionaire may be sponsorship that just so bad,
you know?
See?

129
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.440
Yeah man,
this is crazy.
How about Lance Armstrong?

130
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.230
I mean when you go the Tour de France,

131
00:07:57.231 --> 00:07:59.960
when he won and then they took his title away,

132
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.750
all the people that were below him,
we're also guilty.

133
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.740
So you'd take his title away.
What about the number two?
He's fucking guilty too.

134
00:08:06.741 --> 00:08:09.830
Number three,
they said that on one of the years that he won,

135
00:08:09.831 --> 00:08:13.910
you had to go back to 18th place to find a guy who's never caught taking

136
00:08:13.911 --> 00:08:17.510
anything.
That's a dirty sport.
But man,

137
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:21.440
you asked me if I think he was taking,
I don't know.

138
00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:25.610
I haven't asked.
Suspicions have suspicion,
but it's not right.

139
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.660
If you know what that would,
the evidence to Iq someone.
Yes,
I agree.

140
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:32.870
And even today it's,
if I think there was some guys,

141
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:37.250
if there is a lot of guy that takes the red and performance enhancing drug,
yes,

142
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.630
yes.
And I have an idea of who,

143
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.870
and I'm pretty like just for my gut feeling,

144
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:48.080
99.9% sure.
But I don't want to have the evidence.

145
00:08:48.081 --> 00:08:52.480
It's not what you think.
Some way,
you know,
is where you can prove.
And I,

146
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.890
I don't know.
Yeah.
Talking to,
you know,
I'm in the game,

147
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:59.280
I'm talking to a lot of people in between fighters.
We know who does,
who.

148
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.880
There's only a few and full of people who does the old,

149
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:08.520
the whole team.
You know,
one guy could do these steam,
the steam,

150
00:09:08.521 --> 00:09:11.010
the steam and one other guy can do two team.

151
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.330
The word guy that goes around them,
especially when you're,

152
00:09:14.331 --> 00:09:18.540
you're top elite fighters world goes I,
the word goes around,
you know,
like,

153
00:09:18.541 --> 00:09:23.130
like the people,
they,
they talk to me and they say if I,
if I would be interested,

154
00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:25.920
I'd been off different offered before in different things,
you know,

155
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.060
what have you been offered before?

156
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:31.890
I've been offered men too sometime too to go train and then like some deals,

157
00:09:31.891 --> 00:09:36.390
you know,
like good go train and do,
do,
do something.
Being being part of a,

158
00:09:36.391 --> 00:09:39.030
you know,
like they have a,
they take sample of your blood.

159
00:09:39.031 --> 00:09:42.540
They know what is missing.
Then they put the stuff that is missing.
Make Cube.

160
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.250
As I know,
as I write,
I stay in Montreal.
You know,
like I like I,

161
00:09:46.251 --> 00:09:50.420
and I don't say much Montrell could I,
it could be a lot of cheater too,
right?

162
00:09:50.421 --> 00:09:53.730
Like I,
that's the thing.
You accuse a gym of cheating.

163
00:09:53.731 --> 00:09:57.060
You can actually use a gym of cheating because everybody is different.
You know,

164
00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.720
there's people cheating everywhere now you can't say,
oh this,

165
00:10:00.721 --> 00:10:04.020
these people are shit now man,
they,
it doesn't work like that.
It works.

166
00:10:04.021 --> 00:10:08.460
Every individual,
you know,
if you made the choice,
if you decide to go that path,

167
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.890
you have to be ready to face the consequences.

168
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:15.240
If you don't face a consequence Zirena or your competition years and maybe

169
00:10:15.241 --> 00:10:19.890
you'll face later after you're gone and you retire for your career.
As I,

170
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.040
a lot of a lot of people I know is creating a lot.
Some of my friend,

171
00:10:23.041 --> 00:10:27.540
they were bodybuilders now the seed,
see their buddy are mess up,
man.

172
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:32.670
There are are all messed up date.
They,
they,
they got bad problem.

173
00:10:32.671 --> 00:10:35.250
I don't want to be like that,
you know,
I don't want to be like that.

174
00:10:35.251 --> 00:10:38.070
I want to be happy.
You know,
I want to be healthy.
Yeah.

175
00:10:38.071 --> 00:10:41.580
They tear the joint apart too.
That's a,
like I had,
um,

176
00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:45.030
Dorian Yates on the podcast.
He can't even do pushups now.

177
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.800
And Dorian Yates was Mister Olympia.
It was a fucking giant guy.
But all that,

178
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.520
everything just ripped apart.
It's like everything's all fucked up.

179
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:57.600
It just doesn't work right anymore.
However,
if you ask these people,

180
00:10:57.601 --> 00:11:00.510
would you do it again?
Maybe they say,
yeah,
maybe it was worst.

181
00:11:00.511 --> 00:11:05.070
It maybe it was worth it.
Maybe it wasn't.
I think it depends on every individual,

182
00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.180
you know what I mean?
But for me,
I'm happy with what I have so far.

183
00:11:09.181 --> 00:11:13.140
I know I could get more,
maybe the future,
but I don't want to do,

184
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:16.500
to go that path to try to risk everything or what do you want to think when

185
00:11:16.501 --> 00:11:20.340
testosterone replacement therapy was a thing and they were allowing people like

186
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:24.420
[inaudible] and these people who take testosterone as so freaking angry about

187
00:11:24.421 --> 00:11:28.670
this.
Yeah.
I think it was like,
you know,
I,

188
00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:32.280
everybody,
it's a different case for everybody,
but I believe if you,

189
00:11:32.281 --> 00:11:37.281
if you need to take the medication to compete performance and medication to

190
00:11:38.851 --> 00:11:43.680
compete,
you shouldn't be allowed.
And,
and,
and Joe,
I'm not against the thyroid.

191
00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:46.940
I'm going to explain it to like,
people say,
oh,
he's,
I guess I'm not against Purr,

192
00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:51.030
like stay steroid,
eh,
or Tessa.
I'm not against it.

193
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.400
If it's for their wellbeing,

194
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:58.210
if it's an older man who we cannot have sex with his wife and he is like,

195
00:11:58.211 --> 00:12:01.900
man that you go see the doctor.
I said,
man,
I,
I lose the edge at it a bit.

196
00:12:01.901 --> 00:12:05.250
Can we do doctor was a,
yeah,
I put the cream that that will increase her.

197
00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.530
So you and the guy,
he's happier.
You have sex with his wife.
Competition,
yes.

198
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.250
In terms of competition,
if me and you were fighting and I,

199
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:17.280
we sign that we're not using any weapon and I'm talking about biological weapon

200
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:22.980
and we'll fight men to men as a real martial artists by a to of a code of honor.

201
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:24.940
And you will be.
I know for me,

202
00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:29.680
I go and inject myself something to make me stronger or more competent.

203
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:34.120
My could also help my neurone tougher to fire,

204
00:12:34.121 --> 00:12:38.020
better to get something to be more,
to be better,

205
00:12:38.021 --> 00:12:41.410
to enhance my performance.
Now,
now I'm against that.

206
00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:45.160
This is a code of honor and the,
if you don't respect that code man,

207
00:12:45.161 --> 00:12:47.110
he should be out of martial arts.

208
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.400
What are people taking that makes the reaction time better?
It makes her mind,

209
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.790
I don't know that the name,
but there there is many.
If you talk to us a guide,

210
00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:56.710
there's a lot of things,
a lot of things.
I know if baseball player,

211
00:12:56.711 --> 00:12:58.900
they take stuff for the reaction time,

212
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:04.200
like the picture because in baseball and tennis and even in fighting before your

213
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:07.330
up punch there is like an indication here,
but the buddy language,

214
00:13:07.331 --> 00:13:10.240
he reads something like before you throw a ball there's a movement for you

215
00:13:10.241 --> 00:13:13.900
punched her as well,
so you see better you your brain.

216
00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:18.010
There's even a medication you can take for exam.
You study in school,

217
00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.230
there's an exam,
you have an exam tomorrow you're going to study or your,

218
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.090
your desktop that you need to know.
Then at night you will increase you.

219
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.240
Then you go pass the exam.
I know it sound crazy to go.
Go,
go get it.

220
00:13:28.241 --> 00:13:32.620
And it's crazy man.
Well I know Adderall,
Adderall,
swans,
it may I say is man,

221
00:13:32.621 --> 00:13:36.270
you make your bed better in the brain.
If you make your brain better,

222
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.190
your nervous system better man.
You bet you you're a better fighter.

223
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.890
It's not only physic,
physical,
uh,

224
00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:48.220
enhancement.
It wasn't the 80s.
Now when the 2000 year now,

225
00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:49.750
now it's neurologic man.

226
00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:54.670
That's when it's crazy dangerous and so new it will be like it would the gene

227
00:13:54.671 --> 00:13:58.090
doping,
forget it man.
The athlete will be born athlete.
You want me,

228
00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:02.260
I got like me or anybody that fight in UFC won't be able to compete and you have

229
00:14:02.261 --> 00:14:06.360
seen it anymore because they are not super humane human.
You know what I mean?
No,

230
00:14:06.361 --> 00:14:09.850
I agree.
That's what your sport will be so messed up.
It will be crazy.

231
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.050
We're all going to be gamers.
Play video game.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.

232
00:14:14.051 --> 00:14:16.540
You're probably right.
We're not going to be gamers.
They're this,

233
00:14:16.541 --> 00:14:20.170
this will be m this thing that like being an athlete,

234
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:24.570
will it,
it's not gonna make any sense in the future,
I believe in,

235
00:14:24.571 --> 00:14:27.430
or maybe it will be completely ridiculous.
It's like,
oh,
you're not born.

236
00:14:27.431 --> 00:14:29.680
You're never going to be,
you have no choice.
You know what I mean?

237
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:33.410
And it will be real because you're not born to be an athlete.

238
00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:37.690
You're not bred to be an adult.
Yeah.
They,
with gene editing with their,

239
00:14:37.691 --> 00:14:42.040
they're going to be able to change your height.
They're going,
they can do it now.

240
00:14:42.041 --> 00:14:42.874
They can do it now.

241
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.880
They haven't really shown that they can do it with humans in America,
at least.

242
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.490
Crazy.
But they're absolutely experiencing are experimenting with it all over the

243
00:14:49.491 --> 00:14:52.640
world,
the cow and every like.
It's insane.
It's insane.

244
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:57.140
They're doing a lot of crazy shit.
Yeah.
And I think maybe it's a hundred years,

245
00:14:57.141 --> 00:15:00.410
maybe it's 50 years,
but whatever it is,
in that amount of time,

246
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.320
you're going to be dealing with people that are basically superheroes.
Yeah.

247
00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:07.460
Sport will be destroyed.
That's why when,
when that happen,

248
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:10.190
sport will be destroyed.
Yeah,
no,
I agree with spark.

249
00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.880
We'll be finish like the 100 meter.
Can you believe that?

250
00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:19.330
Freaking faster human being can be to be closer to zero second.
Yeah.

251
00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:23.290
Do you think would pass the bar of nine second one day?
It's terrible.

252
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:27.640
Are radically not impossible in a way in like,
I mean I won't point there.

253
00:15:27.641 --> 00:15:30.760
There's a line that you can't like,
you can't diminish that time,

254
00:15:30.761 --> 00:15:33.760
but it's like a of is,
you know like you can't,
you know,

255
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:38.200
but if we got that sort of performance and ensuing drug decks would be,

256
00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:41.200
but there'll probably be some sort of a side effect to it and some sort of a

257
00:15:41.201 --> 00:15:45.000
downside to it,
then you know,
they'd probably die younger.

258
00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.050
Their tissue will diminish faster.
But who knows?

259
00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.850
Maybe they'll be able to regenerate stuff if he,

260
00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:53.140
if you talk to some doctor that knows,
I know you have done,

261
00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.640
they said that steroid like it performance enhancing drug if you do it,

262
00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:02.190
if they do it well,
it's okay.
Some people don't have any side effect of it.
Right.

263
00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:07.000
They don't abuse it.
Yes.
Yeah.
So man,
maybe it won't have any side effect.

264
00:16:07.001 --> 00:16:09.730
Maybe everybody will be on it.
Maybe it would be like a,

265
00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:14.350
like a iPhone will be like,
oh,
that's like,
who knows?
Who knows the future?

266
00:16:14.351 --> 00:16:15.184
Who knows?
You know?

267
00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:24.810
<v 1>Okay.</v>
