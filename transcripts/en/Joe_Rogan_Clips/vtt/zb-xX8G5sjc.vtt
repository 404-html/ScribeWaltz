1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.810
[inaudible] on Youtube.
Everybody would like hundreds of people go.

2
00:00:03.811 --> 00:00:06.870
Like I just started watching that youtube recommended that to me.

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.340
Like how did that happen?
You know,

4
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.810
this little guy with a tow truck company does now pushed on everybody's laps and

5
00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:17.730
now he just went over 100,000 subscribers the other day and it was like months

6
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.030
ago that he was just had like 10 that that,
that's the argument.

7
00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:23.430
Some people have made that that's how fast the Paul brothers,

8
00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:26.970
they grew and they grew so fast on youtube that some people thought there was

9
00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:27.691
something up that game,

10
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:30.960
like millions of followers within a week or two of being on there and they were

11
00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:31.980
coming from another platform.

12
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.740
Well it's also coming from another platform is giant,

13
00:00:34.741 --> 00:00:39.450
but it's also all it really takes is one person deciding that whatever the fuck

14
00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:43.620
you did was funny or weird or crazy like that cashew outside girl.

15
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.690
Oh yeah.
Well there's that grows,
you know,

16
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.410
managed by the same people that own TMZ and that's why you see it on Tmz.

17
00:00:50.411 --> 00:00:52.240
Every guy was going to bring up,
if you want the fire,

18
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.260
the fire festival documentary,
there's a,
an explanation of this show,
how this,
uh,

19
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.510
they spread the,
the fuck Jerry guys,

20
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.020
the marketing teams spread that with the orange picture and it was a coordinated

21
00:01:02.021 --> 00:01:06.010
event over hundreds of different social media accounts for her,

22
00:01:06.011 --> 00:01:09.920
for the cash me outside girl for the fire festival.
Yeah.
Firefox to,

23
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.760
to catch everybody's,
because there are a team of people,

24
00:01:12.761 --> 00:01:16.780
there are agencies that have all this influence your accounts.
They pay them.

25
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.890
They don't have to accept the money or accept the offer except the campaign.

26
00:01:20.891 --> 00:01:25.420
But oftentimes they do.
So it's like a talent agency.
100%.
Yeah.
Yeah.

27
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.900
They don't need to share a new person,
your launch,
the next thing,
the next voice,

28
00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:30.910
and it's like,
oh,
here's a new song.
There's a new movie.

29
00:01:30.911 --> 00:01:32.660
It's just a new way to suppress stuff,
bro.

30
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.410
It's pretty cool watching how many people are unsubscribing?

31
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.390
Fuck Jerry and the fat Jew though.
That's it.
But are they,

32
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.880
I looked at it the other day.
It was day of like 14 million.

33
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.240
It was 500,000 in like a weekend really is a significant amount of I,

34
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.050
it really was 14.7 then it was 14.1 haven't looked whoa.

35
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.500
That's coming in from,
I think of video.
Someone shared this week.

36
00:01:54.501 --> 00:01:58.970
I think Vic Berger made a video that got spread around and they took his video,

37
00:01:58.971 --> 00:02:03.530
right?
Maybe.
Yeah,
that's what he said.
I think I saw it on Vicksburg burgers page.

38
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.960
Here's a few comics.
I have posted videos like,
Hey,
uh,
you know,

39
00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:11.160
fat Jews stole this.
I tried to reach out and they never got back to me.

40
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:14.410
He got 10 million w w what do you think about this idea though?

41
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.920
Like that's kind of piracy,
you know,
like,

42
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.620
and so Instagram is allowing and Twitter's allowing piracy.
Well,

43
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.060
I think they're allowing these people to post videos because you don't really

44
00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:31.140
know where it came from.
There's no proof.
Right?
Like if you find a meme,

45
00:02:31.141 --> 00:02:34.770
like how many times he posted a meme,
I repost whoever sent it to me.

46
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.150
If someone sends it to me,

47
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.780
but sometimes I'll just find it in a Google search and you've got to figure out

48
00:02:39.781 --> 00:02:40.920
who made that meme.

49
00:02:40.921 --> 00:02:43.950
And if I find their Instagram account then I'll try to find it and repost it.

50
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.640
But some people don't.
And I have it in the past like a,

51
00:02:47.641 --> 00:02:51.900
I did that one with a baked Alaska got mad at me cause there was one with Alex

52
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.970
Jones sitting in a hot tub and it's a,

53
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.480
it's like when your friends are trying to chill and,

54
00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.250
but you have to keep dropping truth bombs.
It was,
I didn't know it was his right.

55
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:02.110
I just posted it because someone sent to me,

56
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.680
someone sent it to me in a text message.
I think.
Um,

57
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.670
but those things have a creator.
Right.
And uh,

58
00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:13.270
I know Pete,
like Eddie Bravo makes his own.
He makes them sometimes,

59
00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:17.080
but he'll send some to me or post some online that he finds that are funny too.

60
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.630
And everybody tries to credit the person who did it right.

61
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.030
But now what they do is they,
they take it and they credit the person,

62
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.560
but they didn't for so long.
They're not attempt.

63
00:03:29.561 --> 00:03:31.450
They're crediting fake accounts.
So they'll make a,

64
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.820
so they're not getting busted in the way you were just explaining.

65
00:03:35.821 --> 00:03:37.630
I've seen that too.
Well what is that about though?

66
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:41.720
Cause that seems like deception the way around the back door and that

67
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.010
qualification of it needs to be on an account.
We need to point to somebody,
okay,

68
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.800
well we'll point to this account,
but it's not even a real account.
Right.

69
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.520
And if they find like they,

70
00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:53.560
they'll post stuff and then later add the person because the person contacts

71
00:03:53.561 --> 00:03:56.950
them and said,
they're almost like that's admitting to piracy.

72
00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.520
Like we did hire though.
I mean,
because if they just repost it,

73
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.470
a lot of folks including me do that.
Yeah.

74
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:07.000
But they're making the person making money or not.
Yeah.
Um,
that's important.

75
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.790
I don't make any money off my Instagram.
Right.
They're making millions.
Yeah.

76
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.980
I just,
uh,
I've been offered to post stuff up and I'm not saying that I wouldn't,

77
00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:19.390
if something was fucking killer and they wanted to give me money,
I'm greedy.

78
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.540
I'll take some money.
But I wouldn't lie about it.

79
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.360
An A and a I haven't yet.
I've never accepted any money yet.
Yeah.

80
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.070
Because it's also,
I think in Instagram's,
uh,
you know,

81
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.470
law that you have to put that it's an ad if you're making money off of it.

82
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.580
And so that's nother thing that both fuck Jerry and fat you are not doing,

83
00:04:39.581 --> 00:04:40.960
they're not putting in cad is it?

84
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.500
I just wanted like to devil's advocate this though is is there a place for them

85
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:45.281
for those accounts?

86
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:50.230
Like is there a place to have to be the re tweeter of the memes to be that guy

87
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:53.660
to be that account,
you know,
like Oh,
isn't that valuable?
So yes,

88
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.410
it is a curator position.
Yeah.
It's kind of valuable.

89
00:04:56.411 --> 00:05:00.700
But the question is like if it,
if it is valuable and it becomes something low,

90
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.490
almost like redistributing your standup.
If you're doing a set,

91
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.850
like if up sets where you know something that you just,

92
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.660
you could get everywhere and you could just repost it on your page,

93
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.510
but then your page became super popular because there are all these people stand

94
00:05:13.511 --> 00:05:17.590
up sets,
you know,
like a Spotify.
Spotify gets ads,
right,

95
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.170
but they don't really,
they pay the artists a little bit,

96
00:05:20.171 --> 00:05:21.940
but mostly they're making all the money.
Yeah.

97
00:05:21.941 --> 00:05:26.310
I don't know if it's like say sorry later you just do it and say,
I'm sorry,

98
00:05:26.311 --> 00:05:29.290
I'm gonna figure it out after the fact.
Or you figure it out.

99
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.350
Business oriented things that have art in them as opposed to art oriented,

100
00:05:35.561 --> 00:05:38.890
things that start making money.
There are two very different things.

101
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.590
So this is not an art thing.
This is a,

102
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:45.310
they find other people's art and they sell it.
They're pushing it,

103
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.460
they create these accounts.
The accounts get giant.

104
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.750
People pass it around because they're just finding funny things and then they

105
00:05:52.751 --> 00:05:53.561
start profiting.

106
00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:58.100
But all the people that created all the intellectual property get zero money,

107
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.620
which is weird.
I don't remember.

108
00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:04.190
But I only learned more about this when exit through the gift shop came out.

109
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.490
Isn't that what Andy Warhol sort of did?
I don't know and I don't care.

110
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.640
I mean maybe he did.
Maybe he did,
but the PR,

111
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.760
the thing about it is that this is happening right now on the Internet.

112
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.380
It's a totally different animal.
I mean,

113
00:06:15.381 --> 00:06:19.880
Andy Warhol wasn't running around taking exact photo duplicates and putting them

114
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:21.580
on his website for sale.
Like these are,

115
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.820
this is when someone's doing on an Instagram page is like you could within

116
00:06:25.821 --> 00:06:30.740
seconds take a piece and put it somewhere else.
It's seconds.

117
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.520
Brian posts something.
I think it's funny.
Ha.
I go to copy,

118
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.760
I go to the fucking repost at a APP.

119
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.210
I put it in there and repost it.
It's seconds later.

120
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.780
You could do that all day and if you hire kids,
I don't know,

121
00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.150
he has people working for them,
but if these guys do,

122
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:51.230
they hire people for fucking 20 bucks an hour or whatever and these people just

123
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.890
do it all day long.
They just find funny shit all day long.

124
00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:58.570
They look for certain hashtags,
meme factories or what they're calling.
Yeah.
Yeah.

125
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.590
And there's some people like,

126
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.980
you know that I've made some funny ones all their own.

127
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.070
You know a lot of people that are just doing that all I know delete has done a

128
00:07:07.071 --> 00:07:07.760
bunch of them.

129
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.870
And then there's also one that they do where they steal people's act and make a

130
00:07:11.871 --> 00:07:14.570
meme out of it and then posted on their page.

131
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.840
That's where it gets even more slippery because you'd talking about like

132
00:07:17.841 --> 00:07:21.350
standups,
acts the you,
you're,
you're making money off it.

133
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.690
How much are they making off each post?
I mean,
I don't know,

134
00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:26.370
but these are multimillion dollar business and the punchline.

135
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.990
So now you have this 10 minute joke that everyone has the punchline because they

136
00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:34.040
saw it on Facebook.
That's like,
spoiler alert Klein for sure.

137
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.410
If you're still doing that material.

138
00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:39.020
It wasn't on Netflix or a comedy central special or something for sure.

139
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:43.010
That sucks.
I guess it's just,
it's always happened though,
hasn't it?
TV shows.

140
00:07:43.011 --> 00:07:47.680
I've been accused of stealing a,
oh,
they have stolen.
It's happened on dude.

141
00:07:47.681 --> 00:07:50.600
They did it to Kevin.
James,
I saw it happen.

142
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.240
Kevin James was at the,
uh,

143
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:57.650
he had a development deal for NBC back in the [inaudible] back when we were

144
00:07:57.651 --> 00:08:01.280
young pups.
Both of us are like 27 or some shit.

145
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.950
Maybe he's a little older than that.
Maybe.
It's actually,

146
00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:08.090
that was like during the news radio days.
So we're probably like in our thirties.

147
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.870
Um,
and he had this development deal,
nice development deal.

148
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.190
They're paying them on a lot of,
a lot of cash,
a lot of paper and a,

149
00:08:16.191 --> 00:08:18.260
they were setting up a sitcom around him.

150
00:08:18.261 --> 00:08:22.320
So they had him do a set at a theater in Hollywood.
And uh,

151
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:26.120
I was there and he does this set and has all these writers from various sitcoms

152
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.970
and the very next season,

153
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:34.240
one of his best jokes is on an episode of a television show that's very popular.

154
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:41.420
Very popular.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And uh,

155
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.880
they fucking stole his bit,
man.
I guess that's where I was going to,

156
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:47.990
cause that was in the 90s.
So like we're now 25,
20,
25 years later,

157
00:08:47.991 --> 00:08:52.640
the new popular medium is Instagram and social media.
Yeah.
But different is that,

158
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.800
well it's different because there's accountability now.

159
00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:59.280
Cause people know that if you wrote a meme and you put it up on your site and

160
00:08:59.281 --> 00:09:03.630
then a fuck Jerry comes along and steals your shit and doesn't credit you for it

161
00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:04.740
and just puts it up there,

162
00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:09.600
you know what they did unless someone sent it to them and didn't attribute it to

163
00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:11.040
you,
which is possible.

164
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.870
But it seems much more likely that what they're doing,

165
00:09:15.871 --> 00:09:18.040
they were doing on purpose for the longest time and they just,

166
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.210
they thought that's what you could do on the Internet.
It's a wild west.

167
00:09:21.211 --> 00:09:25.230
You could just take memes and you can become famous and looked at fat Jewish
guy,

168
00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:28.580
did it.
I mean that guy became famous with whether you,
uh,

169
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:33.300
agree with his methods or not.
It worked.
He,
he's got his crazy hair.

170
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.470
You shows you,
you know,

171
00:09:34.471 --> 00:09:38.820
like he's just crazy looking guy and he has all these funny memes that somebody

172
00:09:38.821 --> 00:09:43.620
else wrote and they're all up on his Instagram page and it worked and people

173
00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:45.900
don't like him.
Now there's a lot of people that don't like him.

174
00:09:45.901 --> 00:09:47.760
People get real shitty with them in person.

175
00:09:47.761 --> 00:09:49.950
They don't want him to do an appearance as they know what he did.

176
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.060
So there's a certain number of people that go,
hey man,
you're a thief.

177
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:57.030
Like this is not cool.
Like what you did is not cool.

178
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.240
But then there's certain people that don't care and then there's certain people

179
00:10:00.241 --> 00:10:03.990
that think,
well,
what he did was just what anybody did back then.

180
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.330
It was the wild west.
No one thought about it.

181
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:09.420
And once he established that business model and it was effective,

182
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.440
it was probably very hard for him to slow it down or to attribute things to

183
00:10:13.441 --> 00:10:17.190
people or to admit that he didn't do it for all that amount of time.

184
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:23.100
It just bugs me that companies pay these guys knowing that they do this or like

185
00:10:23.101 --> 00:10:24.630
as a fat Jew,
he's like,
see,

186
00:10:24.631 --> 00:10:28.530
he's like sign with ca who's signed with a bunch of comedians they probably
took,

187
00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:33.020
it's taken from the same basket.
So it's like it is weird,
right?
Yeah.

188
00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:37.770
Now if he was going on stage and doing their acts,
he's been doing appearances.

189
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:41.610
Right.
He's got a book.
He's been on TV shows.
Well,
I don't know what's in,

190
00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:45.010
I don't know what he's doing,
what he's doing,
but maybe showing him,
but he's,

191
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:48.840
look,
he's obviously used it for profit.
He's figured out a way to profit.

192
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:49.823
It's weird.

193
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:53.790
He must be weirded out by this fuck Jerry thing too because you might be
sitting,

194
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:58.200
must be sitting there going,
okay,
all right.
Here.
I was going to leave me alone.

195
00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.300
It's um,
you know,

196
00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:05.980
comedy central was advertising on the fuck Jerry Page,

197
00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:10.860
which is like Jesus folks.
I didn't know that.
Yeah.
It was like Jesus folks,

198
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:16.020
can I just say you guys down,
go over a little history of comedy.

199
00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.890
Well,
I mean mind him and see I,
they didn't learn then either,
you know.

200
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.100
Well that was while it was happening,
you know?
Yeah,
they did learn.

201
00:11:23.101 --> 00:11:25.020
Eventually they let it go eventually.

202
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.550
But that was also because the ratings have dropped through the floor floor.

203
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:33.340
You know,
comedy's not fucking easy to make up,
you know,

204
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:37.780
especially like meme kind of comedy that's done by folks that are working in

205
00:11:37.781 --> 00:11:39.360
offices,
meme kind of comedy.

206
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:43.420
Some of the funniest fucking comedy on earth and it's done by regular people.

207
00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.673
It's not like a,

208
00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:51.070
it's not like most memes are written by high level satirists that worked for the

209
00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:56.980
New Yorker?
No,
they're regular folks who think something's funny.
You know,

210
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.180
I think what's going to happen is as technology improves the like being able to

211
00:12:01.181 --> 00:12:05.050
scan a photo and go where are we could tell the first time this has ever been on

212
00:12:05.051 --> 00:12:06.880
the Internet was from this little girl.

213
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:11.260
She took a photo of it has all the data in the picture and it's now used on this

214
00:12:11.261 --> 00:12:13.050
meme that's making this much money and this.

215
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.870
Then it's going to be kind of broken down like you know like any kind of
artists.

216
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:18.543
Yes.

217
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.510
I mean that's the idea for the buyer and the argument for the blockchain getting

218
00:12:22.511 --> 00:12:24.610
involved in here because I could tie that you can,

219
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.820
I guess it can be in the data like no.
Let me ask you this.

220
00:12:27.821 --> 00:12:32.440
What if someone uses a picture of a your band,
so you have a band,

221
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:36.220
they use a picture of your band and then they have a funny meme under the

222
00:12:36.221 --> 00:12:39.440
picture of your band.
Who owns that then?
That's what I have.

223
00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.400
Like I think Beyonce tried to get that picture taken off the Internet from her

224
00:12:42.401 --> 00:12:45.160
from the super bowl a couple of years ago because it was like a bad picture.

225
00:12:45.161 --> 00:12:47.980
It she didn't like how she looked in it.
That's hilarious.
Yeah,

226
00:12:47.981 --> 00:12:51.340
but how the fuck is that lady take a bad picture?
I just,

227
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:55.630
she does some of these talk to her.
Yeah,
it's good.
It's not your best,

228
00:12:55.631 --> 00:12:58.330
but you look fucking great.
Like if that shit was on Tinder,

229
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.540
you know you wouldn't be on,
it's like shit did it.

230
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:03.910
Who if someone was paying for that meme,

231
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.780
it should be on say get some of the money or that's the question that you would

232
00:13:07.781 --> 00:13:09.790
have would be like a corporation,
right?

233
00:13:09.791 --> 00:13:13.150
Which should someone be able to grab photos that are out in the public domain,

234
00:13:13.151 --> 00:13:17.880
make something with it and then profit.
That's the way this is it.

235
00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:18.701
A lot of bands.

236
00:13:18.701 --> 00:13:21.610
I'm sure that's why I said banks cause they were like really good at protecting

237
00:13:21.611 --> 00:13:25.420
copyright and their logo and shit.
If you had like the kiss band logo,

238
00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.280
you don't think gene Simmons had come at you.

239
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.400
He's coming at you with some lawyers 100% right.

240
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.820
That's just what he's going to do.
But it's who owns those photos?

241
00:13:33.821 --> 00:13:37.510
If it's like gene Simmons like spitting fire out and I think if you took the

242
00:13:37.511 --> 00:13:41.380
photo and cameras were allowed inside the event,
you took it.

243
00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:44.110
It's not what the case is though.

244
00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:47.140
Most of the photographs or people that are putting up there,

245
00:13:47.141 --> 00:13:50.680
just putting them up online and someone takes it like say if you gene Simmons

246
00:13:50.681 --> 00:13:54.460
spitting fire and then it has a joke about eating the hookers posted or

247
00:13:54.461 --> 00:13:58.720
something like whatever it is,
fill it.
Make something funny there.

248
00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:03.990
But like if that's online and that becomes this giant meme that gets all these

249
00:14:04.031 --> 00:14:06.580
likes and that somehow or another someone pro,

250
00:14:06.581 --> 00:14:09.250
how the fuck do you profit from you from Instagram?

251
00:14:09.251 --> 00:14:11.020
You don't profit from individual posts,

252
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.330
but those individual posts will boost your signal.
Yeah.

253
00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:18.790
Some posts start profited Instagram.
Yeah.
You have to say,
add on.

254
00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:22.840
It has to say sponsored post.
Right.
What?

255
00:14:22.841 --> 00:14:27.250
Legally you're supposed to,
I'd probably say 90% of them aren't.
Right.

256
00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:29.750
A lot of people don't write,
especially if it's like instant.
