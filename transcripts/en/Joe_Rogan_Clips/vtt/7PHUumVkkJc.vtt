1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.150
What's really fucked up is reading about animals that that fight like right out

2
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:11.510
of the womb.
How they kill their partner.
They killed siblicide.
Yeah.

3
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.110
Put it.

4
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.850
Pull up an obligate siblicide in blue and Nazca boobies.

5
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.690
What are those?
What's the Nazca Boobie?

6
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.760
Did they live in the Nazca lines or are these,
what are these boobies?
Jamie,

7
00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:29.890
help me out here.
We're hanging out in the word Boobie Boobie.
I'm still stuck.

8
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.620
How do you spell that?
And a z.
Ca and then boobies.

9
00:00:34.621 --> 00:00:35.454
The usual way.

10
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.820
I'm trying to remember what I was reading about where obligate siblicide.

11
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.660
When one animal comes out,

12
00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:46.950
the other one trust to kill the other one almost immediately has to hyenas.

13
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.190
Hyenas,
hyenas.
There's been,

14
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.790
there's been evidence of hyenas attacking their sibling while it's in the

15
00:00:55.831 --> 00:01:00.540
embryonic sack and theirs when they come out,

16
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.140
the bigger one or the stronger one of the ones,
whatever ones healthy,
well,

17
00:01:04.141 --> 00:01:08.130
almost immediately started attacking its sibling and try to kill it.

18
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.440
Pull up that.
If that's true,
I'm pretty sure that's true.
I want to see boobs.

19
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.200
I went into this,
uh,
I went to this crazy rabbit hole about hyenas recently.

20
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.170
What a bizarre animal that is.
So this,
the,
the,

21
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.420
the false penis.
Yeah,
the false penis is just one aspect of everything.

22
00:01:24.421 --> 00:01:27.630
Everything about 20% of the women die.
Okay.
Here it goes.

23
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.620
Obligate simple civil size.
When a sibling almost always ends up being killed.

24
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.070
Fugitive siblicide means the suicide fo Facul tive like it's a choice versus you

25
00:01:38.111 --> 00:01:40.380
gotta do tackle tative faculty.

26
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.910
Facultative silver siblicide means a siblicide may or may not occur based on

27
00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:46.650
environmental conditions.
Okay.

28
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.430
So it's sometimes will happen if there's none of resources.

29
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.080
So the idea is that the,
I think the breeding cycle is [inaudible].

30
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.590
So you either make it or you don't.

31
00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.650
And so the danger of laying one egg and having it not work out is very,

32
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.490
oh this bird is fucking,

33
00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:05.130
this is brother up and it has to be in front of mom and dad.

34
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.060
Cause you want to prove that you're worthy.
Wow.
That is insane.
Right?
So Mommy,

35
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.540
look at it,
beating it to death.
So this is because there's not enough food,

36
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.400
there's not enough food to do two.
So the first one,
the second one is a spare,

37
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.930
and the first one proves,
proves that he's worthy by killing his sibling,

38
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.530
the spare in front of the parents and says,
yeah,
you can invest in me.

39
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.920
I got this thing.
He uses Christ.
And what kind of bird is this?

40
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.320
This is probably Nazca or blue footed boobies is my guess.

41
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.170
That is saying that is insane.
It's hard to watch.
Well,

42
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.580
this is what I said about biology.

43
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.310
Biology cares about your feelings and the mom doesn't give a fuck about right

44
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.800
her.
The mom the mom wants.
Look,
the mom's excited.
This one's dying,

45
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.480
not fucked up.
And the mom's like,
can hey,
the older one knows what it's doing.

46
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.010
He's viable.
Jesus Christ.
Nature's pretty brutal,
pretty brutal.

47
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.030
Now it's,
it's bizarre seeing this from,
Oh God,

48
00:02:57.031 --> 00:02:58.680
I don't want to see this thing slowly die.
Dude.

49
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.910
It's bizarre seeing it from birds,
but a,

50
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:04.210
I think it's even more ruthless the way lions,
hyenas,

51
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.550
hyenas killing their siblings.
That almost,
uh,

52
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.640
I think they were saying it's pretty universal.

53
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:12.490
That is when the first one comes out,
they tried to kill the soccer one.
You know,

54
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:15.790
this thing about lion female lions getting excited by the murder of their

55
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:20.680
children.
Whoa.
So when the new,
when the new mail takes over the pride,

56
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.550
his first order of business may be let's stop wasting resources on the previous,

57
00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:30.160
uh,
daddy's a offspring.
Yeah.
So what happens?

58
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.201
Same kind of thing.

59
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:36.820
The hyena gets out and immediately starts killing its sibling.

60
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.040
They're fighting to the death right out of the womb.

61
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:42.800
Look at this fucking mad battle as babies like it's got,

62
00:03:42.801 --> 00:03:46.120
it's still got the sack on it and they're just trying to kill each other.

63
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.480
This is a particularly ruthless animal.
There were,

64
00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:56.481
there were saying that I'm 60% of a hyenas die as they're trying to get out of

65
00:03:57.451 --> 00:04:01.620
the tube.
Wow.
What?
I didn't know that.
Yeah.

66
00:04:01.621 --> 00:04:05.790
20% of women die,
whether it females rather die when they're giving birth.

67
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.230
But that's because of our crazy brain to body ratio.
So say,

68
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.500
say they have no female hyenas.
Oh,
so that giant Dick,
sorry,

69
00:04:13.501 --> 00:04:17.160
I thought you were talking about high rates of human neutrality.

70
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.130
Female Hyena die 20% of the time when they're giving birth.
All right,

71
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:24.510
because the baby doesn't come out right.
Like they have this crazy,
you know,

72
00:04:24.511 --> 00:04:28.520
they have a pho penis that is actually a vagina.
It's a,
it's an enormous,

73
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.800
huge and gorge cliteracy.
It's far bigger than the males.

74
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.410
They have to pull it back so the male can copulate with them.

75
00:04:34.411 --> 00:04:37.890
But then when they give birth,
he has to come out of that Dick and they don't,

76
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.800
it doesn't always come out right.
So like,
yeah,

77
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.040
Google that because I might be wrong about the numbers,

78
00:04:44.041 --> 00:04:48.720
but it's some exorbitant number of babies die and a huge number of women,

79
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.890
women,
I keep saying women,
female hygiene is died.
That's why I fuck up.

80
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.190
But they're also weird and that they're way bigger than the males.

81
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.770
And that's the,
because the males won't let the babies eat.

82
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.360
So this one of the things they think like if something is,
they're scavengers,

83
00:05:02.361 --> 00:05:05.130
the males are trying to push out everything smaller.
So because of that,

84
00:05:05.131 --> 00:05:07.470
the females have to get in and go fuck off.

85
00:05:07.471 --> 00:05:10.290
The kid has to eat like even if it's their kid that's cool.

86
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.360
60% suffocate on their way out.
60% of them die on the way out.

87
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.220
Yeah,
and I think it's 20% of the females die during childbirth as well.

88
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.420
Pretty sure.
That's what I read,
which is fucking bananas.

89
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.550
I mean 60% though.

90
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.080
Imagine 60% of all kids die on the way out and then the ones that don't die,

91
00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:32.820
if you got two of them,
one of them kills the other one.

92
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.380
It's a rough neighborhood.
Oh,

93
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.170
it's matriarchal society and they get birth through that fake penis.
Yeah,

94
00:05:40.171 --> 00:05:42.840
that's what I'm saying.
What is the purpose of the fake penis?

95
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.760
Would it take penis is a dominate the men.

96
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.570
They'd get on top of the bed and they go,
listen bitch.
So it's going to be,

97
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.600
and they've got a big old strap on.
They pegged their men at all.

98
00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:55.440
Male hyenas are cooks.
They all take,
it's crazy.
It's crazy.

99
00:05:55.441 --> 00:06:00.080
That's where we're heading is a condition diameter,
really.
Jesus.

100
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.270
Ouch.
Tight suite.
Which that's,

101
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.180
that creates a high death rate for first time mothers.
Yeah.

102
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.770
High death rate doesn't say here how many,
but I think it's 20%.
The,

103
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.090
uh,
like the full human cliteracy yes.
I've seen one.

104
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.690
Have you,
uh,
not in the water.
