00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.580
Well,
how will it work in his mouth?
Yeah.

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.070
That's why some of those personal care products are kind of scary,

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.060
but a CBD product.
Yeah.
Like personal care for that,

4
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.600
like parabens and phthalates and you know,
estrogen,
you know,

5
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:15.990
the Fido estrogens and endocrine disruptors and stuff like that and them,
I mean,

6
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.980
you know,
they've,
they've done,
they've done studies where,
you know,
like,

7
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.210
like guys will like take a shower with the average shampoo that's got,
you know,

8
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.850
like parabens and phthalates and these things that that can be endocrine

9
00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:31.500
disruptors or,
or phytoestrogen and you know,
mimic estrogen in a man's body.

10
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.490
And they actually,
within a short period of time,

11
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.460
after taking the shower and using these care products,

12
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.770
you can actually detect this stuff in their urine.

13
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.660
Like your body is actually soaking this up and absorbing.
It was the very,

14
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.090
very interesting book.
Uh,
interviewed this guy.

15
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.100
My podcast is called esterow generation about how many guys have really high

16
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:57.900
estrogen levels now from primarily their personal care products or their

17
00:00:57.901 --> 00:01:00.630
household cleaning chemicals.
So it's true.
That's tough.

18
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.330
Trying to turn you into a bitch.
Yeah,
it is.

19
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:07.250
More or less guy's house and you see a bunch of his sweet smelling shampoos

20
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.340
surprise me.
Like,
like when I raced for,
for a team Timex,

21
00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:12.730
we used the train out at the,

22
00:01:12.731 --> 00:01:17.340
the giant stadium in New Jersey and I go in the locker room there and it's just

23
00:01:17.341 --> 00:01:19.160
like this.
You'd think that the,

24
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.180
the peak of performance and professional sports would have started looking into

25
00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:25.021
by this point,

26
00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:29.190
how could you keep testosterone is high as possible on a male athletes body.

27
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.910
Right?

28
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.960
But you walk into the bathroom and it's just like every end of can disrupt or

29
00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:38.430
known demand just like lined up in a pretty shiny row there on the shelf in

30
00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:41.510
front of the meeting of the shaving cream and the shampoos and the spray

31
00:01:41.511 --> 00:01:46.320
deodorant.
Just like,
yeah,
I mean any,
I did not all shaving cream,

32
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.130
but if it's,
if it's something that has those kinds of chemicals in it,

33
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.550
absolutely.
Have you ever used Dr Carver's shave butter?

34
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.440
That sounds familiar.
It's a,
it's a,
uh,
dollar shave club product.

35
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.710
It's the most incredible shaving cream of all time.

36
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.830
Like you'll regular shaving cream if you will.
You won't.

37
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.110
You just won't use it after you try that stuff.

38
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.220
I think I've tried that because he's just,
this probably happens to you.

39
00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:15.920
You get lots of lots of personal care products since your studio home.
Yeah,

40
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.380
but that stuff blows me away.
It's like a butter.
I mean,

41
00:02:18.381 --> 00:02:22.170
it's called the Dr Carver's.
Yeah.
Huh.
Yeah.
Interesting.

42
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.240
I'll get them sent us out off the trial to try and be blown away by.

43
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.660
I don't have to shave that much,
so don't have him send very much.

44
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.570
You don't cheat.
You don't grow a lot of eyes on a girl.
A lot of facial hair.
No.
