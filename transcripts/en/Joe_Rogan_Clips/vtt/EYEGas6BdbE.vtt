00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.750
When you see,
uh,
you know,
uh,
10,000 hours only sign,

2
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.620
uh,
you know,
only those who've done their 10,000 hours can come in.

3
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.250
My middle finger goes up.
I'm like,

4
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.580
I bet it's not 10,000 hours or if it is 10,000 hours,

5
00:00:15.581 --> 00:00:20.230
I'm willing to get 80% of the juice in that orange with like 10% of the effort.

6
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.390
Mm.
Well the 10,000 hours thing to me is a,

7
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.620
it's cute,
but it doesn't factor in for phenoms.

8
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.520
It doesn't,
there's,
there's a lot of people that come into anything,

9
00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:37.810
whatever it is,
with some natural abilities that are pretty undeniable.

10
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.140
Um,
you know,
that's a weird,
that's a weird equation.

11
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.970
But like take,
take something very simple like the harmonica.
Yeah.

12
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.890
Most people don't know that that's sweet.

13
00:00:50.891 --> 00:00:55.000
Blues sound on a harmonica comes from not using it the way the manufacturer
said,

14
00:00:55.001 --> 00:01:00.001
which is called straight harp and using it instead the way African Americans

15
00:01:00.011 --> 00:01:00.581
figured it out,

16
00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:05.410
which is it's much cooler to base it around a hole that nobody was expecting to

17
00:01:05.411 --> 00:01:09.880
draw rather than for blow.
And that gives you a seventh chord.

18
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.020
That sounds like sweet blues music.
If you give me some of that.
All right.

19
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.893
I don't know how this will work.

20
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.260
<v 1>Oh,
Paul,</v>

21
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.970
<v 0>I think that was,
you got to move.
But so what's the traditional way of using it?</v>

22
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.833
What would it sound like?

23
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.800
I think that would be Carmen pouring.
It's fuck boy,
apple music.

24
00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:52.520
Boring as fuck white people meet God damn it.
White people at Carmen's.
All right,

25
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.380
but look,
that's not my point.

26
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.280
Who knew when you get one of these things as a party favor as a kid,

27
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.800
there's not somebody who says,
Hey,

28
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.230
don't do that thing where you put your mouth over it.
I'll say,
you know,

29
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.370
but who knew that that's the cooler.
There's,
yeah,

30
00:02:07.371 --> 00:02:09.770
but like the idea is that there's something called tongue blocking.

31
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.740
There's something called cross harp and there's something called the one four

32
00:02:12.741 --> 00:02:16.730
five progression with a scale that no music teacher ever taught you in a grade

33
00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:19.580
school in piano.
All right?
So there's four secrets

34
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.020
and now suddenly the world opens up.
I mean,

35
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.230
when I opened for Jordan Peterson,
Dave Rubin invited me and they said,
you know,

36
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.690
why don't you play a minute worth of harmonica at the Masonic Theater?

37
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.590
So for 2,500 people,
I became Dave Rubin's talking Harmonica Monkey.

38
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.250
Uh,
so I opened for Jordan Peterson.
I said,
you know,
rule number zero,

39
00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:42.140
life is too short not to play the harmonica.

40
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.830
Everyone should learn to play the harmonica or know why they're not doing it.

41
00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:49.280
There's this great thing in the cal Berkeley fight song will win the game or no,

42
00:02:49.281 --> 00:02:52.910
the reason why if you don't play the harmonica,

43
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.110
it's so nice.
It's so simple.
So few people do it.
They're so small.

44
00:02:57.111 --> 00:03:01.900
Number of secrets.
You have to have a reason because I can feed myself.
I can,

45
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.990
I can get housing,
shelter,
I can meet people anywhere in the world.

46
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:07.720
All I have to do is carry around a piece of plastic with some metal on it.

47
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.040
Or you can be annoying like a lot of people like turn that fucking guy off.

48
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:14.710
Why is he,
why is he playing that Goddamn Damn Harmonica?
I want to hear that.

49
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.450
Put it back in your pocket.
You go to your next trip,

50
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.260
you already tainted and these people's estimation guys attention whore out here

51
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.100
like,
well,
what's worse?

52
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.020
A harmonica or a guy brings a guitar and start singing folk songs at a party on

53
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.210
the animal house effect,
right?
Yeah.
Beat him over the head with the guitar.

54
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.540
He can shred.
He's going to be fine.
It's great.

55
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:37.600
If you are looking to hear someone tread,
that's up.
Okay.

56
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.770
All of these things are like options of financial options.

57
00:03:40.771 --> 00:03:43.750
You can exercise them or you cannot exercise.
You don't have to exercise.

58
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:44.410
But I mean,

59
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.350
there's an equal number of things that people would say that are like the

60
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:52.060
Harmonica.
Like,
uh,
you should be able to do slam poetry,
right?

61
00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:55.000
Everyone should be able to do slam poetry.
If you can't do slam poetry,

62
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.330
I can feed myself.
I can house,
I can,
I can do slam poetry.

63
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.130
I'll show up at a party and everyone wants to hear slam poetry.
Is that true?

64
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.300
You're just trying to bait me.
Joe,
you're so adorable.
