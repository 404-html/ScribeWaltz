1
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.870
Her low freak bitches did.
To me,

2
00:00:03.871 --> 00:00:05.910
that's as a person who's never been in the military.
That's,

3
00:00:05.911 --> 00:00:09.420
it's one of the fascinating aspects of how it works is like how,

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.430
how do you get all these different people to follow through on a plan and who

5
00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:18.750
are the leaders and why did the leaders have the right ideas and who educates

6
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:21.360
them as to how they have the right idea to having the right ideas.

7
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.650
Like I know that a lot of people are excited about where the military is right

8
00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:28.790
now.
Like Tim Kennedy re enlisted and he ran the lesson.
Yeah,

9
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.130
he realistic because he believes that the military has support now and look,

10
00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:35.820
Tim Kennedy's believes he was put on this earth to kill bad guys and that's what

11
00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:38.280
he wants to do.
I mean,
you want to think,
I agree with Tim candidate.

12
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.030
I think I agree with them too.
For sure.
Obviously he enjoys it.
I mean,

13
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.870
he's not fucking around.
And he's,
he went back and he put his in his,

14
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.450
his money where his mouth is and in his eyes that this is,

15
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.720
you know,
this is the way that it should have been,

16
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.950
that you should give the military the chance to do their job.
That's their idea.

17
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.370
And then other people believe that there should be much more civilian oversight

18
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.080
and they should be much more,

19
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.630
much more checks and balances before things get done.
This is a,

20
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.990
this is a big debate that's going on today.
Well,

21
00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:11.790
I think there's two different things that you just talked about.

22
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.950
That is what the military gets told to do and how they do it.

23
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.030
And those are two different things.
And I think that yes,
you absolutely,

24
00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:24.930
the civilians should control and do control the military,
by the way,

25
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.030
they do control,
the civilians are under,

26
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.140
or the military is under controlled civilians and yet once you say,
okay,

27
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:32.490
this is what we want to have happen,

28
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.420
you need to let the military professionals figure out how they're going to go

29
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.410
and make it happen.
Yeah,
that's,
that's where it gets tricky,
right?

30
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.000
Because if you're in the,

31
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:46.050
like one of the things that was explained to me by a friend who's a navy seal,

32
00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:51.051
he was saying that when something needs to get done and you have all these

33
00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:54.960
people that are telling you how you can do it,
how you can't do it,

34
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.880
that [inaudible] people that are not experiencing combat and don't understand

35
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:00.390
what,

36
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.390
what could or could not go sideways like to put more problems in place or to put

37
00:02:05.851 --> 00:02:07.230
more checks and balances in place,

38
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.950
you're actually going to put these people in more danger that that is true.
Yeah,

39
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.120
you should.
Like I said,

40
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.010
if you let the civilians decide what it is that needs to be accomplished and

41
00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:20.630
then the military leaders decide how they're going to go ahead and make that,

42
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.090
that happened and I mean it goes back to,
it goes back to Vietnam.
You know,

43
00:02:24.091 --> 00:02:29.040
there was too much civilian oversight of what was happening in Vietnam and the

44
00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:32.790
military leaders were,
they didn't really have the,

45
00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:35.310
the the wherewithal,
not even the wherewithal.

46
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.010
They didn't have the free reign to go out and try and make things happen the way

47
00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:42.090
they wanted to and it ended up in a big quagmire.
Well,
Vietnam seems like to me,

48
00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:45.720
from an outsider to be one of the most fucked up wars ever.
Absolutely.

49
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.540
It didn't totally make sense that it was happening.

50
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.220
And then now we know that the Gulf of Gulf of Tonkin was very likely a false

51
00:02:53.221 --> 00:02:56.310
flag and that there was some sort of motivation to get there in the first place.

52
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.470
And then you're dealing with guerrilla warfare for the first time ever in US

53
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:03.790
history.
Like they didn't exactly know how to handle this.
No,
we didn't.

54
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:07.390
And we didn't adapt very well to what was happening on the ground,

55
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.560
which is always going to be problematic if you have closed minded people in the

56
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:13.940
military,
if people are close mind they're there,

57
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.170
you're not going to be able to move forward against,
uh,
when,

58
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.060
when the battlefield changes and the battlefield changes all the time.
I mean,

59
00:03:19.061 --> 00:03:20.500
you can look at Iraq,
Iraq,

60
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:24.400
the battlefield change drastically from this big conventional force that we went

61
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:27.880
up there to fight against Saddam big army.
Well,
once that fell apart,

62
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:28.600
then what happened?

63
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.960
Now all of a sudden we were facing gorillas again and an insurgency and it took

64
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:36.160
us several years to change our strategy from,
we didn't even know what to do.

65
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.860
Oh my God.
You know,
what do we do?
There's all these people running around.

66
00:03:38.861 --> 00:03:41.800
What do we do with these all these people running around and how do we get these

67
00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:42.820
people under control and,

68
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.600
and the civilians want us here and yet if we don't do the right thing now,

69
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.790
the civilians don't want us here.
What do we need to do?

70
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:51.610
So it took us some time to adjust our strategy in Iraq.

71
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.690
And Luckily we had some good leaders that that went ahead and made those
changes.

72
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.340
Isn't it also that when,

73
00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.420
when you're in war and the strategy and not the strategy,

74
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:02.590
but the motivation is very clear.

75
00:04:02.591 --> 00:04:04.870
Like if you fight against Hitler's army in World War II,

76
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.600
but this is very clear that you're dealing with an evil force.

77
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.680
Whereas in Vietnam it's like,
wait a minute,
why are we here?
Like what's going on?

78
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.330
Communism,
what's happening?
Extremely,
extremely challenging,

79
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.460
no doubt.
And that that is why,
you know,
I've talked about this before,

80
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.140
if if America or any nation is going to go to war,

81
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.820
you have to decide that this is the most important thing in the world.

82
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.760
You have to end the wills that I talk about,
that you have to have to,

83
00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:35.620
to execute this war you've got to have,

84
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.730
you've got to have the will to kill people.
And,
and again,

85
00:04:39.731 --> 00:04:43.360
I say this all the time,
no one wants to hear it because it's ugly and horrible.

86
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.340
But when you say you're going to kill people in war,

87
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.850
you're not just going to be able to perfectly kill just the bad guys.

88
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.290
Civilians are going to die.
It is a nightmare.
Kids,

89
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.640
women,
it's horrible.
It's awful.
And if you think,
oh,

90
00:04:57.641 --> 00:04:59.350
I'm going to go to war and we're just going to kill the bad guys,

91
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.440
it's not going to happen in war is too complex.
It's just not going to be,

92
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.271
it'd be saying like,
Hey,

93
00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:06.220
I'm gonna go and fight in the UFC and I'm not going to get hit.

94
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.190
It's not going to happen.
You're going to get hit,
you're going to get bruised up,

95
00:05:09.191 --> 00:05:11.620
you're going to get dinged.
And it's the same thing in war.

96
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.650
So you have to have the will to kill people.
Of course,

97
00:05:14.651 --> 00:05:16.360
it's easy to have the will to kill the bad guys,

98
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.530
but then you have to accept the fact that some innocent people are going to die

99
00:05:20.531 --> 00:05:23.530
and that is going to be awful.
And then on the other side of the coin is,

100
00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:27.040
of course,
if you're going to send people to war people,

101
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.310
Americans are going to die.
And there's nothing you can do about it.

102
00:05:30.311 --> 00:05:33.210
You have to accept that fact.
And you know,

103
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.220
that's why Vietnam was just the ultimate tragedy in many respects because we

104
00:05:38.711 --> 00:05:41.410
were killing a lot of civilians.
We were losing a lot of Americans.

105
00:05:41.411 --> 00:05:44.710
But we weren't progressing the way we needed to.
It was a nightmare.

106
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.660
I agree with you 100% what do you think about transparency?
Like,
uh,

107
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.530
when the Bush administration wouldn't let them take photographs of coffins and,

108
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.640
and send them home.

109
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.890
Like a lot of people were really upset because there's a lot of people that felt

110
00:05:57.891 --> 00:05:58.311
like,
look,

111
00:05:58.311 --> 00:06:02.510
American should know that there's a cost to this and they should know that

112
00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:04.340
there's consequences to these actions.

113
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.040
And they were saying that these consequences and knowing about these

114
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:09.590
consequences could lessen morale,

115
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.080
could lessen support back at home when they really need it.

116
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.840
And the people didn't really need to know this and that.

117
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.210
What they need to know is we're on the right track and we're doing well.
I,

118
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:18.290
that's a tough one.

119
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.710
And whether it's the right decision to keep the Americans and their beautiful

120
00:06:21.711 --> 00:06:24.470
bubble that they live in and let them know that this war is happening,

121
00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:26.070
but you don't have to see the,

122
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.720
the brave Americans coming home that are sacrificed their lives.

123
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.550
And interestingly,
if you remember,
I think it was Tara,

124
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.150
what the battle Atar when World War II and for the first time.
So we were,

125
00:06:38.151 --> 00:06:41.630
we needed money to run World War II,
a lot of money,
war bonds and all that.

126
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.720
And we were kind of falling behind and we needed some money.

127
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:50.140
And one of the first times that they released a lot of pictures of American dead

128
00:06:51.291 --> 00:06:53.900
Americans was,
I think it was the battle of Tarawa.

129
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.810
And there was all these Americans washing up on the beach.

130
00:06:56.811 --> 00:07:00.440
I mean marines that had drowned and got shot and it was awful.

131
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.890
But they did it for a reason.
They did it to show like,
hey,
this is real.

132
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.860
This is happening.
We need to put pitch in,
we need money,
we need to,
you know,

133
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.230
Save,
save,
meet,
save,
uh,
the oil,

134
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.010
don't use your cars.
We all need to get in for the big win.
Right?

135
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.400
And that's the opposite of what we're talking about when they're saying,
hey,

136
00:07:19.401 --> 00:07:22.670
you're not allowed to take pictures of,
of dead Americans that are being killed.

137
00:07:22.671 --> 00:07:23.510
And,
you know,

138
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.860
I think there should be some level of transparency there when you should.

139
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.810
America should see what is happening,

140
00:07:29.811 --> 00:07:32.190
what is the cost because it's real easy for Americans to,

141
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.460
to sit there and allow these young kids to go overseas and fight and die and

142
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.180
would be wounded,
gravely wounded and just to shut those g,
you know,

143
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.040
just ignore him because I'm,
I don't care cause I'm over here in the mall.
No,

144
00:07:43.041 --> 00:07:45.590
maybe we should,
uh,
maybe we should not only,
you know,

145
00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:49.370
maybe we should not only show pictures of the coffins that are coming back,

146
00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:53.870
but maybe we should explore and show the lives that those men sacrificed and who

147
00:07:53.871 --> 00:07:57.320
they were and what they did and what their families are like and their wife and

148
00:07:57.321 --> 00:08:00.350
kids and mom and dad that they left behind that they gave up.

149
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.900
And why did they give it up?
Because they believed in freedom.

150
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.720
And so now we just going to say,
oh,
that's not happening.
No,

151
00:08:05.721 --> 00:08:09.590
it's happening and you need,
do you need to know it?
It is kind of strange,
right?

152
00:08:09.591 --> 00:08:12.770
When you think about how little access to information people really had back in

153
00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:15.170
world war two they were counting on the news and they were counting on

154
00:08:15.171 --> 00:08:17.690
newspapers and now today we have massive,

155
00:08:17.691 --> 00:08:20.480
massive access to information instantaneously.

156
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:24.310
But yet you get less of it when it comes to that.
Yeah.
And,

157
00:08:24.311 --> 00:08:25.520
and in some ways you get more of it.

158
00:08:25.521 --> 00:08:27.950
I mean obviously when there's an incident that happens overseas,

159
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.190
you can find out about it on Twitter as fast as you can find out about it

160
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:34.520
through,
you know,
waiting for a real new source to come up with it.

161
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:39.190
But you don't get anything that's like specifically distributed by the US

162
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:43.010
government to let you know the consequences of war and say,
Hey folks,

163
00:08:43.011 --> 00:08:44.960
we need your support.
This is what's really going down.

164
00:08:44.961 --> 00:08:48.410
These are American citizens and this is what's happening to the moment.
Yeah.

165
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.680
And then the same thing could be said for,
hey,

166
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:56.190
sometimes civilians are going to get killed and what do we do?

167
00:08:56.191 --> 00:08:57.000
What do we do then?

168
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.570
Do we brush that under the rug and we just show the Americans getting killed?

169
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:05.490
Or do you universally show what's happening?
What war is?
Men War is jacked up.

170
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:10.020
I'm here to tell you,
war is not glorious.
It is not fun.

171
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:14.700
And it is,
it is a horrible,
horrible event.
And so yeah,

172
00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:17.550
I think you should expose it and I think you should expose it at a,

173
00:09:17.551 --> 00:09:20.990
at a high level so that people understand what we're getting into.
And,

174
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.890
and as horrible as war is,

175
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:27.510
there's many times throughout history where war is the absolute in my mind,

176
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:31.060
in my opinion,
the right thing to do.
And we don't have a choice and,

177
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:35.100
and we need to do something when,
when horrible things are happening and,

178
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.790
and you know,
I think that's,
you know,
on my podcast I talk about like the,

179
00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:41.850
like I said,
I talk about war and death and horrible genocide and,

180
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:45.450
and that's one of the reasons why I think it's gotten a lot of traction is

181
00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:48.480
because I'm talking about things that other otherwise being ignored.

182
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.310
And I think people do want to know.

183
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:54.780
I think people do want to understand war to deeper level so that way when they

184
00:09:54.781 --> 00:09:57.960
hear a politician to up there saying,
hey,
we should go to war,

185
00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:59.340
they can at least save themselves.

186
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:03.270
I know what I know what he's talking about and he's not just talking about,
hey,

187
00:10:03.271 --> 00:10:05.610
we're going to wave the flag and we're going to send some soldiers over there

188
00:10:05.611 --> 00:10:07.770
going,
they're kick ass,
they're going to come home.
We're going to high five.

189
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:12.150
That's not what war is and let's not ever forget that.

190
00:10:12.151 --> 00:10:13.200
That's not what war is.

191
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:18.380
War is a man and another man on a battlefield surrounded by people,

192
00:10:18.931 --> 00:10:23.000
civilians,
and they're trying to kill each other and it's a bloodbath and we,

193
00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:27.300
we shouldn't forget that.
And is it necessary?
Sometimes?
It absolutely is.

194
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.640
It absolutely is necessary sometimes,

195
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:34.910
but we better way our our minds heavily before we make that decision to go and

196
00:10:34.921 --> 00:10:36.120
execute.
Now,

197
00:10:36.121 --> 00:10:39.630
when you think about the evolution of human beings and you think about how much

198
00:10:39.631 --> 00:10:42.840
safer it is today versus how it was thousands of years ago,

199
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.720
do you ever foresee a time where war won't exist?

200
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.480
I don't know.
You know,

201
00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:53.481
people joke with me a lot about the robot wars and and robots being able to

202
00:10:53.491 --> 00:10:56.580
accomplish wars.
I actually believe that thing will come.

203
00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.200
I mean we've got drones right now that,

204
00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:03.480
that are very capable and pretty soon we'll have land warfare robots that will

205
00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:06.510
be able to go in and clear buildings and make things happen.

206
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:11.370
And then we'll the enemy then have robots that will fight our robots at some

207
00:11:11.371 --> 00:11:12.630
point.
Yeah.

208
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.140
And then at some point will that elevate to a point where we're not dealing with

209
00:11:16.141 --> 00:11:17.040
physical robots anymore,

210
00:11:17.041 --> 00:11:21.270
but just the software behind the robots and now it's just a big sort of cyber

211
00:11:21.271 --> 00:11:25.410
warfare that that is.
That seems conceivable to me now.
Joe,

212
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:31.680
don't mistake me for some kind of like a Sam Harris in a lexical over here or

213
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.820
that I'm going to sit here and explain to you what the future of warfare from a

214
00:11:35.821 --> 00:11:37.860
technical perspective,
but from my,

215
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.890
from my rudimentary thought process,

216
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.920
could it not elevate to a point where we have robots fighting robots and then

217
00:11:43.921 --> 00:11:47.540
that eventually escalates to a point where it's some kind of cyber warfare with,

218
00:11:47.541 --> 00:11:49.560
it's not physical,
but it's just information based.

219
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:53.710
I that does make sense to me that that could happen.
Yeah,
it makes to me too,

220
00:11:53.711 --> 00:11:56.050
especially when you see those Boston dynamic robots,

221
00:11:56.051 --> 00:11:59.290
have you seen those guys are all things you kick them over,
they bounced back up,

222
00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:04.120
they run up hills,
they can run like 60 miles an hour.
They,
they're freaks.

223
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.570
I mean it's,
it's really,
and what they're doing now is just,
I mean,

224
00:12:07.571 --> 00:12:09.580
who knows where they're going to be 10 years from now?
I mean,

225
00:12:09.581 --> 00:12:13.480
they're going to be solar powered,
the bill bill live out there with no food.

226
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:17.970
Yeah,
it'll be awesome.
And then,
and then,
then where we go,
well,

227
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.780
those robots fight people for awhile.

228
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.030
Probably people that don't know anything about that.

229
00:12:22.031 --> 00:12:24.430
Don't the people that don't have good robots yet.
Yeah.

230
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.520
And that's not going to be fun for the people about robots.
Right.

231
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:31.120
And we'll see where it goes from there.
I mean,

232
00:12:31.121 --> 00:12:35.460
I think that's just a surrender scenario,
right?
If you got,
uh,
uh,
uh,
if,

233
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:40.590
let's say America has these robots that can just come in with ruthless precision

234
00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.810
and take out bad guys and you know,
you're going to be at their mercy,

235
00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.230
there's a fucking science fiction that would be right.

236
00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:57.340
<v 1>Okay.</v>
