1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
So it was a hundred pound cat is still going to be smaller than the dude that

2
00:00:03.541 --> 00:00:06.360
it's attacking.
Did you ever get in a fight with a house cat?
Never.
No.

3
00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:09.090
I've never gotten a fight with a house.
Can do all animals.
I am as well.

4
00:00:09.091 --> 00:00:13.230
But I had a feral cat.
I raised him.
They're all fucking fair.
And Joe?

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.640
No they're not.
All this is a cat and it was actually born in the wild.
Really?

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.530
Yeah.

7
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.530
He was born in the wild and I had a stay with him in a room to get myself used

8
00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:27.510
to him and get him used to me.
This is pre internet too,
by the way.

9
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.220
So this is like in the nineties and so I locked myself in a bedroom with this

10
00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:35.880
kitten and just brought a stack of books.
I put a mattress in there,

11
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.010
brought a stack of books,
just hung out with his cat.

12
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.760
And every time I'd get knee near this calf cow would freak out and hiss at me

13
00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:45.480
and jump on the curtains and fucking literally like climbed the blinds,

14
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.740
screaming and hissing.

15
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.770
And then I finally would get my hands on him and he would immediately start

16
00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:52.590
purring and given in because once he realized it wasn't trying to eat him,

17
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.700
that I was his friend,

18
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.690
I would pat him and he would per allowed an Auntie Kat would pro.
It was crazy.

19
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.580
Like I developed this bizarre bond with this cat because it's cat was so scared

20
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:06.660
of the world.
I mean he was that scared of every reaction every time.

21
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.580
No.
And eventually calm down and be like,
it was the only one that could,

22
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.040
that could touch him.
Now I was the only person,
like my friends would come over,

23
00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:17.010
he'd hiss at them.
He would like wow.
Like,

24
00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:20.430
like let them know like bitch shit is about to get really crazy.

25
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.970
Like I'm not a regular cat,
but I could go up to him and I could pet him.

26
00:01:23.971 --> 00:01:27.990
He was a feral cat,
you know?
Um,
what was my point?
Beginning this,

27
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.280
I dunno what,
what did we were,
oh,
okay.
Oh,

28
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.070
I had to get them fixed.
This is what it was the cat.

29
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.190
I had to get them fixed and I had to pick him up and I don't know how the fuck

30
00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:40.680
he knew that something was going on.
Oh that's right.

31
00:01:40.681 --> 00:01:42.450
Cause I was trying to get them in a laundry basket.

32
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.840
I was trying to put them in the lunch you basket because I wanted to bring him

33
00:01:45.841 --> 00:01:48.250
to the doctors,
get them singly buddy who tried,

34
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.550
who he trusts comes at him with a fucking cake.

35
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.420
Not that deep into our relationship either because he's the only like 10 or 11

36
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:56.670
months old.
He sees reign in my house,
man.

37
00:01:56.671 --> 00:02:00.930
He's lifting his tail up and just shoot and piss on my walls.
I was like,

38
00:02:00.931 --> 00:02:05.260
hey you fuck dude.
He pissed all over the place.
By the time I,

39
00:02:05.261 --> 00:02:08.820
I realized like I had to get him to a doctor.

40
00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:12.660
You pissed at my house like 10 times because they just piss in the house and so,

41
00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:15.090
and then I was worried like if you don't get them quick enough,

42
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.360
like you had to clean everything up deep,
clean all the carpets.

43
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.420
But if you don't get to him quick enough,
he just thinks,
well,

44
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:25.020
he's spraying from now on,
even after you fix something,
that can be a problem.

45
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.010
So I tried to hold onto him and put him in this laundry basket and to,

46
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.630
he taught me the fuck up.
He tore my arms up.

47
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.430
He just scratched me and Clyde me.
And he was remarkably strong.

48
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.220
This was a little cat.
And this was your friend,
like he,

49
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.160
when he was saying the same to me,
I thought you were my friend,
bitch.

50
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.310
I knew it.
You fucking prick.
So I had a $30 a blanket on him.

51
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.560
He was hissing at me and trying to get out of the room.

52
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.930
I had to throw a blanket at m and under the blanket.

53
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:57.600
I scooped him up and I put them in the laundry basket.

54
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.930
And then I slowly pulled the blanket out so he didn't suffocate while keeping

55
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:04.480
the lid down and then tape the,
the,
uh,

56
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:08.280
the laundry basket up so that I could put it in my car and he wouldn't jump out

57
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.760
my car and call my fucking face off while I'm driving.

58
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.190
[inaudible] Chevy chase movie.
Did you leave it at the vet and just walk away?

59
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.900
The vet was a good friend of mine who has since passed on and it was uh,
he was,

60
00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:21.710
uh,
a really,
uh,

61
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.990
he that guy loved animals eat the cat whisperer.
He know.

62
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:27.460
He knew how to take care of it.
He knew.

63
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:30.110
I told him the whole deal coming in and you know,

64
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.750
he knew he knew how to handle it.

65
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.340
He's the only vet I've ever had cry with me over what animal?

66
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.650
I had a puppy that had distemper.

67
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.820
A friend of mine found these puppies at a gas station.

68
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:46.250
Someone was giving them away and he took a bunch of them and he calls me up.

69
00:03:46.251 --> 00:03:49.180
He says,
Hey man,
you want a puppy there at the gas station?
I said,
yeah man,

70
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:52.750
bring that puppy over here.
Oh Man.
The puppy,

71
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:55.690
just after like a couple of days of being at the house,

72
00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:58.510
we'd have these seizures like violent seizures.

73
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.620
It would just lie down and eyes would roll back and you can just pet it a little

74
00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:05.770
bit.
It would slowly come back.
Then it would be weakened,
delirious,

75
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:07.060
and it would know it would happen.

76
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.810
And then towards the end it was having them all day long.

77
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.450
I mean it was just all day long.
And that's distemper,
distemper.

78
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.450
So how does it manifest?
Again,

79
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.590
it's just some horrible neurological disease that dogs get.

80
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.460
And if they don't get the right shots when they're young,

81
00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:27.610
they can get this and there's a bunch of different horrible reactions and it's

82
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.450
fatal.
So I had to take him to the vet and the vet was like,

83
00:04:31.451 --> 00:04:33.370
there's really nothing we could do with them.
He's having seat.

84
00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:38.200
He was having seizures all night,
all night.
It was awful.
And he was like,

85
00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:41.590
he's going to die and he,
you know,
any hour now,
you know,

86
00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:42.580
we're going to have to put them down.

87
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.660
So he puts him down and he comes out in the hallway.
I mean,
I,

88
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:49.630
I held the dog,
I placed him down,
I gave him a kiss,

89
00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:53.850
I said goodbye and he put the needle in the dog and,

90
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.860
and put the dog to sleep.
Then we both went outside,
man,
he was just crying,

91
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.440
just weeping.
You know the guys just the job.
Right.

92
00:05:02.441 --> 00:05:06.520
He just loved,
he felt loved animals when he had a ton of animals.
Man.

93
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.000
He had cats and dogs and all kinds of shit and um,

94
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.550
he was killed by a drunk driver that was,
yeah,

95
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.530
yeah,
yeah.
It was rough.
That was a,
that was a rough one.
I got an email,

96
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.210
I believe from his daughter.

97
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.050
It was a rough one.
The a super good dude,

98
00:05:29.051 --> 00:05:31.810
man.
The WHO,
who are you crying more for?

99
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:35.470
The guy or the dog because the d well you started with the dog though.

100
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.710
You started getting teary.
The dog was a bummer,
but it was,

101
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.650
it was more of a bummer.
Even the way he was approaching it,

102
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.600
just human.
He was approaching it very humanly like,
you know,
most doctors,

103
00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:49.100
I guess we're expected that they're like,
ah,

104
00:05:49.101 --> 00:05:50.900
I'm sorry at this person is best on it.

105
00:05:50.901 --> 00:05:54.130
Was that he wasn't on cal asked about it at all.
You know,
his,

106
00:05:54.131 --> 00:05:56.020
his feelings about where super raw.

107
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.160
That's what I would imagine I would be as a doctor

108
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.180
<v 1>just like,
I'm so pumped.</v>

109
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.580
<v 0>Good.
Sorry.
I do scare the fuck out of me with marriage.
In what way?</v>

110
00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.370
He would talk to me about his divorce and uh,
he would,
he would just,

111
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:10.910
he just grabbed me,
like,
grabbed me.
He goes,
don't you fucking get married?

112
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:15.890
Don't you ever do it was half joking,
half serious.
But he's like,

113
00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:17.990
trust me,
you don't want to do that.

114
00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:20.390
You don't want to have to go through this kind of a breakup.
He goes,
he goes,

115
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:22.580
you got a girlfriend right now.
You break up with her.
What happens?

116
00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:25.640
You get broken up.
That's it.
Get breakup.
And he goes,

117
00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:30.260
you don't have to see them in court every week for a year over and over again.

118
00:06:30.261 --> 00:06:33.830
Whether it's just trying to take money from you and lying about what you've done

119
00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:35.480
so they can get more money from you.

120
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.650
He went through a bad one and I believe some of his friends went through real

121
00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:44.300
bad ones too.
And it just,
he was one of those dudes and I was like,
you know,
26,

122
00:06:44.301 --> 00:06:48.590
27.
I was like,
Jesus,
man,
this is a man of science as a doctor.

123
00:06:48.591 --> 00:06:50.750
He knows what he's talking about.
You know,

124
00:06:50.751 --> 00:06:55.190
a wise man who knew a lot of shit.
So when he,
you know,

125
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.880
I was a moron.
So when he grabbed me,
let's listen.
Don't fucking get married.

126
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.140
You get married,
I got married.
He's just,
uh,
you know,

127
00:07:03.141 --> 00:07:05.900
he was just a guy that,
you know,
I mean,

128
00:07:05.901 --> 00:07:09.830
I really firmly believe when it comes to things like that,

129
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.520
there's this people that are just supposed to be doing what they're doing,
right.

130
00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.820
And he was a guy that was supposed to be working with the animals like it.

131
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.330
It just worked.
Man.
He had the heart for it.
He's a veterinarian.

132
00:07:20.331 --> 00:07:22.430
He probably seen how many animals die,

133
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.040
how many animals injured and still the guys crying.

134
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.830
A baby puppy has a baby dog.
Nobody wants to see a baby without a chance.

135
00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:33.080
So the dude's guard his heart in the right place.

136
00:07:33.081 --> 00:07:35.720
That's the guy you want to bring your animal to.
100%.

137
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:39.200
He's also the first guy that ever told me,
don't get my dog fixed.
Why?
Well,

138
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:42.950
he said,
look,
he goes,
don't let your dog have babies.
Don't be an asshole.
He goes,

139
00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:44.030
but if you get your dog fix,

140
00:07:44.031 --> 00:07:46.160
you've got to realize your dog's not going to have any testosterone anymore.

141
00:07:46.161 --> 00:07:48.710
It's going to be tired.
It's going to,
it's not going to be the same doc.

142
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.630
And I was like,
really?
And he's like,
yeah.

143
00:07:50.631 --> 00:07:52.980
And so of course I've got my dog faced and uh,

144
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.880
just would not fucking listen to this bed.
I got them fixed.

145
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:59.540
I was trying to calm him down.
He was a pit bull and he was very,
uh,
aggressive.

146
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:01.760
And when I went to it did calm him down,

147
00:08:01.761 --> 00:08:04.670
but immediately lost like most of his energy.
He didn't,

148
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.430
he just didn't have the same,
he's the same energy anymore.

149
00:08:07.431 --> 00:08:09.110
He was kind of like bummed out.
And it was weird,

150
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.870
<v 1>the yellow lab that I had,
or we had to like,
uh,</v>

151
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:16.600
when I first met Jennifer,
my wife,
uh,

152
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:22.240
she got pregnant shortly after we met.
Yeah.

153
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.960
That's how fucking viral,
I am.
Fearful like a,
like a cat.

154
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.230
So,
uh,
you know,
we,
we'd never,
like,
I'd never even owned a dog,
so I was like,

155
00:08:32.231 --> 00:08:34.420
we should get a dog to see if we'd be good parents.

156
00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:40.120
And so we went to the pet store in,
uh,
the Menlo Park Mall in New Jersey,

157
00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:43.270
and,
uh,
looked for a yellow lab she had in her head.
She's like,

158
00:08:43.271 --> 00:08:46.450
I had a yellow lab when I was a kid and they're the best dogs for children,

159
00:08:46.451 --> 00:08:49.570
so let's go get a yellow lab.
I'd never had a dog in my life.
So I was like,

160
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.860
that sounds great.
I knew what they look like.
So we went to the pet shop,

161
00:08:53.861 --> 00:08:58.260
try to find a yellow lab,
and we found this dog that was blonde leggy yellow lab.

162
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.850
And they were marketing it as a yellow lab,
but she'd been left behind.

163
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:06.270
All the other puppies had gone and she'd been there perhaps a little too long.

164
00:09:06.271 --> 00:09:11.180
Like,
you know,
she wasn't a dog yet,
but she was fucking on the,
you know,
uh,

165
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:15.570
w what was the Brittany Spears Song?
Um,
I'm not a girl,

166
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.690
not yet a womb.
And that's where the dog was.

167
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.070
She was too big for the fucking cage.
Like her face was pressed up against it.
No.

168
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.900
So we were like,
what about this dog?
And it was been priced down.

169
00:09:25.901 --> 00:09:30.180
He could see like 2000 marked all the way down to like 600 bucks.
And truly,

170
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:34.020
so we got that dog and you never seen it.

171
00:09:34.021 --> 00:09:38.250
Like it was like something out of a fucking cartoon because we were the ones

172
00:09:38.251 --> 00:09:38.581
that were like,

173
00:09:38.581 --> 00:09:41.700
get out of this cramped ass cage and come with us out into the parking lot.

174
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:47.410
It's dog instantly bonded with us,
loved us.
So fucking much became so needy.
Um,

175
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:51.240
we called it Scully.
We're big fans of the x files.
So,
uh,

176
00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:55.050
after a week of having that dog and the dog was a cup in our grill all the time,

177
00:09:55.051 --> 00:09:58.920
just like,
thank you.
Thank you for fucking getting me out of there.

178
00:09:58.921 --> 00:10:01.350
Like you are my people and Shit.
We were like,

179
00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:04.620
we should get another dog to babysit this dog.
So the dog has a friend.

180
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:08.850
So we went instead of to the pet store,
we went to a breeder's Kennel,

181
00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:11.520
like a pedigree place.
And,
uh,

182
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.960
they had puppies versions of fucking yellow labs and they were adorable,

183
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.380
like fucking 10 of them falling all over each other like an animated,

184
00:10:19.381 --> 00:10:23.700
like a Pixar movie.
And Jennifer picks up one and bonds with it.
She's like,

185
00:10:23.701 --> 00:10:26.220
this is the one,
let's get this one.
I went over to the counter and I was like,

186
00:10:26.221 --> 00:10:29.100
all right man,
we just bought a dog the week before,
600 bucks.

187
00:10:29.101 --> 00:10:32.490
And even then I was like 600 fucking bucks,
man.
They,
they,

188
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:35.340
they throw these things out,
you know,
we can get one for free and shit,

189
00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:39.310
but I was like,
I've never paid $600 for doc.
So you know,

190
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.580
I went up to the counter expecting,
well that's the rate,

191
00:10:41.581 --> 00:10:44.190
I guess the going rate for yellow lab,
600 bucks.

192
00:10:44.191 --> 00:10:46.260
So I went up to the counter and I was like,
we'll take that one.

193
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:51.030
And The lady's like,
that'll be $4,000 and it was like,
for all of them,

194
00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:53.880
I just want one.
And she's like,
these are pedigree dogs.

195
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.690
And I had just met Jennifer,
barely newer so I couldn't turn around and be like,

196
00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:01.830
put that down.
That's too expensive.
I tried to represent.
So I was just like,

197
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:06.480
well 4,000,
we're paying too low.
We are stealing from you.

198
00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:11.430
And we got that dog and to be fair,
we named him molder cause again x files,

199
00:11:11.431 --> 00:11:16.431
Fan Scully and Mulder and Scully was just like happy heart that just loved

200
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:22.140
molder was so smart and fucking thoughtful.

201
00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:26.010
He wrote my four best movies.
That's why he died.

202
00:11:26.011 --> 00:11:29.940
I made tusk and Yoga hosers like without that dog writing for me.

203
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.190
How do you write for you?
It's a joke Joe.

204
00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:36.120
He was funeral cause he's just saying he was so smart.

205
00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.970
He was so smart.
How smart woody,
he's so smart.

206
00:11:38.971 --> 00:11:43.320
He wrote my last few squares joke didn't quite land,
so I was missing something.

207
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:46.290
I wasn't paying attention.
I didn't set it up properly.
They're not a fucking pro.

208
00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.980
But in any event,
um,
he uh,
he was wonderful,

209
00:11:49.981 --> 00:11:54.981
but we got them clipped and his demeanor never really changed.

210
00:11:55.481 --> 00:11:56.870
He was always very low key.

211
00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.830
We called him Kilroy because he'd go to the other side of the bed and just look

212
00:11:59.831 --> 00:12:02.950
up like this.
Yeah,
I got my mastiffs snipped and it didn't really change.

213
00:12:02.951 --> 00:12:05.350
His personality stayed the same.
He stayed the same,

214
00:12:05.351 --> 00:12:09.010
but he was always kind of a mellow dog.
We got a very big dogs.

215
00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:12.340
I don't like to do too much.
We got a rescue last year,

216
00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:17.320
year and a half ago that was like,
you know,
molder died a couple of years ago.
Um,

217
00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:22.240
uh,
he was,
uh,
he made it to 15,
which is like fucking old,

218
00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:27.010
big for a big dog too.
Yeah,
it's pretty deep.
Like a doc,
I'll stick around,

219
00:12:27.011 --> 00:12:30.070
you know,
fucking like cancer,
but a fucking big dog like that.

220
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.260
Generally you don't make it past 10 11.

221
00:12:32.261 --> 00:12:33.850
So we've got a lot of good years out of him and stuff,

222
00:12:33.851 --> 00:12:38.530
but it was fucking horrible.
And I spent the last two years of scalies life,

223
00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.960
um,
almost as rehearsal for molder.
They're yellow lab.

224
00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:44.590
So what usually goes first is the hips and the back legs.

225
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:49.420
So scalies back legs when she just,
the rest of her body could work.

226
00:12:49.421 --> 00:12:52.480
But she was literally dragging your carcass.
What was wrong with their legs?

227
00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:56.200
They just went,
doctor was like,
this just happens.
They're done.
Wow.

228
00:12:56.201 --> 00:12:59.050
And she was 1213 so she'd made it a while,

229
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:02.380
but I was took the just stop working,
just give out.

230
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.710
So the nerves stop fire in the lake stop and there's no muscle.

231
00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:10.400
Yeah.
Wow.
So I put a scarf on to her.

232
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:15.070
The back end of her called the magic walking scarf and I would become the back

233
00:13:15.071 --> 00:13:17.630
legs for her.
So she would walk and I would be the back legs and you know,

234
00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:20.410
fucking get shit and piss all over and stuff.
But I'd Doug the dog,

235
00:13:20.411 --> 00:13:23.670
so it was no big deal.
So I did that all the way up to one scholar.

236
00:13:23.671 --> 00:13:28.480
He passed away and then molder was always very healthy and fucking mobile and

237
00:13:28.481 --> 00:13:30.550
loved walking and stuff.
Super Athletic Dog.

238
00:13:30.551 --> 00:13:32.830
Jen would take him up on Runyon Canyon and shit.

239
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:37.300
Then one day he had his back leg started dropping and your fucking heart sinks

240
00:13:37.301 --> 00:13:40.840
because you're like,
all right,
Scully.
She wasn't that active.

241
00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:43.030
So when she lost her legs,
like yeah,
it's a bummer.

242
00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:46.750
But she wasn't like the run around dog cause she used to chase moldy.

243
00:13:46.751 --> 00:13:50.360
You'd throw ball molder would run after and she would just chase molder and try

244
00:13:50.361 --> 00:13:53.380
to bite his back legs to prevent him from doing it because she wasn't nearly as

245
00:13:53.381 --> 00:13:57.340
fast molder was the go out guy.
He loved to fucking be active.

246
00:13:57.341 --> 00:13:58.450
So when his back legs,

247
00:13:58.451 --> 00:14:03.451
when it was like heartbreaking and then he stuck around for two more years.

248
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:08.260
So it was literally two years of me Walk Magic walking,
scarfing,
uh,

249
00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:09.650
this dog.
Uh,

250
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:13.840
then he got to the place where he did it.
You know,

251
00:14:13.841 --> 00:14:16.540
it wasn't just temper,
but when you were talking about it sounded so familiar,

252
00:14:16.541 --> 00:14:21.050
he would do that thing,
this thing where he would be like,
oh,

253
00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:25.210
and this would go on for fucking hours.

254
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:28.750
And you could tell it was exhausting for him and he couldn't fucking move.

255
00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:33.880
So you know,
everyone in the family was like,
it's time to let them go.

256
00:14:33.881 --> 00:14:36.370
And this was like when he first lost his legs,
but I was like,

257
00:14:36.371 --> 00:14:39.160
are you fucking shitting me?
If like if I lose my legs,

258
00:14:39.161 --> 00:14:43.000
you better fucking put a magic walkin scarf around my fat ass and not fucking

259
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:45.670
turned me over to the needle.
I like this is fucking family.

260
00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:51.630
So I held onto them for as long as I could until he got to that where he was

261
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:53.750
like an obvious fucking pain.

262
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:58.730
And I remember I shot a video of it on my phone.
I still have it and it's not,

263
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:02.400
you know,
it sounds fucking cruel or sick,
but like it was,

264
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.960
it was just a reminder because every once in a while I got new eventually.

265
00:15:05.961 --> 00:15:10.280
Like we would have to put him down and like it's such a weird relationship.

266
00:15:10.281 --> 00:15:13.240
Or one day you're like,
I love you to death and I love you so much,

267
00:15:13.241 --> 00:15:14.090
I have to fucking kill you.

268
00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:19.280
So I had that video on my phone for the longest time so that when in like the

269
00:15:19.281 --> 00:15:21.440
wee small hours of the morning,
I would wake up and be like,

270
00:15:21.441 --> 00:15:25.070
you killed your best fucking friend.
I could watch that video and be like,

271
00:15:25.071 --> 00:15:28.430
you had to,
he had like,
he wanted to go start was sick.

272
00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:33.620
So the doctor came over,
we got the vet to come over to the house and um,

273
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:36.200
it was like a big deal.
It was like we all knew it was coming and shit.

274
00:15:36.201 --> 00:15:41.180
I was flying home
from a Gig and I kept telling him like,

275
00:15:41.181 --> 00:15:43.790
Jennifer,
like,
don't do anything,
just like freeze.

276
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:48.680
Like I'll be there as quickly as possible.
And so like Doctor Kumar,

277
00:15:48.681 --> 00:15:52.040
who is our vet,
uh,
it was,
you know,
scheduled to come over and,

278
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:57.250
and that last fucking hour was probably hands down the most of my life,

279
00:15:58.431 --> 00:15:58.700
man,

280
00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:03.650
because we all knew what was coming and your program to s to stop that.

281
00:16:03.651 --> 00:16:07.130
It all costs program to keep people around and keep yourself around.

282
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:11.900
And yet like we were just all sitting there loving on them,

283
00:16:11.901 --> 00:16:14.630
knowing that like by the time Doctor Kumar gets here,
it's all done.

284
00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:15.700
It was fucking hard.

285
00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.280
It was artist thing in the world to do and he was still in pain the whole time.

286
00:16:19.281 --> 00:16:23.360
So even though you knew you were doing the right thing,
it was like,
like,

287
00:16:23.361 --> 00:16:27.500
I understand why that vet,
you know,
got emotional,
like,
yeah.
