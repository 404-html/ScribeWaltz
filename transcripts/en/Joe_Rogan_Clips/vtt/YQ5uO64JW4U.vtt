1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.240
I'll tell you this dude,
I tell you this,
I'm not being a hater.
I'm not being,
uh,

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.370
some sort of Debbie Downer.
I don't think it breaks.
2 million pay per view buys.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.010
You might be right.
I'm,
I'm not,
I'm not seeing it man.

4
00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:15.450
Like when Connor fought Florida Floyd or when Conor and Nate Diaz to,

5
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.690
I couldn't go anywhere without undue Starbucks unit anywhere shoe store where

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.140
car dealer,
everyone would,
dude,
Connor Floyd,
who you got man,

7
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.200
everybody in their mom now,
very rare.

8
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.120
Maybe I wanted my show someone to bring it up,

9
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.270
but there's something to Connor didn't want to do for this fight and that's

10
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:37.980
massive promotion.
So does that mean it's not as big?
Like who's that falling?

11
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:41.450
Is that Connor the you have Scott.
It's,
he doesn't want to do it.
Well,
the,

12
00:00:41.451 --> 00:00:44.640
the UFC has a model,
right?
And it worked in the Josie Aldo fight.

13
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.720
That model is you just promote the holy fuck out of a fight.

14
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.690
You travel the world,
you promote the shit out of it,

15
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.090
you scream at each other at press conferences,

16
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.430
you do all that stuff for months and months and months.

17
00:00:56.431 --> 00:01:00.060
And those things sell like crazy.
If it's Conor Mcgregor,
if it's Conor McGregor.

18
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.870
So who have they ever done it with besides Conor McGregor like that?

19
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.950
No one really sells like that.
They,
you know,
a little bit with Rhonda I guess,

20
00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:12.030
but she didn't have the same kind of chops as Connor.
Connor's the only one.

21
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.500
But you know,
I don't know.
Maybe it's cause he had a layoff,

22
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.820
maybe two after the Floyd thing.
I think it does.
Well,

23
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.770
I don't think it breaks a converse,
Nate too.
Well,

24
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.280
I don't think your breaks 1.6 minutes.

25
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:28.020
What I think happened was Connor made a hundred fucking million dollars and he

26
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:31.740
was like,
yeah,
I'm just going to train.
You know,
I think,

27
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.700
I think there's that.
And that also goes,
I'm not,

28
00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:39.390
that took so much energy to do all that and everyone knows me as that guy.

29
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.370
I have the toughest fight of my life coming up.

30
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.690
I'm taking every precaution necessary not to overtrain.
Yep.

31
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.370
Not to use all my energy.
This,

32
00:01:47.371 --> 00:01:49.680
I'm in the fight of my life and I'm going to train like it.

33
00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:50.910
I'm shutting down everything.

34
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.410
You can post the fucking me throwing the Dolly through the window 1000 times.

35
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.990
I'll do the press conference on Thursday.
Other than that,
man,

36
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.180
I have got to get ready for the fight of my life.

37
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.320
That's the way I'm looking at it.

38
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.110
I think you're right and I think this is the fight of his life.

39
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.680
I think stylistically it's a nightmare match up.

40
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.990
I think it's a nightmare matchup for both of them.
I think anyone who goes,

41
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.600
oh Connor,
you know he can't wrestle.
They can't do this.

42
00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:15.810
He's just going to get taken down and pounded out your show off.

43
00:02:15.811 --> 00:02:17.550
It's not even funny.
You don't know the game.

44
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.580
He absolutely is capable of stuffing a take down or two in the early going.

45
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.800
That's what's up because in the early going he's got that Stanger have a left

46
00:02:27.801 --> 00:02:31.020
hand and put his movement,
his footwork,
his footwork,

47
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.040
and Khabib is going to know that coming in.
He's going to be a little hesitant.

48
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.190
He's not going to walk towards him like Edson Barboza did or he didn't.

49
00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:42.180
The Edson Barboza fight.
You can't because Barboza is mostly kicks,

50
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.580
Barboza ties,
stock kicks,

51
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.320
lot of Thai style cakes and could be just put a tremendous amount of pressure on

52
00:02:49.321 --> 00:02:50.400
him and then got ahold of him,

53
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.460
but Connor is going to crack them with Hans and his footwork is way better.
He's,

54
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.130
he's just way better at moving in and moving out.
I think when people go,

55
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.520
either Connor starches him and gets the Kale or it could be just takes him down

56
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.910
for five rounds and pounds him out.
I think a,
I think it's a,

57
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:09.160
it's a classic fight.
I think it's back and forth.

58
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:12.550
I think if they fucking dog fight,
I think it's a fight of our lives,
man.
I,

59
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:14.770
I really do.
I think you probably right.

60
00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:18.100
I think you've got to think you're getting a fucking great fight from two guys

61
00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:21.040
where there's more on the line than just win or lose.

62
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.660
I think with Khabib and what he represents and talking to his team,
his team,

63
00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:28.720
Captain Josh Thompson,
he goes,
it could be,
he was going to retire after this.

64
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.510
Really?
He wants to beat Conor and retire.
Really?

65
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:36.511
You want to retire like the Floyd Mayweather of of MMA 27 and beat the beat the

66
00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:39.880
UFC,
you know poster boy and he's walks off in the sunset.

67
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.750
Unless they get him a super fight with GSP or some,
he's done.
Really?

68
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.640
Wow.
That's shocking.
He's young.
Very shocking.

69
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.100
But think how long he's been doing this since he's,

70
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:54.040
this whole has been fucking up grizzly bears.
So he's like,
all right,
I'm over it.

71
00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:57.520
This man and not dimension.
He lives with his family man.

72
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.300
He still lives his mom and dad,
his wife and his two kids.
Same House.
Wow.

73
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.970
That's kind of monster you're dealing with.
And then for Connor,

74
00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:08.971
I think it's a legacy fight where you know he's coming off the Floyd Mayweather

75
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:13.060
kind of trained.
There were,
it was a success.
Either way.
You look at it,

76
00:04:13.061 --> 00:04:14.500
he made $100 million.

77
00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:17.380
They compete against the best of all time and lasted more rounds.

78
00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:21.570
Anyone thought and trained for a complete boxing match?
It was striking to me.

79
00:04:21.571 --> 00:04:25.060
You better go in this fight.
But for him it's not about the money.
You see him,

80
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.550
the one interview he's done on Mac life,

81
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.170
you can see it's like it's a vintage common.
We go,
Oh shit,
we got one here man.

82
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.700
This isn't,
you know the Floyd Mayweather is more of a show like,
you know,

83
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.230
we didn't think he was gonna win that.
This one.
He looked at it.
Oh Shit.

84
00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:39.160
That's vintage Connor.

85
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.160
This mother fuckers coming to fight and he might get taken down.
Yes,

86
00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:45.160
I guarantee you he gets taken down that motherfuckers can get back up.

87
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:46.630
He's going to get up and he's like,

88
00:04:46.631 --> 00:04:49.570
keep getting up and could used and keep coming and we got a dog fight,
man.

89
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.960
I think both guys going be fucked up after this fight.
And to me a classic,

90
00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.450
it could be or asked for two fucking just could be good starts in seven seconds.

91
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.280
People are leaving.
It's on a loop.

92
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.530
That could bebes got to get through the fire.
You know,

93
00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:07.630
he's got to get through the fire in the early going.

94
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.280
He's got to close that distance and he's got to do it with precision without

95
00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:14.380
letting those nerves affect him.
Right?
I mean,

96
00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:17.050
he's got all his shit talking con has done to him.

97
00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:19.060
He seen him rattled at the press conference.

98
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.490
He's rattled when he started talking about his dad.
He's rattled.
And I think,
um,

99
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.380
we've,
we've also never seen Khabib fight with high stakes,
right?

100
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.680
Like when he fought Alec went to,
that was in high stakes.
AL's amazing fighter.

101
00:05:29.681 --> 00:05:33.600
But that's not the same as fighting Conor McGregor when he's fighting a Edson

102
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.010
Barboza that's not in high stakes when you're fighting Conor Mcgregor,

103
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.850
Conor takes all the chips on that poker table,
puts it all in the mill goes,

104
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:43.900
I'm all in.
You have to be all in.
I do.
Well under these circumstances.

105
00:05:43.901 --> 00:05:48.900
How do you respond?
Yeah.
So for women,
I've seen Khabib and everyone goes,
oh,
it's,

106
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.530
cardio is great.
It is great.

107
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.860
But when the fucking Irish nation is rock in that fucking arena and there's all

108
00:05:57.411 --> 00:06:00.500
this pressure,
his heart rate's going to go up and easy.
My God,

109
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:03.200
I fucking hate this guy because he's never followed a guy who hates,

110
00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:08.060
he hates con.
Yup.
How is he going to be over zealous and open himself up?
Yep.

111
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:09.370
There has to be something there.
And we like,

112
00:06:09.371 --> 00:06:13.170
we don't know exactly what all was an assassin until that fight complete.

113
00:06:13.171 --> 00:06:16.340
Forget the best of all time.
Yeah.
Still is.
But that,

114
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.370
that fight exposed how good Connor psychological game is because months and

115
00:06:22.551 --> 00:06:24.110
months of being on tour with Conor,

116
00:06:24.111 --> 00:06:27.170
those press conferences kind of stealing his belt and screaming at them and

117
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.070
getting in his face and then starches him with one punch.
Oh,
amazing.

118
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.640
But the what?
The what,

119
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.990
what else is interesting is remember Connors and amazing counter puncher,

120
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.070
well to be an amazing counter puncher and he needed to guide a punch at you can

121
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.140
be,
is not going to punch at them.
Right.

122
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:46.250
Unless it becomes an ego thing like you did with uh,
al or Edson Barboza.

123
00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:49.520
We just walked him down.
There's no respect.
He might throw some punches.

124
00:06:49.521 --> 00:06:52.730
So it's mansion for Connor to find those angles when a guy's not playing the

125
00:06:52.731 --> 00:06:54.290
game,
who it's also could be,

126
00:06:54.291 --> 00:06:58.760
was that a history of struggling to make weight that he cannot struggle to make

127
00:06:58.761 --> 00:07:00.530
weight for this fight.
He's gotta be on point.

128
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.400
He came in that press conference at one 74 they said this motherfucker started

129
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:08.300
camp at one 80 something like he's,
he's never been more serious.
Where a fight,

130
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.420
which for people listening,
if you're saying like,

131
00:07:11.421 --> 00:07:15.710
well buddy fights at one 55 he used to weight 200 200 no.
Yeah,
yeah.

132
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.140
And then get down to one 55 and it was not good.

133
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.290
I mean the Michael Johnson fight,
he struggled.

134
00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:24.260
He had like some real shutdown issues and then the Tony Ferguson fight,

135
00:07:24.261 --> 00:07:25.490
they pulled him out of the fight.

136
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:29.850
He can't have any of that nonsense this weekend.
Oh No.
I don't think the,
the,

137
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.990
the nonsense,
the only thing where like Jamie,
me is going to the fight.

138
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.540
I would never go to this fight.
I think there's what?

139
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.870
I would not go this fight for this reason.
I'm a complete pussy.

140
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.310
I think something's going to happen.

141
00:07:40.311 --> 00:07:42.410
The crowd between the Russians and the Irish,

142
00:07:42.411 --> 00:07:45.290
I think that it's just the animosity between the two.

143
00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:48.890
They hate each other so bad.
If this fight,
it happens for Conor,

144
00:07:48.891 --> 00:07:51.290
you're going to have upset Russians.
That happens for Khabib.
Me,

145
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.210
I've upset fucking Irish.
I think it's good.

146
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:58.850
It's gotten bigger than just a UFC fight.
Really?
I do,
man.

147
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.260
So hostile.

148
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:03.800
You think you wouldn't go to this fight because of the potential the violence

149
00:08:03.801 --> 00:08:07.130
breaks out?
Correct.
I also don't like going to UFC fights.

150
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.680
I also don't like you're going to UFC fights.
Why don't you like it?

151
00:08:09.681 --> 00:08:12.830
Because he used to fight.
It's just stressful for me.
I just,
yeah,

152
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:13.700
just super stressful.

153
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:16.330
If you feel like you're gonna fight again when your daddy get the nerves and I'm

154
00:08:16.331 --> 00:08:19.310
just like,
oh,
I go complete opposite of that now.

155
00:08:19.311 --> 00:08:22.640
I try to get more relaxed when you know when I'm doing standup,
I go,

156
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:26.390
I don't want to be in that scared mode anymore.
Yeah.
That's interesting.

157
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:31.010
My heart rate under sweating the whole time.
I'm just like around like sweating.

158
00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:35.840
I looked like,
shit,
pull up that card.
Let me see the rest of the car,
dude.

159
00:08:35.841 --> 00:08:39.950
If you're Tony Ferguson,
it's like,
oh yeah,
and Tony's fighting.
Right?
I know.

160
00:08:39.951 --> 00:08:43.730
And he's fighting pedis.
It's not an easy fight for comeback fight,
Tony.
I mean,

161
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:48.110
I'm just amazed that he's able to fight again so quickly after knee surgery.

162
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.820
You don't,
what's interesting to me is I asked Josh Thompson,

163
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.530
who knows could be you and I'll see you can talk to DC about it,
but they,
I go,

164
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.800
dude,
Tony's back like if could be where to win.
Huge fight.
Tony Ryan.
He goes,

165
00:08:58.801 --> 00:09:01.400
no interest.
That's fight does nothing to him mentally.

166
00:09:01.401 --> 00:09:04.200
He just doesn't care about it.
I'm like,
it could be just doesn't care.
Yeah.

167
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.130
He's like not with Tony,
so he really just wants to fight Conor and then get out,

168
00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:11.820
get out one store.
What's the Tsp from?
From this room?
Josh Thompson.

169
00:09:11.821 --> 00:09:15.570
His mouth from Khabib.
He wants to beat the UFC is poster boy.

170
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.040
Dana's poster boy and walk the fuck out and last they give him a super fight.

171
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.760
Who the fuck has ever been?
26 and as a champion,

172
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.740
I think that's the only one.
Yeah.
But 26 and,
oh,
for sure.
He's fucking,

173
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:32.190
who else has been undefeated?
Champion undefeated champion.

174
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:37.140
Conor was on a Jon Jones fight.
Matt Hamill before he won the title.

175
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.320
He fought Matt Ham on the ultimate fighter.
Roy Nelson,
Bro.
No,
no.

176
00:09:40.321 --> 00:09:41.910
It wasn't the ultimate fighter.

177
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:45.440
That was ultimate fighter finale because I fought Roy Nelson.
Jon Jones.

178
00:09:45.441 --> 00:09:48.100
Flat Matte.
Right.
Not on the,
not on the ultimate photo.
You don't,

179
00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:53.070
when they do the financial.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Um,
that's a bullshit laws though.

180
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.210
Oh my God.
You got to loss from whooping a dude's ass so bad.

181
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:01.740
Um,
as far as unfair champions who,

182
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:08.490
I don't think there's one Hennen brow.
Oh,
he won,

183
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.690
but he lost his first fight.
Yeah.
Cannonborough losses the first under.
No,

184
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:15.480
he was like,
he had like 30 wins in a row or some shit,

185
00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:18.570
but had a weird loss back in Brazil.
Yeah.
He lost his first MMA fight,

186
00:10:18.571 --> 00:10:19.500
rather Rhonda.

187
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:21.340
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

188
00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:24.460
<v 0>Yeah.
Ron Brown was undefeated.
Undefeated.
Yup.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

189
00:10:24.461 --> 00:10:26.130
Rhonda is only two losses were the,

190
00:10:26.131 --> 00:10:30.460
the two title fights between Holly and Amanda.
Let's see,
what do you got there,

191
00:10:30.461 --> 00:10:34.650
Jamie?
What are you pulling up?
List of undefeated MMA champions.

192
00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:39.850
Ben Asca and hanging around Ben aspirins for sure.
One of them put Ben,

193
00:10:39.851 --> 00:10:42.720
ask her to me and I've had him on the podcast.
I've said this line.

194
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.040
I love the guy.
He's my all Brian Ortega.

195
00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.370
But Brian or take isn't really a champion.
Well these aren't champions.
Are they?

196
00:10:48.371 --> 00:10:51.800
These just you undefeated MMA fighters.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Right.

197
00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:54.290
These aren't champions.
Yes.
Uh,

198
00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:58.150
Ben's the one guy who I'd love to see come out of retirement and fight.
Could be,

199
00:10:58.450 --> 00:10:59.171
he's the one guy.

200
00:10:59.171 --> 00:11:02.380
That's my biggest disappointment that that guy never fought in the UFC.

201
00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.920
It's a fucking shame.
And,
but the thing is like,
Khabib wouldn't find my,

202
00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.190
nobody knows who he is outside of the hardcore guys.

203
00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:12.840
Why would you fight fun and maybe lose,
maybe get out wrestled it.

204
00:11:12.841 --> 00:11:17.350
Here's the only if,
if you're going to say something about,
could be bs 27.
Oh,

205
00:11:17.351 --> 00:11:18.184
he really,

206
00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.310
when you look at the body of work from Connor compared to Khabib assignment,

207
00:11:21.311 --> 00:11:24.470
close the,
the winds that Connor has,
her remarkable.
Yes.

208
00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.190
You look at the Max Holloway,
Chad Mendez,
Josie Aldo,

209
00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:31.370
what he did to Eddie Alvarez,
I mean,
ridiculous,
ridiculous,
ridiculous.
Yeah.

210
00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.350
Then Nate Diaz,
when they do have loss,
like you just look at the,

211
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.010
the caliber of opponents that he's faced from a very young age.
It's a nightmare.

212
00:11:39.011 --> 00:11:41.380
And they look at Khabib,
he's 27.
No,

213
00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.850
his biggest ones probably Barboza does Sanchez when he was a little weathered,

214
00:11:45.851 --> 00:11:50.590
but yeah,
no,
but Barboza in the,
as a perfect stylistic matchup for him.

215
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.750
So yeah,
we,
we,
we don't with Coby,
we know he's damn good,
but how good.

216
00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:00.490
He's had one weird moment in his entire career,
the skin,
Michael Johnson,

217
00:12:00.491 --> 00:12:01.810
when Michael Johnson cracked him,

218
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:06.280
wobbled him for a second and then took them down and smashed up Gleason,
uh,

219
00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:10.290
[inaudible] Tibau fight got a little dicey to it.
Yeah.
Paul,

220
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:14.200
I don't remember that fight at all.
Um,
but,
but with,
with Michael Johnson,

221
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:18.610
it's funny to me because Michael Johnson landed that big overhand and MPP.

222
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.870
People go,
oh,
[inaudible] has a weak chin.
I'm like,
well,
he's never been dropped.

223
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.600
He's never been,
he's never been,

224
00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:28.180
sounded that and starched Dustin Poirier with one punch.

225
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:29.740
Don't forget about that.

226
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:34.320
Michael Johnson can fucking punch and he's explosive is shit.
I mean he caught,

227
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:38.530
could be,
it could be got Waa rock for a second and then weathered the storm.

228
00:12:38.531 --> 00:12:42.700
Took them down,
smashed him.
It was a total dominant performance.
Yeah.

229
00:12:42.701 --> 00:12:45.760
If you look at his performance,
like you look at his rather his resume.

230
00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:50.350
Pat Healey was a tough fighter that,
that,
that showed,

231
00:12:50.351 --> 00:12:53.000
able to heal.
He smashed able.
True Healer.
I remember Abel,

232
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:56.620
he took down more times.
Anyone inside that octagon 21 towns,
right time to thing.

233
00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:01.800
And he was a college wrestler and a strong guy able strong as shit.

234
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.240
And that's Gleason.
Uhh,
Tibau one is that 2012 that's [inaudible].

235
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:11.080
That's the juicy,
yeah.
The real big fight was the Barboza fight.

236
00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:15.850
And then ally Quinta was,
I mean,
as,
as as last minute as last minute gets,

237
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.330
and he still went five whole rounds with I Quinta,

238
00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:22.120
which was interesting for a lot of people.

239
00:13:22.121 --> 00:13:26.290
Like I talked to Eddie Alverez after that fight and he was like very
interesting.

240
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:28.570
Very interesting.
Yeah.
I was like,

241
00:13:28.571 --> 00:13:31.420
this is why you saw a lot of things in that fight,
honey.
He's like,
yeah,

242
00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.640
he's like a,
you know,
once the,

243
00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.850
once the fight got into the later rounds and he's still standing up with guys,

244
00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:38.630
he let go.
Whoa.
All right.

245
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:41.590
It's so interesting to me because when you talked to anyone from AK off,
see,

246
00:13:41.591 --> 00:13:43.510
they're super pro could be,
but they're like,
dude,

247
00:13:43.511 --> 00:13:45.900
this isn't even a fight like this.
What do you,

248
00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.680
this is one of Khabib's easier fights.

249
00:13:47.681 --> 00:13:50.830
He's definitely had way tougher match ups and like,
you're crazy,
man.

250
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.830
They're like,
you should see,
could go against Ed Ruth,

251
00:13:53.831 --> 00:13:57.850
who's an all American Penn state wrestling.
He fucks him up.
He takes him down.

252
00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:02.830
I'm like,
what?
But that's,
you know,
that's,
that's that wrestling,
you know,

253
00:14:02.831 --> 00:14:06.100
that dance,
that rhythm.
Connor's not on that rhythm.

254
00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:07.780
You're talking about a different animal.

255
00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:12.070
You talking about a guy who is one of the best fencers in the game,

256
00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:17.250
meaning can like jump in with one shot and put you out and he can do it moving

257
00:14:18.221 --> 00:14:22.570
back.
He could do it moving forward.
He can time you and he'll,

258
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:26.860
he'll be very common there.
You will get the very best.
Conor McGregor,

259
00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.750
he's also no slouch on the ground.

260
00:14:28.751 --> 00:14:31.840
People think he's just going to get taken down and like get crucifix right away.

261
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:34.590
You're out.
Your goddamn mind got trains with Dylan.
Dan as he,

262
00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:37.630
he's brought in these,
uh,
Dagestani wrestlers.

263
00:14:37.631 --> 00:14:40.820
Like he's training with the lead of the lead.
He's,
he's,
you know,

264
00:14:40.821 --> 00:14:42.490
what could be going to do.
Yeah.

265
00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.950
It's way easy to train for Khabib than it is Connor.
