Hello Freak bitches.
What is the argument about the Sphinx?
The enclosure,

2
00:00:05.491 --> 00:00:09.270
this banks and doctor Robert Schoch from Boston University who's a geologist.

3
00:00:09.271 --> 00:00:10.320
What was his conclusion?

4
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.420
What shock is saying is that the Sphinx and the trench out of which the Sphinx

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.580
is cut a bas,

6
00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:21.180
the unmistakable evidence of precipitation induced weathering,

7
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.230
weathering caused by exposure to a substantial period of heavy rainfall.

8
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.840
And that is particularly pointed out in the vertical fissures in the trench.

9
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.120
They see the Sphinx itself has been subject to so much restoration over so many

10
00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:36.600
years that is difficult for people to even see the core body of the Sphinx
today.

11
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.100
Uh,
but it's these,

12
00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:41.250
you can see the vertical fissures even down at the back of there.
That is,

13
00:00:41.251 --> 00:00:44.850
that is what shock counts as rainfall,
precipitation induced weathering,

14
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:45.960
heavy rainfall,

15
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.370
which is selectively removing the softer layers and leaving the harder layers in

16
00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:51.120
place.

17
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.100
And the problem is we don't have that rainfall in Giza in Egypt four and a half

18
00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:56.881
thousand years ago.

19
00:00:56.881 --> 00:01:01.470
You have to go back much earlier to get that rainfall as the suggestion.

20
00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:04.730
So that's the suggestion by Robert Schoch independently.
Yes.

21
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.800
If your conclusion is a delay independently.
Yeah,

22
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.190
shock disagrees with me on many things as,
as a matter of fact.
Uh,
and,

23
00:01:11.191 --> 00:01:14.210
and I disagree with him on many things,
but I think he's on the money on this.

24
00:01:14.211 --> 00:01:17.010
So that alone would set back at least that one.

25
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.010
I mean it's pretty much established that the Great Pyramid of Giza was

26
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:22.330
constructed about 2,500 BC.
Right.

27
00:01:22.331 --> 00:01:26.190
Is absolutely no doubt that a huge project went on at Giza around 2,500.

28
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.750
So you are getting involved appear not that the whole thing was that much older

29
00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:35.520
was that parts of it seem to have been from an earlier civilization or at least

30
00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:40.440
that civilization far,
far earlier than I was.
I would say that the ground plan,

31
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.790
what we have at Giza,

32
00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:45.630
the basic layout of the site was established in what the ancient Egyptians

33
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:49.170
called Zep Tepi the first time.
Uh,
astronomically.

34
00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:54.030
And geologically I and my colleagues suggest that the first time can be dated to

35
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:58.550
the period of about 12 and a half to 13,000 years ago.
That,

36
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.140
that that was when the site was laid out.

37
00:02:00.141 --> 00:02:03.630
Cause there's intriguing astronomical alignments of the Great Pyramids to the

38
00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:04.290
belt of Orion.

39
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.880
I know ed crop has a completely opposite view on this and have the greatest

40
00:02:07.881 --> 00:02:11.130
things to the constellation of Leo rising due East housing,

41
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:14.790
the sun on the equinox,
the astrological age of Leo.
Again,

42
00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:19.170
I have slides I can align with the geological evidence that Robert Schoch

43
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.320
[inaudible] with the geological evidence,

44
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.980
years or age of Leo pretty much exactly spans the younger dryas as matter of

45
00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:26.160
fact.

46
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.730
And so the only argument against that at the time was that there were no other

47
00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:33.930
structures like that from 12,000 years.
Correct.
And then crop said that the,

48
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.670
that the Orion correlation wasn't real.
Uh,
because it was upside down.

49
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.930
I'm a do you want to get into that now?

50
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.340
<v 1>Well,
the first,
um,
that's not the only argument.
It's that,
okay.</v>

51
00:02:43.341 --> 00:02:48.030
If the Sphinx is built or the layout for the whole thing is built in,
uh,

52
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.920
you know,
say 10,
11,000 years ago and then the,
and then the pyramids are built,

53
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.840
you know,
2,500 BC w w what happened in between where all the people,

54
00:02:56.841 --> 00:03:00.010
the trash,
the places where they lived?
Well,
there's a bunch different styles of

55
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.790
<v 0>construction but not dated in between.
I would propose Michael,</v>

56
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:04.930
something like a monastery,

57
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.670
which has a relatively small archeological footprint is on the side.

58
00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:11.710
I mean the idea of information,

59
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:15.520
knowledge and traditions lasting for thousands of years within a religious

60
00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:18.500
system shouldn't be too absurd to us.
I mean Judaism is,
is,

61
00:03:18.501 --> 00:03:21.790
is dealing with ideas that are already best part of 4,000 years old if we go

62
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:23.830
back to or have the child is and so on and so forth.

63
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:27.220
So that's all I'm suggesting really that,
that the idea is preserved,

64
00:03:27.221 --> 00:03:31.060
maintained that the,
the survivors,
the survey on the site,

65
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.190
but on something like a monastery,
which is,

66
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:37.390
which has got a very small archeological footprint,
it is not high.
Perhaps again,

67
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:40.570
one can only speculate and I think there's a lot of speculation on the

68
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:43.990
archeological side to one can only speculate perhaps having gone through a

69
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:48.040
cataclysm,
perhaps they felt to blame for this wrongly or rightly.

70
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.120
I mean there are many,

71
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:53.320
many traditions in which humanity's behavior is implicated in the cataclysm that

72
00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:57.940
takes place and perhaps they didn't want to switch civilization on completely

73
00:03:57.941 --> 00:03:58.391
right there.

74
00:03:58.391 --> 00:04:02.320
Perhaps they perhaps they waited pass down the knowledge through initiates

75
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.180
enough was there to create a mystery because it's undoubtedly a mystery that the

76
00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:09.040
construction of the Great Pyramids,

77
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.960
the first huge pyramids in Egypt proceeded only really by the Xhosa pyramid at

78
00:04:13.961 --> 00:04:14.794
Saqqara.

79
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.810
The construction of the Great Pyramids is vastly superior to the construction of

80
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:22.930
the Pyramids of the fifth and sixth dynasty that follow it.

81
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:26.130
And that's a little bit counter intuitive that we have this collapse in skills.

82
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.640
One would have expected it to get better.

83
00:04:27.641 --> 00:04:31.750
So it sounds like the work on the pyramids started already with a level of

84
00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:32.584
knowledge in hand.

85
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.530
<v 1>Yes.
But okay,
so here's,
here's how I would think about that.</v>

86
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.600
There's a lot of perhaps seen and maybe because yes.
Well,

87
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.840
so you have a bunch of Egyptologists and archeologists who have been working on

88
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.620
this site for centuries.

89
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.250
This is one of the most ancient mysteries and so on and so say,

90
00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:55.270
let's say there's like 20 lines of evidence that point to build roughly around

91
00:04:55.271 --> 00:04:58.360
this time period here,
and then you come on and say,
okay,

92
00:04:58.361 --> 00:05:02.710
but there's this one anomaly of the rain thing that there was only rain at this

93
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:07.450
time.
Now there's a huge gap.
You have one anomaly or line of evidence here,

94
00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:10.030
and like 20 here we're talking about different structures,

95
00:05:10.031 --> 00:05:12.940
so there's not a lot of evidence of points of the Sphinx being from a particular

96
00:05:12.941 --> 00:05:15.700
time period.
Well,
he's saying like 12,000 right?

97
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.420
<v 0>I'm saying the rainfall evidence suggests that by other evidence that alignment,</v>

98
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.210
it's alignment with the Constellation of Leo Housing,
The Sun,

99
00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:24.820
right at dawn on the spring equinox.
It's an equinox.
Your market.

100
00:05:24.821 --> 00:05:28.420
Nobody would dispute that.
Nobody would dispute that.
The ancient digit.
Well,
no,

101
00:05:28.421 --> 00:05:30.610
I mean,
if you make a monument pointing perfectly joyous,

102
00:05:30.611 --> 00:05:33.790
I've stood on the back of the Sphinx at dawn on the spring equinox,

103
00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:36.070
and believe me,
I,
again,
I could show a picture.

104
00:05:36.071 --> 00:05:39.220
It's headlines up perfectly with the rising sun,
but no,

105
00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:42.540
I don't think anybody even crop is disputing that.
It's an exponential market.

106
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.880
Now,
here's the thing,
you're an ancient Egyptian.
You're building an equinox,

107
00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:49.750
your marker in 2,500 BC.
Do you know what constellation is?

108
00:05:49.751 --> 00:05:53.260
Housing the son in 2,500 BC.
I haven't run the little program,

109
00:05:53.261 --> 00:05:57.340
and it's the constellation of Taurus.
So logically,
if you're creating an equinox,

110
00:05:57.341 --> 00:06:00.650
IOM and the ancient Egyptians were not shy about making images of balls,

111
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.450
plenty of them.
If you're making an equinox your marker in 2,500 BC,

112
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:09.740
we should create it in the form of a bull,
not in the form of a lion.
You know,

113
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.900
that's the,
that's the puzzling issue.

114
00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:14.600
And yet we do have a time when a lion constellation,

115
00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:17.150
how's The sun at dawn on the spring equinox?

116
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:19.460
And that is the period of the younger dryas.
Okay.

117
00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:22.070
I'd say that's a pretty big leap.
I know you'd say that.

118
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:23.770
And your colleagues will say that too.
There.

119
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.080
<v 1>And then we have a gap of about five or 6,000 years where there's nothing.</v>

120
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.620
There's no,
yeah.

121
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.190
Please do refer back to several articles that were published in the eighties and

122
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.980
nineties.
This one is from,
uh,
from nature early eighties,

123
00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:41.300
late quarternary history of the Nile and what it's discussing is the evidence

124
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:45.890
that there was a major shift in the,
in the hydraulic regime of the Nile River.

125
00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.970
Um,

126
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.950
it says between 20,000 and 12,000 years before present when timberline into

127
00:06:51.951 --> 00:06:56.360
headwaters was lower vegetation cover more open than today.

128
00:06:56.361 --> 00:06:59.360
The Nile was a highly seasonal,
braided river,

129
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.980
which brought mixed course and fine sediments down to Egypt and Sudan.

130
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.100
This cold,
dry interval had answered,

131
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:12.220
ended by 12,500 years before present when overflow from Lake Victoria and higher

132
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:19.270
rainfall in Ethiopia sent extraordinary floods down the Mayo main aisle.

133
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:25.570
And those floods had been documented to have been 120 feet above the modern

134
00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:30.290
flood plain of denial.
Any civilization or whatever you want to call it,

135
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:35.650
living along denial river at that time would have had to abandon whatever they

136
00:07:36.381 --> 00:07:38.900
were doing there.
In the industry regime,

137
00:07:38.901 --> 00:07:41.870
there's intensified hydraulic regime and it says,

138
00:07:41.871 --> 00:07:46.850
it goes on to say it marked a revolutionary change to continuous flow with a

139
00:07:46.851 --> 00:07:48.410
superimposed flood peak.

140
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:52.580
So what happened is that there was a major environmental change that occurred

141
00:07:52.581 --> 00:07:55.880
right there around 12,000 to 12,000,
500 years.

142
00:07:55.881 --> 00:07:59.720
The dating could be adjusted somewhat,
uh,
since the early eighties.

143
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:04.700
But the point is made is that because of a major hydrological change,

144
00:08:04.701 --> 00:08:08.150
major vegetational cover change,
major environmental change,

145
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:13.480
this would have caused also imposed changes upon whatever culture was existing

146
00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:16.640
air or living near at the time.
Now,

147
00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:20.870
what we have is in the aftermath of that event,

148
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.720
we have basically the emergence of desert,

149
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:28.780
which now would require serious adaptation.
Um,

150
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.270
it's very likely to that these events,
uh,

151
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:37.180
could have also decimated the population at the time,
leaving,
um,

152
00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.140
basically no workforce.

153
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:44.150
And then over a period of two or three or 4,000 years,
you find that,

154
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:48.890
that there's enough of a recovery that these kinds of monumental structures can

155
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.690
be renewed.
Um,

156
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.350
but it's clear from this and a lot of other studies studies in the eastern

157
00:08:54.351 --> 00:08:59.100
Mediterranean that there were SAP repel layers,
um,
which is caused,

158
00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:04.101
which is basically material that has been washed in from the continental surface

159
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.750
that has not oxidized.

160
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:11.670
It is essentially become rotten and carried in organic material,

161
00:09:11.671 --> 00:09:16.170
carried in off of the continents by this enhanced regime of,

162
00:09:16.171 --> 00:09:21.171
of waterflow actually forcing so much water that there was a freshwater lid on

163
00:09:22.201 --> 00:09:27.150
the eastern Mediterranean that,
uh,
caused a cessation in the,

164
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:28.410
um,
the,
the,

165
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.800
the circulation between the upper waters and the lower waters reducing the

166
00:09:34.021 --> 00:09:36.900
amount of oxygen brought down to the,
to the lower waters.

167
00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:40.290
And so you had these layers of mud that formed on the bottom of the

168
00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:45.291
Mediterranean that show this massive influx of fresh water flowing off of,

169
00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:50.340
out of the Nile and off of the,
the Egyptian continent at the same time.

170
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:55.350
So clearly the evidence shows that there were major climatic changes that

171
00:09:55.351 --> 00:09:56.910
occurred around this time.

172
00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:02.640
It is not so speculative to to imagine that whoever,

173
00:10:02.641 --> 00:10:07.500
whatever,
and we don't have to invoke any kind of a super advanced civilization,

174
00:10:07.501 --> 00:10:11.910
but whatever cultures were there that were perhaps capable of carving blocks of

175
00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:15.200
stone transporting blocks of stone as they were at go back,

176
00:10:15.201 --> 00:10:19.140
Lee Tapi during this time range would have been that,
that their,

177
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:22.920
that their activity would have been interrupted to the extent that it might have

178
00:10:22.921 --> 00:10:26.280
taken millennia to recover,
to get the,

179
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:30.750
get the labor force necessary to undertake major Mont monumental programs on the

180
00:10:30.751 --> 00:10:33.930
Giza plateau.
So,
so I think that that the,

181
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.230
if we assume this gradual listic scenario,
yeah,

182
00:10:37.231 --> 00:10:40.590
that's a fair question to ask were what happened in that interval.

183
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:45.980
But if there is a major climatic downturn and a major disruption of the settled

184
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.790
patterns of whatever culture was already there,
then you know,

185
00:10:50.791 --> 00:10:53.280
now we might have an explanation why there would be a gap,

186
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:57.170
especially if these events caused a,
uh,

187
00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:01.650
a bottleneck in the population of the area.
Of course this is all speculative,

188
00:11:01.651 --> 00:11:06.450
but it is not speculative to say that there is multiple lines of evidence

189
00:11:06.451 --> 00:11:11.451
suggesting these major even cataclysmic changes that engulfed that part of the

190
00:11:11.641 --> 00:11:14.400
world during that era.
So that could,

191
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:19.320
that could provide an explanation of why there is a gap there.
Makes total sense.

192
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.740
Well it doesn't because does it not,

193
00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:28.320
it only if you have to have this things in conjunction with 12,000 years ago in

194
00:11:28.591 --> 00:11:29.580
the La Civilization.

195
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:34.170
If you just say that rain water erosion on the Sphinx,

196
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:35.120
uh,

197
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.900
it is not an explanation for the age and that the traditional accepted age is

198
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.260
what we think it is,
then there's no gap to fill.
Yeah.

199
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:47.070
So really all we're talking about is we have,
again,
lots of evidence here.

200
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.040
One anomaly here.
I really want the anomaly thing to stick.

201
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.890
So I got to explain the gap.
The gap is explained by environmental changes.

202
00:11:55.590 --> 00:12:00.060
<v 0>Lots of evidence other than a lot of assumptions.
It's,
and a lot of maybes.</v>

203
00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.150
It's only,
I mean,
actually,

204
00:12:01.151 --> 00:12:05.020
can you cite me as single contemporary inscription from the date that the Sphinx

205
00:12:05.021 --> 00:12:09.040
is supposed to have been made that refers to the swings?
I'm sorry.

206
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:14.310
Can you cite a single contemporary inscription to temporary from the

207
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:18.160
contemporary to the date that Egyptologist subscribe to the Sphinx?

208
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:19.630
In other words,
to the reign of [inaudible].

209
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:22.810
Can you cite me as single inscription that talks about the Sphinx being built?

210
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.050
This is,
I don't study this area.
I don't know.
Okay.

211
00:12:26.051 --> 00:12:29.380
Well you can't because there is no such description.
Okay,
well,

212
00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:32.850
so what one would have thought there would,
well,
maybe it's a giant project.

213
00:12:32.851 --> 00:12:37.320
There's 270 feet long.
It's 70 feet high.
It's carved out of solid rock.
Nothing.

214
00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.640
No reference to how tall in the old kingdom.

215
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.560
You actually have to come down to the new kingdom to get references to the

216
00:12:42.561 --> 00:12:43.920
Sphinx in inscriptions that,

217
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:47.020
but you've already said that the pyramids were built at the time we think they

218
00:12:47.021 --> 00:12:48.700
were built,
not thousands of.

219
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:51.700
I would say that a great deal of work was done on the pyramids at the time of

220
00:12:51.701 --> 00:12:54.340
2,500 pieces.
And I think the ground plan was laid out.

221
00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:55.960
We have like the step pyramid,

222
00:12:55.961 --> 00:12:59.240
which is crude or not as well designed as the other pyramids.
That's it.

223
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:03.220
That's a transitional stage at that time off and argued to be a transitional

224
00:13:03.221 --> 00:13:06.370
stage.
Have you been to the step pyramid?
I'm sure.
Right?

225
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:10.060
And you've been to Giza though?
No,
I've never been to Giza.
Oh dear.
Well,

226
00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:12.430
will they do make a very different impact?
I mean,

227
00:13:12.431 --> 00:13:15.060
I've climbed the Great Pyramid five times.
I mean,

228
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:19.090
you're dealing with something orders of magnitude different in terms of what's

229
00:13:19.091 --> 00:13:21.370
required.
I mean this thing weighs 6 million,

230
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.550
but it's 481 feet high.

231
00:13:24.551 --> 00:13:28.360
It consists of two and a half million individual blocks of stone.

232
00:13:28.361 --> 00:13:32.890
It's aligned to true north within three 60th of a single degree.
I mean,

233
00:13:32.891 --> 00:13:37.180
to compare that to [inaudible],
uh,
is really not a valid comparison at all.

234
00:13:37.181 --> 00:13:41.230
What's more interesting to me is the radical decline that takes place in pyramid

235
00:13:41.231 --> 00:13:44.890
building skills.
In the fifth and sixth dynasty,
go to Ou Nassco to pepe,

236
00:13:44.891 --> 00:13:47.530
go to teddy at Sakara.
These are a shambles.

237
00:13:47.531 --> 00:13:49.390
You can hardly even recognize them as a pyramid.

238
00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.510
What happened to all that knowledge that's invested in the Great Pyramid?

239
00:13:52.511 --> 00:13:55.670
Why does Egypt to devolve so rapidly?
Uh,

240
00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:00.040
how do we explain this pristine,
amazing work that's done on the Great Pyramid?

241
00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.770
Unless there's a legacy of knowledge being attached to it.
Okay,

242
00:14:02.771 --> 00:14:07.390
so every archeologist,
Egypt,
Egyptian archeologist and Egyptian,

243
00:14:07.391 --> 00:14:10.750
I'll knows everything you just said they did and they don't accept any of your

244
00:14:10.751 --> 00:14:12.760
arguments.
Why not?
That's why I needed,

245
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.510
because somebody's got to counter this is it just that they're closed minded and

246
00:14:16.511 --> 00:14:19.810
they follow a,
as I hear of us and they never think for themselves.

247
00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:20.790
You want to see a coroner's mind?

248
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.170
I'll play or one and a half minute video of Zaria wash refusing to debate with

249
00:14:24.171 --> 00:14:25.660
me.
But all of them,

250
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:30.220
every one of the Egyptologist and archaeologist over the last two centuries and

251
00:14:30.221 --> 00:14:33.070
so on,
they know they're all dogmatically close minded.

252
00:14:33.071 --> 00:14:35.500
And they can't see the arguments declares you or is it,

253
00:14:35.501 --> 00:14:38.860
they're not convinced by your argument.
They're not convinced by my argument.

254
00:14:38.861 --> 00:14:42.580
They genuinely an absolutely believe that their argument is right.

255
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:46.620
The notion that I'm proposing is apparently so preposterous to them that it

256
00:14:46.621 --> 00:14:48.310
isn't even worthy of consideration,

257
00:14:48.311 --> 00:14:52.850
but it is worthy of insults and attacks on me,
on my integrity,

258
00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:57.710
on my decency as a human being on my honesty.
All of those things get attacked,

259
00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:00.740
you know,
because main street and that's fine.
I'm ready for that.
And that,

260
00:15:00.741 --> 00:15:02.890
by the way,
I know that archaeologists,

261
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.390
academics constantly attack each other all the time.

262
00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:06.940
I used to take this stuff personally,
but then I just,

263
00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.550
when I see what they do to each other,
the ravaging attack dogs,

264
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:15.770
I let loose on,
on any new idea.
I sometimes wish scientists would,

265
00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.830
would actually look for what's good in a new idea rather than what's bad.

266
00:15:18.831 --> 00:15:21.320
But I get why they do it for what's bad.
But in other words,

267
00:15:21.321 --> 00:15:24.920
a grant that some young graduate student working in that area could make a name

268
00:15:24.921 --> 00:15:26.940
for himself by overturning,
uh,
you know,

269
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:31.050
my son was a young graduate student at the University of Cardiff studying

270
00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:31.070
Egyptology.

271
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:34.550
He got marked down in his degree because he proposed the possibility that the

272
00:15:34.551 --> 00:15:38.140
pyramids and the Sphinx might be or might have older origins.
Uh,

273
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:42.000
he was impressed by my work.
It did him a lot of harm in his degree.
And,

274
00:15:42.001 --> 00:15:44.920
and if all of this was true,
uh,
that event,

275
00:15:44.921 --> 00:15:47.150
you organize it by point by point,

276
00:15:47.151 --> 00:15:49.430
which is if you go against the mainstream view,

277
00:15:49.431 --> 00:15:52.670
your career does not progress as an egyptologist.
I disagree.
I mean,

278
00:15:52.671 --> 00:15:56.200
how many an example,
how is it that we know anything that we know about Egypt,

279
00:15:56.201 --> 00:15:56.721
for example,

280
00:15:56.721 --> 00:15:59.480
from Egypt tology of somebody who's gone against the mainstream view and being

281
00:15:59.481 --> 00:16:00.890
lauded for,
so doing well,
look,

282
00:16:00.891 --> 00:16:04.840
we don't believe everything about it that we believe two centuries ago say

283
00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:08.510
Napoleon's time.
Right?
How did all that knowledge come about?

284
00:16:08.511 --> 00:16:11.960
How did all the change and that science technology begins with Sham polyon and

285
00:16:11.961 --> 00:16:13.960
the deciphering of the Rosetta stone.
Right.
All right.

286
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.550
How was he able to do that against the mainstream?
There was no main stream.

287
00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.850
All right.
So,
but he was a client that was nice.

288
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:23.480
The mainstream has taken time to form and it's a very solid now.
I mean,

289
00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:28.490
just all sing from the same hymnbook you'll find very little disagreement every

290
00:16:28.491 --> 00:16:31.430
field.
But somehow or another Einstein managed to,

291
00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:35.360
to make an impact because he turned out to be right.
Well,
I'm no Einstein,

292
00:16:35.361 --> 00:16:36.410
and I don't know if I'm right,

293
00:16:36.411 --> 00:16:39.310
but I'm going to continue to oppose that main street if somebody has to us,

294
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:43.880
if that's a valid comparison.
Einstein and archeology take Paleo anthropology.

295
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:47.120
I mean,
it's a completely different field now than a century ago.

296
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:50.840
How did that happen?
If no one ever accepts new ideas?
They do.

297
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:52.190
It happens all the time.

298
00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:02.240
<v 2>Okay.</v>
