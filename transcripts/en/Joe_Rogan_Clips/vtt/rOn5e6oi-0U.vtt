1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.600
So where are open chasing the scream is with this story that I think a lot of

2
00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:04.620
people,
um,

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.310
think why the fuck is a book about the war on drugs starting like this?

4
00:00:08.311 --> 00:00:10.590
And I think it tells you so much.
Um,

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.150
so in 1939 in a hotel in midtown Manhattan,
Billie holiday,

6
00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:19.710
the great jazz singer walked on stage and she sang for the first time a song

7
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:22.290
that I'm sure all your listeners and viewers have heard.

8
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.920
It's a song called strange fruit,
writes a song against lynching.

9
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.810
It's the idea that,
uh,
in the south,

10
00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:30.540
the bodies of African American men hang from the trees and they're like a kind

11
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:34.890
of strange fruit in the south,
right?
This is unbelievably challenging.

12
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.690
At that time,
the very few popular songs like that,
um,
and,

13
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.960
and to have an African American woman doing it was quite shocking,
right?

14
00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:45.540
She wasn't even allowed to walk through the front door with that hotel.

15
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.630
They made her go through the service elevator.
She was African American.

16
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.000
And that night Billy holiday gets a warning from a man called Harry Anslinger

17
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:57.390
for the agents of a man called Harry Anslinger that basically says,

18
00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:59.490
stop singing this song.
Right?
You think,

19
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.770
what's this got to do with the war on drugs?
So Harry Anslinger is a man.
Uh,

20
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.860
it was a government bureaucrat.

21
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.190
I think the most influential person no one's ever heard of is affected the lives

22
00:01:08.191 --> 00:01:09.780
of loads of people listening to your show.

23
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.530
It's Harry Anslinger was a government bureaucrat who takes over the Department

24
00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:16.830
of prohibition just as alcohol prohibition is ending.

25
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.310
So you've had this big war on alcohol.
It's been a shit show.

26
00:01:20.311 --> 00:01:21.390
It's been a disaster.

27
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.550
And he takes it over and he wants to keep his government department going and he

28
00:01:26.551 --> 00:01:30.420
invents the modern war on drugs is the first person to ever use the phrase war

29
00:01:30.421 --> 00:01:31.890
on drugs.
And,

30
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.540
and he really builds this war on drugs around two intense hatreds he has.

31
00:01:36.541 --> 00:01:39.090
And Billie holiday's,
the personification of both.

32
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.370
One was a really intense hatred of African Americans.
I mean,

33
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.300
he was regarded as a crazy racist in the 1920s which gives you a sense of how

34
00:01:48.301 --> 00:01:52.110
racist he was.
He used the n word so often in official memos.

35
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
His own senator said it,
you'd have to resign.
That's how hardcore he was.
Right.

36
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.810
And he also had an intense hatred of people with addiction problems and Billie

37
00:02:00.811 --> 00:02:03.420
holiday,
and she'd grown up on the streets of Baltimore,

38
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.830
part of Baltimore called pig town.
She,
when she was 10 she was horrific.

39
00:02:07.831 --> 00:02:11.460
She was raped.
The man who raped her was sent to prison for a year and a half.

40
00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:15.560
She was sent a reformatory for longer than he got right.
She,

41
00:02:15.561 --> 00:02:19.230
she was tormented by the nuns there.
They said he was disobedient.

42
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.580
She brought it on herself.

43
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.730
They used to lock her in the dead bodies overnight to teach her a lesson.

44
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.100
She eventually ran away.
She tried to find her mother.

45
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.280
Her mother had gone to what's now called about Roosevelt island.
Now,

46
00:02:29.281 --> 00:02:29.821
it wasn't called that.

47
00:02:29.821 --> 00:02:34.170
Then when she was working as a prostitute and Billie holiday starts kind of

48
00:02:34.171 --> 00:02:37.950
working in inverted commas next to her mother in this Brotha for when she's like

49
00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:41.850
14.
So she's been raped by men for money night after night after night.
She's,

50
00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:45.300
you know,
and when they,
the police rescue,
rescue break into the brothel,

51
00:02:45.301 --> 00:02:48.210
they arrest her,
right and send it to prison.
Um,

52
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.780
so Billie holiday's trying to numb the grief and pain that comes from that.

53
00:02:53.821 --> 00:02:54.450
Right?

54
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.290
So she starts out using loads of alcohol and then she's using loads of other

55
00:02:58.291 --> 00:03:00.100
stuff as well,
mostly heroin.

56
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.030
And when she gets this warning from Harry Anslinger Sang,

57
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:09.730
stop singing this song,
Billie holiday's attitude is,
fuck you,

58
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.170
I'm an American citizen.
I'll sing what I fucking please.
Right?
And at that point,

59
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.360
Harry Anslinger resolves to destroy her.

60
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.680
The first man he sent to to tracker is a man called follow her around,

61
00:03:21.681 --> 00:03:25.660
is guy called Jimmy Fletcher.
Harry Anslinger hated employing a white people.

62
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.490
Sorry,
I hated employing African Americans,

63
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.430
but you couldn't really send a white person into Harlem to follow Billie holiday

64
00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:32.020
where it be kind of obvious,
say employed.

65
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:34.030
This African American guy called Jimmy Fletcher,
he just quit.

66
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.340
His job title was a bag man.
So he was given the job,

67
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.120
follow Billie holiday everywhere she goes,
befriend her,
document,
her druggies,

68
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.320
right.
He dances with her in nightclubs.
It gets to know her really well.

69
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.120
And Billie holiday was so amazing that Jimmy Fletcher fell in love with her and

70
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:53.460
his whole life,
he felt really ashamed of what he did.
He busts,
uh,
uh,
they,

71
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.250
when they come into searcher,
she,
she,
she,
uh,
makes him,

72
00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.660
she pisses in front of him and says,

73
00:03:58.661 --> 00:04:02.040
you can look in my purse so you can see I don't have anything here.
Um,

74
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.010
she's put on trial at the trial was called the United States versus Billie

75
00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:07.780
holiday.
And she said that's how it fucking felt.

76
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.890
She sent to prison for 18 months.
She doesn't say a word in prison,

77
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.060
but what happened to her next I think is the cruelest thing she gets out of

78
00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:20.800
prison.
Um,
and at that time to sing anywhere where they served alcohol,

79
00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:23.900
you needed what was called a cabaret performer's license.
Um,

80
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.660
Anslinger make sure she doesn't get it.
So one of her friends,

81
00:04:26.661 --> 00:04:29.230
your land up a van is also great jazz singer said to me,

82
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.380
what's the cruelest thing you can do to a person is to take away the thing they

83
00:04:32.381 --> 00:04:35.050
love,
right?
They take away singing from Billie holiday.

84
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.990
So what we do to people with addiction problems all over the United States,

85
00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:38.590
right?

86
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.740
We give them criminal records that make it much harder to do the things that are

87
00:04:41.741 --> 00:04:45.910
meaningful to them by work.
For example.
Um,
so in that situation,

88
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.810
obviously Billie holiday relapses,
right?
She starts using a shit ton of heroin.

89
00:04:49.811 --> 00:04:52.420
Again,
a one day in the early fifties,
she,

90
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.210
she collapses not far from where she first song strange fruit.
Um,

91
00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.000
the first hospital won't even take her cause that cause she's got an addiction

92
00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:04.090
problem.
They said we're not having a second hospital takes her,

93
00:05:04.091 --> 00:05:05.190
but she says to her friend,

94
00:05:05.191 --> 00:05:10.191
mainly dusty on the way in the Anslinger is men weren't done with her.

95
00:05:10.421 --> 00:05:12.640
They were going to come from,
she said they're going to kill me in there.

96
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.250
Don't let them,
they're going to kill me.
She wasn't wrong.

97
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.790
So in the hospital she's diagnosed with advanced liver cancer,

98
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.960
um,
probably related to severe alcoholism.
Um,

99
00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.140
and in the hospital she,
um,
she goes into heroin withdrawal,

100
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.400
so Maley for our managers to insist that she's giving methadone and she starts

101
00:05:33.401 --> 00:05:35.860
to recover a bit,
cause her and was quite dangerous when you're weak,
right?

102
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.580
Like when you're old.
We've,
um,
Anslinger is men come,

103
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.440
they arrest her on her hospital bed.
They handcuffed her to the hospital.

104
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:46.030
But I interviewed the last person who was still alive.

105
00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:49.210
You've been in that room or a man called Reverend Eugene calendar who'd been a

106
00:05:49.211 --> 00:05:52.930
religious minister.
Um,
they handcuffed her to a hospital bed.

107
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.760
They don't let her friends and to see her,

108
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.720
they don't like or even have candies outside reverend calendar led protests with

109
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:03.050
signs saying let lady day live.
There were big protests.

110
00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:05.430
They knew they were killing her.
Right.
Um,

111
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.840
then after 10 days they cut off the Methadone or she died the next day.

112
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.770
Her friend,

113
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.680
one of her friends told the BBC that she looked like she had been violently

114
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:14.240
wrenched from life.
Right?

115
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.890
There's loads of things about this storage to be made into a movie and Lee

116
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:19.723
Daniels is directing it.

117
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.030
There's so many things about this story that tell us what this war on drugs is

118
00:06:25.031 --> 00:06:28.330
about,
right?
Firstly,
it's about,
um,

119
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.370
it's effect.
It's about shaming addicts in its effect as it makes attics worse,

120
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.280
right?
Is that where Billie holiday see that everywhere.
Secondly,

121
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.760
it's been insanely racist from the start,
right?
At the same time,

122
00:06:39.761 --> 00:06:42.070
the Harry Anslinger found out Billy holiday had a heroin addiction.

123
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.250
He found out Judy Garland,
Dorothy from the wizard of Oz had a heroin addiction.

124
00:06:45.251 --> 00:06:47.850
It may change as I watched the wizard of Oz when you know that,
um,

125
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.560
and he went to the studio and he advised,

126
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:56.140
he said to Judy Garland into the studio,
she should take longer vacations,
right?

127
00:06:56.141 --> 00:06:58.840
Spot the difference with a white woman,
Judy Garland,

128
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.740
longer vacations with Billie holiday,
fucking destroy her,
right?
Uh,

129
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.710
if at one of the agents he sent to destroy her,
a man called George White,

130
00:07:05.711 --> 00:07:08.920
who has got a tractor in the last days of their life,
we now know,

131
00:07:08.921 --> 00:07:13.870
I mean he's literally a psychopath.
He was a hugely obese guys kind,
strange guy.

132
00:07:13.871 --> 00:07:17.260
He infiltrated a Chinese drug gang when he wasn't Chinese the person to ever do

133
00:07:17.261 --> 00:07:20.890
that.
But he,
um,
he boasted in his diary about murdering people,

134
00:07:20.891 --> 00:07:22.690
about spiking women or raping them.
I mean,

135
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:27.190
these were really deranged people that were founded.
The,
the,
the drug will,

136
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.330
but the reason I say in relation to what we were just talking about is because

137
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.160
in this culture,

138
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:37.390
we tell only one heroic story about people with addiction problems and that's

139
00:07:37.391 --> 00:07:41.140
what they sometimes recover from their addiction.
That is indeed a heroic story.

140
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:42.730
Everyone watching this has been,

141
00:07:42.731 --> 00:07:46.900
who's managed to do that is a hero and I massively love congratulate them.

142
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.350
But that is not the only heroic story we should tell about people with addiction

143
00:07:50.351 --> 00:07:54.790
problems.
Billie holiday never stopped using drugs.
She was still a fucking hero.

144
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:59.080
She any,
she never let these people stop her singing that song.

145
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.900
She would go to the places where you didn't have a license,

146
00:08:01.901 --> 00:08:06.220
you'd go to the worst parts of the deep south.
She sang strange fruit,

147
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.280
they people threw bottles at her,
they stopped out cigarettes on her.

148
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.130
She never stopped singing that song.
Right.

149
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.730
And I think about Billie Holiday a lot,
and I think about,

150
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.233
<v 1>you know,</v>

151
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.230
<v 0>all over the world,</v>

152
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:24.440
every day people listen to Billie holiday and they feel stronger and all over

153
00:08:24.441 --> 00:08:24.801
the world.

154
00:08:24.801 --> 00:08:28.280
Every day we are still following the policies of Harry Anslinger and it makes us

155
00:08:28.281 --> 00:08:29.114
weaker.

156
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.830
And this conflict that begins right at the start of the drug.

157
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.240
And I think if I'm honest,
I think this isn't an easy thing to say,

158
00:08:38.241 --> 00:08:43.241
but I think one of the reasons why the debate about the drug wars so charged is

159
00:08:43.491 --> 00:08:44.990
because it runs through the hearts of all of us,
right?

160
00:08:44.991 --> 00:08:47.660
Anyone who's got someone they love,
he's got an addiction problem as I do.

161
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.250
There's a Harry Anslinger in your head,
right?

162
00:08:52.251 --> 00:08:54.830
There's a bit of view that looks at them and thinks someone should just fucking

163
00:08:54.831 --> 00:08:58.650
stop here.
Why are you doing this?
Someone should stop you doing this.

164
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.910
And then for most people,
there's another part that's like,
okay,

165
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.440
that anger isn't useful in most cases.
Um,

166
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.030
actually what you're doing this for a reason,

167
00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:11.910
we need to understand those reasons.
We need to help you to change your life,

168
00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:16.470
right?
But that conflict is,
is,
is very deep in us.

169
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:19.860
And Harry Anslinger the war he invented,

170
00:09:19.861 --> 00:09:21.810
and we can talk about what he did with cannabis and loads of other things,

171
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:26.811
but because he invented the ban on cannabis that that war is,

172
00:09:27.641 --> 00:09:29.760
is still playing out.
Does that make sense?
I know that was a long answer,

173
00:09:29.761 --> 00:09:32.730
but that's all right.
No,
it does make sense.

174
00:09:32.731 --> 00:09:35.010
And it's a horrific story about Billy all day.

175
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:40.370
And I had no idea that I'm Dorothy from the wizard of Oz was also addicted to

176
00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.620
the Munchkins.
A lot of them as well.
Now,

177
00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:48.600
Harry W W W why was Harry Anslinger is hate towards her so extreme.

178
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.200
So when he was a kid,
the book is called chasing the screen.

179
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.050
Cause when he was a kid,
he grew up in a place called Altoona in Pennsylvania.

180
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.320
And he lives in a farm house.

181
00:09:58.321 --> 00:10:00.960
His Dad was actually a refugee from world refugee in a bit comes immigrant from

182
00:10:00.961 --> 00:10:05.310
Switzerland.
Um,
and they grew up in this farm house.

183
00:10:05.311 --> 00:10:09.640
And in the next farm house down there was a,
a um,

184
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.340
a farmer's wife.
You had an a heroin addiction or methods,
sorry,

185
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:14.880
morphine addiction would've been hiring them.

186
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:19.590
And Harry Anslinger had this really haunting memory of going to that house and

187
00:10:19.591 --> 00:10:23.730
hearing this woman scream and scream and him being sent to take the horse and

188
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:23.881
cart,

189
00:10:23.881 --> 00:10:27.000
think it was 11 or something being sent to take the horse and cart into town to

190
00:10:27.001 --> 00:10:30.180
go to the pharmacy to get her the morphine and then bringing it back in her

191
00:10:30.181 --> 00:10:31.200
scream,
stopping.

192
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.950
The lesson he took from that is these drugs are evil and we need to destroy
them,

193
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.370
especially later on.
He,

194
00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:41.510
he was in Europe during the first world war and he had this very keen,

195
00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:46.540
it was a diplomat and had this very keen sense that civilization was incredibly

196
00:10:46.951 --> 00:10:49.470
fragile.
It could collapse at any moment,

197
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:54.060
that you only need a little bit of contamination and it would all go to shit.
Um,

198
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:57.780
and,
and,
and so he,
yeah,
I call it chasing the screen.

199
00:10:57.781 --> 00:11:00.810
Cause I think in a way what Harris thing is doing is like chasing the scream all

200
00:11:00.811 --> 00:11:02.340
over the world.
And I felt like I was doing,

201
00:11:02.341 --> 00:11:04.890
going to all these different places from the killing fields in Mexico to

202
00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:05.701
Portugal.

203
00:11:05.701 --> 00:11:09.510
And Switzerland was like following this scream as it kind of ricocheted around.

204
00:11:09.511 --> 00:11:11.100
And actually how he made,

205
00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:15.120
he thinks he's stopping these screams is actually creating far more screams in

206
00:11:15.121 --> 00:11:18.360
their,
in their,
in their place.
Yeah.

207
00:11:18.361 --> 00:11:21.760
But I still don't understand why he had this totally holiday so,

208
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:26.130
well she's an African American woman standing up to white supremacy who has an

209
00:11:26.131 --> 00:11:29.510
addiction problem.
But the truth is what he did to Billie holiday is not pretty,

210
00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:30.803
it's not,

211
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.230
this is what you did to African Americans and people with addiction problems.

212
00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:36.870
Billie holiday just happens to be famous.
I'm telling her story,

213
00:11:36.871 --> 00:11:39.810
but this is what he did to huge numbers of people,
right?

214
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.880
He wanted to destroy the whole jazz scene.

215
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.510
One of the amazing thing is spending time in his,
um,

216
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:49.230
archives in Penn state was seeing all these memos from,
uh,

217
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.750
his agents.
We said to them,
go to your local jazz club,

218
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.660
document the evil things that happening there and the things they wrote back.

219
00:11:55.661 --> 00:11:59.020
I caught a hilarious,
right,
there's one agent who,
I forget where it was,

220
00:11:59.021 --> 00:12:00.750
but he wrote back and was like,
um,

221
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.360
there was a popular jazz song at the time called,
uh,
that ocean ma'am,

222
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:07.600
and had a lyric that said,
when he gets the notion,

223
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.540
he thinks he can walk across the ocean and he's like,

224
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:14.170
there was going to be an epidemic of drowning across the United States as people

225
00:12:14.171 --> 00:12:17.590
use cannabis because they're going to believe they can walk on water.

226
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.800
So he would,
he was like,
I been looked through the hilarious we were at,
he said,

227
00:12:20.801 --> 00:12:25.000
uh,
you know,
he believed that when you smoke cannabis,
time slows down.

228
00:12:25.001 --> 00:12:27.430
So a minute seems to last a thousand years.

229
00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:31.630
Like these extraordinarily heightened,
crazy things that he would,
he would say.

230
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:32.561
And he actually latched.

231
00:12:32.561 --> 00:12:36.640
So at that time when he first takes over what becomes the Federal Bureau of

232
00:12:36.641 --> 00:12:40.360
narcotics,
cocaine and heroin just aren't very popular.
Right?

233
00:12:40.361 --> 00:12:42.640
There's just not much of a water fight.
I mean they exist,

234
00:12:42.641 --> 00:12:46.810
but they're not that popular that can find a small urban scenes kind of this was

235
00:12:46.811 --> 00:12:49.580
more popular,
not as popular as it is now,
but an,

236
00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:53.890
and he had previously said,
cannabis isn't harmful,

237
00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:57.220
not bothered about it.
He suddenly,
when he cottons on that,

238
00:12:57.221 --> 00:12:59.290
this is the way it's a big buildup.
His department,

239
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.770
he announces that cannabis is a phrase he used was the most evil drug in the

240
00:13:02.771 --> 00:13:07.540
world.
He said when Frankenstein's monster bumps into a spliff on the staircase,

241
00:13:07.541 --> 00:13:09.340
Frankenstein's monster dies of fright.

242
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:13.920
Like Lee's extraordinarily heightened claims.
Um,
and,

243
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.680
and any,
any issues,
charts trying to get support for a ban on cannabis.

244
00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.910
And he latches onto one case in particular.
I some point,

245
00:13:20.911 --> 00:13:23.790
cause I think we're hearing these again,
these things again now.
Um,

246
00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:26.890
so a kid in Tampa,
Florida called Victor Lie Carter.

247
00:13:26.891 --> 00:13:31.120
He was not so much kid 21 killed his entire family with an ax,

248
00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:35.080
but should the mall and with the help of the Fox News of its time,
Hearst,

249
00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.170
Hearst newspapers,
uh,

250
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:41.830
Anslinger announces this is what will happen if you use cannabis.
Literally,

251
00:13:41.831 --> 00:13:44.050
you will kill your family with an ax,
right?

252
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:47.680
And this becomes a very famous story across the United States.

253
00:13:47.681 --> 00:13:49.840
And Cannabis has banned in its wake.
Years later,

254
00:13:49.841 --> 00:13:51.520
someone goes and checks the psychiatric files.

255
00:13:51.521 --> 00:13:54.520
But until I kinda wasn't even evidence it'd be used cannabis,
right?

256
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:57.160
He had terrible problems with psychosis.

257
00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.980
His family had been advised more than a year before that he should be

258
00:13:59.981 --> 00:14:02.080
institutionalized.
And they refused.
They kept him at home.

259
00:14:02.081 --> 00:14:05.920
And this tragedy ensued.
We're hearing these,

260
00:14:05.921 --> 00:14:08.040
these scare stories again about,
about cannabis.

261
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:11.260
There something that Anslinger said that I think could be like the motto for the

262
00:14:11.261 --> 00:14:13.980
entire drug war in the wake of the sec.

263
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.610
So Anslinger introduces this band in the u s he promises drugs will disappear,

264
00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.390
right?
You will notice drugs did not disappear.
He starts to say,

265
00:14:22.391 --> 00:14:25.870
well that's just cause evil foreign countries like Mexico are flooding our

266
00:14:25.871 --> 00:14:28.810
country with drugs.
You'll notice that's come back as well.
Um,

267
00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.600
so what we need to do is force all these other countries to band them as well,

268
00:14:31.601 --> 00:14:32.650
and then they'll disappear.

269
00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.260
So the u s in the wake of the Second World War where it has the power to do
that,

270
00:14:35.261 --> 00:14:36.850
the world is in ruins.
Um,

271
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.780
and there's one point when he goes to the new United Nations and he's insisting

272
00:14:40.781 --> 00:14:43.000
this happens and they're basically threatening people.
They're saying,

273
00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:46.890
we'll cut off your foreign aid or you won't be allowed to sell goods to the US

274
00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:51.560
market if you don't do this.
The ambassador from Thailand is like,
well,
you know,

275
00:14:51.561 --> 00:14:53.270
it doesn't seem to work very well in your country.

276
00:14:53.271 --> 00:14:56.690
We've actually got a long pattern of established drug use in,
in Thailand.

277
00:14:56.691 --> 00:14:58.760
We don't really have many problems.
We don't want to do this.

278
00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:02.690
And Anslinger said to her,
I said to him,
I've made up my mind,

279
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.940
don't try to confuse me with the facts.

280
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:09.320
And I always feel like that's the drug war right.
And made up my mind.

281
00:15:09.321 --> 00:15:11.000
Don't try to confuse me with the facts.
