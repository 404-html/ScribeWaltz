1
00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.170
What do you think is the next big

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.950
<v 1>breakthrough that's going to change in terms of like how technology</v>

3
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.610
<v 0>and people get along?</v>

4
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.190
<v 1>He's going to be a robot sex tall.
No,
I think home home,</v>

5
00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:22.080
uh,
assistance,
you know,

6
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:26.460
like having a robot couldn't be your home base,
like computer.

7
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.890
Uh,
I dunno like these Alexis and I'll like Apple's about to release Thurs and

8
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.390
Google has released authors and have seen the autonomous robots that monitor

9
00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:39.150
parking lots now.
Yeah,

10
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.330
I tweeted it I think yesterday,

11
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.580
but definitely robots.

12
00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:49.380
We're going to give up our security and all our privacy at the same time.

13
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:50.803
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

14
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.740
<v 1>We're going to be fine because the robot's going to be watching us keep an eye</v>

15
00:00:54.741 --> 00:00:59.060
on me.
Robot.
This is going to be zero privacy.
Zero.

16
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.950
It's real close.
It's already there.

17
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.770
But I mean real close to not just regular zero privacy,

18
00:01:03.771 --> 00:01:08.240
but like no one ever has a moment alone ever.
It doesn't exist anymore.

19
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.770
Like it will slowly erode.

20
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.800
Then you'd go into the mountains in the put cell phone towers out there and then

21
00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:16.070
that's going to be it.
Whatever the technology is it's going to be,

22
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.750
you're going to know where everyone is at any moment and we're going to really

23
00:01:20.751 --> 00:01:21.620
get to know each other.

24
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.430
What do you got Jamie?
I was looking up for the thing I saw.
I saw it.

25
00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:30.440
It wasn't on your Twitter feed.

26
00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:33.340
I guess I saw a video of like autonomous parking robots,

27
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.080
building cars in and out of spots.
I didn't put it on Twitter.

28
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.850
I thought I did shit.
Um,
it was uh,
a comp.

29
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.440
Appreciate.
I retweeted it.

30
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.980
You know what it does though I think are retweeted somebody else saying,
hey,

31
00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:49.640
this is happening or something like that.
So it's probably not that clear.

32
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.700
One of the more recent tweets
tapping and Brian,

33
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.110
they're going to be flying around us monitoring us.
You saw that one robot,

34
00:01:58.111 --> 00:02:01.650
I think it was in San Francisco.
Eat Up homeless people or something like that.

35
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.310
Could move and stuff like that happens.
There's going to be a big pull back.

36
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.080
It's crazy.
Robots fucking need.
We need robots picking on the downtrodden.

37
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.830
That's good move.
Let them know you post.
These are on your way out.

38
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.060
The robots are here.

39
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.190
I mean that literally is like the first wave of immigrants from the silicone

40
00:02:20.191 --> 00:02:24.300
world.
Robots at fuck with homeless people.
The first,

41
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.650
the first invaders tripping him and stuff.
I robot.

42
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.680
The thing about I robot as you'd watch it and it was,

43
00:02:31.681 --> 00:02:33.570
it was made just at the right time.

44
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.440
It was made where you didn't think it's ever possible.
It's made at a time.

45
00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:40.140
Well this is pretty cool.
Like yeah man,
the future.
Yeah.

46
00:02:40.141 --> 00:02:41.160
I could see it being real,

47
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.510
but you didn't think it was really possible and now you watch I robot and you
go,

48
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.420
oh,
it's inevitable.
That's inevitable.

49
00:02:48.421 --> 00:02:53.190
That thing that does the robot thing would it pretends to be a person and looks

50
00:02:53.191 --> 00:02:58.180
real freaky.
That's easily doable.
Yakima or what's at Machinima?
What's that one?

51
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.230
There is hot shit it security robots are using are being used to ward off San

52
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.080
Francisco's homeless population.
That's the drug.
What's it called?

53
00:03:07.081 --> 00:03:11.670
Who makes that thing say they retired it?
Yeah.
Oh they did.

54
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.450
Because there's a,

55
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.020
there's a whole company that makes those things and has them like wandering

56
00:03:16.021 --> 00:03:20.580
around parking lots.
And Man,
I hope I retweeted it.
I tried to,

57
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.520
um,
somebody sent it to me and I was like,
okay.
That's how it happens.

58
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.980
They just have these things wandering around,
recording everything.

59
00:03:28.981 --> 00:03:33.360
So everybody's responsible for any car accident.
Anything that ever happens,

60
00:03:33.361 --> 00:03:35.340
if it hears is someone's screaming rape.

61
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.700
If it hears someone's screening police and immediately goes to the scene and

62
00:03:38.701 --> 00:03:42.600
films,
there's no worries about its own mortality.
It's streaming in real time.

63
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.760
It gets to record all altercations between people.
Eventually hotels agree.

64
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.630
As long as this is password secure and encrypted,

65
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.870
they allowed to have the fire detector in the corner double as a video camera

66
00:03:57.031 --> 00:04:01.260
that records everything in the room at all times.
What's going to happen.
Yeah,

67
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.170
I agree.
Just got to get used to people watching you fuck

68
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.470
<v 2>and ready.
I took the sticker off my webcam on my laptop a long time ago.
Oh,</v>

69
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.830
Joe.
They can watch me all I want.

70
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.960
<v 1>I don't know why I'm more nervous about this in 2018 this is what's silly.</v>

71
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.970
I mean,
it's become accelerated.
Like I,

72
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.200
I'm more nervous every year when it comes to technology because I'm not nervous

73
00:04:24.201 --> 00:04:27.770
in a,
in a way that I think it's totally 100% negative but nervous in a way.

74
00:04:27.771 --> 00:04:30.980
Like it just seems to me that we might be in the middle of something and not be

75
00:04:30.981 --> 00:04:32.360
paying attention like it,

76
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.810
that it's happening so fucking fast that we're caught up in it and it's just

77
00:04:36.811 --> 00:04:39.440
this wild wave of change.

78
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.360
And I'm just trying to make sense of it while it's happening.

79
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.610
But then there's something about like numbers,

80
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.850
like I used to think that saying like the year 2017 2000 it's a stupid,

81
00:04:49.791 --> 00:04:52.790
who cares what year it is?
It's all just now.
But no,

82
00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.090
there's like a way we feel about it differently.
Like you,
oh,

83
00:04:56.091 --> 00:04:59.000
it's fucking 2018 dude,
dude.

84
00:04:59.001 --> 00:05:03.380
It's like you have a feeling about you now.
It's like we're,
we're very,

85
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.770
very far ahead in this game.
This is,

86
00:05:07.771 --> 00:05:11.700
this is the future.
2018 that's a crazy number.
Hey Man,

87
00:05:11.701 --> 00:05:15.420
it's 1979 nope,
it's 2018 whoa.

88
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.063
So weird.

89
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.420
And when does this thing like if you had a gas,

90
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.210
<v 2>how much longer does the human race have?
Six months.</v>

91
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.440
It seems like you really,

92
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.220
<v 1>if you really had to guess,
we're not going to be here forever.
Right?</v>

93
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.760
So we're not going to be here a hundred thousand years from now or 200,000 years

94
00:05:37.761 --> 00:05:38.840
from now.
We're just not.

95
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.050
<v 2>I started listening to the audio book of Sapiens.
Yeah,
and that's,</v>

96
00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:44.580
I feel like that's what it's getting to.

97
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.000
That question you're asking is the first couple of chapters are leading up to

98
00:05:48.001 --> 00:05:51.180
like he says it over and over again like thousands of years from now.

99
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.890
Maybe 2000 is what it's saying that the human race won't be or human beings

100
00:05:55.891 --> 00:05:58.310
won't be what we are.
We'll be another

101
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.590
<v 1>evolution of whatever that is because I'm off of Australia.
[inaudible]</v>

102
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.190
Australia.
Pithiest see if you find any good pictures of that thing.

103
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.360
I mean this is what they think.
They think that that that's what started it.

104
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.540
That was when it was like fairly distinctly human.
It's gonna.

105
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.890
It's gonna keep going.
It's going to go to some new thing,
right?
There it is.

106
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.180
Look at that thing.
I mean,
that's so close.
It's what?

107
00:06:23.181 --> 00:06:28.181
Like a walking upright chimpanzee and then that got smarter and that got smarter

108
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:31.730
and things kept going,
but the thing that really fucks you up is,

109
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:35.210
it's not that long ago.
I think Australia.
Perfect.

110
00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:38.250
This was less than 2 million years,
right?
Sounds right.

111
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.480
And then there's a modern homo sapiens,

112
00:06:41.481 --> 00:06:46.481
which I think they think are somewhere in the neighborhood of 300 to 500,000

113
00:06:47.391 --> 00:06:49.970
years old.
They keep moving it around a little bit.

114
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:54.620
When they find some new dead guy,
I find some new bones and they're like,
oh,

115
00:06:54.621 --> 00:06:58.850
this one's older.
They got to,
they're kind of guessing.

116
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.540
I want to say they're in the neighborhood of 300,000 that ain't shit,
dude.

117
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:06.080
That ain't shit.
That just happened.
If that's when they really started.

118
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.190
That just happened.
So you're talking about 300,000 years from now.

119
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.880
Ooh,
it's crazy.
We're going to be made out of gas.

120
00:07:13.881 --> 00:07:16.100
We're going to be like those fires that aren't petroleum.

121
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.060
We won't be able to see us are intelligent to be all pervasive.

122
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.470
We'll we'll have one operating system that we share with mother earth.

123
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.970
They'll plug it into our brains will plug into the ground and we'll will become

124
00:07:28.971 --> 00:07:33.860
divine.
How about that?
No,
I don't know.
No one's here.

125
00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:37.370
That's how I am like that.
I'm going just told him he'll come back,

126
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.160
but I always wonder what they thought about this 200 years ago.
150 years ago,

127
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.440
what they thought are we,

128
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.560
I feel like they had thought that the world was gonna end to back then.
Yeah,

129
00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.520
but he's always talking years away from it ending.
Sure.
I mean anytime.
Anything,

130
00:07:51.521 --> 00:07:53.170
especially back when there was no media,

131
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.080
anytime anything catastrophic happened in your area,

132
00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:57.850
you thought that was going to be the end.

133
00:07:58.970 --> 00:07:59.550
<v 0>Okay.</v>

134
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.500
<v 1>The moon was made of cheese.
It's,</v>

135
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:07.980
it's really weird how recent that was.
That's what's weird.

136
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.380
When you just think about hundreds of thousands years,

137
00:08:10.381 --> 00:08:14.760
it seems like a long ass time,
but it's not.

138
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:15.420
When you talk,

139
00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:20.420
talk about the shape of human beings and what what's happened in that amount of

140
00:08:20.491 --> 00:08:24.990
time,
especially in the last few hundred or few thousand years,

141
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.370
just all you need is sick.

142
00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.490
If you want to like really impress the shit out of people,
give me 10,000 years,

143
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:34.620
10,000 years ago,
10,000 years now you're like,
wow,
you'd freak out.

144
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.110
There's no other time in history.
That would be the case.

145
00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.220
Like every other time in history,
10,000 years would be like,
whoa,

146
00:08:40.221 --> 00:08:43.110
all they figured out how to make cooler houses.
Like,
Whoa,

147
00:08:43.111 --> 00:08:46.020
he's riding an elephant.
How do you figure that out?
Like,
Whoa,

148
00:08:46.021 --> 00:08:49.260
all that bone Arrow is way better than my bow and Arrow every 10,000 years.

149
00:08:49.261 --> 00:08:51.450
It's no big deal.
And then all of a sudden,

150
00:08:51.451 --> 00:08:54.960
one 10,000 year period and you have everything,

151
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.520
you got the pyramids,
you got space travel,
you've got the internet,

152
00:08:59.521 --> 00:09:03.930
you've got video photography,
three d printers.

153
00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.360
<v 2>Every time you say something like this,
this uh,
pops in my head,</v>

154
00:09:07.361 --> 00:09:11.440
the end of gangs in New York where it shows that montage of the hundred years or

155
00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.530
so of New York changing.
Nice.

156
00:09:13.531 --> 00:09:18.340
Think about how that's only a hundred years in New York changed from this crazy

157
00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:19.451
nothingness,

158
00:09:19.451 --> 00:09:24.130
even though it's really big then to like tons of skyscrapers and bridges and all

159
00:09:24.131 --> 00:09:27.850
of what it is today and it wasn't any,
anything close to that back then.

160
00:09:27.851 --> 00:09:30.180
And that's like what a hundred years and you're talking about 10,000

161
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.630
<v 1>well,
that's so much more time compared to a hundred yeah.</v>

162
00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:38.560
That's an amazing montage.
Timelapse what would you call that?
That's time lapse.

163
00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:43.090
Look at that.
That's incredible.
New York City's a freak out man,

164
00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.960
and even more crazy look at that.
It keeps going.
Yeah.
And that's even bigger now.

165
00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.610
Oh my God.
And towers aren't there.

166
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.070
<v 0>Okay.</v>

167
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:54.030
<v 1>Yeah.
New York City is a genuine freak out.
Unless you've been,
you should go.</v>

168
00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:55.530
<v 0>Okay.</v>

169
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.810
<v 1>If you've been in,
you get it,
you're like,
yeah,
it's not so love gone.</v>

170
00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:58.950
But if you haven't been,

171
00:09:58.951 --> 00:10:01.560
it's a paradigm shifter because you realize that it's possible.
