1
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.590
Last couple of years.
Calm has been interesting.

2
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.980
It was a lot of people that are fans of Donald Trump.

3
00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:13.470
A lot of people that aren't fans of Donald Trump.

4
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.070
And I think it's petty for you to be upset with anybody because they chose to

5
00:00:20.551 --> 00:00:23.940
vote for whoever they chose to vote for.
I think it's stupid shit.

6
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.100
But I will say this past election was interesting in the sense that a lot of

7
00:00:29.101 --> 00:00:33.960
people were upset.
Black people were upset the last election.
Uh,
when we're upset,

8
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.380
gay people were upset,
but white people were really upset.

9
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.840
Like white people were the angriest and white people did not protest.

10
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.410
They voted.
Black people was like,
black lives matter white people.

11
00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:51.420
It's like we'll see about that in the morning and when ever you hear someone

12
00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:54.720
says,
we'll see about that in the morning.
It's going to be some change.

13
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.710
It's going to be some change.
But comedy,

14
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.690
I don't think kindness should be a place where people exercise anger or be

15
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.870
angry.
How so?
In what way?

16
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.230
That,
um,
like p and Matt,

17
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.200
like when Donald Trump first got elected,
you know,

18
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.830
personally like it,
it was very interested in,
and I seen a lot of comics,

19
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.510
they could just go up there and be like,
Fuck Donald Trump and just,
ah,

20
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.153
you know,

21
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.190
you could find a way to say fuck Donald Trump or anybody,

22
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.460
but it doesn't have to be fueled with any anger.
You know what I'm saying?

23
00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:41.520
It doesn't have to be fueled.
Like fuck.
You'd be like,
fuck them.
Okay.
Why?

24
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.060
Why do you say that?
Why do you say funnel?
And then loud the reason,

25
00:01:45.061 --> 00:01:50.061
but I just don't think that people should be angry about how you feel about

26
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.370
fine.
I think it's fucked up when politics made people

27
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.980
<v 1>angry.</v>

28
00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.750
It's it contrary to what you were saying was great about Chappelle show that the

29
00:02:00.751 --> 00:02:04.110
comedy came without being angry,
but it made great points,

30
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.880
but even anybody on both sides could laugh at it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

31
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.240
The thing about Trump that's,
it's interesting,
it's like

32
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.360
the job shouldn't exist.
The job of web president,
yes.
It shouldn't exist.

33
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.630
It's a ridiculous idea to have 300 million people under the guidance of one.

34
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.340
That's insane.
And that one's,
that one wins in a popularity contest.

35
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.610
That's insane.
Right?
It's fucking insane.
It doesn't make sense.
It was a,

36
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:36.570
it was a great idea back when they were pilgrims and it was a small colony and

37
00:02:36.571 --> 00:02:39.160
they just came over on a boat.
Forget it.
Forget about the rest of this shit.

38
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.510
It's just too many humans.
So when you let a guy like that,

39
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.350
like try to be president,
no,
he,
you're not going to be happy.

40
00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:47.400
No one's going to be happy.
Right,

41
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.120
but you're not going to be happy if anybody wins.
It's,
it's,
it's untenable.

42
00:02:51.121 --> 00:02:51.811
Look at Obama,

43
00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:55.640
Obama aged like how many of years in eight years he looked at yoga.

44
00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.160
<v 0>They all do that.
It's like Ted Danson effect once.
Cheers.
Got Counseling.</v>

45
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.800
Who the fuck is that?
You're the first time you saw Ted desert.

46
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:09.910
I'm not talking about years after two years.
Like after Fred.
You like God damn.

47
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:13.000
Stop dying his hair.
Yeah.
Yeah,
man.

48
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.320
Is there something about Trump before that that people enjoy that he was in a

49
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:18.460
lot of rap lyrics.

50
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.880
He was like the like people would probably still be if he was a rapper's to have

51
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:27.680
resident right now,
it'd be different.
He still be popular.
People wrap the bottom.

52
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.780
They liked that lifestyle.
But the thing was to just my thoughts.

53
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.760
The thing was because you thought
you knew a person,

54
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.730
you thought,
you know,
but even when he got elected,

55
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.260
I think a lot of people thought they knew him.
Right?
They thought they knew him.

56
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.690
They thought the image.
Like you ain't gonna be the billion.

57
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.050
Got Billion dollar playboy GAF ever.
But you thought you knew him.

58
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.740
But then when you got to know him,
you start to think,
well,

59
00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:58.110
maybe I didn't know him when you got to see him as president.
Yeah.
You get,

60
00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.963
I'm saying like,

61
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.080
I don't think even as even as much as even how he got elected,

62
00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:07.260
people were upset about it,
but I think a lot of people,
somebody was like,

63
00:04:07.261 --> 00:04:07.810
did you know what?

64
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.810
Maybe all of that shit was just to get elected.

65
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.610
Maybe that energy was to get elected and if that was the case that he'd mastered

66
00:04:19.611 --> 00:04:23.980
it,
he'd mastered how to get connected with his base.
He Massad Ma,

67
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.110
he mastered how to get,

68
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.800
not everybody the fuck would you put just the right amount of people?
Yeah,

69
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.840
he looked at the numbers.
It wasn't about them.
It was a popularity contest,

70
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.711
but it's also a new,

71
00:04:35.711 --> 00:04:38.320
like these are the people that got hit and he figured that out.

72
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.760
Did I think at some point Joe people were like,
hi,

73
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.630
okay,
it's over now.
Let's see who you really are.

74
00:04:46.631 --> 00:04:51.631
And I think it's so many examples of when you felt like he could showed people

75
00:04:52.871 --> 00:04:55.450
example,
example that he's fought.

76
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.190
Everybody opposed the judge just as base.
Right.

77
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.190
And I think that's what gets people ladder.
What make people frustrated.

78
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.740
He gives impression that,
you know,

79
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.930
I only care about these people that elected me.

80
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.950
You won.
Right?
But do you have responsibility to everybody?

81
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.000
And it's just don't have that felony.
Even on my social media,
I don't go hard.

82
00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:22.960
I keep it kind of neutral.
But I said something and somebody said,
well,

83
00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:27.850
the last time I checked on hill,
the economy was doing well.
And I said,

84
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.140
ah,
you can't confuse the economy with humanity.
And that's the thing.

85
00:05:32.141 --> 00:05:34.840
And that's what,
that's what people don't feel good about.

86
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.440
You can tout all the numbers,
you could talk all the numbers,

87
00:05:38.441 --> 00:05:42.820
you want a black unemployment,
all the numbers,
all the numbers.

88
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.990
But how do people feel?
You know what I'm saying?
The representative,

89
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.720
they don't feel,
don't,
they don't feel represented.
Don't,

90
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.620
they don't feel like I can rock either way,
but I'd Democrat,
Republican,

91
00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:57.370
I'm making enough money where a lot of the views of Republicans be Joe,

92
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.980
that's right up

93
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.950
<v 1>my alley.
You know what I'm saying?
How you got there,
right.
I'm ready.
Are,</v>

94
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.010
you know,
like damn,
I fucked a Republican business before this.

95
00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.083
You know what I'm saying?

96
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.810
<v 0>You don't have to say it,
but at same time,
it's the,
it's the,</v>

97
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.190
and it may not sound right to a lot of people,
but it's the human factor of it.

98
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.540
You know what I'm saying?
Like you want to feel good,
right?

99
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.660
You want to you why so many people don't know the economy is doing well because

100
00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:29.210
they don't feel good.
You know what I'm saying?
You want to celebrate,

101
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:32.000
you want to cheer,
you want to feel good about it.
And that's the whole thing.

102
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.103
Anything.

103
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.780
I believe when Obama ran like his campaign was change,

104
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.850
Donald Trump will make America great again.

105
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.300
Either one of them could have ran off each other's campaign slogan.

106
00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:50.690
Do you know after Bush Obama could have said make American great again and it

107
00:06:50.871 --> 00:06:54.170
would electrify the debase the same as change.
True.

108
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.710
They said the same fucking thing.
That would be a great thing for Obama.

109
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.970
And I'm gonna tell you one thing that kind of insulting or are we get people

110
00:07:06.201 --> 00:07:10.100
upset.
It's like you keep pushing a narrative,
make America great again.

111
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.600
Make America great again.

112
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.780
You keep pushing that as if America was so fucked up before you took office.

113
00:07:17.091 --> 00:07:20.530
And that's not the case.
Like when,
when,
when,

114
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.370
when Obama took it from Bush,

115
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.060
he was making America great again.

116
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:30.440
You're talking about a shit show and the thing that people,

117
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.200
however you took it respected and not,

118
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.510
it was never nothing laced with anger.
It was never,
it wasn't no,

119
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:43.280
Yo,
you see this mess.
Bush left me.
It was never like,
oh this motherfucker

120
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:47.050
<v 1>never no Michonne to see a new movie about Bush.
Do you see it?</v>

121
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.940
I didn't see it either.
What's it called?
Jamie?
Is it out?

122
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.280
The one with vice vice?
Yeah,
Dick Cheney and George Bush.

123
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.250
Whenever I think about say a bucket,

124
00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.200
the movie about getting shot in the face because that's the only thing that I

125
00:08:00.201 --> 00:08:03.110
want to say.
Well the,
the,

126
00:08:03.111 --> 00:08:07.160
the thing about Bush and Cheney is like that movie kind of makes it seem like

127
00:08:07.161 --> 00:08:10.640
Cheney was the guy pulling the strings and Bush was just like simple,

128
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:14.030
happy go lucky guy who they just roped into being president because he was the

129
00:08:14.031 --> 00:08:17.630
son of a president.
That's that far fetched though.
It's not far fetched at all.

130
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.200
It's not at all.
Not even remotely.
I think I actually agree with it.

131
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:24.200
When I think about Bush now,
I don't think about him in a negative way,

132
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.170
but I think about changing in a negative way.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

133
00:08:27.171 --> 00:08:29.330
I think about cheating about it.
I think about Halliburton.

134
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.990
I think about all the rebuilding of the places that we blew up,

135
00:08:32.991 --> 00:08:35.410
like all the crazy shit from Dick Cheney come from picture,

136
00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:39.740
no bid contracts that are worth billions of dollars to.
You said

137
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:43.690
<v 0>that in my the bush,
because if I ha,
I know it may sound crazy.</v>

138
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:49.140
If I had to have a pick of who I would want it to be,

139
00:08:49.721 --> 00:08:54.400
the Republican candidate it was on the Republican side was on.
I liked Jeb bush.

140
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.120
I didn't really get to know him at all.
That's it.

141
00:08:57.121 --> 00:09:01.450
That was something that I don't know that I don't know too much about,

142
00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:05.860
but I just,
I just thought that he had,

143
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.570
he was like kind of like a mama's boy.
I think he probably,
out of all kids,

144
00:09:09.571 --> 00:09:14.310
I probably think that he probably was the one that thought a little outside of

145
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:17.250
what their normal is.
I think he was a successful businessman.

146
00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:22.260
The Latino chicken if I'm not mistaken,
but I just,
I don't know.
But,

147
00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:25.970
but Bush,
I mean Trump fucked him up.
Like,
Yo,

148
00:09:25.971 --> 00:09:29.730
how do you fuck motherfuckers up with just nicknames wander to down.

149
00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.890
It felt like jab wanted to lay down.
I really do.

150
00:09:31.891 --> 00:09:36.870
I felt you didn't want to Trump put all the motherfuckers days like you were

151
00:09:36.871 --> 00:09:40.580
safe until you get your nickname.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Once you got lion,

152
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:44.940
no g g jam.
You know that motherfucker.

153
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:49.950
They rap artists.
No,
it was a smart thing he did that no one's ever done before.

154
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.930
Nobody.
That's a lot of things.
And even like even when I'm,

155
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.220
even when Obama got elected,
you know what it got?

156
00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:00.600
Obama elected was fucking Facebook and $5 contributions,

157
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:04.260
$5 donations.
He was when he was,
when?

158
00:10:04.261 --> 00:10:09.261
When when an Obama was running that he was the first person to use Facebook the

159
00:10:09.451 --> 00:10:14.250
way he did.
Really?
Oh Man.
They have so many every goddamn day.

160
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:18.860
It was Obama accident,
but he wouldn't ask for like millions.
He was just like,

161
00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.830
like a dude in the hood.
Yo,
let me hold $5.
Right.
Like,

162
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:28.200
I would get an email,
hey,
this is Barack Obama,
Yo,
let me hold $10 right?

163
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.110
And I got s and I was like,
yeah,
here go $10 right?

164
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:36.670
And then a week later he asked for fucking $20 and then he asked for 10 again

165
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:42.090
and Vinny got so bad.
Then Michelle was sent me an email.
But he just,

166
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.670
he nickeled and dimed America.

167
00:10:43.671 --> 00:10:48.671
And that's what supported his campaign and the fact that he was at right at the

168
00:10:48.871 --> 00:10:50.760
turn of,
of,
of,
uh,

169
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:55.620
of a form of media that you could use to your advantage.

170
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.110
He was the Facebook guy.
He reached people,
the Facebook,

171
00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:01.470
Donald Trump's doing the same thing through Twitter.
I can reach people.

172
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.470
Why does he tweet so much?
Why does he tweet so much everyday?

173
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:09.590
Cause he knows motherfuckers would rather pick up a phone and read a treat.

174
00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:13.530
Didn't read a newspaper 100%.
Fuck.
All I need is headlines.
