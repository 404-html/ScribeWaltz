1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.150
Sue smart to talk to regular people.
Boom.

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.360
Powerful big wave surfer.
How are you buddy?
I'm great.

3
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.930
We just got back from playing little techno hunt.
We did man.
Ah,

4
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.760
greatest thing of all time,
right?
I was just saying,

5
00:00:12.761 --> 00:00:14.440
I don't care what the price is.
It's worth it.

6
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.950
It's a bargain at twice the price or whatever it is.
Yeah.

7
00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:19.060
Where people don't know what it is.

8
00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:23.620
It's this game that it's simulates bow hunting.
So what it is is,

9
00:00:23.621 --> 00:00:28.110
is a giant screen that's made out of Kevlar and then uh,

10
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.050
it's got us like a projector projects,

11
00:00:32.051 --> 00:00:35.560
HD images of elk and deer.

12
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.300
You could set it up for a bunch of different animals,

13
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.800
but elk and deer walk across the screen and you shoot at him and it's like the

14
00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:44.770
perfect,
there's a show,
a little video of Shane Dan earlier.

15
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.150
It's a really cool man.

16
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.080
It's a perfect practice for bow hunting because one of the things about bow

17
00:00:50.081 --> 00:00:51.430
hunting is a,

18
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.120
you get nervous and the more you could do something like this,

19
00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:56.380
we just shot a perfect shot.

20
00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.240
The more you could do that over and over and over again,

21
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.170
the more it becomes ingrained in your,
your,
your nervous system,

22
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.430
grained in your muscles,
ingrained in your memory,
and then it becomes natural.

23
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.800
Yeah.
It's awesome.
Yeah,
it's pretty dope.

24
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.130
We're going to make this podcast about 15 minutes long and go back and shit.
So

25
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.390
yeah,
that's what we were actually talking about.
Cutting off the podcast.

26
00:01:16.391 --> 00:01:20.020
Short this for that.
So tell me about this movie,
man.
Yeah,

27
00:01:20.021 --> 00:01:22.900
so I'm in La for the premiere,

28
00:01:22.901 --> 00:01:27.120
the HBO Premiere of the Momentum Generation.
It's a,
it's a,
uh,

29
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.320
it's a sports documentary that Hbo and Robert Redford did.
So it's cool,
man.

30
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.940
It's really cool.
It's,
um,
it's a story about my friends and I,
we,
you know,

31
00:01:36.941 --> 00:01:40.810
we all grew up a competitive surfers and in high school we all sort of met each

32
00:01:40.811 --> 00:01:45.370
other through,
through competitions competing.
So this tells a story of how we,

33
00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:49.270
basically,
how we met,
how we grew up,
um,
and how we became friends and family.

34
00:01:49.271 --> 00:01:52.480
Basically like traveling around the world,
you know,

35
00:01:52.481 --> 00:01:55.990
together as basically like little kids with no with no chaperones on,

36
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.960
on tour around the world.
So crazy.
It's a wild story.

37
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:02.310
And pull this up to like keep this like a fist away.

38
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.020
How old were you when you first started surfing a s started surfing on a standup

39
00:02:08.021 --> 00:02:10.840
surfboard when I was five.
And when did you start traveling serve?

40
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.380
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

41
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.150
<v 0>when I was 12 I went to England for the world amateur championships.</v>

42
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.013
Wow.

43
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.030
So I was on the Hawaii Team doing this traveling surfing thing most of your

44
00:02:23.031 --> 00:02:27.860
life.
Yeah.
Wow.
It's crazy.
That is nuts man.

45
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.160
I've been,
I've been putting my surfboards in a board bag and you know,

46
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.210
walking out the door with my passport since I was 12 and going to so many

47
00:02:37.251 --> 00:02:39.650
different destinations around the world,
literally just for surfing.

48
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.200
Why do nuts does,
is such a crazy way to grow up.

49
00:02:42.201 --> 00:02:46.760
And that's a cool thing about the film is all of us had that in common.
And it's,

50
00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:50.750
it's crazy the way the story set up too because there's so many things in it

51
00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:54.650
that I didn't really realize were happening at the time.
Like,
like I came from,

52
00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.970
I came from a broken family,
alcoholic father,
you know,
kind of a radical,
um,

53
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.180
situation at home.
And then like a lot of us had like broken families.

54
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:05.380
A lot of us had that in common.

55
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.040
So we sort of have like this weird fucked up family dynamic in common.

56
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.010
So we all became sort of like our own family on the road.

57
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.530
So we were competing for a world title.

58
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.830
We're all competing and going around the world all the time,
staying together.

59
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.480
So we became best friends like this nucleus of surfers and we all just became

60
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.620
ultra clothes.

61
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.460
And then when things get got really serious with a surfing competition and there

62
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:33.760
was a lot on the line with sponsors and money and big brands coming in,

63
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.650
the shit hit the fan.
And then we started like breaking up.
It got too serious.

64
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.550
It was almost like a band who just couldn't stand each other anymore or things

65
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:46.930
got too radical or girls got in the way or money got in the way and so there was

66
00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:51.550
like this kind of like breaking up element,
you know,
throughout our group.
Wow.

67
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.520
I would imagine when you're living like that,

68
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.160
those people must be so valuable for you though.

69
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.660
People that can understand your way of life because it's their way of life too.

70
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.250
Cause like two to a regular person who commutes every day and goes to an office

71
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:10.030
and comes home.
Like your life is alien.
Yeah,
it is.

72
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.490
I still get like,

73
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.540
I still get uncomfortable when people ask me what I do for a living.
You know,

74
00:04:16.541 --> 00:04:17.071
like I'll,
I'll like,

75
00:04:17.071 --> 00:04:20.150
I'll be in like a normal random setting and some of you that,
hell yeah,

76
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.090
what do you do for a living?
And I'm like,
no,

77
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.490
do not ask me that because nobody understands.
You know?
It's like,

78
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.090
what do you tell them?
I tell them the truth,
but it's,
I just tell,

79
00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:33.700
I always tell him like it's,
it's really hard to explain,

80
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.960
but I surf for a living and do,
what the fuck is that?
Yeah.
Did they go,

81
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:41.230
how does that work?
How do you paid?
Yes.
All the time.

82
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.330
And I just got to have no idea.

83
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.010
Well you don't really compete any longer right now.
Not at all.
Right.

84
00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:51.190
Big Waves.
I do all ride big waves.
That's my focus.

85
00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:54.520
And I also write all kinds of waves.
I surf every day and you know,

86
00:04:54.521 --> 00:04:58.300
the waves don't get big that often.
Right.
When the waves are biggest,
I'm on it.

87
00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.710
Yeah.

88
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.630
For a person that like is just meeting you for the first time and doesn't

89
00:05:04.631 --> 00:05:08.950
understand surfing and it's trying to wrap their head around making a living,

90
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.130
riding the waves of the ocean.
What's like how or why,

91
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.860
but wait a minute.
No,
I went to accounting school and I,
and I don't have,

92
00:05:17.861 --> 00:05:21.310
there's not like a,
there's nothing,
I mean there's,

93
00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:23.620
there's not like another category I can really point to,
to,
to,

94
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.120
to make the point go quicker to,
there's not like,
um,
you know,

95
00:05:28.121 --> 00:05:30.610
it's like there's basketball players and football players and all of them are

96
00:05:30.611 --> 00:05:34.390
like scoring goals and getting these brand endorsements from that,

97
00:05:34.391 --> 00:05:35.640
from competition element.

98
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.540
So because I'm a free surfer who doesn't compete at all,
it's just,

99
00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:43.600
it's hard to wrap your head around,
but basically harder.
Yeah.
Basically.
I,

100
00:05:43.601 --> 00:05:46.630
you know,
I,
I,
uh,
you know,

101
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.550
I have a large surfing profile and so like I worked with a lot of brands and

102
00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:54.480
that's just the kind of,
the way it works.
It just sponsors.
Yeah.
Yeah.

103
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.890
Now this movie,
this documentary,

104
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.480
did they have footage of you guys from when you were really young?
Oh,
yeah.

105
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.520
<v 2>Okay.</v>

106
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.060
<v 0>Yeah,
they do.
Is that weird watching that stuff?
Yeah,</v>

107
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.310
very weird because we're all in our forties now.

108
00:06:06.311 --> 00:06:11.130
We all got kids and for most of us,
except for Kelly,
Kelly is still going.
You 40.

109
00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.350
Yeah,
46 years old.
I,
I,
I saw him on your show the other day.

110
00:06:14.351 --> 00:06:18.610
It was pretty classic,
but so,
so he's like a focal point in the film.
He's,

111
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.220
he's part of the momentum generation and um,
and so he,

112
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.970
there is incredible footage of him when he's,
you know,

113
00:06:24.971 --> 00:06:28.120
nine years old or 10 years old and he's in Florida,
like a little rat,

114
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.720
like a little sunburn rat.
And it's neat,
you know,
I mean,

115
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.330
I mean we all had that in common.
That's sweet.
We all grew up in,

116
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.530
in different places and then we all fell in love with surfing,
you know,

117
00:06:38.531 --> 00:06:42.930
separately.
And then we all just became super tight.
So.
Wow.
It was a great,
it's,

118
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.030
it's great.
And then now we're all like best friends again because there's no,

119
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.690
there's no points on a line or a world title on the line or like brands getting

120
00:06:49.691 --> 00:06:53.020
in the way or girls getting in the way.
We're all,
we're all,
you know.
Yeah.

121
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:57.100
We're finally growing up.
That,
I mean,

122
00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.160
that had to be strange though to be so tight and then everything sort of get

123
00:07:02.921 --> 00:07:06.970
bottleneck by the pressure.
Yeah.
And you think serving,

124
00:07:06.971 --> 00:07:09.580
how much pressure could there be?
But you know,
we're all trying to make a living,

125
00:07:09.581 --> 00:07:11.010
right?
It's like,
yeah,
you know,

126
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.080
that was our dream to like surf as much as possible and see the world.

127
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.620
And that's the only way you could do it for us.
Whenever there's competition,

128
00:07:17.621 --> 00:07:19.660
there's gotta be massive amounts of pressure.

129
00:07:19.661 --> 00:07:24.370
Whenever there's someone trying to achieve something or someone trying to rise

130
00:07:24.371 --> 00:07:27.070
to the top of a profession and you're surrounded by a bunch of you,

131
00:07:27.071 --> 00:07:28.980
but you also must have pushed each other too.

132
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:33.460
And it must have been beneficial to have people like you around as well.

133
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.730
I think it's,
it's part of,

134
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:38.660
<v 2>okay.</v>

135
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.590
<v 0>It's just,
you know,
I think it's like part of our,
our like human DNA to,
you know,</v>

136
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.200
to be naturally competitive.
So I think especially men,

137
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.960
I think we feel like we have something approved,
you know,

138
00:07:47.961 --> 00:07:50.210
like where are we stand,
like compare to the other guys.
What,

139
00:07:50.211 --> 00:07:53.650
whether it was like in the cave man days or,
or like the,
you know,
the,

140
00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.360
the first hunters where it was there for sure they were there.

141
00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.140
They were competitive to see you could bring to home,
meet for the,
for the tribe.

142
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:04.540
And then it just kept going from there.
And,
and,
and,
and now we,
we,

143
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.920
we compete with whatever we're into.
And you know,

144
00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:10.940
for us with surfing we came hyper competitive and especially me,

145
00:08:10.941 --> 00:08:15.941
like from the time I was like maybe 16 or 17 until the time I was like my mid

146
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.700
twenties I was like super competitive where I want to rip people's heads off my

147
00:08:19.701 --> 00:08:22.040
heat.
Like I would like visualize horrible,

148
00:08:22.041 --> 00:08:26.410
horrible things happening to them while I was competing against them.
Like what?

149
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:31.310
And it's fine.
It's so crazy how that's gone.
100% gone from my,

150
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:35.090
my being now,
I can't even imagine doing that.
I'm like the most relaxed,

151
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.480
non competitive person.
I,
I have no competitiveness left in my body.

152
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:39.800
Well I've only known you for what,

153
00:08:39.801 --> 00:08:44.030
four years or something like that in those years I could not imagine you having

154
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:48.320
evil thoughts towards someone who seems so chill.
I was a shit talker.

155
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.110
Where are you really?
Yeah.
I,

156
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:55.560
I remember I was surfing against this Guy Damien Hardman and,

157
00:08:55.561 --> 00:08:58.650
and he was like an Australian world champion and he was like a older generation.

158
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:00.750
We were from the young,
like new school generation.

159
00:09:00.751 --> 00:09:04.180
We are coming up and there's these established guys who didn't want to,
you know,

160
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.380
like be dethroned and there was this Guy Damien Hardman who was a bad ass

161
00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:08.280
competitive surfer,

162
00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:13.281
but he was a very like tactician conservative.

163
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:16.320
You'd never fall.
He seem like a nerd to me.
You know what I mean?

164
00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:20.220
I was like this rock kid from Hawaii and this guy was like so presentable and

165
00:09:20.221 --> 00:09:24.750
professional and I just like resented it and I was in a heat with him and he got

166
00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:25.291
priority,

167
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:30.291
which means that he had first right of wave and I just needed a tiny little

168
00:09:30.691 --> 00:09:34.470
score to win.
And he basically sat on me,
which means he uses it.

169
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:39.270
He used his priority to chase me around the lineup and sit on me and keep me

170
00:09:39.271 --> 00:09:43.260
from cutting a wave and let the time run out.
And the whole time I was like,

171
00:09:43.261 --> 00:09:46.230
you surf like a girl,
you,
you sort of feel like a little bitch.

172
00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:51.030
Like all this like totally shit talking him.
And did it work?
Did he get you?

173
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:55.350
He got me because he wrote the Dynamo.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.

174
00:09:55.351 --> 00:09:59.430
Basically cracked and started like getting emotional and he loved it.
He,
man,

175
00:09:59.431 --> 00:10:03.600
I got this guy beat.
He started to shit talk me.
He loved that.
I any,
any uh,

176
00:10:03.601 --> 00:10:04.920
he actually came up to me later and he goes,

177
00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:06.930
I love it that you're that passionate.

178
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.900
I love it that you got that site and that emotional where you just started like

179
00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:11.610
trying to like insult me.
He's like,

180
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:15.540
that's my goal when I'm in heats with people is to get them to that point.
