Trey,
my daddy Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.
Hey,

2
00:00:04.381 --> 00:00:07.830
do you guys think that the economy,
Mcgregor,
Floyd Mayweather thing is,

3
00:00:07.831 --> 00:00:12.810
is all a hoax and just a way to get Connor to have people talking about him

4
00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:16.440
until he has his next fight,
like do you think that's just a big huge thing?

5
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.190
Secrets Marketing ploy?
I think the world's flat too.

6
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.390
You think it's real?
I think me and Jill Bolte don't want to talk about,

7
00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:27.200
I think we're both red in the face.
No,
I think,
no.

8
00:00:27.201 --> 00:00:29.280
I mean do you think is a good album box is going to happen?

9
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.020
It's going to be what's going to happen?
It's going to happen.
It's so close.
No,

10
00:00:34.021 --> 00:00:37.330
I'm telling you,
this is why I don't talk to him.

11
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.170
There is a contract to a new podcast called the fighter and the man,

12
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.750
listen to me.
She's too confusing.
Time tracked.

13
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.340
Loosen the UFC and Connor verde come to an agreement right now you update them

14
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.840
because right now they're in negotiation with the Floyd Mayweather team.

15
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.050
So Floyd Mayweather team is going to want an exorbitant amount of money.

16
00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:04.890
They're very patient.

17
00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:08.250
They're going to take a long time to draw this out so they can get the best
deal.

18
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.420
But essentially the UFC and Connor have come to some sort of promotional

19
00:01:12.421 --> 00:01:16.470
agreement and now they have to figure out how much money Floyd gets and whether

20
00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:21.360
or not they want to gamble on giving him a flat rate of like a hundred million

21
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.600
dollars.
Whatever the fuck he wants.
That's a big whether that's a big like if,

22
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.360
yeah,
but he's also going to want a piece of the pie.
Correct.

23
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.540
They'll be not close to a contract yet.
They're not close,

24
00:01:30.541 --> 00:01:34.410
but they're 90% that's what I'm saying is that I feel like,
oh,
and then so,

25
00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:37.800
so what happens?
They don't,
don't pretend that you have any knowledge of this.

26
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.210
Just do everybody a favor.
I'm yourself.
That's my theory.

27
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.830
Do yourself a favor and don't let your mouth get ahead of life theory that I

28
00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:50.360
believe this is a very smart way of keeping him in align lighter.

29
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.290
That's by the way,
let me ask you this.
When,
when,
um,
Tony Ferguson,

30
00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.530
and let's just say Tony Ferguson sending Khabib fight before that and now,

31
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.680
now somebody is waiting to fight.
Conor,

32
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.390
will Conor fight those guys before he fights Floyd?
No,
definitely not.

33
00:02:09.391 --> 00:02:10.650
So then what happens to the money?

34
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.550
The money right now is in Floyd versus Connor Connor.

35
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.000
And it's just exorbitant money.
Like he might make,

36
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:21.720
who knows how many fucking millions of dollars,
maybe a hundred.
Right?

37
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.270
So that's where the real money is for Floyd.
Right?

38
00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:26.010
And this is where the real money is for Connor.

39
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.220
So for Connor to jeopardize that by fighting that fucking Russian savage or Tony

40
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.860
Ferguson who also could beat him,
I mean,
I'm not saying he's going to,

41
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.040
but it the off Tony Ferguson is a motherfucking world champion caliber fighter.

42
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.180
So is Habib.
That's a fucking killer fight.
So,

43
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.150
but we don't even know if Khabib can even make one 55 anymore,
man.
He says,

44
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.710
he says he can influence by October.
Right?
Of course there was,
he says he can,

45
00:02:53.711 --> 00:02:54.630
but he didn't make it.

46
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.690
Not only did he not make it this fucking liver shutting down and you had to go

47
00:02:57.691 --> 00:02:59.890
to the Goddamn hospital.
Did you die?
Can we use like,

48
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.150
<v 1>did you die?
Almost,
but did you die?
Did you tie it?
Hey,</v>

49
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.230
get up there and make 55 so I can fucking eat my popcorn.

50
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.500
And you fight Tony Ferguson,

51
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.610
but did you die or you did not get the fuck up there and make the weight for my

52
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:16.590
entertainment?
I just need one fight out here.
But did you die?

53
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.250
Could beam,
who's that?
Ken?
Yeah,

54
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.240
Ken.
Ken.
John,
yeah.

55
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.370
<v 2>Okay.</v>
