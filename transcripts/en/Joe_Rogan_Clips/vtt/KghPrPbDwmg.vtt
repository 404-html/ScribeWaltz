1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.350
Really below the surface like that.
People don't know what's behind the curtain.

2
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:05.700
Yeah,
no one knows about it.

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.760
And they've got like these devastating injuries that they're fighting off.

4
00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:12.470
And then competing against world class fighters with injuries.

5
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.170
He's torn ligaments and talking about Tony Ferguson,
he's like,

6
00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:20.010
it doesn't look comfortable on that leg.
No,
I mean,
he was like,
yeah,
it wasn't.

7
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:20.761
You know what?

8
00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:25.761
He went six months from catastrophic knee injury where the bone literally

9
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:29.870
separated from the ligament.
The ligament tore off the bar.
You ever see the,
the,

10
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.370
the picture of his surgery?
Oh Jamie,
shut up.
Shut up.
Pull that shit up Jane.

11
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.890
It's a crazy surgery because it's,
I'm not exaggerating,

12
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:40.470
it might be a 12 inch scar.
It's enormous.

13
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:43.860
It's like that big and it's all jagged and shit and it's just,

14
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.570
he ripped it apart.
They had an open amount of 12 months,
not even six months.

15
00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:51.500
Six months.
I mean,
yeah.
Insane.
I don't understand how that,

16
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.060
that guy doesn't clearly get the title shot.
He does.
He does.

17
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.660
We should talk about that.
Look at that.
Wow,
that's crazy.

18
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.690
And the thing is that was just from a trip he just tripped was fucking bananas.

19
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.350
Yeah.
What's the second image,
Jeremy?
Oh,

20
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:14.160
the other side way worse angle.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The um,

21
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.930
the extent of that injury,

22
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.890
the fact that he came back in six months and what's really interesting is he

23
00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:20.880
came back in six months.

24
00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:24.240
He didn't spar apparently really need to talk to him about this and I'm gonna

25
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.710
have him on with Eddie.
Um,
he didn't spar.
He just prepared.

26
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.050
Prepared.
Yeah.
He's one of Eddie's black belts.
Wow.
Really?
Yeah.
He's a black belt.

27
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.720
He should be.
I think he is.
I'm pretty sure it's fine.
I'm fine.

28
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.220
I'm pretty sure Eddie gave him his black belt after he submitted Kevin Lee.

29
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.380
He did.
Yeah.
Um,
yeah.
He's uh,
he's 10th Planet Guy.
Wow.

30
00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:50.400
That's pretty cool.
It's pretty bad ass.
He's got a nasty Darce choke probably.

31
00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:53.310
He should clearly get the title shot.
It doesn't make sense to me.

32
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.880
Even that when he came back,
he shouldn't have even gotten stripped.
In hindsight,

33
00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.410
I agree 100% and then it's like you have a copy of it.

34
00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:02.490
Who is the title holder fair and square I guess.

35
00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:03.990
But like you never beat the champion.
Well,

36
00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:06.480
he's more of a legit title holder in my opinion,

37
00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:10.500
than could be bros before Connor because he didn't ally Quinta who wasn't even

38
00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:11.850
supposed to be fighting for the title.

39
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.590
Whereas Kevin Lee is a way more like Ferguson got it from,

40
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.210
well Ferguson,
Fuck Kevin Lee,
right.
For the interim title because Connor left it.

41
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.200
But Kevin Lee prepared for Tony Ferguson.
They met,

42
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.310
they fought for the interim title and Kevin Lee is like a top contender.
Right?

43
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.780
He's a fucking tough guy.
Obviously he went five rounds.

44
00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:36.630
It could be Connor couldn't go five rounds with could be,
and he,
you know,

45
00:02:36.631 --> 00:02:39.780
he put up resistance.
It was,
it was a good fight.

46
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.220
He would never make anyone a title shot.
No.
Maybe in the same chat discussion.

47
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.960
Well,
he's fighting Kevin Lee.
If he beats Kevin Lee,
he,
that's the next cat look.

48
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.460
Ally Quinta is fucking legit.
He's very legit.
He's underrated.

49
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.020
Really underrated in my opinion.
I think he's the way he got up from Khabib,

50
00:02:58.021 --> 00:03:02.080
taken him down.
Nobody's able to do that.
He got up,
like pretty consistently,

51
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.010
took very little damage on the ground.
Wasn't,
wasn't Kebede,

52
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.840
was never able to pound him out the way he pounded out.
Connor,

53
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.040
if you go back and watch ally Quinta versus Khabib and Connor versus could be,

54
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.500
you realize how fucking good ally Quinta is just of,

55
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.860
there's nothing on the ground.
Well,
he didn't in that fight

56
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.770
<v 1>really.</v>

57
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.530
That's when Mendez took them down a two weeks notice and it was like if he

58
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:26.890
didn't,
Gas Mendez would have beat him.
It's true.
It's like he can't fight them.

59
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.640
<v 0>Well,
um,
he did very well in the ground and gets Max Holloway,</v>

60
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.790
which was early in Max's career.

61
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.050
Max was only like 21 at the time.
Yeah.
But,
uh,

62
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.520
I agree with you.

63
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.570
That's definitely his weakest part of his game and the strongest part of

64
00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:44.350
Khabib's game.

65
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.880
My point was just that ally Quinta did not get beat up on the ground like that

66
00:03:48.881 --> 00:03:50.440
did not get close to being stopped,

67
00:03:50.441 --> 00:03:53.500
went full five rounds and could be clearly won the fight.

68
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.680
But Alec went to provided resistance and provided more of a struggle than Conor

69
00:03:58.811 --> 00:03:59.070
did.

70
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.350
<v 1>I want to say thanks to some of the reasons it's holding La Quinta back from the</v>

71
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:06.220
fans,
being from them,
thinking of him as like a top is his name.
It's just not,

72
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.160
he has a name of someone who would be like in the early round of Mike Tyson's

73
00:04:09.161 --> 00:04:10.850
punch out.
You say that,
but

74
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.900
<v 0>if you started starching world champions,
nobody would give a fuck.</v>
