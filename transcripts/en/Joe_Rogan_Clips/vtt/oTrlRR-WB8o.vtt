00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
The thing about it,
man,
I talked about my book open mindedness,

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.240
which separates me from a lot of people is they go into in a daunting task in

3
00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:09.570
the task is overwhelming.

4
00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:13.140
Like when I heard the pullup Breck was 4,020 pull ups and I was talking about

5
00:00:13.141 --> 00:00:16.440
breaking this record.
People are like,
oh my God,

6
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.120
I went right to a pen and paper.
Then what are you doing?
I'm doing the math man.

7
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.030
We Tom,
but I'm open minded to the fact that okay,

8
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:26.610
if I do five pull ups in a minute for so many hours I can get some many pull ups

9
00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:28.260
in how much time they had the rest.

10
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.610
I was breaking the math down yet be open minded to the possibilities that I can

11
00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:33.444
do this.

12
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.660
Once you shut your mind down to the possibility that it can be a cheese is no

13
00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:37.494
way can happen.

14
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.940
So that's why my my eyes and my body light up about things because I know that

15
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.400
if you're in a fight you have to attack,

16
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.460
you have to keep attacking.

17
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.240
The enemy has to know he is not going to give up.

18
00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:53.580
You must break the soul or whatever the fuck is in front of you.

19
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.600
That's what I realized.
I was never breaking the soul,
anything in front of me,

20
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.720
so that's why I came with a thing called taking soles.
In my book,

21
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.220
I started to devise ways to break a soul of a human being of a,

22
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.160
of an object of,
of,
of whatever's in front of me.

23
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.050
If he keep on attacking something,

24
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.250
nothing wants to stand in front of anything that is relentless.

25
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.980
Nothing.
The taking sole part of the book is really interesting because a,

26
00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:24.810
you talked about like the,
the mind shift that you had when you were in bud's.

27
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.740
Yes sir.
That was it.
That's an intense part of the book.
It is a,

28
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.440
that's when a lot of stuff started clicking man.

29
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.470
I started watching those instructors on the side.
Could,
you know there's,

30
00:01:34.471 --> 00:01:37.800
there's three shifts.
There's eight instructors,
three shifts,

31
00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:40.050
cause you know the guy's going to do hell week.

32
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.900
They're up all day and all night for her 30 hours.

33
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.670
This is the promised land of mental hardening for me.
I love this place.

34
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.900
And you had the instructors who,
who,
you know,
they've been there,
done that.

35
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.080
Now they're instructing you.
So they do the eight hour shift they had,

36
00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:55.791
their park is on,

37
00:01:55.791 --> 00:01:59.580
it's usually cold coffee drinking their coffee and they're beating the crap out

38
00:01:59.581 --> 00:02:02.970
of us.
And when I started realize I started playing mind games and I was like,

39
00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:03.804
you know what?

40
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.900
I bet these fuckers are looking at us judging themselves about when they were

41
00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:12.480
going through hell week about,
let me see,
I'm looking at Goggins right now.

42
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.780
I was buried in him.
I was bearing that cost burden,
that fucker over there.

43
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.580
And I was like,
okay,
okay,
you're gonna Judge me,
right?

44
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.680
So I'm will do to you.
So when I started doing was I got my boat crew,

45
00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:29.100
boat crew too.
It's in the book is a great,
great story.
Said Kimra guys,

46
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.830
you can't break boat crew that you can't break broke crew too.

47
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.510
So we as winter day is Wednesday and everybody's broken.
Everybody's beat up man.

48
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.520
And like this.
I mean you start moving like a robot.

49
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.670
Everybody's like just kind of just trying to get to hell week now and your

50
00:02:41.671 --> 00:02:44.520
energy zap and they know where's days like that over the hump.

51
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.190
I love that you talked about that in the book too,
that they put it in your head.

52
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.220
We Wednesday you're going to be tight and that's nothing.
They,

53
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.870
they tell you how you're supposed to feel.
So you are feeling that way.

54
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.823
I was like,
ah,

55
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.530
don't let these motherfuckers tell you how you're supposed to feel.
No,

56
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.480
it's day one motherfucker.
This is our one.

57
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.460
So I was getting my book are all jacked up.

58
00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:05.560
I said we could take these motherfuckers souls.

59
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.330
So when they had us doing this simple thing that gods are struggling with broke

60
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:13.000
grew too.
Was this launched in the fucking bone?
You're yelling.
Yeah,

61
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:15.880
he can't fucking hurt us.
Get hurt.
Boat crew too.

62
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.770
And I looked on the instructor's faces and it looked like someone had just

63
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.670
fucked with their soul.
And I looked at my garden,
my broker,
and I said,
hey,

64
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:27.490
guess what?
Those mother fuckers aren't fucking tonight.

65
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.480
Can we own space in their fucking head?
We own space.

66
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:32.740
They're gonna think about us tonight.

67
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.330
They could think about how they callin boners.
That's right.

68
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.420
Charging and we start fueling off of that which are few fuel,

69
00:03:38.421 --> 00:03:39.370
not the fact that man,

70
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.350
it takes one second of energy to still everybody's and then you have all the

71
00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:47.860
energy you need.
It's all you need.
You need to look at someone's eyes.

72
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.470
You know how it is when you fight somebody and you broke that motherfucker.

73
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.790
He's like,
Oh God,
man,

74
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:54.610
I don't want to go back to the next round and you feel like,
my God,

75
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:58.120
I can fight all day.
I can fight all day long.

76
00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.740
That's what taking Solos is,

77
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.310
but you have to have the will to heart the courage to go that distance when

78
00:04:06.191 --> 00:04:07.630
you're exactly jacked up.

79
00:04:07.631 --> 00:04:11.230
We have nothing left to give and give more.

80
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.080
That is an interesting thing about the mind is that you can find inspiration and

81
00:04:16.081 --> 00:04:18.180
when you find inspiration,
when you get charged up,

82
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:21.660
all the sudden you have energy.
That's right.
It's right.
It's weird.

83
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.780
I talked about in the book also is about I learned how to control my adrenals.

84
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.560
If you know how you know how you get that fight or flight response when you get

85
00:04:31.561 --> 00:04:35.610
to move real quick.
And you know,
I started learning the mind a lot,

86
00:04:35.611 --> 00:04:39.480
how to get myself jacked extremely fast,

87
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.240
like in a horrible environment when everybody's miserable.

88
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.430
I learned how to really find strength in the misery when everybody's suffering.

89
00:04:47.431 --> 00:04:51.120
Everybody's all poopy pants and their mentalities down and everything.

90
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.890
I started just like my God,
this is where I shine it.

91
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.930
I started using all that misery for tons and tons of tons of drive and

92
00:05:00.391 --> 00:05:03.810
motivation to to then lead people further.

93
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.310
Cause you can get a lot of power through misery.
And once people see that,

94
00:05:08.311 --> 00:05:09.840
my God Goggins is fucking going,

95
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.220
then everybody says Roger that let me get my shit and go to.

96
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.870
So I started realizing that if you can just find strength just a little bit

97
00:05:18.871 --> 00:05:22.170
longer,
you will have a crew of people following you along the way.

98
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.060
That is another thing that no one can ever teach you does you.

99
00:05:27.061 --> 00:05:28.920
You're going to have to learn that on your own.

100
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.670
You're going to have to figure out how to pull that energy out of your mind on

101
00:05:32.671 --> 00:05:36.420
your own.
Does not this,
there's no book.
You can read the,

102
00:05:36.421 --> 00:05:39.490
all of a sudden I have it.
I've got the technique now know how to do it.
Yeah.

103
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.310
Now it's,
it's a grind that you have to start and finish on your own.

104
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.450
You have to take great pleasure in the fact that no one wants to be with a fuck

105
00:05:48.451 --> 00:05:52.040
you're at right now.
Great pleasure in that.
Most makes,
you know,

106
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.410
it has to bring a passion.
Nadia has to bring something very,

107
00:05:55.411 --> 00:05:59.660
very weird audio man.
Like you know,
people don't really understand what that is.

108
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:02.450
When you're in the worst environment possible,
the worst situation possible,

109
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.120
and everybody looking like,
God,
man,
I hope this ends.

110
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.380
And you see that time slows down and you see that you're,

111
00:06:09.381 --> 00:06:12.670
you're feeling that everybody has that look on their face like,
God,

112
00:06:12.671 --> 00:06:14.390
it's got to go.
I don't want to be anymore.
