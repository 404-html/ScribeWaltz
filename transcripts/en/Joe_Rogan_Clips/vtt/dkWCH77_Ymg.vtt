00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.200
Drive by day.
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.
You know he's a podcast.

2
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.290
Who?
Nick and Nate Diaz.
They should just get blasted.
They should.

3
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.901
They should do a,

4
00:00:08.901 --> 00:00:13.120
let's get blasted with nick and Nate Diaz and just found fucking bomb on a
table.

5
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.040
I would the size of a nuclear missile and just fire it up and just start talking

6
00:00:18.041 --> 00:00:21.040
shit about everything and have people on how people get blasted with them.

7
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.800
Get incoherent,
forget what they're talking about.

8
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.980
Just blasted radio blasted radio slash two oh nine with nick and Nate Diaz

9
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.140
lasted to,
how the fuck could they not have an episode?
Two Oh nine in Stockton.

10
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.530
They have UFC 209 is coming up and it's not in Stockton.
I Dunno.

11
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.030
That shit is unconscionable.

12
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.930
They had one opportunity ever in the history of the UFC and they should do,

13
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.250
they should have planned it like I planned episode nine 11 to be Alex Jones.

14
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.820
They should've planned episode two oh nine to be in fucking Stockton with Nick

15
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.730
and Nate Diaz.

16
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.870
I guarantee you that shit would have gotten 2 million paper view bys for sure.

17
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.520
Well they said if it just bomb UFC two oh nine and then just that where else and

18
00:01:05.951 --> 00:01:07.180
then city of stuff they fight,

19
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.870
they fight whoever you know you could get them fights.

20
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.020
Look GSPs back GSPs back GSP versus Nick Diaz is the perfect fight to make this

21
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.430
the perfect fight to make cause neither guys fought in a long time,

22
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.760
neither guys in title contention and it's a super fight.

23
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.570
This a super fight right out of the gate.
Very true.
Good point.

24
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.100
So Tucker watching him warm up man,
his striking looks really crisp,

25
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.400
giving me interesting to see and really well yeah,

26
00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:39.260
interesting to see him versus Sam.

27
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.680
But you can tell Sam's just trying to line up a shot.

28
00:01:42.681 --> 00:01:45.800
So Sam throw some hay makers.
Exactly.

29
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.720
Dude throws hey.

30
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.070
But he's at least keeping his hands up for the most part.

31
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.440
They're starting to drop again like Cilia,

32
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.420
he's like famous for putting his hands right about a waistband level and just

33
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.730
launching bricks your way.
He actually has a fist underneath that beard.

34
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.100
I really think that that is the fight.

35
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.110
I really think that Nick Diaz versus GSP is the fight because it's a super

36
00:02:14.111 --> 00:02:17.260
fight.
Both guys haven't fought in forever.

37
00:02:17.261 --> 00:02:20.890
Both guys are not ranked and it's a fight you could sell.
Yes.

38
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.410
Like right out of the gate,
there's no repercussions.

39
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.480
But there's all show a lot of money we made,

40
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.430
and I'm hearing rumors about Eddie Alvarez fight Nate Diaz,
but,
uh,

41
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.050
it was,
the reality of the rumors is I'm only hearing them online.
So I mean,

42
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.680
they might be total bullshit.
Like I could probably ask,

43
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.490
you'd have to read online.
Yeah.
I have a direct line to the UFC,

44
00:02:45.491 --> 00:02:49.600
but meanwhile I'm reading Instagram posts.
Oh,
for real.
Is this real?

45
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.900
Oh Shit.
I didn't know it was for real,

46
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.820
but I love that fight to Eddie Alvarez versus Nate Diaz.

47
00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:58.870
That's a good fucking fight.

48
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.100
<v 2>There's a lot of good fights that could be made right now.</v>
