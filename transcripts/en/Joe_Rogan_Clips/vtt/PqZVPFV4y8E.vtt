WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.650
How did you get punched?
Who,
why did that Lady Punch you?
It was a 20 year old,
uh,

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.610
bipolar girl.
Uh,
I was at levity live.

3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.450
I did a show,
came offstage when,

4
00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:16.560
into the green room for a few minutes and then came back out and I was standing

5
00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:21.510
to the left of the stage and I don't always shake hands and do all that shit

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.600
after the show.
I just don't feel it's in the job description.

7
00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:25.980
Sometimes I'll do it,
sometimes they won't.

8
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.220
But some people started coming up to me and shaking hands and taking pictures

9
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.050
and this guy approaches me,
so look like you a little bit.
Uh,

10
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.430
stands to my right and he goes,
can I get a picture that go?
Sure.

11
00:00:38.431 --> 00:00:41.430
I stand in my right.
I'm looking at him talking to him.
He's like,
yeah,

12
00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:44.430
I enjoyed the show,
but my daughter wanted a punch you in the face.

13
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.550
He didn't even finish the word face.
And I get suckered from this.

14
00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:51.840
I didn't even know she was in the fucking room all sudden Bam.
Whoa.

15
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.500
And I mean Bam.
I mean fucking,
you know,
I was,

16
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.040
I don't know if you ever get fucking suckered.
Uh,
I could feel the,

17
00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:02.250
I close and immediately,
you know,
and I looked right at him.

18
00:01:02.251 --> 00:01:05.130
This is how good my instincts were.
Even when I was in shock,
I go,

19
00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:07.970
did you just fucking set me up?
No.
It's nothing like that,
man.

20
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.210
He didn't jump in and he didn't jump in and go to his daughter.

21
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:16.680
What are you doing?
And I was kinder.
I to this day,
believe it was complicit.
Uh,

22
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.270
he was complicit in it,
but still pursuing it.
What did she don't?

23
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.990
I finally looked at her.
I go,
why,
why you fucking it,
why'd you do that?

24
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.700
Because you're mean.
She thought I was racist and sexist.
Meanwhile,

25
00:01:29.701 --> 00:01:33.300
there was a table of black people,
Dominican.
It was a very diverse crowd.

26
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.960
Absolutely loved it.
Coming into my defense after that happened,

27
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.930
nobody got offended.
Even a friend of mine who see me my in time,

28
00:01:39.931 --> 00:01:43.620
cause you won't even be in that political that night that she had Birkenstocks

29
00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:48.180
on and you know,
bipolar and,
and,
and uh,
I'm still pursuing it.

30
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.380
And the guy didn't apologize,
nothing he was,
he didn't appall it,
but he,
I said,

31
00:01:52.381 --> 00:01:56.100
you just fucking said no,
I didn't man.
And it's,
it's nothing like that.
You know,

32
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.820
I,
she said I shouldn't have brought here,
brought her here.
But you did,

33
00:01:59.821 --> 00:02:02.310
you'll weaponize your bipolar Datta is what you did.

34
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.160
I believe they sat down at the table before they left the house.

35
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.010
He knows what I did for comedy and he be,
he hated.

36
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.060
He didn't have the balls to do it himself.
You thing.
Yeah.
That's what I think.

37
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.780
Look at you.
I'm going to work,
but those kettle bells before I leave here,

38
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.230
I'm going to find this mother fucker.

39
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.740
But it gets you on a bike and gets you to burn off some energy.

40
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.410
Jesus across my penis,
my rifle coffees and love dish,
extra owned coffee.

41
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.660
It's very potent.
I want to contribute anything veterans do.
I got some bags for,

42
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.350
I'll get you some.
That's great stuff.
But yeah,

43
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:35.130
so the fucking hike you had the funniest.
This is what's funny about it.

44
00:02:35.131 --> 00:02:38.460
For years.
People tell me to,
you know,
keep your temper in check at Bubba Ba.

45
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.100
You know,
you'll fuck up the curator.
You don't Bubba,

46
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.930
I've been hearing that for years after this happened.
They're all gone.

47
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.280
Why didn't you hit her back?
Why do you I you,

48
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.140
you texted me like the next day or that night.
I can't remember.

49
00:02:49.141 --> 00:02:53.820
And you said you go,
it's made me laugh of five minutes.
You go,
Joe Goes,

50
00:02:53.821 --> 00:02:55.680
I thought y'all was gonna a quick thing.
You didn't hit her but she'll,

51
00:02:55.681 --> 00:02:57.180
cause I would have fucking leg whipped her,

52
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.720
which made me laugh so hard because she's his frail thing and if you leg whip
to,

53
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:04.180
you would have taken her legs Claire off like a helicopter blade.

54
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.080
I was belly laughing for five.
You will leg whip weapon,
this leg kicker.

55
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.960
I don't think I would have said,
okay well look scares me.

56
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.950
Well you got to kill it.
Someone Punch you.
The real problem is like someone,

57
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.630
even a garage.
I saw you on the part where you hurt your eye clip you in the pot.

58
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.770
I have a permanent dent in my face.
You can see it.
I have a permanent dent.

59
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.380
I don't,
she had a ring on.
Really?
There's a little dent there.
Yeah,

60
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.200
we had a ring on.
Someone could hit you.
The number one down.
Joe's good for you.

61
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.840
That would've been embarrassing.
You could lose your vision.

62
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.350
I mean that's 100% possible happens to people.
I had a slight concussion.

63
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.650
She really fucking caught me flooding.
I'm not shocked.

64
00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:45.070
Especially if you didn't know you.
What would you have done?
I don't know.

65
00:03:45.071 --> 00:03:46.880
I hope I wouldn't have done what I think I do.
You know,

66
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.170
cause you could lose a lot.
I know you get insurance for that.
And the Mike,

67
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.210
the real problem is when you're not thinking,

68
00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:54.310
when you get hit and then you immediately respond,

69
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.560
that's a real problem because look,

70
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.950
you've seen that video of that giant six foot five guy who punched that 11 year

71
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:03.340
old girl in the face.
She had a comment.
She,
well she definitely,

72
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.660
shit kid walked up to when it was with her and she definitely shouldn't have

73
00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:08.500
pushed him first,

74
00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:11.950
but he definitely shouldn't have punched her in the face is big giant fucking

75
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:16.840
guy.
I know with a nice shot.
You don't want,
you don't want to punch a girl.

76
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.490
You don't want to hit a girl.
And I didn't don't,

77
00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:21.670
you don't want to go into that reptilian part of your brain either.

78
00:04:21.671 --> 00:04:24.820
That just responds to being assaulted.
Oh,
that was killed.

79
00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:28.420
That's why they're dangerous.
I saw you that,

80
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.690
remember that clip years ago you were in the parking lot and the comedy store

81
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.010
arguing with some broad,
oh,

82
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:35.980
that feminist lady and I bust mean I thought you were going to,
oh,
they're all,

83
00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:37.820
I was trying to be nice to the meanest people on there.

84
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.560
I was nice to that lady for a long time until she coming to town.
What?

85
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.780
She's gonna she's gonna get hit me with her cigarette.
I'm like,
listen,

86
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.270
you're not doing anything.
I know.
I was watching it go.

87
00:04:49.271 --> 00:04:50.260
What's going to happen next?

88
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.900
But it's just so stupid that people think they can get away with things like

89
00:04:52.901 --> 00:04:54.390
that.
Worldly.

90
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.600
If you were alone in a parking lot with that girl and she punched him in the

91
00:04:58.601 --> 00:05:01.410
face like that.
What if I even fucking cracker there?

92
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.260
I said this and I've been making this point.
You want true gender equality?

93
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.590
If we had it,
I could have fucking knocked her the fuck out and everybody went,

94
00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:11.200
you know what?
She had it coming.
Yeah,
we all went home.
Well,

95
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.950
they would have been liberated.

96
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.320
You showed amazing restraint and not hitting her back cause I wasn't drinking

97
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.570
and what what if you were drinking,
I would've probably wrestled her.

98
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.360
At least cuffed her
fair slap.
Yeah.
Yeah.

99
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.680
I would have gave her from behind though.
It dirty one.
Oh,
dirty.
Yeah,

100
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.710
I would have came from here.
Do you ever see that?
You'll be sad video.

101
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.150
This is a kid,

102
00:05:34.151 --> 00:05:37.840
a black kid walking down the straight and some black neighbor and he's rapping

103
00:05:37.841 --> 00:05:41.470
Assam Shit and this black kid walks up from behind like in a wife beater and

104
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:43.870
winds up from his ass hole with an open hand.

105
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.400
It would blow your hands out if you had the headphones.
Yeah.
But I,
uh,

106
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.690
I was proud of myself and that's why I was laughing after the incident.

107
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.900
People I know who've been telling me,
you know,
you know,
cool.
It a Weber you,

108
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.760
they were all like,
yeah,
shut off.
Fuck and body slam
my entre.

109
00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:03.603
Like you shut up.

110
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.400
I was so proud of myself for once that I was the adult in the room and I,

111
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:11.360
I,
you know,

112
00:06:11.361 --> 00:06:16.361
I know in the times will limiting in wouldn't matter the circumstance if the

113
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.710
toxic masculinity,
if,
if I croaked her.
Well,

114
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.920
I don't know man.
If somebody punches you and you punch them back,

115
00:06:24.921 --> 00:06:27.860
I don't know what the fucking rules are.
Oh,
I do.
I mean,

116
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.210
she's obviously very small.

117
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.610
That would've been a real problem because she's small,

118
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.590
but you shouldn't be fucking hitting people.

119
00:06:33.591 --> 00:06:35.540
Now what you said you were working on it like,
no,

120
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:40.460
you're still in the middle of it.
Like what's going on with it?
Uh,
yes.
I,
uh,

121
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:46.070
pursuing it and they,
it's just so you can tell they don't give a fuck.

122
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.320
The Da was a woman in that county.
And now she's off the case.

123
00:06:51.321 --> 00:06:55.580
For some reason they shuffled the,
um,
but they went,
they,
you know,

124
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.410
it should be a salt.
I aggravator so,

125
00:06:57.411 --> 00:07:00.800
but of course you can't go cause if you don't get that,
I can't sue her civilly.

126
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.630
If I lost that,
it would hurt my case.

127
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.550
At least that's the logic they would tell on me.

128
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.310
So they're trying to get her with like second degree harassment and now there

129
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.190
there's a new woman on the case and she said they,

130
00:07:11.191 --> 00:07:14.710
they're making her go to anger management and uh,

131
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:18.680
cause she has mental issues and uh,
I'm not looking for money.

132
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:23.600
I just want to make an example of her.
So,
but why not pursue it as a salt?

133
00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:26.630
What's clearly assault?
I know.
Well you tell me.

134
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.070
So as your lawyers decision to not pursue it,
no.
Nobody.
First of all,

135
00:07:31.071 --> 00:07:35.430
nobody wanted to take the case because I'm fine.
Really?
Yeah.

136
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.850
They're like,
wow,
you site's not fucked up.
You're not in a wheelchair.
You're not.

137
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.370
But yeah.
Did I give the lowest credit for that much?
They're honest.

138
00:07:43.371 --> 00:07:46.250
It's all about the money,
but that's crazy.
But I found the guy,

139
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.250
this Guy Andrew [inaudible],
who was a lawyer who was a marine,

140
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.440
and I said to he,

141
00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:56.110
he contacted me and he put me in touch first with a Russian woman who,

142
00:07:56.111 --> 00:07:59.120
who took about three of my calls and she get tired because it was no money

143
00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:02.170
involved.
And he hooked me up on another guy,
uh,

144
00:08:02.171 --> 00:08:05.930
another lawyer who right now I'm dealing with.
But um,

145
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:08.790
yeah,
they will all right up front that the,

146
00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.510
if there's no money involved and you're not permanently,
you're not going to,

147
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:12.620
you know,
but I just want,

148
00:08:12.621 --> 00:08:15.870
I don't want money and this guy sort of agree with it's Andrew [inaudible].

149
00:08:15.871 --> 00:08:20.210
He's a marine.
He just wants to make an example.
She said I was racist and sexist,

150
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.380
you know.
Uh,
so I just want to make an exact,
I'm not looking for money,

151
00:08:24.381 --> 00:08:27.800
but it's her father that really pisses me off.
She's nuts.

152
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.960
How old is just broads nuts?
Like 2021 goes to a school in upstate New York.

153
00:08:32.961 --> 00:08:34.850
So she's not that,
not she lives on her own,

154
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:39.500
but it's the fucking old man that was complicit in it.

155
00:08:39.501 --> 00:08:42.020
I think he actually used her as like a weapon that night.

156
00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:45.080
It seems like it'd be way harder to prove that she was,

157
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.680
that he was complicit in it would be to,
I agree with that.
She punched,
you know,

158
00:08:48.681 --> 00:08:52.340
I agree.
Did she apologize ever?
Never.
She,
she,

159
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.980
she ran up into the lobby,
which is where you normally,

160
00:08:55.981 --> 00:08:58.050
where you take pictures with fans and she didn't,
she,
she,

161
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.950
she put her head on a table and was crying after she realized what she done or

162
00:09:01.951 --> 00:09:05.820
whatever,
you know,
they took it or like a psychiatric hospital.

163
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:10.050
So they're saying,
well,
you know,
I,
I just want to make an example of her.

164
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:14.790
That's all I,
I don't,
I'm not looking for,
but,
but uh,
you know,
that's ridiculous.

165
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.540
And the next time I will hit back,
you think,
yeah,
don't,
no,
wait a minute.

166
00:09:20.541 --> 00:09:22.740
Show you confusing me.
Now it's too little.

167
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.610
Or give me a kick that would just like hurt her ovaries.
What?

168
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:34.040
All three of them for a knee go from the lead of the pussy would be how you

169
00:09:34.261 --> 00:09:35.610
damage.
I don't want to lose my knee.

170
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.710
I just would say don't hit her,
but then you get them head around.

171
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.200
Even in the future,
if somebody does know I'm not,
I would,
I wouldn't never,
well,

172
00:09:46.201 --> 00:09:48.990
you've been proved dabbing or prove it because you haven't done it.

173
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.490
You didn't do it.
You had the ultimate opportunity.
Somebody actually hit you.

174
00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:55.070
You didn't hit him,
but it's one of my proudest moments.
Yeah,
it should.

175
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:57.350
Should be proud of that.
I've been an amazing,

176
00:09:57.351 --> 00:10:00.990
we're into it with a fan of is somebody in the audience know?
I've been in twice.
