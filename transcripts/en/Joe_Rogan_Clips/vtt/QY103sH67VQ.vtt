1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.080
Yeah,
now's the time we break out the elan Musk weed.
Oh my God.
That was crazy.

2
00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:08.880
I watched every minute we drank whiskey food,
two hours.
When I say crazy,

3
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:13.380
I mean like an amazing get journalistically.
I was awesome.

4
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.030
No,

5
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.560
it was really cool and I have to thank some of his friends that I'm friends with

6
00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:20.840
that convinced him to do that.
Yeah,

7
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.150
that was a fascinating conversation.
I thought it was nothing.
I thought so.

8
00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:31.070
We smoked a little pot.
I didn't,
I literally didn't think nothing of it.
He does.

9
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.760
That's what,
what,
what?

10
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.640
I really wanted to talk to him about what his thought process,
like what,

11
00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:42.180
what's going on.
I know something different.
It's going on in his head.
You know,

12
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.660
you ever talked to someone where you know,

13
00:00:44.661 --> 00:00:49.550
because I have children and I do like to think of people's babies that become,

14
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.720
you know what?

15
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.440
They are see them in front of me right now and there's a constant state of

16
00:00:54.441 --> 00:00:55.190
evolution,

17
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.270
but sometimes I'll run into someone that's depressingly stupid where I realized

18
00:00:59.271 --> 00:01:02.870
like,
God damn,
this guy's got a nine volt brain.
They just do.

19
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.060
Some people just do and no one wants to admit that.

20
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.690
And we're not talking about mental retardation or any sort of a disease down

21
00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:11.460
syndrome or something like that.
We're talking about people that are just toxic,

22
00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:14.960
really stupid,
and they do exist.
Just like some people have big noses,

23
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.800
some people have little noses.
So when you were talking to Elon Musk,

24
00:01:17.801 --> 00:01:20.890
did you get the sense that you were talking to like a genius?

25
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.440
What did it feel like?
I'm a chimp.
Like you're that person.

26
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.310
That's exactly what I was gonna say.

27
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.670
I am that toxically stupid person talking to this guy really wants to create

28
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.270
gigantic power stations in Australia to fix their grid and wants to shoot

29
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.990
fucking rockets into space.
And they literally let them drill under La.

30
00:01:40.991 --> 00:01:43.660
They're like,
go ahead.
What are you going to do?
We're going to drill holes.
God,

31
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.870
people are completely fascinated by him.
And they would have watched you.

32
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.230
They would've watched like a silent movie with you and him for two hours.

33
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.540
Millions of people would have watched that.
I don't know about that.

34
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.640
I didn't want to hear him talk for sure,

35
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.230
but I'm saying like anything he does is completely fascinating to people.
Well,

36
00:01:59.231 --> 00:02:02.080
he's a little Gitelman super genius.
I mean,
legitimate,

37
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.800
like when he's not full of shit is that his,
his,

38
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.830
his thought process is extraordinary.

39
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.760
But one of the things that was really clear from talking to him was that it's

40
00:02:12.761 --> 00:02:14.830
uncomfortable that his whole life,

41
00:02:14.831 --> 00:02:17.920
it's been this tornado of ideas,

42
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.780
it's be going against his head.
And he,
he's like,
you wouldn't want to be me.

43
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.520
And I'm like,
what do you mean man?
You know?
He's like,
that's it.

44
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.570
It never shuts off.
You know?
And they're like,
oh,
but he wasn't,
you know,

45
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.240
he wasn't,
woe is me.
He was being factual and he was probably,
it's probably like,

46
00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:39.570
you know how some people have a ringing in their ears?
They have Tinnitus,

47
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.570
rock concerts,
too many.
I think he's got a ring of ideas.

48
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.820
So while you and I are having this conversation,

49
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.130
I don't have a fucking thing else going on in my head.
There's nothing,

50
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.070
there's nothing else back there.
It's just you and I talking.

51
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.710
There's no fucking grand plans.

52
00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.260
I think he's like remapping civilization and trying to make a yacht.
You know,

53
00:03:00.261 --> 00:03:05.050
it's,
I'm thinking I want a burger.
That's what I'm thinking.
Yeah.
Um,
he's,

54
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.910
he's just,
you know,

55
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:11.911
just like Shaquille O'Neal is eight feet tall and some people are four feet

56
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:16.390
tall.
You know,
some people just have a brain.
I mean,
there's,
there's no,

57
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.810
there's no level playing field when it comes to anything politik performance or,

58
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.290
or mental performance.
