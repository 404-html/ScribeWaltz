1
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.750
Imagine working for a television show.
I wanted to bring this up.

2
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.640
I'm glad we just got to talking about this.

3
00:00:07.641 --> 00:00:11.090
Sam Cedar got fired yesterday.

4
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.350
I missed this so clunky and I just saw someone on Twitter.
He San deal,

5
00:00:15.351 --> 00:00:17.670
Sam Cedar who's a,
uh,

6
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.840
a heavy leftwing fellow who um,

7
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.110
was apparently in some sort of a dispute with the alt right.

8
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.920
I don't know what was going on.
I think it was about Roy Moore.

9
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.440
Like there's one of those things and um,

10
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.650
they pulled up a tweet of his and took it out of context from 2009.

11
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.430
Yeah,
sweet was,
I'm going to paraphrase it.
I don't want to fuck it up.
Jane.

12
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.880
Actually,
Jamie,
pull it up so we can find the exact tweak.

13
00:00:42.881 --> 00:00:46.750
You know that if you paraphrase it,
you're going to sound funny or than he would.

14
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.960
I don't,
it wasn't that funny road interacts.
If I was going to edit your act,

15
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.220
this is how it's saying.
Did you find it?

16
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.510
He just actually hears it one minute ago.
Here's essentially what it is.

17
00:01:01.511 --> 00:01:04.630
If you can't find her,
you got to find it and you got to find the cause.

18
00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:05.590
I don't want to fuck this up.

19
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.730
I can't tell you how many times I've told Hennigan about now this comic,

20
00:01:09.731 --> 00:01:11.260
you got to see this is a great comic.

21
00:01:11.261 --> 00:01:15.490
They do this bit and I do the bit forum and he's like,
oh,
that's funny.
And uh,

22
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.130
and then he sees them.
Oh you would do it so much better.

23
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.090
That's one of the guys got too many words.
He's using too many words.

24
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.980
Shirish guilted into retarded distracting you with the minute premise.

25
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.150
Ooh,
Ooh.
Um,
but anyway,

26
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.130
ms NBC got a swarm of emails like the,

27
00:01:36.131 --> 00:01:38.620
these people like attacked,
you know,

28
00:01:38.621 --> 00:01:41.950
these alt right fellows attacked and uh,

29
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.980
started saying that this guy had tweeted a,

30
00:01:44.981 --> 00:01:48.730
which essentially a rape joke and that we would never sponsor you and we're

31
00:01:48.731 --> 00:01:51.190
going to like contact your sponsors.
This is what he said.

32
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.780
You got to thing covering over the,
it's a picture of it cause I don't care.

33
00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.640
Oh,
oh,
go to don't care our,
he Polanski.

34
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.190
But I hope if my daughter is ever raped by an older,

35
00:02:03.191 --> 00:02:05.830
truly talented man with a great,
oh I,

36
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.390
but I hope if my daughter is ever raped,
it is by an older,

37
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.250
truly talented man with a great sense of me.

38
00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:19.240
Sons all seen mesons scenes.
I don't know.
That's what it is,
is a sin.

39
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.850
Here's the part,
here's part of the problem.
He deleted this,

40
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.360
which he regrets doing it,
but it's a part of a series of tweets.

41
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.550
All of them that criticized people support of Roman Polanski because Roman

42
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.360
Polanski had raped kids,
but he did really good films.

43
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.140
And he was like Jeff fucking discussing that is,
he was essentially saying,

44
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.240
this is a horrific way to look at this.
Like this guy raped a baby,

45
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.880
right?
He raped like a 13 year old.
Yeah.
Right.

46
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.380
So this was a part of a series of tweets all expressing this.

47
00:02:50.381 --> 00:02:51.820
And that was clearly satire.

48
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.040
And Msnbc capitulated and they fired him.
And,
uh,

49
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.570
I,
you know,
I don't him,
I know people who do know him,

50
00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:06.130
some that liked him,
you know,
and it's,
uh,
I just,
I,
it's just not,

51
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:09.010
I don't have a dog in this fight,
but that's crazy.
That's crazy.

52
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.710
If you look at what this,

53
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.070
the joke was and that the fact that he deleted it and then on top of that,
the,

54
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.210
is he apologizing for it?
No,
he's not.
He's a good,
he's not,

55
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.650
what he did was he made a video explaining what the joke was,
why he said it,

56
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.270
and the fact that it was a part of a series of tweets that he said,

57
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.230
but it doesn't matter.
Once that fucking outrage machine,

58
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.870
I was just asked if I regret my tweet from 2009,

59
00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:37.120
I regret laziness led me to delete it.

60
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.120
I would never regret criticizing rape apologists.
And I agree with that.

61
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.720
The task,
I don't know Sam Seder.
I don't either.

62
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:50.860
But I know that he could probably start a podcast and make a decent living and

63
00:03:50.861 --> 00:03:54.160
not have to work for someone who's going to fire him.
Well,
he,

64
00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:58.210
I think he has his own show minority report,
right?
Isn't that his own show?

65
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.200
Is he does that his own Internet show.
Cause that's what he loved it.
Yeah.

66
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.560
And you know,
and here's the other thing,
he isn't,

67
00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:10.561
he had a dispute more than once I believe with my good friend Sam Harris and he

68
00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:13.480
accused Sam Harris of being in the name.
Sounds familiar.

69
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.370
Sam Harrison neuroscientists.
Some people don't like that term if they don't.
Um,

70
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.230
he's an authors.
Runs,
has a podcast.
He's essentially an intellectual,
very,

71
00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:26.380
very,
very smart guy.
Like one of the smartest guys I ever have in my podcast.

72
00:04:26.381 --> 00:04:27.370
So what was their beef?

73
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.620
Sam Harris believes that all ideologies are inherently dangerous and Islam is

74
00:04:32.621 --> 00:04:37.621
very problematic and many people on the left think that when you criticize Islam

75
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.840
that your some sort of a racist,
you're akin to a racist.

76
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.530
Whereas if you criticize Christianity,
you're someone who's just not a rube,

77
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:45.470
right?

78
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.230
He gets that weird thing because of brown skin and people's desire to not be

79
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:52.630
perceived as racist.
So they go way overboard with it.

80
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.560
And Sam is what's happening with the me too thing where you go,

81
00:04:56.561 --> 00:05:01.561
I see all the benefits of people coming out and it's putting the fear enough

82
00:05:02.411 --> 00:05:06.670
fucking everybody who let me just fuck 20 years ago.
Exactly.
No,

83
00:05:06.671 --> 00:05:08.620
but I just wanted to just for Sam Sake,

84
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.290
like he's not a racist by any stretch of the imagination.

85
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.760
He doesn't like ideologies.

86
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.560
He doesn't like something that makes you think that God wants you to kill
people.

87
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.941
He doesn't want,
I mean,

88
00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:22.030
whether or not you interpret that the way the Christians do,
I mean,

89
00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:25.600
there's not a lot of people killing people over some shit from the fucking Old

90
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.850
Testament.
You know,
there's no one out there in the acting,
the rate,

91
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.690
the rate of God for people wearing two different types of cloth.
Right.

92
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.720
Because Christians are generally better off and yeah,

93
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.480
once you get a lot of fucking toys and Yay,
dismiss a lot of that,

94
00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:44.260
I should kill myself in the name of blank.
That's a fucking good point.
