1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.400
Today is day,
what are the shutdown?

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.880
26th that would just be so 800,000 American workers that work for the government

3
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.430
are not getting paid.

4
00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:15.660
So there are a month out many of these people paycheck to paycheck.

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.550
They don't have medical necessities,
they don't have food.

6
00:00:20.551 --> 00:00:24.510
People that are happening to our rationale off their,
their,
their insulin.

7
00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:27.600
If they're diabetic.
I mean I'm hearing these horror horror stories,

8
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:31.980
the lines at the airport or around the fucking block.
It's,
it's chaos.

9
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.560
And it seems like there's no end in sight.

10
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.730
And it seems like Trump is just content to,
to sell,
hold this position.

11
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.780
I think both sides are content to older position.
That seems fucking crazy to me.

12
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.200
It is crazy.
It's absolutely crazy.
If you think about it.

13
00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:48.810
And it's not just 800,000,
I don't know the exact numbers,

14
00:00:48.811 --> 00:00:51.120
but think about all the,
the contractors,

15
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.090
I think when all the government contractors,
right,
right.
You know,

16
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.930
if I can stay and I don't think they're getting paid.
Um,
and so this has,
and,

17
00:00:58.931 --> 00:01:00.990
and you know,
the administration has admitted that,
look,

18
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:05.400
we initially underestimated the impact of,
of a long term term shutdown.

19
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.580
And so they understand that.
And the Democrats,
you know,

20
00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:11.370
talk about it every minute about how this is a terrible crisis.

21
00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:15.440
And so you would think that if both sides feel that way,
uh,

22
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.900
then get something done and looked at the Democrats that Dave approved in the

23
00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:25.290
past,
recent past,
many of these Democrats voted for fencing barriers,

24
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:26.370
whatever you want to call it.
Yeah.

25
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.700
But we're lost in semantics and because the president's so hated by this,

26
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.770
you know,
this,
this,
or this group that,
you know,
they've seized on this term wall.

27
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.960
If he had started his campaign by saying we need to improve our border security

28
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.230
and,
uh,

29
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.430
find fixes to an immigration system that is both fair and secure and efficient.

30
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.500
If he had gone with that,
it's a word he bumper sticker.

31
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.380
But if he had gone with that and we'd have a different conversation right now,

32
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.020
we would,
but maybe would have a different president as well.

33
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.070
Yeah.
That's okay.
That's a good point.
You know,

34
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.670
there's something about that build that wall that's like the dopes.
We're like,

35
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.680
Whoa,
I get it,
John.
It's a wall.
Still simple.
Build a wall.
Oh yeah.

36
00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:12.530
Lucker castle.
Build a wall.
It seems so,
uh,
it's,

37
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.480
it's such a visual now.
You're right.
That's,
and that's,
you know,

38
00:02:15.481 --> 00:02:18.580
that's where I miss out.
I'm not,
yeah,
I'm way off on the,

39
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.610
in terms of being clever about politics,
but I think that,
well,

40
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.690
how to rope in rubes.
Yeah,
yeah.
I should,
I should get better at that.

41
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.670
That seems like,
but he's got that down.
Boy.

42
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.430
I didn't even know the people that voted for him.

43
00:02:32.431 --> 00:02:34.470
The people that are like real magna supporters.

44
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.530
I didn't even know the existed in the numbers.
They exist.

45
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.600
It's like he uncovered a rock.

46
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.980
Like you flipped a rock over and there was an ant colony of rubes in there.

47
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.360
And just the sheer numbers,
it's like,
whoa.
The,

48
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.290
and it's a mixed bag,
right?
It's a mixed bag.
You've got a lot of people very,

49
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:55.950
you know,
cause it's,
I,
I don't buy the idea that it's all just a bunch of,

50
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.950
you know,
uh,
uh,
crackers are a bunch of idiots.
No,
there's a,
it's a,
it's a,

51
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.960
it's a real range of people.
There's,

52
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:05.410
there's that group of people that were just tired of being told they're idiots

53
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.460
and they came out in force.
Now you can't tell,
you can't talk down to people.

54
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:12.130
This is for the Democrats can't keep talking down to people and expect at some

55
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:15.570
point they're not going to punch in the nose.
Right.
Well,
there's still now,

56
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.490
and there's still a,
there,

57
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.590
there was some congressmen recently that was talking about all the people that

58
00:03:22.591 --> 00:03:27.270
supported Trump and he was talking about them all being losers and alcoholics

59
00:03:27.271 --> 00:03:32.220
and illiterate.
And I'm like,
man,
you're talking about half the country.

60
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.250
Right?
And no lesson learned,
right?
No,
absolutely.
No self awareness.
And,

61
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.860
uh,
and that's,
you know,
that's the story of,
of,
you know,

62
00:03:40.861 --> 00:03:44.540
every election I think going forward is,
you know,
you've,
you,

63
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.560
you've got the urban centers and you've got everybody else and everybody else

64
00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:54.630
feels as if they are getting kicked in the ass.
And so I,
but,

65
00:03:54.631 --> 00:03:56.400
but yeah,
I at the same time,

66
00:03:56.401 --> 00:04:00.860
you think what we should be able to do better,
right?

67
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.070
We should,
I again,
certain policies that they've got great,

68
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.630
but every day another,
you know,

69
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.530
tweet that seems a little dysfunctional every day,
you know,

70
00:04:10.531 --> 00:04:14.880
some misstep every day,
some self inflicted wound,
um,
shouldn't happen.

71
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.620
Not in a country this size,
not,

72
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.560
not where we've got this much talent and skill and capability.

73
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.640
So I don't know what 2020 is going to bring,
but it's,

74
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.060
we got to wear it for a hell of a ride between um,
you know,

75
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.180
look at all the shit that's happening.
Yeah.

76
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.360
This seems like it might be one of the bigger moves on the chessboard though.

77
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:32.580
This government shutdown,

78
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.610
like how this gets resolved one way or another and who comes out,

79
00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:38.290
at least the,

80
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.850
the visual is the optics are that they're the winner.
Yeah.
That's,

81
00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:46.420
it seems very critical because if the Democrats win and somehow or another he

82
00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:48.580
abandons his idea for a wall,

83
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.660
abandons the billions of dollars that he's been asking for for this wall that

84
00:04:52.661 --> 00:04:53.890
gives them momentum.

85
00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:58.891
We kicked his ass with that wall and we're going to kick his ass and 2020 what

86
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.153
they're thinking that is,

87
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.670
that is exactly what they're discussing in the war room when Nancy Pelosi keeps

88
00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:07.330
them all in lockstep and she's done a good job so far of keeping the dams in

89
00:05:07.331 --> 00:05:10.510
line.
Um,
and that's why they wanted her back in.

90
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.330
At least the old guard wanted him back in because that's what she does.
Well,

91
00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:18.040
aside from fundraising,
so I,
you know,
I have a feeling that,
look,

92
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.100
he's asking for whatever,
five point $7 billion in the scheme of things.

93
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:24.100
That's a drop in the bucket and Schumer and Pelosi and a wide variety of other

94
00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:24.520
people,

95
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.940
including the previous president of all voted in the past for additional funding

96
00:05:27.941 --> 00:05:31.390
for border security,
including fencing and barriers.
But they are,

97
00:05:31.391 --> 00:05:34.720
they're not going to budge off of this.
So what the hell does that mean?

98
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:35.560
Does that mean he's,

99
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.520
he's being pushed into a corner where he has no option but to declare a national

100
00:05:39.521 --> 00:05:41.800
emergency and use funds elsewhere so that he can say,

101
00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:45.970
I finally got it done and looked at dams,
didn't do anything.
Uh,
who knows?

102
00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:47.110
But you're,
I think you're absolutely right.

103
00:05:47.111 --> 00:05:52.111
Whoever's perceived as the winner out of this ridiculous situation,

104
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.540
uh,
yeah,
they're going to beat that drum all the way to 2020.
