1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.470
I forgot.
That's the Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.490
This modernity,
I mean,

3
00:00:06.491 --> 00:00:11.491
the way human beings represents sexuality or the way sexuality is represented.

4
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.890
Um,
what's wrong with it?
Like what,
what are the,

5
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.940
what are the key things that stand out as an evolutionary biologist?
Um,

6
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.940
well let me try it and experiment with you this.
Okay.
This is,
uh,

7
00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm concerned this isn't gonna work,
but I hope,
I hope it does.

8
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.290
Even if it doesn't work,
go to work.
Okay.
Um,

9
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.260
I would like to try and experiment with you as a,
a red blooded male.

10
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.333
Okay.

11
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.520
I would like you to conjure the image in your mind of a woman who is not

12
00:00:40.991 --> 00:00:45.530
beautiful,
but it's hot.
Okay.

13
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.420
Can you do it?
Sure.
Okay.

14
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.640
Can you conjure the image of a woman who is beautiful but not hot?

15
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.520
Yes,
no problem.
No problem.
Me Either.
Um,

16
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.690
this I think actually is a window into much that is wrong with what we think

17
00:01:02.691 --> 00:01:04.700
about human sexuality.

18
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.760
I think most people,

19
00:01:07.761 --> 00:01:12.761
if you ask them without doing that little experiment to conjure a,

20
00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:18.050
or to define what,
what it is for somebody to be hot,

21
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.250
you would get answers and people would tell you that hot was sort of like the

22
00:01:22.251 --> 00:01:25.940
height of beauty,
right?
Which is very frightening.

23
00:01:25.941 --> 00:01:29.270
If that's true because hotness Wayne's with age,

24
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.360
it deteriorates.
It just can't help it.

25
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.320
The discovery that beauty actually is a different parameter tells a whole

26
00:01:38.451 --> 00:01:42.440
different story about what's going on with us.
People,

27
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.570
with men and with women.

28
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.650
And I think both men and women are confused by this.
Um,

29
00:01:48.651 --> 00:01:52.520
so if it is true,
and I,
I mean,
I know it is true.

30
00:01:52.521 --> 00:01:55.670
I can look inside my own mind and I can say that at least for some men it is

31
00:01:55.671 --> 00:01:59.240
true that beauty and hotness are almost uncorrelated.

32
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.380
There are people who have both traits,
but I,
uh,

33
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.580
I have no trouble seeing that image of a woman who was hot but not the least bit

34
00:02:07.581 --> 00:02:11.660
beautiful.
And I know lots of women who are beautiful and not hot.

35
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.100
And I also,

36
00:02:13.101 --> 00:02:17.240
if I take the category of women who are beautiful but not hot,

37
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.910
um,
there are a lot of older women in it,
right?

38
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.940
I know women in their sixties and seventies who have poise have aged gracefully.

39
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.580
They're gray as can be.
They may be wrinkled,
but if you talk to them,

40
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.450
one does have the sense I'm talking to a beautiful person,
right?
And I'm not,

41
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.370
I'm not being modeling here.

42
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.790
If it was just a simple fact that both beauty and hotness wane with age,

43
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.800
I would say so.
But it is not the case.
So what's going on?

44
00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:51.770
Why do we have these two categories and why do we assume,

45
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.840
I mean if you look at advertising,

46
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.000
you will get the message that hotness is where it's at,

47
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.920
right?
Hi.
This is the thing.
It's the only standard possible.

48
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.450
It's the only standard.

49
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:09.451
And so women are aspiring to it and then they're fighting it as it wanes and all

50
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:12.340
of this.
And um,
here,

51
00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:16.450
here's what I suspect is up because males are males.

52
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.820
They have,
I want to say they have to reproductive strategies.
Really,

53
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:24.920
they have three reproductive strategies.
And one of them is,
uh,

54
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.670
so awful that it's really just unpleasant,
even entered into the discussion.
But

55
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.340
Yup.
Yeah.
So the first reproductive strategy that men have,

56
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:40.540
the one that would generally have succeeded and not by the way we can talk about

57
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:44.520
monogamy versus polyamory and all of that at some point,
but,
uh,

58
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.030
I'm not saying anything that is inherent,
it's not inherently about monogamy.

59
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.290
The way males have typically reproduced is they have invested in their offspring

60
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.610
and the mothers of their offspring.

61
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.530
That's the Goto mechanism for reproducing as a human.
Why?

62
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.970
Because human babies are so needy that one person trying to raise them on their

63
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:11.971
own is hobbled by just the sheer difficulty of trying to manage an infant and a

64
00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:16.810
toddler while trying to accomplish the other things of being a person.

65
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.640
So let me just add here.

66
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.060
The idea that monogamy has been ubiquitous throughout human history is not

67
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.590
completely accepted,
uh,

68
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.250
but that there is good evidence for it and a lot of fronts.

69
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.930
And one of the points against it is that we remain somewhat sexually dimorphic.

70
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.280
That men are on average,
a bit taller,
a bit more muscle,
much more muscular.

71
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.300
Um,

72
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.300
but that we are so much less sexually dimorphic then even our ancestors,

73
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.320
um,
beef in more recent times then when we were,

74
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.010
we shouldn't read most recent common ancestor with chimps that we are moving

75
00:04:51.011 --> 00:04:54.570
towards a more monogamous situation.
So just I think,

76
00:04:54.571 --> 00:04:56.350
I think you said something that was unclear at the beginning.

77
00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.600
There has been a lot of polygyny where one male has multiple females in human

78
00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:06.180
history.
Probably the majority of human cultures have been polygynous.
Yes,

79
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.300
majority of people on Earth today belong to cultures that are at least nominally

80
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.201
monogamous.

81
00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:15.010
And we should talk about what that shift is and what it means to us and what's

82
00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:16.060
desirable and all of that.

83
00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:21.061
But the basic point that human babies are so expensive and difficult to raise

84
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.590
that,
um,
you need a team to do it.
And you know,

85
00:05:26.591 --> 00:05:31.591
in part this is a chicken and egg question is not a good term because it's quite

86
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:37.090
clear which came first.
But,
um,
the,
this is a situation where the,

87
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.390
when you have a team,
you can also afford to have a baby that's more needy.

88
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.850
And there there's nothing good about a needy baby,

89
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.280
but there is something good about what you can get.

90
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.350
If you can tolerate a needy baby,

91
00:05:47.351 --> 00:05:52.060
you can get a baby that's a lot more nuanced when it grows up.
So males,

92
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.470
I have traditionally invested in offspring,
um,

93
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.950
but a male who is investing in their offspring,

94
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.020
should they happen on an opportunity in which a female who is fertile and

95
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:07.520
capable of producing an offspring,

96
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.550
it does not require commitment from them in order to have sex.

97
00:06:10.551 --> 00:06:12.080
That's an evolutionary bargain.

98
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.690
A male who can either convince a female or finds a female who's willing to

99
00:06:17.691 --> 00:06:22.490
produce a baby but not expect any support in return.
That's such a power.

100
00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:24.320
It's like winning the lottery evolutionarily.

101
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.770
So it would have almost never happened in history because women,

102
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.970
because babies are so expensive,
are wired to avoid this like the plague.

103
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.020
You don't want to get stuck raising a baby on your own if you could,

104
00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:40.370
through committing to somebody,
get a partner in raising an offspring.

105
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.820
So how does birth control factor into the,
well,
we'll get there in a second,

106
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:46.190
but let's just get the two strategies on the table.

107
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.370
Males in general have succeeded reproductively by investing in their offspring

108
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:54.320
and their offsprings.

109
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:59.330
Mothers when they have the opportunity to produce offspring with no commitment,

110
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.660
they have a hard time resisting that opportunity because it's such an

111
00:07:02.661 --> 00:07:03.860
evolutionary win.

112
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.920
But that doesn't mean it would have been very common in history because females

113
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.840
would avoid it.
So my,

114
00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:12.660
I can't look away from hot is about that second strategy,
right?

115
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:18.100
So hot is this channel that men can,

116
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.860
they,
they are wired in such a way that they actually,

117
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.650
we've been robbed of every useful term.

118
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.920
They are triggered by the sight of a woman who is broadcasting hotness.

119
00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.780
All right.
And,
um,
so anyway,
the,

120
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:41.030
the thing that I think is most important about this is we now live in a culture

121
00:07:41.031 --> 00:07:46.031
where we have advertisers essentially creating a kind of insecurity because

122
00:07:48.141 --> 00:07:51.020
insecurity causes people to spend money they otherwise wouldn't.

123
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:56.560
That insecurity has women trying to capture male attention by broadcasting

124
00:07:57.321 --> 00:08:01.610
hotness,
which of course works because men have a hard time ignoring hotness.

125
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:06.640
But what I think women often don't understand is that getting a man's attention

126
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:12.820
by broadcasting hotness has him in the frame of mind of this second reproductive

127
00:08:12.861 --> 00:08:13.694
strategy.

128
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:17.330
And it is actually counterproductive to getting his attention for the first

129
00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:21.260
reproductive strategy because men,
um,

130
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.560
have historically,
this is by the way,

131
00:08:24.561 --> 00:08:27.340
this is where I'm going to get in huge trouble with people because this is going

132
00:08:27.341 --> 00:08:29.120
to sound like an accusation.
Really.

133
00:08:29.121 --> 00:08:32.540
I'm just trying to describe what has been and then we can talk about what we

134
00:08:32.541 --> 00:08:34.370
should do about it.
But,
um,

135
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:40.360
a woman who values herself highly in reproductive terms will not leap on,

136
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.510
uh,
a sexual opportunity just because it's available.

137
00:08:47.511 --> 00:08:50.570
Because what's at stake is so great.
Historically for women,

138
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:53.120
this is not true anymore because of birth control.

139
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:58.230
But historically it would be true that a sexual interaction is basically baby

140
00:08:58.231 --> 00:09:02.640
roulette and baby roulette is a dangerous game to play.
So,

141
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:08.120
and so we get at some of what's true underneath the stereotype of the Madonna

142
00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:11.910
whore dichotomy,
uh,

143
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:17.210
that neither of those words is quite right because no one wants a Madonna.

144
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.590
No one wants a virgin is a life partner,
right?

145
00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:23.010
You want it to have a vibrant sexual relationship with your life partner,

146
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.790
but the,
are you triggering the hotness?

147
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:31.050
Can I get a baby out of you and never see it?
Um,

148
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:36.720
strategy and men or are you triggering the,
Oh my God,
you're gorgeous.

149
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:40.380
And I feel like we could do this together.
I hate to interrupt you,

150
00:09:40.381 --> 00:09:43.620
but you got to pull this thing close to,
sorry,
just move that sucker around.

151
00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:45.870
So it's so it's comfortable where you're sitting.
How about that?

152
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:49.860
It's very different.
It sounds okay in our ears,
but it's very sick.
Tenancy audio.

153
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:54.450
Sorry.
Perfect nugget.
So,
so anyway,

154
00:09:54.451 --> 00:09:59.270
then the Madonna whore complex,
which is this famous thing,
isn't it?

155
00:09:59.271 --> 00:10:04.000
The paradox that we are led to believe men are interested in,
you know,

156
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:08.580
as Heather points out,
Madonna and whore or the wrong terms,
they're very charged,

157
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:13.610
but men are interested in both of these reproductive strategies,

158
00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:15.480
but they are not interested.

159
00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:18.960
They're not paradoxically searching for them in the same individual.

160
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:20.380
<v 2>Okay.</v>
