WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.100
I've always tried to follow some thing as opposed to thinking of his training.

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.920
Even that,
even the word training tastes like homework,
right.

3
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.370
So I've always tried to,

4
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.610
I was running for a long period of time.

5
00:00:15.611 --> 00:00:20.370
She's about seven years.
When I jogged and ran and I decided on the road,

6
00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:23.670
I'll run across every bridge in America that we toured the root.

7
00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:27.970
So I probably 1520 different bridges,
Golden Gate Brooklyn.

8
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.390
And that's where I rent.
No,

9
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:33.390
I did smoke a joint and run the New York City Marathon

10
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.170
and I came in and right behind the wheelchairs in the back.
Okay,

11
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.900
well some folks need the ribbon and they need to see the clock and everybody

12
00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:47.030
clapping.
And then there's some folks you know who just just wondering.

13
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.440
You did okay.
And they had took down the clock,

14
00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:53.400
but the line was still there on the scene meant in central park,

15
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.650
hopped over the line,
got the picture airborne,
went home,
took a nap.

16
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.200
And that night I went out and got drunk on Tequila.

17
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.300
How long did it take you to finish the marathon?
About five and a half hour.

18
00:01:04.301 --> 00:01:06.810
So that's not bad.
That's very good.
It's better than Berg question.

19
00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:10.610
Now let's come on.
Let's be complimentary.
It's the worst.
It's definitely,

20
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.230
yes.
That's about the absolute worst that it was the winter.
Do It our 20,

21
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.990
I think they get it in around two hours.

22
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.820
Like two hours in seven seconds.
I think they're trying to break two hours.

23
00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:26.640
Isn't that what's going on?
Yeah.
Someone's trying to break two hours.
So,

24
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.650
but that's what I did for a,
a period of time,
you know,

25
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.500
keep going,
kayaking,
you know,

26
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.580
so you just always been involved in physical activities that were fun in the

27
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.670
early nineties kayaking was illegal in Manhattan.
Okay.

28
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.850
Because it was dirty water and people would get trundled over under the ferry

29
00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:48.030
boats.
Oh God.

30
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.740
So what we did is we cut a hole in the fence next to the 14th street sanitation

31
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.620
department over by the,
uh,
west side highway.

32
00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:00.600
Y'All know what I'm talking about?
If you're from there.

33
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.330
And we did it exactly like movie style,

34
00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:08.331
like a greatest scape where we fitted the fence back with duck tape and we would

35
00:02:08.641 --> 00:02:12.840
drag our kayaks from union square west all the way down 14th street.

36
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.620
Okay.
And you pick up your provisions for it.
All right?

37
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.990
You got to get a your bagels.
She gotta get shit.
So what,

38
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.590
you know like this,
you got to get something to drink,
get some Gatorade,
you know,

39
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.760
not to drink the gate arrays.
So you have something to Wiz in serious.

40
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.420
And we'd get the girlfriends.
Okay.

41
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.200
To wait up is in the meatpacking district right there.
It's dead silent.

42
00:02:37.201 --> 00:02:39.960
It was a ghost town then there was not hip hop.
It was not going,

43
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.430
which is what it's doing now.
And he'd go to shopping with,

44
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:48.420
your old lady had said Stella Mccartney down there now at Benton is a ghost
town.

45
00:02:48.421 --> 00:02:52.530
That it was great,
scary,
dangerous.
And one girlfriend,

46
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.150
which I gotta be careful of names,
they're all married now.

47
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.580
How'd you manage it?
Mine.
Karen

48
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.620
would always go north and wait around because if the cops come,

49
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.410
they would step out.
We would see them.
And whatever,

50
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.720
and we would sneak our bolts through the hole in the fence into the river,

51
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.520
right,
where solely landed his plane right there.
All right.

52
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.920
And then girls would come at jumping to boats and we would take off more than

53
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:28.000
two or three times.
Local PD would show going,
hey,
what do,
what?

54
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:31.690
Are you going to touch that water back then?
No,
that was,
that was death.

55
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.340
Inky black whore or death like this.
Did you have a Dunkin it accidentally?

56
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.610
No,
not in,
not in that river particular,

57
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.720
but we started a number of the trips today.

58
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.610
There's probably six different kayak clubs that you can jump.

59
00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:52.870
Manhattan Kayak Club and Brooklyn clock.
Many,
many.

60
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.710
Now the boomers with senses of humor figured it all out.
All right.

61
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.470
And we would go,
Geez,
we started,

62
00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:04.471
Trish would go at midnight under the Verrazano Bridge in the winter.

63
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.690
All right.
And you were dry shoots or something.
You know,
you're a long,

64
00:04:09.691 --> 00:04:13.150
a long Johns inside of a dry sheet like this.
And don't get me wrong,

65
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.850
I would be the DJ,
I have a,
um,

66
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.940
a a tape player and I would bungee to take player like this and everybody would

67
00:04:21.941 --> 00:04:25.870
have,
this is a primitive times know it's 19,
early nineties.
You know,
I just,

68
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.100
and we would have a little little microphones in the earpieces that you use on

69
00:04:30.101 --> 00:04:34.540
motorcycles back then.
So you have communications from boat to boat.
Oh Wow.

70
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.660
And I would put mine on the tape player and I'd be the Tj.

71
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.850
Oh yeah.
And we'd listen to the ball game late at night sometimes,
you know,

72
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.210
and you'd hear laughing all,
you couldn't see anybody in the swells.

73
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.620
And we go under the same bridge that John Travolta sits and looks at with the

74
00:04:50.621 --> 00:04:53.730
girlfriend in Saturday night fever,
same bridge.

75
00:04:53.731 --> 00:04:57.330
And know that a woody Allen in Manhattan,
it looks at,
you know,

76
00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.180
you have a wonderful listen on the other size,

77
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.180
terrible imitation of either of them.
And we'd float under their full moon,

78
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.290
midnight February,
snow drifting like this.

79
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.900
And since it was illegal to do it.

80
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.760
We had a buddy who owned a plumbing company in Brooklyn and he would bring his

81
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.040
truck and park it right off a Coney island.

82
00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:22.240
You're still well having avenue where the Ferris wheel is and he would blink his

83
00:05:22.241 --> 00:05:26.440
lights,
allied forces style blink,
blink like that,

84
00:05:26.441 --> 00:05:30.580
and we'd be about a quarter mile off having come from under the Verrazano
Bridge.

85
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.350
The winter,
we'd see those lights blinking.
Nowhere to turn left.
He started,

86
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.690
do you even want to hear this?
Yes.
Okay.

87
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.140
We'd have to make the left and we'd wait for this swells like can you give us

88
00:05:44.141 --> 00:05:47.800
another blank?
When all was clear and jazz,

89
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.390
beat ass all a quarter mile of row,
row,
row,
catch the wave,

90
00:05:52.391 --> 00:05:54.430
get out of the boat.
You know,

91
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.310
silently drag it all the way the beach.
Okay.

92
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.120
Like you see in every war movie.
All right.
Otherwise just about it.
I don't know.

93
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:03.890
$200 fine or something like this.

94
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.480
And we would put the boats big two person kayaks into the back of the plumbing

95
00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:09.680
truck and onto the top of it,

96
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.550
drive it back to the coffee shop on Union Square West.

97
00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:17.270
It's very well known like that and get drunk with pretty girls and tell them

98
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:21.140
about adventure stories.
And all this was going on while you were,

99
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.190
you were air quotes David Lee Roth.
I mean,
this is the nineties.

100
00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:26.090
You were fucking huge.

101
00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:29.990
You're still a rock star and you're going through polluted water in a fucking

102
00:06:29.991 --> 00:06:34.580
Kayak,
hide from the cops with a tape player and uh,

103
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.380
and uh,
some sort of jury rigged,
uh,
microphones.

104
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:43.130
So some of the best places that I went rock climbing,
uh,

105
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.520
we're on walls of hotels in Europe.
We'd toss,

106
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.590
toss a rope out the third floor of a bed and breakfast in San Sebastian in

107
00:06:51.591 --> 00:06:52.071
Spain.

108
00:06:52.071 --> 00:06:56.990
That's covered from flagstone with flagstone from the 14 hundreds like that.

109
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.320
And then Yo,
Yo,
you know,
one guy would stay up,

110
00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:04.460
watch TV and work the ballet and you can climb up the outside.
You know,

111
00:07:04.461 --> 00:07:06.560
it's Jesus Christ,
hardcore jollies.

112
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.620
So when you were doing this all around the same time?
Oh yeah.

113
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:14.810
When my bicycles with me,
I'm an outdoors is in the blood.

114
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.740
You know,
it's part of growing up without any real things.

115
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:23.360
My Dad was a student,
so,
uh,
take this stick for you.

116
00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:25.850
It'll be a bow for me.
It'll be a baton.
