WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.810
Yeah.
You were one of the,
you mean you,

2
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.980
you were one of the people that I cite all the time for.

3
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:08.670
Why that stupid reason that the 12 to six elbow,

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.510
you're the one that explained it to me.
I couldn't,

5
00:00:10.511 --> 00:00:14.400
I couldn't believe what you're telling me was true at the reason 12 to six

6
00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:17.470
elbows were illegal.
Well,
just tell the story.
Uh,

7
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.040
the truth of the stories back.

8
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.220
There's so many stories about rules and how they came about and you know,

9
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.670
there's guys claiming things and it's like,
really?
Okay,

10
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.330
I have paperwork that shows how the war,

11
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.020
how things came out and at what time it was.

12
00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:40.410
And I still have my computers that I have things written on that we went over

13
00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:43.560
stuff.
But you have computers from the 90s,
dude,
I still have no,

14
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:47.430
I've got floppy disk.
No,
you don't swear to God.
He'd do.
Unbelievable.

15
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.800
How much can a floppy,
this hold not even like a magnet,
right?

16
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.250
Nothing holds a couple of pages of a document.

17
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.190
But you remember when the floppy disk went away,
everybody panicked.
Like,

18
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.390
what are you doing?
You're fucking taken away.
The floppy disk.
That's how rage is.

19
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.150
What are you going to put stuff on that?
When Matt got rid of the floppy disk,

20
00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:09.690
I remember people like these guys are assholes,
what are they thinking?

21
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.590
But anyways,
when,
when the unified rules,
you know,

22
00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:18.090
what happened was everyone looks at the UFC and says,

23
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.960
oh well you know,

24
00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:23.961
when the UFC went to the first show that was done in New Jersey was the IFC Paul

25
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.500
Smith's show.
It was done in September,

26
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.250
I want to say of 1999 okay.

27
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:36.130
And the UFC went there in November of 1999 and,

28
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.900
and yet you have to go back and understand the history of what was going on.

29
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.270
And you know,

30
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.110
this is where I have my issues with people that try to change history and

31
00:01:46.111 --> 00:01:47.070
rewrite things.

32
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:52.071
And what was going on was seven to 400 payment group at the time owned the UFC.

33
00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:58.370
That's who you were working,
Bob Meyrowitz Meyrowitz and Mclaren Campbell.

34
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.000
Mclaren was long gone,
you know,
and I love I then by 99 oh my God,
yes.
You know,

35
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:05.100
and you talked to the day when I came around in [inaudible] 97 yeah.

36
00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:07.680
Well I think he hired you.
Yeah.
And you know,

37
00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:11.700
he did some stuff and he comes up with a,
you know,
on the cocreator the UFC.

38
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.430
You know what,
let me just ask one question.
If you're the cocreator,

39
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.760
how come you never owned one bit of it doesn't make sense.

40
00:02:20.761 --> 00:02:25.660
Doesn't out Campbell Mclaren.
Yes.
Dare you.
You know what?
I'm tired of.

41
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.410
Why lie he did things and I will,

42
00:02:28.411 --> 00:02:33.411
I will absolutely give him credit for what he did because he was the reason that

43
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.710
it actually made it to pay per view because art Davey had gone to everyone.

44
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.920
Prime ticket at the time was a paper view provider because the paper view world

45
00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:48.880
back then was about 15 million in the u s it's not like it is now.
You know,
you,

46
00:02:48.881 --> 00:02:51.810
you were limited,
but you know,
prime ticket was one,

47
00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:56.460
HBO was another and he had gone to all those and they all turn,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

48
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.260
And there was this one company,

49
00:02:59.261 --> 00:03:04.261
semaphore entertainment group out of New York that did rock and roll shows and

50
00:03:04.661 --> 00:03:06.010
they did one sporting event.

51
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.570
It was Martina Navratilova against Jimmy Connors and tennis.

52
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.920
Oh Wow.

53
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:15.880
You make a remake of the Billie Jean King Bobby Riggs thing.

54
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.960
Wow,
I remember that.
Uh Huh.
That's crazy.
That was them.

55
00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:21.040
I didn't know that was [inaudible].

56
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.420
That was the only sporting thing they'd ever done before the UFC.
But they were,

57
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.180
they were looking for something that they could rerun and,

58
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.300
and make happen again and again.

59
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.450
And Campbell looked at what art brought to him and said,

60
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.550
I think this could be that thing.

61
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.740
And Horry and came up with the idea Horian Gracie,
negative,
negative,
not true.

62
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:43.130
He says he came up with the idea of,

63
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.380
are you saying you calling out Horian Gracie?
He not calling

64
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.020
big John doesn't fuck around.
Look it whore.
Horry Horry and had,

65
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:56.980
you know his thing and I love,
you know what,
I fell in love with what they did.

66
00:03:56.981 --> 00:04:01.120
That's how I got involved.
Right.
But horian are,

67
00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:04.180
Davey went to Horian because he needed validity.

68
00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:09.181
He needed somebody to give actual value and some credence to what he was trying

69
00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:14.200
to do because he went to Horian off of,
uh,
uh,

70
00:04:14.201 --> 00:04:17.980
there was an article in Playboy magazine bad,
you know,

71
00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:20.890
and it was about Horian and you know,
at this guy,

72
00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:22.960
this family that would fight anybody.
And you know,

73
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.080
Chad was a bad article that would called back.

74
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.960
That was the actual title B,

75
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:32.620
a d across two pages bad.
Ah,
was the,

76
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.640
I remember we had the article,
I don't remember that part about it,
but it was,

77
00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:39.680
it was basically they were offering like a lot of money to fight anybody,
right.

78
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.980
Well,
it was the whole thing of the hundred thousand dollars,

79
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.930
but he didn't have $100,000,
you know,
and so it was,
well,
if you bring $100,000,

80
00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:49.090
I'll put up a hundred.
No one's bringing $100,000.

81
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.980
So just more like a publicity stunt.
Yeah,
they did.

82
00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:57.220
Obviously they had the Gracie challenge before that and they did all the Gracie

83
00:04:57.221 --> 00:04:59.650
in action tapes that we had all seen.
Yup.

84
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.610
And he'd see all these karate masters it down,
strangled,
you know,
and that was,

85
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.210
that was the thing that I loved the fact when,
you know,

86
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.610
I can go through the whole thing of how I met Horian but when I met him there

87
00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:15.870
was never anything about,
well you know,
we,

88
00:05:15.871 --> 00:05:19.210
we would do this and that situation but we can't do that cause will hurt you or

89
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.240
something like that was what happened in a lot of martial arts all,

90
00:05:22.241 --> 00:05:24.760
well we can't do that because that would really,
that will hurt you,

91
00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:28.720
that will kill you.
And he was like,
let's do it right every time.

92
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.600
And that's what I fell in love with.
It's like,
hey,
they're not phony.

93
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:32.560
They're real.
Right.

94
00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.030
The first time I ever did anything with them all hoists Gracie arm barred me and

95
00:05:37.031 --> 00:05:40.690
I went,
how did you do that?
And I just fell in love with it.

96
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.110
A lot of people said that about Hoists Gracie,
how?
Yeah.

97
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.160
Those early days of the UFC was,
boy,
I mean you want to talk about,

98
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.190
I mean he really played it out perfectly because it really was the best version

99
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.190
of explaining Jujitsu.
Like did how,
how do you show the effectiveness?

100
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.040
Did you just say,
well here's what you do.

101
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.250
You'll lock some dudes in a cage with no rules,

102
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.110
guides bigger than him and he's wearing his geeky.
So he looks,

103
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.510
he's the only one that looks like,
like what we think of as a martial artist,

104
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.930
right?
And you get these guys,
everyone else looks like big old street thugs.

105
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.380
The jacked up on steroids.
They're giant and they're running after him.

106
00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:23.381
And we always would think of like Bruce Lee and these martial artists who it

107
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.890
technique over size and they would beat all these people,
but in the real world,

108
00:06:27.891 --> 00:06:31.850
that shit didn't work.
Nope.
Just didn't work.
Bigger guys always fucked you up.

109
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.510
They were heavier.
You hit him.
It didn't work.
It bounced off of them.

110
00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:37.260
That got you on the ground.
They punched your face in.

111
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.440
But all of a sudden there was this little guy who wasn't little,
but you know,

112
00:06:40.441 --> 00:06:43.100
it was 175 pounds in comparison to the rest of the people.

113
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:48.050
He was fairly small and he's tapping guys at triangles off his back and arm bar

114
00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:52.250
and people and,
and everybody with greatest,
greatest infomercial ever.

115
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.140
It was the greatest.
Exactly.
Got me on board.
I mean to me and everybody else,

116
00:06:57.141 --> 00:07:00.650
man,
all these people that like me came from a striking background.

117
00:07:00.651 --> 00:07:04.280
I was like Holy Shit.
And that's like,
this is crazy.
That's where I look at.

118
00:07:04.281 --> 00:07:09.281
Horian was brilliant because he listened to what art said and goes and look at

119
00:07:09.961 --> 00:07:11.960
art.
So whose idea was it?
It was art.

120
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.450
It was arts idea to have a bunch of guys fight.
Absolutely.

121
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.210
100% well how much did art,

122
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.870
how much of the art owner that he owned a,

123
00:07:20.871 --> 00:07:24.260
I want to say basically 25% 20 when they sold it to,

124
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.600
cause they had [inaudible] he got a piece of that.
Oh well no,
he was,
he was gone.

125
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:29.570
Gone before that.

126
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:34.630
You've got to figure when there was two there was wow promotions and wild

127
00:07:35.041 --> 00:07:40.041
promotions came from war of the worlds because art had named the whole

128
00:07:40.551 --> 00:07:43.570
competition or the world.
Ah,

129
00:07:43.571 --> 00:07:46.790
and then Semafore entertainment group changed it to the ultimate fighter.

130
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.630
I vaguely remember that whole thing.

131
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:53.650
Guy Named Michael Abrams is the one that named it.
So it when,

132
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.550
when art had with Horry on,

133
00:07:55.551 --> 00:08:00.551
he gave Horian 25% he had 25% and Bob Myerwitz own 50% because of putting it on

134
00:08:00.831 --> 00:08:02.450
paper view.
Ah,

135
00:08:02.451 --> 00:08:07.451
so you had while promotions owning 50% seven or 400 tamer group owning 50% and

136
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:08.871
actually wow.

137
00:08:08.871 --> 00:08:13.750
Owned a little bit less because they had brought together investors and they

138
00:08:13.751 --> 00:08:18.180
were trying to get $250,000 and they got somewhere around 115,000 hundred

139
00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:22.520
$12,000 of investment that they put up cause that was going to be part of the

140
00:08:22.521 --> 00:08:25.850
money for the people that we're competing in it.
It's crazy.

141
00:08:25.851 --> 00:08:27.440
When you think about what it is now,
