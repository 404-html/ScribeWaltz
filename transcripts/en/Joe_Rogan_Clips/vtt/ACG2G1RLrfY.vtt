WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.410
Big fight with GSP.
Oh yeah.
That's,

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.430
that's why that took place because you had that belt.
Yeah.
You know,
I mean,

3
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.400
I mean joint fight,
George beat me fair and square that night.
But uh,

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.030
there was a lot going on going into that camp that,
uh,
the final week.

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.610
And again,
I never said anything at the time because God blessed George and,

6
00:00:18.611 --> 00:00:21.690
and he's a great guy and I respect the hell out of George.
I really do.

7
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.520
How can you not,
you know,
I mean,

8
00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:26.190
I know I talked all that shit leading into the five,

9
00:00:26.191 --> 00:00:29.610
but that was just me having a laugh,
you know?
I was literally having fun with it.

10
00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:33.720
You know?
No ill will towards yours seem like you're enjoying it.
Just having fun,

11
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.780
just busting balls.
You know what I mean?
I think George is incredible.

12
00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:39.150
I think George is the consummate professional.

13
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.570
He's a inspiration to all the Sperry martial artists out there.

14
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.230
If there's one man you can model your career on the way Twain's the way he looks

15
00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:50.400
after his body,
the way cross trains judge Jpa will be that man,
you know,

16
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.390
he's an inspiration to myself,
you know,
so,
uh,

17
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.870
nothing but the greatest of respect.

18
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.890
But people as we said at the star of the show that doesn't sell.

19
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.680
People don't want to see that.
People don't want to see that.

20
00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:06.140
So I'll play the bad guy.
I've been portrayed as the bad guy my entire career,

21
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.370
you know,
by the UFC,
the editing,
you know,

22
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.760
I've fallen foul to some creative editing.

23
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.210
I've fallen foul to my own mouth as well at times.
So,
you know,
come on.
You know,

24
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.430
I'm my own worst enemy as well.
But um,
the week before the phone,
yeah,
we,

25
00:01:21.431 --> 00:01:26.040
before the fight,
uh,
that the best training camp and my life,
you know,
uh,

26
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.980
sounds braggy,
but knocking out multiple sparring partners,
not on purpose.

27
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.880
It just felt incredible.
Absolutely incredible.

28
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.760
Final sparring session,

29
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.340
we had my protein and they'd flown in for a photo shoot or someone else there

30
00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:43.710
for a photo shoot.
The Gym's absolutely packed.

31
00:01:43.711 --> 00:01:47.550
And we got some guys in their aspiring me and um,
you know,

32
00:01:47.551 --> 00:01:50.450
everybody wants to be the guy,
you know,
the,
the,

33
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.050
the guests to take down or whatever or get to submission on the guide.
That's,

34
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.140
you know,
that's how it is.

35
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.590
That's why I don't like go into too many MMA gyms when I was fine because every

36
00:01:58.591 --> 00:02:02.340
time you walk in you have a target on your back.
Anyway,
it was the final round.

37
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.420
We don't five rounds,

38
00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:07.650
it was the Friday before the fight and this guy shoots in,

39
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.110
shoot a double leg wounds.
We all the way across the octagon,

40
00:02:10.111 --> 00:02:13.230
like his life depended on,
it,
depended on it,
picked me up,

41
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.560
slammed me down and his shoulders went,
Gosh,
Ryan to my ribs.

42
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.880
And I felt it instantly.
Just all the cartilage is tor completely.

43
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.260
And uh,
I just started swearing and screaming,
fuck fucking,

44
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.980
you know,
cause I knew,
I knew I went a saw a doctor and Warner and a,
yeah,

45
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.010
it wasn't good.
So I was,

46
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.300
I got treatment every day and I was having Nice on me and all that type of
stuff.

47
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.440
Uh,
but,
uh,
it wasn't working.
So

48
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.280
what we came up with,
whichever,
with his plan,

49
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.300
it was going to inject myself with lighter came before the fight cause it,

50
00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:52.800
cause it will not,
but the problem is the area where it was was,
uh,
you,

51
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.960
you can pierce along to where I have to go in.
You,

52
00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.620
you could piss a lot of bleed to death because he turned on yet.

53
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.090
So I've got this dark and I was going to add the needle.

54
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:07.600
I had the lighter cane and I was going to fucking go in and sneak into the

55
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:11.080
toilet and facetime the doctor.
And he was like,
okay.
And anyway,

56
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:14.470
the whole thing just to do on top of it was it was bullshit.
I was like,

57
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:17.140
fuck this,
this is the stupidest plan ever.
Bollix to it.

58
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:20.260
I'll fire with the sole rib.
A bit of Adrenalin and you're not,

59
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:23.500
I've got to feel it anyway,
which I didn't under night,
you know.
But people said,

60
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:25.930
oh,
you didn't put yourself in there,
you weren't moving too much.
It's like,
yeah,

61
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:29.890
no shit.
I could've moved.
But,
eh,
but as I say,
Hey,
all credit to George,

62
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:31.990
God bless him.
He did great.
Did you,

63
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.230
there was a sparring partner that you had sparked with regularly now I,

64
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.500
it came Ed Dana.
I'm a singer.
Great Guy.

65
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.310
Just came in from England for the last couple of weeks.
So as dean,

66
00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:45.680
who took you down?
Yeah,
Dean.
Very well.
Do you know dean?
Yeah.
Yeah.

67
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.360
Fucking day in the Prager.
Yeah.
What the fuck dude?
Yeah,
no,
he's a great guy.

68
00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:52.840
Deans are so he's great.
Yeah,
he's great.
You know,
it's the way it goes.

69
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.880
You're training and uh,
yeah.
What are you gonna do?
So many fights.
It went,

70
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.250
that was half filled Los Angeles when you're supposed to fight McGregor,

71
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.800
like last,
the last sparring kicks and elbows and breaks his foot.
Oh.

72
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.630
So that's why [inaudible] came in.
Ah,
yeah.
Yeah.
It's happened to so many guys.

73
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.270
Such a fine line because,
because you feel good,
you trained your heart,

74
00:04:13.271 --> 00:04:17.650
you feel great and you think,
ah,
like you coach will say,
okay,

75
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.460
let's call it there guys.
We're good.
Call in there.
And you're like,
I dunno.

76
00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:22.360
I feel good.
Come on,

77
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:27.160
let's get one good one is because sometimes I normally train a spa Monday,

78
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.160
Wednesday,
Friday.
And if it's the Wednesday,
spire goes really well.

79
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.360
You like less end it there because you want to end on a really good spar.

80
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.280
You know what I mean?
Because you feel like a world champion,
you feel great.

81
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.210
You know,
I,
you remember how you handled all your sparring partners and,

82
00:04:43.211 --> 00:04:46.450
and whatever good shots you landed and you didn't really take any damage.

83
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.480
That's a great,
that's great momentum to go into the fight with.

84
00:04:49.481 --> 00:04:52.120
And you don't know if you have another spine surgeon is going to go like that.

85
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.400
Right.
You know?
Or you might be tired,
you might be wind down,

86
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.420
those guys might be on their game that day.
And if you get a Tufts by session,

87
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.150
well then you want to do one more because you can't go into a fight after

88
00:05:01.151 --> 00:05:03.580
getting your ass kicked and aspiring session.
You know what I mean?

89
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:07.330
That's not good Karma or energy to go in there with.
Um,

90
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.290
so it's always a weird one to fine.
It's fine balancing gags.
But,
uh,
yeah,

91
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.190
there you go.
