00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.330
Cause everything does accelerate,

2
00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.650
things constantly move forward and become more and more,
um,

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.120
more and more integrated into our life experience.

4
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.130
And I wonder what is the next stage?

5
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.020
<v 1>This if,
I mean like the,</v>

6
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.960
the secular trends and you look at technology and you look at technologies like

7
00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:22.840
blockchain for instance.
And I think,
you know,
we're,

8
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.730
we're moving to a world where anything created exists forever.
Um,

9
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.350
that there's no centralized control over who sees what,

10
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.370
um,
that,
uh,
you know,
these,
these,

11
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.910
these models become completely de centralized and all these barriers,

12
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.210
um,
that we,

13
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.680
that exist today aren't as important anymore.

14
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.760
<v 0>What do you think of something like Gab?</v>

15
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.690
Gab seems to be a response to the fact that some people are getting banned from

16
00:00:55.731 --> 00:00:59.030
other platforms and they're just allowing anybody to come on say anything they

17
00:00:59.031 --> 00:00:59.720
want.

18
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.470
The downside of that is of course the most horrible people are going to be able

19
00:01:03.471 --> 00:01:06.350
to say anything they want with no repercussions.

20
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.290
The good side is anybody can say whatever they want.

21
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.490
<v 1>Yeah.
I haven't studied them too much,</v>

22
00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:14.220
but I do know that they have taken action on accounts as well.

23
00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:18.420
They have suspended accounts and they,
if they have a terms of service as well,

24
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.110
what did they suspended accounts for?
And I dunno,
it's,

25
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.930
it's probably conduct related.
It's probably,
it might be doxing,
you know?
Um,

26
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.110
probably right.
But it's just a,
it's just a question of like,
you know,

27
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.040
the rules and if you agree to the rules,
then you know,

28
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.780
you sign up for the service and if not,

29
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.820
there will be other services.
But like,
it,
I,
you look at,

30
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.200
you look at the trends and I think,
um,
you know,

31
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.780
certainly things become a lot more public and certainly things become a lot more

32
00:01:48.781 --> 00:01:50.400
open.
Certainly the,
the,

33
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.150
the barriers and the boundaries that we have in place today become less

34
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.700
meaningful.
And I think there's a lot of positives in that.
And I,

35
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.530
I also think there's a lot of danger that we need to be mindful of.
