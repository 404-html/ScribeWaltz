1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.140
Pulls over and like two days.
Nothing right now.
No.

2
00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.050
And I could feel like,
um,
like my my butthole or you felt like,
um,

3
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.860
have broken glass inside.
Oh,
that feeling.
So I finally,

4
00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:18.630
I pushed too hard cause I,
I pushed it out like I was having a baby.

5
00:00:18.631 --> 00:00:22.740
I was like,
I was doing lamaze and then not up on the youtube screen please.

6
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.990
So I fuck it.
She's up while he's talking cause and effect.

7
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.140
And then I'm pushed and I pushed and then like,
aw man,
I could just feel,

8
00:00:34.141 --> 00:00:38.310
I saw like I wiped myself and it might the toilet paper,

9
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.240
like a fucking Tampon.
And I was in pain,
dude.

10
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.200
It says the veins around your anus tend to stretch under pressure and may bulge

11
00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:48.360
or swell,
swollen veins,

12
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.390
hemorrhoids can develop from increased pressure in the lower rectum due to

13
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.940
straining during bowel movements sitting for long periods of time on the toilet.

14
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.980
And He,
Bravo has a hilarious bit about it being on his phone,
on his phone,

15
00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:08.910
taking a shit.
It's very funny.
Remember,
did he talk about her on here?

16
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:10.020
I think you talked about it on here,

17
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.860
but it was crazy not good for your butthole to be sitting in that.

18
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.560
How would describe the feeling?
The pain?
It feels like,
um,

19
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.380
I remember talking about in a bit,

20
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.410
I said that it felt like every night though the goals sort of siloed by using me

21
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.000
like fuck you in the ass at night.

22
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.370
How many days did you go before he took a shot?

23
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.040
Or three days that then I took the shit.

24
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:35.730
That's when the pain started and I blew my butthole out I guess.

25
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.540
And then like three days later I,

26
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.080
there's shit right without paying for like two weeks while I'm afraid of fucking

27
00:01:43.081 --> 00:01:43.890
neat man.

28
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.460
I have a friend of mine had to go to a doctor and they had to literally break up

29
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:51.900
to shit in his butt hole there to go up as bottle with an instrument and break

30
00:01:51.901 --> 00:01:55.940
it up and flush them out,
get him something.
I think he had to take something,

31
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.810
some sort of diuretic and some stool loosening agent,
like some hardcore drugs.

32
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.490
And then they had to go in there with like a chisel and chop off this concrete

33
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.720
log that he had at the bottom of his bottle.
And then he,
you know,

34
00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:13.140
he hadn't shit in many strive to.
Yeah,

35
00:02:13.141 --> 00:02:15.060
it was dangerous and he couldn't get it out.

36
00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:17.610
So he was literally plugged up and it kept piling it.

37
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.730
It's not like he's going to stop eating,
it's just going to keep piling in.

38
00:02:20.731 --> 00:02:25.731
So he's got a blockade of like shit rocks at the end of his booty tunnel and

39
00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:28.890
it's,
it's a real product can be bad.
It's a real problem.

40
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.120
He had to go to a doctor.
My aunt like finally came out and then clink,
clink.

41
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.780
But it was all bad.
It was all dry with ugly man.
Painful.

42
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.730
You gotta eat your vegetables.
He'd,

43
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.130
every time I peed and after I finished paying,

44
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.310
it was hurting my butthole or threat.
Peed.
Yeah.
I mean

45
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.810
that's one thing that I freak out about people that are on this carnivore diet.

46
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.780
I hear this carnivore diet stuff and they're like,
oh no,
no problem.

47
00:02:51.781 --> 00:02:55.140
Shutting it off like no problem at all.
You don't eat any vegetables,

48
00:02:55.141 --> 00:02:56.110
you've got no problem at all.

49
00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.710
Who wouldn't really kill you to eat some Broccoli with a little Kale is a loose

50
00:03:00.711 --> 00:03:02.830
in that motherfucker life line up.

51
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.290
I just can't imagine the Broccoli's killing you.

52
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.390
I think if Broccoli's killing you,

53
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.460
there's probably something else wrong you should probably like get your blood

54
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:14.500
work done for.
I'd figured out what the vitamins are.

55
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.990
If you eat broccoli and you start getting headaches Bra,

56
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:21.610
he broccoli folks with my gains.
I eat broccoli,
I get a headache.
Sure man.

57
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:25.620
People have been eating broccoli forever.
Like how's that possible?
Like what?

58
00:03:25.621 --> 00:03:29.530
When did Broccoli ever become something that you,
you feel shitty after you ate?

59
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.190
Has anybody ever said that like,
I eat broccoli.
It just fucking get headaches.

60
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.410
If folks over my immune system dudes will claim that now these carnivore guys,

61
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.470
a lot of them are claiming like,
I,
I eat a fucking salad bro.
I'm,

62
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.300
I'm off for a while.
People attempt to then back at the other way.
In general,

63
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:49.510
Broccoli is safe to eat.
Any side effects are not serious.

64
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.500
Most common side effect is gas or bowel irritation.
Yeah.

65
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:57.280
Broccoli farts caused by Broccoli's high amounts of fiber.

66
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.380
All cruciferous.
It's a great word.
Cruciferous vegetables can make you grassy.
Oh,

67
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:06.490
gassy accrue SIF.
I like how you said Gassy,
gassy.

68
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.420
Are you a scientist or nine?
You fuck.
Okay.
When you're a scientist,

69
00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:15.040
you scientific terms,
you don't say gassy with me,
but he scares saying farts.

70
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.150
Gassy.
But the health benefits outweigh the discomfort.
Yeah,

71
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.590
so there's certain people like,
um,
that I think have a real physical issue.

72
00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:26.080
Like Jordan Peterson is one of them.
When he describes like he,

73
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.480
he literally can't have anything other than me and at this point in his life or

74
00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:35.950
it gives them headaches and it fucks with them.
I think certain people may,

75
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.480
all bullshit aside,
might have a real biological issue with vegetables,

76
00:04:40.481 --> 00:04:43.090
which sounds insane,
but it only makes sense.

77
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.460
People have a problem with everything.

78
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.920
There's certain people that have a problem with almost everything that people

79
00:04:48.921 --> 00:04:52.750
that are allergic to citrus as people that are allergic to certain now Cahtos

80
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.830
all kinds of plants.
There's people that are allergic to grass.
Why wouldn't be,

81
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.590
hey,
be allergic to some vegetables,

82
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.950
so if you are allergic to some vegetables and you just go on an all meat diet,

83
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.900
all those symptoms of those allergies go away.

84
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.140
Why wouldn't that make sense to people?
I mean they're everyone.

85
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.700
There's so many people fighting off the idea of this carnivore diet that you're

86
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.620
only eating meat and you feel fantastic.

87
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.540
You're probably dealing with a bunch of people that have undiagnosed

88
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.250
interactions like a net negative in interactions with vegetables.
They just,

89
00:05:27.251 --> 00:05:31.240
it's probably something about their system that does not go well with
vegetables,

90
00:05:31.241 --> 00:05:32.380
so they should take vitamins.

91
00:05:32.381 --> 00:05:36.580
I take vitamins and eat meat and you better find a way it gets a pri fiber.

92
00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:40.870
Kids didn't want to get all backed up.
Vegetables are good.

93
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.280
I think if you eat like a really fatty meat though,
you don't have that problem.

94
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.930
If you eat like a ton of rib eyes,

95
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.060
it just greases up that whole pipeline and you're like,
whew,

96
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:51.760
everything comes a flying out.

97
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.600
I think when you start eating that lean ground bison meat,

98
00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.020
no butter,
like you're going to have a problem.
But butterball,
yeah,

99
00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:03.500
he chew that shit down and pack it down.
Then you water on top of it.

100
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:06.920
So it's got like you got like the pack dot bison here and then he got the water

101
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:10.670
behind it.
It's concrete a it.
Oh it's way through your body.

102
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.720
Have some broccoli,
bro.
Put some cheese on it.

103
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.380
Some people really firmly believe that dairy is bad for you.

104
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.100
And that's something I've never tried.
I've never tried to do it.
Had dairy.
No,
no,

105
00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:26.480
no.
To not have dairy.
I've never tried to like way off.
Hundred percent dairy.

106
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.030
I don't eat much,
but if I do,
it's mostly cheese.

107
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.690
Hardly ever drink milk unless it's with cookies.
And whenever I do,

108
00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:35.270
I always feel weird if I a milk,
I shouldn't myself,

109
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.990
I've been my whole life tolerant or intolerant and I didn't even know that.

110
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.060
My mom never told me,
but man,

111
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.390
every time I have eating cheese I have probably get stuffed off.

112
00:06:47.391 --> 00:06:51.890
It'll come out to him.
So I fuck with almond milk and soy milk now.
Yeah.

113
00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:55.580
Do you fuck with Vegan cheese?
I publish everything big.
Only meat no more.

114
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.090
When did you stop?
But why wouldn't have fuck my ass hole blew up.
That's good.

115
00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:03.680
Move.
Cause fucked up the fiber.
And so you feel good though.

116
00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:07.860
You feel me?
I'm still fat.
People don't believe me.
They theory Vegan.

117
00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:09.560
You're fucking fat when you eat crops.

118
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:14.930
W why are you opposed to eggs on?
No,
just uh,
just give it all up,

119
00:07:14.931 --> 00:07:19.640
man.
I got so scared after right?
I started bleeding,
man.
And I said,

120
00:07:19.641 --> 00:07:24.570
you know what?
Get your diet on point.
If you feel better.
I feel good.
Yeah.

121
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.910
I mean I don't have,
I don't have the runs.
I don't got shit on myself anymore.

122
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.740
You ever try out this other t types of diets or is this the first one?
No,

123
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:37.880
I try to be in the Vegan.
I tried the Atkins Diet.
I tried,
um,

124
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.170
the Hollywood diet.
You know when you wake up in the morning and do some coke,

125
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:45.350
and in part of that one,
now this sucked.
Don't,
sorry.

126
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.420
Never try that one.
Yeah.
