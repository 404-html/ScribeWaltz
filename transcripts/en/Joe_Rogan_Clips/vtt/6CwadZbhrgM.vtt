1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.890
Shit does happen,
but you know what?

2
00:00:01.891 --> 00:00:05.340
Still maybe Brazil was like slow the fuck down with these goddamn movies,

3
00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:10.341
but they do have the biggest rain forest in the world and they do this gay shit

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.010
fucking Amazon for.
It's crazy.
I couldn't be,

5
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.910
I was a text Tim Kenny and I say I can't be when he's talking about all of those

6
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.930
Nazis.
What Duff Farese is that in Dina?

7
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.230
They flew from Germany to fucking Argentina.

8
00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:27.320
That's a true story until I text him too.
I went,
Dude,

9
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.430
you did the greatest promo ever for your discovery and history channel show

10
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.580
cause I really was.
I love Tim,
but I don't watch that much TV with that,

11
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.050
with that stuff.
He was talking about those Germans that live in Argentina.

12
00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:43.170
How many cities?
How many villages?
No,
but hundreds of thousands.

13
00:00:43.171 --> 00:00:46.770
100,000 and you go to the village.
This is an term and it's all German.

14
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.780
The architecture,
we go into the house,
it's all fucking images of it,
Jamie.

15
00:00:50.781 --> 00:00:52.820
They don't speak out there fucking lick of Spanish.

16
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.480
They were a leader hose in that drink and giant steins.

17
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.910
They're proud of their history.
Yeah.
That's what's creepy about he goes,

18
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.930
do you know what built that land?
Juice.
Fucking the,
their,

19
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.110
their cavity to fillings.
Third Wedding rings.
That's what built that.

20
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.400
I got so upset man.

21
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.520
And then he's talking about how have they would torture kids.
I just heard,

22
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.530
I stopped listening at that.

23
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.620
You sit there while he was talking about how Mengele and a lot of the SS

24
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.780
soldiers went to Argentina and continued a lot of their torture experiments and

25
00:01:24.691 --> 00:01:28.410
that they had met some of the people that had been tortured by these ss guys.

26
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.250
Horrific,
horrific young boy.
They break their bones,
bring her son back to health,

27
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.690
set him on fire.

28
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.720
Just the worst shit you can imagine just to see like what they could do.

29
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.520
I went to Argentina like 10 years ago and I swear,
I swear to God,

30
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.610
I've never been to a country with so many beautiful women really believe will

31
00:01:47.471 --> 00:01:51.540
say no more.
It's like there's,
you see like 10 at a time,
13 head,

32
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:55.540
they're like everywhere.
And you would think you would think it would be easy,
uh,

33
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.653
to pick him up.

34
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.320
But it's super hard because they have no faith in men because the men,

35
00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:03.890
they're like prostitution.
Yeah.

36
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.550
They know that there's no reason for a guy to,

37
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.510
to get committed so they don't trust guys.
So they're like,
just,
uh,

38
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.940
that was my experience.
You just like hang out.

39
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.640
They hang out with each other and they just cock block each wild wiener.
Hey,

40
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.370
travel cock block each other.
They travel in packs,
they're everywhere.

41
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.370
It's incredible.
Plus touch of God,

42
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.190
I'd love to go to Argentina.
You,
you watch this.
It's,
it's crazy man.
And,

43
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.390
and Tim said he would go there and you know,
they're,
they're like so,

44
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.600
so proud of their Nazi grandfather and stuff like that.
And Tim's like,

45
00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:41.460
what the fuck,
man,
that's crazy.
Crazy.
No,
no,
no.

46
00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:45.290
Not a lick of Spanish anywhere.
And Hitler maybe,
uh,
you know,
yeah,
that's,

47
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.060
Joe asked him,
he goes,
if you have to decide right now,

48
00:02:48.061 --> 00:02:51.780
did Hitler die in that bin?
And like history tells you,
and this is Tim Kennedy,

49
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.070
is there a total line his life?
He goes,
nope,
history's wrong on this one day.

50
00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.430
And he'd be so happy about what that history's wrong.

51
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.980
History is often wrong.
That's what I'm saying is drink.
Kennedy approves it.

52
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.940
It's working.
We go and sizzler.
Two K's never told a lie to sizzler.

53
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.740
Tip Guineas never told a lie in his life.
Are you sure?
No,
dude.
Tim Kidneys is,

54
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.640
I mean,
he's as American pies it gets,
yeah.

55
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.450
I love that guy,
man.
I cried because I thought he's going to die one time.

56
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.540
I love him.
Yeah.
He doesn't have a crazy show that he,

57
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.740
where he tries to kill himself.
They try to kill him.

58
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.190
Like what's the name of that show?
Uh,

59
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.660
what's it called?
It's like some show where someone almost died.

60
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.180
It was in Atlanta and jumps out of plane.
Yes.
Yes.
Oh,
you a bull fighting hard to,

61
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.060
hard to kill Tim Canada Ham.
That's how Steven Seagal movie,
isn't it?
Yeah,

62
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:49.420
it is terrible movie.
Although as a fan,
as a kid,
but yet,

63
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:51.340
and then he also has hunting Hitler on the history.
