WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.830
Yes,
the Avengers,
Custer by killing and scalping yellow hair,

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.140
also called yellow hand,

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.110
which he called the first scalp for Custer chains.
Cheese.

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.590
Yeah.
Big Ass show.
But here's the thing,
man that just happened.

5
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.080
All of this just happened.
We're talking about 1900 118 years ago.

6
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:25.530
It's almost a human lifespan.
This is this,

7
00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:28.650
this convergence of human beings is so recent.

8
00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:31.730
Killed these more probably like movies or in radio.
People are like,
yeah,

9
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.050
for sure.
Probably it looks like a movie production.

10
00:00:34.051 --> 00:00:36.360
Like when you see probably shot each other a bunch.

11
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.400
I'm sure there were some venereal disease involved,
so yeah,

12
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.430
they probably all died of fucking herpes.
It didn't they?
They had guns.

13
00:00:44.431 --> 00:00:47.470
They were actually shooting guns off.
They had like competitions and shoot,

14
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.150
shoot off to,
as I said,
three to four hour show.
Well,

15
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.930
that's why the West was such a popular movie for decades because it was still so

16
00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:59.880
fresh in people's minds.
I mean,
you had,
you had grandparents that you know,
right.

17
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:01.280
He knew this stuff,
right.

18
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.060
We think about like the 1950s western zone 100 years after the fact.
Right?

19
00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:08.820
That's like us watching something about something that happened during the

20
00:01:08.821 --> 00:01:12.660
depression.
Yeah.
Like once upon a time in America or something like that.
Yeah,

21
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.580
yeah,
yeah.
Right.
That is the coolest.

22
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.580
But it's what's so funny about it,
it's just show business.

23
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.120
It's like the beginning of show business.
Yeah.
Will he figured a posters?

24
00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:28.230
I mean all of it.
How much of it is really change?
You know,
you put on a big show,

25
00:01:28.231 --> 00:01:31.230
you make a cool poster,
you get these people to come and buy tickets.

26
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.130
2.5 million tickets sold.
Wow.
Wow.

27
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.790
You know what's really fucked up dude?
There was no comedy back then.
No.
Stand up.

28
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.680
Well that's what I was going to ask Mark Twain.

29
00:01:40.681 --> 00:01:44.520
When was Mark Twain running around?
Cause he was kind of like the first stand up.

30
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.540
He would go do these shows and he read,

31
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.180
he writes about it like it's a standup performance.
When was he?

32
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.290
How's your weight around?
Well they do.
He was talking about probably the first.

33
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.760
Yeah,
he was talking about things that didn't work for a laugh and oh yeah.

34
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.930
How holbrooks touring as him.
He's always touring again.

35
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.790
I didn't know that was like,
well,
when did he live?
What was,
what was the,

36
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.740
the lifespan of Twain.
So that's an interesting case.
But you know,
in Mark Twain,

37
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.150
yeah.
They use the n word all the time in,
in huckleberry.
Oh yeah.
Big Time.

38
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.230
And they're removing that now.
They were moving it,
removing it.
Who is,

39
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.780
they're editing it and removing it from the book.
So publishers,
Oh,
come on.

40
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:28.940
That's,
I mean,
yeah,

41
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.150
you want to learn about a culture and learn about at a time,
well,

42
00:02:33.151 --> 00:02:35.580
one of the characters in huckleberry Finn,

43
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:38.190
one of the main characters was nigger Jim.
This is,

44
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.180
knows his friend that they removed that the n word.

45
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.680
Really?
Yeah.
That's not accurate.
Well that's,

46
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.020
well,
that's sanitizing history and that's a mistake because you don't learn from

47
00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:56.650
that.
Jamie pulled out,
up,
pulled up the censoring of,

48
00:02:56.651 --> 00:03:01.620
um,
Tom Sawyer.
We're huckleberry Finn.

49
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.130
Mark Twain had to build a little writing room out in his ad on is,
uh,

50
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.650
one so he could smoke a cigar is out there because his wife wouldn't let him

51
00:03:09.651 --> 00:03:13.370
smoke cigars.
So he built himself a little shed to say,

52
00:03:13.371 --> 00:03:15.350
go sit out there and smoke.
Good for him.

53
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.060
I just want to see when his life span was
old twain.
Yeah.

54
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.600
He was funny.
He ever read Twain?
Yes.
He's very,
really like deer hunting.

55
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.230
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

56
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.940
<v 1>Um,
what does it say here,
Jamie?
Place the word with the word slave.
Whoa.</v>

57
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.700
Okay.
Look at this.
A new effort to sanitize.

58
00:03:32.701 --> 00:03:35.250
Huckleberry Finn Comes from Alan Gribbon,

59
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.550
a professor of English at Auburn University at Montgomery,

60
00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:43.551
Alabama who has produced a new edition of Twain's novel that replaces that word

61
00:03:43.771 --> 00:03:48.550
with slave,
um,
peers in the book more than 200 times.

62
00:03:48.551 --> 00:03:51.090
It was a common racial epitaphs of,
okay Duh.

63
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.490
You used by twain as part of his characters vernacular speech.

64
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.510
And as a reflection of the mid 19th century social attitudes along the

65
00:03:58.511 --> 00:04:00.820
Mississippi River,
there is a,
um,

66
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.140
<v 0>so an effort,
but that doesn't mean that it's been done.</v>

67
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.080
<v 1>There's a,
a ride at Disneyland.
Um,</v>

68
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.190
I want to say it's either splash mountain or,

69
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.630
<v 2>okay.</v>

70
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.950
<v 1>I think it is splash mountain splash mountain at Disneyland,</v>

71
00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:22.670
which was based on a really racist old cartoon that you can't get anymore called

72
00:04:22.671 --> 00:04:23.840
southern tails.

73
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.430
<v 0>I think it's called southern tail.
It's a Himalayan thing.</v>

74
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.250
<v 1>No,
no,
no,
that's,
that's the Matterhorn.</v>

75
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.350
<v 0>Oh,
splashback brier.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Right,
right,
right.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

76
00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.300
That was very rare.

77
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.000
<v 1>Briar bear or Briar Fox.</v>

78
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.740
<v 0>Yeah.
Brian Fox.
Fox.
Fox.
Yep.</v>

79
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.970
<v 1>Yeah.
The,
that whole thing is like,</v>

80
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
it's a southern ride and we'll just all be singing ducks and uh,

81
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.940
we,
uh,

82
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.290
we went with a guide and the guy was explaining to us that this is all based on

83
00:04:55.291 --> 00:05:00.240
a really racist old,
um,
thing that you can only get like bootleg copies of now.

84
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.640
<v 0>Ah.
Oh really?
Yeah.
This is super racist.
Old Cars.</v>

85
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.160
I had like the tar baby and,
right.
The tar baby thing.
Well,
what is it?

86
00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:12.120
It's southern tails,
right?
Is that what it's called?
Trying to find the name.
It's,

87
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.230
I'm just keeps seeing Briar Fox listed a bunch of times.

88
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.900
The song of the south telling the song of the south.

89
00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:19.750
I think that's the name of it.
Right?
I think it's called Song of the south.

90
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.650
I think that's it.
I think that's the name of it right now.
That I think about it.

91
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.390
Yeah,
but it was a panel or super racist.
Yeah,
I believe it.
There's fat,

92
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.860
a lot of bad stuff back then.
What does it is this wonder,

93
00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.580
is this,
it could be due to abuse.

94
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.193
It is.

95
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.480
<v 1>Yeah.
This is Zippity Doo Dah.
They sing this in the,
in the movie zippity Doo Dah.</v>

96
00:05:46.481 --> 00:05:46.720
Yes.

97
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.190
<v 0>This race.
Why is this racist?</v>

98
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.950
Well that's what they're asking is this racist song of the south.

99
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.710
Right now it's just the guy singing it.
Yeah.

100
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.010
<v 1>I don't think this is the part.
I think the</v>

101
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.030
<v 0>reason why you can get this online is because it's not the racist stuff cause</v>

102
00:06:02.031 --> 00:06:05.030
this is just the guy singing mister blue bird on my shoulder

103
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.790
mount.
So side of the south.
The move.

104
00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:14.230
See if you can find song of the south.
Yes.

105
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.380
There's the clip that popped up when I go.
Yeah.

106
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.150
81% liked it.
Look at rotten tomatoes.

107
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.280
7.3 on the IMD being,

108
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.930
so it's an IMD be not in 1946.
Wow.

109
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.620
Maybe it wasn't Mark Twain died in 1910 so that means that he was walking around

110
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:39.980
as an old dude doing these performances.
Uh,
you know,

111
00:06:39.981 --> 00:06:41.460
late 18 hundreds.
Yeah.

112
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.340
And so maybe that was the kind of the beginning of a standup comedy.

113
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.300
Go back to that,

114
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.870
go back to that page you were just on and that Snopes article on it where they

115
00:06:50.871 --> 00:06:55.180
do a fact check on the song of the south to see it up there.
Yeah,
it was,

116
00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:57.350
I was going to,
what does it say?
Double?

117
00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.040
I was looking to double check it before I wanted to see what it says it's true.

118
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:06.500
Was to say,
can you hold it up?
I it up.
Oh,

119
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.930
a song.
The South in Naacp Song.

120
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.960
The south unavailable on video in America because of the Naacp threats status.

121
00:07:15.441 --> 00:07:18.600
True.
Wow.
Eh.

122
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:23.510
So it was out racist.
Wonder what it was.
There was so much racist shit back then.

123
00:07:23.511 --> 00:07:28.490
It's dry or rabbit
or Fox.
Rare bear.

124
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:32.240
Why Breyer?
What does that mean?
A brier like stuck in a brighter light.

125
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.700
R Dash e we going to say it.
Yeah.
Brear rabbit.

126
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.410
Fox sprayer bear.

127
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.620
So that was the idea that they're stuck in briars the minstrel tradition of

128
00:07:42.621 --> 00:07:43.880
uncle Remus stories.

129
00:07:43.881 --> 00:07:46.880
The major objections to the song of the south had to do with the live action

130
00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:47.714
portions.

131
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:52.670
Film been criticized both for making slavery appear pleasant and pretending

132
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.300
slavery didn't exist even though the film,
that's what I kinda,

133
00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.820
you're caught in between language that potential you just said,

134
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.500
even though the film like Harris original collection of stories is set after the

135
00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:08.501
civil war and the abolition of slavery still is folklorist Patricia rates.

136
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:14.450
Yeah.
That's fascinating.
So it,
that's kind of interesting,
especially in it,

137
00:08:14.451 --> 00:08:18.990
we talk about the,
when you talk about,
uh,
the,
uh,

138
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:23.560
huckleberry Finn Part,
like they're saying,
okay,
take that out.
And then,

139
00:08:23.561 --> 00:08:24.111
then this one,

140
00:08:24.111 --> 00:08:27.500
they're saying they had an objection to making it seem like slavery didn't
exist.

141
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.300
That's why you can't take it out of huckleberry Finn because you need to know

142
00:08:32.301 --> 00:08:33.140
that this existed.

143
00:08:33.141 --> 00:08:38.090
We need to deal with it and understand it rather than sanitize it.

144
00:08:38.091 --> 00:08:42.380
Problem is defending it,
right?
Like you can't do it.
You really,

145
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.430
it's almost impossible to defend that the use of that word.

146
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:48.880
Like if you wanted to defend the use of that,
where you say,
well,

147
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:52.670
we want to put that word back in a book.
People like what are you racist.
Right?

148
00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:57.350
But you can't,
you know that this talking rationally,
this is history.
Yeah.
Right.

149
00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.160
Exactly.
Rational.
Right there.

150
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.030
No rationality when it comes to dangerous forbidden words.
Right.

151
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.800
As you saw from the Kendrick Lamar concert,
right,
right.
I mean that's,

152
00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.870
I wonder what Twain would say.

153
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.850
Do you think that ultimately like this is all going to sort itself out like
this,

154
00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:19.140
all this political correct craziness and this kind of shared that this is just a

155
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:23.700
little rough patch of chaos that we get through on our way to establishing a new

156
00:09:23.701 --> 00:09:27.810
way of communicating with people,
a new way of appreciating each other.
And then,

157
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.430
you know,
all this,

158
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:33.930
even the anti white racism and anti male sexism and all this stuff.

159
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:35.460
It's just a,
you know,

160
00:09:35.461 --> 00:09:39.060
the wave going this way and then it'll go that way and then it'll settle in the

161
00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:42.780
middle of yes.
And then we're learning from even these missteps,

162
00:09:42.781 --> 00:09:45.340
like why can't we hate all men or you know,

163
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:48.420
anything like that that we learned from these missteps and the outrage that goes

164
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:51.990
to these missteps.
And we say,
Oh,
I understand why this woman feels this way.

165
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:57.110
She's probably abused by men and dealt with asshole men and asshole bosses and

166
00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.210
see these people like Harvey Weinstein in the mainstream media that have a of

167
00:10:02.211 --> 00:10:07.211
abused and violated and victimized women and that it is going to balance itself

168
00:10:07.831 --> 00:10:11.550
out.
And the only way it goes is you have to have outrage and then correction and

169
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:15.900
yeah,
I mean that's the way history seems to go.
It seems like,
you know,
there's,

170
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.880
you would think in certain ways like,
oh,

171
00:10:17.881 --> 00:10:21.030
we don't have to work that hard to abolish these evils,

172
00:10:21.031 --> 00:10:24.420
but then evil pops up again and it feels like,
okay,
no,
it's still here.

173
00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.540
We still have to deal with it.
And you just hope at the end,

174
00:10:27.541 --> 00:10:29.010
we all end up like Bruno Mars.

175
00:10:29.011 --> 00:10:32.640
We all look like Bruno Mars and everybody's happy because no one knows who,

176
00:10:32.641 --> 00:10:34.200
what anybody is.
Yeah.

177
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:37.230
Just having a good time and we're all a little darker and not totally white,

178
00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.650
not totally black and everybody's,
but wait a minute.
What about white people?

179
00:10:40.651 --> 00:10:44.820
I like looking at white people.
I like people I like.
I like the whole,

180
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.460
I liked the fact that we have variety in the way people look.

181
00:10:47.461 --> 00:10:51.890
Like some people look like seal and [inaudible] and some people look like,

182
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:56.520
um,
it was like a super white lady.
Um,

183
00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:01.930
like a
cool kid.
Been Nicole Kidman.
A pitch is white.

184
00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:07.200
Yeah.
White.
So they are almost red.
Yeah.

185
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:10.050
It is good to have a nice mix.
Fuck man.

186
00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.640
It's fascinating.
We're still these very.
