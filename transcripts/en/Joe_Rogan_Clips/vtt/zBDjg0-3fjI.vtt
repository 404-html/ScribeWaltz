00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.020
What's astonishing to me is how anytime something does come out on Trump,

2
00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:08.430
it just seems to slide right off.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well that is true.

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.383
That is true,
isn't it?

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.570
Because I think what's happening is they're just throwing everything out there

5
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:15.250
every day.
Right?
Yeah.
Much like,
you know,

6
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.560
our willingness to give up privacy because we keep hearing about another hack or

7
00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:22.080
another lake or we know that Amazon's doing this or that.

8
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.430
I think it's that constant drum beat and that mudslinging and I think the dems

9
00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:27.780
haven't done themselves any favors.

10
00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:30.720
So the resistance movement or what do we want to call it?
Um,

11
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.340
because I think people are just immune to it and it's hardened the Trump's base

12
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.740
to think,
you know,
he's under attack every minute,
so I gotta support them harder.

13
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.170
Um,
yeah.
But,
uh,
you know,
who do you think's going to end up in,

14
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.020
in the race?
I mean,
who's got the best chance?
A good question.
I mean,

15
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.170
on the left hand side,
I mean,
I,
the,

16
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.190
my real fear is that Hillary was going to run again.

17
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.260
So I almost did one of those TV spit takes.
It's possible.

18
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.090
[inaudible] when lady is crazy,
you know,

19
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.200
one of the things that she said and one of the more recent interviews,
she said,

20
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.140
I'd like to be president.
I'd like to be president.
Just what do you,

21
00:01:09.141 --> 00:01:12.390
what do you want to put it on your resume?
What the fuck does that mean?

22
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.170
I think I could do a great job and turning this country around.

23
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.220
I have the leadership ability to really affect a change.
No,
no,
no.

24
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.110
I'd like to be president.
I got some time I could do that.
I'm scared of them.

25
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.570
Yeah.
Well,
you know what,
and you're right.
She May,
but I,
I,

26
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.030
I do think it's going to be so much pressure on her from the party to just say,

27
00:01:33.031 --> 00:01:35.430
no,
you can't.
I think she's going to look at that and go,
I,

28
00:01:35.431 --> 00:01:38.790
there's no chance I can rally the apparatus around me like I did the last time.

29
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.710
And because of that,
um,
because even she can't run without the machine.
Right?

30
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.960
I mean,
that's,
they've got to figure that out.

31
00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:50.961
So I just wonder if she has so many people that owe her favors and she's so

32
00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:55.200
deeply entrenched in the world that she could somehow,

33
00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:59.480
or another muster up enough support to give it one more shot.
Yeah.

34
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I mean it's,
it's possible.
I mean,
yeah,

35
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.610
but then you're talking about her all the way to two.
What to,
to,
uh,

36
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.310
Kamala Harris,
Cory booker,

37
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.630
Tulsi Gabbert Tulsi Gabbard Telsey Guillard Castro was a veteran.

38
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.770
Young makes a lot of sense.
Very smart,
articulate.

39
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.090
I think she has a real legitimate chance of getting people excited about a real

40
00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:25.140
future.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I would not,
uh,
you know,

41
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.900
I think it's time was certainly close.
We're getting to that point where we'll,

42
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.760
uh,
you know,
we end up with a female president and hey,
good for us.
Right.

43
00:02:32.761 --> 00:02:37.200
I got no problems.
You know,
there's,
I think it would actually,
you know,

44
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.510
I think it would turn the ship in a nice direction,
right.

45
00:02:39.511 --> 00:02:42.030
As long as the policies are good,
I don't care who it is.

46
00:02:42.031 --> 00:02:45.720
As long as we're not veering off into,
uh,
you know,

47
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.450
sort of socialist policy,
you know,
land and thinking,

48
00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:51.690
somehow we're going to all going to end up with a universal basic income.
