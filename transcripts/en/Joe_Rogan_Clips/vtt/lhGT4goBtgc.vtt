1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.470
Footage.
Oh really?
Yeah.
The,
the show time.
Dot.

2
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.370
Had like the footage of the,
that show.
Oh,

3
00:00:07.371 --> 00:00:10.190
the show where he was prepping like where he's getting ready to,
well,

4
00:00:10.191 --> 00:00:13.510
not all like the show were just taking go like,
you know what Steve,

5
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.930
you want to stay with them while they filmed the,
you know,

6
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.550
that strip show where he had to come back the next night and kind of Redo it.

7
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.010
He just had like,
he was just,
he,
he,
you know,

8
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.140
operating from such a place of just like,
it was so odd.

9
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.340
It had to be honest to him I think.

10
00:00:31.341 --> 00:00:35.360
And it had just hadn't gone up in a while and was on stage and it was just like

11
00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:40.250
in the room and just sat in.
It just,
he just sat,
there was,

12
00:00:40.251 --> 00:00:44.270
footage is crazy.
Send me that.
Wow.
Yeah.
It's really,
who's got the footage?
Well,

13
00:00:44.271 --> 00:00:46.820
it's in the dock.
You can see it in a documentary like a little bit,

14
00:00:46.821 --> 00:00:48.050
but I think it's extended for it.

15
00:00:48.051 --> 00:00:51.590
I haven't seen the extended footage if that exists,
but

16
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.620
<v 1>there's some great old cassettes that I bought from a,</v>

17
00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.420
like a gas station.

18
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.230
There were a red foxes comedy club,

19
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.410
Red Fox had a comedy club and prior would go up and just fuck around man,

20
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.410
just fuck around.
And there was many of them.

21
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.530
I mean there was like seven or eight recordings,
Mavericks flat,

22
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.660
I think it was right.

23
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.340
That was the name of the company off of like Crenshaw or something over there

24
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.320
like,
Oh,
where the club was,
I don't know.
I got them when I was living in Boston,

25
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.710
I was living in Boston and I found them like at a gas station there were for

26
00:01:29.711 --> 00:01:34.240
sale.
Oh yeah.
And it was crazy because it was like,
it was small crowd,

27
00:01:34.241 --> 00:01:38.800
you could tell it was a small crowd and prior was just fucking around man.

28
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.770
He was just,
he was ad libbing.

29
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.490
You could tell that like it wasn't structured and some of it was really funny

30
00:01:45.491 --> 00:01:50.410
and some of it like kind of fell flat and you can hear the clink of glasses and

31
00:01:50.411 --> 00:01:54.900
shit in the background.
And it was just so real rich,
you know,

32
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.590
Richard Pryor back then,

33
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.070
he was doing something that it's like he had figured out a thing that he could

34
00:02:02.651 --> 00:02:04.960
do that other people hadn't figured out.
And that thing was like,

35
00:02:04.961 --> 00:02:07.300
just be totally honest.

36
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.340
And also just explore ideas onstage in front of people,

37
00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:14.400
like not even have it mapped out yet.
Just try,

38
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.840
just fuck around and find what's funny.

39
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.390
And he'd be smoking cigarettes and just talking and he figured out a way to turn

40
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.720
and then you would see it boiled in to like Richard Pryor live or live in the

41
00:02:25.721 --> 00:02:28.870
sunset strip or any of his specials.
You'd see it boiled down to this.

42
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.480
<v 0>Yeah,
yeah.
Doing it for,
tell it,
you know,</v>

43
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.830
he performed for television really well.
Um,
and,

44
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.710
and that's like kind of,
uh,
an element that,
uh,

45
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.040
I think people kind of forget that.
Like how well of a,

46
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.310
it connected with you watching it at home.
Like,
you know,

47
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.290
even me,
20,

48
00:02:51.291 --> 00:02:55.790
30 years later after it's filmed and just watching it with my dad,

49
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.850
it,
he plays really well here.
You know what I mean?

50
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:05.250
Like to you,
it's like you can feel how personal and how honest it is and like,

51
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.670
so when it was like boiled down,
it was just,
he was also captured really well.

52
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.900
Did you ever see him live?
No.
Prior?
Yeah.
Wait,
how old do you think I am?

53
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.900
<v 1>No,
he was alive.
Uh,
doing stand up 10 years ago?
Yeah.</v>

54
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.530
Maybe a little bit more,
maybe 15 years ago.
He died.
He died.

55
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.810
Uh,
maybe it was more than 15 years ago now that I'm thinking about it.

56
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.020
Is you ever seen him live?
Yeah,
I had,
um,

57
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.870
I had a follow him like five weeks in a row,
man.
Really Weird.

58
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.510
Like I'll run in 2005 he died.
Okay.
So it was more than I thought

59
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.620
he did a run before he died.
It was probably right before then.

60
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.390
Um,
actually I want to say it was like the late nineties,

61
00:03:48.391 --> 00:03:50.150
early 2000,
somewhere around then.

62
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.080
He was real sick and they would have to carry him to the stage and it would take

63
00:03:55.081 --> 00:03:58.500
like five minutes for him to get to the stage so that he introduced him and the

64
00:03:58.501 --> 00:04:01.980
comic would get out of the way.
And then,
um,
uh,

65
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.040
chewy and Maryland Martinez husband would help him walk to the stage.

66
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.440
They would hold on to him,
take him to stage.
It may take forever.

67
00:04:10.441 --> 00:04:13.680
It was a slow process and they'd get them and they sit them down and they'd

68
00:04:13.681 --> 00:04:15.030
crank up the mic like this.

69
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.360
<v 2>Sure.</v>

70
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.600
<v 1>Because his voice was so soft bowling.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And he would do stand up.</v>

71
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.560
I do like 15,
20 minutes and then I would go on after every,

72
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.180
almost every time it would be me and,
uh,

73
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.200
just eat shit shit.

74
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.400
First of all,
nobody knew who I was.
And second of all,

75
00:04:38.401 --> 00:04:42.920
they just saw Richard Pryor and they're sad because he's fading away.

76
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.500
<v 0>Yeah.
Right in front of everybody.
Yeah.
It's an interesting feeling.</v>

77
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.800
Like never before.
It was like a British type in emission,

78
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.840
been needed more British type information,
you know,
like where it's just like,

79
00:04:54.841 --> 00:04:57.480
all right,
Richard Pryor was gone and uh,
you know,

80
00:04:57.481 --> 00:04:59.880
15 minutes people go smoke cigarettes,
come back.

81
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.760
What year did you start doing stand up?
A 2008 yeah.
So you missed it.
Yeah.

82
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.120
Did you go to the clubs at all before then to look around?
Uh,
no.
Well,

83
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:10.290
<v 2>yeah.</v>

84
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.840
<v 0>Two nights before.
My first time,</v>

85
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.320
two nights before your first two nights before our first time I went to,
uh,

86
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.760
the comedy store.
Wow.
Yeah.
Did you my first day in la?

87
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:21.580
My first day in la,

88
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.190
I saw the whole show nine to 2:00 AM.

89
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.460
Wow.
You sat through the whole show,
the whole show did the open mic that Sunday.
