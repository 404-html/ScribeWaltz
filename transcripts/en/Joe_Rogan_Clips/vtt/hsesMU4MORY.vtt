1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.080
The joe rogan experience?
No,
he's not being mean.
I wasn't doing racial jokes,

2
00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:07.860
like being heavy on racial jokes just cause I was like,
I don't fucking know.

3
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.120
I don't,
I don't care.

4
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.150
Like I don't give a shit enough about equality to put my job on the line to try

5
00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:17.760
to make everyone,
even like I'll,
I'll get into nights if it's an all black room.

6
00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:22.200
I just do black jokes but not mean,
but just what I do.
Black jokes.
But um,

7
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.730
and then you do that.
Once you do that,

8
00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:26.640
you have a fuck him power of attorney to do anything.

9
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.500
Cause even the clean people go my kid's finger,

10
00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:33.490
they're asked to write right now and then,
and then and then,
oh,
I'm in pride.

11
00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:35.700
Talk to the audience a little.
When you were saying that you,
um,

12
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.590
you used to do a real racist jokes or racial jokes,
racial jokes,

13
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.290
you know,
w you and you stopped doing them because they offended too many people.

14
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.380
No,
I never got,
no one ever got offended,

15
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:50.910
but I just noticed that I was up for one.
I was obsessing on it.
I,
I would write,

16
00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:55.440
I could write all day long.
I could write jokes about black people.
I mean,

17
00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:59.070
if you've sent me,
I swear to God,
if you put me in a room with a black audience,

18
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.020
all I'll do is talk about black people all I'll do.
And like now the dirt,

19
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.340
the one only the furthest I go is I have a joke about,
um,
just uh,

20
00:01:08.341 --> 00:01:11.190
I go think his racist that they don't make black baby powder.

21
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.310
Like I just think that from a company named Johnson and Johnson,

22
00:01:14.311 --> 00:01:17.610
they would have thought of that by now.
And then they go,
you know that,
uh,

23
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.240
that's home and make $1 million.
I'm gonna make back baby powder.
And then,
uh,

24
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.630
and then,
and I'll call it magic Johnson and Johnson's.

25
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.960
So then one night there's one,
this is great.
One night this black dude's,
it's,

26
00:01:27.961 --> 00:01:32.160
I'm in an audience in Miami goes,
hey mother Fucker,
when you get done,

27
00:01:32.161 --> 00:01:35.430
you put a joke about black baby powder.
I'll tell you I don't make shit.

28
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.250
And so I was like,
I'm think I'm done with the joke now.
Like with,

29
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.100
why don't they make it?
And he goes,

30
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.180
we don't have a problem with moisture the way you guys do.
He goes,

31
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.930
every time I'll hug a white guy,
it's like hugging a dolphin.
He goes,

32
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.300
black people have a problem retaining moisture.

33
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.550
So they have a problems getting ashy,
so they have to always stay moist.

34
00:01:56.551 --> 00:02:00.540
Whereas white people are constantly fucking moist.
Whoa.
And so he's like,

35
00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:04.710
they just never needed black baby powder like people don't use.
And I was like,

36
00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:08.880
but it was awesome.
It was like a great moment.
I love,
dude,
if I could,

37
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.050
if I had a video tape of every experience that I would like to in one of

38
00:02:12.051 --> 00:02:16.280
audience,
I would be the most famous comic in the world.
The,

39
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.980
I've hadn't black dudes get on stage in Miami,
right?
Real Shit.

40
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.260
Fucking three gangsters in the front row.
True Story.
All my children fucking,

41
00:02:25.261 --> 00:02:26.580
they're ruining the show for everyone.

42
00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:28.310
And I go up and I just talked to them one day.

43
00:02:28.311 --> 00:02:31.430
He gets up on stage halfway through my set and he's like,
there's,

44
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.070
there's a real motherfucker.
He's keeping a real,
real talk right now.
Real talk,

45
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.400
you know,

46
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.250
real motherfuckers get into three Oh five and he drops his pants and shows his

47
00:02:38.251 --> 00:02:42.870
Dick Place goes bananas,
right?
They're like,
whoa.
And it's a the biggest blackest.

48
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.910
It's almost purple.
It's so black like,
but as Jack,
huge,
it's huge.
And I'm like,

49
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.070
that is real.
That is fucking real.

50
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.850
And then I'm out bugging month nine inches and it's a,
it's a,

51
00:02:53.851 --> 00:02:57.060
it's a show or it's like a thick,
thick,

52
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.440
thick and uncircumcised.
Just looking at it like,
Holy Shit.
So then I go,
I go,

53
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:05.920
man,
that's fucking,
his name was ray.
I don't know why I remember that.

54
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:07.150
But I'm like,
Ray,
I go,

55
00:03:07.151 --> 00:03:10.870
I think you might want to get off stage because I can guarantee you you're,

56
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:13.690
they're calling the cops right now and I don't want you to go to jail for just

57
00:03:13.691 --> 00:03:16.660
showing your Dick.
He's like,
I appreciate that.
Good looking out.

58
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:20.500
And then he puts his pants on and leave.
So then I go,
man,
how do you follow that?

59
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.290
Another gang,
gangbangers stands up,
gets on stage.
I go,
please tell me.

60
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:27.480
We're seeing another cock right now.
Pulls his pants down,
bugging justice,

61
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.860
big but lighter,
lighter,
like a lighter brown.
And I'm like,
Holy Shit.
I'm like,

62
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.860
and I was like,
you might want to go catch up with breaks.

63
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.460
I guarantee you they're calling the cops now.
So they're sitting with,

64
00:03:36.461 --> 00:03:40.210
I swear to you,
all my children,
they're sitting with inherit a hairless albino.

65
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.680
Okay.
And I said,

66
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.070
and now and now that the crowd is like fucking in a fevered pitch.
I go,

67
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.240
that's funny.
Out of all the Dicks,
I wanted to see what was yours.
He stands up,

68
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.130
gets on stage,
takes his dick out and it looks like a light house.
No grass,

69
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.750
right white and the PO,
they're flipping over fucking tables now.

70
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.020
Fucking going nuts.
And I was like,
Ladies and gentlemen,
that's my show.

71
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.400
Oh,
I literally followed that.
You can't follow that.
Can't follow it.
I literally,

72
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.490
and I've white glow in the dark Casper that goes,
Dick Hall was,

73
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.210
it was beautiful and it was big.
It was big.
I swear to you.
It was big.

74
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:22.090
And I was like,
oh,
I was like fucking.
And then,

75
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.920
and then they all waited for me out at the bar and they were like,
dude,

76
00:04:24.921 --> 00:04:28.600
we taking you out.
And I was like,
this doesn't end this way.

77
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.520
I love when he,
when he bombs there is so rare.

78
00:04:33.521 --> 00:04:34.900
He's really fucking funny man.

79
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.050
It's like when it's like when you shoot a bear with a bow and Arrow,

80
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.610
but they don't know they've been injured yet,

81
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.070
but they know there has to be shot with a bow and arrow.

82
00:04:42.071 --> 00:04:45.820
I watched a lot of hunting.
I watched a lot of hunting videos like I used to.

83
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.780
I used to,
if I,
if I ever got too fucked up within,
I'd watch hunting in Florida,

84
00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:53.320
it's very easy to get really bear bear hunting from,
in my opinion,

85
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.480
you've done it.
I've never done it.
But all the videos are,

86
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.440
they like put a box out full of food and then they'd sit in a tent and then the

87
00:04:59.441 --> 00:05:02.050
bear would come out and they shoot it with a bow and Arrow and the bear would

88
00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:05.160
get hit,
but it would almost feel,
it would seem like the bear be like,
ow,

89
00:05:05.161 --> 00:05:05.994
what the fuck was that?

90
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.620
And then you'd see the look in the bear's face where they'd be like,

91
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.320
I don't feel good.
I'm going to go rest for a little bit.

92
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.730
That's how so girl looks,
when he bombs,
it's like,
it's like,
he's like,
he like,

93
00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:19.070
he looks at you like,
did I get,
I get hit?
And you're like,
and you're,

94
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.280
and you know,
he's been hit by an arrow.
My favorite one was in,
uh,
in,
in,
uh,

95
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.230
in Pearl Harbor.
Me,
Tahara,
Hawaii,
me,
Thompson,

96
00:05:27.231 --> 00:05:31.540
[inaudible] and Russell Peters.
And,
uh,
I go up and I do okay,

97
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.250
but maybe I was dirtier than I should have been.

98
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.290
That's totally fine because the only rules were don't make fun of the Hawaiians.

99
00:05:38.291 --> 00:05:41.740
That was it.
Don't make fun of the Hawaiians and don't bring up Pearl Harbor.

100
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.780
What?
Tom's opening joke.
He's like,
man,
it's a lot of fat people.

101
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.980
He's like,
I heard island life was slow,

102
00:05:49.981 --> 00:05:51.820
but I didn't know they were talking about their metabolism.

103
00:05:51.821 --> 00:05:54.640
So then it says I got lost walking around.

104
00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:57.980
Luckily a Japanese guy pointed out the directions man,
those Japanese,
no,

105
00:05:57.981 --> 00:05:59.510
this place like the back of their hand.

106
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.810
I mean he bumps so hard that when he got off he was like that early sweats like

107
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:09.470
where you could and he's like,
he's like,
who are pretty good and you're like,

108
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.270
you might want to go back to your nest and raw.

109
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:12.860
You know Tom's going to lose his shit.

110
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.300
That video of where I'm shaving Tom that that week?
Yeah,

111
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.650
for after the show.
Before how many shows did you guys do?
One?
Just one.

112
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.910
Just one.
I went up,
I was a little dirty.
I think Tom went up,
had a rough set.

113
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.380
He kind of want him back.

114
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.820
You know Tom is not right for corporate gig in that opinion in there's a

115
00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:33.350
corporate gig for the,

116
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:38.210
it was like maybe I want to say 3000 people on at Pearl Harbor sitting in lawn

117
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:41.300
chairs with their families.
What was the Gig like?
What,
who is it for?

118
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.880
For the Pearl.
For the USO.
Ah,
that's on,
that's a military guy.
Yes.

119
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.770
Corporate Kid.
That same same energy.

120
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.520
So I and so then Tom sits next to me.
This is my favorite part.

121
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.660
Thompson texted me and Russell Peters comes on stage and you can hear there's a

122
00:06:56.661 --> 00:06:57.740
murmuring now mind you,

123
00:06:57.741 --> 00:07:02.741
we're at war with Iraq and Russell Peters is a little brown for their taste and

124
00:07:02.841 --> 00:07:05.810
Tom goes,
I never realized he looks like the enemy.

125
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.260
And Russell Peters is by the way,

126
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.180
didn't acknowledge it did had a great set but you could hear that kind of like

127
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.230
they brought up one of the like and Tom and I were in the back like this is bad.

128
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.280
We the next day you thought it was bad because he was brown.

129
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:26.960
It was only because we had gone to rifle training the day before and Russell had

130
00:07:26.961 --> 00:07:31.520
randomly chose not to go randomly.
And the first words that rifle training was,

131
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.520
there's one rule here.
If it's Brown,
it moves,
you kill it.

132
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.230
And Rob and Tom was like,
thanks guys,
you didn't bring rough.
Let the fuck.

133
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:42.140
Imagine if you're Mexican and you're in the fucking army and they tell you that

134
00:07:42.141 --> 00:07:46.700
shit.
If it's brown and it moves,
we kill it.
Whoa.
That guy said that.

135
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.670
And we brought our wives to it.
We we've had arrives to rifle,

136
00:07:49.671 --> 00:07:53.570
we shot every gun they had.
We brought our wives and the girls were like,

137
00:07:53.571 --> 00:07:55.970
right before we went,
stepped in and they go,
can we go to the bathroom?
Or like,

138
00:07:55.971 --> 00:07:59.690
yeah,
go to the bathroom.
So we walk in and the guy's like,
uh,

139
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.410
I thought they were going to be six.
He's like a real military guy.

140
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:05.510
And we're like,
yeah,
the girls went to the bathroom.
It was okay.

141
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.270
And then Tom goes,
hey,
do me a favor.
When they get in,

142
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.750
act a little like aggressive to them and misogynistic.

143
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.040
And let's just see the looks on their faces.
So the girls walk in and he was on,

144
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:18.460
well,
typical lady's got lost.
Don't know what time it is.

145
00:08:18.461 --> 00:08:19.760
If their man's not next to him.

146
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.900
And Christina and my wife started bubbling like what the,
and he's like,

147
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.560
ladies do follow the men don't know what to do there,
you gentlemen.

148
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:31.970
And he got into character so good that Tom stepped in.
He's like,
it's a joke.

149
00:08:31.971 --> 00:08:34.850
Everybody hits a joke.
He's doing it because we asked him to.

150
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.640
This guy was good.
Wow.
That's funny.
Yeah.

151
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:41.300
That's hilarious.

152
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.930
That's funny that you can get a trained killer just to crack jokes.
Oh,

153
00:08:44.931 --> 00:08:48.110
the guy was,
it was,
it was a really fun trip.
If it's Brown,
kill it.

154
00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.030
If it's Brown and it moves you kill it.

155
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:55.060
The gumption or the gregariousness to break in in the when you're doing sets or

156
00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:57.270
was it,
I was,
I don't even know what the fuck I was doing.

157
00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:00.870
I was working out at Barnes and noble.
So you were working at Barnes and noble?

158
00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:05.330
No,
working out.
Working out.
Uh,
this is bad.
You do sets of bonds?
No.

159
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:08.490
What was working at Barnes and noble and then working out during the day and the

160
00:09:08.491 --> 00:09:12.840
basement.
Like I was fucking,
I got fired from partisan Nova.
This is the worst.

161
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.800
I was working at Barnes and noble and astro place.
No fucking AC.

162
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:20.120
And so everyday I would you ever have a job where you lift boxes and as you do

163
00:09:20.121 --> 00:09:22.620
you're like that's not a bad but a good buy workout and you're like,

164
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.450
oh all right I'll do a little bit of this.

165
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.480
And if I do this all day long and I'm fucking jacked buys by the end of the

166
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.170
summer.
So I'd go down to the basement and you could take the freight elevator,

167
00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:33.330
I'm going to sound like a psycho into five minutes.

168
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.510
You can take the freight elevator to the basement and no one could get down

169
00:09:36.511 --> 00:09:39.150
there cause you had the elevator.
And so once I got to the basement,

170
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.740
I take off my clothes and start working out and just like do pushups,
sit ups,

171
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:48.630
fucking curls with boxes,
whole books out into fucking these fucking jobs,

172
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.840
front rows.
And I work out.
And then it was,
there was no AC.

173
00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:54.270
So then I'd wait till I cooled down,
put all my clothes back on,

174
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.450
getting the freight elevator walk up and I just killed like 30 minutes.

175
00:09:57.451 --> 00:10:00.420
When you have a job like that to kill 30 minutes is a,

176
00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:04.590
it's like fucking calm that much closer to being over done.
So I'm like,

177
00:10:04.591 --> 00:10:08.880
this is an eating rip fuel to remember ritual pop in fucking three refuels every

178
00:10:08.881 --> 00:10:13.230
three hours,
right?
Oh my God.
Like a tweaker running around Shelvin travel books.

179
00:10:13.231 --> 00:10:15.790
Go down to the basement,
pounding like I'm in fucking Oz

180
00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:21.520
and then come up sweating like a motherfucker with a name tag on.
Just,
uh,

181
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.110
and so like two weeks into it,
my boss Duane pulls me aside and he was like,

182
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.840
he was like,
Hey man,
you've been spending a lot of time in the basement.

183
00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:29.880
And I was like,
Oh yeah,
cause I got to get travel books.

184
00:10:29.881 --> 00:10:31.770
And that's where we keep them all down there.
And he's like,
yeah,

185
00:10:31.771 --> 00:10:36.750
do you know we have video cameras?
I was

186
00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:41.660
like,
I didn't know that.
He's like,
you're fucking fired.
And I was like,
wow.

187
00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.610
I did Duane,
I can explain to you is no I can't,

188
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.450
I can't have someone getting into their underwear basement working out,

189
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:52.200
doing they should be working and then coming back up and then interacting with

190
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:56.040
people and I was trying to be a comic so I was trying to think alternatively and

191
00:10:56.041 --> 00:10:58.460
I'm on speed,
which is Kim.

192
00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:03.740
So theoretically like I would do funny shit but it was crazy if you didn't know

193
00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:05.550
me exactly.

194
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.570
Some guy told you the day we were doing a promo shoot for HDTV and I did a joke

195
00:11:09.571 --> 00:11:11.640
at the end of the day,
like it was that funny.
He goes,
Bert,

196
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.480
everything you do is only funny if you've spent fucking 24 hours with you.

197
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:16.771
And so yeah.

198
00:11:16.771 --> 00:11:20.400
So I got fired and then came home would be great to have that tape if anyone at

199
00:11:20.401 --> 00:11:23.670
Barnes and noble.
And so his name is Dwayne.

200
00:11:23.671 --> 00:11:27.270
I remember he asked me if I wanted to be a manager like a week before that and I

201
00:11:27.271 --> 00:11:30.120
was like,
no.
And it was like,
what?
And I was like,
he was like,

202
00:11:30.121 --> 00:11:32.370
you don't want to be manager.
And I was like,
no.
He's like,
why?

203
00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.940
Why do you w w what do you want to do?
Then I was like,
I want to be a comedian.

204
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.210
And I was like,
oh,
this isn't what I do.
And he looked at me dead in the face.

205
00:11:39.211 --> 00:11:42.390
He goes,
this is what you do.
This is who you are.
You work at Barnes and noble.

206
00:11:42.391 --> 00:11:46.800
Don't think you're better than us.
You're not.
Fuck,
I'm out of here soon.

207
00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.060
I didn't know I was going to get fired,

208
00:11:48.061 --> 00:11:53.061
but don't think you're better than us at Burke Chrysler was telling when I

209
00:11:53.141 --> 00:11:56.740
smell.
Might be one of the great stories.
No Dad,
no.

210
00:11:56.741 --> 00:11:59.980
He used to shit his pants all the time.
All the time.

211
00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:04.000
How long would you said the story began with you saying that he shit his pants

212
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.900
in a banana republic in Beverly Hills and uh,

213
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.120
it was,
it was like real,

214
00:12:10.121 --> 00:12:14.110
it was like the real coming of age part of my life when my dad looked at me and

215
00:12:14.111 --> 00:12:17.140
he was like,
buddy,
I'm about to shit my pants.
What do I do?
We use the word,

216
00:12:17.141 --> 00:12:18.670
it's not the,
here's where public have a bathroom,

217
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.670
here's the fucking worst part of it,
right?
So I look at him and I go to shit,

218
00:12:21.671 --> 00:12:24.070
your pants dad,
I think you shit your pants and I go,

219
00:12:24.071 --> 00:12:27.460
Shit your pants a little bit and then walk as far as you can and get to your

220
00:12:27.461 --> 00:12:28.480
hotel.
And he just left.

221
00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:31.670
My daughter's with me like fucking drop them and was like,
I'm fucking know yet.

222
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:35.020
And so we started walking down Rodeo or whatever,
you know,
Burton,

223
00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:38.950
one of those roads to get to his hotel,
right?
So my mom comes up and she's like,

224
00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:41.980
she's like,
where's your dad?
And I said,
oh,
he left me this sweater,

225
00:12:41.981 --> 00:12:44.010
I got to buy it for,
I'm bought them,
ended up buying them the sweater and he,

226
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.450
I go,
he had to shit his pants.
She goes,

227
00:12:46.451 --> 00:12:48.820
what do you mean he had he shit his pants.
I go,
we ended,
she had to shit.

228
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:51.850
So he shit his pants and then he just,
he's walking on the street.
I go,

229
00:12:51.851 --> 00:12:55.030
I'm sure we can catch him.
He's walking slow.
And then my wife comes up,
she goes,

230
00:12:55.031 --> 00:12:56.380
where's your dad?
And I go,
he shit his pants.
She goes,

231
00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.300
why didn't you just use the bathroom?
I said,
where's the bathroom?

232
00:12:58.301 --> 00:13:01.680
She goes downstairs and I went,
Ooh,
I probably should have told him that and so

233
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:05.410
I don't know.
I was in panic mode.

234
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:09.040
It was black Friday and I'm waiting in line too when I got a leather jacket on

235
00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:13.060
sale,
but it's even worse I think if you shit your pants in line for the bathroom

236
00:13:13.061 --> 00:13:15.310
because then everybody's going to know if there's a big line of people that you

237
00:13:15.311 --> 00:13:19.600
just is dumping your pants,
then you're like close proximity.

238
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:22.390
No way to play off shitting your pain when you shit your pants.

239
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.090
I say this shitting your pants is a lot like getting a Dui.

240
00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.900
You roll the dice so much and get away with it that when you do get caught with

241
00:13:28.901 --> 00:13:29.740
your hand and cookie jar,

242
00:13:29.741 --> 00:13:32.680
you're like mother fucker and then she never thought that was going to happen.

243
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:33.910
Are you kidding me?

244
00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:39.310
Why today?
Oh,
that's so true.

245
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:43.990
When his thirties he was running marathons and he used to shoot his pants all

246
00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:46.660
the time.
Not even like,
I'm not even saying like,
I'm not even saying like,

247
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:51.250
oh once a month,
I'm talking once a week he would,

248
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:52.960
this is before cell phones too.

249
00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.080
He was in his thirties he was in his thirties I was a,
I was a kid.

250
00:13:56.081 --> 00:13:59.560
We were living in,
in like North Tampa,
not in like the nicer north Tampa,

251
00:13:59.561 --> 00:14:02.620
but in the Shittier redneck verse,
Black North Tampa.

252
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.740
And a first time I ever heard her,
the n word was in this neighborhood,

253
00:14:05.741 --> 00:14:08.950
but my dad used to run marathons so we'd run like five miles,

254
00:14:08.951 --> 00:14:12.340
10 miles and you can go out and on these 10 mile runs,
he shit his pants.

255
00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.190
So he go into these orange groves,
shit himself,
right.

256
00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:19.090
Clean himself the best he could and then run home.
But there were some nights,

257
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.380
I remember these distinctly,

258
00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.600
it was before cell phones were it get dark and my mom's like,

259
00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:23.920
we got to go look for your dad.

260
00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:27.130
And we'd be driving his route where he'd run all of a sudden like a naked

261
00:14:27.131 --> 00:14:30.580
happening.
My Dad would come out of the fucking orange groves like,
I'm here,

262
00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:34.720
give me in the car right now.
If he knew who he come get him.
Oh,
he just would.

263
00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:35.613
Yeah,
it would be.

264
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.710
I remember thundering lightning and he's just sitting in an orange grove naked.

265
00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:42.490
Like how did he shit his pants and,
and we'd be like over here and he'd be like,

266
00:14:42.491 --> 00:14:44.710
all right,
and you just hop in the front seat,
go home,
let's go.

267
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.440
Like real quick shit.
His pants.

268
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:52.310
He hates my stories.
I hope someone,
if anyone is listening to this,
knows my dad.

269
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:57.490
Let him listen to this because every fucking story I ever tell he fucking Oise

270
00:14:58.311 --> 00:15:00.650
goes,
God damn,
you're fucking imagination.

271
00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:04.730
Not how I would fuck I did not shit my pants.
I Shit a little bit.

272
00:15:04.731 --> 00:15:08.510
I didn't Shit My,
you're making people digging shit my pants.
He just squirts.

273
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.840
He says a little squirter.
I Dunno,
let's call him on the phone.
Do it just,

274
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.900
I didn't even go lucid,
like I didn't try to control it or move around.

275
00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:16.310
I just let the dream play out,

276
00:15:16.311 --> 00:15:18.740
but I realize it was a dream and I still didn't wake up.
I have,

277
00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:23.420
that's a rare thing for me.
Pills just for that.
Chef dreams.

278
00:15:23.421 --> 00:15:26.330
I have dreams,
I have fucking crazy dreams,

279
00:15:26.331 --> 00:15:28.490
but I am totally lucid inside my dreams.

280
00:15:28.491 --> 00:15:32.450
Like I'll dreams that I'm reading something and I'll go,
I'll be going to go.
Wow,

281
00:15:32.451 --> 00:15:35.360
that's so funny that I'm reading something because nothing's there in the dream.

282
00:15:35.361 --> 00:15:38.360
All Pink.
This nothing's there in my mind is making up these words,

283
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.280
but I'm still reading them.
That's so interesting.

284
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:44.060
I had a dream one time that me and Elvis walked into his hotel room and there

285
00:15:44.061 --> 00:15:44.894
were four dudes,

286
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:48.140
<v 1>but fucking right.
Hear me where they were.</v>

287
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.360
<v 0>Just that might be one of the best sentences ever created.</v>

288
00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:56.670
I had a dream that I was with Elvis and we walked into his dressing room.

289
00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:01.060
There was four dudes,
but fucking dot,
dot,
dot.
Now hear me out

290
00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:05.230
<v 1>it weird or they're throwing up in Burger King Cups</v>

291
00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.420
just fucking each other.
And then I do you.
When I say this,

292
00:16:10.421 --> 00:16:13.030
I fucking just shut the door and I looked at Elvis.
I go,

293
00:16:13.031 --> 00:16:16.600
what the fuck's going on in your room?
He said to me,

294
00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:20.310
what's your Dream Baby Shit?

295
00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:26.050
I wake up,
I wake up.
I'm like,
wake up,
check my and make sure it's,
I'm bored.

296
00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:29.590
I'm like,
well,
you really flipped me out.

297
00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:33.700
You don't really flip me out.

298
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:38.160
Not that the guys were both fucking right that find me.
No.

299
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.430
It was the product placement.

300
00:16:39.431 --> 00:16:41.720
Like what the fuck did Burger King do to get in there?

301
00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.950
How the fuck fucking dream?
They

302
00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:49.490
<v 0>figured it out and you just don't know that they is way to interject advertising</v>

303
00:16:49.491 --> 00:16:53.030
into your dreams.
Burger King in the future.

304
00:16:53.031 --> 00:16:55.910
Right now it's like I got her Chrysler stream about the Elvis and the Butt

305
00:16:55.911 --> 00:16:58.250
fucking high,
Huh?
No,
no,
no,
no.
But what is,

306
00:16:58.251 --> 00:17:03.251
there's a possibility that someone could insert a product to a dream,

307
00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:07.220
right?
They could give you a cheeseburger and in that cheeseburger with some

308
00:17:07.221 --> 00:17:11.840
experimental thing that would make you think about burger king in a dream and

309
00:17:11.841 --> 00:17:14.060
see a burger and a dream,
you can do it.
You could do it.

310
00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:18.800
I fucking curl from behind.
It's going Geico and shit.
Yes,
in the future.

311
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.870
But that doesn't make any sense cause he of Pronto duck noises.
It's Geico.

312
00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:26.000
You have to eat something to have this happen to you.
We're still,

313
00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:27.530
we're still missing the whole black.

314
00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:29.630
We're stumbling on something very brilliant right now.

315
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:33.560
Can we get to the flag bill those first cause we might forget.
Yes.
Okay.

316
00:17:33.561 --> 00:17:37.340
Klein dildos.
Here we go.
So I called Joe.
This is what you said.
You Go,

317
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.130
we were just talking about this dude like yeah,

318
00:17:40.131 --> 00:17:42.850
you've got so many crazy stories that have happened to you and it and,
and,

319
00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:44.930
but I never think that,
I think there are just things in my life.

320
00:17:44.931 --> 00:17:45.711
I think it's my ability,

321
00:17:45.711 --> 00:17:48.920
the way I see something happen is different than the way everyone else sees it

322
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:53.010
happen.
You know?
I see the,
the little thing that that registers in me,
I go all,

323
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.270
that's my thing,
you know,

324
00:17:54.271 --> 00:17:58.260
and it lights up for me where my wife just glazes over it and it's come to light

325
00:17:58.261 --> 00:18:00.600
in this podcast more than anything.
The machine,
I mean,

326
00:18:00.601 --> 00:18:02.790
the way I've told the story to fucking a million people,

327
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.650
but then when I told him to do something lit up and I went,
oh,

328
00:18:04.651 --> 00:18:08.310
that is a good story,
right?
The fucking fighting a bear,
the fuck everything.

329
00:18:08.311 --> 00:18:11.520
I'm getting mauled by a bull,
Tracy Morgan,
everything's lights up.

330
00:18:11.521 --> 00:18:14.880
So then I'm talking on the phone today.
I call you,
Hey,

331
00:18:14.881 --> 00:18:18.740
can you do by I and you go.
I said,

332
00:18:18.741 --> 00:18:21.570
I'm on the phone with Delta American Airlines trying to get upgraded.

333
00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:24.200
And you're like,
where are you going?
I said,
Amsterdam.
He said,

334
00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.640
I've never been there.
I said,
oh,
whatever you do,
if you ever go there,

335
00:18:26.641 --> 00:18:29.280
don't go see flying dildos.
True story,
right.
So,

336
00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:33.420
so I'm fucking like 22 I'm an in Amsterdam,

337
00:18:33.421 --> 00:18:35.630
where were the like five friends and there.

338
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:38.880
And of course we do the rounds in Amsterdam and get fucking lit up.

339
00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:44.040
Heineken factory,
hedge hubs.
I think even maybe mushrooms.

340
00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:49.770
We walked by this live sex show and it says on the billboard guy on girl,

341
00:18:49.771 --> 00:18:52.680
girl on girl oral sex,
uh,
this,
this,

342
00:18:52.681 --> 00:18:56.940
this and then the last one is flying dildos.
Come see flying dildos.

343
00:18:56.941 --> 00:18:59.880
Since all Mike fucking,
I tell everyone we're seeing fine dildos.

344
00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:03.060
I want to see fucking flying delta does.
That to me is a showstopper.

345
00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:05.650
That is something that I will buy tickets for everyone for us.

346
00:19:05.651 --> 00:19:08.370
Why buy us all tickets?
We go in to see a live sex show.
Have you ever seen one?

347
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:11.790
No.
It's basically like,
like half a boxing ring.

348
00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:16.260
So it's like you walk in and it's stadium seating and then half a boxing ring

349
00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:19.650
where they just without the ropes and they just,
everything happens right there.

350
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.910
They just fuck it.
Just fuck and oh and our dudes beaten off in the audience.

351
00:19:23.911 --> 00:19:25.290
Are you allowed to wear lipstick?
No.

352
00:19:25.291 --> 00:19:28.010
Dudes aren't beating off in the audience and they know it's a Chi.

353
00:19:28.011 --> 00:19:30.240
It is Kinda creepy now that you say that because I don't know what we were

354
00:19:30.241 --> 00:19:33.500
supposed to do,
but there was like 20 people in there but we just sat in that.

355
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.680
Yeah,
cause I guess maybe you should have been,

356
00:19:34.681 --> 00:19:38.700
but we didn't and we ruined it for everyone.
Um,
so we sit down and they're like,

357
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.880
and the,
they come out and they're like,
the first is um,
girl on girl.

358
00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:45.230
This is just like you'd see a porn,
right?
So two girls come out and they're like,

359
00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:49.950
they got to eat and just taken two girls come out.
I start going flying dildos,

360
00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:54.530
flying duplos and they're like,
no,
we're not playing dildos.
I go,
oh,

361
00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:57.000
now do what guys are like,
well I want to see flying dildos too.

362
00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:00.390
So they do their thing,
they leave.
A girl comes out by herself,

363
00:20:00.391 --> 00:20:04.180
masturbation and I go flying dildos and she goes,
no,
I'm not flying dildos.

364
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.390
I fucking,
everyone that came to the stage,
I just yelled flying dildos.

365
00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.100
How many people came to the day and like nine acts,
nine acts come to the stage.

366
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.380
How long is each one doing?
Five minutes.

367
00:20:13.381 --> 00:20:16.770
And fucking masturbating and then eating each other out and then blowing a dude.

368
00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:19.830
And then they got folks,
the girl that's like the headliner,
right?
Like,

369
00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.480
and we get to the guy fucking the girl and I'm like,

370
00:20:21.481 --> 00:20:25.170

And the guy's like,
we're not fleeing dildos.

371
00:20:25.171 --> 00:20:29.020
Okay.
Stop with the fucking playing dildos.
And I'm like,
I'm like,

372
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:31.350

373
00:20:31.351 --> 00:20:34.200
But well now we've got 20 dudes and they're all on my team because they're

376
00:20:42.181 --> 00:20:44.460

00:20:44.461 --> 00:20:47.560

382
00:21:03.431 --> 00:21:07.600
And everyone's like,

Of course he did.

It was a fucking nightmare.
So we'll have a photo of this.

395

406
00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.860
Do you ever go to its best PJ face?
I've ever seen him.
Like,

407
00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:36.710
did you,
what did you give him before the show?
So I had no idea.
I have,

408
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:41.020
I have no idea.
He's extra silly.
Silly.
Yeah.

409
00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:46.200
<v 1>In Burbank.
There's wild parrots,
like a gang of wild parrots.
I,
yeah,</v>

410
00:22:46.201 --> 00:22:50.450
I've seen them and they,
it's the loudest thing ever out of nowhere.

411
00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.470
It sounds like murder outside of your house.
Whoa.
That's weird.
Yeah.

412
00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.030
And if you look online,

413
00:22:56.031 --> 00:22:59.000
there's websites devoted to them and stuff and they look just like normal

414
00:22:59.001 --> 00:23:02.510
parrots,
but they just go around in this huge gang and just,

415
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:07.110
that's pretty screen.
I remember we,
uh,
worked at the,
um,

416
00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:11.900
West Palm Beach Improv,
the old one way back in the day and uh,

417
00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.330
I they put you up at this condo was me and Matt.
Okay.

418
00:23:14.331 --> 00:23:18.300
Maddie Kirsch and we looked out the window and this fucking like parrots,

419
00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:23.550
like actual parents on this power line.
I'm like,
dude,

420
00:23:23.551 --> 00:23:27.900
there's like real parrots out here.
Like this is the weirdest shit ever.

421
00:23:27.901 --> 00:23:31.890
Like their parakeets and parents.
And I'm like,
these are like tropical birds.

422
00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:35.940
Like Miami's tropics.
It is the tropics.
It is a tropics.
Yeah.

423
00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:40.320
It's barely America.
Right.
Let's be realistic.

424
00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:45.000
It's too awesome to be America.
Too crazy and too,

425
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:49.880
Cubans got in and just made it tropical.
Tropical.
We're going to Cuba,

426
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:55.220
Cuba,
do a trip to Cuba.
Oh Dude,
I'd want to kill me.

427
00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:59.030
Opened up relations as well.
The best thing about the show right now.
Yeah.
Yeah.

428
00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.400
I would love to.
Yeah.
Those parakeets are parents.
What are the,

429
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:05.370
these are the Burbank parrots.
Yeah.
These are actual words.
Actual parents.
Yeah.

430
00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:09.950
They come from down because of Youtube.
What?
Oh No,

431
00:24:09.951 --> 00:24:13.730
these are just still pictures.
Oh did they come from people that were,
uh,

432
00:24:13.731 --> 00:24:17.150
that had him as pat?
Sir.
What'd they come from?
You know,
they,
there's no,

433
00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.790
there's just rumors because Disney's there said,

434
00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.500
lot of people think that Walt Disney's,

435
00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:25.520
it was Walt Disney's parrots and he just says it.
Shall we find out they're fake.

436
00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.900
They're now Paris.
Walt Disney is such a motherfucker.

437
00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:34.100
He's got fake parents out there flying around.
Shitting on people.

438
00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:37.160
Yeah.
I had a bird,

439
00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:40.700
had bird feeders out I bought recently and they found out about it and now they

440
00:24:40.701 --> 00:24:44.760
won't leave my house alone.
They're there like every day.
The amazing,
yeah.

441
00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:48.130
That's cool dude.
That's pretty dope.
Yeah.
They're loud.
Too loud.

442
00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:52.460
They're annoying as fuck.
No floods on.
Yeah.
Put that,

443
00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:57.020
let them into your spiritual compass.
Yeah.
Bring them into your center.
I will.

444
00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:00.030
That seems like an amazing thing to have in your neighborhood,
man.
Oh,

445
00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:03.890
that's cool.
And it's really cool because it's a,
I live in a question place.

446
00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:08.900
So there's horses and parrots must smell awesome horse shit and bird shit all

447
00:25:10.191 --> 00:25:14.600
stood up together.
And the Burbank son,
how is it that it's illegal?

448
00:25:14.601 --> 00:25:16.250
If you don't clean up after your dog,

449
00:25:16.251 --> 00:25:20.270
but you're allowed to just have your fucking horse shit everywhere.
She's empty.

450
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:22.140
It's giant asshole.

451
00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:26.360
1200 pound body of stewed grasses.

452
00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:37.100
Brian,
I'm sorry.
Is this cobblestone?
Is this a dirt road?
You farmer?
Fuck.

453
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:41.660
Pick up after that donkey.
Your donkey.
Just Shit.

454
00:25:41.661 --> 00:25:46.310
All of my previous
dog,
he's not that green.

455
00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.530
This is contributing to global warming.

456
00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:55.620
Donkey was dirty ass.
All Brian said he didn't like Paris in his neighborhood.

457
00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:58.630
He's in bed with the chicken.
It's like the bears.

458
00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:00.730
<v 2>I never said</v>

459
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:09.340
I have done this before.
Oh my God.

460
00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:27.050
They're bringing the fucking parrots into the courthouse.

461
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:33.190
We would now like to call prosecution witness the Burbank Paris.

462
00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:39.800
I've never seen this before.
No.
Roofie what are you talking about?

463
00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.170
Oh,
no,
two heads is fine.

464
00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:49.650
I take two hits all the time and I drive

465
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:52.350
ingrown hair.

466
00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:57.750
You know,

467
00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:02.870
all you need to do is you needed to do she with that stuff like that stuff kills

468
00:27:03.901 --> 00:27:04.734
everything.

469
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:15.580
<v 1>How about,
how about the,
the defense attorney and the judge goes badgering,</v>

470
00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:20.230
badgering the witness and the objection,
and then brush.
Here he goes,
hmm.

471
00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.870
Probably want to Greg too far.
Too Far.

472
00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:30.390
<v 3>Okay.</v>
