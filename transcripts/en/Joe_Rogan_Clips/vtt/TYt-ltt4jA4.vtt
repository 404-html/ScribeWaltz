WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.620
You and I,
we share African ancestry.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was shocked.
Yeah.

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.700
I'm 1.6%.
All right.
Yeah.
See I have more,
uh,
uh,

3
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.600
I have more credential than you in that department.
You're 2% right.
Yeah,
I know.

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.530
And it's,
it's funny because,
uh,
you know,
you sort of have your,

5
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.280
the story in your family kind of like where he came from and everything mates.

6
00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:25.150
And I always knew I was 25%,
you know,
Italian.
Uh,

7
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.180
and I knew that my family came from Sicily and in fact,
uh,
the,
the,

8
00:00:30.181 --> 00:00:33.960
the Rinella is that came from Sicily all seemed to become kind of established in

9
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.990
the,
in the produce world.
Uh,

10
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.950
my dad was brought up in the south side of Chicago.

11
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.400
I'm 44 years old.
Okay.
So think about that for a minute.

12
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.700
My Dad was brought up in the south side of Chicago and he was raised by his

13
00:00:48.701 --> 00:00:51.850
grandfather who is Sicilian and come from Sicily.

14
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.560
His grandfather delivered produce with a horse and cart.

15
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.950
Whoa.
In Chicago.
So,

16
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.900
<v 1>yeah,</v>

17
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.010
<v 0>to have lived through that,</v>

18
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.400
like to be brought up in a house where a guy like leaves in the morning and a

19
00:01:06.401 --> 00:01:09.670
horse and cart to deliver,
produce an end to be alive.

20
00:01:09.671 --> 00:01:14.380
Like to fight in World War II,
to be through the atomic era,

21
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.580
the advent of the Internet.
Right.

22
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.530
But I always knew that we had Sicilians when I did the genetic test,

23
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.170
what some of those,
at some point in time,

24
00:01:26.171 --> 00:01:31.171
one of those Sicilians must have shot southward and cross the Mediterranean and

25
00:01:32.351 --> 00:01:34.450
like had a hookup down there,
something,
well,

26
00:01:34.451 --> 00:01:37.130
that was the history of Sicily in the first place.
Yeah.

27
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.240
Sicily if just being Sicilian in the first place.

28
00:01:40.241 --> 00:01:42.850
There was so many people that were,
uh,

29
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.180
impregnated by the Moore's and by various people of West Africa and North

30
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.360
Africa.
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.
I should've probably like always assumed,
but it just,

31
00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:56.650
I hadn't thought about it.
Um,
another thing I was reading about this stuff,

32
00:01:56.651 --> 00:02:00.100
and you might know more about it than I do,
is that when you do those tasks,

33
00:02:00.101 --> 00:02:04.810
there's missing parts.
You know,
it does it like it captures what's there,

34
00:02:04.811 --> 00:02:08.410
but there's could be a lot of there that's not captured just in a way that

35
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.230
chromosomes are,
you know,
inherited and passed down like it's not,

36
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:17.950
it's an incomplete picture.
Right,
right.
There could be influences.
There could,

37
00:02:17.951 --> 00:02:22.060
there could be in your,
and it doesn't create a full picture of your lineage.

38
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.980
There could be lineages that are there that aren't represented in your

39
00:02:26.981 --> 00:02:30.790
particular makeup.
How so?
Like what do you mean?

40
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.270
You know,
I hate to right off the bat,

41
00:02:34.271 --> 00:02:37.240
get into somethings that I can't speak about any level of expertise.

42
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.020
I was just reading a piece and the piece I was reading had to do,

43
00:02:41.021 --> 00:02:45.760
it was kind of a dissection of like what happened with Elizabeth Warren would,

44
00:02:45.761 --> 00:02:49.300
she claimed we even going off about that on the podcast and I'm like a hundred

45
00:02:49.301 --> 00:02:53.350
times more African than she is native American.
Yeah.
Well that's what I found.

46
00:02:53.351 --> 00:02:57.600
I'm 10 times more or whatever.
But it was a piece about it.
It was a,

47
00:02:57.601 --> 00:03:02.350
it was a piece in the times explaining like how to make sense of now that

48
00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:05.800
everyone's doing these tasks,
like how to think about,
make sense,
these tests.
But,

49
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:09.420
but my understanding of it is,
um,

50
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
that you could have a lot of ancestry that just isn't captured in your genetic

51
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:19.540
code and the way that would be detected through the testing.

52
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.990
Meaning there could be ancestors.
It for what?
Cause you're inheriting half,

53
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.130
you know,
your Harrington chromosomes from each parent and,

54
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.720
and somehow you could have,
it could be an incomplete picture.

55
00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:31.990
You could have ancestors that had come from all the,
you know,
whatever these,

56
00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:36.820
these tests break out the world and do a hundred or some odd regions or zones

57
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.230
that there could be people from those zones who are in your lineage that are not

58
00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:45.160
captured in your personal,
that are not captured in your genetic code.

59
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.820
That's so bizarre.
You would think it would all be in there.
So that's just a,

60
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:52.060
an incomplete measuring tool.
Is that what it is?

61
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.660
Or is it just actually not in there?
I Dunno.

62
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.310
You're going to have to have a dude on,
I'll listen.

63
00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.500
You need to have a dude on and it,
and as I say,

64
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:01.480
I feel like I'm off on a bad start here,
man.

65
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.370
How much a neanderthal did it say less than normal.
Really less than average.

66
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:09.730
The,
uh,
the number,
like it said,
it gives you,
you did 23 and me,
right?

67
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.950
I can't remember.
I can't remember.

68
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:14.200
I just remember it was less than average and you know,

69
00:04:14.201 --> 00:04:17.980
and those things like our refined by how many people do them,
you know,

70
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.520
but it was less than average,
which bummed me out.
But I'm like,

71
00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:25.120
is Harry is like a 13 year old,
like Norwegian girl?
You know what I mean?

72
00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:28.690
So that didn't surprise.
Shocking then surprise me too much.
