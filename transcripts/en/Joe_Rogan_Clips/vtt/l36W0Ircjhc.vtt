1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.840
The joe rogan experience.
Well,
this is another thing that we talked about,
uh,

2
00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.680
on the flight that I think is important to bring up.

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.700
Remember when there was this talk about the state monument or the National

4
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:15.120
Monument in Utah and a Patagonia put that thing on their page.

5
00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:17.030
The president's stole your land.
Yeah.

6
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.370
Explain what actually happened because it's not what everybody thinks it is.

7
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.850
And Rinella said it best.
If you say the president stole your land,

8
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.480
you're not being accurate with your words.
That's not what happened.

9
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.540
It was Patagonia did an awesome marketing job I made and that there was efforts

10
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.400
by saying the present sold your land form.

11
00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:41.910
What I've heard resulted in a 15% increase in business for them.

12
00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:44.820
So it worked great.
But with the truth is,

13
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.470
is a lot of people felt like Obama when he,
before he left office,
did,

14
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.880
um,
an overreach on the national monument protection.

15
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.320
And so there's protecting the national monument and then,

16
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.550
which is a certain area he protected.
He wanted,

17
00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:06.570
it encompassed 2 million acres in that national monument designation,

18
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.490
which seems excessive.
What Zinky says,
the secretary of Interior,

19
00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:14.730
he went in there and he said,
that's an excessive,
that's an overreach.

20
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.610
I want to scale it back to what it was before Obama did that.

21
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.970
Now why is it excessive though?
This is what gets confusing to people.

22
00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:23.820
People think that protecting land is never excessive,
right?

23
00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:28.140
What he wants to do is make sure people have access and what,
and it's like,
okay,

24
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.820
so what's the difference between the Wa the way it is under Obama and the way it

25
00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:37.380
is under Zinky?
It'll be Zinky scaled it back to what it was before,

26
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.220
which that would be,
it's still national forest,
still federal land.

27
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.170
But you'd be able to,
and I'm not sure if it,

28
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.450
if it was wilderness or how the access would be what,

29
00:01:48.451 --> 00:01:53.040
but what Zinky would say is that like I would be able to go into the land all

30
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:54.660
the time if that 2 million acres,

31
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.810
because I might be considered by some to be elite,
you know,

32
00:01:57.811 --> 00:01:59.970
because I can walk for 20 miles.

33
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.150
Not Everybody in the United States can walk 20 miles to get somewhere.

34
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.500
So they want to put road systems.

35
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:09.360
There's road systems already already but wants to maintain the roads.
So,

36
00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:14.010
but if it was a national monument,
right then no road systems.

37
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:18.000
Like what is the difference that I think the road systems would be gated off and

38
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:23.001
it'd be walking and checking own foot track traffic only instead of access

39
00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:24.600
through the roads.

40
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.540
Now why did Obama make it 2 million acres and close off the roads?

41
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.260
I'm not sure.
So it's still federal land.

42
00:02:31.261 --> 00:02:36.120
So it's not like the government sold the land off now and no mining permits have

43
00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:40.140
been issued and there's no plans to drill or anything like that?
No.
When I,

44
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.250
when I looked that up because I was unsure about it and I talked with Zinky

45
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.700
about it just because it's,
you know,
I'm learning all this as we go also.

46
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.290
And I was concerned when,
when I read the president's told your Atlanta,
I'm like,

47
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:56.850
what's this about?
Um,
and so,
uh,
what,
what it is,

48
00:02:56.851 --> 00:03:01.851
is what he was Zinky wants to do is he wants to just make sure people have not

49
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:05.470
all abilities.
Cause it's not like we want roads on every mountain,

50
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.920
but have access to two national forests.

51
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.000
<v 1>People that can drive in four by fours.
You know those little off road</v>

52
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.000
<v 0>on existing roads,
on existing roads and it's just like national forest now.</v>

53
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.520
Natural force now has roads,
right,
right.

54
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.750
Designated wilderness areas because then I talked about that too.
I'm like,
well,

55
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:30.370
okay,
I understand,
I understand access.
I said,
that's great.

56
00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:32.710
I want people to be able to enjoy the great outdoors also.

57
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.130
But I also grew up hunting the Eagle cap wilderness,

58
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.130
which is Oregon's largest wilderness area,

59
00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:43.240
356,000 acres of no roads and I don't want roads in there.

60
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.750
I don't want access in the middle of the heart of that wilderness because of

61
00:03:48.841 --> 00:03:52.630
some of the most pristine,
beautiful country in the lower 48 I like it like that.

62
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:56.470
So we still need to build to protect those areas.

63
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.460
But this wasn't in this one.
This is bears ears and and Utah.

64
00:04:00.461 --> 00:04:03.510
This wasn't changing anything opening up anything or,

65
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.260
or this big nefarious plan of of mining and stripping everything out of the

66
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.220
right word.
But all it did,
it went back to what it was before.

67
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.790
And at that time when our research that there had been no mining permits,

68
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.940
that from what I understand is there is no mineral,
there's not an,

69
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:19.960
there's minerals in there,

70
00:04:19.961 --> 00:04:24.770
but not enough to warrant going in there and setting up a full mineral mineral

71
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.230
extraction mine.

72
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.240
<v 1>So the building,</v>

73
00:04:27.241 --> 00:04:31.230
the reason that they changed the distinction is to allow people to have more

74
00:04:31.231 --> 00:04:33.590
access to that wilderness through roads that already,
right.

75
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.390
<v 0>So windy wilderness,
it'd be national forest.
Okay.
The federal lands.
Yeah.
So</v>

76
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.170
<v 1>why the uproar then?
Like why is everybody so confused?</v>

77
00:04:41.171 --> 00:04:42.760
Is it a lack of communication?

78
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.570
Is it a lack of understanding about what the difference in the distinctions of

79
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:47.410
the two things are?

80
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.270
<v 0>It,
it's just creating a,
you know,</v>

81
00:04:50.271 --> 00:04:54.980
a negative narrative as it's saying it's something changed,
you know,

82
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.910
Obama had at this way,
uh,
Zinky scaled it back.

83
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.450
That right there is like,
why,
what's going on?

84
00:05:02.451 --> 00:05:04.790
Not really doing the research about,
he's not,

85
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.000
he's just putting it back to what it was because he thought that it was an

86
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.860
overreach by Obama.
So it's just,
you know,
these,
these outfits,

87
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.840
they're in business.
Um,
you know,
if everything's going good,

88
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.270
there's really no reason for people to get fired up and contribute money.

89
00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.700
You know,
some of these,
some of these it's political in some respects,
businesses,

90
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.080
political.
Um,
it's

91
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.300
<v 1>very cynical though.
I,
I see what you're saying,</v>

92
00:05:31.301 --> 00:05:35.950
but I think that really what's going on is people are very concerned and they

93
00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:39.540
see any move,
main check concern businesses.
Yeah.

94
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.030
But even the businesses like Patagonia's businesses about the outdoors,

95
00:05:43.031 --> 00:05:43.960
that's their whole business.

96
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260
So they see anything that's a change in the Trump administration,

97
00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:49.330
especially in the beginning when it came in,

98
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.470
people were really worried about them in terms of environmental concerns.
Right.

99
00:05:53.471 --> 00:05:55.330
Because they had opened up offshore drilling.

100
00:05:55.331 --> 00:05:57.770
They had done a lot of things that people were really out about.

101
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.810
They had opened up,
what was the area,

102
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.900
Jamie in Alaska where they were going to open up drilling that was near a salmon

103
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:08.630
runs that people were very,
very concerned about.

104
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.060
They were concerned about the idea of money above nature like,

105
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.610
and then me to,
right.
And who's making that money?
You're not making money.

106
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.870
I'm not making any of that money.

107
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.960
So someone else is going to make money off of what's supposed to be our land and

108
00:06:23.061 --> 00:06:26.330
our public land,
which you and I could maybe go.

109
00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:29.660
Even though you don't like salmon,
we could go salmon fishing in this land.
Well,

110
00:06:29.661 --> 00:06:34.520
it could get fucked up by someone else making billions of dollars in oil or

111
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:37.340
natural gas or whatever the fuck we do.
If they contaminate that.

112
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.350
I don't want that.
No,
I don't want,
you don't want that either.

113
00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:41.270
And the people from Patagonia,
you don't want that either.

114
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.810
So when they see something like this come up there,
red flags go up.

115
00:06:44.811 --> 00:06:45.940
They want to get people outraged.

116
00:06:45.941 --> 00:06:49.130
They want to get people activated because they think that they might be a chance

117
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.280
that if you protest enough,

118
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.660
you can stop something like this happening before it does.
Right.

119
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.230
Because if you do look at like what happened in Alaska with that big oil spill

120
00:06:57.231 --> 00:07:01.340
in the 80s or what happened with the BP oil spill in the Gulf coast,

121
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.850
that shit's devastating.
When something like that does happen,

122
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.190
someone else is profiting,

123
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:09.950
making fucking billions of dollars while our,

124
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.400
our planet that we all share is getting fucked up.

125
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.520
You're not making a nickel off of it.
I'm not making a nickel off of it.

126
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:21.410
They're making billions of dollars and they're fucking up the land and by the

127
00:07:21.411 --> 00:07:24.320
government,
by Trump or anybody else,
whoever's opening it up,

128
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.560
giving them access to drill,
right,
to do all those things,

129
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.680
you open up the possibility of ruining something that's amazing.

130
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:35.350
<v 0>Well,
so there's always going to be a balance though.
There's,
you can't just say,</v>

131
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.190
okay,
nobody can drive past this point forever.
You know what I mean?

132
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.550
There's always so,
but you're saying that about the Eagle cap wilderness.

133
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.980
You don't want them to drive past gotta be areas.

134
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.390
There's gotta be areas we have to protect wilderness areas,
but for example,

135
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.920
where we've elk hunting in Colorado,
right?
Big Bowls.
Awesome.
Elk Hunting.

136
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.900
There's natural gas wells all over,
right?
It's great elk hunting.
Yeah,

137
00:07:58.901 --> 00:08:01.830
they've got,
so there's a valid,
they're not,
yeah,
they're not fucking it up.
So,

138
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.930
yeah,
I don't want things wiped out in a,

139
00:08:04.931 --> 00:08:09.931
in a huge mineral extraction mine where there's used to be beautiful,

140
00:08:10.061 --> 00:08:12.760
whatever,
right.
Don't want that forever.
Or is it a pollutant?

141
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:17.140
But you can't just say,
we're not doing anything anywhere.
It doesn't work.

142
00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:20.200
So there can be a balance just like where are we've hunted in Colorado.

143
00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.390
There can be a balance,
but the real concern

144
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:26.840
<v 1>that the average person has me included is that someone is going to profit and</v>

145
00:08:26.841 --> 00:08:30.710
by doing that we're where it's not going to benefit you or anybody.

146
00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:34.510
We know it's going to fuck it up for everybody else.
Yeah.
That's the real

147
00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:38.570
<v 0>concern for sure.
I know.
That's why I've tried to,
you know,</v>

148
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:42.410
that's what I've wondered to be involved.
Like I'm on that council,

149
00:08:42.411 --> 00:08:45.590
which has nothing to do with public lands in North America,

150
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.260
but it's given me a way to get in there and try to learn more.

151
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:49.123
That's all I'm trying to.

152
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:54.190
<v 1>Well you also were involved with it when Jason Chaffetz had that proposal in</v>

153
00:08:54.621 --> 00:08:56.250
Utah to sell off

154
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.960
<v 0>chunks of public land.</v>

155
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.100
You were one of the people that sat down with him and got his take on it.

156
00:09:02.101 --> 00:09:07.050
And ultimately because the outcry from people who love the outdoors and hunters

157
00:09:07.051 --> 00:09:11.600
and fishermen,
that was stopped.
Yeah.
Which is very interesting.
And Jason,
uh,

158
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.810
he took a lot of shit,
but he seems like a very reasonable guy.
I think so too.

159
00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:19.620
It's um,
you know,
he's out of politics now.
What is he doing?

160
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:24.480
He's on Fox News.
Oh,
he's a correspondent.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's so,
he's completely,

161
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:29.220
he was a congressman out of Utah and I went back to DC and talk to talk to him.

162
00:09:29.221 --> 00:09:31.350
That was HR six 22 and that was,

163
00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:36.570
they wanted to sell what they determined disposable public land.

164
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:41.130
And I'm like,
okay,
wait a second.
Who says what's disposable?

165
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.530
Cause what's disposable to you?
Might not be to me.

166
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.710
Maybe it's a great hunting area.
So I didn't really like,

167
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.500
there wasn't really a way to determine what was disposable.
Right.

168
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:52.890
That's what caught my attention and other,
not just mine,

169
00:09:52.891 --> 00:09:57.060
but even people like Steve Rinella in a lot of people in the loop and in the

170
00:09:57.061 --> 00:10:01.650
know.
And I got advice from,
um,
let's see,

171
00:10:01.651 --> 00:10:05.830
Randy Nuber,
Stever Nela,
Jill Webster at the,
uh,

172
00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:10.800
uh,
Theater,
Roosevelt concert,
uh,
conservation conservation program.

173
00:10:10.801 --> 00:10:13.110
All those guys are really experts in the field,

174
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.630
back country hunters and anglers talk to them.
I did.

175
00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:21.720
People were super active about getting people to complain and protest this.

176
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:25.320
And so that one that I did get a chance to go back there and I did a podcast

177
00:10:25.321 --> 00:10:29.970
with a [inaudible] and yeah,
he pulled it.
It was gone.
Never happened.

178
00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.470
But yes,
that's,
I mean,

179
00:10:31.471 --> 00:10:36.471
we just need to be educated on it and I just don't like the,

180
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.850
I dunno,
without that education jumping,
jumping in on the bandwagon and saying,

181
00:10:41.851 --> 00:10:45.600
yeah,
the president stole my land.
It's like,
is that even true?
Well,
you know,

182
00:10:45.601 --> 00:10:48.900
I always defer to Rinella when it comes to things like this because he's so well

183
00:10:48.901 --> 00:10:52.080
versed in it.
So when he said that you're not being accurate with your words,

184
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:53.550
I had to look into it deeper,

185
00:10:53.551 --> 00:10:55.710
but I didn't really understand it totally until I was talking to you.

186
00:10:55.711 --> 00:11:00.090
And you were explaining to me the distinction between how it was before Obama

187
00:11:00.091 --> 00:11:00.924
was in office.

188
00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:05.130
Obama changed and then bringing it back to how it was before.

189
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:08.160
So it's still federal land.
No one sold it off.
No it's not.

190
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:12.150
It's just giving people more access to roads but amazing how when something like

191
00:11:12.151 --> 00:11:16.620
that happens,
this is gigantic outcry.
Yeah.
And everybody freaks out.
Yeah.

192
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:20.010
It's uh,
it's confusing.
It can be confusing.

193
00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:22.910
Cause I'll read two different things and I'll be like,
oh my God,

194
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:26.760
what is it this or is it that's going on?
I don't know.
Yeah.
So that's where I,

195
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:30.720
you know,
when people say,
oh well Zinky he was lying to your face.
I'm like,
ah,

196
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:35.070
I don't know maybe,
but on video,
you doubt it.
I don't,

197
00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:39.490
he doesn't seem like that guy.
He,
he seems like he's a straight shooter.
You know,

198
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:40.620
I asked him about,

199
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:46.100
he was getting beat up because the national parks advisory board wouldn't,

200
00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:52.470
he wouldn't meet with them.
That's what it was.
And so he got said,
you know,
Zeke,

201
00:11:52.471 --> 00:11:56.170
he doesn't care national parks and he won't meet with the advisory board.

202
00:11:56.171 --> 00:11:59.800
And so I asked him about that because that was in the news and that was just

203
00:11:59.801 --> 00:12:02.890
like,
man,
he,
maybe he doesn't care about public land,
you know,
I mean,

204
00:12:02.891 --> 00:12:06.550
I didn't know what was going on,
so I wanted to ask him about that.
And I'm like,

205
00:12:06.551 --> 00:12:10.330
well,
they resigned in protest because you wouldn't meet with him.
What was that?

206
00:12:10.331 --> 00:12:13.450
And he goes,
well,
yeah,
you're right.
I wouldn't meet with them.
He goes,

207
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:18.430
here's how it went.
I came in as secretary of interior and in charge of,

208
00:12:18.431 --> 00:12:19.930
I don't know how many different councils,

209
00:12:19.931 --> 00:12:23.220
just like the international one I'm on in this park advisory board that what

210
00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:27.400
we're talking about.
And there's I think 200 and some that he's,
he really,

211
00:12:27.401 --> 00:12:31.450
I think he over,
I don't even know,
thousands of employees,

212
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:36.430
billions of dollars.
And all he asked was for these advisory boards.

213
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:40.270
He wanted,
um,
a report written up that said,

214
00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.550
what have you done in the last two years?

215
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.820
What are you working on now and what your goals for the next two years.

216
00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:48.280
Once you provide me with that report,

217
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.430
then I'll get up to speed and I'll meet with you.
They never did it.

218
00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:56.470
So he didn't meet with them and that was it.
That said the story was he,

219
00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.080
he wouldn't meet with them and they resigned in protest,

220
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.370
but the other half of the story was he asked them to do something so he could

221
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:07.840
get up to speed and be educated on what's going on and he never supplied it.

222
00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:08.990
<v 1>Well,</v>

223
00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:13.990
if they are the typical government employees and what is the typical government

224
00:13:14.751 --> 00:13:18.170
employee?
Incompetent.
Lazy.
I'm a government,

225
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:24.990
but typical.
Oh,
what do people think of?

226
00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:27.380
They think of incompetent,
lazy,

227
00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:32.280
entitled bureaucrats and they've got this job and like all of,

228
00:13:32.281 --> 00:13:36.650
and he's asking them to provide,
not,
not just tell them what they've done,

229
00:13:36.651 --> 00:13:41.330
but tell them what they're going to do and provide like a framework for the

230
00:13:41.331 --> 00:13:45.080
future.
That makes,
that's a lot of work.
Yeah.
When someone's a lazy fuck,

231
00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.640
if he was just kind of half ass and your job is just showing up and I'm not

232
00:13:49.641 --> 00:13:52.820
saying they are,
I don't know.
I didn't know him.
Also,

233
00:13:52.821 --> 00:13:57.200
they might have resented him for whatever their preconceived notions of who he

234
00:13:57.201 --> 00:14:00.570
is coming into this job.
And they were,
um,

235
00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.040
I don't know if all 12 of them,
I think there's 12.
I don't,

236
00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:07.430
but I think they were all democrat.
Oh,
the son of a bitches.

237
00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:11.990
So obviously he's a Republican.
He's,
he's gone unpaid volunteers.

238
00:14:11.991 --> 00:14:16.880
Also unpaid unpaid volunteers.
I'm an unpaid volunteer on that council.

239
00:14:16.881 --> 00:14:19.940
It's like you don't do this for money.
You do it to make a difference.
Yeah.

240
00:14:19.941 --> 00:14:21.260
But if they're going to be a volunteer,

241
00:14:21.261 --> 00:14:24.020
even if there are unpaid volunteer and if he asks you to have a plan,

242
00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:27.710
you should probably have a plan.
Otherwise,
why have,
why are you doing it?

243
00:14:27.711 --> 00:14:31.540
Because I guarantee you there's someone out there that would have a plan.
Yeah.

244
00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:36.290
And especially when it comes to something that's important as national parks and

245
00:14:36.291 --> 00:14:40.550
public land,
things that are like really dear and important to people.
Yeah.

246
00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:45.470
This is something that,
you know,
you want to have whoever these volunteers are,

247
00:14:45.471 --> 00:14:48.290
if you're going to appoint them,
you want to have the best ones for the job.

248
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:52.130
Right.
So it's asking someone to write a plan up and that's if that's

249
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:56.090
<v 0>the only reasons.
He's tough because we don't have their take on it.
Well,
I've,</v>

250
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.050
I read what they wrote and what did they write?

251
00:14:58.051 --> 00:15:02.240
You just said that he wouldn't meet with them and whatever.
So he wouldn't read,

252
00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:04.940
meet with them until they did what he asked.
They didn't say that.

253
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:09.050
He told me that,
but that's what he said.
Right.
Yeah.
Well that makes sense.
Yeah.

254
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:11.990
I mean,
I'm kind of in his camp,

255
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:15.410
that's if we're looking at it 100% accurately.
Yeah,
no.

256
00:15:15.411 --> 00:15:18.890
And he told me face to face,
that's what happened.
So I mean,
you know,
you can say,

257
00:15:18.891 --> 00:15:20.570
well,
I don't believe anybody,
I don't believe,

258
00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:21.920
I don't believe what you just told me.

259
00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.530
I don't believe that at some point you have to be like,
man,

260
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.320
it seemed like he was telling me the truth and I believe it.

261
00:15:27.321 --> 00:15:29.000
And that makes sense.
Yeah.

262
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:33.200
It does make sense that they would not want to do that,
you know?
Yeah.

263
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:34.650
What have you been working on?
Well Chuck,

264
00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.080
my room room going for book when I'm work,

265
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:43.410
sometimes we get pine cones.
Yeah.
So I mean,

266
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:48.710
to me he seems like hardworking,
pretty demanding.
Um,

267
00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:52.280
but he cares.
I mean,
he's in there trying to,

268
00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:57.790
so the secretary of interior before Zinky I had no,
I'm like,
what?

269
00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:00.050
I don't even know what that is.
You know,
so that's,

270
00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:04.280
that's what kind of involvement that person had in hunter,

271
00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.670
in the lives of hunting.
People like me are fishermen.

272
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.770
And so when I didn't even know who it wasn't,

273
00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:15.040
come to find out her name was Sally jewel who was Obama's appointee before Trump

274
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.940
appointed Zinky.
Um,
so I liked the fact that Zinky is at shot show.

275
00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:21.290
He's had me out there.

276
00:16:21.291 --> 00:16:25.310
I'm on this council is at least I have a seat at the table to say,

277
00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.650
and I don't know,
I might get kicked off this council.

278
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:30.620
I might never get invited back because I'll ask him,

279
00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:34.070
so what's going on with this?
But right now I have a seat at the table.

280
00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:38.180
So whatever it's,
it's,
I,
I consider that a win.

281
00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:42.050
At least I can try to find out and learn.
Yeah.
It's,
it's,

282
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:46.640
it's an interesting thing because everything that I've heard about him that I've

283
00:16:46.641 --> 00:16:48.170
read in the media,
uh,

284
00:16:48.171 --> 00:16:51.650
unless I'm reading like a hunting website or something like that.
Yeah.

285
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.160
Everything I've heard is like that it's a horror show that he's bringing on all

286
00:16:55.161 --> 00:16:56.360
these trophy hunters.

287
00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:00.240
And there was an article acquainting you with being a,

288
00:17:00.241 --> 00:17:04.510
a trophy hunter and that this council that he's put together is just this

289
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:09.850
disgusting sort of justification for trophy hunting and that they're only

290
00:17:09.921 --> 00:17:12.860
putting it together so that wealthy people can bring back their elephants that

291
00:17:12.861 --> 00:17:17.390
they shoot in Africa.
Yup.
Yup.
I've read that too.
I mean,
for me,
and I'm not,

292
00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:21.410
you know,
I've never killed an elephant.
I've never killed a lion,
um,

293
00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.830
in every purse.
So even the people on the council that have,

294
00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.380
they do care about animals,
they care.

295
00:17:27.381 --> 00:17:32.381
They're volunteers just like on the parks advisory board and there they want to

296
00:17:32.661 --> 00:17:35.720
make a positive difference.
You know,
I know every person on that.

297
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.340
I don't know every person personally,

298
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.590
but I know they care about the people of Africa and that's why they understand

299
00:17:42.591 --> 00:17:46.130
how it works.
They've been there,
they've seen it.
Um,

300
00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:51.240
the guys who I've hunted with their personally awesome people,

301
00:17:51.241 --> 00:17:53.330
hardworking people.
Um,
the,

302
00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:56.640
the one guy on my last trip there to Tanzania,

303
00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.900
his daughter was in college and he'd been a professional hunter over there for

304
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:05.640
over 20 or 30 years and she was going to college now getting her degree.

305
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:08.910
I mean explain what a professional hunter over there is not what we think about

306
00:18:08.911 --> 00:18:09.660
it over here.

307
00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.750
Well we think of over here a professional hunter be a guy who hunts,
oh,

308
00:18:12.751 --> 00:18:16.470
that's what it is.
Essentially a guide,
a guide.

309
00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:20.250
They call him phs are professional hunters.
So I mean,

310
00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.790
because of hunting,
he's able to send his,

311
00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:28.110
his daughter to college and I mean,
and now that's gone.
Yeah.

312
00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.910
I mean I'm not saying every person,
a lot of them.
A lot of them.
Yeah.
And there,

313
00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:35.820
it's not getting any better because right now,
so that policy,

314
00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:40.470
Trump said,
well,
we're going to review it on a case by case basis.

315
00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:44.070
So he didn't say,
he didn't say,
okay,
it's legal now.

316
00:18:44.071 --> 00:18:47.040
Everybody can hunt and and go and bring the trophies back.
He said,

317
00:18:47.041 --> 00:18:48.960
we'll review each one a case by case basis.

318
00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:52.890
So that still doesn't make it that good for a hunter because they say,
well,

319
00:18:52.891 --> 00:18:55.080
I'm not going to book a hunt if I don't know for a fact.

320
00:18:55.081 --> 00:18:58.350
I can bring my trophy back.
Yeah.
So it's not really that much better.

321
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:08.370
<v 2>Yeah.</v>
