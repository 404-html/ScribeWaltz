00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.030
Gear for La.
It is a bummer.
How about Holly a?

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.210
I'm sure we'll Holly Cyborg.
It's happening.

3
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.600
It's interesting.
I'll tell you what.
Nobody has more composed or composure.

4
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.130
Nobody has more composure in their Instagram videos.
Then Holly,

5
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.730
she's the most composure.
She's like,
when she says professional,

6
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.040
Cyborg's been saying that.
I haven't been tested.
She's a politician.
I'd actually,

7
00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:32.400
I've been tested nine times.
She's been tested eight times,

8
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.640
so some of us are out here training not worrying about these.

9
00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:42.210
Fantastic.
It's so like,
thank you.
Thank you and have a good thank you.

10
00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:43.320
We're ready to head kick a pitch.

11
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.810
I love Paul even says in direct contrast to her fucking back flips.

12
00:00:48.811 --> 00:00:52.580
She's a politician,
had gigs and shit.
It's like a politician.
Very smart man.

13
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.190
Very calm and smooth and she's like a real all American girl.

14
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.220
Like you look at Holly Holm.
I mean she got freckles and shit.
She's pretty,

15
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.080
she looks like an all American head kicker and Pete Cyborg in for the tough.

16
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.550
If it's tough,
if she beats Cyborg to me,
she's number one of all time.

17
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.600
She'd beat Ronda and her prime right now.
She'd beat Cyborg in her prime.

18
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.070
What are we doing?
I know she had those rough logs show where you should take.

19
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.570
I know.
Listen,

20
00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:23.100
Misha Tate strangled her and she was still punching in the air while she was

21
00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:27.110
going unconscious.
Yeah.
That's how savage Holly Holm is.
I know.

22
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.120
It's such a great matchup.
You should take,
did get her and me.

23
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:33.090
She got her in the fifth round of a fight.
She was losing,
losing.

24
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.110
Took her back and put it asleep.
I'm going to miss your tape fans.
Ooh.

25
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.890
Yeah.
Fan.
But she's retired.
Yup.
She didn't wanna do anything about Holly Cyborg,

26
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.560
you know,
but it's that Holly Cyborg.
Yeah.

27
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.120
I wonder what kind of numbers that does cause that.

28
00:01:50.121 --> 00:01:54.030
That's your headline on there right now because you know,
dump cruises off.
Well,

29
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:59.031
it's going to show you the power of a like top flight women's MMA fights and

30
00:01:59.401 --> 00:02:03.120
then there's the,
you know,
there's the cyborg aspect.
Like people tune in,

31
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.310
she's like a cultural icon sort of a thing.
Like people will tune in to see you.

32
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.230
Like,
oh,
that cyborg check.
She's scared.
Yeah.

33
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.400
Does it scares either and scary being me.
Not physically scary.

34
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.780
Scary the way she destroys violent,
very violent,
violent and very technical.

35
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.310
Her last fight wasn't that violent,

36
00:02:17.311 --> 00:02:20.460
but she wanted to show most of his fighting a crazy,

37
00:02:20.461 --> 00:02:23.730
I mean zombies talking about something.
I'm Tonya evenger.
She's she.

38
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.780
She didn't give a fuck.
She was throwing a mom.
I don't know.
I call her mom,

39
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.310
but she's tough as fuck.

40
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.110
Had Mom bod and also would not go away like that if you were watching like a

41
00:02:34.111 --> 00:02:36.840
youtube or a lot,
it wouldn't even be on youtube.
They pull it from youtube,

42
00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:39.990
like a live leak outside of a bar and Kentucky I think worse.

43
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.250
She some chick gets up,
puts her fucking cigarette down and rolls up the sleeve.

44
00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.130
Flannel shirt,
probably wearing your shirt,

45
00:02:47.131 --> 00:02:50.850
the very shirt you're wearing and just throws haymakers on some check and she's

46
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:54.900
got her since she's fucking drop and Moitai elbows on her,

47
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.870
but she keeps getting mom.

48
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.170
She'd be like the Kimbo slice soccer moms in the backyard.
Brawls.
She's a tough,

49
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.600
tough woman.
She's as tough as you say,
an animal.

50
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:07.440
I enjoyed that fight because of her.
I agree.
She made the fire.

51
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.390
She made the fire chief.

52
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.820
She fucking had some whistling shots swinging by Cyborgs Chin.

53
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.870
She didn't plan for it.
Look it.
She took it.
She took it hard.

54
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.510
She was going for it.
That's off.
Took a fight that a lot of people didn't want.

55
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.600
No one wants that fight.
Yeah.
I mean look at fucking and Germane to random.

56
00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:24.280
He said,
Nah,
I'm good.

57
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.980
You can keep your title shot fighting her if she's done serious before it.
Yeah,

58
00:03:27.981 --> 00:03:32.230
but she tests clean now.
I don't care.
I'm out.
Not,
not recently enough.
Nope.
No.

59
00:03:32.231 --> 00:03:35.500
You got to get her.
Test her again like 10 years.
Yeah,
true.

60
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.580
Every day for 10 years.
Then we'll draw me said,
fuck is this.

61
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.010
I love that Cyborg fight though.
I do too,
but I wanted to see what number is.

62
00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:44.680
It does see Germane to random.
He is a very tactical Stryker.

63
00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:48.100
That's why I thought her versus Cyborg would be interesting.
I mean Jermaine,

64
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.390
Jermaine to random.
He fought a man.
That's how crazy scary Cyborg is.

65
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.441
Germane,

66
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:58.441
fought a man and k owed him this video of you if watch it.

67
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.970
She's like,
I'll fight a man,
but I don't know.

68
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.440
I just,

69
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.760
I'm often drawn to me trains when you give up the belt we say not fuck it.

70
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:13.750
She just,
she's too much.
Well I'm,
I'm a,
I'm a fan of her talent.

71
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.510
She's a very talented fighter but she should have been chipping in the first

72
00:04:16.511 --> 00:04:17.780
place.
I agree.
Paul.

73
00:04:17.781 --> 00:04:20.650
He beat her and I think she should have been penalized for sure.

74
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.740
For at least one of those.
After the bell shot 100%.

75
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.800
She landed two after the bell shots.
One of them was devastating.

76
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.600
Like she really rocked Holly,
beat her.
I think Holly beat her.
I think uh,

77
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.860
you got to take into consideration how,

78
00:04:32.861 --> 00:04:34.840
what scoring system they were using back then.

79
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.910
Cause I do not think that they were using the new MMA school.

80
00:04:37.911 --> 00:04:42.490
It's also New York Early Day New York.
When I say early day,
like six months ago.

81
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.500
I think the refereeing,

82
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.350
I mean I think the refereeing could have been better because I do think she

83
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:49.360
should have been penalized for those shots after the bill.

84
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.250
And when Holly head kicked her,

85
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.530
that was one of the most significant moments in the fight.

86
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.380
The other most significant moment of fighters and Holly dropped with a straight

87
00:04:56.381 --> 00:04:58.990
left hand.
Yeah.
So those are two giant moments in the fight.

88
00:04:58.991 --> 00:05:00.550
And they were both on Holly side.

89
00:05:00.551 --> 00:05:02.740
And then there was the two shots after the bell,

90
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.510
which you could conceivably penalize her for at least one you have to do for
one.

91
00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:09.470
And that's what I thought.
Holding on the fight.
Yeah,
I would,

92
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.740
I would agree with you.
I would agree with you because other than that,

93
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.080
Holly did the most damage in the fight for sure.
But during demanding Germain,

94
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.550
de Randamie was controlling the action,

95
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.920
the beginning of the fight until Holly landed that question mark kick.

96
00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:24.460
I'm Funko maybe a question mark.
It cause a beautiful Kik.
