1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.820
It's about you,
then you can have the film about something else.
Yes.

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.900
Cause it's not really about that.
Well did you like a event horizon?
Yeah,

3
00:00:06.901 --> 00:00:10.020
I did actually.
I thought that was fine.
Yeah.
Ridiculous.

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.800
I don't see any blood funds.
I always wanted to ask about their,

5
00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:18.801
their concept of propulsion that you almost like space would be flat and you

6
00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:23.070
would fold space over and you would intersect those two points and you'd be able

7
00:00:23.071 --> 00:00:26.130
to travel vast distances instantaneously.
Right.

8
00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:28.080
And I'm doing a terrible job of explaining it,
I'm sure.

9
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.250
But is that a concept that people have actually considered?
Yeah,

10
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.930
you can in general relativity.
So,
so Einstein,
I should say what it is,

11
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.890
Einstein's theory of general relativity is our best theory of space and time.

12
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.800
And so it really is,
as we talked about before,

13
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:47.460
is you imagine space and time as a sheet.

14
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.140
Just imagine it as a thing,
sort of,
uh,
literally sheet surface.

15
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.880
And all the theory says is that if you put matter and energy into that,

16
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.050
then it curves it and distorts it and it can stretch it and make it shrink.

17
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.630
And so it's the response of space and time to matter in energy.
So if you,

18
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.110
if you,
the simplest version will be the,
the sun.
So you put the,

19
00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:15.111
a big spherical ball of stuff in there and it warp space and time search to the,

20
00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:18.390
the nice straight lines,
something just traveling,

21
00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:22.140
minding its own business through that warp space turns into an orbit.

22
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.590
And that's why you can ask that kind of see things that are behind the sun.
Yeah.

23
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.420
Okay.
So light bends around the sun,
um,

24
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.200
because it's just traveling through the curved space.

25
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.160
The earth goes around the sun because it's just rolling minding its own business

26
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.470
through the curve space.
So,
um,
an example would be,
you might say,
well,

27
00:01:40.471 --> 00:01:44.130
how does it curved space perhaps cannot give rise to something that it's like a

28
00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:45.630
force,
which is gravity.

29
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.380
So the best analogy I know of is to think of walking around on the surface of

30
00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:52.230
the earth to be stand on the equator of the earth.

31
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.950
And you with your friend and you say,
we're going to walk due north.

32
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.390
So we're going to set off,

33
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.800
let's say we're a thousand miles apart on the equator and we're going to walk

34
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.170
due north and what's going to happen?
So you walk in straight lines,

35
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.990
you don't change direction,
you don't do any accelerating.

36
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.830
But the straight lines and lines of longitude on the surface of the earth.

37
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.050
So as you go further and further north,

38
00:02:13.051 --> 00:02:15.960
you get closer and closer together and he'd be carry onto the pole.

39
00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:20.210
You bump into each other,
but nothing's happened.
And no one's no one.

40
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.450
There's no forces acting.

41
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.260
It's just that you're moving on a curved surface and so you get closer.

42
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.730
And that's basically Einstein's theory of general relativity.
Now,

43
00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:34.500
why did I start talking about the vent horizon?
The idea of,
Oh yeah,
so,

44
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.440
so you can,
so all you have to do,

45
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.160
so those folded kind of geometries is you have to try and specify how,

46
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.990
where you would put the matter and what kind of stuff you'd put there to make

47
00:02:45.991 --> 00:02:50.850
the geometry fold in that way.
And you can do it.
You can do it.
So you can,

48
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.360
you can write down that geometry is called a warp drive.

49
00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:57.210
Geometry I think is the,
is in text books.

50
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.490
So you can do that to,
to have a warp drive.

51
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.530
The question becomes what sorts of stuff would you have to actually put into the

52
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:10.480
real universe to make it walk in that way.
And um,
it always,

53
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:13.510
it usually turns out that it's the kind of stuff that doesn't exist,

54
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.580
but it has properties.

55
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:20.200
Is Matt sort of matter or sort of energy that has properties that do not exist

56
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:21.730
in nature as far as we can tell.

57
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.570
But you can still write the geometry down in Einstein's theory.

58
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.080
So if you hadn't had never got force or mass or whatever it is,

59
00:03:29.081 --> 00:03:33.280
if you had that stuff that doesn't exist,
it is a concept that,
yeah,

60
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.980
so the geometry exists.
So you can,
you can,

61
00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:39.340
you can do it and you can do the calculations and you can see the warp drive.

62
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.050
You can construct worm holes that connect distant regions of the universe,

63
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:48.520
which you could use as time machines.
And you can do all that in the theory.

64
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.880
But in nature,
you'd have to have the right stuff to do it.

65
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.380
But that stuff is not real.
That seems to be as far as we know now,

66
00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:57.490
what would have to happen,

67
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.060
like you would have to have enough power or mass to,

68
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.660
to be able to fold those two things together.
It tends to be weird stuff like,
um,

69
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.540
stuff that has a negative pressure or something like that.

70
00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:15.541
So stuff that has physical properties that are just bizarre and that no matter

71
00:04:16.511 --> 00:04:20.950
or energy that we know of in the universe has so that to make,

72
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.690
to make the geometry happen.

73
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.870
But it's conceivable in theory that this could exist even though it doesn't,

74
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.340
it's a,
it's a,
it's a debate ultimately.
Um,

75
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.180
so wormholes that a good example.

76
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.600
So that would be quite literally it was talked about the surface of the earth.

77
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.730
So you fly to Australia from La and you have to go quite a long way around the

78
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.280
edge of the earth.
Oh,
you could tunnel straight through and get there quicker.

79
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.190
Right.
So that's a word.

80
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.590
Jamie's got a little graphic up there and there it is.

81
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.820
So you could go all the way around the edge or you could take the shortcut.

82
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.240
So the question is,
so you can do that in Einstein's theory,

83
00:04:58.241 --> 00:05:00.700
you can write down that geometry and,
and there it is.

84
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.330
So the first question is can you make it,
and as we've said,

85
00:05:04.331 --> 00:05:06.160
we don't think that stuff exists.

86
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.200
There's a second set of theoretical bits of theoretical work,
which are,

87
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.910
if you had a worm hole,
then what would happen if you tried to travel through it?

88
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.680
And what seems to happen is that is that they become unstable the moment

89
00:05:22.361 --> 00:05:23.800
anything tries to go through.

90
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.520
So you get kind of a feedback if stuff going through and through and through and

91
00:05:27.521 --> 00:05:30.460
through and so it collapses.
And that there's a great,

92
00:05:30.461 --> 00:05:32.740
there's a great book by Kip Thorne actually,
we just mentioned him.

93
00:05:32.741 --> 00:05:36.610
He got the Nobel Prize last year if the gravitational waves and he wrote a

94
00:05:36.611 --> 00:05:40.000
brilliant book,
I think it's in the 80s called black holes and time warps.

95
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.530
Ray Talks about the,
the answer is we don't fully know,

96
00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.270
but most physicists thing that even if they existed,
they will be unstable.

97
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.360
And as soon as you even tried to transmit information through them,

98
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:53.650
send a bit of light through,

99
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.380
then there will be this sort of feedback and they'd collapse.

100
00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.280
And ultimately the reason we don't really know absolutely is because you need

101
00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:04.130
what's called a quantum theory of gravity.
And we don't have one.

102
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.550
So we don't have the theoretical tools to be absolutely sure that these things

103
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.800
would be unstable or don't exist in nature.

104
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.390
But we strongly suspect that they don't.
They did.
You could build a time machine.

105
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.640
So there Stephen Hawking wrote a paper called the chronology protection,

106
00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:27.030
conjecture and conjectures.
Important word.
So he,

107
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.380
the conjecture basically was that the laws of nature will be such that you can't

108
00:06:32.451 --> 00:06:34.970
have stable wormholes and you can't build time machines.

109
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.160
And if you send something through it,
it would destabilize it.
Yeah.

110
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.370
And if it didn't disturb,
was it,

111
00:06:40.371 --> 00:06:45.200
how would your physical body deal with the stress of that?
Well,

112
00:06:45.201 --> 00:06:47.900
it doesn't have to be that you can,
you can build them.

113
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.200
That's called the tidal gravitational force.

114
00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:54.430
So it's the difference in gravitational pull across your body because you want

115
00:06:54.431 --> 00:06:56.330
the things that gets you if you fall into a black hole.

116
00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.380
So before you actually get to this singularity,
you can get,

117
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.740
it's called Spaghetti fried as a technical work.
So you get the,

118
00:07:03.741 --> 00:07:06.770
and it just like the moons,
you know the tidal effects on the earth,

119
00:07:06.771 --> 00:07:10.700
which is quite small,
but they still raised hides on the oceans.

120
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.270
So that can be a,
if you think about something like a black hole,

121
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.710
that can be any massive difference in gravitational pull from your head to your

122
00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:23.530
feet.
And so it can stretch you out.
And so,
but you can,
with wormholes you,

123
00:07:23.531 --> 00:07:24.170
you can,

124
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:28.070
you can write the geometry down in Einstein's theory such that you could go

125
00:07:28.071 --> 00:07:28.904
through,
so,

126
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.170
so you don't have to be destroyed or anything weird happened to you.

127
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.400
Would you have to have some something protecting you?
Some force,
some,

128
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.840
some sort of a,
you just literally he fall through.
I mean,
it's so,
so you know,

129
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:45.920
if they were,
if they exist,
you just,
you just go through,

130
00:07:45.921 --> 00:07:49.730
you sit in a little spaceship,
but you've,
you,
you wouldn't,

131
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:54.850
there's nothing inherently in them that says that you would be ripped apart or

132
00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:55.670
anything like that.
