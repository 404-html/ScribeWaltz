1
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.980
Her low freak bitches faces were born for sure.

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.840
They can take more impact,
wider faces,
bigger heads,
thicker.
Next for sure.

3
00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:12.570
They get absorbed better.
Everybody can get knocked out,
right?

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.280
Because the human bodies is so flawed,

5
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:18.420
especially if you have like some crazy ouster Overeem type character kick you in

6
00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:19.830
the head.
Anyone can get knocked out,

7
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.090
but it's less likely to get knocked out if you're shaped a certain way and your

8
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:27.450
hands,
the shape of your hands makes a giant difference as well.

9
00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:29.250
It's like how much impact you can deliver.

10
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.560
Like if you have some other times with us,

11
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.800
a George Foreman had an enormous hands,

12
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.820
like there's a guy named Francis and gone.

13
00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:38.420
It was like one of the top UFC heavyweights.
Every time I shake his hands,

14
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.430
I just go,
Jesus,

15
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.160
he's got these fucking hammers,

16
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.360
like these giant hammers and he just knocks people dead.
He,

17
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.000
it's a huge advantage.
Structural advantage.

18
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.190
It's like the difference between having a ball peen hammer,

19
00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:55.920
a little tiny hammer for nails and having a sledgehammer.

20
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.500
It literally is the difference.
You know?

21
00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:01.200
It's just having that extra weight on the end as a,

22
00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:04.770
especially if there's a lot of,
uh,
you know,
a lot of body mass behind it as well.

23
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.010
Just a massive there to be no gloves.

24
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.120
He'll look at his hands the size of his mother's.
Yeah.
They're enormous.

25
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.280
They're enormous.
Yeah.
Ah,
that's Brian stand by the way.

26
00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:22.230
Who was the UFC or the WC 205 pound champion.
Okay.
He,
uh,

27
00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:26.160
was a UFC fighter atop top UFC fighter at 185 pounds.
He's a big boy.

28
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.480
He and his arms get dwarfed by in Ganos hands.

29
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.330
Looks like a stump.
Yeah.
So that,

30
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.450
that is an undeniable physical advantage if you can land that punch

31
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.380
more dumbed head.
Yeah.
There's a lot of shit going on.

32
00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:43.530
But my point is that if fights had no pads,

33
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.640
we would get a more accurate representation of what the body can really do.

34
00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:48.420
Instead,

35
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.200
we're making fighters get more damaged because you're letting people tee off.

36
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.970
I don't think you should be able to tape your risks either.

37
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.180
I think that's unfair too because you can't gives it to make it stiffer so it

38
00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:02.130
doesn't buckle as much when you impact something cause we hit something.

39
00:02:02.131 --> 00:02:05.130
If your hand goes like that you can really fuck your wrist up and then you

40
00:02:05.131 --> 00:02:06.810
really get torn tendons,

41
00:02:06.811 --> 00:02:11.470
all kinds of shit like cement and their gloves and stuff.
They have.
Yeah.
Yeah.

42
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.830
Margarito did that.
Yeah.
He um,
he was fighting um,

43
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.070
a bunch of different guys and busting them up really bad.

44
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.770
And then before his fight with sugar,
Shane Mosley,

45
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:27.771
they caught him in the locker room with plaster in the wraps of the gloves.

46
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.290
Somebody caught him and then they started putting two and two together and

47
00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:34.230
realizing like when he beat up Miguel Cotto when he beat up all these different

48
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:36.540
fighters,
it was an unusual beating.

49
00:02:36.541 --> 00:02:38.680
Like he was hitting them and it was just having an un,

50
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.070
an ordinate inordinate effect on them,

51
00:02:41.071 --> 00:02:43.320
like hitting people way harder than anybody else was.

52
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.820
No one could figure out why.
Once they took that panning out

53
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.140
the way worse because Lance Armstrong was doing that when everybody else was

54
00:02:52.141 --> 00:02:53.190
also doing that.

55
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.380
No one else was putting too much and people are gonna start getting suspension.

56
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.700
Well,
they weren't,
he wasn't necessarily beating everybody,

57
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:02.920
but he was beating a lot of guys and the way he was beating him,

58
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:05.080
he was fucking them up.
And then when he got to sugar Shane,

59
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.800
they caught him with the plaster.
They took it out.
Rewrapped his hands and sugar.

60
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.100
Shane beat the fuck out of him and sugar.
Shane knew about it.

61
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:14.290
Everybody knew about it.
They were talking about it on the,
uh,

62
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:17.440
on the broadcast and that they were almost not letting him fight and they let

63
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:20.080
him fight with new Emily wrapped hands and sugar.

64
00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:22.990
Shane just lit him up like a Christmas tree.
Fucked him up.

65
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.800
And then Manny Pacquiao fucked him up to everybody fucked him up.

66
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.710
Why do you get to,
I mean,
I guess he should've been,

67
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.770
he should've been probably retired from boxing.

68
00:03:32.771 --> 00:03:34.700
They should have said there's no way you could ever fight again.

69
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.420
Just like we want to see you get killed a couple of times.
Yeah.

70
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:40.450
I mean he was never the same guy and he actually wound up fighting.

71
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.620
He had a really badly torn retina to the point where I think they put an

72
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:48.340
artificial retina from one of the beatings that he took I think to sugar Shane.

73
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.390
It might've been a pack.
Yeah,
it might've been the packout beat him,
beat him bad.

74
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.670
It was a couple of guys beat the fuck out of him,

75
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.030
but it's just that guy was putting plaster and his gloves so I'd have something.

76
00:03:59.031 --> 00:04:02.020
Gloves are the way to go.
I mean if you want to do it for boxing,
I get it.

77
00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:05.500
Boxing is a completely different sport and there's an art to catching punches on

78
00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:06.334
the gloves and,

79
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.170
but my thing about MMA in particular is why is it okay to elbow someone in the

80
00:04:11.171 --> 00:04:16.171
face but it's not okay to have gloves that are like bare knuckle.

81
00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:20.560
That's crazy.
You could literally smash someone's fencing this and this.
Yeah,

82
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:24.940
you could smash someone's head when an elbow like right in their eye socket and

83
00:04:24.941 --> 00:04:28.270
that's totally legal.
You could smash their nose to a pulp that's totally legal,

84
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.880
but some are like a shin.

85
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.940
You get hit someone so hard with your Shin.

86
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.500
It's a razor blade ultimately will it's a baseball bat kick someone in the head

87
00:04:38.501 --> 00:04:40.810
with a shin.
It's crazy.
There's no padding out of it at all,

88
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.700
but you have to have patty and your fists.
That's crazy.
Is that it's old.
We left.

89
00:04:45.701 --> 00:04:48.700
It's when the UFC first came about,

90
00:04:48.701 --> 00:04:53.170
it was beer and alcohol and then in in some sort of a,

91
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.520
you know sort of concerted effort to turn into a legitimize sport and be

92
00:04:57.521 --> 00:04:59.560
accepted by athletic commissions.
Pretty new,

93
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.440
very new in terms of like big time sports.

94
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.210
It was started in 1993 so just 20 something years old,
24 years old.

95
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.990
So they want it to make it look like in the beginning of the first fights that I

96
00:05:10.991 --> 00:05:14.600
saw in 97 when I first started working for the UFC,
there was a lot of bail,

97
00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.790
bare knuckle fighters.
Guys a fault with shoes on.
They were bare knuckle.

98
00:05:18.791 --> 00:05:21.670
You were allowed to grab people's crotches still you would rather grab their

99
00:05:21.671 --> 00:05:25.860
clothes are Kelly?
Yeah.
Not that a little different.
You were,

100
00:05:25.861 --> 00:05:26.950
you were allowed to do a lot of shit.

101
00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:29.560
You could pull hair for a long time in this area.

102
00:05:29.561 --> 00:05:34.090
And then they finally got rid of that.
They got rid of grabbing clothes.
But um,

103
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.720
you didn't have to have knuckle a padding on your knuckles back then.

104
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:41.680
And the people that were super successful realize you can hit people way harder

105
00:05:41.681 --> 00:05:42.820
if you have patty on your knuckles.

106
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.900
So Vito Belfort was one of the first night he was 19 years old and you enter

107
00:05:46.901 --> 00:05:49.060
into the UFC,
UFC 12 Dothan,

108
00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:53.320
Alabama in 1997 and just beat the fuck out of everybody with gloves on.

109
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.560
What would it take for them to do a role that said no gloves anymore?

110
00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.420
They would just have to listen to me.
Yeah.

111
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.640
And listen to a lot of other martial arts fans.

112
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.220
Some people wouldn't want it because they think he would get cut more,

113
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.670
which I think you would,
you would get more superficial tissue damage.

114
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.190
But I think ultimately you'd get less brain damage,
I think,
uh,

115
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.460
because you can get hit.
I think you'd get hit less.

116
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.120
And especially if you practice correctly,
I think you could,

117
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.200
I mean you would still run the risk of getting elbowed indeed and kicked and

118
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:23.420
it's not safe by any stretch of the imagination.

119
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.890
Do you think it has to get to a point where because MMA so young,

120
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.370
we're fighters or 60 and they're blowing their brains out and doing what that

121
00:06:31.371 --> 00:06:32.780
have helped players are doing.
Anybody would,

122
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.430
I don't think people would have to know.

123
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.790
I don't hear about a concussion crisis and then I made that much,
but it's real.

124
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.340
I mean any sort of combat sport you're going to have it.
No,

125
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:41.330
I mean I know it's there,

126
00:06:41.331 --> 00:06:44.270
but it's not like in the zeitgeists really at the moment it isn't yet,

127
00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:47.540
but it certainly could be and it probably certainly will be when some of the

128
00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:50.660
veterans getting into their sixties and seventies and we start to see them like,

129
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.730
do you ever see Joe Frazier before he died?
He was on the back of my throat.

130
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.750
He was on opiate Anthony Show and he,
it was so bad.

131
00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:03.110
His is slurring and this inability the payment was on Howard.

132
00:07:03.111 --> 00:07:07.020
It was like Floyd Mayweather.
I don't think he's showing any signs.
Yeah,

133
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.620
that's just how he talks.

134
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:13.870
Maybe it's just 5:00 AM 5:00 AM nervous talking Howard street trying to get it

135
00:07:13.971 --> 00:07:14.804
together

136
00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:20.930
or talking to Howard and you know probably has zero calm left in his box.

137
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:26.150
I was banging all night long.
Right.
For sure.
Too much common his mouth.

138
00:07:26.151 --> 00:07:28.770
What does this,
they have a CT tests.

139
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.870
They think a Boston University they found a biomarker they think that can let

140
00:07:32.871 --> 00:07:34.560
people know now ahead of time,

141
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:39.050
time before your Bell Rung three times and they sort of know that already know

142
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:41.060
cause it's not,
it varies upon the person.

143
00:07:41.061 --> 00:07:45.020
Some people are way more durable for some reason they don't know why and it

144
00:07:45.021 --> 00:07:47.030
could be also connected what we're talking about before,

145
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.750
the actual shape of the head,
the thickness of the muscles of the neck,

146
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.350
the ability to keep the head from snapping back too much.

147
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.750
How many times it actually happens,
how good you are avoiding things and roll.

148
00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:02.150
Some people get hit and then they learn how to roll with stuff and it takes a

149
00:08:02.151 --> 00:08:03.680
tremendous amount of the impact.
Off.

150
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.650
So you think would MMA fighters are in their sixties and seventies and it's like

151
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.320
not looking good?
They might consider,

152
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.620
I don't think they're going to consider it because I think to the general public

153
00:08:12.621 --> 00:08:17.621
gloves mean safer gloves means sport fans of Evan may want safe.

154
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:21.370
They um,
it,
it,
it,
well you got,

155
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.290
I would say if you're talking about public opinion,

156
00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:28.310
you're going to have a lot of the people that aren't really fans that are also

157
00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:30.590
going to weigh in.
Right?
So if you have public opinion,

158
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:31.910
should they take the gloves off?

159
00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:35.840
MMA is going to be a lot of people out there arguing passionately that have no

160
00:08:35.841 --> 00:08:39.110
idea what they're talking about loves me and more dangerous and they will say,

161
00:08:39.111 --> 00:08:43.010
no way.
It's already barbaric enough.
It's really what we should concentrate on.

162
00:08:43.011 --> 00:08:46.430
Just putting more pads and more safety procedures and stopping fights quicker

163
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:48.350
and looking out for the safety of these athletes.

164
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:53.770
But I think much like how pads and football probably caused more injuries to

165
00:08:54.651 --> 00:08:59.070
players.
Helmets,
rugby.
Yeah.
I think the same thing should be said about MMA.

166
00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:03.150
I think anathema to your logic of like helmets and pads cause injuries.
Yeah,

167
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.100
it really does because think they prevent them.

168
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.530
That's the only thing that it does any different.

169
00:09:07.531 --> 00:09:11.040
It doesn't like if I had to choose between finding someone with him and made

170
00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:11.611
gloves,
a fighting,

171
00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:14.900
someone bare knuckle and with like I get hand wraps and then I'll be like,
yeah,

172
00:09:14.901 --> 00:09:18.180
wrapped me up.
Yeah,
wrap me up.
You could just tee off on somebody.

173
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.270
It's a totally different experience.
If your hands are fragile,

174
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:24.570
a lot of times guys will hit each other with the palms of the hands instead

175
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.090
because you don't want to break your hands.
Get on top of someone.

176
00:09:27.091 --> 00:09:28.800
You could smash their face with a palm of this.

177
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:32.010
The hardest part of your hand hit things hard with a palm and it doesn't hurt at

178
00:09:32.011 --> 00:09:34.970
all.
Right?
Yeah.
It's a different kind of a bone to come.

179
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:38.610
Thick bone and it's used to touching and pushing against the hardest part of

180
00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:42.570
your body,
your elbows,
maybe your knee and your elbow.
Yeah,
they're real hard.

181
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.280
I mean,
you can't really break your elbow,

182
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.500
I guess you've probably seen people break shit all the time.

183
00:09:46.501 --> 00:09:50.820
They break chunks off the bottoms of their elbows from fighting.
Yeah.

184
00:09:50.821 --> 00:09:53.880
I've had friends that have to get surgery where they have like floating bone

185
00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:57.270
chunks from elbow and people in the head that you chip off little pieces of your

186
00:09:57.271 --> 00:09:58.250
elbow.
That's not great.

187
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:08.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>
