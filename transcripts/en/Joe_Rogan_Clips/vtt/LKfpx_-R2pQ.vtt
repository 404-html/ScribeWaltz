14
00:01:08.861 --> 00:01:13.861
Some days I'll wake up in a sweat bodies wet from the teaching baby

15
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.430
with all these cheap thrills from tangible achievements weighing heavy on my

16
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:38.773
Amy,

17
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.660
it's like a path.
I'll walk,

18
00:01:55.661 --> 00:02:00.661
lift me up like daytime talk like a Reno Rock and sing it to you

19
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.530
straight from the heart.

20
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.930
Fi Fi

21
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.800
there'd be a violin solo,
but we don't have the violin.
Right.

22
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.880
We'll skip that.
I say it till,

23
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.800
I don't mean
don't want to come from my,

24
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.190
don't want to lose myself in some days,

25
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.310

You guys have such a good sound.
Again,

32
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.630
it's two people that were working at it for a long time.
What time?

33
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.090
You got to know each other's sound?

34
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.290
Make difference.
How'd you mess it up?
Oh,
you know,
it's new stuff.

35
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.820
It's like it's going to shut up.

36
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.980
Set that map and open it up with singing.
Okay.

37
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.160
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
