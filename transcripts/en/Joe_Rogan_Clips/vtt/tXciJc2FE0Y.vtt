00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.960
Artificial general intelligence,
there's seems to be two camps of people,

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.680
ones who are really working deep in it.

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.870
Like that's the camp I kind of sit in.

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.700
And a lot of those folks tend to roll their eyes and just not engage in tiny

5
00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:15.870
discussions in the future.

6
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.230
They're idea is saying it's really hard to do what we're doing and it's just

7
00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:25.710
really hard to see how this becomes intelligent.

8
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.090
And then there's another group of people who say,
yeah,
but B,

9
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.130
you're being very shortsighted that you may not be able to do much now,

10
00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:39.990
but the exponential,
the hard takeoff overnight,

11
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.530
it can become super intelligent and then it'll be too late to think about.

12
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.780
Now the problem with those two camps,
as with any camps,
Democrat republic,

13
00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:51.630
any camps is they don't seem that'd be,

14
00:00:51.631 --> 00:00:56.040
seem to be talking past each other as opposed to both have really interesting

15
00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:56.550
ideas.

16
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.550
If you go back to the analogy of a touch of death,

17
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.630
a of this,
this idea of MMA,
right?
So I'm the,

18
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:10.560
in this analogy,
I'm going to put myself in the UFC for a second.
Uh,

19
00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:15.180
in this analogy,
I'm,
you know,
like ranked in the top 20.
I'm working really hard.

20
00:01:15.181 --> 00:01:18.570
My dream is to become a world champion.
I'm training three times a day.

21
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.540
I'm really working.
I'm an engineer.
I'm trying to build my skills up.

22
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.820
And then there's other folks that come along like Steven Seagal and so on that

23
00:01:26.821 --> 00:01:29.580
kind of talk about other kinds of martial arts,

24
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.190
other ideas of how you can do certain things.

25
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.980
And I think,

26
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.910
I think Steven Seagal and could not mine beyond to something.

27
00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:42.450
I think we really need to be open minded like a inch.
The civil,

28
00:01:42.451 --> 00:01:46.000
I think it talks in us or somebody talks as you know,
Ciga,
right?

29
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.060
<v 1>Anderson Silva thinks Steven Seagal is,</v>

30
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.060
I want to put this in a respectful way.

31
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.990
He Anderson Silva has a wonderful sense of humor and Anderson Silva is very

32
00:02:02.781 --> 00:02:07.781
playful and he thought it would be hilarious if people believe that he was

33
00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:11.810
learning all of his martial arts from Stacy's.
Got It.

34
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.900
He also loves Steven Seagal movies legitimately so treated him with a great deal

35
00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:18.134
of respect.

36
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.520
He also recognizes that Steven Seagal actually is a master of Ikea.

37
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.970
He really does understand the Kido and was one of the very first Westerners that

38
00:02:28.311 --> 00:02:32.600
was teaching in Japan,
speaks fluent Japanese,

39
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.400
was teaching at a Dojo in Japan and is,
you know,

40
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.300
a legitimate master of I kido.
Right.

41
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.700
The problem with that Quito is it's,

42
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.100
it's one of those martial arts that has merit in a,

43
00:02:49.101 --> 00:02:51.130
in a vacuum.
They get few.

44
00:02:51.131 --> 00:02:56.131
If you're in a world where there's no NCAA wrestlers or know judo players or no

45
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.950
Brazilian Jujitsu,
black belt or no,
um,
Moitai kickboxers,

46
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.470
there might be something to that Ikea stuff.

47
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.830
But in a world where all those other martial arts exist and we've examined all

48
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:15.760
the intricacies of hand to hand combat,
it falls horribly short.

49
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.680
Let's see.
This is the point I'm trying to make.

50
00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:22.570
You just said that we've investigated,
uh,
all the intricacies.

51
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.130
You said all the intricacies of hand to hand combat.
I mean,
you're just speaking,

52
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:32.131
but you want to open your mind to the possibility that I kito has,

53
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.430
uh,
some techniques that are affected are affected.
Yeah.

54
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.750
When I say all that's you're,
you're,
you're correct.

55
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.520
That's not a correct way of describing it,
right?

56
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.400
Because there's always new moves that are being like for instance,
um,

57
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.450
in this,
uh,
recent fight between Anthony Pettis and Tony Ferguson,

58
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.840
Tony Ferguson actually used wing Chung in a fight.
He,

59
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.800
he trapped one of Anthony Pettis his hands and hit him with an elbow.
He,

60
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.800
they basically used a technique that you would use on a wing Chung dummy.

61
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.930
And he did it in an actual and world class,
mixed martial arts fight.

62
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.700
And I remember watching it.
Wow,

63
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.730
go on this crazy motherfucker actually pulled that off.
Cause that's,

64
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.130
it's a technique that you just rarely see anybody getting that proficient at it.

65
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:18.460
That,

66
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:23.460
that fights in MMA and Ferguson is it extremely creative and open minded guy.

67
00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:28.480
And he figured out a way to make that work,
you know,
worldclass fight.
So,

68
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.320
and let me then ask you the question.
There's,

69
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.800
there's these people who still believe quite a lot of them that there is this

70
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:37.390
touch of death,
right?

71
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.930
So do you think it's possible to discover no through this rigorous scientific

72
00:04:43.931 --> 00:04:48.280
process that is MMA that started pretty recently?
Do you think,

73
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.270
not the touch of death,

74
00:04:49.271 --> 00:04:52.690
but do you think we can get a 10 x improvement in the amount of power the human

75
00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:56.720
body can,
can generate in and punching?
No,

76
00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.060
certainly not.
10 X.
I think you can get incremental improvements,

77
00:05:01.061 --> 00:05:03.370
but it's all based entirely on your frame.

78
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.480
Like if you're a person that has very small hands and narrow shoulders,

79
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.320
you're kind of screwed.
There's not really a lot of room for improvement.
You can,

80
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.820
you can certainly get incremental improvement and your ability to generate
power,

81
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.980
but you'll never be able to generate the same kind of power as say a guy with a

82
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:25.660
very big frame like a Brock Lesnar or Derrick Lewis or,

83
00:05:25.661 --> 00:05:28.090
um,
you know,
anyone who has,

84
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.390
there's like classic elements that go with,
uh,

85
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.240
being able to generate large amounts of power,
wide shoulders,

86
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.830
large hands.
There's a,

87
00:05:38.831 --> 00:05:43.350
there's a lot of characteristics of the human frame itself.
Um,

88
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.360
those,
even those people,

89
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.580
there's only so much power you can generate.

90
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:52.650
And we pretty much know how to do that correctly.
So the,

91
00:05:52.651 --> 00:05:56.320
the way you're talking about as a martial arts expert now,

92
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.160
it's kind of the way a lot of the experts

93
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.160
<v 0>in robotics and AI talk about AI and when the topic of touch of death has</v>

94
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:06.830
brought up,
now the analogy is not perfect.

95
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.890
I tend to use probably too many analogies is we maybe know the human body better

96
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.630
than we know the possibility of Ai.

97
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.620
<v 1>I assume so.
Right.
Cause the possibility of AI is basically limitless.</v>

98
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:21.770
Once AI starts re redesigning itself,

99
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.970
<v 0>it's not obvious that that's true.</v>

100
00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.770
Our imagination allows it to be true.
When I,
I'm of two minds,

101
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.740
I am,
I am,
I'm both,

102
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.440
I can hold both believes that are contradictory in my mind.

103
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.210
One is that idea is really far away,
almost bordering and bs.

104
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.140
And the other is it can be there overnight and I think you could believe both of

105
00:06:44.141 --> 00:06:48.520
those things.
So,
um,
hmm.
There's another,
uh,

106
00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.930
quote,
uh,
from Barbara Wooden,

107
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.090
that's a poem I heard on a,
on a,
on a,

108
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.750
on a lecture somewhere that I really like,
which is,

109
00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:03.310
it's from the champions of the impossible rather than the slaves of the
possible.

110
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.320
That evolution draws his creative force.

111
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:10.420
So I see all mosque as a representative of the champion of the impossible.

112
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:16.290
I see exponential growth of AI within the next several decades as the

113
00:07:16.541 --> 00:07:17.374
impossible,

114
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.740
but it's the champions of the impossible that actually make the impossible

115
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.810
happen.
Why would a

116
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.970
<v 1>exponential growth of AI be impossible?</v>

117
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.430
Because that seems inevitable to me.

118
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.650
<v 0>So it's not impossible,
Eh,</v>

119
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:35.030
I'm sort of using the word impossible in meaning magnificent.

120
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.420
The feels very difficult.
Very,
very difficult.

121
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.690
We don't even know where to begin.
Rand.
Yup.

122
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.700
Like the touch of death actually feels,

123
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.210
I would see the touch of death is horse shit,
but see,
you're an expert.

124
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.190
<v 1>Ah,
and they touch you in the chest,</v>

125
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.910
but we don't have the ability in the body to generate that kind of energy.

126
00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:57.620
How do you know that?
That's a good question.
Um,
it's never been done.

127
00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:02.600
We understand.
How do you know it's never been done?
Okay.

128
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:06.620
There could be someone out there with magic that I,
that has escaped my,
my grasp.

129
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.050
<v 0>No,
you've studied,
you've talked about with a Graham Hancock,</v>

130
00:08:10.051 --> 00:08:14.370
and he was talking about the history.
Maybe it was in Roman times.

131
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:19.400
There was that idea was discovered and then it was lost because weapons are much

132
00:08:19.831 --> 00:08:23.820
more effective ways of,
uh,
of delivering damage.

133
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.170
Now I find myself in a very uncomfortable position of defending the concept as a

134
00:08:28.171 --> 00:08:31.680
martial artist,
uh,
defining the concept of this sorts.

135
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:35.940
Did you study a Jujitsu and judo and wrestling,

136
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:40.690
<v 1>wrestling,
wrestling,
the hard ones?
Those are the Jitsu.
Judo and wrestling.</v>

137
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.710
Those are absolute martial arts in my opinion.
This is what I mean.

138
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:50.070
Like if you are a guy who just has a fantastic physique and incredible speed and

139
00:08:51.611 --> 00:08:56.100
ridiculous power,
just you just can generate ridiculous power if you just are,

140
00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:01.560
uh,
just a Pr,
you know,
who do you not Deontay wilder is,
yes.
Heavyweight champion.

141
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:06.060
The world boxer.
He's a fee.
You have,
what's his name?
Tyson fury fury.

142
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:08.940
On tomorrow it's going to feed it guys,
right?
Yes.
Oof.

143
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.320
Deontay wilder has fantastic power.

144
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.340
I mean,
he just knocks people flying across the ring.
He's just,

145
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.820
I think Deontay wilder,
if he just came off the street,

146
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:24.660
if he was 25 years old and no one ever taught him how to box it all,

147
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.710
and you just wrapped his hands up and had him hit a bag,

148
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.430
he would be able to generate insane amounts of force.
Now,

149
00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:36.330
if you are a person that really didn't have much power and you had a box with

150
00:09:36.331 --> 00:09:39.450
Deontay wilder,
and you were both of the same age,

151
00:09:39.451 --> 00:09:42.810
and you are a person that knew boxing and you stood in front of Deontae,

152
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.350
it's entirely possible that Deontay wilder could knock you into another

153
00:09:46.351 --> 00:09:49.800
dimension.
Even though he had no experience in boxing.

154
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.640
If he just held on you and hit you with a haymaker,

155
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:57.420
he might be able to put you out.
If you're a person who is,

156
00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:58.110
let's say,

157
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:03.110
built like you an a guy who exercises who strong and then there's someone who's

158
00:10:03.831 --> 00:10:08.831
I identically built like you who's a black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu and you

159
00:10:10.531 --> 00:10:15.420
don't have any experience in martial arts at all.
You're fucked,
right?
Yes.

160
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.880
You're a person who's built like you who's a,

161
00:10:18.881 --> 00:10:23.881
a guy who exercises and is healthy and you grapple the guy who is even stronger

162
00:10:24.451 --> 00:10:27.960
than you and bigger than you,
but he has no experience in Brazilian Jujitsu.

163
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:31.440
He's still fucked.
Yeah.
That's the difference.

164
00:10:31.441 --> 00:10:35.190
That's why I think Brazilian Jujitsu and judo and wrestling and particularly

165
00:10:35.191 --> 00:10:39.000
those are absolutes in that you have control of the body.
Yes.

166
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.370
And once you grab a hold of a person's body,

167
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.780
there's no lucky triangle chokes in Jujitsu.
That's right.

168
00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:47.783
Right.
But

169
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:49.130
<v 0>I think,
uh,</v>

170
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:54.620
I think I would say Jujitsu as the highest representative of that.

171
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.800
I think in wrestling and judo,
having practiced those,

172
00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:01.780
I've never been quite as humble.
Does that have been in Jujitsu Jitsu?

173
00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.240
Especially when I started,
I was like power lifting.
I was like,

174
00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.360
I was a total meathead and you know,

175
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:12.890
130 pound guy or girl could tap you easily.
Yeah.
It's confusing.

176
00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.050
It's very confusing in wrestling.

177
00:11:15.051 --> 00:11:18.390
You can get pretty far with that head power.
Yeah.

178
00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.550
And judo a little bit less.

179
00:11:22.551 --> 00:11:27.350
So at its highest levels at if you go to Japan for example,
where they,

180
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:32.570
I mean the whole dream of judo is effortlessly throw your opponent,

181
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:37.700
but in,
you know,
if you go to gyms in America and so on,

182
00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:39.351
you know,

183
00:11:39.351 --> 00:11:43.940
there is some hard wrestling style gripping and just beating each other up

184
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:48.290
pretty intensely where we're not talking about beautiful tomatoes are these

185
00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:52.070
beautiful throws.
We were talking about some scrapping some,
uh,

186
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.790
some wrestling style.
Yeah.

187
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.230
<v 1>Yeah,
no,
I see what you're saying.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

188
00:11:56.290 --> 00:12:01.120
my experience with Jujitsu was very humbling when I first started out.
I was,

189
00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:05.610
uh,
I had a long background in martial arts and striking and uh,

190
00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:06.970
even wrestled in high school.

191
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:12.010
And then I started taking Jujitsu and a guy who was my size and I was young at

192
00:12:12.011 --> 00:12:16.330
the time and he was basically close to my age,
just mauled me.

193
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.750
And he wasn't even a black belt.
I think he was a purple belt.

194
00:12:19.751 --> 00:12:22.390
He might've been a blue belt.
I think it was a purple belt.
Um,

195
00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:26.200
and he just destroyed me.
Just did anything he wanted to meet,
choked me,

196
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:29.680
arm barred me just,
and I remember thinking,
man,

197
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:33.650
I am so delusional.
I thought I had a chance.
Right.

198
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:38.750
I thought just based on taking a couple classes and learning what an Armbar is

199
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:43.570
and then being a strong person who has a background in martial arts that I would

200
00:12:43.571 --> 00:12:45.940
be able to at least hold him off a little bit.

201
00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:49.110
<v 0>No.
And this is,
uh,
uh,</v>

202
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:54.440
that's so beautiful that I feel lucky to have that had that experience of having

203
00:12:55.321 --> 00:12:58.890
my ass kicked.
And Philadelphia is where I came up with.
Because in science,

204
00:12:58.891 --> 00:13:02.940
you don't often get that experience in the space of ideas.
You can't,

205
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:07.920
uh,
you can't choke each other out.
You can't beat each other up in science.

206
00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:10.620
And so it's easy to go your whole life.

207
00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:14.270
I have so many people around me telling me how smart I am.
Uh,

208
00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.700
there's no,
uh,

209
00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:21.240
way to actually know if I'm smart or not cause I think I'm full of bs and in the

210
00:13:21.241 --> 00:13:25.950
same,
uh,
I in the same realm is as fighting.

211
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:29.820
There's no,
it's a will.
Hixon Gracie said it means the,

212
00:13:29.821 --> 00:13:33.630
or some of the Sala bearer or somebody that the math doesn't lie.

213
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:38.910
There's this deep honesty in it that was,
um,
really grateful.
Almost like wanting,

214
00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.550
you know,
you talk about bullies are you talk about,

215
00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:47.010
or even just my fellow academics could a benefit significantly from training a

216
00:13:47.011 --> 00:13:50.250
little bit.
I think so too.
It's uh,
yeah,
it's,

217
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:52.380
it's a beautiful thing to almost,

218
00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:56.100
I think has been talked about in high school sort of requiring it.
Yeah.

219
00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:57.833
Many times.
Yeah.

220
00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:02.250
I think it's a more humbling sport to be honest than wrestling cause you could,

221
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:06.510
in wrestling,
like I said,
get away with,
with some muscle.

222
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:11.140
<v 1>It's also what martial arts are supposed to be in that a small person who knows</v>

223
00:14:11.141 --> 00:14:14.200
technique can beat a big person who doesn't know the technique.
That's right.

224
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.840
That's what we always hoped for.
Right.

225
00:14:16.841 --> 00:14:19.940
When we saw the Bruce Lee movies and Bruce Lee who was a smaller guy,

226
00:14:19.941 --> 00:14:23.260
I can beat all these bigger guys just cause he had better technique that is

227
00:14:23.261 --> 00:14:24.850
actually real in Jujitsu.

228
00:14:24.851 --> 00:14:27.130
And it's one of the only martial arts where that's a real,

229
00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:31.460
<v 0>yeah.
And I,
uh,
I have an in Philadelphia has started,</v>

230
00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:34.880
you had Steve Maxwell here,
right?
Sure.
That's kind of where the,

231
00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:37.310
that was the spring of Jujitsu in Philadelphia.

232
00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:41.430
<v 1>He was one of the very first American black belts and Jujitsu like way back in</v>

233
00:14:41.431 --> 00:14:45.360
the day,
I believe he was a black belt in the very early nineties.
Yeah.
Um,

234
00:14:45.361 --> 00:14:50.361
when Jujitsu was really just starting to come to America and he had a Max

235
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.270
Marseilles exercise in Philadelphia.
It's still there.

236
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:56.620
And then I tried to balance,
which is,
uh,

237
00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:01.190
a few Gracie folks,
which she's filming Clarice,
Rick Burglaries,
Josh Vogel,

238
00:15:01.191 --> 00:15:04.430
Brothers.
So all those,
I mean,
especially Vogel brothers,

239
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.510
a couple black balls that come up together is there.

240
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:12.260
Well,
they're smaller,
the little guys.

241
00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.160
And I think those were the guys that really humbled me pretty quickly.
Well,

242
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:18.950
little guys are the best to learn technique from.
Yeah.

243
00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:23.750
Because they can't rely on strength.
There's a lot of really big,

244
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:26.090
powerful,
you know,
250 pounds,

245
00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:31.091
you Jitsu guys who never are going to develop the sort of subtlety of technique

246
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.450
that some like,
uh,

247
00:15:33.451 --> 00:15:37.640
what the May out brothers like smaller guys who just,

248
00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:39.530
they've from the very beginning,

249
00:15:39.531 --> 00:15:43.520
they've never had an advantage in weight and size and so they've never been able

250
00:15:43.521 --> 00:15:45.530
to use anything but perfect technique.

251
00:15:45.531 --> 00:15:47.930
Eddie Bravo is another great example of that too.
You know,
he,

252
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:51.830
he competed in the 140 pounds,
145 pound class.
