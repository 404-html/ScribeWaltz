1
00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.970
Metro Trump kept calling Jeb Bush low energy.

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.960
I was laying on the couch and that's fucking me.
He's talking about it.

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.170
I'm laying on the couch and I hear about somebody dying in an avalanche and I

4
00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:13.380
watch it on TV and I laughed because I wouldn't have a fucking be dropped off in

5
00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:16.770
a helicopter at the top of a mountain to go snowboarding and then they die.

6
00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:20.010
I'm laughing my balls off eating a bag of chips.
Well the one person,

7
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:23.460
he's never called anybody anything is Nancy Pelosi.
And people like,

8
00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:27.900
why hasn't he come up with a nickname for her yet?
Yeah.
You know,

9
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.230
cause you can't say content that's going to cost him the election.

10
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.550
That'll cost them 20,
27 said a joke about that.
He's like,

11
00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:38.770
it's countdown until Trump 12

12
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.120
sick ankle talk face.
That's what I call Hillary.
I don't even call her.
Uh,
what,

13
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.520
what kind of a nickname,
if you were going to help him,

14
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.890
like if he hired you like nick,
hello,

15
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.300
I need a solid republican comic to help me with my one liners.
What do you think?

16
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.130
Well,
I call her on my show.
I refer her to the,
uh,
uh,

17
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.950
the leathery nippled.
Hmm.
That's too,
too wordy.
We need some pretty good look.

18
00:01:02.951 --> 00:01:07.320
Can we change our day like a lion ted?
Okay.
Yeah.

19
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.420
Fucking naughty.
Nancy.
What did he call Hillary?
Crooked Hillary.
Crooked Hillary.

20
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.210
Lying Ted.
How Bout Energy Jeb?

21
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.620
About a yeast infection in heels.

22
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.180
How about lying liberal

23
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.590
fuck stick.
Do you know that she's worth $100 million?
Yes,
I do.

24
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.580
She figured out the little people joke.

25
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.420
She represents the working class.
You know,

26
00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:39.000
she has fucking walls around our matching.
Meanwhile,

27
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:43.440
people laying their own feces in San Francisco.
Well,
that Laura Loomer chick,

28
00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:45.330
that chick did a handcuff yourself to Twitter.

29
00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:48.510
She hopped Nancy's fence and he started setting up,
uh,

30
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.250
like a migrant camp.
Nancy's slot.
Did you see that?
What happened?

31
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.540
What was the result?
Illegal.
She's doing something illegal.
She's trespassing.

32
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.110
I would say donagey I'll be outside of how it's gone.
This fence is immoral,

33
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.340
right?
Build that wall or don't,
I always think the wall still,

34
00:02:05.341 --> 00:02:09.660
but when we have the machine guns and tanks and flame throwers,
like I cook them.

35
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.490
You don't have to kill.
I'm serious about this.
You're going to laugh because

36
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.710
you don't have to,
but seriously,

37
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.430
I love how we rule out lethal force as far as protecting our board.

38
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.310
That's not even on the plate,
so I,
okay.
It's too many.

39
00:02:26.311 --> 00:02:29.490
It was a pick somebody off as they're climbing event,
but okay.

40
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.880
You something less lethal.
A supersoaker filled with cat piss.
