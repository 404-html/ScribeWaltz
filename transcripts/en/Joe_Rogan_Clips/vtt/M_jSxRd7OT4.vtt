1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.360
He's,
uh,
he's definitely a legend man.
Elon Musk.

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.260
He's not as blow torch to like,
he's fucking are thing going nice.

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.290
He let that fucking thing up in the hallway out here.
No.
Yeah.

4
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.500
I thought he's going to burn the building down.
I haven't even lit mine.

5
00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:15.810
I'm so afraid of my son's like,
of course animal.

6
00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:19.080
I don't want him to know how to turn it on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He,

7
00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:22.380
he gave it to me and put the fucking fuel in it and everything.
I was like,

8
00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:26.130
all right,
thanks.
Crazy.
Like he comes bearing gifts.

9
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.280
How many people give you a blowgun blow torch?

10
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.560
Torch can blow.
It was called,
it's not a blow torch,
right?
No.

11
00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:38.240
What does he call it?
It's not a,
it's not a blow torch or,
yeah,
not a blow torch.

12
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.570
Is that,
what is it?
It's call that believes.
So,
yeah,
whenever it is,

13
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.570
this is a crazy picture online that we put up of him shooting that fucking thing

14
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.660
out in the hallway.
And you're like,
you can't tell them no.
You know,

15
00:00:52.661 --> 00:00:53.520
like no one tells him no,

16
00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:57.090
he's got security around them and all these fucking hold these mercenaries with

17
00:00:57.091 --> 00:01:01.980
guns.
No one's saying,
hey,
he rolls hard,
dude.
He's Elan Musk.

18
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.770
It's worth billions everywhere he goes.
I mean he's,

19
00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:06.120
he's got to have security everywhere.

20
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.200
Guys come before him and case everything out.
Yeah,
look at him.

21
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.160
What did I conic photo
with the Freak party sign above his head.

22
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:21.400
It's almost like we planned it and Steven Tyler that Steven Tyler's Mugshot in

23
00:01:21.401 --> 00:01:25.140
the background.
Crazy man.
He's such,

24
00:01:25.141 --> 00:01:28.330
it takes from your guys' interview too where he's just like fucking stone.

25
00:01:28.331 --> 00:01:31.650
To be honest,
I don't think he got stoned.

26
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.370
I don't think you've really inhaled.
He took like a t,
a tiny puff.

27
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.500
I think he puffed it like a cigar,
like really smokes weed.
Inhale.
He drinks.

28
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.380
We drank.
That's what was interesting about that.

29
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.570
The the blowback or the backlash is that we drank for two hours before we busted

30
00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:51.690
out the weed,
but the weed was like,
what are they doing?

31
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.720
Guide takes one hit of weed,
what are they doing?

32
00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.530
And then it went crazy and stock plummeted 6% and but it went back up to 9% the

33
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.240
next day.
Smoke before you drink.
Right.
I don't know.

34
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.610
I think you get really fucked up if you don't smoke a lot and you smoke after

35
00:02:08.611 --> 00:02:13.320
you've been drinking.
It's a wrap.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
I don't know.
He never seen it.

36
00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:16.560
I don't think it affected him.
He was like,
whoa.
But he's so,

37
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.670
his brain is wired so different.
You know what his brain is like.

38
00:02:20.671 --> 00:02:25.050
It's like you ever see like a,
okay,
no disrespect to Pete Holmes,

39
00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:26.400
but you know Pete Holmes,
the comedian,

40
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.220
like look at his body and then look at Usain bolt's.

41
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.120
That's how I feel like,
like the way if they had a race,

42
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.380
that's how I feel like with my brain in the room with Elan's brain,
it was like,

43
00:02:37.381 --> 00:02:42.110
well,
these are barely the same thing.
Their bales and keep up man.
Like you.

44
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.780
You've had some crazy guests that are talking about Adam's and fucking the

45
00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:49.380
universe and whatever else and you're always like you.

46
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.130
You keep up with everybody.
That's an illusion.
I don't know.
Just memorize things.

47
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.440
Yeah.
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
They know.

48
00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:57.570
They understand the actual concepts.
Yeah.
You know,

49
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.270
I might be able to repeat things that I've learned and read.
Yeah.

50
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.870
But I don't know what the fuck I'm really talking about.
They know what the fuck,

51
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.060
like,
you know what I'm saying?

52
00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:07.780
It's like if someone never did Jujitsu before and they want to talk about

53
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.210
choking someone out in a triangle,
and I hear them say it,
I'm like,
okay,
Yay.

54
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.660
That's how you do it.
That's how you do it.

55
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.210
But they don't really know how to do it.
You know what I'm saying?

56
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.550
But then if you're talked to hoists Gracie,

57
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.830
and he tells you how to choke someone out with a triangle like this mother

58
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:24.610
fucker did it.
He knows how to do it.
He does it all the time.

59
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.270
It's a different conversation,
you know?
So that's the difference.
Like me,

60
00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:30.910
I'm like a spectator talking to these geniuses,

61
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:33.730
but I just trying to pull information out of them.

62
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:36.190
I'm just trying to get them to talk.
You know?

63
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.850
I just try to know a little bit about what they're talking about.
