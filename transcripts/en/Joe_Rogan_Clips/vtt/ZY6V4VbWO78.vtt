1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.060
On the last 13 seconds.
Volkov yeah,
I think he has a sting ray.

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.480
I thought I was like,
Oh yeah.
It is kind of a sting.

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.680
I could see you going like what a great friend to stewards are.

4
00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:10.650
Some of the most underrated to creatures there are.
First of all,

5
00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:14.460
the preschoolers should haven't evolved in millions and millions of years.

6
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.760
We're strange thing to have tattoo on your back and wonder if he's like an ocean

7
00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:22.330
guy.
Really
did sit oh gee,
shit.
Ice.

8
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.670
We swam with those and,
and uh,
forget where.

9
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.630
Oh,
Flores off Flores.
I near where the Komodo dragons are.

10
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.870
You fucking dive in and restore.
He went to the isle of Flora's.
Oh,
that's,

11
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.910
that's where that little fucking man lived.
You know,
they had that,

12
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.050
that human being that they found,
what did they call it?
Um,

13
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.100
Homo Floresiensis,
I think they call it.
Yeah.
It was a little tiny hobbit,

14
00:00:47.101 --> 00:00:48.600
like person that existed,

15
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.790
I want to say as recently as 10 to 15,000 years ago,

16
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.860
there was like a three foot tall kind of human.
Yeah.

17
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.850
There was,
there's been many different branches of human being,
right?

18
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:05.630
There's been neander tall homosapien.

19
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.340
There's a one from Russia,
Diane Isis or something like that.

20
00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:13.350
I forget how to say like,
look at that.
Oh yeah,
no,
I met that guy.
He ran a hustle.

21
00:01:13.351 --> 00:01:17.910
I stood up.
Yeah,
that guy was the shit he gave me.
Good,
good drugs.
Um,

22
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.210
but this little little person that lived alongside human beings,

23
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.290
see if my timeline is right.
They have speech they don't know,

24
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.850
but they know they use tools.

25
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.490
I don't know am I was make sure to paint them with tool to show you what I need.

26
00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:38.520
Five thousand seventy thousand years ago.
Oh,
that's it.
17,000 years ago.
Wow.

27
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.210
Why does it say he bunked but what's that one?
Hobbit.
Human species debunked.

28
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.750
I don't think that's correct.
It says new historian,
but uh,

29
00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:50.340
I'm pretty sure that's probably an old article.
Audiences.
What year?

30
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.290
What was that article?
When is that?
10 years ago.
10 years ago?
Yeah.

31
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.390
Was it 10 years ago?
2004 Oh,
no,
no,
no.
The talking about it.
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.030
So it's 2014 is the article.
That's fairly recently.

33
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.980
I don't think that's the consensus.

34
00:02:04.981 --> 00:02:07.140
I don't think the consensus is that it's been debunked.

35
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.550
Part is about the cranial volume.
Oh brain size,
I guess,

36
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.350
but not that it was a separate species.

37
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.550
Cranium volume was calculated to be foreign in 30 million liters milliliters,

38
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.390
which puts it within the range of modern human living in the same region.

39
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.590
They went further comparing the size of the circumference of the Occipital,

40
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.160
said the word I said,

41
00:02:27.161 --> 00:02:30.870
little frontal section of the skull to patients with developmental disorders in

42
00:02:30.871 --> 00:02:34.050
that region.
The planet,
they found the measurements were indeed similar.

43
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.960
If lb one did have down syndrome,

44
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.780
then it would explain this short femurs as well.

45
00:02:39.781 --> 00:02:43.140
Hence when calculated statistically for normal growth,

46
00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:45.480
they would yield a height of just over four feet,

47
00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:49.920
which matches up with some humans living on Flores.
Wow.
Hmm.
This is,

48
00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:53.310
I think this is probably one of those heavily debated things,

49
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.380
but you're trying to recreate,
you know,

50
00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:59.090
there's a thing called island dwarfism that happens too.
Um,
it's,

51
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.450
it's a really odd,
because it happens to mammals,

52
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.680
but the opposite takes place with lizards and reptile.
Massive.
Yeah.

53
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:09.520
Reptiles get massive like Komodo dragons on the island.
The Komodo,
scariest.

54
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.810
Fun of giant.

55
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.160
They get huge monitor lizards really essentially that are enormous.

56
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.840
Whereas elephants that live on islands get tiny.
They have these dwarf elephants.

57
00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:21.160
Yeah.
Yeah.

58
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:26.161
See that island morphis room to have to cover so no less resources.

59
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.440
So they adapt to the taxes.
Less food.

60
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.930
Like look how tiny that elephant is that lives on those.

61
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:36.460
I mean it's an elephant that's like shorter than you wow.
And elephants through.

62
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.600
Yeah.
It's,
look,
that's like a elephant.
That's like my kid's height.

63
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.010
Like this is,
it happens with all sorts of different animals.
He Dwarf Buffalo.

64
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.110
Yeah.
Island dwarfism.

65
00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:50.950
They think it's because these animals adapt to the fact that there's just a

66
00:03:50.951 --> 00:03:53.960
limited amount of living on a territory.
Right.

67
00:03:53.961 --> 00:03:56.170
They don't have to cover long distances to get to something.
Yeah.

68
00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.700
It's fucking crazy.
What happens with animals,
man,

69
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.020
when they figure out like what they need to do to survive.

70
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.300
Like one of the things that a I was reading about really recently was,
um,
these,

71
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.870
fuck,
I wish I had it off the top of my head,

72
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.550
but these moths that lived in a separate area,

73
00:04:15.551 --> 00:04:20.551
an area where things were darker and they change from a light colored moth to a

74
00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:25.570
black moth,
like really quickly.
Really?
Yeah.
Like really quickly.

75
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:28.900
Like they did it over a couple of generations and they're trying to figure out

76
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:30.130
how the fuck this happened.

77
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.120
See if he could find that couple generations go false peppered moth.
Yeah.

78
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.430
Really fast.
Like it,
it blew them away.

79
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.540
They don't understand how it happened so quickly.
I think there's like,
there's,

80
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.310
there's so little that's truly understood about what adaptive changes can

81
00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:46.990
possibly happen within animals.
