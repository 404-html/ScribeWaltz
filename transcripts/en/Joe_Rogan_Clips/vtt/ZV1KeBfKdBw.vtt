00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.470
So,
um,
yeah,
so MMA,
who named it mixed martial arts,

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.490
you know,
that's a look it,
that's a whole story.

3
00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:11.510
And you're going to hear it was you.
Well,
I,

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.560
I give credit to Jeff Blatnick as far as looking at,
ah,

5
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.970
he didn't come up with the term who did,
but the truth that,
you know,

6
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.500
and this is the first thing I can tell you,
I wrote,
I wrote a,
uh,

7
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.930
I had to do it what's called a work permit for LAPD because I worked for LAPD

8
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.180
back in 1993,
93,
[inaudible] 94.

9
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.520
And it was because I was going to referee the second UFC,

10
00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:45.750
which was March 11th in 1994.
And for me to actually work,

11
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.240
the department has to allow me to,

12
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.570
I have to ask for permission and then they have to grant that permission.

13
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.240
Was there a concern that it was too outrageous?

14
00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:57.960
So that was part of the whole thing is I didn't want to say,
oh,

15
00:00:57.961 --> 00:00:59.340
I got two guys going into a cage.

16
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.810
They're going to beat the shit out of each other.

17
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.940
So the first thing I put was martial arts.
Referee.
Okay.

18
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.160
And then they said,
well,
what kind of martial arts?

19
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.040
So I wrote mixed martial arts referee.

20
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.820
Now I can tell you that that was in 90 right at the end of 93 where did you get

21
00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:18.384
out of term?

22
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.780
I didn't get it from anywhere other than I'm sitting there trying to think of,

23
00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:24.240
but I do know that there was a columnist,

24
00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:29.241
a sports writer from the La Times that wrote about the very first UFC and in his

25
00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:35.380
article wrote mixed martial arts.
Ah,
so maybe it was him so,

26
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.920
well you got John Perretti,
he's saying that he's,
you know,

27
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.990
he did it back in 1983 and it's like,
okay,
well if no one's saying it,

28
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.190
it doesn't mean shit.
Right.
Okay.
So the truth of the matter is,

29
00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:49.980
so Peretti might have said it in 83 it might've said it,

30
00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:53.670
but it didn't mean anything because the fact of the matter is,

31
00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:58.120
and it doesn't matter what I wrote,
what matters is when,
you know,

32
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.870
when you joined it,
when you joined the UFC,

33
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.950
it was still considered no holds barred.
NHB Yeah.

34
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.850
And it be was what we called and it was something that was,
and this is,
you know,

35
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.740
prob probably part of my problem with Campbell.

36
00:02:10.741 --> 00:02:14.640
Mclaren is back at you before UFC too.
You know,

37
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.810
they had them on Good Morning America with Jim Brown and you go back to that and

38
00:02:18.811 --> 00:02:22.380
he came up with the line that you could win by knockout,

39
00:02:22.381 --> 00:02:25.140
tap out or death.
Okay.

40
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.800
And four years after that,

41
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.830
I was in court having that thrown in my face by the fricking attorney trying to

42
00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:38.870
put us down and saying,
isn't this what you are companies?
No,

43
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.660
that's not what my committee says.
That's what an idiot said.
Okay.

44
00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:47.290
And so he still to this day thinks he was magnificent with that.
Okay.

45
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.240
But you look and you go,
might have been in terms of buying it drew attention,

46
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.390
paper view,
it drew attention.
There's no doubt.

47
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.440
But when we were trying to combat that,

48
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.080
we were trying to get away from no holds barred because no,
no holds barred met.

49
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.690
There's no rules.
And there was rules.
