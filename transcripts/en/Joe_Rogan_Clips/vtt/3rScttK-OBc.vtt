1
00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.300
But you got to do that.
Whenever I hear people talk too much about politics,

2
00:00:03.301 --> 00:00:05.670
even myself included my own words,
I'm like,

3
00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:08.220
you're talking about like a rigged game.
It's like you're,

4
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.110
it's like you're talking about pro wrestling.

5
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.070
It's like you're talking about something that's you pretending that it's real,

6
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.400
but you know what you know,
you know,

7
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.980
of course the government is corrupt as fuck,

8
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.540
but when you're talking about stuff like that,
like it are,
the election's rigged.

9
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.980
Our,
um,
do our votes count.
The one thing that I learned from this,
this,

10
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.040
these midterms is that if your vote didn't count and it was an and a,

11
00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:36.000
it's all decided like pro wrestling,

12
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.010
then there wouldn't be all this voter fraud and all these,
uh,

13
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.900
computers that can not,
you know what I'm talking about?
I'm not sure.

14
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.260
I'm gonna have to get a,
I'm talking about the way,
once you're in office,

15
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:49.330
the way things get,
nothing,
they're not decisions since now I get it.

16
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.410
But when I'm saying this from,
from,
uh,
the elections,

17
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:54.840
you see that your vote's do matter.

18
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.100
There's a lot of corruption and fraud going on.
But if it was all rigged,

19
00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:03.220
like WWE,
they wouldn't need to do all that.
They were like,
no,

20
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.090
it's still,

21
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.840
it's still the real system because a lot of people think it's not a real system.

22
00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:10.651
Like it doesn't matter.

23
00:01:10.651 --> 00:01:13.260
They already decided and they're just going to put them in.
No.
The way they,

24
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.400
they actually decide is,

25
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.960
is they decide who they're going to rig the machines full.
Yes.

26
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.930
But the vote's still count.
You just got to make sure that there's no,
uh,

27
00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:25.900
you know,
shenanigans going on.
I certainly do count,
but what would,

28
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.430
where it gets really squirrely,
and this is where politics get goofy,
is in,

29
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.740
why do politicians do what they do?

30
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.760
Do they do what they do to support the people or do they do what they do because

31
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:40.590
special interest groups of infant,
not only that,
here's what's really,
wow.
So,

32
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.310
so Capitol Hill,
when you're in Congress,
they call that the farm team.

33
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.970
Because in Capitol Hill you spent six years,
seven years,
let's just say,

34
00:01:47.971 --> 00:01:52.080
or a senator.
Now when you're a senator for,
I dunno,
10 years,

35
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.650
when you're on capital hill for as a congressman,
first six for 10 years,

36
00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.600
you develop real connections and relationships with government officials who

37
00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:03.660
make decisions.
You also understand how government works.

38
00:02:03.661 --> 00:02:07.020
You understand who's actually influencing who.
So now what do you do?

39
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.020
So let's say you lose an election or let's say you decide,

40
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.860
I bet I made my hundred and 60 grand a year,
can't really live on that money.

41
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.090
You go to k street,
you join a lobbying firm and,

42
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.290
and because you've been there for six or nine or 10 years,

43
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.190
you know a lot of people and that lobbying farm goes,
hey,

44
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.530
we'll pay $1 million now.

45
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.650
And all you gotta do is drive to Capitol Hill every day.

46
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.480
Get in there and influence,
use your connections so that we,

47
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.380
we can get what we want from government.
So corporations hiring,

48
00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:43.770
lobbying firms to lobby for their bottom line.

49
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.890
So now you're working to influence government.

50
00:02:46.891 --> 00:02:50.220
And the problem is when you were in Congress,
you know that,
you know,

51
00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:52.740
you have a job waiting.
If you can make great connections.

52
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.780
And now Washington becomes an economy of influence.
That's the game,
right?

53
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.690
Yes.
I'm fucking,
you gotta have a Lawrence Lessig on your God damn podcast.

54
00:03:01.691 --> 00:03:04.110
He can explain it.
He's a Harvard professor and that Motherfucker,

55
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.500
you tell me about the podcast you did with him.
He'll break it down.
I did.
Yeah.

56
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:12.400
Listen to that.
I'll say I sent it to you.
I think it's Lawrence Lessig.
He's,
he's,

57
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:13.750
he breaks it down.

58
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.020
He wrote a book called Republic lost and he's got a couple of Ted talks.

59
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.780
But that dude,
yes.
And basically he said,

60
00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:24.670
your government doesn't represent you and here's why.
Here's how it works.

61
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:28.420
When he breaks it down and you go,
it's simple the way he breaks it down,

62
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:31.930
cause he's a constitutional scholar out of Harvard when you were like,
fuck it.

63
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.790
And what he said was fascinating.
He said,

64
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.030
Washington's a place where even if you're a good person,

65
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.780
you must behave in a corrupt manner if you want to survive.

66
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.020
And that's when you have problems when good people have to behave correctly.

67
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.030
Yeah.
Yeah.
The bright side,
the bright side of all that is,
uh,

68
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.150
the fact that there is like people getting suicided and bribery going on,

69
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.810
that that means that there's hope,

70
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:59.170
that there's good people inside the government that you got to watch,

71
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.470
you gotta Watch your ass or you know,
we're going to have,

72
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.360
we got to hire someone because we don't want to go to jail.

73
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.390
So the fact that all that's done,
I'm gonna kill you.
They can just get you out.

74
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.190
Or,
you know what I'm saying is the fact that there is all that bribery and

75
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.390
suiciding,
that means that there's good people in there that are,

76
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.190
are going after,
uh,
the bad people.
But to me,

77
00:04:21.191 --> 00:04:23.950
I look at the bright side as I used to think,
there was no hope.

78
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.810
I used to think fuck it.
Like when,
when the bushes were an office,
Clinton,
Obama,

79
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.370
I was like,
I didn't pay attention to shit.
I just said they're all corrupt.

80
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.210
It's all rigged and it's all,
you know,
there's nothing you could do about it.
But,

81
00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:39.700
um,
you know,
over the last couple of years,
you know,

82
00:04:39.701 --> 00:04:42.610
since Trump got into office now I'm like paying attention.

83
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.480
There are some good people trying to do some good shit.
Like Trey Gowdy.

84
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.750
Listen to that motherfucker.
Trey Gowdy.
He's a bad motherfucker.

85
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.540
What are you talking about?
Gates?
No politician with these people.

86
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.370
The congressmen.
Oh Man,
there are great people going after the bad people.

87
00:04:57.371 --> 00:05:01.000
That's why there needs to be bribes and suiciding and blackmail.

88
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.280
The reason there's black males,
because there's good people in there.

89
00:05:03.281 --> 00:05:06.150
If everybody was bad,
they would.
Why would you blackmail anybody?

90
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.320
The problem is it's really subtle the way they can get you out though.

91
00:05:08.321 --> 00:05:12.510
Because when your donors are telling you which way to vote,
you're,

92
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.310
you as a politician go in there with all your ideas and you can't vote your

93
00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:19.150
conscience.
There's,
you got to put a lot of bad shit.
You got for show the money.

94
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.040
You're preaching to the choir over here.
I'm not going to defend.
So you fix that.

95
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:25.540
So,
so Lawrence Lessig has,

96
00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:29.200
one of the ideas he talks about is anonymous donations.
So,

97
00:05:29.201 --> 00:05:32.590
so watch your a politician,
right?
I'm a corporation.

98
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.000
I give your a or an eye through a super PAC or whatever it might be.

99
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:41.560
I give your campaign a lot of money.
Now you're a regular dude.

100
00:05:41.561 --> 00:05:43.600
You're not corrupt.
But human beings,

101
00:05:43.601 --> 00:05:46.420
when somebody gives them a real hand when they needed it,

102
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.560
you can't help but to feel a little indebted.
Of course.
What if all,

103
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.270
what if there are two ideas?

104
00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:55.930
What if you had a voucher system with all of us were given a certain amount of

105
00:05:55.931 --> 00:06:00.680
money every election cycle and we were allowed anonymously to give that money to

106
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:02.930
whoever we thought was a viable candidate.

107
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:08.170
It be anonymous or what if all donations were anonymous?

108
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:10.940
What if you didn't,
if you couldn't say who it was from,

109
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.300
but if you know you got a lot of stuff from GE or you know you've got a lot of

110
00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:19.301
stuff from Lockheed and there's a bill that comes up for Saudi Arabia to buy a

111
00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:21.770
bunch of tanks or whatever,
or weaponry,

112
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.040
it's going to be very hard for you to vote against that.
And if you do,

113
00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:27.680
those people that got you in power last time aren't going to get you empowered

114
00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:29.780
them basically figured out a way to make bribing legal.

115
00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.570
This is just to give you stuff the way it works,
Bro.

116
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.400
Take care of you and you add money to your campaign,

117
00:06:34.401 --> 00:06:37.550
but then don't exactly tell you what to do,
right?
But you know what the fuck.
