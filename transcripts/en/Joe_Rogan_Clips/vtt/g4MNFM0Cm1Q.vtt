Hello Freak bitches.
What comes to ball?

2
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.470
What's the effect on my mind of looking at my Twitter ad mentioned?

3
00:00:08.471 --> 00:00:11.620
So I wondered that when you were asking people what kind of questions they said,

4
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.840
yeah,
we should ask what we'll send this podcast.

5
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.080
Sometimes it's incredibly useful.
I was thinking of what you're doing.

6
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.040
You're opening yourself up to the green frog.
Yeah.

7
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.590
But I've had both kinds of experience.
I've,

8
00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:28.530
I've had people send me articles that I would have never found otherwise are

9
00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:30.540
fascinating and super useful and it's just a,

10
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.900
it's like this is the perfect use of this technology.
And then again,
then I,

11
00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:38.880
then I get this river of green frogs and weirdness.
Um,
but the,

12
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.430
but the,
to the previous point,

13
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.090
I pay attention to something for long stretches of time rather than do in

14
00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:51.000
something I know is good for me with my attention.

15
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.760
I kind of spin the roulette wheel with,

16
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.790
with Twitter and rather often there's just this kind of toxic undercurrent of,

17
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.930
of,
you know,
mental activity that it produces in me that,

18
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.840
um,
I mean doesn't make me feel,
I mean,

19
00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:12.600
it doesn't equip me to do anything better in my life.

20
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.250
It doesn't make me feel any better about myself or other people.
I mean,
if it,

21
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.630
if it has any net effect,
it's,

22
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.370
it basically grabbed a dozen dials that I can just sort of dimly conceive of in

23
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:27.000
my mind and turn them all a little bit toward the negative.
You know,

24
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:30.180
I feel a little bit worse about myself,
a little bit worse about my career,

25
00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:32.270
a little bit worse about people,
a little bit,

26
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.680
a little bit worse about the future.

27
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.050
Little bit worse about the fact that I just was doing this when I could have

28
00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:38.670
been playing with my kid or,

29
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.280
or writing or thinking productive thoughts or meditating or doing so.

30
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.260
You still do,
you still do this?
I still check Twitter compulsion.

31
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.420
Yeah.
You,
you argue with people.
I found that fascinating.
Yeah.
Not,

32
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.900
don't I go,
I go for,
I go for weeks without argument.
People.
Well,

33
00:01:57.901 --> 00:02:01.420
but also you argue with people on your podcast.
Well,
yeah,
but that's right.

34
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.460
That's different.
No,
no,
but I mean it,

35
00:02:03.461 --> 00:02:06.270
just on the podcast you'll also be talking about people you're arguing with on

36
00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:11.130
Twitter or so the arguing is a part of your,

37
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.920
well,
I get trolled a lot on Twitter.
I get trolled.
I mean,

38
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.260
you have guests,

39
00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:20.310
you have guests who come on your podcast and savage me on the podcast and then

40
00:02:20.311 --> 00:02:24.960
troll me endlessly on Twitter and like Abby,
Abby Martin.
Well she was,
no,

41
00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:27.960
she doesn't show it.
I mean she,
she,
she hates me,
but she,
I don't,

42
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.740
I haven't noticed her trolling me.
But now you got in a room with her.

43
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.110
Everybody would calm down.
She just has,

44
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.870
there's people that have radical misconceptions of who you are.

45
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.150
I'm sure you heard the Josh steps,
Patton Oswald thing or Patton Oswald.
Don't,

46
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.100
don't listen to it because he went off the rem pod,
went off the rails,
like,

47
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.150
like Hannibal style went off.
Are you thinking of Andy Kindler?
Oh yes.
Okay.

48
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.650
I'm sorry,
did I say Patton Oswald?
I'm so sorry.
That's good.
So sorry.

49
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.890
Oswaldo patents.
Great,
good.
Well,

50
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.560
very smart and very reasonable as is Andy for the most,
most of the time.
But so,

51
00:03:03.561 --> 00:03:06.890
so then he's kind of crazy and discover this very late.
I did.

52
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.340
So I kept seeing this guy.
I didn't know who he was.

53
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:12.220
I kept seeing him in my Twitter feed,
Andy kindler and they can learn.

54
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:15.790
Then I realized,
wait a minute,
he is actually,
he seems to be,
I mean,

55
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:17.080
he's established comic.

56
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.910
He seems to be friends with people who I really respect who I don't know,

57
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:25.030
like,
you know,
like,
I mean Sarah Silverman,
who I,
I don't know personally.

58
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:29.200
I mean we've,
we've communicated a little bit on Twitter,
but it's like,
I,
I,

59
00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:33.390
I'm just nothing but a pure fan of,
of Sarah,
uh,
Jim Gaffigan,

60
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.440
other big comics.
So I totally respect,

61
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.400
I don't know how close he is with these people,
but he basically,

62
00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:43.630
he has endless energy for vilifying me as a racist and as a bigot.
Right?
I mean,

63
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:46.340
he's just,
he's a madman.
And I discovered,

64
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.350
so I did a search of his Twitter feed and he's got hundreds and hundreds of

65
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:55.120
tweets where he's,
he's going after me and the most retail way.
So for instance,

66
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:57.750
like I tweeted out a,

67
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.140
can anyone recommend 500 seat halls and all these cities and I think your friend

68
00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:05.740
is Duncan Trussell,
a friend of yours.
Okay.
So Duncan wrote back saying,
Oh yeah,

69
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:08.320
Dma,
I've got a great place in Boston or something.

70
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.650
And then Andy kindler jumped in to that thread talking to Duncan saying,

71
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.080
don't help him Duncan,
he's a bigot.
Right?
So like he's like,

72
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:20.020
this is Andy Kindler is just got endless energy for this.
And then I,

73
00:04:20.021 --> 00:04:21.330
then I looked at,
you know,

74
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.880
what he was doing and he had been doing it for years and I wasn't aware of it

75
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.280
just to you,
just to me and Bill Maher,
he's still more,

76
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.790
but then you've got another guy on this podcast.

77
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.860
Hunter mats had him on one.
Okay.

78
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.340
So he was on here and I actually had to go back and watch what he said here

79
00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:41.650
because I had been getting so much of this on Twitter.

80
00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:44.560
And I mean it's incredibly common.
People are tweeting at me saying,

81
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.750
why won't you debate a hunter?
It's mats,
right?
Why won't you debate hunter masks?

82
00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:51.910
I went back and looked at what he said here.
You know,

83
00:04:51.911 --> 00:04:55.150
half of it frankly didn't make any sense.
Um,

84
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.180
but his attacks on the,

85
00:04:58.181 --> 00:05:00.370
on Twitter are the most juvenile.

86
00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:03.670
It's like the idea that he thinks this is a way he's going to establish a

87
00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:08.671
conversation with me by sending me to tweets and then sending me 400 which say,

88
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.370
you're scared to debate me.
Right?
It's crap.
I mean,
I think he,

89
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.070
I don't know,
very,
very,
very smart guy,

90
00:05:18.071 --> 00:05:23.071
but taking a terrible socially retarded approach to establishing a debate.

91
00:05:23.081 --> 00:05:27.730
And I've contacted Brian Cowen about this and Brian Cowen contacted hunter about

92
00:05:27.731 --> 00:05:29.950
this and was like,
what the fuck are you doing?
And he continues to do it.

93
00:05:29.951 --> 00:05:32.350
Is that crazy behavior?
He said he wouldn't do it anymore.

94
00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:35.140
And then he did it with more,
I mean,
every time I look,
I,

95
00:05:35.141 --> 00:05:39.310
I see him somewhere in there.
And,
but then,
then there's this guy,
Mike Cernovich,

96
00:05:39.311 --> 00:05:43.370
who,
who's actually has effects on the real world.
I mean,

97
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:48.160
Mike Cernovich is again,
he said Twitter troll.
Um,
again,

98
00:05:48.161 --> 00:05:51.340
one of these other guys who's challenged me to debate him.
And I,
you know,

99
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.920
I mean there's,
there's,
there's no,
there's absolutely no possibility of dialogue.

100
00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.420
Yeah.
Listen,
Cernovich just was just on 60 minutes.
I mean,
he's like,

101
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.850
he's in the world and he's affecting people's conception of Trump psyche.

102
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.870
Oh yeah.
Well,
okay,
sure.
Right?
Yes.
So they could come back.
Is it,
it's not,

103
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:14.060
it's not,
it's not,
the nine times out of 10 looking just makes me think,

104
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.020
um,
I mean,
it's an illusion because if you met most of these people,
if you,

105
00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:21.380
if they came up to you at a conference or at a,
you know,
book sign in her,
so,

106
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:26.150
you know,
after a Gig of yours and you saw,
you had more information about them,

107
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:30.830
you saw all of the,
you know,
all of the crazy coming out.

108
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.600
Um,
you would say,
I don't have to pay any time.

109
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.370
There's no reason to pay attention to what this guy is saying.

110
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.570
Whereas on Twitter,
everything is how has the same stature.
So whether it's,

111
00:06:41.571 --> 00:06:45.620
you know,
a Washington Post columnist who's tweeting at me or some,

112
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.130
some guy like hunter who,
you know,
I had,
I have no idea who he is,

113
00:06:49.131 --> 00:06:51.530
but he's telling me I've got something wrong.
Um,

114
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.680
everything has the same stature and you just,

115
00:06:54.681 --> 00:06:57.800
there's no signal to noise sense of what you know.
Well first of all,

116
00:06:57.801 --> 00:07:01.540
you fucked up cause you talked about them both.

117
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.390
Well you said candy man five times and now you've got a problem and you talked

118
00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:08.230
about him right now on this page,
this is the first time I've ever mentioned,

119
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.130
but I'll go in and talk to you before that I'm bringing,

120
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.570
I'm bringing it to you because you,
you,
you created it.
I mean it was,
it was,

121
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.570
it was his,
it was his podcast with you.
They kicked this whole thing.

122
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.890
Oh I didn't think that a hundred was going to do that.

123
00:07:19.891 --> 00:07:22.070
And I know for a fact that hunter is actually a fan of yours.

124
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.380
I think what hunter's trying,
he's got a strange way of showing it.

125
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.450
I don't think it's a smart way.
I think what he's trying to do,
and he,

126
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.480
when I was trying to hold his feet to the fire and get some sort of a logical

127
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.070
definition of what you do wrong,
he really didn't have anything.

128
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.460
But he's willing,
but he thinks he does.
And he,
but did he,

129
00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:42.410
when I talked to him about it and no,
no.

130
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:46.580
And half of what he said about Dawkins and me was totally wrong and have what he

131
00:07:46.581 --> 00:07:50.840
said about the,
the relevant biology was wrong.
I mean he's just,
he's not,

132
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.340
he doesn't have his shit together,
but he thinks he does.

133
00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:59.830
And there's this,
there's a,
there's a level of,

134
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.150
of arrogance and,

135
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.980
and in civility and just kind of a lack of charity in,

136
00:08:06.981 --> 00:08:09.830
in interacting with other people's views,

137
00:08:09.831 --> 00:08:14.831
which is now kind of getting rebranded on the Internet as just just American can

138
00:08:17.211 --> 00:08:20.090
do Chutzpah.
Right.
And it's like,
it's given us Trump,
right?

139
00:08:20.091 --> 00:08:21.850
It's like you've got a,
Trump is the ultimate example.

140
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:24.560
He's like the cartoon version of,
you know,

141
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.340
a person who doesn't know anything relevant to the enterprise,

142
00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.230
who doesn't show any,
uh,

143
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:37.030
aptitude for civilly engaging with differences of opinion.

144
00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.420
And this thing gets amplified to the,

145
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:45.260
to the place of greatest prominence.
Now in human history,

146
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:49.250
everyone's on social media or many people on social media are playing the same

147
00:08:49.251 --> 00:08:52.900
game.
And,
you know,
Ms Cernovich's and another,
you know,

148
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:58.050
just malignant example of this where you have someone who's got a fairly large

149
00:08:58.051 --> 00:09:00.900
following.
I mean,
it's not as big as yours,
but it's,
you know,
it's,

150
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:05.670
it's a very engaged following the,
I mean,
this whole Trump phenomenon has,
has,

151
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.360
has,
uh,
shown me that Pete,
that if a small percentage of,

152
00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:14.361
of one's audience can have like a hundred times the energy of the rest of your

153
00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:18.950
audience.
Like whenever I went against Trump on my podcast or is,

154
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:23.940
is still the case,
the,
the level of,
of pain it causes in,

155
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:28.860
in the sort of the feedback space is completely out of proportion to the numbers

156
00:09:28.861 --> 00:09:33.530
of people who are,
who are,
um,
you know,
on that side of the argument.
And it's so,

157
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.620
it's incredibly energized,

158
00:09:34.621 --> 00:09:39.621
but it's just this weird style of self promotion where you,

159
00:09:39.921 --> 00:09:42.900
all you do is that you brag about yourself,
you say you're the best,

160
00:09:42.901 --> 00:09:44.310
your [inaudible],
you're,
you're,

161
00:09:44.311 --> 00:09:49.311
you're someone who has absolutely no basis to back up those claims.

162
00:09:49.471 --> 00:09:50.010
And yet,

163
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:55.010
and audience thrills to that level of arrogance and an empty boast.

164
00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:56.220
It's

165
00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.670
<v 1>just bizarre.
But,
well,
there's a,</v>

166
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:03.730
there's a big issue I think online where people find likeminded people and then

167
00:10:04.611 --> 00:10:09.230
they develop these communities where they just support each other and they just

168
00:10:09.231 --> 00:10:12.890
have these,
these gigantic groups of people.
I mean,

169
00:10:12.891 --> 00:10:14.630
not even necessarily gigantic,

170
00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:19.070
but groups of people that find any subject.
Like for me,

171
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.830
you know what it is flat earth,
right?

172
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.480
I get trolled by people all day that claim I'm a sellout because I don't believe

173
00:10:26.481 --> 00:10:29.000
the earth is flat.
Mr Is real.

174
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.230
<v 2>But don't think that there's a,
there's a,</v>

175
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:36.600
I think this phenomenon that you're describing is both,
um,

176
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.910
has really serious negative consequences,

177
00:10:38.911 --> 00:10:43.620
but it also has some beauty on the same.
By the same token,
you've got parents,
uh,

178
00:10:43.621 --> 00:10:47.280
all over the world who've got children with a rare disease,

179
00:10:47.281 --> 00:10:50.670
but they can connect on the internet and bond over that and share tips and

180
00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.670
doctors.
So it is,
it's actually,

181
00:10:53.671 --> 00:10:57.290
they're both outgrowths of the same kind of phenomenon,
but he can be,

182
00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:02.280
we see the,
the really difficult,
uh,

183
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.910
consequences of this in our politics right now,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

184
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:07.780
I think we're talking about two different things.
You think so?
I'm

185
00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:09.070
<v 1>talking about confirmation bias.</v>

186
00:11:09.071 --> 00:11:12.340
I'm talking about a bunch of people that get together and say,
yeah,
obviously,
uh,

187
00:11:12.341 --> 00:11:16.770
I'm woke and the earth is flat and pay attention is an odd analogy allowing ice

188
00:11:16.771 --> 00:11:19.570
ball.
Yes.
But there are different things.

189
00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.710
The groups of people that will find communities where maybe your child has

190
00:11:23.711 --> 00:11:27.790
autism and there's some sort of an issue,
uh,
that can be mitigated with diet.

191
00:11:27.791 --> 00:11:32.020
And parents have had some success with that and they could give you some

192
00:11:32.021 --> 00:11:34.630
enlightening information and you can communicate with each other.

193
00:11:34.631 --> 00:11:36.040
And that's nice.
It's beautiful.

194
00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.850
And I'm some of the hashtags that people use that they've,

195
00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:41.170
they find search through,
it's great,

196
00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:44.940
but you know that these little communities that you bond,
that they're not,

197
00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.770
that's those,
those ideas.

198
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.530
There's no confirmation bias and those ideas.

199
00:11:50.531 --> 00:11:53.470
But there's confirmation bias and the idea that Trump is,
man,

200
00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.590
there's confirmation bias and the idea that the earth is flat,
you know,

201
00:11:56.591 --> 00:12:00.670
and if you just huddle in those little communities and just bark the same noises

202
00:12:00.671 --> 00:12:04.390
that everybody else barks,
there's some sort of sense of community in that too.

203
00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:08.980
<v 2>Yes.
And people love that.
They love being a part of a fucking team.</v>

204
00:12:08.981 --> 00:12:11.920
Even if it's a stupid team of green frogs and you don't have love it.

205
00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:16.030
You don't have to listen to other people's views and you get deeply,

206
00:12:16.031 --> 00:12:17.590
deeply entrenched.
I think we're seeing,

207
00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:21.370
we're seeing this all through our politics and media right now.
Well,

208
00:12:21.371 --> 00:12:24.790
you also see when you go to those people's pages,
which I do

209
00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:28.620
<v 1>often,
I don't engage with people in a negative way online very often.
Very,</v>

210
00:12:28.621 --> 00:12:31.920
very rarely.
Do you not look at your ad mentions,
are you?
A little bit,

211
00:12:31.921 --> 00:12:35.550
but do you know what man?
I just like to just go on about my day.
Yeah,
I've,

212
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:39.640
I've found that the negative consequences that you're discussing,
I mean I read,

213
00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.490
I mean it's rare that I go down the rabbit hole and I go for days without

214
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:47.970
looking at ad mentioned.
I mean it's,
it's more that if I publish something,

215
00:12:47.971 --> 00:12:50.430
if we are,
if I asked for feedback,
I want to see the feedback.

216
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:54.640
<v 2>It's not necessarily useful.
There's anything,
well,
I mean,
just as your friend.</v>

217
00:12:54.641 --> 00:12:57.130
I mean I feel like there's nothing wrong with it.
I look at my app mentions,

218
00:12:57.131 --> 00:13:00.130
but um,
but you,
you junction in a very different space.
I mean,

219
00:13:00.131 --> 00:13:03.100
you're not pushing controversial stuff out there that definitely not.

220
00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:06.860
Definitely not.
So I agree.
I stayed,
I'm fine.
I'm sorry,
go ahead.

221
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.330
I was just more worried about,
again,
health,
your psyche.

222
00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.350
It's feels like you need a little bit of a middle.
Yeah.

223
00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.240
<v 1>Yeah.
I stay offline after UFC for the most part.</v>

224
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.820
That's when I get the most crazy people,

225
00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.390
especially if there's any sort of a controversial decision.
But there,

226
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.070
are they criticizing you for something you said or they get fucking mad at my

227
00:13:26.071 --> 00:13:29.820
commentary.
They'll just disagree with who I thought water and been,

228
00:13:29.821 --> 00:13:32.490
they're so fucking vicious about it.
I'm just like,
just yell.

229
00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.120
Just yelling your own.
You don't want to see any of that.
There's too many people.

230
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:39.540
You're dealing with millions and millions of people and who knows how many of

231
00:13:39.541 --> 00:13:41.580
them are rational when you're dealing with,
you know,

232
00:13:41.581 --> 00:13:44.330
there's a bit that I had one of my specials where I was talking about the,

233
00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:46.950
the number of people that are stupid in the world.

234
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.770
Like if you get a room full of a hundred people,

235
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.860
the idea that one person isn't a complete fucking idiot.

236
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.760
Of course you're being very charitable and being chairman one.
Yeah.

237
00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:00.030
But if you do that,
we are talking about 300 million people in the United States.

238
00:14:00.031 --> 00:14:02.750
Plus that's 3 million fucking idiots.
Yeah.

239
00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.630
So if you have 3 million fucking idiots and all your ad mentions,

240
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:10.650
if you look at your ad mentions in 3 million comments are saying you're a

241
00:14:10.651 --> 00:14:14.490
fucking moron.
And the just,
just too many people,

242
00:14:14.491 --> 00:14:17.550
the numbers are,
they're not manageable.

243
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.820
The numbers of human beings you interact with online are not manageable.

244
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:25.620
So anytime anything gets negative or insulting,
and I just check out,

245
00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.490
I just,
next,
next,
next,
I don't pay attention because you can't.

246
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:32.580
But if I fucked up and I know I fucked up,

247
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:36.170
I think one of the most important things that I do is I admit that I fuck you.

248
00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:40.890
And I talk about it and I apologize and I say,
look,
I'm flawed.
I'm human.

249
00:14:40.891 --> 00:14:43.710
I made a mistake.
Sorry.
And then just step away.

250
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.530
Let the fucking chaos and sue in the comments.

251
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:50.040
But all the people call you a shill and a whatever,
let all that happen.

252
00:14:50.041 --> 00:14:51.950
But don't let in like

253
00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:55.730
<v 0>you're letting it in and then you stew on it and you have to bring up,
you know,</v>

254
00:14:55.731 --> 00:15:00.670
a hunter and all these other people and that's you.
You're letting them way too.

255
00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:04.610
No,
no,
no.
I mean,
perhaps I gave a false impression of,

256
00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:07.550
of how under my skin this has gotten,
just in fact,

257
00:15:07.551 --> 00:15:09.620
he talked about it at all of those too much.
Well,
no,

258
00:15:09.621 --> 00:15:11.570
but I th I think it's a huge consequence,

259
00:15:11.571 --> 00:15:14.960
but I think it's given us Trump this way,
this,
this way.

260
00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:20.490
The fact that this style of communication is attractive to so many people.

261
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:26.410
The fact that you can the bluff and bluster and empty boast and lies with being

262
00:15:27.471 --> 00:15:31.610
caught in lies without consequence.
Um,
the fact that,
that,

263
00:15:31.611 --> 00:15:34.990
that people never admit mistakes.
I mean the,
the,
the,
you know,

264
00:15:34.991 --> 00:15:38.060
what you just described to you,
you do.
And which I do,
you know,

265
00:15:38.061 --> 00:15:40.010
you make a mistake,
you want to hear about it.

266
00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:42.170
You want to correct it as quickly as possible.
Right?

267
00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:46.080
That is the antithesis of what we're seeing now in this space.
I mean,

268
00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:50.680
when has Trump admitted a mistake?
But isn't it the difference being that you,

269
00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.740
neither you nor I have any desire to control anything.
Like I don't,

270
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.930
I don't want to be the leader of anything.
Well,
no,

271
00:15:56.931 --> 00:16:00.800
but you want effective can you want good ideas to win and you want the truth to

272
00:16:00.801 --> 00:16:03.560
win.
You want the truth to propagate what facts to propagate.

273
00:16:03.561 --> 00:16:06.290
You want to be able to correct errors,
whether they're your own or others,

274
00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:10.250
especially when they're consequential.
And I think that we need a,

275
00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:15.230
we need a common ethic where lying has real consequences.
I mean,

276
00:16:15.231 --> 00:16:19.100
what so many people are trying to figure out what's the antidote to fake news?

277
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:23.630
Well,
one antidote is to be caught.

278
00:16:23.631 --> 00:16:28.040
Line has to be devastating for your career,
right?

279
00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:30.830
Like it hit politically,
journalistically,

280
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:34.850
academically as a,
as a public intellectual,
I mean,

281
00:16:34.851 --> 00:16:39.851
to be caught in a whopping lie without a will require at minimum,

282
00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:46.140
some serious atonement.
And historically it has been so many,

283
00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:50.000
we have slipped those rails just to,

284
00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:51.710
to a degree that I had never thought possible.

285
00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.860
We're going lightspeed right into the woods.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,

286
00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:57.050
we're talking about people have figured out how to,

287
00:16:57.051 --> 00:17:02.051
just to use dishonesty as extra fuel.

288
00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.930
I mean,
it's like,
it's like,
you know,
the,
the,

289
00:17:04.931 --> 00:17:09.020
the blue whatever that the nitrous oxide boost in those,
the hacky cars,
right?

290
00:17:09.021 --> 00:17:12.910
It's like we can use this stuff,
right.
And the getting the,

291
00:17:12.911 --> 00:17:17.350
the way you behave when you get caught,
just,
Eh,

292
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:19.310
which is to say,
just go fuck yourself.

293
00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:24.590
Just redounds to your credibility in your,
among your tribe.
Right.

294
00:17:24.591 --> 00:17:27.260
It's like this guy is so powerful.
He,
he,
he,

295
00:17:27.261 --> 00:17:31.970
he so fully doesn't give a shit what people think that he can catch him in a lie

296
00:17:31.971 --> 00:17:35.630
and just watch how he,
he gets out of it.
Um,
and,
but that's,

297
00:17:35.631 --> 00:17:40.580
that's what I was bringing up these guys like Cernovich I mean this,
this is,
um,

298
00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:44.470
I actually,
I,
I trolled Crna,
I decided to troll Cernovich one day and I,

299
00:17:44.471 --> 00:17:47.030
I thought it was hilarious and I,
it was just nothing but fun.

300
00:17:47.031 --> 00:17:48.650
So there was something toxic about that.

301
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.823
<v 2>But,</v>

302
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:55.950
but the thing that bothers me is that this has real political consequences.

303
00:17:55.951 --> 00:17:57.740
And I,
you know,
do you think that this is a,

304
00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:02.190
this is a time period where we're in the sort of adolescent stage of

305
00:18:02.191 --> 00:18:05.970
communication online where you can get away with saying things that are

306
00:18:05.971 --> 00:18:09.750
dishonest and that there might be some sort of a way to mitigate that in the

307
00:18:09.751 --> 00:18:10.860
future.
There might be some,

308
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:14.910
I don't think we should act like dishonesty and bluff and bluster to use a

309
00:18:14.911 --> 00:18:18.120
phrase you used before is started somehow knew,
did he?
Human Repertoire.

310
00:18:18.121 --> 00:18:19.230
I get that.

311
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:23.820
The acceptance of it seems to be though I think we're in a period where that is

312
00:18:23.821 --> 00:18:25.070
true and I think it did,

313
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:29.880
is aided and abetted by technology and the social networks.

314
00:18:29.881 --> 00:18:32.660
I agree with your diagnosis on many levels,
but I,
you know,

315
00:18:32.661 --> 00:18:36.540
it's having an interesting conversation with a guy that you introduced me to,

316
00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:39.590
Joseph Goldstein,
who was,
uh,
uh,

317
00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:43.690
eminent meditation teacher has become my meditation teacher,
old friend of Sam's.

318
00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:46.320
And he was saying,
we were talking about the current political situation.

319
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:49.290
He used a phrase that I like when I was asked him what he thought about it.

320
00:18:49.291 --> 00:18:52.230
He said,
I'm kind of slotting into geological time,

321
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:56.760
and I think that actually makes some sense.
Not to say that,
what does that mean?

322
00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:01.920
Meaning that I'm just viewing it from a far,

323
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:05.220
I'm widening the Lens to look at the broad

324
00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.270
scope of human history to see that,
you know,

325
00:19:09.271 --> 00:19:12.120
over time we've got these ups and downs.

326
00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:15.090
He's getting to the top of the mountain near Denver with a big bucket of

327
00:19:15.091 --> 00:19:17.610
Margarita.
That's exactly right.
That's exactly right.

328
00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.800
There's slotting in and sliding it.
Yeah.

329
00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:30.040
<v 3>Okay.</v>
