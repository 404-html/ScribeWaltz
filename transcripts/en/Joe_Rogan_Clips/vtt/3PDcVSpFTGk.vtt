1
00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.350
It happens in Brazil to celebrities or one for one of our,

2
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.290
one of our,
uh,
one of our most famous congressmen's.

3
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:12.960
It was a big brother.
Oh No,

4
00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:15.960
that was a big brother and that big brother shows so ridiculous.

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.060
That's the worst way to become a celebrity.

6
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.770
One of the most watched shows in Brazil.
That's crazy.
What Bree,

7
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.750
why don't people watched that much?
He had the due date.

8
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.650
How know anymore that they still think so for sure.

9
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.620
Crazy thing was Amarosa Amarosa who was one of the big,

10
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.390
she was a big stash was the White House brand is before that she was on fear

11
00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:39.150
factor.
I was the host.

12
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:43.230
I didn't know I had a fucking altercation with her on fear factor.
Not a bad one,

13
00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:45.810
but she's,
she keeps me being drunk.
She's like,

14
00:00:45.811 --> 00:00:47.970
cause I was asking her questions like that doesn't make sense.
She was joke,

15
00:00:47.971 --> 00:00:51.150
you're drunk.
I'm like,
I'm not drunk or you can't just say I'm drunk.

16
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.630
She wasn't thinking this.
The feedback it would be for the apprentice.
No,

17
00:00:54.631 --> 00:00:59.180
she was on something else first before the apprentice.
I think that was it.

18
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.370
What's she on?
The apprentice and then fear factor come on.

19
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.460
Was fear factor before the apprentice?
Same time.

20
00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:07.890
Just before she got famous for being on the apprentice.

21
00:01:07.891 --> 00:01:10.700
She was on like the second season maybe.
Yeah,
I really did.

22
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.730
I think she was on another show first and then the apprentice,

23
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.490
she went to another reality show after dip brand is,

24
00:01:17.491 --> 00:01:19.800
I don't know who I remember that.
Yeah.

25
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.640
Well the crazy thing is she went from the White House to big brother.

26
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.020
She was actually on the first season of the apprentice.
Oh,
what year was that?

27
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.580
So she was on celebrity fear factor.
We had three,
four,

28
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:36.541
three.
Okay.

29
00:01:36.541 --> 00:01:41.070
So she must've been on fear factor like 2005 she was nice though.

30
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.660
She's just,
but she just told me I was drunk.
I was like,
what?
She wasn't elected.

31
00:01:45.661 --> 00:01:50.370
Right.
She wasn't,
she was appointed by Trump.
But Trump gave,

32
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.860
so here's what's fucked up.
Here's what's really,

33
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.690
I was reading an article about the what the problems with what she did when she

34
00:01:57.691 --> 00:02:01.950
was in the situation room and these secured White House rooms.

35
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.560
She had her fucking phone recording.

36
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.640
So she's sitting there recording shit in the middle of these,

37
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.980
these like totally secure rooms.
She's required,

38
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.040
like Trump is talking,
she's got a phone there.
Hmm.
Interesting.

39
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.640
And she's recording everything on her fucking fault.

40
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.790
And she has like hours and hours of footage of record recordings rather,

41
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.710
which you're not supposed to do.

42
00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:30.711
It's like you can literally Russians and Chinese and the Iranians and all the,

43
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.700
anybody that wants to tune in could hack into her fucking phone,

44
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.020
turn the microphone on.

45
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.000
And this is absolute proven technology and they're using that to listen in the

46
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:43.050
middle of the situation room.

47
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:45.990
So if there's some sort of top secret shit that's going on,

48
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.430
some foreign entity could be listening in through her phone while she's

49
00:02:50.431 --> 00:02:52.350
recording.
I don't think they see the ignorant.

50
00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:54.960
I don't think they need all of that is just called Trump and ask what happened.

51
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.370
They'll tell you what happened.
I'm like,
okay.
But I mean,
he's low.

52
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.300
He allowed her this,
you know,
I don't know if she's unstable,

53
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.140
but she seems a little unstable to t.

54
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.940
That's a such a very dangerous thing to do.

55
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:13.450
You're not even supposed to bring your fucking phone in those rooms and for her

56
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:17.620
to be recording,
recording everything,
that's like,
great,
this is so crazy,

57
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.810
but so selfish to like if you are acting in the best,

58
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.920
you're in a position when you're working for the White House,

59
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:27.190
you're working for Donald Trump.
He's the president of the United States,

60
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:31.510
the biggest super power in the fucking world,
and you're just recording things.

61
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.910
God,
I know that you want to serve yourself.
I know you want to help yourself out,

62
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:40.120
but God,
that seems so crazy.
You do.

63
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.720
I mean if you were Trump and you hired her and you found out she was recording

64
00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:47.680
everything in the situation room,
you must be like,
oh,

65
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.140
like in conferences with like,
like they're talking about important policy.

66
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.170
She's got her phone recording and anybody can be limited,

67
00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.180
but if you think about it like it's crazy for a human to you to give her some,

68
00:04:00.801 --> 00:04:04.790
some creditability because she wasn't apprentice.
He learned to think about it.

69
00:04:04.791 --> 00:04:07.820
Okay.
The president of the United States is the guy that was running a premise.

70
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.960
He liked her.
It may be feeling well,
look,
she's very artistic skillet.

71
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.570
She's good looking woman.
She knows how to speak well.

72
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.520
She's got a lot of confidence and power.

73
00:04:17.521 --> 00:04:21.060
He probably figured she'd be a great politician.
Perfect.
I'm a great politician.

74
00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:23.400
He's probably like,
I'm the fucking president.
I'll make her,

75
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.520
she'll say she's going to be my left hand lady or right hand lady.

76
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.340
It is not dated that difficult but at least in Brazil is not that difficult for

77
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.600
famous people to get elected in the one day where I was running for a

78
00:04:33.601 --> 00:04:38.601
congressman cause there's so many options and if you are known and you'll get

79
00:04:38.941 --> 00:04:41.760
like 1% of the voting,
you're already elected.

80
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.120
But if you go run for like a mayor or governor or governor or something,

81
00:04:47.441 --> 00:04:50.460
he becomes a little trickier because there's like five options and now you're

82
00:04:50.461 --> 00:04:54.090
running against real politics.
Real politicians will actually have a plan.

83
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.550
So we feel running out guys like 200 people.

84
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.400
You can shine a little because you're famous.
Yeah.

85
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.790
We're starting to see a little bit more than America.
Like Cynthia Nixon.

86
00:05:02.791 --> 00:05:04.140
She was on sex in the city,

87
00:05:04.141 --> 00:05:08.430
and then she ran for which he ran for governor in New York.
Oh yeah.
Go for it.

88
00:05:08.431 --> 00:05:09.091
Yeah.
So there's,

89
00:05:09.091 --> 00:05:13.820
there's a few that few that are starting to branch off into politics now.
It's,

90
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.900
I mean,
did it happen before Ronald Reagan because he was,
yes.

91
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.400
He's the most famous,
he,
I think he was a movie star.
He was a best bang,
right?

92
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.850
Yeah.
He was the first guy.
Joe Come back to the future.

93
00:05:23.851 --> 00:05:28.280
You mean like Ronald Reagan,
the movie star?
Yeah,

94
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.340
that was a,
that was the first.
He was the first,

95
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.430
he was also the first that introduced the option or his,

96
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.140
his cabinet was the first.
They got the people,
the,
his,

97
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.980
his team got the people from the religious right.
Involved.

98
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.030
Religion was not really a big part of voting before Ronald Reagan,

99
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.530
but Ronald Reagan,
and though that sort of kind of Republican,

100
00:05:50.531 --> 00:05:53.980
they got all these angelical Christians and evangelicals.
Okay.
Yeah.

101
00:05:53.981 --> 00:05:54.940
And the same thing in Brazil.
