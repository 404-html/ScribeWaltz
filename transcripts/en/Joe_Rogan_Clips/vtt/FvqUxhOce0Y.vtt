1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.780
Wonderboy.
Yeah.
Jon Jones.
Jon Jones,
Jon Jones or stolen.
No,

2
00:00:04.781 --> 00:00:07.470
fucking throwing everything or symbol of kit.

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.300
It's a very interesting watching him,
man.

4
00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:12.090
He's doing a lot of sidekicks now and and spinning back kicks.

5
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.980
Turning kicks late into the body.
Yeah,
he saw a lot of sidekicks.
He seats,

6
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.340
he throws a lot of everything man.
But he fucks you up.
He's just,

7
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.540
and he's so good at keeping guys in the back foot and just dismiss,

8
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.820
just taken away their arsenal.

9
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.440
I want to say this though because this is something that's coming up and it's

10
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:30.730
actually kind of pissing me off.
There's somebody who,

11
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.040
a bunch of people that have been saying,

12
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.130
should Anthony Smith have Tate have like laid down after he took that eel

13
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.090
illegal knee and won the title.
Who set this?

14
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.310
Ariel Helwani a bunch of other people said it.

15
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.360
I think Ariel was suggesting or asking whether or not he should have some Beta

16
00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:53.190
male shit.
Well,
it's crazy because the guy should be praised for he ate the knee.

17
00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:57.840
He was okay and then he wasn't even thinking about quitting.
Yeah.

18
00:00:57.841 --> 00:00:58.530
It even,

19
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.010
I didn't even go through my mind and went through my mind that someone might do

20
00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:06.720
that.
Some people will tell you that day,
Smith,
no,
it wasn't even a thought.

21
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.440
No,
nope,
nope.
It wasn't a thought.
I owned a great one and I wasn't like,
oh,

22
00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:13.950
we should all give him praise for this.
I was like,
well,
no.
Why would he do that?

23
00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:18.450
Well,
that's him.
That's who he is.
But some people like,
let's be honest,

24
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.620
and I think [inaudible] probably admit to this,
if he took that illegal knee,

25
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.570
he might say,
that's it.
Can't go on.
Sorry.
Rematch.
Well,

26
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.110
you get the chills.
Bismuth.
Yeah.
I mean you get the,
when you get the title,

27
00:01:31.111 --> 00:01:33.870
you get a rematch.
I could be wrong.
Shale might disagree.
Might say,
no,

28
00:01:33.871 --> 00:01:36.420
I'm a competitor when I'm in there.
I wouldn't,
wouldn't think that way.
Not,

29
00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:41.250
it is not now his agent,
but the bottom line is like some people were actually,

30
00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:45.450
she actually suggesting that that that would be a good option that he was,

31
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.340
the many people have suggested I saw several PN and that the fans went hard on

32
00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:53.430
these people that suggested it.
Like,
you're out of your fucking mind.

33
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.330
You're out of your fucking mind class.
That'd be such a bitch move.

34
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.880
Unless he actually couldn't go on.
Yeah.
But we all saw he could.
He goes,

35
00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:05.120
I'm fine.
He goes,
no,
no,
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Yeah,
exactly.

36
00:02:05.121 --> 00:02:10.050
What the Smith Think Smith stock went higher now.
Yes.
Go.
Oh Shit.

37
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:14.190
No,
he's top five for sure.
And he looked very good in the first round.

38
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.610
The first round look.
Very good.
John.
His take down a fence.
Yes.
Very good.

39
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.620
Very good.
John started figuring them out.

40
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.650
And John John is so good at forcing you to fight his fight and for [inaudible]

41
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.750
and being first.
He's so good at being first.

42
00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:30.480
First with the kicks and the punches first forward.
You know,

43
00:02:30.481 --> 00:02:33.150
he doesn't give you a chance.
And that's the thing with Anthony Smith.

44
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.170
Anthony Smith chance was to always be first if cash Shanthi Smith's fights
prior.

45
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.860
He was a dozer comes at you.
John went,
that's what you do.
Cool.

46
00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:44.430
I'll put you on your back foot.
You go first.
Not In my,
not in my night.

47
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.030
I'm going to go first.
He all done.
Anthony Smith was defensive the entire time.

48
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.640
He just took away all his tools.
He also fought very technically in the first,

49
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.390
first round.
It was,
he didn't just showing Adam Anthony.
Oh yeah.

50
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.780
For a very,
John actually in the first,
Sean got a little wild.

51
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.570
I felt like he almost felt the pressure of being a,
you know,

52
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.530
minus 800 favorite really since never seen John thrilled those wild punches that

53
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:11.050
first round.
He was trying to get him out of there and they went,
you know what?

54
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:15.550
This isn't gonna be as easy.
I thought recalculate and then dismantle them.
Yeah.

55
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:19.720
I mean,
he's the best of all time by far,
by far the best.
But who who,

56
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.570
who in that division can fuck with him now?

57
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.410
I mean [inaudible] which is,
look,
Santos is a wildcard.

58
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.050
That motherfucker can knock out anybody.

59
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:32.480
I would have liked to see Johnny Walker not below his shoulder out.
Celebrate.

60
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.590
And it's fine though.
What's listen man,
he couldn't move his arm.

61
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:38.980
He came in the back and they'd even,
they're waiting to,
I think today,

62
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.570
but in the back after he went.
I'm actually good now.
Okay,
so what that must mean.

63
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.260
That must mean that he dislocated it and then they popped it back in place.

64
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.060
So it could be fine or there could be some significant tearing inside that

65
00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:54.610
allowed it to dislocate.
And that can be a problem in the future.

66
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.460
Say it's fine though,
but it's home,
but still not fighting John Jones yet.

67
00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:00.010
He hasn't wasted.
Fill that dude up.
Stem cells.

68
00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:04.470
Just get a bunch of needles in there and fucking Corazon do all the fucking,
no,

69
00:04:04.471 --> 00:04:06.430
no warm Schwann,
bro.
Don't know.

70
00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:09.020
Give them cortisones to give them some stem cells.
So it toast.

71
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.770
Santos is the interesting fight for John.
Yes.

72
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.780
He's interesting because Santos throws fucking nuclear muscles at your head and

73
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:18.780
you know,
he did stop.
Jimmy knew Mattawa he's,

74
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.760
he stopped several guys at light heavyweight.
He looks spectacular,

75
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:22.450
light every way,

76
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.610
and he stopped Anthony Smith and their last fight at middleweight.
