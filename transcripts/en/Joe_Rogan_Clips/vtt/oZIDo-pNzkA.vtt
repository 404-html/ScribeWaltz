1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.740
Threat going on at the same time.

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.740
I want to bring you back to something you said earlier that you sort of glossed

3
00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:07.780
over,
but you were talking about quantum physicists,
right?

4
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.450
Getting everything wrong.
So I flew to Moscow.

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.050
No,
and I've debunked that.
And a book called the God problem.

6
00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:20.490
How I godless cosmos creates that has five Harris's and heresy.

7
00:00:20.491 --> 00:00:24.190
Number one is that one,
is that a a does not equal a,

8
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.710
that's Aristotle's primary law of identity.
No,
it's not always true.

9
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.330
Um,
one of the laws is the theory of entropy is so fucking wrong.

10
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.920
Entering means that all everything is falling apart constantly.

11
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.410
And that in order to make something positive happen,

12
00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:45.270
you have to shed more negative energy,
not really negative energy,
more dispersed,

13
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.500
waste energy.
And in fact the universe doesn't work like that.

14
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.250
The universe in the very beginning at formed quarks from,

15
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.320
from nothing but motion quarks for emotion.
Are you kidding me?

16
00:00:58.321 --> 00:01:03.150
Yeah.
The first things from movement,
are you joshing?
No.

17
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.300
And then the quarks had to get together in groups of three because this is a

18
00:01:06.301 --> 00:01:08.790
profoundly social universal,
they couldn't survive.

19
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.710
And one form of Cork like this with one up and two down or something like that

20
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.770
is a neutron and the other direction,

21
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.040
three quarks is a proton and all of this is anti entropic.

22
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.570
And then what do all of these billiard balls do?
What are all these particles do?

23
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.790
380,000 years later,

24
00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:34.440
they begin sweet themselves together in these massive social agglomerations that

25
00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:39.130
look like big potatoes and those are the beginnings of galaxies before they form

26
00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:43.890
their spiral arms and stuff like that.
Uh,
and then within the,

27
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.590
the spiral arms of these galaxies,

28
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.880
gravity balls are competing with each other to see who's the biggest gravity

29
00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:53.670
ball and the biggest wins and what does he do to the losers?

30
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.770
He swallows them and gets even bigger,

31
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.430
which makes it possible for that gravity ball to confront another bunch of

32
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:02.340
gravity balls and beat them out for size and swallow them.

33
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.820
Eventually what happens is you get so much gravity and so much matter in this

34
00:02:08.071 --> 00:02:12.390
gravity ball that the gravity ball explodes.
That's called a son a star.

35
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.460
And around it are smaller gravity balls that managed to hold their own in

36
00:02:17.461 --> 00:02:20.400
competitions and their planets and moons.

37
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.530
How the hell do you go?

38
00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:26.940
Even this short distance into the life of galaxy that's been around for 13.7

39
00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:30.540
billion years with precisely the opposite of entropy happening.

40
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.620
What is the official definition of venture be?

41
00:02:32.621 --> 00:02:36.270
How's it defined by Webster's dictionary?
Do you know?

42
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.350
It's usually a weasel definition weasel.
Yeah.
In other words,

43
00:02:40.351 --> 00:02:45.060
it's deliberately obscure.
Ah,
because it's such a weird subject.
Yeah.
Um,

44
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.110
that's funny.
But every priesthood has a shibboleth.

45
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.960
A shibboleth is a magic word.
If you can't pronounce it,
you're dead.
Ah.

46
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.130
And so every tribe wants you to believe in something that's impossible.

47
00:02:58.831 --> 00:03:01.780
Remember,
red queen or the White Queen in Alice in Wonderland said,

48
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:06.040
sometimes I dream up six impossible things before breakfast.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

49
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.730
And you have to pass the test by showing that you believe in something that's

50
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.030
obviously fatuously wrong.
And that's the,

51
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.190
and the Shibboleth for being considered a legitimate scientist is preaching

52
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.930
allegiance to pledging allegiance to entropy.
Pull it up.

53
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.040
Let me see what it says here.

54
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.640
<v 1>It says a,</v>

55
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.740
a measure of the unavailable energy and a closed thermodynamic system that is

56
00:03:31.621 --> 00:03:36.621
also usually considered to be a measure of the systems disorder that is a

57
00:03:37.891 --> 00:03:40.140
property of this system state.

58
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.100
And that varies directly with any reversible change in heat in the system and

59
00:03:47.071 --> 00:03:50.850
inversely with the temperature of the system broadly,

60
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.630
the degree of disorder or uncertainty in the system.

61
00:03:54.631 --> 00:03:58.230
So that's what they're saying is the degree of disorder or uncertainty in the

62
00:03:58.231 --> 00:03:59.064
system.

63
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.510
<v 0>Obviously that's a very lucid explanation and you could recite it to a five year</v>

64
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:08.480
old and need to understand exactly what you were saying or too easily.

65
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.180
It is a little reason.
It's very weasley.
It has lots of outs.

66
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.120
So my book,
the God problem,

67
00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:19.630
how a godless cosmos creates debunks that along with a bunch of other

68
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:23.740
assumptions and current side is that assumption exists.

69
00:04:23.741 --> 00:04:28.741
He believed because in the 19th century when this was formulated,

70
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.950
um,
the metaphor of the day was the steam engine.

71
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.750
It was the hot new technology.
It was to the 19th century,
what computers are due,

72
00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:42.370
the 22nd century or whatever we're living in now.
Uh,
the 21st century,
sorry.

73
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.650
And um,

74
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.440
so what they realized was you take this steam and you push it into a piston and

75
00:04:51.731 --> 00:04:56.470
it throws that piston up into the air and then the piston comes back down again

76
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.420
but then there's waste.

77
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.930
The steam then has lost its energy and it comes out of an exhaust valve and you

78
00:05:04.211 --> 00:05:07.180
put in more hot steam.
Right.
Um,

79
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:13.170
so this was a theory about the waste that comes out of the steam engine.

80
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.760
But now that we don't have,
I mean cars,
yes,
they produce exhaust.

81
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.080
Now would you say that um,

82
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.850
solar power and solar power does not produce exhaust.

83
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.740
So where's the entropy?
Right,
but where's the entropy?

84
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:28.880
Let's story of the universe.

85
00:05:28.881 --> 00:05:33.430
I was telling you aggregation of the batteries because I mean they are all yes

86
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.980
that that could be but it's a,

87
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.820
it's a square edge compared to the construction of a song.

88
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.210
It's a squid compared to the construction of a galaxy and all that random stuff

89
00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:49.660
in the universe.
All those random particles,
first of all they're not random.

90
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.700
They all participate in something.

91
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.960
The universe rings like a Gong and its early days.
It has pressure waves.

92
00:05:55.961 --> 00:06:00.961
That means that these elementary particles are scooching together and forming a

93
00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:03.200
wave.
Is that a technical term?
Yes.

94
00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:08.430
And then they're squinching apart and they're forming a trough and then there

95
00:06:08.431 --> 00:06:11.810
are scorching together again.
And that wave ripples across the cosmos.

96
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.110
The way that you see waves rippling across the Pacific when you're flying to

97
00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:19.490
Hawaii,
um,
is that entropic,

98
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.490
is that disorder constantly increasing?
Now it's the very opposite.

99
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:25.810
What the universe stars.

100
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.510
It takes every form of waste and turns it into an opportunity.
It,

101
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.340
I mean what we call this place earth,
what are we naming it for?

102
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.880
The Excreta of warms the shit of worms because they produced what we call soil.

103
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.980
Well think of the meaning of that word.
Soil.
When something is soiled,

104
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.840
what does it like?
It's not covered with earthy loam.

105
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.040
It's dirty.
Um,
so,

106
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.740
and we call it dirt when it's in the earth.

107
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.490
So we are taking this and tropic stuff,

108
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.380
the shit that came out of worms and we're farming in it and plants are growing

109
00:07:06.381 --> 00:07:10.280
and it trees are growing in it.
Flowers are growing in it.
Is that entropy,

110
00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:14.540
is that a continual slide toward disorder?
It's the very opposite.

111
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:19.100
It's a continual slide toward order and higher degrees of form.

112
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.660
How is this theory been received?
Um,
well,

113
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.980
uh,
or your interpretation of it?
That's a good question because,

114
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.820
um,
I really have no answer.
Um,

115
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.370
the people who I sent the book to in the early days,

116
00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:39.371
all of them except well including a Nobel prize winner and I think three

117
00:07:39.651 --> 00:07:44.651
MacArthur genius award winners all said this is a great book and one compared it

118
00:07:45.441 --> 00:07:49.370
to have Charles Lyles history of the earth,

119
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:54.610
which gave Darwin a lot of ideas and to Darwin's origin of the species and

120
00:07:54.981 --> 00:07:58.910
asked,
is this really a great book?
Like those two books?
And the answer has been,

121
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.840
yes,
this is the Lucifer principle.
No,
this is the God problem who I,

122
00:08:02.841 --> 00:08:04.190
godless cosmos creates.
