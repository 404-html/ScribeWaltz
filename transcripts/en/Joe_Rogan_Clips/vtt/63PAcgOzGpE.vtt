00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.800
I was going through Instagram the other day and there was this one person who

2
00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:09.360
was talking about the purpose of life and when you die,

3
00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:13.800
what's going to happen?
And uh,
I immediately just started laughing.
I'm like,

4
00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:17.910
you don't know how he's saying this.
Like when you die,

5
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.360
what happens?
And he was like,
when,
um,
spiritual type characters,

6
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.100
just kind of a huckster is a lot of spiritual hucksters out there these days.

7
00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:28.830
There are,
yes.
The,
in the 90s we debunked all of those.

8
00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:31.280
The psychics talking to the dead.
That was,
uh,
that,

9
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.050
that hasn't been too popular in recent years.
But that was a big thing.

10
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.850
People caught onto that little earpiece thing.

11
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.340
The earpiece or just the cold reading.

12
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.710
I see a father figure as this a grandfather,
father,
uncle,

13
00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:48.330
friend of the family,
you know,
you can and he's saying something about,
um,

14
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.650
you know,
it's okay for you to forgive yourself.
Oh,
okay.
Like,

15
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.610
well where was the,
will he hid his will somewhere?
Where is that?

16
00:00:56.611 --> 00:00:59.420
Cause that's what we want to know is you know that that ring he had.

17
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.360
Whereas if you're just vague enough,
I mean like a horoscopes,

18
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.560
if you're just vague enough,
people are like,
oh my God,
it's right all the time.

19
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.680
It's always right.
Like that's not even a real horoscope.

20
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.520
If you really want to pay attention to actual astrology that you,

21
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.740
they have to know the date you were born,
that time you were born.

22
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.890
It's not just the month of August.
You know,
it's like they got a,

23
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.440
they want to know morning or evening.
We think about all that stuff.

24
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.030
It's all bunk.
It,
yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
Why has it been around so long?
Uh,

25
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.930
well because the,
well it's called a Barnum effect where,
you know,

26
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.480
PT Barnum you just offer something for everybody.

27
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.780
So if you make it general enough,
you know,
I,
I sent you are an intelligent,

28
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.590
wise person that people really enjoy your company and,

29
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.560
and you like going to parties and be with other people and yet you liked the

30
00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:49.590
quiet solitude of a walk on the beach.
You know when people go on.
Yep.

31
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.610
That is so me,
I've pretty much described every scenario.

32
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.410
You can have your alone,
you're with people.

33
00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.960
But it's one of those things where if you talk to someone who is an actual

34
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:05.400
believer in astrology,
like they,
they are so convinced.

35
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.820
I got a friend of mine who was trying to tell me that he makes all of his

36
00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:13.110
decisions based on consulting with his astrologer.
Well,
Reagan,

37
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.030
Nancy Reagan for his travel after he was shot,
she got real paranoid about that.

38
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.890
Well,
so part of the problem is the astrologers and psychics are themselves

39
00:02:22.891 --> 00:02:25.670
remembering their hits and forgetting their misses,
the confirmation mining.

40
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.690
So I knew a psychic or a magician who was working the psychic friends network,

41
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.530
um,
it back in the 90s when it's hard,

42
00:02:34.531 --> 00:02:36.810
it's hard to make a living as a magician doing kids' parties.

43
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:39.510
They all want to have their own Vegas show.
But only a few people get that.

44
00:02:39.511 --> 00:02:40.950
So you got to do something on the side.

45
00:02:40.951 --> 00:02:45.480
So this guy was doing psychic friends network and uh,
he told me all about it.

46
00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:47.230
They gave him a book,
a three ring binder,
and you know,

47
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.220
here's the kinds of things you should say.
And you know,

48
00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:53.250
people are calling for love,
health,
money,
career questions.

49
00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:57.690
So you can spend 2030 minutes at 385 a minute just going through there.
You know,

50
00:02:57.691 --> 00:03:00.940
I sent you in a relationship right now and one of these more committed than the

51
00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:03.480
other.
Tell me about that.
10 minutes later,
you know,

52
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.100
they're still talking and you're thinking about travel,

53
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:07.360
you're not happy with your job.

54
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.470
There's some financial stress in your life right now.
And a,

55
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.680
and then he told me about stuff like now go get a crystal and then a candle.

56
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:18.430
I want you to set it up here on your desk.
And this would go on and on for hours.

57
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.650
And they charge by the hour and they charge by the hour.

58
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:23.830
So one of the problems that psychic friend networks had was people were not

59
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:25.560
paying their phone bills because they,
you know,

60
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.570
come back on $800 phone first and they would just not pay it.

61
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.020
So the phone companies crackdown on the psychic friends network company going,

62
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:35.110
hey,
this is getting out of hand that people aren't paying their bills.

63
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.860
So they had to ratchet it back a little bit.
This right.

64
00:03:38.861 --> 00:03:41.530
They would do it through the phone.
That's interesting.
Yeah.

65
00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:43.000
They wouldn't get a credit card from you.

66
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:44.830
They would just stay on the line with you.
Right.

67
00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:49.580
So he told me that when he first started,
he got like 60 cents on the minute,
uh,

68
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.510
for the three 95 at that per minute.

69
00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:56.680
But then they bumped it up as he got more experience and kept him on the line

70
00:03:56.681 --> 00:03:59.470
longer.
They give them bonuses.
Now you get a dollar per minute.

71
00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:03.490
And whenever I'm not illegal,
I mean he's not even a psychic and she didn't,

72
00:04:03.491 --> 00:04:05.140
you have to like,
if you want to be a doctor,

73
00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:08.290
you have to go and you've got to go to medical school.
We've got to get a degree.

74
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:09.310
It shouldn't.

75
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.580
There's a interesting history there because in New York City for example,

76
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.540
it was difficult to outlaw like the three card Monte guys on the sidewalk with

77
00:04:16.541 --> 00:04:20.070
the cardboard because it's just kind of a game right now.

78
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.150
Now it would be illegal to sell fraudulent stocks or something like that or sell

79
00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:28.900
a product that's advertised as a health product when it's not.

80
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.900
But if say in that case it's under food rather than drugs or say no health

81
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:35.494
products,

82
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.880
like a vitamin or under different standards than say medical drugs.

83
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.360
I'm a psychic is more like an entertainer.

84
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.270
So this is for entertainment purposes only.

85
00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:49.930
So we can do whatever we want as opposed to a medical doctor that's dispensing

86
00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:54.250
advice.
So
maybe doctors,
a bad example,

87
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.510
maybe I should've said engineer,

88
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.410
but the point is like if you're going to work as a psychic,

89
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.590
like on a psychic network,
if you have a business of selling psychics,
yeah.

90
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.800
Like you should be able to,
you have to exhibit some sort of psychic something.

91
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.400
Well,
they can't,
uh,
you know,
under controlled conditions they always fail.

92
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.440
There's nothing that's ever been done.
No,
no.

93
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.190
What about the one thing that I've read that,
uh,

94
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:22.010
statistically more people can recognize that people are staring at them?
Yeah.

95
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.510
Like when they're looking at you from behind said Horse Shit.
Well,
it's not been,

96
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.920
it's not been consistently replicated.
Um,

97
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.950
so is it possible that some people with a certain sensitivity can detect?
Well,

98
00:05:33.951 --> 00:05:37.990
we,
okay,
so one explanation,
the skeptics explanation is that if I'm in a,

99
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.110
say a Starbucks or something and I kind of have a sense that people are talking

100
00:05:41.111 --> 00:05:43.100
about may or may be looking at me and,
and,

101
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.380
and I look and that catches somebody's eye and they turned to me and I think,
oh,

102
00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:50.350
that person's looking at me or vice versa.

103
00:05:50.351 --> 00:05:53.000
I'm looking at them and then they send something or whatever.
He said,

104
00:05:53.001 --> 00:05:57.040
there could be some element of chance to that.
Now I'm the guy that does this,

105
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.820
Rupert Sheldrake.
Um,
you know,

106
00:05:58.821 --> 00:06:03.170
he believes that it's actually some kind of like a psychic power through the

107
00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:06.320
medium.
Like when I'm looking at you,

108
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:09.110
something's coming out of my eyes and tickling in your neck.

109
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.370
So this is morphic resonance,
morphic resonance.
Now,
Richard Wiseman,

110
00:06:13.371 --> 00:06:15.410
a British experimental psychologist,

111
00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:18.980
he's tried to replicate that and he always fails.
And then this other woman,

112
00:06:18.981 --> 00:06:19.691
Maryland Schlitz,

113
00:06:19.691 --> 00:06:22.970
she also tried to replicate it and she was able to replicate some of it.

114
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.820
So there may be an experimenter bias.

115
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.850
It's not clear if it's the skeptics that are biased or the believers that are

116
00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:33.170
biased.
But in that case,
it's best to just say,
you know,
we don't know it.

117
00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:34.730
So the default position,

118
00:06:34.731 --> 00:06:38.540
the null hypothesis is that it's not true until you prove otherwise.

119
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:43.220
And that's uh,
that's a difficult one to prove.
Now if they say,
if I say,
well,

120
00:06:43.221 --> 00:06:44.950
why is the effects so subtle?
Why can't you,

121
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.190
you go to Vegas and become a millionaire gambling or play the stock market.

122
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.860
You know,
we know traders just need a tiny,
you know,

123
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.080
one point 0.01% advantage over the other traders or whatever.

124
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.170
And they can make a lot of times it just psychic ability.
Yeah.

125
00:06:57.171 --> 00:06:59.210
So if the psychic ability is a very broad term,
right?

126
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:01.620
It's almost like saying drugs because like yeah,

127
00:07:01.621 --> 00:07:04.640
there are certain drugs that put you to sleep and certain drugs that make you

128
00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:06.590
hyper,
they are very different effects.

129
00:07:06.591 --> 00:07:09.950
So saying psychic ability like maybe have the ability to see if someone's

130
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:13.490
looking at you but you don't have the ability to pick the lottery.
Right.
Uh,

131
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.930
so the hard part in testing psych exist to pin down what exactly are you saying

132
00:07:17.931 --> 00:07:21.080
you could do and that that's where it gets pretty fuzzy.

133
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.990
So these like why is it legal for the phone?

134
00:07:23.991 --> 00:07:26.930
Psychics cause that you can't pin them down.
If somebody says,
look,

135
00:07:26.931 --> 00:07:29.510
I'm just giving relationship advice,
why is that illegal?

136
00:07:29.511 --> 00:07:33.800
If I say like the Tony Robbins Netflix documentary,
I'm not your guru,

137
00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:38.450
which is basically I am your guru.
He has that moment in this huge auditorium.

138
00:07:38.451 --> 00:07:42.560
There's like 3000 people there and he gets this woman up on stage and she's got

139
00:07:42.561 --> 00:07:45.710
relationship problems.
He says,
do you have your phone?
She goes,
yeah,

140
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.340
take out your phone and call him right now.
And she,

141
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:53.810
he talks her through dumping this guy onstage on the phone and he's at work or

142
00:07:53.811 --> 00:07:54.800
something and he's like,
what?

143
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.160
And then she hangs up and everybody's happy that she did this.

144
00:07:58.161 --> 00:08:01.670
Now is that a good thing or a bad thing?
I have no idea.

145
00:08:01.671 --> 00:08:05.840
It's great for show business,
but what have,
you know,
so how the fuck,

146
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:06.980
I mean that seems crazy.

147
00:08:06.981 --> 00:08:10.040
Like how do you know what kind of relationship they really have now?

148
00:08:10.041 --> 00:08:12.950
Somebody that talked to both of them,
right?
Wouldn't you somebody that,

149
00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:16.490
I brought this up at a,
at an event recently,
a party and somebody said,
oh,

150
00:08:16.491 --> 00:08:20.540
I know the backstory.
His staff had been working in the audience and they,

151
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:25.430
they knew all about her and the relationship and it was about to go sour anyway.

152
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.040
So we brought her up.
It's like,
okay,

153
00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:30.410
so this is the thing with you see the psychics on TV,

154
00:08:30.411 --> 00:08:33.140
there's a lot of stuff you don't see.
They work the audience,

155
00:08:33.141 --> 00:08:36.650
they know people fill out.
I like the psych,
the faith healers.

156
00:08:36.651 --> 00:08:40.190
They fill out prayer cards,
they put their name and address and their ailment.

157
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:41.530
And then,
you know,

158
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:44.690
the faith healers have a little earbud in there and they're listening to the

159
00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:47.830
person in the back reading,
okay,
here's the person they have,
you know,

160
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:52.070
clock coma or whatever,
and you hear him calling this out.
So,
uh,

161
00:08:52.071 --> 00:08:53.720
so there's a lot of that that we don't see.
