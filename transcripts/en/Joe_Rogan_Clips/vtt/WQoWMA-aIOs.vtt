Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.120
<v 1>I'm trying to think of how to say it.
Don't beat around the bush.
I know.</v>

3
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.350
I'm trying to think how to say it because there's these all these fucking

4
00:00:09.351 --> 00:00:11.660
different avenues.
There's some people that um,

5
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.180
they will maybe consider themselves all right cause they just love fucking

6
00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:15.680
trolling people.
Like how do I,

7
00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:18.890
how do I trigger someone with some crazy outrageous thing,
right.

8
00:00:18.891 --> 00:00:21.060
And it's like I get it.
Um,

9
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.560
but then there are people then that you can take it a whole different avenue

10
00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:25.850
where it's like knowing that,
that,

11
00:00:25.851 --> 00:00:28.820
that thing it is now white supremacy that pepe the frog.
It is.

12
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.100
And to the point where it fucking,

13
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.090
Hillary Clinton puts a thing on our website where she's like,

14
00:00:32.091 --> 00:00:36.090
this is a white supremacist symbol.
That's insane.
What is the frog?

15
00:00:36.091 --> 00:00:37.190
Remember pepe the frog get there.

16
00:00:37.191 --> 00:00:41.420
Like it is 100% of white supremacy on her website.
Yes.

17
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.780
<v 0>This was us because of the Donald Trump people were using that frog to troll</v>

18
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:48.510
online.
Overextending looked like an idiot.
Okay.
But here's,

19
00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:51.840
here's part of the problem when you're talking about people who troll online,

20
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.710
go back to when you were a young liberal and you thought that if I was doctor

21
00:00:55.711 --> 00:00:59.550
and I was making $3 million here,
of course I should be giving 70% in taxes.

22
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.470
You don't have that.

23
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.220
So you're looking at the people who do and as part of you is like give it away

24
00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:07.950
man.
You shouldn't.
You don't deserve it.
Give it away.

25
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.690
That same mentality exists with trolls.
They don't have anything going on.

26
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.660
They're fucking losers for the most part.
So what do they want to do?

27
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.340
They want to burn it all down.
They want the whole thing burned out.
Go Trump,

28
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.860
go try.
I won't.

29
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.990
The reason why they want to say go tropos cause they want this clearly maniacal

30
00:01:27.271 --> 00:01:31.290
person to just throw a fucking monkey wrench into the gears and watch the whole

31
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:33.990
system explode.
That's half of what they're doing.

32
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.400
They don't have a vested interest in it.
They're not,
they're not successful.

33
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.930
They're not happy.
They're not doing well.
I think their roles,

34
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.460
if you're talking about all Trump supporters,
I think part of that is true.

35
00:01:44.461 --> 00:01:47.280
I'm not talking about all anyway because I was talking about all Trump

36
00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:48.600
supporters.
I'm talking about trolls.

37
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.200
Those people with the green frog fucking with the crazy hair on their Twitter

38
00:01:52.201 --> 00:01:56.220
profile.
I mean there's a lot of them that if you go over their Twitter feed,

39
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.810
their online 13 hours a day shitting on people.
I mean that's,

40
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.080
that's it.
Some people do.
I've gone,
I looked to this,

41
00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:06.700
a few people that I follow and I don't follow them either.

42
00:02:06.701 --> 00:02:10.200
I just go to their pay to have them bookmarked and I'll go to their page like,

43
00:02:10.201 --> 00:02:11.440
look at this crazy asshole.

44
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.560
What's he been up to today and what have they been up to?

45
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.690
Just troll and liberals just going crazy and shitting on that Jake tapper guy.

46
00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:23.010
Boy,
that's fucking guy's Twitter feed is a mess.

47
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.930
Why?
Because he,
he fucking summon the ire of the trolls.

48
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.680
There's a lot of people out there that are disenfranchised and very upset and

49
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.580
unhappy and just can't wait to burn it down.

50
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.080
They just want to burn it all down.

51
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.730
They don't have any fucking stake in the game.
They want it to burn,

52
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.620
you know?
And then where,
where do we go from that?
You know,
people need love.
Okay,

53
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.980
so those people need to be too late.
It's too late.
They get shitty parents.

54
00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:51.780
They live in a shitty neighborhood.
Their job sucks.

55
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.440
They probably have poor genetics.
They're fucked.
They got shit handled.
Life.

56
00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.180
Kate Upton,
he was a handsome man.
He's,
he's a closet troll.
You don't even know.

57
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.160
Just Jamie is the opposite of control.

58
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.030
They're looking at Kate Upton and your beautiful tits and they're like,
fuck her.

59
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:10.390
Fuck everybody.
Burn it down.
Why can't I have this?

60
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.800
Oh Conor Mcgregor's got a limousine.
Light him on fire.
That's what they're doing.

61
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:18.910
They're mad,
they're not happy,
they're not successful,

62
00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:19.930
and they get to talk.

63
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.770
That's a big part of what you have in a society where people were being

64
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.320
incredibly mean at every opportunity.

65
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.490
But people have the opportunity to troll people have like,

66
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.860
did you see like some of the shit that people wrote to Patton Oswald after his

67
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:37.810
wife died?
No,
I didn't see anything crazy stuff.
Vicious mean Evil Shit.

68
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:40.800
And why do they do that?
Because they want to burn it down to one.

69
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.110
<v 1>I think it's part of it.
Part is going to be that they want to burn it down,</v>

70
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:45.310
but I think it's just also,

71
00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:47.980
there are a lot of people that don't have the concept of shit that we do online

72
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.250
having potentially horrible ramifications in the real world.

73
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.780
I think that slowly we're getting closer to that where it's all the fucking same

74
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:58.800
thing.
Um,
and if you do some crazy,
outlandish shit,
uh,

75
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.210
you should know that a ton of people might see it.

76
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.550
It's why it's one of my favorite things to screenshot and uh,
and,

77
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.740
and talk back to a few people that say stupid shit to me online just because

78
00:04:08.741 --> 00:04:11.260
it's like,
you think that you're saying it in this like tiny room,

79
00:04:11.261 --> 00:04:14.610
but the Internet's fucking everybody in a room.
Right?
You know,
everyone,

80
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.380
like what you say has ramifications.
Well not only that,

81
00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:20.800
you shouldn't want to say it,
so you have to get to the root of the problem.
Like,

82
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.680
why would someone want to be so evil?

83
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.730
Why would someone want to hurt someone's feelings so badly that you're mocking

84
00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:31.870
his?
I think there are a lot of people that just died.
So that's,
that's a fucking,

85
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.380
that's a horrible emotional example.
But when and why?
Right.

86
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.000
So what I would say separately from that,

87
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:39.770
if you're talking about trolling liberals or something like that,
um,

88
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.450
I think that there are people that,
and the,

89
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.900
the one that burned the whole thing down,

90
00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:47.140
and then I think there are some people that literally they have the mindset that

91
00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:49.930
it's just for laughs.
Right?
That's not him.
Yeah.
And so,

92
00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:54.490
and so it's one of those things where,
I don't know,

93
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:57.480
I don't think there was,
people are inherently evil.
I think that,
um,

94
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.860
especially if you're talking about like a Patton Oswald thing that's incredibly

95
00:04:59.861 --> 00:05:04.270
wrong and horrible.
Um,
but it's like,
Mike,
my question becomes like,
how do I,

96
00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:09.100
how do I talk to that person?
Right?
How do I not,
uh,
how do you talk to who?

97
00:05:09.101 --> 00:05:10.870
Patton Oswald,
the trolls,
the trolls.

98
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.800
When you got to go back in time to where the mother was raising them and take

99
00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:18.610
them away from the mom and bring them to a happy person and give him love and

100
00:05:18.611 --> 00:05:20.830
lots of hugs.
I think people,
as long as,

101
00:05:20.831 --> 00:05:23.740
as long as you don't automatically call someone the villain,

102
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.650
I think that you can get some people,
not all of them because some people,

103
00:05:26.651 --> 00:05:28.630
like you said,
they wanted like fucking throw a hand grenade,

104
00:05:28.631 --> 00:05:31.750
call them the villain and when they're a troll,
when they're evil.

105
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.460
Is that what you mean?
Yes.

106
00:05:33.461 --> 00:05:35.920
When they're maybe saying something they would see as evil things.

107
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.640
When I'm not talking about the patent Oswald situation because if you go after

108
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.910
someone grieving over their wife,
fucking horrible monster and hopefully you,

109
00:05:43.911 --> 00:05:48.160
you do understand that that has a real world ramifications or not.

110
00:05:48.161 --> 00:05:51.360
If you're just an egg,
you might be able to get away with it.
He just a little bit

111
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.250
<v 0>egg fuck face 69 on Twitter and you do,</v>

112
00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.230
you can get away with it.
They'll ban your account,
whatever.
Ha Ha.
Yeah,
I got 'em.

113
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.480
I mean,
that's what you're doing and trying to get a reaction.

114
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:05.270
It's like you're playing a game.
You're right,
you're playing operation.

115
00:06:05.271 --> 00:06:10.190
And when that tweezer hits the sides and cause like I saw it,

116
00:06:10.191 --> 00:06:12.670
it happened.
It was a thing.
Yeah,
it was a thing.

117
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.140
<v 2>Okay.</v>
