1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.320
Now,
let me,
let me pose this to you.
So I know a guy,

2
00:00:02.321 --> 00:00:05.260
he's a treasure hunter by trade.
Very cool old guy.
Australian guy,

3
00:00:05.261 --> 00:00:08.290
lived in Perth and uh,
for years he's like,

4
00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:11.950
I know where this certain Spanish ship went down.
Long story short,

5
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.060
he finds it right,
digs up one single gold coin and he's like,
it's here.

6
00:00:16.061 --> 00:00:19.210
I know it's here.
It's big spear fishermen.
Adventure guy goes,

7
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.430
spends tens of thousand of dollars is not a rich man,

8
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.550
spends tens of thousand dollars,
got gets all this excavator equipment,

9
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.850
goes to this very remote area of Northwestern Australia,

10
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.650
pulls up something like $10 million worth of treasure,
takes it home legally,

11
00:00:32.651 --> 00:00:35.920
declares it all.
Tells,
tells the government gets all compensated.

12
00:00:35.921 --> 00:00:37.240
They give him three or four pieces.

13
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.030
You can see his treasure in the museum in Perth.

14
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.090
Here's this guy who would've retired,
been a wealthy man,
you know,

15
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.340
had his whole life taken care of because of this thing he was obsessed with and

16
00:00:48.341 --> 00:00:52.260
then found and then got the tools on his own dime to go and get it declared it

17
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.370
has a confiscated to food.
Well,
that's where,

18
00:00:55.371 --> 00:00:58.380
because you find stuff in the ocean and they take it and people become

19
00:00:58.381 --> 00:00:59.430
billionaires.
Right.

20
00:00:59.431 --> 00:01:04.320
They find Russian or a Roman chair ships filled with gold coins.
Yeah.

21
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.490
But for whatever reason,

22
00:01:05.491 --> 00:01:09.480
like this was considered like a history historically valuable.

23
00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:14.330
So it was taken for the museum.
Right.
And he got,
yeah,
a few coins and no money.

24
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.990
I,
I gotta look up the guy's name.
I know a similar story.

25
00:01:17.991 --> 00:01:22.400
It's happened in America.
Okay.
Uh,
the guy that went to hunt it got investors.

26
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.600
Right.
And when he got the gold,
he just kept it.

27
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.350
When investors ask for the money,
he shorted said,

28
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.030
I don't know what you're talking about.
I lost it.

29
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.150
Or I don't know where I put it or I don't know where it is.
So He's,

30
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.110
I think he's currently in jail under contempt of court.
Oh Geez.

31
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.350
Being asked where is it?
And he said,
I don't know.

32
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.970
He's taking a lot of detector tests.

33
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.880
It people think because kids have it or something like that,

34
00:01:46.881 --> 00:01:50.570
but they have no idea where it is.
It's a crazy story.
Well,

35
00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:53.390
that's a weird one too,
because like what are you going to do with it?
Right?

36
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.510
Like if people are staring at you,
they're,
they're like constantly,
look,

37
00:01:56.511 --> 00:01:58.130
where is it?
Where is it?
You're like,
I don't have it.

38
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.730
They're going to keep looking like how much is it worth?
Millions.

39
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.180
I think each coin might be worth a million and you might have something like 20

40
00:02:05.181 --> 00:02:08.030
to 30 of them.
It's like a lot of money.
It's insane.
Well,

41
00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:11.180
you got to bring it to someone who's going to give you a piece.
You know?

42
00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:13.850
You got to bring it to someone,
but then you're going to get caught.

43
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.320
Where'd you get the 5 million bend?
What exactly the dental found it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

44
00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:21.260
What do you do?
Well,
it's interesting when things are historical,
right?

45
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.280
You don't know like who,
who does it belong to?
A museum.

46
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.980
Does it belong to the person who finds it?
Right?
Like what are the,

47
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:31.520
what are the rules and are we making these rules up as we go along?
It's,
yeah,

48
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.530
it's worth 20 million.
There's,
I'd found a story is still in jail right now.
Wow.

49
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.630
Jailed.
Treasure Hunter ordered to pay nearly 20 million.
This is Tommy Thompson.

50
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.160
Tommy Thompson's on it.
Yeah.
That sounds like the kind of guy.
