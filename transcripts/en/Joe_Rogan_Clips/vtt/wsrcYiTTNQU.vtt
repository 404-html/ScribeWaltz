1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.940
I agree.
So we'll just,
it was briefly,
then you jump in there.
Ready?

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.180
Let me tell you what my deep research and basically vision is.
Okay.

3
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.930
It just means you're things crystallize epiphany.

4
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.540
<v 1>Okay.</v>

5
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.860
<v 0>To to talk about 12 dimensions,
11 known,
12 being omnipresent.</v>

6
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.150
So we don't say it actually exists.

7
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.730
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.980
<v 0>To say that is arrogance.
So I won't say that,</v>

9
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.230
but I have had dreams my whole life that come true.

10
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.150
And the weirdest thing like,

11
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.620
Oh lady drops a thing of pickles at the store or for five years I have the dream

12
00:00:34.621 --> 00:00:37.980
and then one day I'm there and it's the woman in the pickles break or,

13
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:40.050
or I'll her corner.
When was this?

14
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:41.390
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

15
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.550
<v 0>chicken.
When I was a kid.
It was more intense ties.
Fucking crazy.
So you,</v>

16
00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:47.570
for five years he had the same dream that one day it happened.
Yes.

17
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.370
Was it exactly how you drempt ish.
Fuck.

18
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.790
For about six months I had a dream of a guy in a purple and green striped shirt

19
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.320
and I'm like,
why am I walking?
Cause it's not like normal dreams,

20
00:00:59.321 --> 00:01:01.570
just like you're been taken over.
You always get vomit.

21
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.100
Like a lucid dream was a dream and I'm walking around like Lala behind a

22
00:01:05.101 --> 00:01:09.750
building and all of a sudden there's some dude in a purple and green stripe

23
00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:12.300
shirt.
He attacks me and six months later

24
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.520
it happens.
And I mean it happens.
Exactly.
So what do you think is going on?

25
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.270
If you mean all thoughts of yourself aside,
just,

26
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.640
just look at it objectively.
What do you think that is?

27
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.860
You could say that it's human programming and basic programming in the brain.

28
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.100
Do you think you're tapping into a timeline that maybe you can't access all the

29
00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:35.620
time?
That's what I know of the reasons why you can rent.

30
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.120
One of the reasons why you can rant and rave and,

31
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.770
and when you spew out information that way you do,
which is at very impressive,

32
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.810
the way you can talk about the three hour straight and you do the majority of

33
00:01:46.811 --> 00:01:49.750
your programs entirely by yourself.
No telephone.
I agree with you.

34
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.660
It's not like I'm going to tell you a little bit is you,

35
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.120
you're doing something unusual.
Do you understand that?
Not even doing it.

36
00:01:55.121 --> 00:01:59.570
It's like a river's going by.
There's a turtle,
there's a fish,
there's a log.
I,

37
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.350
that's why it's like random like what does this,
what does that exactly right,

38
00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:03.580
but that's how you communicate.

39
00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:05.860
That's like in the beginning of the thing we were talking about Sandy Hook.

40
00:02:05.861 --> 00:02:07.870
I kept trying to slow you down.
I was like,

41
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.930
I'm not following you down this river and you just hit this one rock.

42
00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:13.090
I want to talk about this rock.
I want to talk about the next rock,

43
00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:16.150
but you just keep going the way you think about things this year.

44
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.930
You're chaining one thing to the next thing,
to the next thing,
to the next thing,

45
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.630
and for people who are not thinking the way you're thinking,

46
00:02:22.631 --> 00:02:26.680
it can be exhausting like you're trying to follow Sam right about it all.

47
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.320
I'm only shame that like the code,

48
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.200
but I'm wondering because of the fact you're telling me that you had these

49
00:02:32.201 --> 00:02:34.810
dreams that came true exactly the way you dreamt them.

50
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.200
I know you're not full of shit.
I've done.
You're not a liar.

51
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.140
I've known you for a long time.
If that really did happen to you,

52
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.920
if this is your real life experience,
I want to know what the fuck that is.

53
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.130
You are you,
are you on the periphery?

54
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.930
Do you have your finger on a membrane that maybe other people can't totally

55
00:02:52.931 --> 00:02:57.460
touch where occasionally just occasionally you get a little peek through and you

56
00:02:57.461 --> 00:03:00.460
get to see the other side,
even if it's once or twice in your life.

57
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.660
Who's to say that what you're experiencing by being able to see these things

58
00:03:04.661 --> 00:03:07.090
that manifest themselves realistically in the future,

59
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:11.200
that this isn't what human beings will have five years from now or a hundred

60
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:14.080
years from now?
Well,
sure,
exactly.
We think of like a cell phone.
Me,

61
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:16.930
magic arteries,
we think we're all the same.
That's the thing.

62
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.150
We think we're all the same.
We're not all the same.

63
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.190
We're not all the same in our ability to talk.

64
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.430
You can talk for a lot longer about [inaudible] and I do.

65
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.420
Eddie Bravo could talk about Jujitsu better than both of us.
And he's a musician.

66
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.150
Sorry.
You and I both suck at music,
right?

67
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.290
So there's certain things that people can do that you can't let me try to

68
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:38.120
describe it and they'll use it against me,
but no to,

69
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.600
they don't touch it because just their whole religion and they can't stand.

70
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.780
I'm talking about it.
By the time I was like three years old,

71
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.250
I would have this dream that God has cause God knows everything is just super

72
00:03:49.251 --> 00:03:51.890
intelligent,
omnipresent,
unlimited dimensions.

73
00:03:51.891 --> 00:03:54.860
But God doesn't know where God came from.
She'll just like,

74
00:03:54.861 --> 00:03:56.540
we're trying to find out where we came from.

75
00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.720
God is like a virtual reality simulation as well.

76
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.940
And God is constantly running every program,
every operation,
turning evil,
loose,

77
00:04:04.941 --> 00:04:08.420
good Lucia,
everything show,
I would have these dreams

78
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.690
but earliest memories like two,

79
00:04:11.691 --> 00:04:16.280
three years old where I would fly out to the edge of infinity.
And

80
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.270
it was uh,
it was a continual message.
Find out where we came from,

81
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.080
find out what it is.
And it would just be this big giant spinning black vortex,

82
00:04:26.081 --> 00:04:26.920
like a black hole.

83
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.330
And then I would have to go into that trying to figure out what was going on.

84
00:04:31.331 --> 00:04:35.110
And it never,
it was the same thing.
And so it's this incredible frustration.

85
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.460
So then growing up and dealing with things in questioning politics and

86
00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:43.540
questioning all these other areas,
then having dreams that come true.
Exactly.

87
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.770
And like knowing what's going to happen before it happens and then questioning

88
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.730
and,
and that it never being wrong be like weird,

89
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.370
crazy stuff man.
Like,

90
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.690
like just so much tough where it becomes like you can't even deal with you.

91
00:04:57.691 --> 00:05:02.390
Like dial it out and then you just reached that point where

92
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.400
you don't even know what's real anymore because it's so crazy.

93
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.940
But then you see like the mathematics of the whole system and you know how it

94
00:05:10.941 --> 00:05:13.460
works.
It's not like you're some schizophrenia,
you talk about it,

95
00:05:13.461 --> 00:05:16.600
you deal with it and actually works.
Like now when you fight the system,

96
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.550
you automatically know what to do.
Like when you talk about something,

97
00:05:19.551 --> 00:05:23.210
the president word for word repeats me.
Trump is what freaks them out.

98
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.320
Word for word,
a whole speeches,
like whole things.
And I'm on a power trip.

99
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.050
That's what they flipped out about it,
the CIA and everywhere else.

100
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.550
And they were like,
well Jones is like connected to trumpet.

101
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.810
I think Trump's like an idiot savant.
What does that have to do with this speech?

102
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.390
Explain that Trump speech.
Um,
I'm trying to follow it.
I don't even know.

103
00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.800
I don't even know.
It's a thing.
It's hard to follow you sometimes because we,

104
00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:48.240
you're talking about God.
You were talking about Trump's Trump's,
well,

105
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.810
even before that he was talking about God.
Okay,
so God,

106
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.130
God knows everything except where God came from.

107
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.720
That's a good soundbite right there.

108
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.020
Do you think that God is just like every other system that we say like think of

109
00:06:05.841 --> 00:06:10.760
this.
There's no one odd is the motion.
No one yard.

110
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.010
There's no one bird that's running all the birds.

111
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.060
There's no one person that's running all the people.
There's the,
it's all chaos.

112
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:20.180
Even if we elect someone,
if they have the fucking people hate him,

113
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.350
everybody's in chaos.
There's con,
they're trying constant power struggle.

114
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.350
Do you think that God has decentralized?

115
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.140
Do you think that the idea of God is decentralized?

116
00:06:30.141 --> 00:06:33.110
That maybe God is a real thing,
but God's not one person?

117
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.430
God has literally three organisms.
God is not just freewill.
God,

118
00:06:37.431 --> 00:06:39.680
it's consciousness.
It's all of the organisms.

119
00:06:39.681 --> 00:06:42.250
It's every fucking technological innovation.

120
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.430
The God said new thing is a counterfeit.
Joe.
I agree.

121
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.720
Counterfeit.
No,
I'm saying I'm confident.
What's real?
Oh cause they all say,

122
00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:52.430
Oh God has everything that was going,
it was true.

123
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.970
God is experiencing consciousness or all of us.
There's there's,

124
00:06:55.971 --> 00:06:59.450
you know one of my,
where I have a hard time saying that I know this.

125
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.570
I could say God might be decentralized.

126
00:07:02.571 --> 00:07:05.630
I could say God might just be just like every other organism on the planet.

127
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.960
It's just some thing that's moving in a certain direction and trying to protect

128
00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:12.050
itself and trying to procreate and trying to advance and trying to innovate and

129
00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:14.690
trying to be better than it was yesterday.
That's when everything is doing,

130
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.990
every fucking animal that started out as a single celled organism is trying to

131
00:07:17.991 --> 00:07:20.930
survive because they create themselves.
Well,

132
00:07:20.931 --> 00:07:23.030
it's not necessarily that it didn't create itself.

133
00:07:23.031 --> 00:07:26.540
It's something created it slowly but surely and say this through the process of

134
00:07:26.541 --> 00:07:30.740
evolution and mutation.
This is the,
he'd go on,
we'll keep going for hours.

135
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.860
We should do an epic podcast.
But the point is we should not give up.

136
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.053
Let's don't give up.

137
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:40.060
The point is there is a pro human future and a pro freewill future and the

138
00:07:40.911 --> 00:07:44.540
globalist or,
or an anti human anti freewill future.

139
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.370
So all I know is just swim towards the light.
This is a good point,

140
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.200
zero human future.
