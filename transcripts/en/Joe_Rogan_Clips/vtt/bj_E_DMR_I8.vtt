1
00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.920
Her low freak bitches.
Yeah,
I worry about that constantly.

2
00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:08.540
I mean with the Oscar mix up last night,
I mean,
I heard about that,
see it,

3
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.940
but I heard about it.
I mean,
what did they mix up my eggs?
What's,
what happened?

4
00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:15.300
They said someone one and then it turned out to be someone,
Warren Beatty.

5
00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:17.280
They gave him an envelope.
Bless his heart.

6
00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:19.710
I can't and I'm so hard not read anymore.
No,
it's,

7
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:20.940
they gave him the wrong envelope.

8
00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:24.360
Warren Beatty has done nothing except be a classy legend.

9
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.020
She was just like the Steve Harvey thing.
Same thing,
same thing.

10
00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:32.580
All the memes are,
are uh,
the comparing them basically like,

11
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.310
you know,

12
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.740
Warren Beatty's and new Steve Harvey or Warren Beatty's of brilliant legend.

13
00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:41.480
And Steve Harvey is a silly talk show hosts.
Um,
but uh,
but yeah,
he,

14
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.330
he got the envelope for best actress and he's so,

15
00:00:45.331 --> 00:00:47.880
and he's just saw La la land and said best.
Uh,

16
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.800
and the entire cast of La la land went up on stage and then they had to go,
oh,

17
00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:54.120
actually it's moonlight.

18
00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:57.590
And then when the producers of La La land was a total class act and gentlemen

19
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.380
and was like,
Moonlight won,
and then moonlight had to come up.
It was math.

20
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.240
It was like the super bowl stress level.
I fucking hate those contests.

21
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.170
I don't have a dog in the game.
What was it?

22
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.300
What's the dog in the fight dog in the fight.
I don't have a dog in the fight,

23
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.370
but I hate those.

24
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.830
I hate award shows from there.
Seems so pretentious.
If you're not already won,

25
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.810
you have,
you've all won millions of dollars.
Movie Stars.
What is the,
well,

26
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:27.450
I think for me,
I mean especially with like the political climate,

27
00:01:27.451 --> 00:01:29.910
when people go and make political speeches,
it's like,
okay,

28
00:01:29.911 --> 00:01:33.780
how much did you donate this year?
Like what are you really do?
Like,
you know,

29
00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:36.420
just making all these speeches and talking to talk.

30
00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:40.380
I hope everyone's also walking the walk and you know,
authentic that way.

31
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.140
I don't know,
it's just,
it's so,
I mean I think loaded,

32
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.680
there's something anesthetic about it for people.
I think there's,

33
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:49.800
look at the silly monkey,

34
00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:53.880
like the diversion of dresses and necklaces and makeup and actresses.
You know,

35
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:54.571
I think humans,

36
00:01:54.571 --> 00:01:58.350
we have probably been an inherent need for that sort of diversion,
that sort of,

37
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.450
um,
uh,
vapid.
Let's talk about dresses instead of what's really going on.

38
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.840
And there's always a ribbon.
Does your,
that you're supposed to wear.
Yup.

39
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.710
What was the ribbon they had to wear last night?
Wasn't a blue,
what was it for

40
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.000
you?
I thought it was for the iceberg that was breaking off.

41
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.490
They're worried about that giant iceberg.
The size of Manhattan.
Fucking,
I know.

42
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.380
It's just,
it's just,
there's so many,
you know,

43
00:02:22.381 --> 00:02:25.860
and I just get frustrated sometimes.
I mean,
your,
your listeners are not the ones,

44
00:02:25.861 --> 00:02:29.550
cause your listeners seem to all be seekers.
Like who the fuck knows?

45
00:02:29.551 --> 00:02:31.440
It's like saying all girls or all boys,

46
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.600
I know my listeners or there's a bunch of men met Maggie.

47
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.620
One that listens to you is smart,
I think,

48
00:02:37.621 --> 00:02:42.060
or at least aspires to be.
I believe in you guys.

49
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.370
Where's Kendall Jones?
Who
thongs

50
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.930
should be lion hunting porn?
You shoot and you fuck right on top of this.

51
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.090
I feel like that would do well.
The guy,
Jesus,
someone very desensitized.

52
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.650
Um,
I mean that's what it's coming to level I guess these days.
Hashtag read it.

53
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.260
Um,
but yeah,
I'm sure it's humans have a need to uh,

54
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.930
just sort of disassociate with,
you know,
pictures of dresses.

55
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.780
Yeah,
I think there's definitely some of that.
Yeah,

56
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.170
there's definitely the pageantry people love when people dress up in all their

57
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:26.800
best and they walked real love watching people.
Oh yeah.

58
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.400
I'll try to keep it together.
Look at that fake clap.
Yeah.
Look,

59
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.590
oh she's not even happy for,
it's like,
well no matter what she does,

60
00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:35.300
you're going to project your shit onto this.
But you know what I do?

61
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.590
I do secretly not so secretly enjoy what I do.

62
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.430
Enjoy watching people as they get older who are clearly fucking crazy.

63
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.600
Keep it together.
Less and less.

64
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.090
Nicole Kidman was crapping like the Grinch last night clubs.
Yes.

65
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.770
She was clapping.
Yeah.
I mean,
I don't know what that is.

66
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.010
I don't clap a lot cause we're comics.
We don't go to shows.
I don't even know it.

67
00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.590
Clap.
Well,
uh,
you have to clap if you have a daughter that's in a play.

68
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.150
Oh,
constantly.
But are you all just filming the whole time?
No,

69
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.590
I clap my wife films.
Yeah.
A clap.
Yeah.
I don't like,

70
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.160
I'm not a good clapper either.
I do it after sac clap when you got a job.

71
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.510
Yay.
Hounded out.
Look at her.
Look at it.
No Way.
Look at this.

72
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.890
She also has,
she's comically Willoway.
I mean,
she does.

73
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.190
Her nails went,
I don't know.
I don't know.

74
00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:29.880
There's something crazy going carpal tunnel.
She,

75
00:04:29.881 --> 00:04:33.580
she's pulling her hands way back.
That's not,
she's doing too much.
Be crumb.

76
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.230
That's not good for your joints.

77
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>
