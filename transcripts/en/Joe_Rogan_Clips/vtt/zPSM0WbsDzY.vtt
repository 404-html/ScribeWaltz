1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.900
Hello Freak bitches.
Oh yeah,
definitely got a consequence champ.

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.510
Hottovy how about your boy?
Johnny Hendricks was like,
I figured it out.
I'm good.

3
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.890
Andrew Jackson's.
Let me try this out.
[inaudible] son.

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.100
Yeah,
he fought the fucking eraser.
Dude.
That guy's scary.

5
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.960
Even Post Usada scary up hold up race or listen to me right now.

6
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.350
That golden snitches.
Good.
You better.
I don't know what,

7
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.830
although did all these years being figured out,
we got to figure it out.

8
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.700
I looked at his body,
I thought,
what the fuck did he so jack,

9
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.740
he's jacked in shape.
Goodluck might be the best looking dude in the UFC.
Yes,

10
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.810
we can do it on the planet.
He's right.
He's right.

11
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.520
I didn't want to come off as gay when his shirt off in particular,
that's not,

12
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.570
you can get pictures too aggressive there.

13
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.040
Well they're doing the post fight showdown.
I'm like,

14
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.430
I bet he slangs all the ring card girls if you want it to.
As he was talking,

15
00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:56.040
I'm like,
this dude is just slaying dick out.

16
00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:59.020
Look at it right there when he was standing next to John Shit or sent the way.

17
00:00:59.021 --> 00:01:02.340
And so I was like,
no Johnny,
I'm not a middle weight.
This is,

18
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.300
this is a metal weight.
This is a big middle man.

19
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.390
He's so look how much bigger he is in Johnny.
I mean,
and she's Schrag Shush.

20
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.870
And the fight was basically an assault.
It was an assault.

21
00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:16.800
You would never believe that Johnny Hendricks was a former world champion of you

22
00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:19.560
saw the way the eraser beat the shit out of him.
I mean,

23
00:01:19.561 --> 00:01:23.340
he just beat the shit out of him.
Johnny fire back.
I mean,
he's tough.

24
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.800
He tried through some leg kicks,
threw some punches,

25
00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:30.720
but he was just getting fucking destroyed and just walked down and smashed,

26
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.640
kick to the body over and over again.
He was wincing after the first kick.
I know,

27
00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:37.050
man.
His second kick to the body,

28
00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:40.560
he got hit with you see him wincing and here is when he clipped Johnny
Hendricks.

29
00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:45.150
I mean it was no contest.
Unfortunately for Johnny and out of the White,
if you,

30
00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:47.000
if you weren't a famous linkedin,
they're like,
oh he got,

31
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:50.330
he got out of the crowd to fight this dime piece.
Like look at that,
right?

32
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.120
Oh this guy who likes to drink bears fighting this diet piece,

33
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.130
Brazilian well might be the best league in Brazilian of all time.
By the way,

34
00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.000
Johnny is just not the same guy.
He's just not the same guy.

35
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:03.750
And you could speculate all day.
There's reasons why,
you know what I'm saying?

36
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.590
Like I think sometimes people hate on guys for what they've done lately,

37
00:02:07.591 --> 00:02:10.590
but for Johnny Hendricks,
I mean you've had a great career brother.

38
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.250
It's just hard,
a great career.

39
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.600
But watching in a weight class above I agree should be,

40
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.770
I agree cause he doesn't want to watch his diet.
I think it's a number of things.

41
00:02:19.771 --> 00:02:22.620
But you know,
I just,
man,
there's nothing to hang your head on.

42
00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:26.820
You got to your world champion man.
You know a lot of people think you beat GSP.

43
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.280
Like you've had a great fucking career man.
A lot of people.

44
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.080
And now a good argument to that could really,
you could really have a real,

45
00:02:34.081 --> 00:02:36.720
I mean if you were just objective,
he didn't have a dog in the fight,

46
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.830
you could have a real interesting conversation about who won that function

47
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.870
argument there.
And I,
and I think if you're John and you know,

48
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:46.350
and he's probably taking a lot abuse online and I wish you would stop,

49
00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:49.740
but it's all good man.
You've had a good go.
I hope he doesn't take abuse.

50
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.120
Really what we should do,
we should be praising heaps on Paulo Kosta.
Cause that,

51
00:02:54.121 --> 00:02:58.410
that guy's scary.
He's fucking terrifying.
That guy's the future.
He's,

52
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.110
he's a legit fuck around.
But yeah.
Well who knows.

53
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.010
I and I would like to see someone test him.
I'd like to see him again.

54
00:03:05.011 --> 00:03:07.720
So like a real strong hundred 85 pound wrestler.

55
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.010
He's four known Yosia and all knockouts or three and all knocked out his last

56
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:16.540
two.
He merch dude.
So what we got to see his,
he's for real and he's the future.

57
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.040
How's he now on the cover of Gq or some shit?
I'm telling you,
man,
I'm fucking,

58
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:23.240
when I was watching,
I was like,
fuck.

59
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.190
Well that could be the one thing that doesn't man Weinstein next to him.
I mean,

60
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.140
good looking dude,
man.
Maybe that could be,
what does a man,
he just,
Oh,

61
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:35.680
just young pussy.
When you're that good looking,
it's probably,
it's gotta be hard.

62
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.220
It's got to be hard to say no super hard and as he gets more and more famous,

63
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.370
you know he's going to be famous.
For sure.
For sure.
For sure.

64
00:03:42.371 --> 00:03:45.760
It keeps smashing people that way.
Looking that way.
Smashing people that way.

65
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.120
That's trial.
Both son,
if he's not famous,
he should sue the UFC.

66
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.240
You'll look at this,
this shit.
Fuck him on the front.

67
00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:58.480
Cover the WII video game for Guthy.
Useless fucks.

68
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.580
It just,
Johnny looked two weight classes lighter than him.

69
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.210
Johnny looked like he was a welter weight and the eraser looked like he was a

70
00:04:07.211 --> 00:04:10.200
light.
Have Johnny's just lost men and like going to Jackson's.

71
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.920
I'm not knocking Jackson Jackson,

72
00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:13.540
one of the greatest capital all the time still is.

73
00:04:13.541 --> 00:04:17.290
But when fighters go there because they've seen how much success they've had,

74
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.950
it's literally heaven's waiting room.
It's,
it's the fucking,
you know,

75
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.160
it's the Florida of fighting cancer.
The cancer.
Yeah,
here's the solution.

76
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.250
But if you're going,
that's probably not the answer.

77
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.490
What's also got to think of the years that he wasn't there and those play a

78
00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:31.690
factor in its development.

79
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:34.660
It's not like you just get right back to where he should have been like,
oh,

80
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:37.990
here's the answer.
No,
you're,
we're training wrong for all these years.

81
00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:42.820
And its performance dwindled pretty substantially except for the one fight with

82
00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:45.040
Hector Lombard that's,
which is really interesting.

83
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.870
That was like the one fight where he actually looked pretty good.
Yeah,
he did.

84
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.880
And he beat Lombard,
who's still fucking dangerous.
And I was like,
well,

85
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.470
Johnny Hendricks,
who's like,
he's back.
And that wasn't that long ago.
Hell no,

86
00:04:57.471 --> 00:05:01.870
it was last year.
But there's another guy who shouldn't be at 185 pounds.

87
00:05:01.871 --> 00:05:03.880
So he fought a guy who's like him,

88
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.110
a thick dude who's really a one 70 that doesn't have the best diet in the world.

89
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.750
You know,
and I don't care what anybody says,

90
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.630
you know that you shouldn't be criticizing him.
He shouldn't,
you know,

91
00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:15.760
you don't walk a mile in his shoes and you know,

92
00:05:15.761 --> 00:05:19.570
maybe his body doesn't want to respond to cutting down to one 70 anymore.
Stop.

93
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.020
Just be honest.
And I'm a Johnny Hendrix Fan.
Look at his body.

94
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.050
You should not be fighting the best professional fighters in the world unless

95
00:05:28.601 --> 00:05:32.590
you're a heavyweight and you have a body like that with all that extra body fat

96
00:05:32.591 --> 00:05:35.800
that does you no good.
It's not aiding your performance in any way,
shape or form.

97
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.390
It is 100% a sign of a lack of either planning.

98
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.510
We didn't plan your died out in advance where you're too heavy or too much body

99
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:48.511
fat coming into camp or poor discipline or poor organization of your diet where

100
00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:52.090
you don't understand like what foods you should and shouldn't be eating.

101
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.890
When a guy's training for a three round fucking fight at the top of the heap in

102
00:05:56.891 --> 00:05:58.280
the UFC middleweight division,

103
00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.310
you've got to think this guy's got to be doing some goddamn rigorous shit.

104
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.290
The American public,
if they're watching this going,

105
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.030
if this fucking guy can't look good,
how am I going to look good?
And I'm not,

106
00:06:07.031 --> 00:06:09.110
I'm kind of exaggerating.
He's Johnny didn't look terrible,

107
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.450
but like I think it was worse cause holding look great coastal elite,

108
00:06:13.451 --> 00:06:14.990
like it didn't make it worse.
Statue.

109
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.570
And we don't all have to look like a bodybuilder with some of the toughest guys

110
00:06:17.571 --> 00:06:20.540
like Evan Dunham.
He doesn't have a bodybuilder physique,
but he's not,

111
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.190
he doesn't have any extra weight on them.

112
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.960
That extra weight is not doing you any good.
The boys not willing in any events,

113
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.410
you know,
bodybuilding event,
but he doesn't have a fucking extra pound on them.

114
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.540
You know northern is Woodley Willie's fucking shredded.

115
00:06:32.541 --> 00:06:35.330
He's got the best body in the division.
Woodley could wind Olympia,

116
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.360
he could when Mr Alleles top five just generally just got into it 100% he's got

117
00:06:40.521 --> 00:06:44.210
phenomenal genetics,
but anyway he's not,

118
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.360
you can't be competing at the highest levels of the sport given up that much of

119
00:06:49.791 --> 00:06:52.940
an advance.
Like if that was a good agreement that you had like all right,

120
00:06:52.941 --> 00:06:56.750
we could fight and one 85 but you have to be 20% body fat and I could be 10 like

121
00:06:56.751 --> 00:07:00.710
what?
Especially this day and age,
like mixed martial arts is such a high level.

122
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.100
I was just going over the,
the welterweights the other day and I'm like,

123
00:07:04.101 --> 00:07:06.190
Holy Shit,
Holy Shit.

124
00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.150
There's so much talent like the UFC in the welterweight division,

125
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:13.160
such good hands.
There's so much young killing talent.

126
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:18.350
If you're not taking every advantage of the the techniques and you're training

127
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.670
your had left in the dust and Jonny is from that old school kind of training.

128
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.400
You know what I'm saying?
Like he's an older cat man.

129
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:28.070
Well what he was talking about when he was talking about training in Texas that

130
00:07:28.071 --> 00:07:30.320
he couldn't spar hard with people or they wouldn't come back,

131
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.850
that he had to like take it light on them.

132
00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:33.520
And then what he really loved about going to Jackson's,

133
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.390
he was dealing with a real high level fighters all the time.

134
00:07:35.391 --> 00:07:39.170
So he's getting great training in,
which I fought,
was great to hear,

135
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:44.310
but it's not great that he spent so much time doing it the other way.
Well no,

136
00:07:44.311 --> 00:07:47.510
in 2017 you lose your,
you lose your focus,

137
00:07:47.511 --> 00:07:51.050
you lose the drive and you just start going through the motions if you're not

138
00:07:51.051 --> 00:07:52.550
being challenged all the time.

139
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.860
And he was obviously being challenged in competition,

140
00:07:54.861 --> 00:07:58.610
but he should have been with a real camp a long time ago.
The great,

141
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.020
what happened with him,
he had some,

142
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.060
he was with team take down and they had some sort of a dual degree,
ma'am.

143
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:08.210
So he was a team take down,
he came from Oklahoma state,
right,
national champion,

144
00:08:08.211 --> 00:08:11.360
whatever,
70 time,
all American,
just a monster.

145
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:15.440
And then the deal was is there going to support him financially with a house

146
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.820
food training camp.
They take care of all that.

147
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.050
They give you like a salary salary,
but once you make it work,

148
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:24.770
we're taking 50% of everything and when you're young up and coming hungry

149
00:08:24.771 --> 00:08:26.090
fighter like that's a great deal.

150
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.690
Until you become Johnny Hendricks and become the world champion,

151
00:08:29.691 --> 00:08:34.550
like hold up 50% I appreciate what you guys did for him to be like,
God damn man.

152
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.230
Like you're robbing me blind here.
This is crazy.
So he had to go separate ways.

153
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.990
Here's the question.
They open big rig steakhouse did Dave,

154
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.910
that was a terrible idea.
I would eat there though.
Did the,

155
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.920
I would eat there just for the story.
That should be getting selfie smile.

156
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.450
Hold off the menu,
but I'll hate on it if it wasn't good.
Johnny,

157
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:55.850
he's leave a Yelp review pro.
Have you ever Yelp reviews?
Never.
Have you ever.

158
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.660
That's why we're friends.
Have you ever,

159
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.110
have you ever blessed the comment on Youtube?
Nope.
Nope.
That's why we're friends.

160
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:09.310
Have you ever hated on a guy on Instagram?
I don't think so.
No,
me neither.
No,

161
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:13.740
not really.
My style.
No,
it's wasted time.
Yeah.
My friends don't do that.

162
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.520
I don't have any friends.
I don't get young.

163
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.140
Who the fuck you going to do is only so much time in this world?

164
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.560
You should use choose to use it wisely.
I was doing a mls,

165
00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:25.470
showed some guy asked me question,
stood up and just,
hey man,

166
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.400
have you read the Youtube comments?
I went,
stop.
There he was.

167
00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.650
I've never read a youtube comment on my lap.
My man,
so there's no quiet.
He goes,

168
00:09:31.651 --> 00:09:35.160
really?
Never went.
Not once.
I'm too busy creating material for you guys.

169
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:38.370
I'm not reading comments,
man.
He's like,
oh,
alright.
No doubt.

170
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.350
He's trying to rights.
He's trying to tell you something he wrote,

171
00:09:40.351 --> 00:09:43.800
so I'm sure she's really mean.
Probably probably trolling,
probably.

172
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:47.830
Maybe he felt that it was funny with it.
Hopefully not.
Um,

173
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.540
we're not hating on a garlic.
Johnny.
I love John.
Like I said,
there's,

174
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.600
there's no reason it is reality.
Right?

175
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:03.580
<v 1>Okay.</v>
