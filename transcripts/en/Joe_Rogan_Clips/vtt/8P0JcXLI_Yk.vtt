1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.630
You know,
I wanted,
how old's your son now?
He's six now.
And

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.770
you hear these,
uh,
stories,
um,

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.780
constantly about people remembering the first time they saw Bruce Lee movie.

4
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.980
It's so epic.
I'll never forget my dad took me to the theater,

5
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.470
blew my mind.
Everyone's got a story.
Joe,

6
00:00:19.471 --> 00:00:22.050
he's got his first time he saw Bruce Lee.

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.920
So I wanted to make sure I didn't do that too early because then he would
forget,

8
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.461
you know,

9
00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:30.540
cause he forgets special last moments we had together from like three years ago.

10
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:34.680
I'm like,
I don't remember that,
you know,
cause he's only five,
right,
man,

11
00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:35.940
he's six [inaudible] six.

12
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.620
Imagine how quick your brain is growing and out of money.

13
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.300
You forgot a lot of shit,
you know.
But anyways,
uh,

14
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.700
so I thought maybe I'm going to hit them with the,

15
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.760
I'm going to sit them down and,
and,
and put on,

16
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.260
enter the dragon and blow his fucking mind.
But I don't want to do a tour.
Like,

17
00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:52.831
when do I do it?

18
00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:56.610
I'm thinking maybe I could even wait until these 10 or eight or whatever,

19
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.340
you know?
But he's been doing karate since he was three,

20
00:00:59.341 --> 00:01:02.180
so about three years now he's been doing karate and he took a nun,

21
00:01:02.181 --> 00:01:05.970
chuck workshop class that they had.
So he's got his little,
you know,

22
00:01:05.971 --> 00:01:10.080
those padded nun chucks.
He fucking loves those things,
man.
And I thought,
shit,

23
00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:11.580
he's getting into the nun chucks.

24
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.070
It might be a time to drop Bruce Leon,
his ass.
You know what I mean?

25
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.010
I don't want him to get twisted,
you know what I mean?
Cause he starts,

26
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.940
he starts talking about Jackie Chan and shit like that.
And I'm like,
Oh,

27
00:01:23.941 --> 00:01:26.730
I guess you seen anybody do it on video or only learned it from,

28
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.120
this is what happened.
So He's,
he's all Linden and Chuck's,

29
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:34.080
he's beaten me up with them all the time.
He loves nunchucks and I,
and I said,
Oh,

30
00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:38.040
then I wore one of those routes of fights shirts and it was Bruce Lee with lunch

31
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:42.690
looks right.
And he looked at my shirt and he said,
Daddy,

32
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.400
who's the guy with the nun chucks?
And I thought,
okay,
it's time.

33
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.920
It's time,
son.
Sit down.
So,
you know,

34
00:01:52.921 --> 00:01:57.060
kids are so easily brainwashed.

35
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.410
I can get my kid into satanism.
I've seen this little kid.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's amazing.

36
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.920
He's amazing.
He's got the Bruce Lee outfit and everything.
The jumpsuit.

37
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.670
This is amazing.
And he's got,
he's got,
uh,

38
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:10.320
the game of death sequence down.

39
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.980
It says the video is my son and in parentheses,

40
00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:18.720
a five year old acting Bruce Lee's nunchucks scene.

41
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.990
Yeah.
Yeah.
He ran acts the whole thing.
No for not,

42
00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:25.020
I think he was on like America's got talent or some shit too.

43
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.230
So I sat him down and I,
and I explained to him,

44
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:32.970
I go the master of the nun chucks the number one guy,
you know,

45
00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:35.850
cause like,
like I was,
like I was saying earlier,

46
00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:38.670
you can get kids to believe in anything.
You get brain.
I could,

47
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.560
I could get my son into Satan easily.
He'd be all in all about Lucifer.
Boom.

48
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.600
I got them under the Brown.
Yeah.
Little kids,
you know.
Yeah,
totally.

49
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.900
He's,
he's so into the Dodgers because his grandpa is under the daughter,

50
00:02:52.901 --> 00:02:56.280
so he's all about the Dodgers and I got them into the browns.

51
00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:59.650
He's all in the Brown's not too,
because then I could get them into,
right.

52
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.440
So I sat him down and I say,
you are about,

53
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.130
I'm going to sit you down and I'm going to show you the master of the nunchucks.

54
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:08.740
And it's Bruce Lee.
He's number one dude.

55
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.580
He's decry,
right?

56
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.820
He's the greatest martial artist of all time.

57
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.500
I broke them and I sat him down and put them in front of the TV to,

58
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:23.170
they should have filmed this.
I did you fill the whole thing?

59
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.250
He filmed you saying it to him?
No,
I didn't film that,
but I filmed it.

60
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.940
I filmed him watching Bruce Lee.
Um,
uh,

61
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.290
first I showed him the greatest nunchuck scenes of all time with boost lead that

62
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:38.230
you can go to youtube and you can get theirs.
There's compilations.

63
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.750
They put together the one from this stuff in enter the dragon and the stuff in a

64
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.860
Chinese connection,
uh,
uh,
way of the dragon or return of the Dragon.

65
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.610
And uh,
so I sat him down and go,
I'm going to blitz them with this shit.

66
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.360
I'm going to make sure that whenever he thinks about fucking nunchucks,

67
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.590
he knows that Bruce Lee's the master,
right?
So he's just completely blown away.

68
00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:01.780
Then after I showed him all the nunchucks scenes,

69
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.380
I sat them down and I want him to show him the greatest fight scene of all time.

70
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.850
Bruce Lee versus Chuck fucking Norris.
Come on man.

71
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.390
So I just wanted her to leave that just in his DNA.
And I filmed that.

72
00:04:13.391 --> 00:04:16.480
I filmed him watching a chuck Norris and Bruce Lee.

73
00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:20.290
And he always wants to know he,
he loves,

74
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.180
he loved Bruce Lee instantly and he,
he,
he needs to know who wins the fight.

75
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.600
So it's like daddy does Bruce Lee when I go,
he always,

76
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:32.280
when sunny always wins and,
but my natural reaction,
cause he,

77
00:04:32.281 --> 00:04:35.440
he's constantly asking questions.
He's constantly,
does he win?

78
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.390
My natural reaction would be just watch,

79
00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:39.700
watch you gotta watch this because it's going to be sweeter.

80
00:04:39.701 --> 00:04:42.820
If you watch it and you go through the ups and downs and it goes,
no,
Daddy,

81
00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:45.790
you need to tell me now.
And I go,
no,
you're going to like it more.

82
00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:48.880
If you just watch it,
you got no daddy does.
Bruce Lee,

83
00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:53.650
when he wants to fucking know,
he don't want to be disappointed.

84
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.060
Yeah.
So he got years old.
Yeah.
He got completely blown away.
So a week later,

85
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.220
a week later,
I got to,
Dang,

86
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.660
you're going to watch the greatest martial arts movie of all time and or the

87
00:05:04.661 --> 00:05:08.200
dragon.
Cause it's Bruce Lee.
Dad,
isn't it?
I go,
yes.

88
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.740
So we sat him down,

89
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.950
we put on and he can't stop asking fucking questions about every God.

90
00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:20.650
Okay Daddy,
who are the good guys and who were the bad guys?

91
00:05:20.651 --> 00:05:24.730
Is he a bad guy or is he a good guy?
So we got it down to three main good guys.

92
00:05:24.731 --> 00:05:29.260
You know,
Bruce Lee is the main good guy.
Uh,
Williams.
I was um,

93
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.800
uh,
his name escapes me.

94
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.640
The black famous martial artists.
Jim Kelly,
Jim Keltner.
Wow.
I forgot about Jim.

95
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.430
Jim Kelly's awesome.
And uh,
he did die in the movie,
which,
I mean,

96
00:05:42.431 --> 00:05:45.880
they were doing that shit back then.
You know what I mean?
A good guy.

97
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.570
And then roper,
John Saxon,
he was the third guy.

98
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.050
It was Roper Williams and Bruce Lee and they were all,

99
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.980
they were the good guys and the bad guys.
Do you remember the bad guys' names?
No.

100
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.940
Han was the,
the,
the dude on the top left.
He's the,
he's the guy with the claws,

101
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.970
former Shaolin monk who win bad and started off selling heroin on this island

102
00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:12.380
and,
and,
and,
and uh,
prostitution rings and all that Shit.

103
00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:14.960
Completely forgot the plot of this movie.
Are you kidding me?

104
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.850
It's the greatest fucking,
I remember watching it,
but it's,
you know,

105
00:06:19.851 --> 00:06:23.240
I didn't take it seriously.
I always thought it was fun.
I was,

106
00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:25.160
I was looked at it and not like,
Holy Shit,

107
00:06:25.161 --> 00:06:26.960
we're going to see this wild action movie.

108
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.810
I always thought of it is because by the time I watched it,

109
00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:32.900
it was Kinda campy and I'm sure watching when I was a little kid had a don't

110
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:34.960
remember.
Yeah,
you gotta go back and watch a little thing.

111
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.050
Cause every one that's most people's common reactions.
Like you just remember,

112
00:06:39.051 --> 00:06:42.230
you remember the scene with Han with the razor hand.

113
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.350
He had a raise your hand,
he had a claw hand.

114
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.590
You remember Bolo young and they're fighting outside of the tournament.
You know,

115
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.580
you remember all that shit.
You remember,
um,
uh,
Williams,
uh,

116
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:59.060
getting killed.
They hung them.
Uh,
your,
you remember Williams fighting,
Hon?

117
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.460
There's certain scenes everyone will remember and you've just,

118
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:06.170
you forget about the little scenes and the plot.
So I sit down with my son,

119
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.070
I sit down,
my son and I watching this and my mom or his mom's like,

120
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.280
it's appropriate for,
for a six year old,
right?
It's not gonna get too crazy.
I go,

121
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:18.550
it's fine.
It's just a bunch of karate.
No,
it's fine.
So she's all like,
Ooh.

122
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.750
So we're sitting there and he can't stop asking God damn questions.

123
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.450
They can't stop asking God to him questions.

124
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:30.560
The bad guys are Hahn's the main guy,
O'hara Bob Wall,
remember him.

125
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.700
Everybody remembers he had a scar on his face and they,
everyone remembers that.

126
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.220
He,
uh,

127
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:41.290
was him and his gang were chasing Bruce Lee's sister in the movie and they

128
00:07:41.331 --> 00:07:44.270
cornered her and she had to kill herself.

129
00:07:44.271 --> 00:07:47.510
She just killed herself before they could like rape her or whatever.
People will,

130
00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.950
people remember that.
That's a,
another classic scene,
but you don't remember,

131
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:55.010
you don't think about all the shit in between man,
because the plot,

132
00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:59.660
the plot of the story is Han lives on an island and he has,

133
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.310
he does a lot of illegal shit.

134
00:08:01.311 --> 00:08:06.110
He runs a heroin and prostitution through his island.

135
00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:07.710
Right.
And um,

136
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:12.050
he has a tournament like once a year and he invites all the greatest martial

137
00:08:12.051 --> 00:08:16.220
artists,
um,
on earth and he tries to recruit them.

138
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:19.500
He sits them all down and he shows them his,
uh,

139
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.850
like underground operation going on,
you know what I mean?

140
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.650
So he tried to Tom Roper into it.

141
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.820
He tried to talk Williams into an era and a roper almost went for it cause he

142
00:08:28.821 --> 00:08:32.330
was a kind of,
he's a good guy,
but he was like a Gambler,
you know what I mean?

143
00:08:32.331 --> 00:08:35.900
He's kind of shady,
but at the end he's like,
fuck this,
I'm going to do this shit.

144
00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.620
So that's what he doesn't,
and he called him Bruce Lee to,
uh,

145
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:41.330
and he was going to try to recruit Bruce Lee,

146
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:46.480
but the CIA got ahold of Bruce Lee first.

147
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.100
Yes.
Seriously.

148
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:55.380
So they get ahold of Bruce Lee and they sit them down in a dark room and playing

149
00:08:55.381 --> 00:08:58.120
a projector and they're showing,
you know,
uh,

150
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:02.670
they want Bruce Lee to go in there undercover to uncover all the,
um,

151
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:08.130
uh,
Garanti fits the crime and all this stuff that was going on and doing selling

152
00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:11.430
drugs,
yes.
Drugs and prostitution and um,

153
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.750
and doing mind control on a,
so what,

154
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.400
so I'm sitting there and watching and he wants to know who the bad guys are.

155
00:09:17.401 --> 00:09:21.390
Bolo Bolos a bad guy.
O'Hara who's Bob Wall's a bad guy.
And then Hans,

156
00:09:21.391 --> 00:09:24.810
the main bad guy.
So he's constantly asking questions and then boom,

157
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:29.550
you forget about the scenes were um,
uh,
Han would,

158
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.160
has like a madam and he's got all these hookers.

159
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:34.830
There's a hooker seen you forget about the hooker scene.

160
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.530
They send like five girls to Williams.

161
00:09:37.531 --> 00:09:41.190
He was a good guy in roper to try to corrupt them,
you know what I mean?
And Boom,

162
00:09:41.191 --> 00:09:44.700
as soon it,
they're all in their gowns and in robes and Williams is like in a,

163
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:49.200
in a robe.
And I grabbed the remote and just start hitting fast forward.
And,
uh,

164
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.290
my son's a Lou,
what's going on here?
What's going on here,
dad?
Why are you fast?

165
00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:54.360
Where I'm God,
nothing's going on.
What are they doing?

166
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.880
They're getting ready to go to sleep.

167
00:09:56.881 --> 00:10:00.240
Just forget about that same poom and you forget that there's a,

168
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:06.120
is this the same?
There it is right there and there's titties and everything,

169
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.620
but um,
yeah,
he got,

170
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:14.320
he was blown away and a mission accomplished.
He's,

171
00:10:14.321 --> 00:10:18.240
he's Bruce Lee's number one in,
uh,
to him.
And,

172
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:21.600
but I had made a mistake the next week.

173
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:24.300
I made them sit down and watch return of the Dragon,

174
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.530
which the end seeing was a great scene with Chuck Norris and the old Rome

175
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:32.670
Colosseum.
But the whole movie before that is so bad.

176
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.730
It's so bad.

177
00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.150
And Bruce Lee directed it and uh,

178
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:43.710
and wrote it and it was,
uh,
it's atrocious.
It's,

179
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.590
except for the chuck.
So yeah,
except for the egg,

180
00:10:49.591 --> 00:10:53.010
but it's like high school kids put together that terror.

181
00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.740
I going to have to go back a while.
You know,
we should do,

182
00:10:55.741 --> 00:10:57.390
we should do a fight companion

183
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.040
and watch enter the dragon.
That would be fucking great dude.
Are you kidding?

184
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:06.510
Come on man.
Fight companion and watch it.
Look at the scene.

185
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:10.450
So there it's takes place in Italy.
His uh,

186
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:15.650
one of his like think his uncle or just or just somebody he knows has a Chinese

187
00:11:17.281 --> 00:11:21.660
restaurant in Italy and the Italian mob.
These guys,

188
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.320
these are the goons.
They're trying to run them out of business and,
and uh,

189
00:11:25.321 --> 00:11:29.220
control their business or Pam off to take the building or something.

190
00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:31.560
And they were,
they are resisting in Italy.

191
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:36.830
So they send a Bruce Lee from Hong Kong to handle the mob.

192
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:41.670
It's so corny.
It's fucking bad.

193
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.760
What do you think happened?
I think Bruce,
who's his partying too much,

194
00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:47.550
doing a little blow,
having a good time out on the town,

195
00:11:47.551 --> 00:11:51.000
being a big Hollywood star puts the of this movie and you just got a little

196
00:11:51.001 --> 00:11:54.040
crazy with it.
You know what this before he blew up though,

197
00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.930
<v 1>this is because he did this movie.</v>

198
00:11:55.931 --> 00:12:00.400
He did big boss Chinese connection and this one was his third one.

199
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:04.000
And then after,
this is when Warner brothers came in and signed him.

200
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.370
That's when they did enter the dragon.
That was his last one.

201
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.870
Enter the dragon was,
uh,
had a,
had a budget.
This is an haven't really any budget.

202
00:12:10.871 --> 00:12:14.650
This is a like just cheap Chinese production.
You know?

203
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:18.700
It's crazy when you think that there was really no one like him before him.

204
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.720
Like there's Chuck Norris waiting and waiting for,
I'm looking at,

205
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:26.500
I think it's other thumbs down.
You know,
when you,
when you think about there,

206
00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:30.130
there was no kind of movies like this before this,
this fight scene.

207
00:12:30.131 --> 00:12:31.900
Greatest fights seen worst movie.

208
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.350
How about the grab of the chest hair pulls a chunk of it out.

209
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:41.230
Oh sure.
I got your chest hair,
bitch.
I mean,

210
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:45.010
it's funny watching it with no volume two because it's so corny.

211
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:49.900
It looks so fake and it's all overdubbed and,
and it's,
it's God awful.
But dude,

212
00:12:49.901 --> 00:12:51.700
his martial arts technique,

213
00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:54.820
especially when you think about the fact that this was,
what,

214
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:59.560
1974 that was like 71 71.

215
00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:02.530
It was finally released in 76,
but he died in [inaudible] 73.

216
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.530
He had incredible technique,
like really good technique.

217
00:13:05.531 --> 00:13:09.290
Like he's kicking technique especially for back then.
You know,

218
00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:11.920
I think because of the Youtube and shit,
there's,

219
00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.720
there's so many guys out there that are doing like,
um,

220
00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:20.530
these jumps spinning three 60 wheel kicks.
There was some guy that mill Winkle,

221
00:13:20.531 --> 00:13:24.790
John Jackson had on his uh,
um,

222
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.950
the uh,
Instagram page and it's uh,

223
00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:32.140
a Korean gentlemen doing some fucking ridiculous shit.

224
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:37.470
Just like jumping 360 degree wheel kicks and like have a series of them

225
00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.560
cartwheels flying through the air and doing all these things.

226
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.800
Like none of this was ever in the movies before,
you know,

227
00:13:44.801 --> 00:13:49.150
until like when like maybe jet Li I guess.
No on Bach.
Right.

228
00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.120
Cause they're there a next level in terms of like athleticism.

229
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:56.140
I mean there's that Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.
I mean it's all like mystical,

230
00:13:56.510 --> 00:14:00.640
magical show.
This guy is actually doing this.
This is just a video of him.

231
00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:03.640
He starts out normal,
throws like a bunch of front kicks,

232
00:14:03.641 --> 00:14:07.210
throws a bunch of sidekicks,
and then he starts doing jumping wheel kicks,

233
00:14:07.211 --> 00:14:09.280
three 60 wheel kicks,
tornado kicks.

234
00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:11.770
He's just fucking flying through the air and flipping through the air.

235
00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:14.560
Aerial cartwheeled kicks and you're like,
Whoa,

236
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:20.260
people can do shit now.
And they do stuff in like in martial arts films,

237
00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.160
the techniques,
just way better.
They're just way better.
He just got better at it.

238
00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:27.430
Can you put that fight something back up?
But Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris,

239
00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.450
see if you could sign that video for while you're looking for,

240
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.220
just while we're talking about the one that's the one thing about Bruce Lee.

241
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.450
All the pads and he flies.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

242
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.630
It's just a guy throwing kicks in the air.
He's just throwing kicks in the air.

243
00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:42.770
It's on the Jackson wink.
Yeah,
it's Jackson.
Winkeljohn.

244
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.480
I just looked at Instagram page.
Oh,
this guy's doing it an mmn.
No,
no.

245
00:14:46.481 --> 00:14:49.740
He's doing it in the air.
Just doing it in the air.
Which of their pages should I,

246
00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.440
is he planning to use it in m

247
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:57.020
<v 0>one Jackson?
Wink MMA.
That one.
Check that one out.
There's a Korean dude.</v>

248
00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:59.990
If you keep going down,
I don't know if he's planning on using in MMA.

249
00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:04.250
My fuck is it?
God Damn it.

250
00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.430
I didn't see anything.
Hmm,

251
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:10.060
<v 2>okay.</v>

252
00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:14.950
<v 0>Maybe they were commenting on it.
Fuck somebody had it up.
Sorry.</v>

253
00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.560
Anyway,
but with Bruce Lee fight scenes,

254
00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.480
what I like about them is you could see him,

255
00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.860
although you know him beating up 50 guys at a time,
you know that,

256
00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:30.850
you know how real can that be?
But he does one on one on one fights.

257
00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.900
He does a lot of pain team.
He'll do boxing stop,
he'll do wrestling,

258
00:15:34.901 --> 00:15:39.770
he'll do Jujitsu.
You see him mix it up and he's trying to make it,
uh,

259
00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.520
a lot more realistic,
like the,
you know,

260
00:15:42.521 --> 00:15:46.170
then you have your classic Kung Fu theater type movies where they're just,

261
00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:53.260
you're
like,
yeah,

262
00:15:53.261 --> 00:15:57.490
that shit is just always a,
so Bruce Lee,
Bruce Lee,
we'll dance around,

263
00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:01.230
he'll throw a jab fade,
kick you in the leg for fake low,

264
00:16:01.231 --> 00:16:02.290
go high and knock you out.

265
00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:07.320
He does that against Chuck Norris in in a way or the dragon.

266
00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.400
And if you go back to 1970,
like that kind of martial art technique,
and he was,

267
00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:14.260
he was amazing.

268
00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:18.280
He was also the first guy that figured out how to put a bunch of martial arts

269
00:16:18.281 --> 00:16:22.930
together and just forget about judo,
your karate,
if you had about that,
just,
just,

270
00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:27.140
just use everything that works.
Everything from everywhere.
Yeah.

271
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:31.810
That was heresy back then.
I mean,
he might've been,
um,
uh,

272
00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:35.620
he may have been the first guy to do that.
Really.
I mean.
