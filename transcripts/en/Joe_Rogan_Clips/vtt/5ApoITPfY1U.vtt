1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.340
It's what they,
that's kind of what they've done.
I mean,
um,
obviously the uh,

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.130
like the Louis C K situation,

3
00:00:05.131 --> 00:00:08.730
I know that is so people are so divided on that one.

4
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.620
And my opinion is if,
if he didn't do anything,

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.860
um,
make anyone do anything against their will,

6
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.090
he's just a guy that has a strange proclivity,
you know,

7
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:22.800
he likes jerking off in front of people.

8
00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:24.790
Apparently the cat's out of the bag there,

9
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.060
but like where those girls that upset 20 years ago with a,

10
00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:33.100
that upset 20 years ago that,

11
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.190
that now it's an issue or with a giggling where they let like I need to know how

12
00:00:38.191 --> 00:00:42.480
they were then cause I don't give a fuck what you think now.
Like at the time,

13
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.150
what was it?
Okay.
Was it cool with you?
Oh,

14
00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:49.050
did you sit there and fucking rib elbow to the ribs with your girlfriend and go

15
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:53.220
look at the sky jerking off in front of us?
Uh,
to me,

16
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.750
I don't care what,
what time has done because it,
the,
the,

17
00:00:57.751 --> 00:00:59.010
the way something looks,

18
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.160
the morality or ethics or respect that is expected in 2018 ain't what it was 20

19
00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:06.810
years ago.
Right.

20
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.070
So you can't be held liable for something you did 20 years ago when it was

21
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.280
normal or a little strange or whatever the fuck it was.
Well,

22
00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:16.320
I think it's always been weird to beat off in front of people.

23
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.500
That's an odd thing to do.

24
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.030
<v 1>No.
The same thing about it is though he asked if he could write,</v>

25
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.720
and this is something that I've,
I've brought up to be,
oh,
you know,

26
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:24.870
when people say,
Oh,
you know,

27
00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:27.730
he would lock these women in the room and beat off I to stop.
Okay,

28
00:01:27.731 --> 00:01:29.700
if you're gonna,
if you're gonna like push this,

29
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.670
you're saying that because that fits your narrative.

30
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.820
He's this abusive person who's abusing his power.

31
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.550
Now here's another problem with that.
When this was all going down,

32
00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:42.830
he wasn't very famous.
No,
that's just a two.
So what power was he abusing?
He,

33
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.090
he was a successful comedian.

34
00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:47.640
He was admired by his peers because he was really funny.

35
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.860
He wasn't Louis C k like the superstar filling out Madison Square Garden.

36
00:01:52.861 --> 00:01:55.650
Louis C.
K.
Yeah.
It wasn't the same guy.
You know,
he,

37
00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:59.790
he didn't even have all the HBO specials and all the Netflix specials.
Same Guy.

38
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.710
So he was just another comic.

39
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.590
They'd like to beat off in front of people and he would ask first.

40
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.240
So when you say that he,
you know,
forced these women and wouldn't let them leave,

41
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.160
none of them say that.
In fact,
he asked and when they said no,
he didn't do it,

42
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.290
he didn't say,
oh,
well good.

43
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.320
You don't want me to beat off down and make it feel even better when I beat off

44
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.460
in front of you.
I'll shut the fuck up and sit down.
You know,
he doesn't do it.

45
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.360
<v 0>No,
no.
He was asking which is,
which is so strange but weird thing.</v>

46
00:02:28.361 --> 00:02:31.870
It's not,
it's,
it's not in the same realm as,

47
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.580
as Harvey Weinstein not even fucking know.
It's not even close.

48
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.400
<v 1>It's not even close.
But people don't want you to rationalize.
No,</v>

49
00:02:40.401 --> 00:02:43.880
don't want you to grade things.
They just want to talk about abuse.

50
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.350
All abuse gets shoveled into this one little pie chart area.

51
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.960
Like this is male abusers.
Yeah.

52
00:02:50.961 --> 00:02:55.410
And then they'll put Matt Lauer right next to bill Cosby,
right next to Louis Ck.

53
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.550
Like,
well,
this seems kind of crazy.
And then when you say it's crazy,

54
00:02:58.551 --> 00:02:59.810
like Matt said,
let's,

55
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.980
<v 0>I think we should make a distinction.
They like,
oh yeah,</v>

56
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.570
you can't be your,

57
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.520
you'll become a rape apologist if you,
uh,
if you say things like that.
And,
uh,
it,

58
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.210
it's weird.
