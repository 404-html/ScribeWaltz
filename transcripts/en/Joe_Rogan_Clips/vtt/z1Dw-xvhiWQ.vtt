00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.940
Anytime I've had to do a transcript for,

2
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:03.580
cause I don't write anything down Longhand,

3
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.000
but when I've had to do a transcript for tonight's show or like just for laughs

4
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:09.610
festival and see it,
then you start writing new tags and you're like,

5
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.190
all this took was for me to write it out.

6
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.930
But then what do you do from Microsoft word?

7
00:00:13.931 --> 00:00:17.320
Then you take it to get to that scrivener and then what do you do there?

8
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.690
<v 1>Put it,</v>

9
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.030
I take the stuff from Microsoft word and then I trim it down and when I trim it

10
00:00:22.031 --> 00:00:25.780
down,
I put it in scrivener and when I've trim it down and put it in Scribnar,

11
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.770
what I'm essentially doing is saying,
okay,
this is ready,
this is ready to play.

12
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.980
And then what it scrivener do?
Oh Shit,

13
00:00:32.981 --> 00:00:36.250
I left my fucking notebook in a hotel room.
God dammit damn,

14
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.570
someone's going to freak out.

15
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.420
So then from there I write things out on an actual notebook and the actual

16
00:00:45.071 --> 00:00:50.071
notebook is basically just to get my set list in order and to make sure I

17
00:00:50.591 --> 00:00:54.040
highlight all the different tags.
So there's three stages.

18
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.140
There's the Microsoft word stage,

19
00:00:56.141 --> 00:01:00.820
which is basically just free form free association,
writing things down.

20
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.050
No,
there's no structure to it.
Sometimes it comes out like a bit,

21
00:01:05.051 --> 00:01:07.750
sometimes it's just nonsense that never goes anywhere.
Okay.

22
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.520
<v 0>You needed to get out anyway so you could get to other stuff</v>

23
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.640
<v 1>you just urging.
Yeah,
well it's,
I don't know if you need it,</v>

24
00:01:13.641 --> 00:01:17.660
but it's like there's a road they get onto and as you're on that road,

25
00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:20.040
all of a sudden you're like,
oh look,
I found a bag of gold and,

26
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:24.260
and you don't find that bag of gold.
If you stay home,
you gotta walk,

27
00:01:24.261 --> 00:01:25.730
you gotta get out there.
And that's,

28
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.770
that's what the writing does with the writing does,

29
00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:30.200
it allows you to pick up these little bags of gold along the way.

30
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.620
And then I take these little bags of gold when I pile them up and then I throw

31
00:01:33.621 --> 00:01:36.980
them into the fortress and the fortress is like scrivener.

32
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.140
So then I can move those bits around.

33
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.460
<v 0>What is scrivener did?
Like,
what is it?
Why was it different than Microsoft?
Well,</v>

34
00:01:42.461 --> 00:01:42.890
the reason why

35
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.090
<v 1>it's different,
it's because it's set up in columns,
right?
So you see how,</v>

36
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.450
and it's also has cork boards.
See Jamie's got it up on the big screen.

37
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.840
So when the cork boards see how it's set up right here,

38
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.960
like each one of these things,

39
00:01:56.961 --> 00:01:58.940
if you go to the the left side here,

40
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.630
each one of these categories I can move and I can,
I can change,

41
00:02:02.631 --> 00:02:05.450
I can have that bit in the beginning at the end.

42
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.630
And then once I'm in the bit I could also go to this and that sets me up with a

43
00:02:10.671 --> 00:02:15.140
cork board.
So I can have like,
I could set up little,
uh,
nope.

44
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.560
Like little a set setlist well like that,

45
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.200
like up there little notepad things.

46
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.260
So I could write down these on these index cards.

47
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.060
Like don't forget this or this is important here.
Or this tagline is huge.

48
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.840
Try switching this around and it's just this constant.

49
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.180
<v 0>But are you already like this or you already this kind of an organized person.</v>

50
00:02:37.181 --> 00:02:38.850
Have you always been this way or did you get those?

51
00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:40.540
You have to know this is a discipline.
