Hello Freak bitches.
There's not a lot of guys like you out there,

2
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.000
which is really interesting.
It's like you're a fast thinking,
fast talking,

3
00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:13.210
very smart young guy who's also a conservative.

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.280
Like there's not a lot of those out there.

5
00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:17.590
And this is one of the things that we're encountering today is there,

6
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.900
especially in college campuses,

7
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.930
there's this very strange separation between the left and the right to the point

8
00:00:25.811 --> 00:00:29.890
where the right is like almost nonexistent or at least doesn't have any

9
00:00:29.891 --> 00:00:33.880
representation.
And they're actively shunning that representation.

10
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.790
Like they're pushing people out.
I know what's going on with you in Berkeley?

11
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.110
Has that had been written seven resolved?

12
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.790
<v 1>Yeah,
I think that,
uh,
so,
so Berkeley,</v>

13
00:00:39.791 --> 00:00:42.220
after the publicity they said they're going to explain to people if they don't

14
00:00:42.221 --> 00:00:45.370
know the whole story.
Yes.
So UC Berkeley,
if you recall last year,

15
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.940
I actually spoke there before any of this happen and I spoke at UC Berkeley and

16
00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:49.260
like April,
2016,
uh,

17
00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:52.570
and then my low was supposed to speak there and he actually went there and there

18
00:00:52.571 --> 00:00:55.810
was a riot,
were antifa infiltrated the,
the student community.

19
00:00:55.811 --> 00:00:58.510
And there are all these pictures of them bombing things and you know,

20
00:00:58.511 --> 00:01:01.540
blowing up cars and then understanding them in a fire at least and throwing

21
00:01:01.541 --> 00:01:05.500
things at windows.
And so Berkeley shut down that event for safety reasons.

22
00:01:05.501 --> 00:01:08.940
Then Ann Coulter wanting to speak there and they basically used what they called

23
00:01:08.941 --> 00:01:11.260
time,
place and manner restrictions to stopper.
They kept sending,

24
00:01:11.261 --> 00:01:13.720
well we have safety problems,
we can't figure out how to do the event.

25
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.840
And in the end they just canceled it because they didn't have security.

26
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.300
And then young Americans Foundation,

27
00:01:19.301 --> 00:01:21.520
which sponsors me to go to a lot of these campuses,
they said,

28
00:01:21.521 --> 00:01:23.020
we want Shapiro to come.
And again,

29
00:01:23.021 --> 00:01:25.540
I spoke to like a year and a half ago and they give them two and a half months

30
00:01:25.541 --> 00:01:28.900
advance.
And Berkeley said,
well,
we have no venues available.

31
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.960
And so this seemed to be another cover for,

32
00:01:31.961 --> 00:01:35.710
we're not going to allow conservative on campus because are security problems.

33
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.860
So we made that public and then Berkeley said,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Well we'll make,

34
00:01:38.861 --> 00:01:39.850
we'll make sure that you get in.

35
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.430
They give us an alternative venue and are they even said they'd covered the

36
00:01:42.431 --> 00:01:44.110
security thinks they didn't like the bad publicity.

37
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.870
<v 0>Oh,
well that's nice.
Yes.
That should be good.
Well,</v>

38
00:01:46.871 --> 00:01:50.320
you know what happened with Jordan Peterson yesterday?
Yes.
Yeah.
Just yesterday,

39
00:01:50.321 --> 00:01:55.321
Jordan Peterson was banned from youtube and Youtube has a new policy that uh,

40
00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.870
it's very,
it's very weirdly worded,

41
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.140
but apparently they're allowed to block and restrict any kind of videos that are

42
00:02:05.021 --> 00:02:09.520
about religion or that could be deemed offensive,
which is almost everything.

43
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.050
<v 1>Yeah,
that's right.
Anything that's remotely,
I mean,</v>

44
00:02:12.051 --> 00:02:14.960
anything that's interesting is,
is going to be offensive to somebody.

45
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.700
<v 0>So won't be monetized.
It also won't be in the remote areas of interest or</v>

46
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.650
<v 1>I know they did this to a Prager university as well.</v>

47
00:02:21.651 --> 00:02:25.760
They'd blocked like 10 of their videos a couple of months ago.
So it's,
it's,
yeah,

48
00:02:25.761 --> 00:02:28.760
I mean this is nasty stuff.
And listen,
Youtube as a private company,

49
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:29.930
they have the right to do what they want,

50
00:02:29.931 --> 00:02:33.530
but don't proclaim that you're a free speech promoting institution if you're

51
00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:35.370
going to block people like Jordan Peterson for God's sake.

52
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.951
<v 0>Well,
the,</v>

53
00:02:35.951 --> 00:02:40.670
the problem is they're not blocking things that are offensive to other people

54
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.851
there.

55
00:02:40.851 --> 00:02:44.900
They're not blocking certain things that are representing Islam in a positive

56
00:02:44.901 --> 00:02:46.030
light.
That's right.
There's a,

57
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.040
there's a lot of weirdness with this left wing choice of what to sensor and what

58
00:02:51.501 --> 00:02:55.130
not to censor and it's,
it's not just dangerous.

59
00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.190
It's also bad for the whole idea of being progressive or being a liberal cause

60
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:01.900
it makes you look,

61
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.470
it makes them look really petty and really weird and really resistant and

62
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:09.580
hesitant to actually have real debate.

63
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.280
<v 1>Yeah,
for sure.</v>

64
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.170
And this is one of the reasons why I'm very meticulous in my terminology about

65
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:16.660
people who are on the other side of the aisle actually separate people who are

66
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:17.950
liberal from people who are left test.

67
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.690
So when there are people who try to ban speech,

68
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.570
I call them leftist and if they are not interested in banning speech,

69
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.520
then their liberal meaning they want bigger government.

70
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:25.630
They disagree with me on politics,

71
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:28.870
but they're still willing to have a conversation and they want an open forum.

72
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.320
People who are on the hard left think that it's actually an insult to their

73
00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:35.170
identity to disagree with them.
And this is what I experienced sometimes on,

74
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.440
on campuses,
you know,
at cal state la where there's a near riot when I speak,

75
00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:41.590
or University of Wisconsin where people stormed the stage and stand in front of

76
00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:44.020
it and won't leave.
Or the state where we have,
again,

77
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:47.170
another near violence incident over at Penn state or DePaul where they actually

78
00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:50.080
banned me outright.
So sometimes you get this routine,
uh,

79
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.190
from people who think that they conflate their viewpoint with their identity.

80
00:03:54.191 --> 00:03:57.520
And then if you have a different viewpoint,
you're denying them their humanity.

81
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.730
And it's like,
no,
I'm not the nine year.
I just think what you're saying is dumb.

82
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.280
<v 0>Good point.</v>

83
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.210
That's a very good point is that they have their identity completely connected

84
00:04:06.211 --> 00:04:10.590
with their ideology.
And when you oppose these people,

85
00:04:10.591 --> 00:04:12.060
when you have these debates or these people,

86
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.500
what's really fascinating is the level of a stereo that gets reached while

87
00:04:16.501 --> 00:04:17.550
you're staying calm.

88
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.400
<v 1>Yeah.
That's what I've noticed is,
is that there's a ton of,
you know,
I,</v>

89
00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:23.860
I tend to keep relatively calm just as a human being.

90
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.970
And very often when I'm debating someone,

91
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.570
you see them getting more and more and more emotional and people on the right

92
00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:31.210
love this because of course it's the triggering of the snowflakes,
right?

93
00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:34.120
The easiest thing in the world to do is trigger some idiot college kid who

94
00:04:34.121 --> 00:04:36.430
doesn't know his ass from a hole in the ground.
And it,
well,
what's,

95
00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:39.790
what's hard to do is actually discuss issues with somebody who's intelligent

96
00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:43.350
enough to make the,
to make the point.
But it's,
it,
the,

97
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.030
the level of hysteria on the campuses has really increased.
I mean,

98
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.600
I now have to travel with two members of security to every campus just cause you

99
00:04:49.601 --> 00:04:51.130
don't know which campus is going to go off.

100
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.770
I never had to travel security before.
It's the weirdest thing in the world.
