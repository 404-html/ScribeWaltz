WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.140
Work Excellence.
That mind,
that is what built that company.

2
00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:05.820
And one is a billion dollar company.

3
00:00:05.821 --> 00:00:09.840
Now it's $1 billion company that's in 1.7 billion homes in Asia.

4
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.570
This isn't some mythological idea.

5
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.370
This is a guy who's built a massive company based around these values and that's

6
00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:20.830
a different thing.
He's,
well,
what does he say about common?
Oh sorry,
yeah,

7
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.080
I go off on this deal.
It's cool.
Uh,

8
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.110
so he looks at it as the things that he says and the way that,
and again,

9
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:30.480
I shouldn't speak for him.
This is the what I've gathered,

10
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.840
throwing things and creating conflict and controversy as your currency is not

11
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:36.810
something to be proud of.

12
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.770
That's an interesting way of putting it as your currency.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I get it.

13
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.760
You know,
and that sounds because,
and I'm not quite all the,

14
00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:46.110
although I've drank the Koolaid,

15
00:00:46.111 --> 00:00:48.540
I believe in what they're doing and I see it as real,

16
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.760
not only cause my values line up with it,

17
00:00:50.761 --> 00:00:54.360
but I think they are going to grow dramatically as a result of some of these,

18
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.820
the way they see the world.
But not only that,

19
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.960
but I'm still also immersed here.
And I like Connor,

20
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.910
I think of Connor,

21
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.890
I worked for Tsm because Connor fell out of a march to a red carpet to shake my

22
00:01:07.891 --> 00:01:11.790
hand while the,
my boss was watching.
You know what I mean?
Yeah,
yeah.

23
00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:13.080
Like the great,

24
00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:15.990
some of the most interesting moments I've had are with that guy and some of the

25
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.880
most interesting,
you know,

26
00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:22.620
many dozens of hours of trying to figure out what's happening in research and

27
00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:26.370
growth has happened by studying that guy.
And I see his,

28
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.570
the games that he is willing to play as part of his strategy for success as a

29
00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:34.830
fighter and success trying to be,
you know,

30
00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:36.510
successful for his family and his future.

31
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:40.170
I see it all connected so I don't dislike him,
but I respect this,

32
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.270
this idea that conflict and controversy are not good for us.

33
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.163
I understand that.

34
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.570
<v 1>But I also understand psychological warfare and I think the condor is a master</v>

35
00:01:49.571 --> 00:01:51.880
of that and that has a huge factor in victory.
I mean,

36
00:01:51.881 --> 00:01:56.000
this is something Miyamoto Musashi use to his advantage.
Um,
you know,

37
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.180
if you read the book of five rings,
he,

38
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.380
what Connor's doing is fucking with people's heads the point where they,

39
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.460
he has space in their head and then Conor goes into the cage,

40
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.440
like loose as a goose,
relaxed and calm.
So he's letting you know,

41
00:02:11.441 --> 00:02:15.610
I don't give a fuck about you but you give a fuck about me and I'm going to fuck

42
00:02:15.611 --> 00:02:18.720
you up right now.
And you're like,
no,
you're not.
You better not.
You can't,
I can't.

43
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.850
This is too much.
And Josie Aldo is the perfect example,

44
00:02:21.851 --> 00:02:26.851
although was so out of composure a although charged at him with that just

45
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.420
leaping left hook and just got fucking waylaid on the way in.

46
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.720
<v 0>And Eddie Alvarez,
the greatest game day performer,</v>

47
00:02:32.721 --> 00:02:35.180
one of the Great Game Day performance we've ever seen.

48
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.960
And I talked to Ed l that he's one of my favorites and I admire and am inspired

49
00:02:42.381 --> 00:02:46.460
by Eddie Alvarez,
Michael Chandler to,
you know,
those two are like the same guy,

50
00:02:46.461 --> 00:02:49.490
all lost,
you know.
But Eddie was like,

51
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.410
the plan was to wrestle a lot and stay at distance and barely at all.

52
00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:57.550
And I stayed a distance almost the whole time and barely Russell like he was

53
00:02:57.551 --> 00:03:00.000
just like,
it was real.
I cannot,
and

54
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.210
<v 1>by not accepting it was real coming in and suddenly you find yourself in there</v>

55
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:06.580
and it's real and you feel different and your,
you know,

56
00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:09.370
your mind is working differently and your hormones are working differently and

57
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:13.180
who you are and that moment is different and you're like holy fuck,
it's real.

58
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.130
Had I prepared for it to be real?

59
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.550
I could be in a different state right now but I denied that this was going to be

60
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:22.510
real and now it's fucking real.
Santa Claus is real.
It's real.

61
00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:25.660
I also think you got clipped early on.
I think that's a factor.
You know,

62
00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:29.290
you get caught on the chin like that and your legs give out real quick and your

63
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.380
just,
your brain doesn't work right anymore.
Your body is more quiet anymore.

64
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:33.340
I think that's a factor.

65
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.670
The ability that Connor has to land those sharp shots that come out of nowhere

66
00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:43.960
and blitz you and come at you so fast and just drop those shots on you.

67
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.330
I mean,
his left hand is a fucking laser beam and that's so good planning.

68
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.070
That's what that is.
The definition of it.

69
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.930
He's so good at landing that shot and he's also good at landing a bunch of other

70
00:03:55.931 --> 00:04:00.820
shit too,
man mean pick you apart.
He's a,
he's a real dynamo.
I just,

71
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.590
I hate to see things like what happened in New York and Brooklyn and he threw

72
00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:10.540
the Dolly at the bus and smashed the window.
It's like,
so it's so fucking stupid.

73
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.680
All that thuggish shit running in with a bunch of other guys and everyone's

74
00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:17.350
screaming at w was what?
What did Khabib do?

75
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.410
He smacked your friend in the face because your friend friend was talking shit.

76
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.530
So you know,
I mean,
and the,
the,
even the way smacked him was pretty general,

77
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.880
you know what I mean?
And Artem called him a coward and he said,
didn't,

78
00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:32.220
he doesn't find Connor's a real fighters.
Like,
listen man,
I know he's Russian.

79
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.930
Your a Russian,
you guys got to sort this out on your own.

80
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.130
That is how they sorted it out.

81
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.660
And it was a pretty calm sorting out in my opinion.
They didn't stop him,

82
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.160
they didn't beat his ass.
But once we get to that point,
I mean I get it,

83
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.560
they have one to eight,
you're doing something and I'm responding,

84
00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:50.050
which he responds.
That happens everyday in gangs,

85
00:04:50.051 --> 00:04:54.340
in wars in Northern Ireland and Ireland and all types of religions that's been

86
00:04:54.341 --> 00:04:57.940
going on forever.
Nobody ever wins when that happens,
it just goes,

87
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.200
it just perpetuates it.

88
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.020
And when you watch it and then there'll be a lot of people,

89
00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:07.021
you see this scenario and like Habib's fans or friends or supporters and condos

90
00:05:08.111 --> 00:05:11.860
and they're like,
he did this,
he did this.
They're both wrong.
And nobody,

91
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.400
everybody always,
when somebody does something bad to somebody else,

92
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.860
they almost always feel like something was but done bad to them.

93
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.130
Very few people instigate that was perceived.
Something happened.

94
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.320
They perceive a slight and you know,

95
00:05:23.321 --> 00:05:27.190
some people you do one thing to them and then they're like,
okay mother fucker,

96
00:05:27.191 --> 00:05:31.710
now it's to eternity.
Right?
Okay,
look,
well that doesn't make any sense either.

97
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.840
Now,
you know,
you look like a fool.
You know,

98
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.590
you just can't throw a Dolly at a bus.
No.
You know,

99
00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:42.220
filled with other fighters because it's so selfish.
I mean,

100
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.350
all those people that got caught,
you know,

101
00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.800
I mean Ray Borg got cuts in his eyes.
I mean,

102
00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:49.390
this is the whole thing is a disaster.

103
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.870
So my theory based on bits of information that,

104
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.650
that we have is that Connor,
on some level it,
I mean,

105
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.790
it reinforces

106
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:59.860
<v 0>constantly.
If you,</v>

107
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.560
if your kid does something terrible that we know is bad and he'd give him candy

108
00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:07.130
every time they're going to do snatch yet God give her candy.

109
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.960
Every time she does something,
that reward conn has been rewarded.
He gets richer,

110
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.210
more famous,
more influential,
the belts,

111
00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:18.920
and he's been given candy every time he's done this.

112
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:23.720
And it works.
And I mean,
there was parallels in the political system in America.

113
00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:27.620
There's parallels all over the world that by acting out in these strange ways,

114
00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:31.220
it's so bizarre and unsettling that we reward it.
You know,

115
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.660
Ben Candy for Babby.
Yeah,
that'd be fun.

116
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.510
But that's what's happening.
Right?
And so now we take it and he's,

117
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.970
and then you add the strategy element that you're talking about it,
right.

118
00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:48.140
So he's looking at it and it's like,
okay,
uh,
Habib would be a great fight.

119
00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:51.800
I'd like to fight in Russia.
He likes challenges.
It's just hard.
But let's do it.

120
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.060
Now,
if I create some viral controversy,
which I did with,

121
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.900
with Paulie Malignaggi,
who's a have you,
do you know Polly?

122
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.110
I've only talked to him on Twitter.
I don't know.
I fucking love Polly.

123
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.980
And I liked him as a dude.
I really do.
Um,
uh,
but uh,

124
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.610
so he created that in the work and it's like,
okay,
whether,

125
00:07:13.611 --> 00:07:16.430
how on what level he's strategizing this,
he's like,

126
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.550
let's go do some pushing and shoving with Habib and his guys.

127
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:21.960
Some given the finger,
it'll be caught on cameras.
What a,

128
00:07:21.961 --> 00:07:25.910
what one thing we know about Connor,
he's always late,
always late.

129
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:27.770
He didn't plan to get there when they're on a bus.

130
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.570
He planned to get there when they're in the hall.

131
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.730
He planned to get their windows,
a bunch of people around.

132
00:07:31.731 --> 00:07:33.470
It's security and it's easy to manage.

133
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.790
Little push and a little shove in a couple of cameras and all of a sudden his $5

134
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:38.101
million pay day,

135
00:07:38.101 --> 00:07:41.240
it's a $12 million pay day in Russia and everybody's going crazy.
It'll work.

136
00:07:41.241 --> 00:07:44.540
It's brilliant,
but he's late.
So he shows up there on the bus.

137
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.510
Now the cameras are out and what's he going to do?
He's got to perform.

138
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.870
He came there to perform it,
came there to do a thing.
We showed up and now it,

139
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:56.110
now it goes sideways and that's the most likely scenario is that it was a,

140
00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:01.610
let's do it.
It'll be,
it'll feel right for us as,
as defending our friend,

141
00:08:01.611 --> 00:08:05.060
but also we'll have some inherent value in the cameras come out and nobody will

142
00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:05.894
get hurt.

143
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:08.750
<v 1>I think you're probably right there.
It's got a good,
he's got a good point,</v>

144
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:13.670
but obviously it's a terrible thing to do and stupid.
You know,
there's,

145
00:08:13.671 --> 00:08:16.520
there's a way to manage that,
but then there's,
people say,
well,
you know,

146
00:08:16.521 --> 00:08:19.760
now it becomes like the WWE and you know,
there's,

147
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:24.910
there's people that love real fighting that have a real hard time with these

148
00:08:25.521 --> 00:08:30.110
fake WWE style scenarios where you know that,

149
00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:35.240
whether it's Colby Covington,
yeah,
he did a promo recently.
We had a,

150
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:40.040
a girl by the pool and the girl sat in his lap and she was like,

151
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:45.070
obviously had a plan script and it seemed kind of Corny people.

152
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:48.980
There's people who think that's great and there's people fucking hate it.

153
00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:49.840
<v 0>I'm the hate it.</v>

154
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.180
<v 1>Yeah.
I'm the hated too.
I don't,
I mean,</v>

155
00:08:52.181 --> 00:08:53.800
I don't have a real problem with pro wrestling.

156
00:08:53.801 --> 00:08:56.860
I joke around about it all the time and I get the fact that people like it.

157
00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:00.940
I don't like that kind of shit bleeding into MMA.
I think it's dumb.
