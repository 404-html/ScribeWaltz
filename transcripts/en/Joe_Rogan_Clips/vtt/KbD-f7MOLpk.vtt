WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.530
But the time was right.
You know,

2
00:00:01.531 --> 00:00:05.790
and then I started having issues with my good eye as well after the gas fight.

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.160
So I'm like,
you know,
this is a word now because you,

4
00:00:09.161 --> 00:00:13.740
you had oil in one of your eyes.
Yeah.
Can you explain how that was going on?
Yeah.

5
00:00:13.741 --> 00:00:18.620
So when I detach my retina,
um,
they did what's called a slur or buccal.

6
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.560
Uh,
if you,
if you've watched their surgery,

7
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.330
it's absolutely disgusting.
But,
uh,
one of the things that they do,

8
00:00:27.331 --> 00:00:30.570
the gas inside your eye,
and I think if I'm getting this wrong,

9
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:31.680
I apologize to all doctors,

10
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:35.500
but the kind of kind of helps hold the retina in place.
Um,

11
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.620
but you can't fly with that.

12
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.960
And I was filming a movie in England a few weeks later.
I said,
and I said,

13
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.560
you can't do this,
and I'm filming a move.
And they went,
okay,

14
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:46.500
there's another way we can do it.
It's a little more unconventional.

15
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.100
We can put oil inside there,
but then with that you can fly.
So I'm like,
okay,

16
00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:54.210
cool,
do that.
So,
uh,
they did that,
uh,

17
00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.340
yeah.
You know,
it's
Nah.
And then it really detached.

18
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.040
And then I got glaucoma.
I just had a lot of bad luck.

19
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.540
I did whatever can go wrong with an I trust me.
I went through it.

20
00:01:08.541 --> 00:01:11.360
But it looks different now.
Yeah,
it does.
Yeah,
it does.
Yeah.

21
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.550
But it looks better than it looked great.
What did you do?

22
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.810
It looks great.
Don't worry about a job.
Oh,
you don't want to talk?
No,
no,

23
00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:24.560
you're good.
You got it.
It's okay.
It's a,
it's a corrective lens.
Oh,
okay.

24
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.570
It's a corrective lenses.
A prosthetic.
So can you see well,
out of that,

25
00:01:29.571 --> 00:01:34.280
I see.
I see.
'EM At tiny,
tiny,
tiny,
tiny,

26
00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:37.730
tiny,
tiny bit.
Oh really?
Yeah.
So I don't,
I don't really see out of it.

27
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.440
And divisions very blurred.
I'm going to,
I was able to pass the test to pass,

28
00:01:42.441 --> 00:01:45.950
to be able to clear by commission to fight.
You've got to have 2100 vision,

29
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.910
which I was able to scrape by with the skin of my teeth.
Wow.
You know,

30
00:01:49.911 --> 00:01:54.260
so I'm a doctor was always amazed that I could still see to that amount if I,

31
00:01:54.261 --> 00:01:57.590
if I squinted in the right direction and a turned here and the light was just

32
00:01:57.591 --> 00:02:01.220
right,
I could just about make out 2100.
Wow.
So,
uh,

33
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.080
but what happens is then that then,

34
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:06.080
cause you see in two different images distorted him and you see your brain

35
00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:08.030
councils the distorted one,
you know,

36
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.700
so with the depth perception remains the same.

37
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.520
No depth perception is a real issue.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know,
uh,

38
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.100
it was an issue throughout my last few fights.
For me,
the main thing,
I mean,

39
00:02:19.101 --> 00:02:24.000
as I say,
you know,
uh,
I was cleared medically by the doctors and you know,

40
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.430
the UFC were very,
very on top of all of that.
The UFC,
you know,

41
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.570
send me to a number of different doctors and whatnot.
And as I say,
uh,
uh,

42
00:02:32.571 --> 00:02:35.690
pass the test just,
but it was,
and every time I did the doctors were like,

43
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.530
we don't recommend that you fight,
you know,
you,
of course,
2100 vision,

44
00:02:39.531 --> 00:02:44.120
it's still clinically blind.
Uh,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
So,
um,

45
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.890
but,
but yeah,
yeah,
there you go.
That's fucking crazy.
Yeah.

46
00:02:48.891 --> 00:02:52.310
But it never slowed me down.
It didn't slow it down.
That's what's crazy

47
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.673
looking by now.

48
00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.010
If I sit there at night and get drunk,
watch my old fights.

49
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:02.980
I've never done that once.
But if I have a Douchey,
some old fights,

50
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:05.950
by which occasion just happens by chance,
you know,

51
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.250
afterwards I'm always calling for a shot at the belt or whatever.

52
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.940
As it's more laughs,
fuck with this guy thinking,
get out of it.

53
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.830
He's out of his mind,
you know,
absolutely out of his mind.
But at that time,

54
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.030
it quitting and trying to not be come the champion did not even occur to me for

55
00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:28.180
a split second.
Giving up never even occurred to me for a heartbeat.

56
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.040
Why is that?
Is this how you've always been?
This is something I still felt.

57
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.720
I still felt that I could,
I could win it.
Simple as that,
you know?
Um,

58
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.080
but a lot of guys have the lost most of the use of one of their eyes would have

59
00:03:41.081 --> 00:03:45.730
been done.
Yeah.
For sure.
No,
no chance.
It's not worth it.
Yeah,
no,
I know.

60
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.340
Um,
and

61
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.940
probably the smart thing to do would it were,
would have been one of those guys.

62
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.200
But for me,
you know,
I,
it meant a lot to me out.
I want to,

63
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.930
I wanted to become the champion.
I knew I could become the champion,

64
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.980
contrary to popular belief.
And,
um,

65
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.100
this is me.
They,
they,
it was my identity.
And until I won that belt,

66
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.660
I wasn't happy.
Now when I want it,
my wife said she wanted me to be.

67
00:04:13.661 --> 00:04:17.330
So when I fought Luke in,
in La,
she said,
if you win,

68
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.550
I want you to retire.
I said,
bed.
If I lose,
then I'll retire.

69
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.540
Okay.
Cause Fair enough.
I got my towel sharp.
You know,
it didn't go on my way.

70
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.130
It is what it is.
I would have had closure on that.
I said,
well,
if I win,
yeah.

71
00:04:31.131 --> 00:04:34.330
The fucking mind.
If you think I'm going to retire this,
come on.
Oh,

72
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.410
the jump we did the world,
they're going to milk it for a little bit.

73
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.810
Finally earn some decent pay days,
you know?
Uh,
so yeah,
but,
um,

74
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.900
it all worked out.
