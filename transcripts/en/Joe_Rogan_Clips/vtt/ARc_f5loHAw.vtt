Hello Freak bitches.

What do you think he walked away with?

2
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.960
Oh,
he took 10 up front to make it.
He probably got a ton of money.

3
00:00:10.961 --> 00:00:14.980
I don't know how it works.
Points.
He's probably got 30,
30 million out of that.

4
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.310
Maybe balling out of control crews.
Hit us up,

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.340
I would love to see it.

8
00:00:31.901 --> 00:00:34.850
I fucking love him.
He did a bunch of episodes on the showtime show identity.

9
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.530
Yeah.
Dude,
it's fucking so awesome that they got like real comics,
man.

10
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.480
The showtime show looks great,
man.

11
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.640
<v 1>Love how authentic everybody looks and the hairstyles</v>

<v 0>it real comics.
Y'all magical.
You drawn Erik Griffin.</v>

13
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.020
Giran uh,
um,

14
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.560
fucking dumb.
Earl Skakel does a few Poppins on it.
Um,

15
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.890
oh my God.
Oh,
I'm drum drawing such a blank.

16
00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:05.670
There's so many other guys that like came in and left.
She already fucking gold.

17
00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:10.080
Yeah,
that's that man.
That's crazy.
And Melissa's mullets,
you guys and Leo

18
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.030
<v 1>feel like an extreme amount of responsibility while you were doing this because</v>

19
00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:18.560
you're doing a movie that's based on the most important comedy club in my

20
00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:19.550
opinion.
Ever.

21
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.580
<v 0>Yeah.
TV show,
but yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
You're doing a show.</v>

22
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.480
The pressure was fucking,
yeah man.
I felt the pressure,

23
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.230
the responsibility was fucking huge.
Wow.

24
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.340
We premiered last night and it will air this Sunday and uh,

25
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.850
Jim Carrey said some amazing things,
man.
Yeah.
That's our cast photo.

26
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.330
That one that you clicked that one.
Yeah.
Did it feel weird to be on that?

27
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.150
I mean it must have been like,
I can tell you from the bottom of my honest heart,

28
00:01:46.151 --> 00:01:49.750
it was the most important thing I've done so far.
Wow.
Dude.

29
00:01:49.751 --> 00:01:54.280
I mean we're paying homage to the world that,
that we love and respect so much.

30
00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:57.220
And it was a big effort on Jim's part and his producing partner,

31
00:01:57.221 --> 00:01:58.750
Michael Aguilar to like tell real stories.

32
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.850
A lot of the stories that people will see if you watch the show,

33
00:02:00.851 --> 00:02:04.300
and I hope you do come from Jim's real life to do term Boston moved.

34
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.090
They live in a fucking dude's closet in West Hollywood and they used to be a guy

35
00:02:07.091 --> 00:02:10.300
that would jerk off and watched him change and that's Cim put that story in the

36
00:02:10.301 --> 00:02:13.180
show,
man.
He wanted all these little great tidbit.

37
00:02:13.181 --> 00:02:16.330
There's a great moment about jokes stealing in there and a fucking huge fist

38
00:02:16.331 --> 00:02:18.280
fight that breaks out.
That was real from gyms,

39
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.520
personal life about guys who used to come in from the fucking radio,

40
00:02:21.521 --> 00:02:24.400
from talk radio in the,
you know,
in the morning they come to the club at night,

41
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.190
come to the store,
steal shit.
The next morning comics would fucking hear it.
Yeah.

42
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.300
That's a real common thing.
Yeah,
man.
Right.

43
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.490
<v 1>That was always going on.
You know what else was going on?
A big one was,
uh,</v>

44
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.100
writers for sitcoms would come.
Yup.
Same Shit.

45
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.790
And they would watch people do sets and then they would wind up putting their,

46
00:02:39.791 --> 00:02:42.730
their bits and like even in fucking Seinfeld,
Kevin,

47
00:02:42.731 --> 00:02:46.630
when Kevin James Signature bits got used on Seinfeld after he had a bunch of

48
00:02:46.631 --> 00:02:51.160
meetings and then they came to see him perform a bunch of like top writers came

49
00:02:51.161 --> 00:02:55.420
to see him performing an NBC showcase this like when Kevin was getting a

50
00:02:55.421 --> 00:03:00.040
development deal and they came down and watched him and then like the next,
his

51
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.570
<v 0>muffin bit was on a Seinfeld episode and he was like,
what the fuck man?</v>

52
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.180
Well nowadays they fucking,
they're blatant.
They tell you like I,

53
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:10.450
I tested for Saturday night live and you sign a form that says these characters

54
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:15.160
can be used after the audition.
Whoa.
And this is crazy.

55
00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:17.710
I'm not calling out anybody or saying anything,
but they did.

56
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:20.830
There was a character ended up on the show that Vanessa Bayer did fucking

57
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.530
hilariously,
that I did something similar in my edition.
I was like,
damn,

58
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:26.330
that was really good.
It's winning me.
You so you,
you audition,

59
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.850
you have a character you audition with.
Yeah.
I did this character,

60
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.440
this fake work deals that they own that now when you audition,

61
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:34.690
you surrender the character.
Fuck you man.
Yeah.

62
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:36.370
You signed a piece of paper when it's crazy.

63
00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:38.470
They're not even giving you money and they're stealing your idea.

64
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.220
Then when you get that,
that's the respect that,
uh,

65
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.140
the SNL has earned in the,
in that community who,
you know,

66
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.670
you don't have that respect.
It's crazy.
That's stealing.
You're stealing.
Well,

67
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:51.880
I signed the form,
man.
Oh my God.
Dude,
that's so awful.

68
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.760
I signed that sheet because of the May,
cause you can almost taste it.
You know,

69
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.120
they're making you sign something saying we're going to steal from you.
Totally.

70
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.930
That's insane.
We're going to steal from you.
We're not going to pay you anything.

71
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.010
We're going to use this thing.

72
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.280
It might be a fucking Mike Meyers movie someday and you'd have to say,
yes sir.

73
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.140
May I have another take it and take gas.
Can I dig it?
It's so crazy.

74
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.810
I took it,
man.
I took it.
It was a wild process,

75
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.800
but the fact that some she usually successful business wouldn't want to

76
00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:21.220
compensate people for creating those ideas to fly you out to,

77
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.220
to show yourself off in a few.

78
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.460
I mean even if you just don't hire them but you liked that character,

79
00:04:27.461 --> 00:04:30.670
you there should be like an established rate that you have to pay for things.

80
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.560
But I mean not you don't,
and my whole thing is like,

81
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.720
I'm not saying what they did was what I did,
but it was,

82
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.320
there was some similarities in the nuances of the character that I thought were

83
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.900
either just a confluence of great ideas,
but um,
it is hard.

84
00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:47.650
You think about that stuff.
You're like,
man,
is that close to what I did?

85
00:04:47.651 --> 00:04:50.020
Because you know,
like we said back in the day,
like our show shows,

86
00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:51.180
people were blatantly steal.

87
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.800
People have been blatantly stealing in comedy for fucking ever.

88
00:04:53.801 --> 00:04:55.330
It's been like the beginning of time,

89
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.410
and especially in the 70s which I think is what we tried to show was like they

90
00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:03.340
would steal these radio guys and fucking show up again and be like,
hey,

91
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.570
like it was like it happen on buddy told him that that was one of your shit

92
00:05:07.571 --> 00:05:11.350
jokes from last night.
We always,
we always promote you.
You ever,
you're in town.

93
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.213
Yeah.

94
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.290
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
