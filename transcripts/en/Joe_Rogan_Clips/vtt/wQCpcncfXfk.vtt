1
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.450
The joe rogan experience.
Oh,
nice.
Right.

2
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.130
I watched star wars today.
How was it?
I'm it.

3
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.200
It was like a Disney star wars movie.
Yeah.

4
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.020
Everything's super diversified.
The characters are all black and Asian women,

5
00:00:17.021 --> 00:00:21.420
and there's women that are generals.
The women are running things.
It's like,
yeah,

6
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.050
that's awesome.
Yeah,
it's a game of Thrones.
It,
no,
no,
no.
Ooh.

7
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.530
Little after the bell action there.
It just,
it was okay.
I was like,

8
00:00:29.531 --> 00:00:32.470
get off as a fun movie.
It was fun,
but it was like,

9
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.110
it's like it got dignified.

10
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.580
It's like they just boiled all the bacteria off again,

11
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.470
Marxist Marxist file.
It's just,
it's just,
you know,
it's,
I don't,

12
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.630
I like a strong female character,

13
00:00:46.631 --> 00:00:51.631
but I don't want to think that this is like a calculated move for you to create

14
00:00:51.941 --> 00:00:54.610
a strong female care,
but it is capped because you want,

15
00:00:54.611 --> 00:00:57.610
but I don't want to to notice that.
I know.
Do you know what I'm saying?

16
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.600
Somebody told me that about the black mirror somebody could play.
They said,
oh,

17
00:01:01.601 --> 00:01:04.600
all the fucking heroes in this season's black mirror.
All women.

18
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.020
Like if you watch the black mirror and that's what you're concentrating on

19
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.120
Europe asshole.
Yeah.
Is that fucking shows amazing.
It's astonishing.

20
00:01:13.121 --> 00:01:17.110
Nobody gives a fuck if does the lead or men who lead.

21
00:01:17.111 --> 00:01:19.810
It's just a phenomenal,
shows me anxiety.

22
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.110
I want to turn it off halfway through mine.
I haven't seen this with me anymore.

23
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.950
I haven't seen the season though.
I haven't seen this seasons.
The greatest ever.

24
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.570
It's amazing.
It's amazing.
It's amazing.
Head metal,
heavy metal dog.
Crazy.

25
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.220
All right,
here we go.
Why don't you,

26
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.990
<v 1>okay.</v>
