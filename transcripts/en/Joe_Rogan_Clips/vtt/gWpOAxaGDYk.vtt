00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.670
There's also that plume being in the air,

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.700
which restricted flying is all tied into the death of that journalist Michael

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.580
Hastings.
Do you know that?
Oh,
that crazy conspiracy theory.

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.200
It's one of the weirder ones,
man.
It's one of the weirder ones.
This guy,

5
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.400
Michael Hastings was this sort of renegade journalist type character and he went

6
00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:23.590
to Iraq or Afghanistan,
um,

7
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.880
I wanna say Iraq,
but it might've been Afghanistan.

8
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.910
He went there with the troops and he got stuck there because of that volcano.

9
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.700
So because was stuck there,

10
00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:39.630
everybody got comfortable with him being around and they started saying crazy

11
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:40.290
shit.

12
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.240
They start joking around about Obama or stuff like that and he put all this in

13
00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:47.820
the article and when he put all this in the article,

14
00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:51.180
the general had to resign and he was like one of the most popular at most

15
00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:52.830
powerful generals in the army.

16
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.190
Then shortly thereafter,

17
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.170
homeboy decided to go 120 miles an hour down sunset slam into a tree and his car

18
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.280
exploding and everybody's like,
it's a fucking murder.

19
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.190
Hits assassination.
And then there was all these tech guys,

20
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.960
they were coming out and they were saying,
listen,

21
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.990
you abso lutely can hack a car and change the direction.

22
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.930
Change the the what?
What?
The car does take control of the car.

23
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:22.590
You absolutely can do that.
And they were like,
abs.
Absolutely.
He was like,

24
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.700
absolutely.
It absolutely 100% you do it.
Do you have,

25
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.570
we know these people,
there's videos of people falling asleep and their Teslas,

26
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.480
right?
The car just drives you there.
You get on the highway,
just drives you.

27
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.070
We know that's real.
It turns,
it'll turn,
it'll make turns for you.
It'll park.

28
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.190
They have cars that park.
You don't think that they can,

29
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.120
that they figured out a long time ago say,

30
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.480
wouldn't it be cool if we could just tap into that and make this motherfucker

31
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.760
drive into a tree on Star Hill?

32
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.400
Didn't they would be so incompetent that I don't want to hear any conspiracy

33
00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:57.120
theories ever again because of the government didn't look at that stuff.

34
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.670
If the government like this s assens didn't look at that and go,
blah,
blah,
blah,

35
00:02:00.671 --> 00:02:01.530
blah,
blah.
Hold on a second.

36
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.250
So you're telling me if the head of Isis is in a car and it's a Mercedes,

37
00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:08.580
we can hack into that car and make that motherfucker drive off a cliff.

38
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.920
We can do that.
Okay,
well let's do that.

39
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.260
I'm fucking a hundred percent those people all day or trying to figure out way

40
00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:19.020
to kill bad guys.
You don't think they would think of that?
Of course they would.

41
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.210
So that's the scary thought.

42
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.470
But then the other possibility is homeboy was losing his mind because of the

43
00:02:25.471 --> 00:02:30.240
pressure,
which is entirely possible.
He always have to like look at everything.

44
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.140
You got to look at all sides.
You really do.
It's so,

45
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.180
it's so easy to just pick a side on any story or a conspiracy theory or eat

46
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.870
anything.
Even a political opinion.
So easy to just dig your heels in.

47
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.730
But in this one,
he got to look at this guy.

48
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.330
They definitely found amphetamines in his system.
They said,

49
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.330
and that's not uncommon for writers.

50
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.850
Writers love Adderall if fucking love it.

51
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.230
Apparently I have a friend who's a journalist,

52
00:02:56.231 --> 00:03:00.370
says everybody who's a journalist is on Adderall.
Obviously he's exaggerating.

53
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.150
The one guy's out there like,
no folk,
not fucking mood,

54
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.250
but um,
who was it that was a doc?
Oh,

55
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.030
my friend Doctor Rati Mckee,
the,

56
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:15.100
the stem cell doctor from Vegas.

57
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.970
He was telling me about people that were taken Adderall,

58
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.840
like when he was in college.
And he's like,
Holy Shit,
it's my breath smell.

59
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.700
See throws me Listerine.
Press trips.
Okay,
dude,
I'll fucking take one.

60
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.790
Finally flipped it cry.
