00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.480
Hello Freak bitches.
Yeah.

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.510
I don't want to know how much of that his anxiety is dependent or caused by

3
00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:13.410
inflammation.
W they just had some great studies that we're looking at,

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.090
uh,
alterations in Gut microbiome and inflammatory status and depression and

5
00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:19.740
anxiety.
And it was basically,

6
00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:22.950
if they shifted things such that the gut microbiome looked healthier,

7
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.160
the depression anxiety basically disappeared.
And then,
you know,

8
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:27.480
it could shift the other way.

9
00:00:27.481 --> 00:00:30.450
And it's interesting again where if you had something,

10
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.930
so not everybody's going to change her diet and,

11
00:00:32.931 --> 00:00:35.700
and like I advocate for that and push and shove,

12
00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:37.650
but the reality is like our world,

13
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.980
it's set up and incentivize to not do that.

14
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:44.040
Like the big junk food manufacturers,

15
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.170
they study how to make this stuff addictive.

16
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:49.680
Like what's the Lay's potato chip line?
Yeah,
but you can't eat just one.
You know,

17
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.510
I was like,
I'll take that thing to the bank all,

18
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:55.890
all day long so you can ridicule people,
uh,
fat shame,

19
00:00:55.891 --> 00:00:56.520
do all this stuff.

20
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.350
But there's a reality that our modern world is set up to work exactly against

21
00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:03.960
our genetics.
So what do we do then?
Well,

22
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:07.230
you could have something like CBD oil where you put it in a little bite of

23
00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:10.860
chocolate and the person has it one or two times a day or whatever the dosing

24
00:01:10.861 --> 00:01:14.670
regimen is and maybe it puts her ulcerative colitis and remission.

25
00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:18.930
Maybe their depression is gone and then maybe if we get them moving in a good

26
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:22.080
direction and they don't feel like shit,
then maybe we can say,
okay,

27
00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:24.060
let's now get some diet changes in there.

28
00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:26.850
Let's get you going to bed earlier if you are going to stay up and work,

29
00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:30.120
put on some blue blockers.
So it doesn't mess with your sleep patterns as much,

30
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:33.930
but it's a really accessible,
inexpensive,

31
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.210
a no risk proposition that could add some really huge benefits for people.
Yeah,

32
00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:40.830
I think that what you said too,

33
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:44.910
that this system is sort of set up to get people to eat these crappy foods and

34
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.140
make them incredibly available and very difficult to pass up.

35
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.140
And once you start eating them,
you consume on a daily basis,

36
00:01:52.141 --> 00:01:54.630
your body starts craving them.
You get addicted to them.

37
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.940
I was at the supermarket the other day and uh,

38
00:01:56.941 --> 00:02:00.450
I was under the influence and I was always wandering through the aisles.

39
00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:04.470
It was one of those weird moments where I went,
is this always been like this?

40
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.450
I was just looking at these cans of food,
everything's can write.

41
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.640
And I was thinking,
this is all food,
but it can last forever.

42
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.160
And like food's not supposed to last forever.

43
00:02:14.161 --> 00:02:17.280
The whole idea is supposed to grow it.
You take it out of the ground,
it's alive,

44
00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:18.570
you eat it and then you're healthy.

45
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.220
And then I was looking at this food that was like,

46
00:02:21.221 --> 00:02:26.221
it's just filled with preservatives and canned and these packages and plastic

47
00:02:26.611 --> 00:02:28.550
bags of it.
And I was like,
this is so,

48
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.210
it's so strange that this is the prevalent food because it's so easy to store.

49
00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:35.880
It's so easy to ship.
It's so easy to have for sale.

50
00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:40.770
You put a bar code on the package and you're good to go.
But this is not really,

51
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.110
I mean you can eat it,
it's Food Kinda,
right?
But it's not really food,
right?
Food.

52
00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:47.520
The real food is on the edges.

53
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.360
The real food is where the vegetables are and where the meats are and where the

54
00:02:51.361 --> 00:02:53.340
eggs are.
That stuff in the middle.

55
00:02:53.341 --> 00:02:57.100
And those aisles where he just sees bright colored cans,
they would,

56
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.650
it was so weird.
It was like a little toy store,
right?
Like,

57
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.400
cause I was high so I was wandering through the hot dog,
the island.

58
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.920
I'm looking at all these different colors on me.
This is so weird.

59
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:10.921
It's like trying to draw me in with smiley faces on the cans and on the plastic

60
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:14.130
bags.
But it's,
we,

61
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.610
unless you're going to a really good natural food store,

62
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.000
you're probably inundated with that stuff.
If you go to the,

63
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.150
as a regular Vons and just walked down the aisle,
man,

64
00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:29.420
you're going to get hit with so much of this shit.
Right.
And it,
it's um,

65
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.950
it's interesting because the folks that make these foods,

66
00:03:33.951 --> 00:03:37.880
they study neurophysiology,
they study evolutionary biology,

67
00:03:37.881 --> 00:03:41.720
they study how to make things addictive.
So it's kind,
kinda funny.

68
00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:45.470
On the one hand,
we're like the gatekeepers,
the medical establishment,

69
00:03:45.471 --> 00:03:46.460
and a lot of the media,

70
00:03:46.461 --> 00:03:49.910
if you talk about like this ancestral health template or what have you there,

71
00:03:49.911 --> 00:03:52.820
there's still a bunch of like pissing match and contention around that.

72
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.600
Whereas the people who are making these foods addictive,
they fully get it.

73
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.330
But they're using it in such a way that the like,
okay,

74
00:03:59.331 --> 00:04:02.150
here's our predilection to eat more and move less.

75
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.770
Here's how we're going to make that happen.

76
00:04:03.771 --> 00:04:07.100
And we have these really interesting flavor combinations and different

77
00:04:07.101 --> 00:04:11.450
experiences.
And did,
do you want to,
do you want to run that,
that video?

78
00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:16.250
So here's a really interesting example of this,
um,
where you know,

79
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.730
you could get bored of even a really tasty food,

80
00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.540
but then you can figure out a way to bypass this whole process.

81
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:25.743
<v 1>I,
this</v>

82
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.540
strategy works and I resumed my epic ice cream back.

83
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.980
<v 0>Okay,
so what,
what's going on there?
Is Andrew Zimmerman or,
or no,
Adam,
Rick man,</v>

84
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.470
man versus food.

85
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.240
He does these eating challenges and he's in this thing called the kitchen sink

86
00:04:47.241 --> 00:04:50.000
challenge.
It's an eight pound ice cream Sundae.

87
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.070
And I think anybody would would say that an ice cream Sundae is pretty tasty.

88
00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.460
You know,
and it's hyper palatable like it would make you want to eat it.

89
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.080
But what happens to him is he gets completely bogged down in this process and

90
00:05:03.081 --> 00:05:07.100
can't go on until he orders a plate of extra salty,

91
00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.540
extra crunchy French fries.
So he's actually gagging on the ice cream,

92
00:05:11.541 --> 00:05:13.760
can't go on,
he's not going to win this thing.

93
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.950
And the way that he gets out of this situation is by eating more food.

94
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.380
He would not have finished the Sunday were it not for eating the French fries.

95
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.160
And so you have this situation where we're in,

96
00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:31.730
are woven into our genetics is this process called palate fatigue where even if

97
00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:34.010
we have a really tasty food in front of us,

98
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.670
we will get bored of it and then we'll want something else.

99
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.930
And if you have that other thing that something else immediately available and

100
00:05:41.931 --> 00:05:44.690
it's different enough from the thing that you just got bored with,

101
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.080
you can eat more in total.
And it's just so interesting.

102
00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:52.820
Like he would have failed eating this ice cream sundae where it just the Sunday,

103
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.930
but not only did he eat the Sunday,
he ate probably about 1500 calories,

104
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.230
extra salty,
extra crunchy French fries.
How did he know?

105
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.270
Did someone explain that to them?
So if you go to professional eating websites,

106
00:06:05.271 --> 00:06:09.760
like people who go do these things where they like eat hot dogs and whatever.

107
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.550
Yeah,
competitive eater.
There are pairings.
So it's like,
okay.

108
00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:17.330
So with hot dogs you need something like gummy bears because the hot dogs are

109
00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:19.310
salty and media new mommy.

110
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.490
So you need something kind of sweet and fruity and light.

111
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.420
And so there are all these pairings that you do.
And so with ice cream,

112
00:06:26.421 --> 00:06:30.050
because it's cold,
creamy,
sweet,

113
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.200
the perfect compliment to it is this salty,

114
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.910
crunchy Umami that you get out of the,
uh,
the French fries.
That's fascinating.

115
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.220
You know,
I've always found that if I'm eating,

116
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.750
I'm eating something and it's really good,
like a steak or something and um,
I,

117
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.990
I'm stuffed.
Even if I don't want any more of the steak.

118
00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:51.740
If I have fries and I taste those salty fries,
I'll start eating more fries.

119
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.240
But I know I'm full ride my stuffing,
my fat face with these stupid fries.
It's,

120
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.510
it's that novelty.
And from an evolutionary biology perspective,

121
00:06:59.511 --> 00:07:00.890
it's great wiring.

122
00:07:00.891 --> 00:07:04.820
It's great engineering because we didn't have guaranteed food all the time.

123
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.360
You know like you had to eat when you could get it and then you know you might

124
00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:10.970
go a long period of time without having that food.

125
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.300
But now we're in this situation where you have infinite variety.

126
00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:18.350
There's 50,000 different food,
like items in s average supermarket.

127
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.340
It's 10 or 11,000 new food type items that are released each year.

128
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.880
They're engineered to be hyper palatable to bypass the neuro regulation of

129
00:07:25.881 --> 00:07:26.714
appetite.

130
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.440
And it's super easy to just go fill up your pantry with the wide assortment of

131
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:31.190
these things.

132
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:35.540
So then you can do what he ended up doing here you can eat one meal,

133
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.330
know like man,
a little sweet thing would be really good.

134
00:07:38.331 --> 00:07:40.550
And so you have that sweet thing and then Gosh,

135
00:07:40.551 --> 00:07:43.310
a little salty crunchy would be nice.
And so you have the salty,

136
00:07:43.311 --> 00:07:46.870
crunchy and you can just keep eating through this whole process.
And it,

137
00:07:46.871 --> 00:07:51.871
it really makes most of the standard like dietetics recommendation of,

138
00:07:52.011 --> 00:07:54.770
you know,
eat less,
move more,
everything in moderation.

139
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.240
There's no moderation in that environment.
Like it doesn't exist.

140
00:07:59.241 --> 00:08:01.910
It's a hookers and cocaine experience,
you know what I mean?

141
00:08:01.911 --> 00:08:05.270
It's like these things spin the dopamine centers in the brain.

142
00:08:05.271 --> 00:08:08.000
They are addictive and,
and uh,

143
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:13.160
and if we are surprised by that process at all or feel bad about it,

144
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:14.870
it's kind of crazy.

145
00:08:14.871 --> 00:08:19.871
Like it is not your fault if you find yourself in trapped in this world of hyper

146
00:08:20.571 --> 00:08:21.321
palatable foods.

147
00:08:21.321 --> 00:08:26.321
And I don't suggest that people just rollover and expose her belly to the world,

148
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.840
you know,
let the world have its way with you.
But I understand what,
what it,

149
00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.540
why it's so difficult.
Like you should not feel guilt.

150
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.480
There shouldn't be any drama.
There should be no morality around it.
Like,

151
00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:38.660
if we just understand this is your basic biological wiring,

152
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.530
and if you understand that,
and it's not your fault,
but let's do something,

153
00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:47.450
then we can at least decouple ourselves from the emotionality and the drama and

154
00:08:47.451 --> 00:08:50.570
the guilt that we've had around this.
And we can start making some changes.

155
00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:53.360
But so many times the,
the,

156
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.590
the reason why I've heard from that,

157
00:08:55.591 --> 00:09:00.090
they peel out of some sort of a new way of eating or lifestyle is it,

158
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.030
they're motoring long.
They seem to be doing well,
and then they're like,
they're,

159
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:06.000
they're just gone.
And then you talk to them and they're like,
ah,
it's just hard.

160
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.570
It's like,
yeah,
it is hard.
But it wasn't just that it was hard.

161
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.710
They usually start getting some sort of internal dialogue where,
well,
I suck.

162
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.060
I must be weak.
I can't do it.
It's easier for that guy than it is for me.

163
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:20.280
So they bail on it.
And when I,

164
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:24.750
when I started putting this kind of spin of this evolutionary biology and this

165
00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:27.870
neuro regulation of appetite into working with people,

166
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:30.540
particularly people who had,
had difficulties with,

167
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:33.090
with eating over the long haul,
and maybe like some,
you know,

168
00:09:33.091 --> 00:09:35.340
we're relationships with food or what have you.

169
00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.000
There was like this light that went on.
They're like,
okay,
so it's not my fault.

170
00:09:39.001 --> 00:09:40.200
I'm like,
no man,
it's not your fault.

171
00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:43.620
We still need to do something and it's not necessarily going to be easy,

172
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.790
but we can do this.

173
00:09:44.791 --> 00:09:48.730
And if you aren't beating yourself up about the fact that this thing is a

174
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:49.860
difficult process,

175
00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:51.810
then we're going to be able to get a lot further down the road.

176
00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:01.250
<v 2>Okay.</v>
