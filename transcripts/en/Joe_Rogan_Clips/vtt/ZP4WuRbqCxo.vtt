1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.580
Um,
did you watch the Tom Hanks movie?

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.620
I watched 45 minutes at the Tom Hanks movie in Somalia.

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.690
In Somalia.
While you were captive?
Yeah.
Holy Shit.

4
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.510
What is that like?
Well,
I,

5
00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:19.410
so I knew that I knew Captain Phillips was going to be a movie when I left.

6
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.350
It was already clear right over.
Had already announced,

7
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.810
announced it when you left and you got to watch it when I'm Somalia.
Yeah,

8
00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:30.570
because by the time,
this is towards the end of my captivity,

9
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:33.480
I had a short wave radio,
so I was listening to the radio.

10
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.470
By the time it came out and went to the Oscars,
it was all over the BBC.

11
00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:39.540
So I knew about it.
I knew it was out.
I'm like,
okay,

12
00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:42.600
so I'm missing Kevin Phillips,
whatever.
Wonder what that's like.

13
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.860
And then one day,
all the guards got new smart phones,

14
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.320
pretty fancy smartphones,

15
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.800
and they were apparently loaded with a new collection of films and music and

16
00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:54.420
whatever to keep them occupied.

17
00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.380
One afternoon I saw two guards just completely wrapped by some sort of film on

18
00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:05.430
the phone.
And I heard some American voices and I'm wondering what this film is.

19
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.850
And finally I said,
fuck me.
That's Tom Hanks.

20
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.110
So I knew what they were watching.
And two weeks later,

21
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:16.560
one of the guards actually sh he handed me the phone and said,
you know,
Michael,

22
00:01:16.561 --> 00:01:20.280
look.
And so I saw about 45 minutes of it.
Wow.

23
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.810
And of course when he handed me the phone,

24
00:01:21.811 --> 00:01:23.970
the first thing that went through my mind is like,
okay,

25
00:01:23.971 --> 00:01:28.230
I'm going to call mom and find a way to turn down the volume and,
and,

26
00:01:28.231 --> 00:01:33.060
and call California.
Um,
and he took the phone away before I did that,

27
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.690
but I had a whole plan.
I developed a whole plan.

28
00:01:35.691 --> 00:01:39.630
And while I was watching Captain Phillips,
you know,
get on the plane in Boston,

29
00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:41.910
Logan or whatever.
Wow.

30
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.290
It was so atmospherically it was a pretty good,
pretty well done movie.

31
00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:47.460
But there were a couple of scenes.

32
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:49.740
Where is that where it just wouldn't have happened in real life?

33
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.400
I didn't watch the movie.
Yeah.
So what was a inaccurate about it?
Ah,

34
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.440
there was one scene where there was some selection of pirates on the beach,

35
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.900
so in public,
um,
and I thought,
Gosh,
how did they get that?
That's,
that's,

36
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.730
I've never even heard of that before.
And then I,

37
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.670
then I thought about it and thought and realize,
well that yeah,

38
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.600
actually wouldn't happen like that in public.

39
00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:14.250
That was just for dramatic purposes.
Um,
you know,
I was,

40
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.620
I was envious of their material at first and then every,
that's not,

41
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.400
they made that up.
Um,
so things like that,

42
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.970
but the pirates were fascinated to see people like them and in some cases

43
00:02:23.971 --> 00:02:25.560
they're friends,
um,

44
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.580
portrayed on screen and even though we all know how,
you know,

45
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.370
the movie ends very badly for Somali pirates.

46
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.260
So they knew about the story that was based on,
yeah,
no question.

47
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.041
Not only that,

48
00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:41.730
but one of them said that he was friends with one of the pirates involved and I

49
00:02:41.731 --> 00:02:45.720
believe him actually,
he had the right clan affiliation for that.
So it's,

50
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.770
it's quite possible.

51
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.160
What was it like to see them watching their story being depicted on the other

52
00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:55.350
side of the planet?
Well,
that's what was weird is that they,

53
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.830
they were so fascinated by it,
but we,
you know,

54
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.550
otherwise they didn't look necessarily like to talk about bad news for pirates

55
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.530
or hey,
you know,
like I said,

56
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:10.531
when the hostages were released or rescued in the first few days of my

57
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:16.270
captivity,
um,
I kept hearing that the hostages had been killed.

58
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.820
So they like to spin things in a,
in a good way for,
for pirates in general.

59
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:25.380
So I just would have assumed they would just ignore captain Phillips cause it

60
00:03:25.381 --> 00:03:29.820
ended so badly.
They were just fascinated.
They really were.
And what,

61
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.270
so what was daily life like for you?
Like you,
you ate with them?
Well,

62
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.370
I separately,
but sometimes in the same room.
They,

63
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.470
they made very bad food,

64
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.660
boiled beans and flavorless boiled goat and that kind of thing.

65
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:48.783
Um,

66
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.660
but they would eat from a communal platter sort of elsewhere within sight.

67
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.830
I didn't have to eat from the same platter as the eat by hand by hand.
Yeah.

68
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.640
Yeah.
That's a very common in that part of the world.
Yeah,

69
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:06.370
it really is because utensils just aren't,
aren't that common.

70
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.020
And they really liked spaghetti,

71
00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:10.150
so they sort of wrap the spaghetti around your fingers.

72
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:11.950
And I had done that as a free man.
You know,

73
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:16.450
I sort of sat with Somalis and ate that way.
But as a,

74
00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:21.340
as a hostage,
I was in no mood to be that,
you know,
that friendly.
Yeah.

75
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.370
They gave me a fork and I could eat my on my own.

76
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.950
So how,

77
00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:30.330
like what kind of physical state where you in after two and a half years of
this?

78
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.320
Yeah,
it was pretty bad.
I was my,
um,

79
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.740
my immune system started to fall apart,

80
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.890
so I don't go into detail too much about this in the book,

81
00:04:38.891 --> 00:04:43.891
but I had a staph infection and my skin and some other kind of infection in my

82
00:04:44.711 --> 00:04:48.580
ear and I was just something in my lungs.
I was just not very,

83
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.320
I was sick.
Um,
and I was sick constantly for several months before I got out.

84
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.210
So I knew something had really changed,

85
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.480
and I think the pirates were aware of that too.
Slowly.

86
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.010
I think they're probably possibly contributed to them lowering your ransom.

87
00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:06.580
Possibly,
but,
but I,
you know,

88
00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.700
not that they were sympathetic,
but,
uh,

89
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.800
it's possible they saw me sort of reaching,
reaching my physical limit slowly.

90
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.970
Yeah.
Slowly.
