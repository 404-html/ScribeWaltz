1
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.330
Yeah.
But let's talk about learning to code.
Right?
And,

2
00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.080
and why are people being suspended for ta,
tweeting Hashtag learn to code?

3
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.930
<v 1>Yup.
We did some research on this.
Yes,
we did some research on us.
Um,</v>

4
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.090
so there was a situation,

5
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.150
I guess about a month ago or so where a number of journalists or receiving a

6
00:00:20.751 --> 00:00:25.430
variety of tweets,
um,
some containing a learn to code,

7
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.720
some containing a bunch of other um,

8
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.250
coded language that was wishes of harm.

9
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.940
And these were thousands and thousands of tweets being directed at a handful of

10
00:00:34.941 --> 00:00:39.190
journalists.
And we did some research and what we found was,
uh,

11
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.650
a number of the accounts that we're engaging in this behavior,

12
00:00:42.651 --> 00:00:45.890
which is tweeting at the journalist with this either learn to code or things

13
00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:49.420
like day of the rope and other coded language.
Uh,

14
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.890
we're actually ban of Asian accounts.

15
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.380
That means accounts that have been previously suspended.

16
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.790
And we also learned that there was a targeted campaign being organized off our

17
00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:02.180
platform to abuse and harass these journalists.
That's not true.

18
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.710
<v 0>Does he see,
here's the thing,
an activist who works for NBC wrote to that story.</v>

19
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:08.730
And then lobbied to you,

20
00:01:08.731 --> 00:01:12.030
you issued an official statement and then even the editor and chief of the daily

21
00:01:12.031 --> 00:01:15.090
caller got a suspension for tweeting,
learned Dakota the day at the daily show.

22
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.900
<v 1>So I have never talked to anybody from NBC about this issue.
Right,</v>

23
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.960
<v 0>right.
But there were no,
so they reported don't misrepresent me.</v>

24
00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:24.900
They report it at the narrative goes far and wide amongst your circles.

25
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.900
Then all of a sudden you're seeing a high profile conservatives tweeting a joke,

26
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:28.770
getting suspensions.

27
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.740
<v 1>So again,
some of these tweets actually contained,
um,</v>

28
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.980
death threats,
wishes of harm,

29
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.370
other coded language that we've seen to mean a death to journalists.

30
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.750
So it wasn't about just the learn to code,
it was about the context.

31
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.720
<v 0>Queerness is not true.
That's just not true.</v>

32
00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:51.840
The editor in chief of the daily caller was suspended for tweeting nothing but

33
00:01:51.841 --> 00:01:52.980
Hashtag learned to code,

34
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.380
<v 1>sir.
Tim,
can I,
can I finish what I'm saying?
Yeah.</v>

35
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.050
So we were looking at the context and what was happening is there were

36
00:01:59.051 --> 00:02:02.410
journalists receiving hundreds of tweets.
So I'm had death threats,

37
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.630
some had wishes of harm,
some just learn to code.

38
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.330
And in that particular context we made a decision,

39
00:02:07.331 --> 00:02:09.970
we consider this this type of behavior about dog piling,

40
00:02:09.971 --> 00:02:14.260
which is when all of a sudden individuals are getting tons and tons of tweets at

41
00:02:14.261 --> 00:02:16.520
them.
They feel very abused or harassed on the plan.

42
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.830
<v 0>We pause this for super confusing.
For people who don't know the context,</v>

43
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.120
the learn to code thing is in response to people saying that people that are

44
00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:28.530
losing their jobs like coal miners and truck drivers and things like that could

45
00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:30.480
learn to code.
This was,

46
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.540
it was almost like ingest initially or if it wasn't ingest initially it was so

47
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:40.080
poorly thought out as a suggestion that pizza started mocking it,
right?
Correct.

48
00:02:40.081 --> 00:02:40.800
So that's correct.

49
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.940
The first stories that came out were simply like Ken miners learn to code or

50
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.130
there was no coal miners.
Right,
and they'll,

51
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.510
they'll hashtag learn to code is just a meme.

52
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.030
It's not even necessarily a conservative one that you will see more

53
00:02:51.031 --> 00:02:54.510
conservatives using.
It was people are using it to mark how stupid.

54
00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:58.400
The idea of taking a person who's on an educated as in their 50s who should our

55
00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.950
learn some new

56
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.420
<v 2>form of vocation.
And then someone says,
learn to code.
And so then other people,</v>

57
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:07.600
when they're losing their job or when something's happening,
people would write,

58
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:09.700
learn to code because it's a meme.

59
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.610
<v 0>Well,
not,
not even necessarily.
I would,
I would just characterize,</v>

60
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:17.530
learn to code as a meme that represents the elitism of modern journalists and

61
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:21.260
how they target certain communities with disdain.
Okay.
So,
so to,

62
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.040
to make that point,

63
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.700
there are people who have been suspended for tweeting something.
Like,

64
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.920
I'm not too happy with how,
you know,

65
00:03:26.921 --> 00:03:28.960
buzzfeed reported the story Hashtag learned to code,
right?

66
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.490
Making representation of these people are snooty elites who live in ivory
towers.

67
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.340
But uh,
but,
but again,
you know,

68
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.640
this is a meme that has nothing to do with harassment,
but you know,
it's,

69
00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:41.620
some people might be harassing,
somebody might tweet it.

70
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.170
Why would we expect to see,
even still today,

71
00:03:44.171 --> 00:03:46.240
I'm still getting messages from people with screenshots saying I've been

72
00:03:46.241 --> 00:03:50.500
suspended for using a Hashtag and the editor in chief of the daily caller,
right?

73
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.210
He,
he,
he,
he,
he took,
he quote,

74
00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:55.810
tweeted a video from the daily show with Hashtag learn to code and he got a

75
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:56.644
suspension for it.

76
00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.740
<v 2>So why,
why learn to code?
Why is that alone?
So</v>

77
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.210
<v 1>gracias.
And I don't think it is so egregious.</v>

78
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.710
So is it just something that got stuck in an algorithm?
A No,
it was a,
again,

79
00:04:07.711 --> 00:04:10.170
a specific set of issues that we were seeing,
um,

80
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.080
targeting a very specific set of journalists.

81
00:04:13.081 --> 00:04:16.860
And it wasn't just the learn to code,
it was a couple of things going on.

82
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.550
A lot of the accounts tweeting learn to code word ban invaders,

83
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.270
which means that curiously been suspended.

84
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.870
A lot of the accounts had other language in them are of tweets that other

85
00:04:24.871 --> 00:04:28.110
language like day of the brick day of the rope oven ready.

86
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.610
These are all coded meanings for violence against people,
right?

87
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.550
And so,
and the people who are receiving this,

88
00:04:35.551 --> 00:04:40.200
we're receiving hundreds of these and what appeared to us to be a coordinated

89
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.340
harassment campaign.

90
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.940
And so we were trying to understand the context of what was going on and take

91
00:04:44.941 --> 00:04:47.370
action on them.
Because again,
I don't know,
Joe,

92
00:04:47.371 --> 00:04:50.580
if you've ever been the target of a dog piling event on Twitter,

93
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.140
but it is not particularly fun when thousands of people or hundreds of people

94
00:04:55.141 --> 00:04:57.540
are tweeting at you and saying things.

95
00:04:57.541 --> 00:05:00.240
And that's can be viewed as a form of harassment.

96
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.010
It's not about the individual tweet.

97
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.710
It is about the volume of things that are being directed at don't understand.

98
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.570
And so in that particular case we made the judgment call and it is a judgment

99
00:05:09.571 --> 00:05:14.571
call to take down the tweets that were responding directly to these journalists

100
00:05:16.321 --> 00:05:20.130
that were saying learn to code even if they didn't have a wish of harm

101
00:05:20.131 --> 00:05:24.300
specifically attached to them because of what we viewed as coordinated attempt,

102
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.240
uh,
to harass them.
And again,
like I was saying,

103
00:05:27.241 --> 00:05:31.020
some of the other signals and coded language and we were worried that learn to

104
00:05:31.021 --> 00:05:36.021
code was taking on a different meaning in that particular context.

105
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.910
<v 2>So but in and of itself though,</v>

106
00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:44.410
it still seems like there's alternative meanings to learn to code.

107
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.030
It still could be used as Tim was saying to mark a lip,
you know,
elite,

108
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.040
snooty speak truth to power.
Yes,
absolutely.
I agree

109
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.311
<v 1>with you.</v>

110
00:05:52.311 --> 00:05:55.850
So it's really about the context of what was happening in that situation and all

111
00:05:55.851 --> 00:05:58.010
those other things.
I think in a very

112
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.130
<v 0>different situation we would not take action on that.
Okay.</v>

113
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.440
But does not seem like your,

114
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.160
you're throwing a blanket over a very small issue.

115
00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.000
I think learned to code in itself is very small.

116
00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:15.090
The blanket is cast over racism,
the blanket is cast over this,
all,

117
00:06:15.091 --> 00:06:17.330
all the other horrible things that are attached to it,

118
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.820
but the horrible things that are attached to it,
the real issue,

119
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.620
this learn to code thing is kind of a legitimate protest in people saying that

120
00:06:24.621 --> 00:06:27.080
these minors should learn to code.
That's kind of preposterous.

121
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.560
The first articles weren't mean.
It was just,
it learned to code,

122
00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:31.610
kind of identified.

123
00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:35.270
You have these journalists who are so far removed from Middle America that they

124
00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:38.120
think you can take a 50 year old man who's never used a computer before and put

125
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:41.150
them in the stories I think were legitimate.
Yes.

126
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.760
But the point more so it as it was a meme,

127
00:06:43.761 --> 00:06:48.620
the Hashtag the idea of learning to code condenses this idea and it's easy to

128
00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:49.250
communicate,

129
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.700
especially when you only have 280 characters that there is a class of
individual,

130
00:06:52.701 --> 00:06:56.090
this country,
I think you mentioned on,
uh,
was it Sam Harris that the left,

131
00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.750
the left liberal journalists only follow each other in the,

132
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.340
in the run up to the 25th,
2016 elections.
Yeah.
And so,
uh,
I mean I,

133
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.860
I still believe that to be true and I've worked in these offices.

134
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.800
It has changed that they've done this study.
Again,

135
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.970
the visualization and another is a lot more cross pollination.
But we'd,

136
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.350
what we saw is,
uh,

137
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.360
folks who are portraying on the left end of the spectrum mainly followed folks

138
00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:17.930
on the left.

139
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.590
And folks on the right fold everyone what you were talking about earlier,

140
00:07:21.591 --> 00:07:23.350
that there's is bubbles,
there's,

141
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:27.490
there's bubbles and we've helped create them and maintain them.
So,

142
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.320
so here's what ends up happening and this is one of the big problems that people

143
00:07:30.321 --> 00:07:32.420
have with this story.
Particularly,

144
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.050
particularly you have a left wing activist who works for NBC News.

145
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.840
I'm not accusing you of having read the article.
He writes,
he,
he's,

146
00:07:38.841 --> 00:07:43.070
he spends a like a day lobbying to Twitter saying,
guys,
you have to do this.

147
00:07:43.071 --> 00:07:44.030
You have to make these changes.

148
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.720
The next day he writes a story saying that four Chan is organizing these,
these,

149
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.580
these harassment campaigns and death threats.

150
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.430
And while four Chan was doing threads about it,

151
00:07:52.431 --> 00:07:54.380
you can't accuse fortune simply for talking about it cause you're right,

152
00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:58.580
it was talking about it too as what's Twitter.
So then the next day he,

153
00:07:58.581 --> 00:07:59.690
after he published his article,

154
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:04.280
now he's getting threats and then Twitter issues a statement saying we will take

155
00:08:04.281 --> 00:08:08.260
action.
And to make matters worse.
When John Levine,
a writer for the rap,

156
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.780
got a statement from one of your spokespeople saying,
yes,

157
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:13.760
we are banning people for,
for saying learned to code.

158
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.490
A bunch of journalists came out and then lied.

159
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:19.100
I'd no idea why he's saying this is not true.
This is fake news.

160
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:22.250
Then a second statement was published by Twitter saying it's part of a

161
00:08:22.251 --> 00:08:26.060
harassment campaign,
and so then the mainstream narrative becomes,
oh,

162
00:08:26.061 --> 00:08:28.490
they're only banning people who are part of a harassment campaign,
but you,

163
00:08:28.491 --> 00:08:32.010
you literally see legitimate high profile individuals getting suspensions for,

164
00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:35.750
for joining in on a joke.
Oh,
they're there for sure.
Probably mistakes in there.

165
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:38.900
I don't think that any of us are claiming that we got that 100% right and

166
00:08:38.901 --> 00:08:42.350
probably our team having a lack of context and to actually what's happening as

167
00:08:42.351 --> 00:08:42.721
well and,

168
00:08:42.721 --> 00:08:47.540
and we would fully admit we probably were way too aggressive when we first saw

169
00:08:47.541 --> 00:08:50.960
this as well and made mistakes.
I hope this clarifies.

170
00:08:50.961 --> 00:08:53.420
Then you have situations like this where you can see,
you know,
the,

171
00:08:53.421 --> 00:08:54.800
this journalist,
I'm not going to name him,

172
00:08:54.801 --> 00:08:58.170
but he routinely has very like left wing,

173
00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.660
I don't want to use overtly esoteric words,
but uh,

174
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.600
intersectional dogmatic points of view,
right?
So this is considered me.

175
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:11.220
So like intersectional feminism is considered like a small ideology.

176
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:14.970
People refer to these groups as the regressive left or the identitarian left.

177
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.180
These are basically people who hold views that a person is judged based on the

178
00:09:18.181 --> 00:09:20.790
color of their skin instead of the content of their character.

179
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.070
So you have the right wing version,
which is like the alt right,

180
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:27.750
the left wing version,
which is like,
um,
intersectional feminism is,
is,

181
00:09:27.751 --> 00:09:31.620
is how simple referred to.
So you'll see people say things like,
you know,

182
00:09:31.621 --> 00:09:32.401
when they typically,

183
00:09:32.401 --> 00:09:35.760
when they rag on white men or when they say like white feminism,
these are,

184
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.970
these are signals that they hold these particular views and these things are

185
00:09:38.971 --> 00:09:39.840
becoming more pervasive.

186
00:09:39.841 --> 00:09:42.720
So what ends up happening is you have a journalist who clearly holds these
views.

187
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.830
I don't even wanna call him a journalist.

188
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.040
He writes extremely biased and out of context story,

189
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.370
Twitter takes action and response,
a seemingly and response.

190
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:54.330
Then we can look at what happens with Oliver Darcy at CNN.
He says,
you know,

191
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.940
the people at Seapak are the conservatives are gullible eating red meat from

192
00:09:56.941 --> 00:09:59.400
grifters,
among other things,
disparaging comments about the right.

193
00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:02.880
And he's the one who's primarily advocating for the removal of certain

194
00:10:02.881 --> 00:10:06.330
individuals who you then remove.
And then when Kathy Griffin calls for Doxing,

195
00:10:06.331 --> 00:10:09.830
that's fine.
When this guy calls for the death of these kids,
he gets it,

196
00:10:09.831 --> 00:10:13.080
he gets a slap on the wrist.
And I look,
I understand the context matters,

197
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.730
but grains of sand to make a heat.

198
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.090
And eventually you have all of these stories piling up and people are asking you

199
00:10:18.091 --> 00:10:20.820
why it only flows in one direction.
Cause I gotta I gotta be honest.

200
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.340
I'd imagine that calling for the death three times of any individual's abandon,

201
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:28.170
bull offense,
even without a warning,
he just get rid of him.
But it didn't happen.

202
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:31.830
Right.
We see,
we see these,
you know,
people say men aren't women though,

203
00:10:31.831 --> 00:10:32.641
and they get a suspension.

204
00:10:32.641 --> 00:10:34.910
We see people say the editor in chief of the daily caller,

205
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.590
maybe the best example hashtag learn to code a quoting the daily show and he

206
00:10:38.591 --> 00:10:39.424
gets a suspension.

207
00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.390
It's threatening death and inciting death is a suspension to it.

208
00:10:43.391 --> 00:10:45.840
If it feels like it's only going in one direction.
Yeah.

209
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:49.350
I think we have a lot of work to do to explain more clearly when we're taking

210
00:10:49.351 --> 00:10:54.110
action and why,
and certainly looking into,
um,
any mistakes we may have made.

211
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.440
And that's particularly particular situation.
