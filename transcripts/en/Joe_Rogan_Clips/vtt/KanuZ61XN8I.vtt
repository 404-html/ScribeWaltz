1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.091
Drive by day,

2
00:00:01.091 --> 00:00:05.500
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day they get caught doing something.
But

3
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.910
<v 1>yeah,
watch that.
And then,
sorry for interrupting that.</v>

4
00:00:07.911 --> 00:00:12.230
I've watched that hurt business documentary on Netflix with Danielle Carme aid,

5
00:00:12.231 --> 00:00:16.910
the fucking like whatever this knee injury and is trying to get healthy again

6
00:00:16.911 --> 00:00:21.170
and yeah,
fuck that documentary is and 10 she's got a watch.

7
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.360
It's so incredible.
Like the way,
I mean,
I almost like the focus of it is I get,

8
00:00:26.361 --> 00:00:27.290
we're going to spotlight.

9
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.220
I'd like a a number of these personalities from the UFC and really short.

10
00:00:31.221 --> 00:00:35.210
It's how fucking tragic it is.
They put so much into it and then the,
you know,

11
00:00:35.211 --> 00:00:38.420
they had their careers for whatever it's worth.

12
00:00:38.421 --> 00:00:39.980
And then when it's all said and done,

13
00:00:39.981 --> 00:00:43.310
they just got nothing to fucking show for it and it's just so fucking trash.

14
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.770
<v 0>Well,
you can't think that you're going to have something to show for it.</v>

15
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.520
That's the thing.

16
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.720
If you're lucky and you become a Conor McGregor who is like one in a million or

17
00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:55.800
you become,
you know,
a George St Pierre who retires as the champion,
you're,

18
00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:58.740
you're really,
really unusual.
But for everyone else,

19
00:00:58.741 --> 00:01:00.700
you have to do it because you love doing it of course.

20
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.270
And if you do it because you love doing it and that's what you want to do,

21
00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:06.060
then you should do it and you will bank a lot of money if you're successful.

22
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.470
But there's this thing that people have when they see a guy like Floyd

23
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.910
Mayweather and they say,
well,
hey,
boxers make millions of dollars.
Look,

24
00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:17.550
Floyd Mayweather made hundreds of millions of dollars.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

25
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.580
Floyd Mayweather makes hundreds of millions of dollars.

26
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:25.170
Not Boxers like Gennady Golovkin who was one of the best boxers in the world.

27
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.430
He can't even sell 200,000 paper views like his last paper of you by,

28
00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:34.431
I think it was like 150,000 which is insanely low to the point where it's like,

29
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.040
it's very difficult for promoters to even get behind him unless he's finding

30
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:40.800
someone like Canelo Alvarez,
which is his next fight.
Well,

31
00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:42.210
he'll make some money in that fight,

32
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.240
but guarantee you he ain't making very good money like with 150,000 paper views

33
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.880
and he's a multiple time world champion and like an fantastic amateur fighter

34
00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:54.720
and one of the best in the world.

35
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.880
It's about being a star and a promoter is not responsible to give a fighter a

36
00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:02.490
bunch of money if they're not earning a bunch of money.

37
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.970
It's a business and the business is people want to pay to see you.

38
00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:06.990
Why do they want to see you?

39
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.840
Do they want to see you because you trash talk or do they want to see you

40
00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:12.540
because you're Anderson Silva and you fight like you're in,
you're in the Matrix?

41
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.260
Or do they want to see you because you're Ronda Rousey and the first ever woman

42
00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:18.270
ass kicker that we've ever seen like this?
Well,

43
00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:20.340
whatever reason it is that they want to see you.

44
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.210
That reason is why you can make a shit ton of money.

45
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.110
It's not that you just deserve a shit ton of money because it's hard to do.

46
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.950
And that's where,
but a lot of people get that wrong in their head.

47
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.290
They get that wrong in their head.
Well it's show business,

48
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.730
but it's also athletics.
So it's a very bizarre combination of two worlds.

49
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.660
<v 1>Do you think that Karma Gregor is doing a disservice to south by putting so much</v>

50
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.610
attention on like just putting his whole UFC career on hold for this Mayweather

51
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.520
thing?

52
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.800
<v 0>No.
Um,</v>

53
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.550
because ultimately he can only fight for so long and he stands to win.

54
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.920
Like who knows how much money.
I mean he can make,

55
00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.620
it could be as much as a hundred million dollars.
The fight,

56
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.520
it's going to be insane.

57
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.420
Asking a guy to pass up on the opportunity to make $100 million is kind of
crazy.

58
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.730
That said he's fighting boxing.
No it doesn't.
No,

59
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:10.720
it doesn't matter.
It's not,

60
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.430
the way boxing works is you get a purse.
You know,

61
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.690
like the way UFC works is different and often criticized and I think rightly so

62
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.660
is that you have a wind money and a show money.

63
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.370
So say if you were going to fight Jamie and they set it up where you uh,

64
00:03:27.371 --> 00:03:28.090
you fight,

65
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.410
you make $50,000 to show and then another 50 if you win.

66
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.710
A lot of people have a real hard time with that and I think they should because

67
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.090
you're doing your best,

68
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.960
you're giving your best performance regardless of whether or not you win.

69
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.660
No one's going to fight harder,
I don't think,
at least to be,

70
00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:46.750
to get that wind bonus.
These guys are trying to win their fucking gladiators,

71
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.381
you know?

72
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:51.070
I mean I think you should have a purse and that should be what you get paid and

73
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:54.850
you fight your best and that's what you get paid.
Like this idea that you're,

74
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.390
that's double is going to,
you know,
you're going to come your way if,

75
00:03:58.391 --> 00:04:00.040
if you get the judge's nod.

76
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.160
Meanwhile the judges get shit wrong all the time and to have your future like

77
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.240
have $50,000 or 100,000 or who knows what the number is on the line due to

78
00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:12.100
someone else's interpretation of it.

79
00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:15.010
Or You can get injured and wind up losing or anything.
Had happened.

80
00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:16.390
Like I think that's kind of fucked up.

81
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.620
The thing about the Conor McGregor Floyd Mayweather fight.
If it's tennis,

82
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.070
you'd get the money if you win.
Yeah,
but that's different.
First of all,

83
00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:27.610
it's not a fight.
Okay.
Cause like you can play a tennis match every weekend.

84
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.950
Try fighting every weekend.
We'd be dead in a month.

85
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.020
You know a cure is US president.
Yeah.
They agreed to sign a deal with Floyd.

86
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.760
That doesn't mean anything because Floyd Mayweather has an agreed to it.

87
00:04:36.761 --> 00:04:40.780
The deal has been negotiated.
Connor has agreed.
So that's what that means.

88
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.320
But here's the deal.
Let's be honest about this as much as possible.

89
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.110
This is a boxing match between Conor Mcgregor,

90
00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:49.150
a guy who's never had a real professional boxing match.

91
00:04:49.151 --> 00:04:54.151
It was a really good amateur boxer in Ireland who's a real multiple division

92
00:04:54.341 --> 00:04:58.450
world champion combat sports fighter.
No doubt about that.
But,
and a striker,

93
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.690
no doubt about that.
But it's fighting one of the best boxers,

94
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.820
if not the best boxer ever.

95
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.530
Most likely does not going to work out well for him.
If you had to guess.

96
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.530
That's my honest take on it.

97
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.490
The only way it could work out well is if Floyd takes him lightly.

98
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.440
Connor clips him Connor mugs and kind of does some like old school Bernard

99
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.920
Hopkins Shit like ties him up.
Rob some up inside the clinch,

100
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.510
hits them with some real hard shots or,
or does something fucked up to them.

101
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.201
I mean who knows.

102
00:05:29.201 --> 00:05:31.450
Headbutts I mean that's where Victoria Doherty's tried to do with him.

103
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.700
I guess he can also say that,
um,
that uh,
he doesn't really stand there.
It's,

104
00:05:36.701 --> 00:05:39.960
it's win win for kinder.
Cause if he loses his,
of course he was going to lose.

105
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.080
Yeah.
And also Floyd is not a vicious puncher.

106
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.720
Floyd's not knowing.
Never was.
No,
no.
He never was.
He,

107
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.330
he is an amazing boxer,
but he is very brittle hands.

108
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.860
He breaks his hands a lot and he can knock you out like you knocked out Victoire

109
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.490
tease.
But he knocked out Victoria.
He's cause he's just standing in front of him.

110
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.190
He knocked out Ricky Hatton who was a smaller fighter,

111
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.220
but he doesn't knock out most guys.
He stuns them.

112
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:05.900
He sticks them with some hard shots,

113
00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:10.430
but conn has got a really good chin and he's a much bigger guy so the odds are

114
00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:11.990
if even if Connor gets worked,

115
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.700
he's just going to get out boxed for 12 rounds and get embarrassed and just with

116
00:06:16.701 --> 00:06:20.210
at a bunch of punches and Floyd is not going to be anywhere near him or he can

117
00:06:20.211 --> 00:06:21.044
catch him.

118
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.370
I mean it is possible that he can catch him but it's not likely like the odds

119
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.490
are going to be huge in Floyd Mayweather.
His favor.

120
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.760
If I had a gas it's we're going to be like 20 to one or something crazy like

121
00:06:31.761 --> 00:06:35.360
that.
I'm not an oddsmaker but,

122
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.380
but I do know movement and I know boxing and that just just,

123
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.290
just a big difference between what a guy like Floyd Mayweather can do and a guy

124
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:46.100
like Conor can do when it comes to the actual boxing skills.

125
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.260
But there's also,

126
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.250
there's another factor too that Connor has been fighting with small gloves and I

127
00:06:52.251 --> 00:06:53.660
was going to be fighting with larger gloves.

128
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.750
What size gloves they agree on for the fight.
If Floyd smart,

129
00:06:56.751 --> 00:06:59.480
he's going to make him fight with 10 ounce gloves,
you know,

130
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.080
cause probably Connor will want and why where eight,
I dunno what,

131
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.920
what weight class?
They have the cutoff in like lighter weight classes.

132
00:07:06.921 --> 00:07:11.390
They use eight ounce gloves and Le Heavier these 10 ounce gloves,
you know,

133
00:07:11.391 --> 00:07:11.650
that's,

134
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.960
that's like that was a stipulation in the Marvin Hagler sugar ray Leonard fight

135
00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:15.621
the sugar ray Leonard,

136
00:07:15.621 --> 00:07:18.770
one of the bigger gloves on a heavier gloves because he's fighting a big heavy

137
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:20.270
puncher like Hagler.

138
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.350
So they might make some sort of a decision to go with larger gloves.

139
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.560
But Floyd's a fucking 49 in oh multiple division world boxing champion and

140
00:07:31.991 --> 00:07:35.870
Connor has never had a professional boxing fight.
That's really what it is.

141
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.910
It's interesting.
I mean I want to see it.

142
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.030
Don't make no mistake about it when the fucking first bell rings.

143
00:07:41.031 --> 00:07:44.930
I'll have my popcorn ready,
bro.
Well you'll probably be right there.

144
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.750
I don't think so.
No,
I think I'll be home.
Yeah,

145
00:07:47.751 --> 00:07:50.630
I think it'd be watching that from home.
I think that's a,

146
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.720
whoever does commentary on that.
It's going to be probably boxing people.

147
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:57.980
It's like if you had Max Kellerman and Jim Lampley doing,
um,

148
00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.940
commentary on Floyd Mayweather fighting Conor McGregor and an MMA fight,

149
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:04.460
I think that would be an embarrassment.
That'd be ridiculous.

150
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:09.230
Just as ridiculous as it would be for me to do commentary on Connor Fighting

151
00:08:09.231 --> 00:08:10.460
Floyd in a boxing match.

152
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.440
Unless they wanted to have a combination of an MMA judge and a,

153
00:08:15.441 --> 00:08:18.950
or an MMA,
a commentator,
and a box and commentator.
Maybe.

154
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:21.950
Perhaps I would do it with Max Kellerman.
I'm a big fan of that guy,

155
00:08:21.951 --> 00:08:24.050
like that guy a lot.
I think that'd be kind of interesting,

156
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.830
but most likely I'll be at home watching it.
You know,

157
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:31.010
I'd like to see it live.
Maybe,
maybe sit ringside.

158
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.460
We'd be kind of interesting to see that.
It's going to be a crazy,

159
00:08:34.461 --> 00:08:37.130
interesting experience to see what Connor can do.

160
00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:41.960
And I know he's been working like almost exclusively on his boxing for months

161
00:08:41.961 --> 00:08:43.700
and months and months in preparation for this.

162
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.870
Here's the thing that mother fucker can put you into orbit with one punch.

163
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.610
That's a fact.
You know,

164
00:08:49.611 --> 00:08:52.130
like if you look at this past weekend is a perfect example.

165
00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:56.430
When I said I'm about Eddie Alvarez and Dustin poray having this crazy war,

166
00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:01.230
Connor new murked bolted,
those guys with one punch with,

167
00:09:01.231 --> 00:09:04.680
I mean with Eddie,
he softened him up with a few punches before he marked him,

168
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:09.950
but he had them on Queer Street with one punch and he marked Dustin Poirier with

169
00:09:10.141 --> 00:09:15.120
one punch.
I mean,
he's just,
he hits fucking hard.
This,

170
00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:19.140
this guy for Rasa hobbies,
a very famous MMA coach and he said it best.
He said,

171
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.160
Connor has a touch of death.
Like he just,
he just fucking,

172
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:24.450
he just blacks.

173
00:09:24.451 --> 00:09:29.451
Dude's in Zap some with ridiculous speed and accuracy and when he does your

174
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.133
Foxville,

175
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:35.760
the question is whether or not it can be able to do that to Floyd motherfucking

176
00:09:35.761 --> 00:09:39.870
Mayweather and most likely Ford's going to be nowhere near him when those

177
00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:42.750
punches come flying.
I mean,
he's a wizard.

178
00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:48.030
You ever watch like Floyd Mayweather defensive highlight reel when it's just him

179
00:09:48.031 --> 00:09:51.090
kind of running backwards?
No,
him just moving away from punches,

180
00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:53.580
bending at the hips.
He's not a runner.
See Fluid.

181
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.800
People think of Floyd's or runner.
Floyd doesn't run.

182
00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.860
He's not like running away from God's,
he stands right in front of Dude's.

183
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.980
He stands right in front of Dude's and maybe backs up slightly or moves to the

184
00:10:02.981 --> 00:10:03.720
side.

185
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.720
But he's just so knowledgeable when it comes to boxing and he has such a deep

186
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.750
understanding of where to be at the right time and where the punches can come

187
00:10:12.751 --> 00:10:14.340
from.
The left comes from here,

188
00:10:14.341 --> 00:10:17.550
that means a rights coming this way and he's nowhere near that.
He's over here.

189
00:10:17.551 --> 00:10:20.320
And that means after the right look like what can you stand in front of them?

190
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:25.140
You when you watch him,
the way he's able to like slide out of the way a shit.

191
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:29.040
I mean dudes just don't fucking hit him very often.

192
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:34.190
He's been hit least or less than any world champion that's had 49 fights.

193
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:40.680
I would say that he probably has the most successful defensive career and the

194
00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:43.440
history of boxing.
He's,
I mean,

195
00:10:43.441 --> 00:10:47.250
he's literally been tagged hard maybe five,

196
00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.940
six times it his entire career and he stands in front of some of the best

197
00:10:50.941 --> 00:10:54.510
fighters in the world.
Like Canelo Alvarez mean Canelo was younger then.

198
00:10:54.511 --> 00:10:57.510
It was a few years ago and Canelo wasn't as good as he is now,

199
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.380
but he just stands right in front of guys and pop them in the face and just

200
00:11:01.381 --> 00:11:03.780
understands how to move like that kind of shit.

201
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.910
Like when you're watching this highlight reel,

202
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.960
you're watching a master like young fighters.
They should,

203
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:14.970
they should watch his defensive movements and abilities I think almost above all

204
00:11:14.971 --> 00:11:18.270
others,
except now this new guy,
facility Loma Chanko,

205
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:22.740
who I think his rivals,
anybody that's ever lived in terms of his movement,

206
00:11:22.741 --> 00:11:25.500
his ability to move and his,
his positioning and footwork.

207
00:11:25.501 --> 00:11:28.350
I think he's as good as it's ever been,
but you know,

208
00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:31.620
he is only got like nine professional fights or something like that.

209
00:11:31.621 --> 00:11:32.910
He just hasn't really,

210
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:36.600
luckily this Oscar de la Hoya standard right in front of him and he can't

211
00:11:36.601 --> 00:11:40.680
fucking hit him.
He's thrown all these punches like that.
Mom won my mail Marquez,

212
00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:44.310
he pops them in.
Just swooped slides right out of the way.
Sorry.
Not here.

213
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:49.740
An unbelievable work ethic.
Like Floyd Mayweather.
We'll go to a club,

214
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:54.280
go to a nightclub in Vegas,
hang out,
drink water,
hang out with everybody,

215
00:11:54.281 --> 00:11:57.690
get all the accolades.
There's a gentleman floored bullying may,

216
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.030
whether somebody goes crazy lights,
some hundred dollar bills.
Dan,

217
00:12:02.031 --> 00:12:05.380
you know what he does?
People will drive his Rolls Royce and he'll run,

218
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:09.220
he'll run the Vegas strip but run miles and then go to the gym three o'clock in

219
00:12:09.221 --> 00:12:13.900
the morning and do fucking 15 rounds in the heavy bag.
He's an animal.
I mean his,

220
00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:17.230
his work ethic and his mind and his determination and focus.

221
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.620
And I guarantee you man,
if he's getting ready for,

222
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:23.710
for Floyd Mayweather is getting ready for um,
Conor McGregor.

223
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.990
He's got to be in tip top shape again man.
He's not,

224
00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:29.170
he's never going to come in and slept in.
It's going to be fun.

225
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.410
But why is he got to be so such a Dick?
Yeah,

226
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.550
cause that's how I made all that money.

227
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.520
It's because we were talking about before.
Like what it like a show business,

228
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:41.440
the show business aspect of it is having Pete like he used to be pretty boy

229
00:12:41.441 --> 00:12:44.890
Floyd Mayweather.
That's the eastern calm but it wasn't really making any money.

230
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:45.611
You know,

231
00:12:45.611 --> 00:12:49.690
he became rich when he became Floyd money Mayweather when he started talking all

232
00:12:49.691 --> 00:12:52.390
this shit and then people want him to get his ass kicked and he wasn't getting

233
00:12:52.391 --> 00:12:54.580
his ass kicked.
Like people paying to see him.

234
00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.100
Not necessarily because they like it,

235
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.860
they're paying to see him cause they want to see him get fucked up cause he's a

236
00:12:59.861 --> 00:13:04.840
huge star and it became a huge star by fucking with people talking a lot of

237
00:13:04.841 --> 00:13:05.500
shit.

238
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:09.520
Talking about how great he is showing all of his watches and all this jewelry

239
00:13:09.521 --> 00:13:13.580
and all.
He's got this crazy house in Vegas and you know,
I mean it's the,

240
00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:17.350
it's really the controversy like domestic violence through went to jail for

241
00:13:17.351 --> 00:13:18.280
beating up girls.

242
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:22.780
You know like there's a lot of controversy involved in him and that's one of the

243
00:13:22.781 --> 00:13:24.430
reasons why people wanted to see him fight.

244
00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.690
They want to see him lose and he didn't lose.

245
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:30.340
He went all the way to the bank.
I mean,

246
00:13:30.341 --> 00:13:35.020
he tied rocky Marciano's record for having the most successful fights ever.

247
00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:39.250
49 and l as a champion.
It's not unheard of.
Unheard of.

248
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:44.380
And Rocky Marciano's records bullshit because rocky Marciano Italians right now

249
00:13:44.381 --> 00:13:47.900
going crazy.
What the fuck is Cya and rob caged up badge.

250
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:53.140
It's pretty much agree that rocky Marciano fought his brother and at least one

251
00:13:53.141 --> 00:13:54.640
fight early in his career.

252
00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:59.410
So it was like a fake fight to pull that up.
See if you've,

253
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:04.570
that's been,
that's been validated.
I'm pretty sure I've read that,

254
00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:08.440
that rocky Marciano had like a fixed fight with his brother.

255
00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:10.510
Like back in the day,
you know,

256
00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.090
like a guy like rocky Marciano was a murderous puncher.

257
00:14:13.091 --> 00:14:15.400
It's probably like he would show up for fight and people didn't want to fight

258
00:14:15.401 --> 00:14:18.070
him.
And I'm like the people that paid to see him,
like,
what are we going to do?

259
00:14:18.071 --> 00:14:19.390
I'm like,
damn,
my brother would get in there.

260
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:23.770
So his brother gets in there and goes down to a body shot or something.
I Dunno.

261
00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.180
I Dunno how it played out,
but.
