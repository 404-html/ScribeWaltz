1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.420
Did you don't realize how important the air quality is to when those fires.

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.270
I was doing shows in Sacramento.
I didn't even think of it.

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.960
Pete and fans or a DM or are you going to do,
are you going to cancel?

4
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:10.813
Please don't cancel.
I'm like,

5
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.850
why the fuck would I cancel nine I don't cancel shows.
We'll see soon,
man.

6
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.080
Then I fly in and I was like,
Oh shit.

7
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.560
You couldn't see a foot in front of your face.
She sent me a smoke.

8
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.020
You sent me a picture from your hotel room and I was like,

9
00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:26.370
is there a fire in your room?

10
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.820
I've never seen anything like it and I did not feel good.

11
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.760
Was sick the whole time there to my shows,
US lightheaded,

12
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.370
everyone had mass gone like Asians at airports.

13
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.490
Everybody set for me and my brother and guess what?

14
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.380
We couldn't get any mass cause they're all sold out.
Did they help?
I think so.

15
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.250
They filter some of it,
but I didn't realize how big of a deal it was.

16
00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:50.730
Taiwan up there,
I'm like,
Holy Shit Man,
this is,
this is serious.

17
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.480
Those fires were so big.
The mean the fires down here,

18
00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:58.350
we're big but nothing compared to the northern California fires because of the

19
00:00:58.351 --> 00:01:02.430
area of northern California that got lit up was like woods,

20
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.920
like huge,
huge wooded areas and the whole town was just,
it's not there anymore.

21
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.740
Was a paradise done game over does no,
not knowing.

22
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.620
Nothing's nothing.
The whole town burned down.
Pretty sure go to that.

23
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.480
Pull up paradise.
california.com is that a,

24
00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:24.690
is that a place that wipe down now?

25
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.100
Do you see they fired the fricking,

26
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.010
some of the firefighters in like a relief people cause they were taking pictures

27
00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:35.250
like not even mock and I don't think they should have been fired because there's

28
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.320
like all burnt down house and then there's like,

29
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.450
I dunno like a wooden horse and then like firefighters like on the wooden horse

30
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.500
and like go like your mark mocking the people lost their homes and they,

31
00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:47.640
oh they lost their jobs.
That's crazy.
Come on man.

32
00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:49.350
These guys are fighting for their life out there.

33
00:01:49.351 --> 00:01:53.160
They're probably just had to do with it.
Not only that,
the horse is there,

34
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.880
it's like what do you give a shit?
Why?

35
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.190
Why the house is burned to the ground.

36
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.240
You really think it's that in that poor taste for these poor guys who risk their

37
00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:06.540
lives to save people's houses to have a good time.
Why was that real?

38
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.020
This is crazy.
I should have made it out of those trees.

39
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.190
Trees are still standing in.
The trees are pretty gangster.

40
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.320
Hearing what's going on.
Like at a certain point in time,

41
00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:23.120
we're going to have to make fireproof houses.
Does that exist?

42
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.250
Or making them out of cinder block or you gotta do what?

43
00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:28.860
Kanye didn't just have your own fricking fire department.

44
00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:32.490
Just surround your house just in case.
That's a good move.
In my neighborhood,

45
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.530
there's a house that burned to the ground.

46
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.640
I put pictures of it up on my Instagram as a car in the driveway,

47
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.200
but the um,
whoa,
this is,
this picture is terrifying.
Oh Dude.

48
00:02:43.201 --> 00:02:47.000
You're talking Armageddon style.
This fixture is terrifying.
Is this,

49
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.700
what we're looking at is rows of houses that are gone.

50
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.790
It looks like it goes for an entire neighborhood.
It's an entire neighborhood.

51
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.640
Why?
It's like a mile and just there's nothing left.

52
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.800
Everything's burnt to the ground.
But it's amazing.

53
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:02.650
Those trees are still standing over those trees there.
I mean their torch.

54
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:05.230
But yeah,
they're there.
Yeah.
But it's weird.
Black as fuck.

55
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.220
Isn't it weird when you expect the trees would be burnt to a crisp?
Yeah,

56
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.000
they're so thick.
The other thing is,
uh,
where's I've I,
oh,

57
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:15.010
coming from and I flew down.

58
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:19.870
So from north to south and when you go over Malibu and like in Woodland Hills

59
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:22.720
and where you live,
you wouldn't bell kit.
When you see all that,

60
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
it's insane from a bird's eye view and you just see all the black women flying

61
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:32.860
into La.
Well,
I flew over a Malibu with burr and a helicopter,

62
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.980
so we got real low.
It was,
it's crazy.
Crazy.

63
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.590
We get this Mcdonald's burnt to the ground.
That's crazy.

64
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.210
You know that motherfucker burned when cheese

65
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.650
bridge burnt,
fucked us on before and after steel,
nuts,

66
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.180
wooden.
That was a,
what was it?

67
00:03:50.181 --> 00:03:53.290
A wasn't rich wouldn't look at this like the whole,
everything's gone.

68
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.540
So is that the case that the whole town is evaporated?
Ice Is gone.
Yeah,

69
00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:59.080
pretty sure.

70
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.930
Paradise is what the fuck those people do now do.

71
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.990
You don't rebuild,
right?
You're like,
wow,
Jesus.

72
00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:12.400
And then also a lot of it,
and this just from my own experience down here,

73
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.610
I'm looking at homes in areas where there's chances of fire that were caused by

74
00:04:17.621 --> 00:04:21.340
fires.
Banks won't give you the loan or you have to put a higher,

75
00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:23.230
almost all cash payment down.

76
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.770
And also the house insurance on a fire area.

77
00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:28.000
They're not going to do it these days.

78
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.620
But what are they going to do with a place like Malibu?

79
00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:33.700
Because Malibu got hit harder than anything.
They lost 600 plus houses.

80
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.390
Find out if that's true.
I know they said they lost like 1500 structures,

81
00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:39.670
but someone told me that 600 of those warehouses,

82
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.260
and if you're talking about Malibu,
like when burned,

83
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.380
I were flying around the coastline over by zoom,
uh,
point doom.

84
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.770
You know those people there?
Well James Beach here,

85
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.030
I don't know,
it's the cliffs loosely fire.

86
00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.690
Worst fired to hit Malibu with home loss is topping 1.6 billion.

87
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.860
Bubba,
Bubba,
Bubba,
bubba billion

88
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.100
structures destroyed.

89
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.040
I feel like we don't hear about it so much because I think people assume

90
00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:10.420
everyone Malibu has money.

91
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.020
They are a higher tax bracket so that God will figure it out.

92
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.780
It's still super fucked up,
man.
Well,

93
00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:19.480
I have friends that don't have a lot of money,

94
00:05:19.481 --> 00:05:21.580
but they build houses and one of them,

95
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.750
one of the houses they were living in and the other house they were building and

96
00:05:25.751 --> 00:05:27.820
they're all the,
both houses got torched.

97
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.410
400 single family houses with an estimated market value of 1.6 billion.

98
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.180
So 670 structures,
400 of them were houses.
That's horrible man.

99
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.460
It's a weird to fly over man when you fly over it because in the,

100
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.060
with a helicopter,
you know,
bird was pretty close.
We were,
we were,
you know,

101
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.070
right above it and circling,
you know,
just outside,
right over the ocean.

102
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.960
And as you're doing it and flying over the ocean,

103
00:05:52.961 --> 00:05:57.430
you're looking at these compounds.
There are probably $50 million houses.

104
00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.510
I mean these fucking massive,
massive compounds burnt to the ground

105
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.460
God damn thing they could do about it.
