1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.570
Yeah.
But why can't they spinning back fist boxing?
I don't know.

2
00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.560
Should I be able to Paris,
they are very purist,

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.850
but I see where they're coming from in a certain way.

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.850
Like when boxers talk shit about MMA and striking in MMA,

5
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.780
I see where they're coming from the wrong because your shit won't work.

6
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.900
Like come try that shit.
You're going to get taken down stupid.

7
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.000
Like this is the whole reason why they do it a different way.

8
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.030
But I actually do believe that a boxer with incredible footwork and a jab,

9
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.340
a great job could survive and win in an MMA fight is as long as he doesn't fight

10
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:41.160
a long guy with good kicks,
like a Jon Jones.

11
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.190
Jon Jones just kicked the shit out of you from a distance and you're not even

12
00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:47.670
going to get close to him.
And then by the time you've eaten all those leg kicks,

13
00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:50.700
you're not moving so good.
Yeah.
And the variable hold you and smash your face.

14
00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:54.330
And I agree.
Yeah.
But yeah,
I think,
I think footwork is key.

15
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.320
Do you remember when Vince Foster,
when he was a shit,

16
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.550
not quite world class anymore.

17
00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:03.180
He'd lost the title and this is what worries me because I don't remember shit.

18
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.110
You don't remember shit?
Well,
he fought Masato,

19
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.100
but when Masato was the king of k one over Japan,

20
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.100
Masato the sexiest Japanese man I've ever seen.
A pretty sexy.
Yeah.

21
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.360
He's super lazy.
Sexy isn't sexy.
Yama.
I don't know.

22
00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:22.350
Sexy Yama is what you don't know.
Sexy is sexy.

23
00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:25.610
I haven't fought in the UFC several times.
Fought in pride.
Yeah.

24
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.590
That's a great name though.
A gorgeous,
gorgeous man.

25
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.980
I feel like that should be a super Sushi roll.
There is.

26
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.890
There's sexy Yama Asados way better looking.
Yeah.

27
00:01:34.891 --> 00:01:39.330
You say that you're not succeeding was presence.
Look at that.

28
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.400
I like the way it glows.
Yeah.
Look at them,
man.
It's beautiful.
Like those pecs.

29
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.210
Yeah.
He's got that cross dangling.
Super Low.
What's going on with that?

30
00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:51.150
You look that cro,
it's almost like a belly button ring or some shit.

31
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.270
That's a deal breaker,
right?
A dude with a belly button ring.
How about that?

32
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.270
A Guy,
a gorgeous guy with a belly button ring.
And when he's Freaky,

33
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.340
is that what it means?
He vain or gay as fuck.
More likely.

34
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.800
That's something men just never rubbing.

35
00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:11.290
It means he's freaky or he takes too many selfies.
Yeah,
it definitely does.

36
00:02:11.291 --> 00:02:12.160
She eat.
So,
yeah.

37
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.470
Is that something any man has ever bravely tried to rock my note guys do nipple

38
00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:19.380
rings,
like a real freaky dude.
We'll doing it once you've seen it.

39
00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:23.520
A belly button ring a male.
So one time I saw a pierced.

40
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.330
Who's that?
Oh there it is.
Beautiful.

41
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.770
I thought you were showing me a belly button ring.

42
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.480
There's better pictures of him.

43
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.370
He's very handsome and still is and you know,
and,

44
00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:36.870
and still,
you know,

45
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.520
is very active and all sorts of promotions and stuff.
Japan,

46
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.290
when he fought,
um,
no,

47
00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:47.220
when he was going to fight Petrosian and portraiture and was killing sour,

48
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.560
what happened?
It was supposed to be his like,
uh,
yeah.
Yeah.

49
00:02:53.561 --> 00:02:56.620
And so he's watching Petrosian just,
I think it was sour,

50
00:02:56.621 --> 00:02:59.860
destroy any sour and uh,

51
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:01.630
he's just like,

52
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.810
fuck was like a pull up Masako versus,

53
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.560
um,
Vince Philips because what was interesting about this,
it was a,
it was like,

54
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:14.860
do you remember when I'm Shannon the cannon,
um,

55
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.370
decided to fight in k one and he fought,
uh,

56
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.910
Tom Erickson and a kickboxing match.
No,
you don't remember,

57
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.560
but that was a similar thing,
but Tom Erickson was not,
you know,

58
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.580
Tom Erickson was a wrestler who was an MMA fighter and a Shannon Briggs eight,

59
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:33.520
a couple of leg kicks and he was talking about it on the podcast like that.

60
00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:37.420
He was trying to play it off.
It was like,
God damn,
that shit hurt.
But,
uh,

61
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.310
he wound up Kaylin,
Tom Erickson,

62
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:43.990
but Tom Erickson at the time was not nearly the kind of Stryker that Vince

63
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.730
Phillips was when Vince Phillips Swap Masato.

64
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.960
Vince Phillips had beaten worldclass fighters,
I think.
Who did he beat?

65
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.140
He beat some fucking high level worldclass boxers.

66
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.051
And then,
you know,

67
00:03:56.051 --> 00:04:01.051
we got like 36 37 38 and then took this fight was 37 at the time.

68
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.930
So he fought Vince Phillips.

69
00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:08.650
But it was so weird seeing Vince Phillips walk out there barefoot.

70
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.960
I mean they should have let him wear boxing shoes cause he's not thrown into

71
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.330
kicks.
Yeah.
And Masato just get gimme some fit.

72
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.020
Beautiful Man.
Perfect bone structure.
He's ridiculous.

73
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.160
Perfect hair to English.
And Vince Phillips was like,

74
00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:29.520
what the fuck did I sign up for?
Yeah,

75
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.640
that feeling that they have when they're about to get leg kicked.

76
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.460
So right away opens up inside and just moves away from the punches.

77
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.550
Sets goes up high.
It goes up high punched times,

78
00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:50.260
kicking into the arms and that goes across the leg.
See that's a,

79
00:04:50.261 --> 00:04:53.980
that's a weird one right there across the thigh.
Not shot anywhere.

80
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.883
Throw that one.

81
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.320
But this was,
this is at the time,
like one of the first times that a,

82
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.580
a real worldclass boxer had attempted a kickboxing fight.

83
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.170
And that's um,
I love that he did this.
Friends both.
I did that too.

84
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.281
Do you remember friends?

85
00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:16.570
Both of who was a heavyweight contender and boxing in the eighties and nineties

86
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.893
to watching fights.

87
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.860
If you talked to my wife and ask her what she told me about 10 minutes ago,

88
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.050
I will not remember what the fuck she said.
A lot of shit that I don't remember.

89
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.910
But I have like storage units in my brain and stuff like,
oh that's interesting.

90
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.360
What happened there?
This happened.
Oh,
why did that happen?
Why did this go wrong?

91
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.890
Oh,
okay.
Pull up a Georgia Petrosian versus um,

92
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.230
uh,
Andy Sour as a u e r does it know how's that high spot?

93
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.930
Oh,
here's friends both though.
Yeah,
so friends,
both.
Uh,

94
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.530
this is France.
Both of fat as fuck too.
He had like,
he had hit the wall,

95
00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.890
he was the white buffalo.
He's a South African heavyweight,

96
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.533
but he uh,

97
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.740
he actually learned how to kick a little bit and he was not just boxing guys,

98
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:09.950
but his,
his hands were just way better than most boxers are.

99
00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:12.560
Most kickboxers rather cause he was at one point in time,

100
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.460
a real heavyweight contender.
This is not a good example.

101
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.030
This is 2015 holy shit,
dude,

102
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.460
that this is 2000 this guy was a fucking contender in the 90s he's already hurt.

103
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.430
Oh yeah.
This is had a thrown a knee.
