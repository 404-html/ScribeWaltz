1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
Feel it.
And I think we learn about ourselves through a specialty self.
Well,

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.830
any kind of adversity,
you know,
look,
I'm coming off of,
uh,

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.810
being evacuated from the fires,
which was a for me not that difficult,

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.680
you know,
um,
I'm not poor.
I got a hotel,
I brought my family to the hotel,

5
00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:19.440
we got safe,
got my dog to the,

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.320
to the podcast studio and everybody's all right,
you know,

7
00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:24.480
but for those firefighters,

8
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.820
I mean 12 hour shifts battling the blaze for people who lost their homes.

9
00:00:28.821 --> 00:00:31.110
Some of them tried to save it.
There was a story about a guy in Malibu,

10
00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:34.410
the climbed on top of his roof with a hose and tried to fight off the fire and

11
00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:39.270
he got severe burns and he's in the hospital and I mean,
it's raining ash and,

12
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.380
and,
and,
and these chunks of fucking fire on people,

13
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:44.430
these embers,

14
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.670
they're falling from the sky and this guy's trying to save his house.
I mean,

15
00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:50.310
that guy literally went through the fires.

16
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.390
He'll be a different person after this.
No question.
Um,

17
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.950
we've been in something of a reality drought.

18
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.980
The number of people who have very little relationship to reality.

19
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.770
I mean,
you know,
I used to live in Cambridge,
Massachusetts and you'd,

20
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.730
you'd come in from Boston and there would be the science at freshed killed

21
00:01:08.731 --> 00:01:12.720
chicken,
like no bones bad at man fresh killed chicken,

22
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.960
but like chicken mcnuggets nobody quite knows what,
what,

23
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.840
what part of the chicken is a mcnugget,
right?

24
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.060
It's just some abstraction that comes to you.

25
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.640
And so I think we've gotten very divorced.
They're all,

26
00:01:25.641 --> 00:01:28.560
all of these layers of indirection between us and the world.

27
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.590
And when a fire happens,
it's so overwhelming.
We were just choking on the,

28
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.750
the SF smoke,
uh,
in the bay area.

29
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.420
There's it,
it just,

30
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.840
it gets real after having been unreal for a very long time.

31
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.710
It's unavoidable.
It makes you,
it makes you buck up.

32
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.450
Like you got to get out of there.

33
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.900
Like we got evacuated Thursday at two 30 in the morning.
We,
we were looking up,

34
00:01:51.901 --> 00:01:54.250
we were like,
we gotta get the Fuck Outta here.
Like it,

35
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.340
I don't give a shit what you leave behind.

36
00:01:56.341 --> 00:01:59.520
Just go keep your body and go everything else either.

37
00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:02.160
It's either replaceable or you don't really need it that much anyway,

38
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.480
just fucking get out of there.

39
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.590
And when you see that fire raging over those hills and helicopters dropping

40
00:02:07.591 --> 00:02:11.370
water on it and then another house explodes because the gas line gets hit,

41
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.390
it's just you,
you,
I've saw that,
you see that you go,
oh,
there's,

42
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.490
this is not enough people in the world to save you.

43
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.130
There's not enough fucking firefighters or cops.

44
00:02:20.131 --> 00:02:23.520
There's too many houses as too many people and a bunch of these houses are going

45
00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:27.510
to go,
you've got to get the fuck out of there.
And um,
but there's a certain,

46
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:29.700
I was with,
uh,

47
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.290
a bunch of my friends from my neighborhood and my friend Tom Segura and his
wife,

48
00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:37.470
we all stayed at the same hotel and we felt we've,

49
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.710
there was like a tangible sense of community.
Well,
this is,
I'm,

50
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:42.720
I love this point.

51
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.430
Let's imagine you go for a wedding and they house you with your third cousins.

52
00:02:47.431 --> 00:02:48.570
People you barely know.

53
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.460
If you're lucky enough that the sewage system breaks and like stuff is leaking

54
00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:55.470
out of the ceiling and you guys all have to do heroic,

55
00:02:55.471 --> 00:02:58.950
crazy stuff to save the house,
you're going to be closer to your third cousin.

56
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.150
You are,
you know,
do your uncle.
Right.

57
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.470
And this is this very strange feature of the world that,

58
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.960
eh,
kind of a random arrival of diversity is very often what bonds you to some

59
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:12.400
particular human being.

60
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.380
And if you avoid adversity in groups your whole life,

61
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.830
you probably don't realize that a,

62
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.720
you're never fully activated as a human being or particularly,

63
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.100
you know,
if,

64
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.190
if men I think don't form groups that in some sense fight or battle or contest

65
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:34.000
together.

66
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.140
So there's this very weird fact that apparently humans are the only species that

67
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:42.730
organize,
uh,
contests in teams.
Um,

68
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.160
you know,
this is an intrinsic feature of being human contests.
Yeah.

69
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.150
Do other animals have any contest?
Well,
just stuff they've sparked chimps,

70
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.420
you know,
we'll,
we'll,
uh,

71
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.440
have these incredible raiding parties in a very methodical,
and they'll,

72
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.880
they'll attack somebody else,
but I don't think that they practice it.
It's like,

73
00:04:00.881 --> 00:04:03.550
okay,
your red team,
chimp and your B team chimp,

74
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.990
what were the only ones that do stuff like that that can communicate,
right?

75
00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:11.080
Like dolphins can communicate,
but they don't do stuff like that.
Right?

76
00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:12.880
Or you have individual sparring,

77
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.630
like you'll have two bears learning to play with each other.
Um,

78
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.980
because it's safer to play with your brother and childhood than it is to just

79
00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:25.120
suddenly show up against some big ass bear and have to compete for females.
