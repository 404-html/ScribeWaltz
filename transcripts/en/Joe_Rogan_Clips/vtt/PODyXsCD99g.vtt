1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.930
Novice egis is if you walked into the facility that I just walked into and had

2
00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:08.280
the grand tour that you were given a gentle listener and watcher at home.
Uh,

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.720
I was saying to Joe before we went,
like,
he's got this new plan new to me.

4
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.900
I don't know how long you've been here since October you said?
Yeah,
but it's,

5
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.880
it's a paradise.
It's a,
you know the fuck the term man cave.
This is like man,

6
00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:24.870
empire walk in and it's just,
it's like walking into Joe's head.

7
00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:29.420
It's everything he loves under one fucking roof.
And I said it to him before,
uh,

8
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.460
like you did this with your mouth,

9
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.300
like you talked yourself into this.
Very strange in that.
Awesome.
I mean,

10
00:00:37.301 --> 00:00:40.080
I know you've got,
and you've got a zillion things that you do,

11
00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:43.620
but like even in a world of like the MMA stuff,
that's still your mouth.

12
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.830
It's always your fucking mouth that is taking you from where you started til now

13
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.460
you walk into this building,
it's not like he had a family fortune and his,

14
00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:56.220
it was willed to them.
Your mouth put you in a building.

15
00:00:56.221 --> 00:01:00.540
This nice painted the walls,
the colored as you walk in,
it's like a a museum.

16
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:05.040
It's like you see pieces of,
of him,
hence me all over the fucking place.

17
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.570
That's all out of your mouth.
If anybody's watching or listening at home,

18
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.050
teetering on the verge of like,
I wonder if I should do a podcast,

19
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.530
send them a snapshot of that fucking room where you can launch bow and arrows

20
00:01:16.531 --> 00:01:21.390
for 45 yards.
They'll start talking.
But I think if you're interested at all,

21
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:25.650
you should do a podcast.
It can be,
it can be a way to make a living.

22
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.630
There's enough people like this.
I'm not a one of those,
um,
famine thinkers.

23
00:01:30.631 --> 00:01:33.730
I think the opposite.
I was like,
you could do it.
Anybody could do it.

24
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.180
I'm never like,
man,
it might not be enough for everybody.
I agree.

25
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.110
I'm always the guy who encouraged to like,
hey,
try it because oh my God,

26
00:01:40.111 --> 00:01:42.840
it's fucking fun for me and I,
you know,
we've been,

27
00:01:42.841 --> 00:01:47.070
we're rare birds and as much as we've been around since the fucking art form

28
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:51.910
started,
like you've been doing podcasts since a minute after podcast.

29
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.520
Cool.
At first he was the Guy Predate Corolla.
Yeah.
Well yeah for sure.

30
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.350
But a short,
so,
but you're in the first five years you were,
well,

31
00:02:01.351 --> 00:02:04.050
what year did you start?
I started,

32
00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:07.340
we just celebrated last year was our 10th anniversary smart guests.

33
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.360
We're now a year 11 so count back from now is two 2007 yeah,

34
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.180
a couple of years.
When did you begin?

35
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.240
Think 2009 to two years and none of the big bang when I,

36
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.780
when I jumped in,

37
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.120
it was Leo Laporte doing this week in tech and I think he still does that.

38
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.090
And the happy tree friends and that was like the apple podcast,

39
00:02:32.091 --> 00:02:33.120
top five.

40
00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:37.620
And then me and Scott started with smog cast and then later on we added a bunch

41
00:02:37.621 --> 00:02:40.500
of stuff.
But getting in within the first two years,

42
00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:44.220
like we happened and then right on the heels of us,

43
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.950
Adam was on the radio and then the radio job went away and I had a year,

44
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.850
was that where Adam went to podcasting?

45
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.690
I gotta be 2000 if we started smog guest 2007.
I got,
it's either in,

46
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.450
we start February,

47
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.750
2007 either he loses the radio Gig in 2007 and moves the podcast or it happens

48
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:06.650
in 2008 but it was,
isn't that neighborhood.
Yes.
And he's,
he was the,
uh,

49
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.910
the,
the model for a lot of folks now,
like Ralph Garman,

50
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:13.000
the guy that I do Hollywood babble.
I love Ralph.
Ralph's amazing.

51
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.540
He was let go by K rock earlier this year or later.
Yeah.

52
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:18.580
Light at the end of last year.
Right before Christmas.

53
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.550
And so he too moved into a kind of online world.
Um,
it,
it,

54
00:03:23.551 --> 00:03:27.170
it can sustain a motherfucker.
Yeah.

55
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.850
Ralph's a very strong report as his show.
I like him a lot.
He's a good dude.

56
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:34.030
Good Dude.
But I'm talking to him when you,

57
00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:36.340
when you go to k rock and that's how our friendship began.

58
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.010
You sit there doing the show and then afterwards,

59
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:42.010
like I was a cigarette smoker in those days and we'd sit there out in the

60
00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:45.190
parking lot and smoke and slowly,

61
00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:49.150
like I remember I came in once k rock just to announce like,
Hey,

62
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.130
I've rented a theater on Santa Monica Boulevard and we're calling it smog casts

63
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.290
when we're going to where the world's first live podcasting theater and we're

64
00:03:58.291 --> 00:04:00.040
going to do podcasts there and stuff.

65
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.500
And so Ralph was listening and he's right there.
And then,
uh,

66
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.520
like months prior he had approached me,
he's like,
hey man,

67
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:11.410
would you ever want to do like the show Biz beat?

68
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:15.520
That's what he used to do on k rock on Kevin and been like as a Saturday show.

69
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:18.760
And I was like,
Fuck Ya.
Hear myself on the radio.
That'd be fantastic.

70
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.730
So we recorded a demo for the show,

71
00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:23.530
gave it to his bosses and his bosses were like,

72
00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:27.970
nobody wants to listen to people talk on the radio anymore.
And so it died.

73
00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:28.840
They're just like,

74
00:04:28.841 --> 00:04:33.841
how years ago things died when you couldn't get past a gatekeeper who was like,

75
00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:38.340
we don't want your shit.
Was this after the talk radio station in La went under?

76
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.790
Yes.
Okay.
So they probably were like,
yes on that.

77
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.870
And they were just,
you know,
k rock was reading the tea leaves,
which was like,

78
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.640
people don't want to hear people chat.
This one,
I'm playing music,

79
00:04:49.641 --> 00:04:52.780
we're competing with satellite radio now we're competing with streaming music

80
00:04:52.781 --> 00:04:56.050
where it's like they don't have to wait 15 minutes to hear a song.

81
00:04:56.051 --> 00:05:00.130
Dance could shows though,
which can waste Steckler.
That was a really good show.

82
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.390
Yeah,
they were great.
There's a bunch of really good shows.
But the,
uh,

83
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.470
so he,

84
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.850
we had tried that and it was called Showbiz beat.

85
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.430
And then months later when I was in there going like,
yeah,

86
00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:16.060
I'm opening this podcast theater afterwards in the parking lot,

87
00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:19.000
grabbing the post show smoke.
Ralph is just like,
hey,

88
00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:23.000
would you ever want to try that radio show at that theater?
And I was like,

89
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.410
fuck yeah,
you want to do it as a podcast?
And he was like,
yeah,
like yeah,

90
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:31.390
let's try it out.
And so I was driving home and I texted him at a light.

91
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.810
I said,
we could call it Hollywood Babylon.

92
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.730
It was an old book called Hollywood Babylon that was about like gossipy stories

93
00:05:39.731 --> 00:05:40.930
about Hollywood people and stuff.

94
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.230
But we spell that of course different lane stuff.
And that was my,

95
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.080
that's what I brought to Babylon.
Uh,
other than that,

96
00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:51.760
Ralph built that entire thing and then my job became to sit next to them and

97
00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:55.030
react to the news,
which is,
that's why I love that podcast so much.

98
00:05:55.031 --> 00:05:58.760
Cause as you can tell,
I fucking love sound of my voice and I wind up talking,

99
00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:02.810
talking,
talking on smog casts.
I would lead on Jane saw and Bob get old,

100
00:06:02.811 --> 00:06:06.440
which is really about Jason Muse.
I wound up wind up talking a bunch,

101
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.660
but with Babylon,

102
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:12.940
I get to sit there while he's the main act and I'm,
you know,

103
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.650
the second banana,
I mean it's,

104
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.370
it's nice to be able to top and bottom in the world of podcasting.

105
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.530
Like you know,
it,
it's,
it gives you a place to go.

106
00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:26.300
If I'm topping all the time,
right.

107
00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:28.940
Then I'm talking about my thoughts and what I believe in and these are the

108
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.220
experiences I've had and people are interested in that.

109
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.940
But then sometimes you just want to check out and talk about somebody else's

110
00:06:34.941 --> 00:06:38.210
shit.
None.
A podcast we do called fat man on a mountain and that's what we do.

111
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:40.120
I just sit around and go like,
oh my God,

112
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.660
you watch the Avengers and shit like that.

113
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.320
So you get to concentrate on that kind of stuff.
So yeah,

114
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.080
the Babylon thing grew insanely organically.
We started that little theater,

115
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.670
sat 48 people,

116
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.090
and since he was on the radio every morning he could just fucking sell it out.

117
00:06:53.091 --> 00:06:56.140
He'd be like,
Hey,
go to Kevin Smith's website.
You get tickets for battle on,

118
00:06:56.141 --> 00:06:59.600
it'd be sold there.
He's that you place on,
was it,

119
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:04.420
it was somewhere in West Hollywood,
right?
That little theater.
It was on a Oros.

120
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.090
Yeah,
it was on Santa Monica Boulevard in an area,
uh,

121
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.150
where they put up a few black box theaters.
This,

122
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.490
this section is called the complex.

123
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:18.820
And we had one theater in the complex and repainted it and hung up like all the

124
00:07:18.831 --> 00:07:21.650
artwork.
Like you got our work based on the podcast out in the hallway.

125
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.940
Same thing.
We were like essentially built a shrine to Scott Mosier,

126
00:07:25.941 --> 00:07:30.020
my cohost of smog casts,
which I'm sure on some level creeped him the fuck out.

127
00:07:30.021 --> 00:07:33.980
First time he walked in was just like,
he wants to wear my skin,
you know?

128
00:07:33.981 --> 00:07:37.250
And so the idea was we're going to do nothing but smog cast here.

129
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:42.350
But since Scott didn't suddenly go into like,
yeah,
let's do five podcasts a week,

130
00:07:42.351 --> 00:07:43.970
you know,
it stayed pretty much the same.

131
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.000
We had a theater with nothing going on in it and stuff.

132
00:07:47.001 --> 00:07:51.340
So I started trying other things.
Babylon became one of them.
Jane Song,

133
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:55.370
Bob Get old also came out of that experience as well.
Have that theater.
No,

134
00:07:55.371 --> 00:08:00.290
we let go of that.
Me and Maddie Cohen,
who's a cohost on this very fun podcast,

135
00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:01.550
he doesn't have the Macaulay Culkin.

136
00:08:01.551 --> 00:08:03.620
Have you spoken to fucking Macaulay Culkin yet?
No.

137
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:09.050
I'm just putting a be a bug in your ear.
Oh fuck dude.
Fuck.

138
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:12.890
He gives good talk,
good oral.
I mean that sounds filthier than I meant to,

139
00:08:12.891 --> 00:08:13.641
but you know what I'm saying,

140
00:08:13.641 --> 00:08:18.410
like as a guest fucking fascinating and funny and get it.

141
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:22.610
Anyway,
Matt and and Macaulay do a podcast called bunny ears.

142
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.480
And so Matt Cohen was the guy that I'd opened smart castle with.

143
00:08:26.481 --> 00:08:27.380
Like I was got going,

144
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.770
I wish I had a black box theater and Matt went out and found it and stuff.

145
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.380
So we kept it open for like one year and then let it go.

146
00:08:33.381 --> 00:08:38.060
Because what had happened was like the Babel show sold so well,
so quickly,

147
00:08:38.061 --> 00:08:41.870
all the time that it became clear,
like we could move this to a bigger theater.

148
00:08:41.871 --> 00:08:45.470
This is a thing.
He was on the radio all the time,
so it was easy to move seats.

149
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:50.800
So we went up to the Lovetts,
remember the John Lovitz comedy club?
Um,

150
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.480
Ralph had went to the Improv and love,
it's in love.
It's where like,

151
00:08:53.481 --> 00:08:58.140
you could have 95 or 100% of the doors,
something ridiculous.
And,

152
00:08:58.141 --> 00:09:00.840
uh,
and that was the only reason we went up there,
were there for a while.

153
00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:04.020
Things fell out with Lovitz and stuff,
and then we moved to the Improv instead.

154
00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:05.720
So we've been there ever since.
Um,

155
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.420
and now we do it on the road quite a bit and stuff.
