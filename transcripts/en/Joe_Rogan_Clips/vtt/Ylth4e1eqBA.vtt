00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640
The fuck did he get reelected as a nice,

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.540
Connecticut's a bulletin stuff cause it's tribalism.

3
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.730
You're going to vote blue in Connecticut,
but how would,

4
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.820
how would they accept him as their candidate?
Because he got,

5
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.340
I think it came out once he was the candidate.
Oh Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

6
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.650
That's a big one man.
Yet is stolen valor and all that stuff.
I mean,

7
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:19.080
forget about what Brian Williams did.
That's way bigger.

8
00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:22.500
I get shit for having shaved sides of my hair.
People were like,

9
00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:25.740
is that's the Nazi?
No,
they're like,
is that stolen valor?
And I'm like,
no,

10
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.620
I've gotten that.
Yes.
Come on a haircut.

11
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.650
This is on politifact.com about it.

12
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.750
<v 1>Um,
he listened to Marine Corps reserves in 1970 until then,</v>

13
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.930
five deferments had kept him out of the war,

14
00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:40.730
getting a coveted slot in the reserves,

15
00:00:40.731 --> 00:00:43.490
reduced the chance of battlefield deployment Blumenthal.

16
00:00:43.491 --> 00:00:47.120
Went through basic training and served six years in the Washington DC area in

17
00:00:47.121 --> 00:00:50.000
Connecticut as Connecticut's Attorney General Blumenthal,

18
00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:53.660
regularly attended Memorial Day parades and other events that recognize soldiers

19
00:00:53.661 --> 00:00:57.140
and veterans in New York.
Times wrote and May 17th,

20
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.670
2010 that in 2003 Blumenthal had spoken at a rally supporting troops overseas.

21
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.470
Though newspaper reported that Blumenthal said when we returned,

22
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.180
we saw nothing like this.

23
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.500
That was a comparison with soldiers who came back from Vietnam Blumenthal

24
00:01:12.501 --> 00:01:17.390
repeatedly repeated a similar line in 2007 Memorial Day parade in Milford,

25
00:01:17.391 --> 00:01:22.130
Connecticut and at a 2008 ceremony for veterans and senior citizens.

26
00:01:22.131 --> 00:01:23.000
Blumenthal said,

27
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:27.320
we have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam.

28
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.830
<v 0>Ooh,
Yup.
And then look at the very bottom line.</v>

29
00:01:30.831 --> 00:01:32.510
Although I did not serve in Vietnam,

30
00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:36.740
I've seen firsthand the effects of military action.
Aha.
Well that's cool story,

31
00:01:36.741 --> 00:01:38.780
Bro.
He's alive.
Why do you think firsthand?

32
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.020
<v 1>Yeah.
Well that's,
he said,</v>

33
00:01:42.021 --> 00:01:46.670
we have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam.

34
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.050
If they quoted that and that's a f f he said that a 2008 ceremony,

35
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.940
that's a liar.
Yeah.
I mean that's just,
that's stolen valor,
but you know,
it's,

36
00:01:55.941 --> 00:01:56.774
it's,

37
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.310
it's a lie as much as it's stolen valor cause he does have military service,

38
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.070
which,
you know what I mean?
He was a part of the reserves,

39
00:02:04.071 --> 00:02:07.430
which is an important part of the military.
There's no,
I mean,

40
00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:09.260
you don't want to diminish that,

41
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.710
but lying about having actually been in Vietnam is it's as close to stolen valor

42
00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:18.620
as you can get with actually being a veteran.

43
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.900
<v 0>Yeah,
yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
It's like shady,
shady,</v>

44
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.250
but they're dirty people.
They're dirty people.
Yeah,
of course.

45
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.710
It's a dirty business.
Horrible,
horrible people.

46
00:02:29.711 --> 00:02:34.180
So that's why when people are like,
venerating these monsters,
I'm like,

47
00:02:34.181 --> 00:02:38.320
what the fuck is wrong with you?
These people are horrible.
Just doing that,

48
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.430
just doing that alone.

49
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.170
That's what's hilarious that he got through though.
Oh yeah.
It's,

50
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.890
it's funny when people can get away with,
does he ever said,
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.400
Shouldn't have said that.
What'd he say?
Oops.

52
00:02:51.401 --> 00:02:56.080
I did it again in a spoke and made mistakes and I have,

53
00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.393
I have misspoken

54
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.910
<v 1>about my service and I regret and I take full responsibility.</v>

55
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.330
<v 0>You don't feel responsibility means resigning?
Does it?
If you're taking,</v>

56
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.870
what does responsibility mean?
If there's no consequences?
Well,

57
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.830
that's a good question.
Well,
the consequences are public shaming.

58
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.790
Maybe he is the best person for the job despite the fact that he lied a decade

59
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.580
ago.
I still don't know what responsibility means in this context.

60
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.170
I've taken responsibility.
I remember gender.
I was,
I had found a mine,

61
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.851
Janet Reno,

62
00:03:23.851 --> 00:03:27.700
when Waco happened in all those kids died and all the sheep say Janet Reno was a

63
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:30.160
friend of yours.
No,
a friend of mine was talking about January.
No,
no,
no.

64
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.870
I knew Janet Reno was pals with Janet Reno was a friend of mine.
You're no,

65
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.000
denora.
Janet Reno.
Um,

66
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.600
and she went on TV after Waco and all those people died and she goes,

67
00:03:40.601 --> 00:03:43.060
this is my fault.
I take full responsibility.
And my friend's like,

68
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.260
then you should be in jail.

69
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.400
If you are responsible for murdering dozens of people getting killed,

70
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:49.690
you should be in jail.
