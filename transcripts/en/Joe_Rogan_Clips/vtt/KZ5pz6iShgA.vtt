00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:05.320
The joe rogan experience.
As long as you keep chucking that,
hey over the side,

2
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.670
keep it coming,
keep dead.
Hey,
come on baby.
Yeah,
good to go.

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.770
When we have connections with certain animals,
elephants are a big one,

4
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.020
you know?
Um,
lions are a big one.
Giraffes for whatever reason are a big one.

5
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.740
Even zebras,
people like,
why are you shooting at Zebra?
Too much like a horse?

6
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.120
Yeah,
like we have these,

7
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.920
but if it's like an antelope that you eat,

8
00:00:29.921 --> 00:00:31.210
like all that kind of makes sense.

9
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.270
Like we have these kind of makes sense animals and again,
wart hogs.

10
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.220
Nobody gives a fuck about warthogs.

11
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.410
There's no one out there trying to save the Warhawk.

12
00:00:38.411 --> 00:00:39.760
People don't even know how many there are.

13
00:00:39.761 --> 00:00:44.710
They don't care and care less like people worried about lions and no one is out

14
00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:49.120
there wondering how many ward hogs are,
are left in Africa.
I see it all the time.

15
00:00:49.121 --> 00:00:51.340
It's like people will comment,
not hunters,
obviously,

16
00:00:51.341 --> 00:00:53.760
but they'll be like on my page and say,
well,
oh,

17
00:00:53.761 --> 00:00:55.540
I don't have a problem if you killed deer and elk,

18
00:00:55.541 --> 00:00:58.630
but there's no reason to kill a bear.
Right.
What are you talking about?

19
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.960
Have you ever had bear sausage?
Yeah.
Well,
if you've had beer saw and you,

20
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.490
you probably haven't,
but if you,
if you have,
it's Goddamn good.

21
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.700
And why is it any different?
It's the same.
Why is it any different?
Yeah,

22
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.080
it's not.
Yeah,
so it's just what they're,

23
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.060
it's just what they're ingrained to feel about an animal,
I think.
Well they,

24
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.140
they seem to dog like thanks.
Yeah.
That's a thing.

25
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.920
That's the thing with people that bears just seem dog like,
oh,

26
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.210
they're portrayed as being nice if people have them for pets too.

27
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.380
Like there's a lot of people that have bears pets like a hot Russian people am

28
00:01:35.381 --> 00:01:37.930
in on Instagram.
Do you have lunch?
Fine.
Them,

29
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.530
this is one motherfucker as a giant grizzly bear that he cuddles with.

30
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.800
People keep sending me videos of this guy.
I'm like,
one day,

31
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.540
I know I say this video is going to get dark.
God.
Yeah.

32
00:01:49.541 --> 00:01:52.990
Look at this guy.
It's got a sweet bear.
It's just chilling with this bird,

33
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.150
this bird month moon.
And we hung out

34
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.530
my girlfriend and her rubbers back,
but one day my baby.

35
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.630
Yeah.
Yeah.

36
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.300
It looks like it looks like a cool bear.
It's dope bear.
Look,

37
00:02:10.301 --> 00:02:14.320
they're fucking awesome animals,
man.
I love all of them.
Yeah.

38
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.980
But here's the deal.
If you had a thousand of those living in your neighborhood,

39
00:02:17.981 --> 00:02:20.290
you'd have to thin the herd.
Yeah.
You just have to,

40
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.310
and the reality of all this stuff is super complex and I just do not think you

41
00:02:25.781 --> 00:02:30.700
get an understanding of it from,
you know,
in front of your laptop in Vancouver.

42
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.350
You just,
you don't know for sure.

43
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.950
<v 1>Okay.</v>
