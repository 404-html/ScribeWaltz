1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.460
Yeah,
my son,
my son's stubs,
his toe,
my heart drops,
man.
Yeah.
It's hard.
Man.

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.880
Falls on the ground.
Like what crazy did you ever feel so vulnerable and you're,

3
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.010
oh my God,
I'm terrified of the world now.
Terrified I'll be driving my car,

4
00:00:13.011 --> 00:00:14.100
my get a slow down there.

5
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.710
Do you think of people different now that you have a kid?

6
00:00:16.711 --> 00:00:18.240
Do you remember sent I'm way more.

7
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.490
I'm way more like I'm more scared of the world.
I feel like a more loving now.

8
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.370
I also,
if I have friends who are Shitty Dad,

9
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.690
I barely hang out with them anymore or hold resent against cause like that too.

10
00:00:30.691 --> 00:00:34.920
That little dude and eat you so bad.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now I feel the same way.

11
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.550
Yeah.
Um,
you know,
the thing is like,
I,

12
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.470
I feel sad for people who don't make the transition.
You know,

13
00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:47.400
there's,
there's a transition to being a father that some people resist.
Yup.

14
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.290
Where it becomes the primary focus of your life becomes a big,
big,
big deal.

15
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.670
But if you make that transition,

16
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.700
the love that comes out of that and the change that it brings about in you and

17
00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:03.840
the benefits for your child there so substantial.
Ah,
the,
I mean,

18
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.050
and it's so cliche.
It's the,
Oh,
it's the best thing I've ever done.
Straight up,

19
00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:10.320
man.
I've had a cool fucking life.
It is by far the best thing I've ever done.

20
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.790
I want a squad.
I want the love I get from that little dude.
I'm like,

21
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.100
three of you would be even cooler.
Yeah.
You're going to have more,
100% yeah.

22
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.880
Working on it right now.
Yup.
Shooting live ones try,
man.
Fuck.
Yeah.

23
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.960
Yeah.
No.
This thing's working or whatever.
Fucking tail tail.

24
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.420
Yeah.
They say take zinc,
take zinc and magnesium.

25
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.510
I'm taking all these weird pills.
It's now get that to get the load that come.

26
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.420
Come you gotta save your loads too.
I know Jack.
A big day.
Yeah.

27
00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:44.190
I went to a fertility clinic and they were all,

28
00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:48.600
when's the last time you jacked off?
Like my girl?
Yeah.
I'm like,
Bro,
you're like,

29
00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:51.920
I don't damn dude.
I never forget.
Never if I need to do it,

30
00:01:51.921 --> 00:01:54.050
I don't need to look at me Bro.
Dude,
I had to go get,

31
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.360
I have to go give them a sample.
Yeah.
And just see how,
you know how my,

32
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.720
how my guys are swimming.
Well,
first of all,
it's not,

33
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.960
it wasn't very professional at all.
They're like,
go just go down there.

34
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.690
It was you grow with you when you got to give him a sample.
Yeah.
Man.

35
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.860
Tell to help you.
I,
she was like busy talking to the guy in there.

36
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.590
She was like talking to the doctor and he's like,
he'll just take you the back.

37
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.630
I'm like,
alright.
Yeah.

38
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.240
So you had to jerk off knowing your girls in the other room too.

39
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.900
So I walk into this room,
it's just Mexican dude.
Just like,
hey man,

40
00:02:21.901 --> 00:02:25.260
just go in there.
Don't touch anything.
Just fill up the blank.

41
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.320
Got Egos and Oh yeah,
the porn,

42
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.090
They'll take your old style TV,
Vc v,

43
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.120
And I'm like,

I don't need any of this.
I have a fucking cell phone

44
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.240

You fucking old dinosaur.
Fuck Outta here.

45
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.091
He goes,

46
00:02:45.091 --> 00:02:49.260
we have magazines down there and with our 40 from the 70s what kind of bacteria

47
00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:52.050
is Marty on those flights?
I know you get the fuck out of here.

48
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.340
Other dudes loads and lube.
I'll take it from there.
Yeah.

49
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.230
How sterile and I would have been super shady.

50
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.850
Have told my wife you're coming with me.

51
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.350
Do I felt like it was embarrassing to like,
like,

52
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.300
like I can them the thing in a bag and he just looks at it loads.

53
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.680
I'll do what if you open it up and smell it now?
You good man.

54
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.820
He lot of asparagus Bro.

55
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.020
And then when you're walking back to everyone knows that you're coming back.

56
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:20.890
You just get done Jack.
And we should walk up with your arms up in the air.

57
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:23.440
Like you scored the winning touchdown.
Yes.

58
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.990
Joy that fuck yes.
But what happened?
This is my thing.
This is my,

59
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:32.470
and I went kind of down to Eddie Bravo conspiracy.
I'm like,
what if for like,

60
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:34.170
damn,
your sperm is not good dude.
We get,

61
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.470
we're going to need more to take that to like he's a baby.
Baby's big dude.

62
00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:42.190
We're going to use his genetics.
Make me sell that shit.
Black market.

63
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.630
There's a bunch of little browns running around.

64
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.710
You know what has happened many times more than once is these doctors,

65
00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:49.270
if fertility clinics swap out,

66
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:51.880
other peoples come for their own and they have a bunch of their,

67
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.500
their own babies running around.

68
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.430
Like these people have wanted specific genetics and this one redheaded doctor

69
00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.820
just shoot loads of the cups and then everybody's like,
hey,

70
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.990
why isn't my fucking kid have red hair?
The fuck?

71
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.800
Where's your nerdy man?
One doctor got arrested.

72
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:12.930
I think he fathered like a hundred children.
Oh my God.

73
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.980
Damn crazy.
Crazy person or awesome.
Give it back to the world.

74
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.680
I think he's just a crazy person because as a seed,
yeah,

75
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.860
he was running a sperm bank or a fertility clinic,

76
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:27.430
one of those and he just decided,
nope,
it's going to be all me.

77
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.920
All my loads out there too.

78
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.560
Don't you think for like a retirement plan for these assets.
The dude,

79
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.710
what does that image?
Oh,
okay.

80
00:04:36.711 --> 00:04:41.170
It looks like a bunch of these two accounts.
There's a bunch of these guys.

81
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.370
It's not just one [inaudible] 90 to 92 no,
no.

82
00:04:45.371 --> 00:04:49.720
I'm talking about like real resale to years in prison.
Oh yeah.
Shit.

83
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.340
He got to prison for that 280 years,
son.
280 years for jerking off.

84
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.800
Who could be seen to be saying,
oh dude,

85
00:04:56.801 --> 00:04:58.900
don't you think you've very tired fighter,
let's say,

86
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.880
or athlete just in general like Hershel Walker's so and pay him $1 million for

87
00:05:02.881 --> 00:05:04.600
him to blow a load into a cup.

88
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.020
Did you ever watch the HBO Expo say on Beek Crumb from the beak from yoga?

89
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.160
Oh yeah,
he's fucking,
he was here he is Indiana fertility doctor uses own sperm.

90
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.800
This is 2016 around 50 times papers say,
wow,

91
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.940
this is a recent guy.

92
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.940
I think there's been a bunch of these guys throughout history.

93
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.840
I think they should test every one of those guys.

94
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.610
They should make sure that they're not doing that.

95
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.880
Anybody running a fertility clinic?
It tickets.

96
00:05:32.881 --> 00:05:35.260
It's like you get bored over and over again.

97
00:05:35.261 --> 00:05:37.250
Guys are jacking off in the cops and you're like,
you know what?

98
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.830
Make my day exciting.
If I take out this load and put it in my room,

99
00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.780
600 children.
There you go.
Wow.

100
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.560
Fathered 600 children and own fertility clinic.
Wow.

101
00:05:47.561 --> 00:05:51.440
Repeatedly using his own sperm fertility clinic.
He ran.
Hey,

102
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.690
that's some sketchy shit,
man.
I'm telling you,
this is a normal thing.

103
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.600
Guys are gross.
Guys are grown.
Men are gross.
Have a woman run that thing.

104
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.410
Women who were anti men less.
I swear to God,
we're not all like this,

105
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:06.950
but I get it.
I get it.
I really do get,
I talked about it in my special,

106
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:09.600
some creeps.
Yeah.
I mean I talked about it in this last special,

107
00:06:09.601 --> 00:06:13.400
it's like I get it.
Yeah.
If I was a woman,
I'd be a feminist.
I get it.

108
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.940
We're fucking gross,
but not all of us.
Not all.
I would,

109
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.170
I would never jerk off in the 600 cups and pretend it was someone else's load.

110
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.000
Never even crossed my mind.
It's not me,

111
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.120
but I know that there's guys like that out there.

112
00:06:26.121 --> 00:06:28.670
That does not surprise me in the slightest.

113
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.630
The fees.

114
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:36.630
I'm fucking fat gross guy with a little tiny dick and some woman with this

115
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.920
banging ass and little tiny waist.

116
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.820
Big Old titties comes in and she's like,
you know,

117
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.170
we were just trying to get pregnant.
We're really struggling.

118
00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:48.380
So we decided to go the sperm donor route like,
hey,

119
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:53.420
we got a super athlete and he's a genius.
Another guy,

120
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.820
Use zones to father 11 kids.
