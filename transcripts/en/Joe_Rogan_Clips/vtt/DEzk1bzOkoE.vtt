1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.510
Or about the virtual reality setup that we have back there.
That disturbs me.

2
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.160
That disturbs me.
It did.
Doesn't disturb me that you know,
it's bad for you.

3
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:09.611
Anything like that.

4
00:00:09.611 --> 00:00:14.611
It's so fun and it's so immersive and I know and I know where it's going.

5
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.290
I'm like it's going to keep getting better and better.

6
00:00:17.291 --> 00:00:21.670
Just like it was 30 seconds to download a just a simple piece of paper filled

7
00:00:21.671 --> 00:00:24.010
with text,
you know,
20 years ago,

8
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.390
20 years from now that is going to look like crayons.
Oh totally.
I mean,

9
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.270
but that is the,
the,
you got to put that thing on your own.
A freak out.

10
00:00:31.271 --> 00:00:34.600
There's some archery games too.
Yeah,
it's a bunch of them.
It's pretty cool.

11
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.720
You actually have a,
it's called a haptic feedback.

12
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.430
So as you draw the bow back,
you actually feel like a vibration handling.

13
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.430
Yup.
Yup.
And then you let go like that clunk,
Tesla suit Jesus Christ tests.

14
00:00:48.431 --> 00:00:52.220
While it's not the same company,
they're just calling it that far.

15
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.580
As far as I know.
Fuck you.
Other company,

16
00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.190
Tesla suit on failed and ces 2019 takes virtual reality to new heights.

17
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.460
Yeah.
They're going to have haptic feedback suits.
Is that what it is?
Yeah.

18
00:01:03.461 --> 00:01:05.340
There's like 68 sensors in there and you can,

19
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.380
it's supposed to feel like up to a grain,
I guess,
and put one rarely

20
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.800
cracks.

21
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.750
Those are going gonna put it right on their posts and they're just going to kind

22
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.780
shoot themselves.
Ooh.
Ooh,
Ooh.

23
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.500
You could've come home.
You'll,

24
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.560
your girls going to have a haptic feedback suit on and one of them artificial

25
00:01:23.561 --> 00:01:28.090
machine guns.
It's going wreck reality.
Yeah.
Video of a girl doing it.

26
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.530
Uh,
does she gets shocked?

27
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.430
<v 1>No,
but,
well,
it's,
there's a couple of different things.
This is just a test,</v>

28
00:01:34.431 --> 00:01:37.490
but she takes like a hard front kick to the chest here.
Yeah.
I mean,

29
00:01:37.491 --> 00:01:40.670
I don't know how,
how it felt to her,
but okay.
Let's see.

30
00:01:40.671 --> 00:01:45.390
Hard front kick to the chess hot explosion back here.
Actually,
I did it.

31
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.640
Okay.
Second round.

32
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.240
<v 2>I'm kicking you guys nothing.
Oh,</v>

33
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.070
<v 1>okay.
Appreciate it.
Oh,
it's not that hard,</v>

34
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.610
but I did feel it right here.
Hot Explosion.
Oh,

35
00:01:57.611 --> 00:01:59.260
do I really want to try it?
Yes,
I do.

36
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.710
<v 0>Well,
there's a boxing game that you can play.
It's really cool.
And uh,</v>

37
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.860
the boxing game,
you,
you see this guy in front of you,

38
00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:17.670
like a big three d cartoon really?
But really cool graphics.

39
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.650
And when he punches you,
the whole screen goes bright.
Look,

40
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.230
you got your Bell Rung.
Damn.
It makes you nervous.
Like when I'm,

41
00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:27.690
when I'm sparring with him any,
he punches me.
I'm like,

42
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.050
oh Jesus got to get my hands up.
I got to shit.

43
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.620
It feels real and you get exhausted because you're moving around.

44
00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:35.460
You're punching just,

45
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.380
it's harder believe it or not to punch air than it is to punch something.
Oh,

46
00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:43.760
definitely.
Yeah.
Yeah,
because you get tired,
you get tired easier.
Yeah.

47
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.250
So you're throwing your hands of this thing and you know,
you're,

48
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.900
and then she goes down,
you're like,
ah.

49
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.240
And it gets back up and your feet hurt from moving around,

50
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.410
squeaking around on the floor on really interesting.
Yeah.
Yeah.

51
00:02:55.411 --> 00:03:00.411
So there's for sure going to be a weird world for our kids when they get to be,

52
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:06.460
you know,
our age,
the world is going to be unrecognizable.
Yeah.

53
00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:09.940
I feel like it's taken the edge off things too.
It has that,

54
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.270
it really takes the edge off things like you haven't actually done that.

55
00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:15.460
Like you haven't actually climbed Everest,
but I sort of have,

56
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:19.020
I did it in a virtual reality game and it was entirely though not really low.

57
00:03:19.021 --> 00:03:22.200
You know,
you didn't have,
your life wasn't that stake.
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah.

58
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.870
I've been actually talking about this on stage that I'm worried about this.

59
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:30.871
I'm worried about people being able to have experiences that they didn't earn.

60
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.300
You know,
like if,
if someone,
if there's a virtual reality game where you,

61
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.420
you play it and all of a sudden you're in a,
a NASCAR and you're,
you know,

62
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:42.280
you're winning some gigantic race.

63
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.540
You're in the driver's seat and your mood shifting the gears and you mean feels

64
00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:50.410
like you're like indiscernible from feeling like you're winning a race.

65
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.590
That's going to happen.
You're going to,

66
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.820
they're going to be able to do all these different things and it's gonna.

67
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.500
It's gonna make people more and more dependent on technology and weaker and

68
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:03.910
weaker and weaker.
That's how I feel too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's like,
um,

69
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.210
it's like gone to the gym and working out and getting all of these muscles,

70
00:04:07.211 --> 00:04:11.620
but then moving away from any manual labor.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

71
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.290
And not,
I'm not saying don't be fit,

72
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.060
but I'm saying if you'll build their muscles,
fucking use them.
That is true.

73
00:04:19.061 --> 00:04:23.080
There's a lot of guys that go to the gym and they'll work out hard for 45

74
00:04:23.081 --> 00:04:27.550
minutes an hour to Jim,
but make them work a construction site,
character,
lumber,

75
00:04:27.551 --> 00:04:28.390
all day.

76
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.570
There'll be fucking complaining and looking for the protein shakes and now

77
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.710
the real problem is going to be sex.
Yeah.
That's the real problem.

78
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.290
You gotta be able to put those things on and have sex with anybody you want.

79
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.560
Like anybody scarlet Johannson it's fucking weed started.

80
00:04:44.561 --> 00:04:47.740
They already doing these things where they face swap with computers.

81
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.030
So they'd take beautiful actresses and they put their face on porn stars bodies.

82
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.190
And it's hard to tell men,

83
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.150
I mean it looks like a sex tape with a famous actress.

84
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.000
That's these debating.
It is disturbing because a Jaguar I go one,

85
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.590
I'm sure the rest.
So um,
there is,

86
00:05:05.591 --> 00:05:08.800
now we mentioned that talks about it and it's probably the gay his thing that's

87
00:05:08.801 --> 00:05:13.510
ever lived.
But I think the real worry is that,
not just like see it,

88
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.230
but do it like the going to be able to like the matrix,

89
00:05:17.231 --> 00:05:19.960
you going to be able to put this on and you're going to be able to like this

90
00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:22.960
haptic feedback suit that's just one step.

91
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.370
Eventually they're gonna figure out a way to make your body feel it and then

92
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.180
you're going to,
you're going to be able to have sex with people done.
Yeah.

93
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.200
Like anybody you want.

94
00:05:32.201 --> 00:05:34.980
Like you're never going to have to be nice to people again because everybody's

95
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.770
going to fuck you.
You know,
not,
that's one of the,
what am I,

96
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.660
my point was kind of on stage.

97
00:05:40.661 --> 00:05:43.990
Is that like one of the reasons why it's hard?

98
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.770
Like it's hard to have sex with people.
Like you have to plan it out.
I mean,

99
00:05:47.771 --> 00:05:52.630
it's not that hard,
but it's,
you know,
you have to agree that you like each other,

100
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.020
you know,
you have to hope that she likes you and you like her or whatever,

101
00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.260
and there's,
you develop your personality,

102
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.240
like to get people to like you more that way.
It's more likely be a nicer person.

103
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.650
You get rewarded for that and you realize,
oh,

104
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:09.500
it's nice to be a nice person and it actually makes you a nicer person.
Yeah.

105
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.170
If you don't have to do that in the future,

106
00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:16.790
we're going to be able to dress in a certain why and Cape hygienic and be nice.

107
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:18.260
And then,
yeah,

108
00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:21.350
everyone just turns into a fucking slob because they're gonna sleep with some

109
00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:24.440
pretty actress any law.
Yeah.
And in that virtual reality,

110
00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:26.130
they're going to look like Ryan Reynolds anyway.

111
00:06:26.131 --> 00:06:28.490
You're going to have a full six pack and look beautiful.

112
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.560
And then other people get to meet you in there.

113
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.520
They're also going to be pretending you're going to have some disgusting human

114
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:37.280
beings,
and then in that world they're going to be perfect.

115
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.520
But then there'll be people like me that I'm like,
Nah,
I'm traditional.
Yeah.

116
00:06:40.521 --> 00:06:44.390
I sleep with real,
real,
my wife.
Real humans.
Yeah.
Is that,

117
00:06:44.391 --> 00:06:46.460
that's going to be old school.
That's going to be like riding a bike.

118
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.950
Like what are you doing?
What's he doing?
Walk everywhere.
Uh,

119
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.210
it's crazy.
Yeah.
Ideas.
Uh,
I posted a photo,
a video actually,

120
00:06:56.211 --> 00:07:00.980
which is like 700 images stack together at Joshua tree.
I saw that.

121
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.290
Yeah.
And it's like the Milky Way,
Cruz and pos,

122
00:07:03.291 --> 00:07:08.030
but then there's just the air traffic dude.
He's in sign and shits like constant.

123
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.860
I'm like,
anyone look at in this muscle already looked like the future,

124
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.310
you know,
look so futuristic already.
And I'm like,
well,

125
00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:19.780
it sort of is maybe this like we're living in it now.
Here it is.
