1
00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.910
Her low freak bitches.

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.910
How many years after retiring from boxing is Floyd Mayweather broke?
Uh,

3
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.380
the,
I mean,
the Conor fight alarms me,
uh,
five,
five,
probably five.
Five.

4
00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:18.240
Does he know all the company has 46?
No.
None of that shit soon.

5
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.010
You don't think so?
[inaudible] comeback fight at 46.
Nah.
It's just too sad.

6
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.130
His Ego's too big in,
the market's not there anymore.

7
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.810
I think he tries to talk Conor McGregor into a rematch.
I'm not kidding.

8
00:00:30.811 --> 00:00:33.210
Do you see Conor statements about that?
No.
What he's saying,

9
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.600
he said I'd beat him in a rematch.
Adorable.
And I'll take God dammit.
Yeah.

10
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.180
Come on.
Well,
he would have to do something extremely different.

11
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.390
And his training,
no,
no,
no.
There's,
it's just not,
he's never beating May,

12
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.330
whether in a boxing match,
it's just not possible.
He was punching him hard.
Right.

13
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.000
It looked like a,
he clipped him with that one hard upper cut,

14
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:58.440
but it looks like he was pacing himself and in saving his energy,

15
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.080
it's just that it's just not the way to go.
I get what he's doing,

16
00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:05.790
but it's just not the way to go.
Yeah.
But if you're making $100 million,

17
00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:06.690
it's $100 billion.

18
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:09.420
If he could sucker people into doing it again for $100 million.

19
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.680
Well what do you think the UFC is?

20
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.220
What do you think the UFC is going to have to do?
Conor back?

21
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.360
Because Connor Connor had his movie premiere,

22
00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:22.350
which I guess destroy the box offices and not Ireland on a homie premiers they

23
00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:26.220
have out there,
but it's the biggest,
most successful Irish movie of all time.

24
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.320
That's so crazy.
Yeah.
Which is crazy.
Um,
but they so crazy.

25
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.490
They asked him what did you have to do?
He goes,
oh we're not,

26
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.780
I don't have bosses anymore.
What we have to be partners,
which is a legit point.

27
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.930
Yeah.
It's a legit point.
He's a different business entity.

28
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.440
But I think part of the point is going to be that he can't talk about it.

29
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.250
It's I agree.
I think the deal is going to happen and then you just like,
no,

30
00:01:47.251 --> 00:01:49.980
I'm fine.
Normal contract.
Cause UFC is like,
Yep,
we get it,
bitch.

31
00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:50.910
We're going to give you some money.

32
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.170
There's also the issue if you're negotiating that you go public with this

33
00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:57.840
negotiation like that.
You don't want to talk about that?
No.

34
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.870
I mean I guess he does for his brand because it makes them look like a super

35
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:02.910
ball.
They've got to pay corner now.

36
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.640
They can't just fucking keep wanting the same deal they had before.
Do you,

37
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.560
do you trust Conner not to say anything?
Well,
for Connor,

38
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.540
part thing is disclosing it.
It's part of his,

39
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.560
his swagger is how much money is what makes him Conor Mcgregor.

40
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.640
He's beating the game,
which is why we'd like to go.
Yeah,

41
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.160
it's go to be parody now.
Yeah.
It's got to have,
it can't be the order deal.
Yeah,

42
00:02:27.161 --> 00:02:30.840
it can be the older deal.
So you think they'd give him a apart?

43
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.200
I think if I was at UFC I would do what it takes to be in the Conor McGregor

44
00:02:36.271 --> 00:02:37.080
business.

45
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.750
Now I don't know what that means cause I don't know shit about business.

46
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.380
It means you're given a percentage of your company.

47
00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:46.200
You got to give up a percentage.
If you want a percentage.
Okay,

48
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.490
look at 94% like this movie.
Fucking fucking amazing.

49
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.110
It's fucking amazing.

50
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.060
94% it's out Friday and all the movie theaters here,
I don't know about all,

51
00:02:57.061 --> 00:03:01.660
but yeah,
I think a lot of them probably find those fucking 6% piece of Shite.

52
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.190
Jason through the streets of doable and just 6% and eight ds fans.
Yeah.

53
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:10.630
What is that about?
Who are these 6% fuck,
here's super haters,
right?

54
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.490
Pure haters.
Yeah.
Particulars.
So you're not getting the Nate fight.

55
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.630
Then if Tony and Conor fight,
say that again.

56
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.880
You're probably not getting the Nate fight any time soon.

57
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:26.050
If no cop cars team says to that Tony's the next fight,

58
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.860
which is management says that Dana says that.
So what do you do if your name,

59
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.340
I think they don't want to do an eight fight.
Who Does?
Oh,
Connor does it.
Ah,

60
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.170
I think,
ah,
I think they take,
Nate is a big fucking guy.
He's long.

61
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.500
He's a rough fight.
They had a for then Tony Ferg,

62
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.960
I think they're both rough fights there.
Bolt and neither one of them.

63
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.580
If I want to walk in the park,

64
00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:49.030
but after coming off of that real hard fight with Nate,

65
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.020
maybe he thinks Tony's easier to hit.
No.
Oh.
Although,

66
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.650
well he hit made a lot too though.
Yeah,
he did hit Nate a lot,
but,

67
00:03:56.651 --> 00:03:59.770
and it's at 55 but plot plus,
which is going to get more,

68
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.990
what's going to get more hype?
Nay.
I agree.
I agree.

69
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.670
But,
and he was here.
He'd argue you to be going crazy.
Tony's a star.

70
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.550
He's just super star.
I went to Eddie.
You got relax.
Yeah.
But you know,

71
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.930
Eddie trains him to totally understand.
I want to say the same thing.
Honestly.

72
00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:21.280
Want to see each fight equally.
I really do.
I don't have a favorite.

73
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.610
I would love to see Nate and Connor go at it again.

74
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.090
I would love to see Conor go at it with Tony.
I literally do not have a favorite.

75
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:30.190
I love both of those fights.
What happens if you only get,

76
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.280
you get one fight at a con,
kind of goes,
I'm only fighting once,
Tony,

77
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.840
I'm gonna let Joe Rogan be the guy on sides yet.
Tony Nader,
GSP.

78
00:04:37.841 --> 00:04:41.410
Tony Tony is,
we haven't seen him fight Tony before.

79
00:04:41.411 --> 00:04:42.700
We've seen him fight Nate twice.

80
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.090
GSP is such a long shot and it's a different weight class.

81
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.770
It's one 70 I mean that's all the GSP had talked about going to 55 at one point

82
00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:52.930
in time.
Do you remember that?
Yeah.
Yeah,
that would,

83
00:04:52.931 --> 00:04:55.150
that would take a long fucking time from,

84
00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.210
from the people who I know who are super close with George,

85
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.540
what they want is Woodley and then a super fight with Conor.

86
00:05:04.541 --> 00:05:07.090
That's their game plan.
Why do they want one thing?

87
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.090
70 champ going to vacate 85 [inaudible] 85 that make sense?

88
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.280
Dangerous fight.
Hell yeah,
but they're all dangerous.
All dangerous.
All of them.

89
00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.440
Everybody wants 70 months.
That's just unrealistic.

90
00:05:20.441 --> 00:05:23.950
They didn't happen in 70 makes more sense.
But look at what Dana said.

91
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.120
Don't call him a liar.
I'll call him right now.
Would you say he's in liar here.

92
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.740
He hates it.
Robert Whittaker here.
He hates me anyways,

93
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.440
so you can't get any worse.
So I don't give a fuck.

94
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.390
But I think he has to say that there's a lot of things where,
you know he's a PR.

95
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.430
Listen,
I know he's your friend,
but he's also a promoter.

96
00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:43.030
He's the best runner in the game,
right?
So he has to say certain stuff.

97
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.030
So there's just not a wild west.
Maybe George really wants a fight.

98
00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:48.160
Robert Whittaker.
It's entirely possible.

99
00:05:48.161 --> 00:05:51.490
George really likes it at one 85 who knows?

100
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.680
I Dunno.
Not Happening.
Yeah,
I don't know.
I don't know.
It's not like take it.

101
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.670
It's not like,
yeah,
I'll take it.
It's not like Dana's word is bond here where,

102
00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:04.130
you know,
he hasn't said outlandish shit before type of thing.

103
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.110
Let me ask you this.
What do you rather see?

104
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.310
You rather see him versus GSP versus Robert Whitaker or gs free versus Woodley?

105
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.650
Um,
God,
that's a great question.
I got my answer.
Yeah.

106
00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.220
Winokur right.
It's so fucking exciting cause we can knock his ass out,

107
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.940
knock anybody out.
And he's aggressive and he's,
he's very technical.

108
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.230
He's striking his fucking wicked.
He's wicked.
But would I rather see?
Yeah.

109
00:06:27.231 --> 00:06:32.000
I'd rather see Whitaker,
GSP,
if I,
if I'm on GSPS team,
he's fighting Woodley.

110
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.700
Really Wintergreen,
a fun fight for him.
I don't think either.

111
00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:37.920
If it's a fun fight for anybody,
neither is fun.
But at 85 there,

112
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.350
there's a lot his stem.
Uh,
there's a lot that it's just not fun for him.
Well,

113
00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:44.300
it's interesting because Robert Whitaker,

114
00:06:44.301 --> 00:06:48.170
the 185 pounds interim champ used to be 170 pound fighter as well,

115
00:06:48.171 --> 00:06:50.990
and he was stopped by Wonderboy.
Yeah,
that's true.

116
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.480
But he was draining himself to make one 70.
And Britta digger,
again,

117
00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:01.460
we're talking about a 26 year old guy who when he changed weight classes was

118
00:07:01.461 --> 00:07:06.410
probably only 23.
Right?
It was about three years ago.
Yeah.
This last loss,
right?

119
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.250
Yup.
Yeah.
He just couldn't make the weight training himself.

120
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.660
And it's harder to start when you're,

121
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:16.280
when you're older and he's pretty fucking stout at a,

122
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.120
at 185 pounds.
I mean,
he's not,
it's not small.
One 85.

123
00:07:20.121 --> 00:07:23.570
He's the fastest 85 in the world.
Were you shocked by,
um,

124
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.120
Musashi Musashi fight?
Uh,

125
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.130
think that shows you like how good the bell tour guys are.
Yes and no.
I do,

126
00:07:31.131 --> 00:07:33.470
I think bell tours at a level,
certain guys are level,

127
00:07:33.471 --> 00:07:37.970
but I think Musashi if here's the interview and he was actually pretty funny in

128
00:07:37.971 --> 00:07:40.190
it,
but he was like,
I had one fucking,
I'm it.

129
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.880
I literally had one night he closed my eye up so I was just going off instincts

130
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.050
and she'll Mancos very tough.
Very tough.
So I have one eye,
he stuffed.

131
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.980
That's what you get.
Yeah.
He caught him with one big clanger but he was,

132
00:07:51.981 --> 00:07:53.470
he was pulling the brand and fairway,

133
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.130
he was like before even gather and was like,

134
00:07:55.131 --> 00:07:59.690
I'm going to be champ at middle weight,
lightweight,
heavyweight and like,
oh,

135
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.290
I think everyone's going to go thug rose now.
I just want to be a good person.

136
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.610
Can't do this.
I want to be myself.
You can't do that.
Can kick your ass.

137
00:08:07.611 --> 00:08:10.410
And she's like our father who art in heaven help,
you know,
some scary shit.

138
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:15.410
Really got room for one.
Right.
She did it though.
I know,
man.
Very happy.
Me Too.

139
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:16.291
That left Hook was,

140
00:08:16.291 --> 00:08:19.940
that was the one of the most intriguing fights on the car to me.

141
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.520
I got to be on,
again,

142
00:08:22.521 --> 00:08:25.790
I've known rose and we have a history in Denver and we had the same coaches and

143
00:08:25.791 --> 00:08:29.190
I love rose and I bet on or just cause you're such a big underdog.
I,

144
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.320
and I predicted,
I thought she was gonna get,

145
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:34.790
she's going to be a lot of trouble because y'all hands just so goddamn
technical.

146
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:38.060
Yeah.
But I think Yolanda didn't respect her,

147
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:42.680
didn't she kinda overlooked her that that championship,
you know,
those,

148
00:08:42.681 --> 00:08:44.510
those obligations you have as a champion.

149
00:08:44.511 --> 00:08:47.570
I don't think people realize what comes with that.
You know,
a lot of people go,

150
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.790
everyone.
Yeah.
I think it was Dana said this or was run like,

151
00:08:49.791 --> 00:08:52.370
everyone wants to be a champ too.
You have to do championships shit,

152
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.250
which you got to sell the fight.
You're the reason why the paper view is selling.

153
00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:00.310
There's a lot that comes with that.
So,
and it's,
it's George retired because it,

154
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.930
he's like,
dude,
I can't relax man.
Yeah.
We don't get to see it very often too.

155
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.470
You know,
like we don't get to see it.
We see little clips here and there,

156
00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:09.030
but we don't know what their schedule's like.

157
00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:11.550
All the phone calls they have to manage all the interviews they have common or

158
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:14.100
talked about all day long.
I remember that he backed out of the,

159
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.040
when they wanted to do that fight,
he was like,
no,
fuck me.

160
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.720
I'm not doing all that media.
That's right man.
That's a killing me.

161
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.180
They were getting,
they pulled him from the car.
Yeah.
He was like,
cool,

162
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:22.980
I don't give a fuck.
I need to train.

163
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.710
Like you guys are having me do all this media circus stuff.

164
00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.020
I gotta focus on the fight man.
And He,

165
00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:30.870
and they put him through more energies and then anyone ever of course.

166
00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:35.550
Cause he's never met a camera.
He doesn't like and think that.
He was like,
no,
no,

167
00:09:35.551 --> 00:09:39.990
I'm going crazy.
I remember when him and although they did that world tour.
Yeah,

168
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:43.500
that was ridiculous,
man.
That world over,
over,
over easy.

169
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.890
How about the F and then the f the Floyd Mayweather tour?
That was,

170
00:09:46.891 --> 00:09:49.620
that schedule is nuts.
And I was just the commentator on that bitch.

171
00:09:49.621 --> 00:09:51.720
I was exhausted.
Yeah.
How crazy was that?

172
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.290
That tour where they would stand in front of her but even talk shit,

173
00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:59.040
I told that they shit after two cities.

174
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.090
It'd be tough for the best comics in the world.
Cup of new material,

175
00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:05.460
six nights in a row,
little loan.
These two fighters,

176
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.210
like the first two cities you saw,
they had their shit together.
It was fun.

177
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.150
Then after that third one is like,
what are we doing?
What do you think?

178
00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.760
What would they sell on tickets to that or they're giving it away for free.

179
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.700
I think they are giving them away,
but it was packed.

180
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.730
I've never seen some shit like that.

181
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:23.580
And how many different ones that you go to live?

182
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:27.410
I went to all of them stuff for London.
How many have with her?
I went to,
uh,

183
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:32.310
let's see,
I went to Los Angeles,
um,
New York and Toronto.

184
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:35.520
Dan,
they did London.
So I went on a Aa and the biggest,
what?
Toronto.

185
00:10:35.521 --> 00:10:38.160
I've never seen anything like it,
man.
Really?
Never.
Wow.

186
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:42.600
People hanging off the rafters to get a piece of his nuts.
Scary shifts.

187
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:46.320
No one like him.
It's weird.
You know there's a lot of great fighters right now,

188
00:10:46.321 --> 00:10:51.321
but there's no one that has the same enigmatic persona,

189
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.680
this fucking quality that makes everybody want to be around them.

190
00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.860
No one on the planet.
I just,
no one.
Even a close second.

191
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.580
There's never been a close second has the Nah,
Nah,

192
00:11:02.581 --> 00:11:04.320
like as far as like popularity,

193
00:11:04.321 --> 00:11:08.310
he's like the biggest by combat sports athlete ever because who else could go

194
00:11:08.311 --> 00:11:12.000
from one sport to the next the way he did?
No,
it was just perfect timing.

195
00:11:12.001 --> 00:11:16.920
Perfect style,
but the talent right now at 55 and 70 I again,

196
00:11:16.921 --> 00:11:19.140
I was looking at 70 I'm like,
oh my God,

197
00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.450
the EOC is operating at such a high level.
Talent wise,

198
00:11:21.451 --> 00:11:24.570
it's nuts in certain divisions,
other divisions.
It's Jesus guys.

199
00:11:24.571 --> 00:11:25.230
We need some line.

200
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:29.040
Do you think you could ever talk George and to fight and Connor a hundred

201
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.380
percent I'm telling you Joe at one 70 why?

202
00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:34.440
I'm telling you when I tell you my guys who are super close to George at their

203
00:11:34.441 --> 00:11:39.330
plan is Woodley Conner.
Now,
a lot has to happen and these guys are,

204
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:43.270
you know what I mean,
brother?
Amen.
Woodley Chi.

205
00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.070
If George comes back and beats Tyron Woodley,
first of all,

206
00:11:47.071 --> 00:11:50.670
that would submit him as the goat.
He's the goat already.
Let's be honest.

207
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:54.670
Who you coming back at 36 and winning the middleweight title,
moving up,

208
00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:59.620
finishing him,
finishing pound,
playing him asleep.
But it's still like,

209
00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:02.860
that's accomplishment goat versus like technique.
Goat technique.

210
00:12:02.861 --> 00:12:06.550
Goat is mighty mouse.
Who's landing last fight.
And you always go through that.

211
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.690
Nobody like that.
Look at George's resume.
Yeah.
And,
and,

212
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.490
and you're talking about non Usada days.
It's true.

213
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:16.420
When it was the wild fucking West.
That's creotine light.
That's a question.

214
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:21.220
No worries about creatine in the bag.
I gotta wrap this up.

215
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:31.380
<v 1>[inaudible]
okay.</v>
