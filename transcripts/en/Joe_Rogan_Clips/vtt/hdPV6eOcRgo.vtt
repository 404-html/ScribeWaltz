WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.240
No.
When you were in Alberta,

2
00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:05.740
you went back to that place that you were talking about on the first podcast we

3
00:00:05.741 --> 00:00:07.990
ever did,
where you had that encounter,

4
00:00:07.991 --> 00:00:11.560
where you shot that elk that was just outside of that wolf den and the wolf's

5
00:00:11.561 --> 00:00:15.640
tried to claim the elk.
Yeah,
I just had a shoot your way out of there.
Yeah.

6
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.960
Is a fucking crazy story.
What was it like to be back there again?

7
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.210
<v 1>Um,
it was,
what was strange about it is while we were there,</v>

8
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.030
uh,
I actually found that they were back in that area.

9
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.900
Um,

10
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.850
there was some fresh tracks and then we heard one how like during that thing.

11
00:00:36.851 --> 00:00:40.600
So it was almost like,
it was a little bit weird because,
um,

12
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.920
did you guys bring an extra bolts this time?
We only had my bow this time.

13
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.570
I'm sending you this Jamie.
Oh,
Geez.
Um,
but,
uh,
yeah,
the,

14
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.310
the thing that,
um,

15
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.810
the thing that was always kind of creeped me out a little bit was just,

16
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.393
it was,

17
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.530
I felt like I had like kind of a personal connection with that Alpha male

18
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.930
because of the way when,
you know,

19
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.940
he came in at the very end cause he wanted to know what the heck had taken out

20
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.080
three of his pack.
He wanted like,
it's almost like he's like,

21
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.440
I know we're getting out of here,
but I want to see this for myself because,

22
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.850
you know,
they were close enough but I don't think they could totally see us.

23
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.080
So as that was going away,
um,

24
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.690
<v 0>grizzly,
yeah.
It tells him look like a brown or a black bear though in the nose.</v>

25
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.110
Yup.

26
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.060
<v 1>See how the face is more narrow.
So yeah.
And then the cost to Yup.</v>

27
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.840
Yup.
Yeah.
Which like on the right foot,

28
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.660
the claw looks more like a black bear on the left foot.

29
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.010
There was some grass there that made it a little bit strange.

30
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.480
But,
um,
when that Alpha male came in to kind of,

31
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.490
you know,
I think he just wanted to know,
okay,
what's caused all this,
this stuff?

32
00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:58.650
So,
you know,
I looked at,

33
00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:01.650
I looked him in the face and just pretty much said I'm going to shoot you in the

34
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:06.450
face.
Um,
I always,
every time I go back in that area,
I'm like,

35
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:09.960
you know,
this old suckers walking around,
he knows my smell.

36
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.910
He's probably going to be like,
there's that.
Yeah.
I personally,
they are smart.

37
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.380
I could picture him remembering it and saying,
okay,

38
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.630
<v 0>oh,
okay,
this,
I owe this.
Do I owe this dude?</v>

39
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.040
And then make him into a hero.
He turd on the side.
Yeah.
I sent you that,
uh,

40
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.950
that Wolf Big Wolf Shit that had porcupine quills all that.

41
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.370
I put that on Instagram.

42
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.410
<v 1>It's funny how many people were like that.
That is not porcupine.</v>

43
00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:41.880
Quills it's like,
listen,
people,
I'm in the outdoors 200 days,

44
00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:46.230
probably a year.
And if there's porcupine quills coming out of a pile of Shit,

45
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.270
I'm pretty sure I did.
I know

46
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.670
<v 0>what it is.
It's hard to tell from a photo</v>

47
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.600
on my Instagram.
Jerry,
here we go.
It's a,

48
00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.100
a pile of shit with porcupine quills in it.
Imagine how God damn

49
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.020
<v 1>hungry you have to be to be eaten.</v>

50
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:05.950
Porcupine quills and swelling going wolf's that tough.
He doesn't care.

51
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.640
It's like a bear.
Look at how many bears just,

52
00:03:08.641 --> 00:03:13.641
we'll just go head first into a pile and like a fire ant bed or a or a wasp ness

53
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.590
like yellow jacket.
It is make that a little bigger please.

54
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.360
Down in the bottom you can see some nice quills.
Yeah,
yeah.

55
00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:23.920
Some people would go though.
It's her.

56
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.640
And the other is there is porcupine here in their correct.

57
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.570
But those are also quilts.
There's,
there's a couple of blood drops up there.

58
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.000
It needs some prep age.
Um,
how are we,
yeah,
they're,

59
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:40.600
they're obese.
They're beast.
That is,
you know,
I th I think,

60
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.310
I think their intelligence,
their intelligence level is,
is super high.

61
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.230
I think a lot of,
you know,

62
00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:52.231
the more you're in the outdoors and you experience things demeanors and their,

63
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:56.080
uh,
their ability to survive.
You know,
you look at,
uh,
one of the,

64
00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.280
you look at an old grizzly that's been in those woods for 20 years,

65
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.670
think of the experience level that thing has surviving every single day.

66
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.020
I mean,
every day just maybe making a slight mistake,

67
00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:12.310
slipping up a little bit,

68
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.030
almost getting jacked by another grizzly and then you're like,
oh,
Yep,

69
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.700
I know not to do this.
I know not to do that.
I mean,

70
00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:22.930
they're there until their intelligence level and their ability to function is

71
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:25.900
extremely high and wolves are,
I mean,

72
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.930
arguably wolves probably get shot less than probably any of the other animals.

73
00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:36.190
I mean,
they're,
they are incredibly smart.
So,
yeah,

74
00:04:36.191 --> 00:04:40.380
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't doubt it.
You know,
it was,
um,
and they're,
they,

75
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.050
they were very,
after that,
they were very,
um,

76
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.650
intent in that area for people to,

77
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.730
they put up some pretty big bounties on the wolves and they really went after

78
00:04:51.731 --> 00:04:52.071
him and,

79
00:04:52.071 --> 00:04:57.071
and knock those herds down quite a bit because there was very few mule deer,

80
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.300
like very few mule deer,
you'd hardly see a doe and Fon.

81
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.250
They had to cut the number of tags way down,
uh,
elk as soon as wolves.

82
00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:11.251
Like how at night if a pack moves into an area and they how like calling elk is

83
00:05:11.621 --> 00:05:14.680
just nonexistent.
They just,
everything's just like,

84
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.300
don't say nothing cause you know,
they're here.
Um,
so yeah,

85
00:05:19.301 --> 00:05:23.680
I think,
I think them thinning them down was,
was very relevant.

86
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.970
And since then,
which was quite awhile ago,
um,

87
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.900
the numbers of like elk and Moose,
like this past year,

88
00:05:31.901 --> 00:05:34.390
I saw way more moose than I've seen.
Um,

89
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.180
I think they're really hard on Moose Fonz.
Um,

90
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.400
and yeah,
I mean,
Moose Mulally's white tails.

91
00:05:42.401 --> 00:05:46.720
I saw way more animals this year than in the past up there.

92
00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:51.220
And I think it's just because that Moose number or the wolf number was just much

93
00:05:51.221 --> 00:05:53.890
lower.
Um,
but there was,
like I said,

94
00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:57.560
there was still signed that there was some in the area,
just nothing.

95
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.510
Like several years ago when I was there,
it was,
you know,

96
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.320
it was even,
I would say,
as much as I appreciate balance in nature,

97
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.580
it was excessive and it's getting that way now.

98
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.020
Like even in Wisconsin,

99
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.340
I remember I was talking to a friend of mine up in an area I used to live up by

100
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.260
kind of in the Lacrosse area,

101
00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:21.920
actually lived a little northeast of Lacrosse by a small town called cataract.

102
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.710
And there was a few times where there was some wolf spottings.

103
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.150
Um,
there is a big military base here called Fort Mccoy and I lived up on the

104
00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:35.390
northern side of the base,
um,
what was called the impact area.

105
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:40.420
They kind of shot test rounds over and they kind of went off there or whatever,

106
00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:45.260
but there was an incredible number of like deer and things that were in there.

107
00:06:45.261 --> 00:06:46.280
So,
you know,

108
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.960
kind of the rumor was that they had introduced wolves into their timber wolves

109
00:06:50.961 --> 00:06:51.794
to let,

110
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.040
to kind of thinned down some of those numbers will now it's to the point where

111
00:06:55.041 --> 00:06:59.360
the amount of people I know in Wisconsin that sea wolves is just rapidly

112
00:06:59.361 --> 00:07:04.220
increasing.
And obviously when that happens,
you know,
they eat stuff.
I mean,

113
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:09.020
wolves don't mess around,
they take stuff down and sometimes it's just strange.

114
00:07:09.021 --> 00:07:11.510
You don't understand the balance of um,

115
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.280
of why there's an introduction to something that,
you know,

116
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.240
has the possibility to just take over.
You know,
it's,
it's strange.

117
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.640
<v 0>Well,
it is,
but it's also,
there needs to be some sort of balance.</v>

118
00:07:23.641 --> 00:07:28.641
You don't want the animals overpopulating and you do want some sort of a balance

119
00:07:29.071 --> 00:07:30.690
between Predator and prey.

120
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:35.990
But the real problem becomes when people don't want to manage the predators,

121
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:40.860
right.
They only want,
they want nature to sort itself out.
Yeah.

122
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.530
This is,
it doesn't really work that way though.
I mean,

123
00:07:43.531 --> 00:07:45.510
it's just people need to understand,

124
00:07:45.511 --> 00:07:49.200
like if you do like deer and you like Mousse and you like all these other

125
00:07:49.201 --> 00:07:53.920
animals,
you can't have too many wolves cram too many.
Yeah.

126
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.670
You can't have too many grizzlies because if you do,

127
00:07:56.671 --> 00:07:58.920
you're going to have very few of those other animals.

128
00:07:58.921 --> 00:08:00.690
You're not going to see them.
They're going to get wiped out.
