WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.871
But when we were done,

2
00:00:00.871 --> 00:00:03.520
Chappelle should have the Chappelle show after second year.

3
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.730
We weren't really making a lot of money or special cause the show still hadn't

4
00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:12.300
been proven.
You know how something you got to,
if you've got a contract,

5
00:00:12.301 --> 00:00:14.970
you've got contract.
That's it.
Just so happened to cotton.

6
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.930
Does the show blew up before the contract was over?

7
00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:20.540
But that don't mean nobody's going to renegotiate.

8
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.090
So we had this popular but we weren't making money.
And um,

9
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.920
I came with the idea that doing a tour called the I'm rich bitch tour and at the

10
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:33.660
time,
at the time Charlie was China,
like anywhere it goes.

11
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.650
At the time bill burr was um,
uh,

12
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.190
a headliner probably at the time and be rooms,
you know what I'm saying?

13
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.880
And this is no disrespect to him,
but he was on the come up.
Right.

14
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.040
But when you saw bill,
you knew this muffle,
it was going to be next.

15
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.470
You knew he was going,
he was going to pop it,

16
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.120
but we still wasn't getting no cash.
Charlie had never told jokes and I was like,

17
00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:56.310
how the fuck you around all these communities?
You never been on stage.

18
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.630
So I used to bully him.
You know,
he tough ass motherfucker,
rest in peace.

19
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.250
But I was like,
yeah,
you're so tough.

20
00:01:02.251 --> 00:01:04.110
Motherfuck but not with a microphone in your hand.

21
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.420
And I bullied them so much that he finally went on stage and Charlie with the

22
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.430
tour was Charlie would mc and all we needed him to do was 10 or 15 minutes at a

23
00:01:15.421 --> 00:01:18.360
time.
Me and Charlie outside of the day were to pop up people on the show.

24
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.690
Bill Burr had a couple of sketches per bill burden pop off of the show.
And I,

25
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.550
and I was like,
but if we're going to do this,
let's have a fire show.

26
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.030
You know what I mean?
Don't we could put somebody's weak in the middle.
I said,

27
00:01:30.031 --> 00:01:33.090
let's give him a show that they won't ever forget.

28
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.950
And Charlie used to come out to 10 15 minutes and I tell people they,
I was like,

29
00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:40.620
who's the toughest person to follow?

30
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.910
But Charlie would go through 10 15 minutes and Bill Burger would come out and do

31
00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:47.880
20 to 25 and then I came behind bill.

32
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.090
Not One night for a year,

33
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.970
a whole year and bill burns or type of act.
You have no days off.

34
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.820
You have no or any of that,
any,

35
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.520
any little inkling of being off years going here.
Yeah,
I liked the show,

36
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.380
but the white dude was funny as a mother.
I didn't know.
And He,
and um,

37
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.470
you can tell her that time that Bill Byrd was going to be a star,

38
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.250
whether it would have been movies or television,
but as a stand up,
you know,

39
00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:19.980
he was one of the pound for pound,
one of the dopest to do it.

40
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.850
And I told went off for a fucking year.
We had a blast.
Yeah.
Bill's brilliant.
Uh,

41
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.830
I got to work with Charlie for,
we did this maxim tour.
We did like 22 dates.

42
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.890
Me and him and John Heffron,
we traveled all over the place.
Does it,

43
00:02:31.891 --> 00:02:35.190
when Charlie was starting to do it,
it was,
he kind of,
he's like two years in,

44
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.540
he was two years at the time.
And you know,
people joke,

45
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.590
people don't understand how tough it is to start as a comedian has a famous

46
00:02:43.471 --> 00:02:46.110
person as a comedian that you're basically,

47
00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:50.580
you're open miker does selling out all across the country.
And not only that,

48
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.790
but you're Eddie Murphy's brother.

49
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.780
So you got to fight past all of that shit,
creating your own identity.

50
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.860
You know what I'm saying?
Like I could not imagine like the heat he probably had.

51
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.680
Yeah.
But he ain't Eddie Murphy,
Eddie Murphy.

52
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.750
And that's one of the things that when Charlie passed that I really appreciated

53
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.450
about what the Chappelle show different him,
because when he passed away,

54
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.010
nobody said Eddie Murphy's brother died.
Right.
Everybody's like,

55
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.250
Charlie Murphy's passed away.
So he had his true identity.

56
00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:25.100
And that was Charlie Murphy.
Yeah.
And that was one of his bits.
You know,
the,

57
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.390
you know,
is it,
does it piss you off or people y'all [inaudible] had?
He goes,
no,

58
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.140
I'm just having to not call me Eddie Murphy's brother anymore.
It was fun.

59
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.170
I remember that.
That was,
that was,

60
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.890
that was a joke and addressed it.
And He's capable.
And He,
and,

61
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.700
and he found himself,
he got better,
he got better.

62
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.960
And then he carved his own lane.
He called his,
he calls his own lane.
Did.

63
00:03:46.961 --> 00:03:51.910
I was with Maury Smith used to be the UFC heavyweight champion and a Ivan

64
00:03:51.911 --> 00:03:52.571
salivary.

65
00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:54.910
He was a guy who fought in the middleweight division in the UFC and a couple

66
00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:59.270
other professional fighters at a table with Charlie Murphy and trial.

67
00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.770
He was explaining how none of these motherfuckers know how to do a Chicago Ridge

68
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:05.620
hand karate shit.
Oh,

69
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:09.670
he was big on like Charlie Murphy's holding court,

70
00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:13.260
standing up all these UFC fighters and standing back and Charlie Murphy,

71
00:04:13.261 --> 00:04:15.270
he's talking about rich hand isn't talking about it.

72
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.260
He knew exactly what he's talking about.
He knew how to fight for sure.
I had,

73
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.360
he had,
he would,
he'd never knew martial arts.
He was,
um,

74
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.430
he was big into it years ago.

75
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.840
He used to be on at his body guy when Eddie was like right at the height of his

76
00:04:28.841 --> 00:04:32.230
stuff.
But um,
Charlie was like martial arts,

77
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.500
but everything that he said,
it was the truth.
You know what I mean?
You,

78
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.110
you didn't feel it like,
oh,
this dude is lying.

79
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.710
Everything he said it was true and one of the most genuine people you want to

80
00:04:41.711 --> 00:04:46.000
meet man.
Just a dope guy.
Yeah,
his karate lineage.

81
00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:49.970
Like he has some sort of a connection to some of my friends I'd have to ask them

82
00:04:49.971 --> 00:04:53.640
to,
but he was like a legit martial artist too.
I saw one video of him in a,

83
00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.690
in a martial arts contest and it was,
I dunno,
I dunno.
I always tell him,

84
00:04:58.691 --> 00:05:02.410
I was like,
Yo,
you knocked a 14 year old.
Right.
I don't know how he,

85
00:05:02.411 --> 00:05:05.020
I don't know if it was a way to whatever it was.
And I was like,
Yo,

86
00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:07.450
that was a fucking kid you just knocked out.
He was like,
Yo,

87
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.950
anybody in the rink or fucking get it?
He was Yo,

88
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.150
he was putting kids in with them.
I don't know.
He never,
I saw the video.

89
00:05:16.151 --> 00:05:18.980
He never wanted me to talk about it.
Whatever.
I used to bust his balls about him.

90
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:20.230
I could tell.

91
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.370
I could tell being around him that he legitimately knew how to fight.
Yeah.
Kinda.

92
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.670
You can tell the way he carries himself.
He just had deco,
that scowl.

93
00:05:27.671 --> 00:05:31.030
He just looks like that buddy was the one of the nicest guys,

94
00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:35.440
Matt and he was so fun to be around like in not knowing him at all and then

95
00:05:35.441 --> 00:05:39.790
traveled with him for 22 days.
We had so much fun man.
Oh Man.

96
00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:44.791
The stories all just laughing and silly and super friendly and all he wanted to

97
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:49.510
do is man just have a,
have a good time and laugh.
Yup.

98
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.500
That's all he wanted to and talk shit and talking shit to me all the time and

99
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.940
was so happy to be able to do stand up.

100
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.130
That was a big thing for him that he could do stand up and travel.

101
00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.480
Always tell him.
I tell him all the time,
I said,
birth your career dude.

102
00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.800
I bullied them into the shit.
That's hilarious.
But he did it.
But you could tell.

103
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:08.540
You can tell.

104
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.880
And I've been around him and I've been around his family and you could tell when

105
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:12.590
he was growing up,

106
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.570
he was the guy that always had the center of attention.

107
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.000
You can just tell it.
Yeah,

108
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.800
you could tell he knows how to hold a story as he does.

109
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.850
That was a hard one,
man.
When he,
when he passed I was like,
whoa.

110
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.320
I didn't know he was sick.
I had no idea.
You know,

111
00:06:30.321 --> 00:06:35.321
it's interesting that you say that because I had to continue to do shows,

112
00:06:36.621 --> 00:06:37.850
do radio interviews and stuff.

113
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.030
And the thing that people kept saying was he was so young,

114
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.890
he was so young and he was young.
But um,

115
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.580
I don't believe that we're all going to live to be 80,

116
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.190
90 a hundred.
You know,

117
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.690
only thing we all guarantee when we're born,
we have are born date.

118
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.120
We have that dash in the middle and then we have the end and it comes down to

119
00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:06.410
what the fuck do you do with your dash?
Yeah.
How,
how hard did you live?

120
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.460
What did you go for?
What inspired you,
what motivates you?

121
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:11.750
What did you do with that dash?

122
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.890
Who the fuck gives a fuck about living to 100 and you don't have a passport,

123
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.000
you haven't been outside of your block,
you haven't been,

124
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.620
you haven't never been on an airplane.
What are you doing with your life?

125
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:26.950
And I know Charlie from the point of being in the navy to a band with his

126
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.010
brother,
sent his brother,
reached certain height of success,

127
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.000
be an interested in about it,
interested in the business,
but you know,

128
00:07:35.001 --> 00:07:38.420
kind of India but never really major mark.

129
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:43.100
And then you get a platform that you become,
he gets your identity and shit.

130
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.070
That's the dopest shit.
Yes.

131
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:49.970
It's one of the best kind of success stories because it doesn't happen

132
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.930
automatically.
It's that Frank Sinatra and I did it my way and it's like,

133
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:58.530
you know,
people say what they want to say,
but he put the work in that.

134
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:03.290
I remember when,
um,
I think the movie Eddie did called Norbit right.

135
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:08.420
And it came from a joke.
Charlie had just started with that movie.

136
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:12.520
And I guess I think him and it was talking,
whatever,
and then you know how like,

137
00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:15.530
oh,
that could be [inaudible] could be movie and motherfucker.

138
00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.620
Charlie come and say,
Yo man,
I've handguns moved here.
I said,
what you build?

139
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:19.640
What you about to do?
