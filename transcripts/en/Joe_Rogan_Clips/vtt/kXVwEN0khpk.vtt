1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.090
Dress the way you want to address.
It's not their problem,
it's the guy's problem.

2
00:00:03.091 --> 00:00:05.790
Let's correct the guys rather than us.
Right.
I love that.

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.780
But there's a lot of guys that haven't been corrected yet who are going to

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.770
hassle you and follow you in the parking lot.
That's the problem.

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.740
Those guys aren't woke once.
Everyone's all,
whoa.
It will be great.

6
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.150
Dangerous word to use.
I feel like people are gonna mock it in the future.

7
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.460
Woke woke.
Yeah.

8
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.370
I feel like using woke now like unironically super slippery.

9
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.210
I see a trap coming.
You do.
Did you Jitsu practitioner in me.

10
00:00:30.211 --> 00:00:33.690
It's like I don't like this move and this is a,
I know where this leads

11
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.150
me.
Right?
That's how I feel.
Yeah,
I see that woke thing.
I'm like,

12
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:43.200
what are you woke?
What the fuck does that even mean?
I woke up,
you woke up,

13
00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:47.040
what do you 12 well he comes from my 16 year old.
So yeah,

14
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.440
it's kids today.
But what does work mean?
It means your brain is open.

15
00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:54.570
You're open to stuff.
Your problem is,

16
00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:58.950
there's no real quantification.
There's no real,

17
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.210
there's no test you tank to show that if you're woke.
Right.
Right.

18
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.850
Like if you want to be a mathematician,

19
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.250
you have to fucking show that you know how to do math.

20
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.510
The professor say check your work.
Like you get through like yes,

21
00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:15.690
congratulations Tom Papa.
Yeah,
you are a mathematician.

22
00:01:15.691 --> 00:01:19.170
You know phd in mathematics says right here on the paper and you're like,

23
00:01:19.171 --> 00:01:21.480
God damn it,
I'm going to put that shit on my walls.
You understand?

24
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.970
I know how this stuff works.
Yeah.

25
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.570
But wokeness anybody can claim to be a master of wokeness.

26
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.170
It's like Kung Fu without fighting.
It's very dangerous.

27
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.060
No one's defined what's woke and what's preposterous.
No one's defined what's,

28
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.150
what's just not racist and not success and not homophobic,

29
00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:41.390
but open minded and aware of the,
the,

30
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.350
the failings and the misgivings of all sides with no bias.
Right.

31
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.140
Is that what,
cause it doesn't seem like it is,
isn't that woke?
I don't know.

32
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.630
I don't think so.
I think you just described what I thought it was.

33
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.630
I would like that,
but too many people could jump in.
There's no,

34
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.840
there's no real clear understanding of like what makes in constitutes someone

35
00:02:00.271 --> 00:02:01.320
being walked like,
yeah.

36
00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:04.500
How many of those boxes do you have to check where it was like a lap.

37
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.290
Tom Papa had a woke academy and you took these people through.

38
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.661
It would just be,

39
00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:14.340
do you like bread or not like bread claiming wokeness super slippery.

40
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.040
What's his Jamie?
62 New York Times magazine already woke

41
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.260
crazy.
God Dig it.
Look,
if you're woke,
you dig it.
Oh,

42
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.430
that's the perfect definition right there.
[inaudible] if you're woke,
you dig it.

43
00:02:29.431 --> 00:02:32.340
That is insane.
That was my fox man.

44
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.480
And you were copying my taste and grit.
What?

45
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.950
Don't jump salty on me.
Whoa.
Look,
how have they talked back then?

46
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.120
They were trying to talk people into talking to way that made them seem more

47
00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:49.450
interesting.
I'm going to say it the way I would say if I lived back then,
hey,

48
00:02:49.451 --> 00:02:52.320
could you make it bigger so I can see it?
You'll be the guy on the left.

49
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.770
No scrolling.
So we could read the comments.
Yeah.
What he's saying up top.

50
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.840
Yeah.
That was,
that was my facts man.

51
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.840
And you were counting Matt tasting,
grace and grit.
So how would you say that now?

52
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.240
Um,
that was my fox man comping my tasting grid.

53
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.320
Of course it's girl.
That's my girl.
That's what he's saying.
No,

54
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:20.910
that's what they said.
Oh,
would you use,
what words would you use today?
Yeah.
Yeah.

55
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.070
He would say,
the fuck are you doing with my girlfriend,
dickhead?

56
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.510
And he said,
don't jump salty on me.
I would say,
hey,

57
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.690
we're cool.
No worries.
No worries.
Stop being such a bitch.
It's all good.

58
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.670
It's all good.
Yeah.
And then it'd be like,
what?
Oh,
someone's a badge.

59
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.110
And then next thing you know,
people be hitting each other.
That's a darkness.

60
00:03:43.111 --> 00:03:47.380
No men.
Who are these two gentlemen to the risers?
The,
it says no Webster.

61
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:49.360
I think that might be like Webster's dictionary.

62
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.860
I Peter one Peter in the,
in the dictionary.

63
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:58.630
That's squirly if you feel like the letters are all blurred.
Right.

64
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.490
I love that.
I love that.
If you're woke,
you'll dig it.
Yeah.
If you're woke,

65
00:04:03.491 --> 00:04:07.960
you dig it.
That's,
that sums it up,
man.
If you're woke,
you dig it.

66
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.490
And after,
how'd you find this Jamie?
Come back to that.
Uh,

67
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.510
it's like know your meme.
Oh Wow.
So the meme of the word woke?
Yeah.

68
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.680
Wow.
Look at that little image though.
Scroll Bar Graphs where we see that again,

69
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.220
that's so strange.
Like I'm batch,
if that was contemporary,

70
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.570
like if that was your world,

71
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:28.900
like imagine if hipsters all of a sudden started wearing tails.
So their jackets,

72
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.510
they just decided this is the next level or the bow ties and those tails.

73
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.810
It wouldn't be surprising cause that's all about just doing what you guys don't

74
00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:44.720
do.
So I'm going to Hales.
What a weird look though.
It is.

75
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.690
That is so weird.
That's a look that like,
okay,
so like the guy in the center,

76
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.720
it's like those two guys,
both of the guys in the center.

77
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.910
Those guys will fly today.
Oh totally.

78
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.700
The guy in the left that looks like he's dressed like he's a,

79
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.530
that looks like me on the road.
Yeah.
I mean,
but he looks like,
look,

80
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.840
he's in a Quentin Tarantino movie or something.
It looks like he's reservoir dog.

81
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.690
That's totally normal.
The matrix black suit tie that'll door.

82
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.240
I can go to any restaurant anywhere and no one would even bat an eye like,

83
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.820
Oh sir,
can I help you?
Boom.

84
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.890
Right in image the guy next to him.
But those two guys on the ends,

85
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.970
like what in the fuck are they?
He's got a coat with towels.
Yeah.

86
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.290
And those pants that are like flat across your crotch where it looks like give

87
00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:31.000
no privates.
Here's good way to look at it.

88
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.410
Imagine if you're dating a gal and a prepass is going to come over and you're

89
00:05:35.411 --> 00:05:39.370
like,
you're really gonna love my dad.
He's an amazing guy.
He's real old school.

90
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.810
Jack comes up with a dress like that with coattails and you start feeling like

91
00:05:46.811 --> 00:05:51.100
you're like,
you're in that movie.
Get Out.
He's gay.
He's got a handlebar mustache.

92
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.630
He's got tails.
Yeah.
Weird weird pants with the go into funny shoes.
You see,

93
00:05:55.631 --> 00:05:59.240
get out.
Yeah.
I finally watched it during sober October.
Oh,

94
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:01.190
you did fucking fantastic.
Yeah,

95
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.540
but that's what you'd be thinking if that guy was dressed like that,

96
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.560
that the daughter was going to lead you to something.

97
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:07.610
And you have to run for your life.

98
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.030
But it is weird how like that suit has lasted.
Yeah,
a long time.

99
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.481
Well,

100
00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:19.370
this was 1960 so I'm assuming that it was mocking the style of old,

101
00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:21.890
so by the time 1960 rolled around,
the guys in the middle,

102
00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:24.220
we're dressed contemporary,
but the guys at the end,

103
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.950
like making fun of people the way they used to dress kind of in a way,

104
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.780
or at least that's what represents those people.
Yeah.
It just defines their time.

105
00:06:32.781 --> 00:06:36.210
That guy was probably around the 18 hundreds and it's just one of the floors.

106
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.580
Other guys are,
do you know who those guys are?
I believe no.

107
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.550
Webster.
Webster Addiction.

108
00:06:42.551 --> 00:06:44.750
That's why he's got the pen and he's scratching his head.

109
00:06:44.751 --> 00:06:46.700
Is that guys putting out his slang?

110
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.720
His slang is making Webster's what the fuck?
He's like,

111
00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:54.110
that's not how you really say it.
So it'd be like the urban dictionary,

112
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.840
like a w Jamie and I sometimes get confused.
We have to pull up the urban decks,

113
00:06:57.841 --> 00:07:00.350
try and find out what the real word of a word means.

114
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.220
So let's pull up woke represented today.

115
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.600
You know what,
no disrespect,

116
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.760
no cultural appropriation intended.

117
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.470
The fact that it was invented actually in the 60s it was really weird.

118
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.110
It's just making a comeback,
looking around when I typed in,

119
00:07:18.111 --> 00:07:21.160
like what does it work to see if there's anything,
if you dig it,
you will.

120
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.850
What's it saying were knowledgeable about your community in the world with the

121
00:07:25.851 --> 00:07:29.600
willingness to access and critique systems of oppression?

122
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:34.730
Uh,
well that the ambulance parked the last Carl.
Yeah,
exactly.
Yes.

123
00:07:34.731 --> 00:07:38.270
I mean for sure if it really is a system of oppression,

124
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:43.640
but how do we decide what's a system of oppression and what is sounds like any

125
00:07:43.641 --> 00:07:46.220
Jordan Peterson,
weird human behavior

126
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.890
represents then what do you mean interact with each other on a grand scale?

127
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.020
I mean,
that's just like I,

128
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.450
there are some legitimate systems of oppression,
right?
Yeah.
For Real.

129
00:07:59.451 --> 00:08:03.770
It's like figuring out which one it is.
Yeah.
Before,

130
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.520
but putting that and like,
that's what woke is like,
how do you do,

131
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.090
how do you define what the system's like?
Where does it,

132
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.760
where's the line get drawn?
Right,
right.
It's the line.
Hmm.

133
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:20.990
Like,
why do women,
uh,
kept certain jobs?
Why do men have short and jobs?

134
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.150
How much of that is because of influence?

135
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.860
How much of that is because of their choices?

136
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:29.360
How much of that it's just because of natural proclivities towards certain

137
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:30.330
things.
Well,

138
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:34.670
then you're talking about people that are coming after the hierarchy and if

139
00:08:34.671 --> 00:08:36.060
they're coming up through the hierarchy,

140
00:08:36.061 --> 00:08:38.940
who's to say that those people are in part of the problem?

141
00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.540
I love Jordan Peterson.
The,
it's just like hammers.
Just,

142
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.260
well then what do you want?
What are you saying then?
Who are you?
What do,

143
00:08:46.261 --> 00:08:49.310
what are you,
you,

144
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:54.480
It's just love like the exasperations in his ways.
No,
but it's true.
It's like,

145
00:08:54.481 --> 00:08:57.990
then this true,
but that woke definition was like,
oh,
I'm with you.

146
00:08:57.991 --> 00:09:01.080
This is all about being nice and kind.
And then at the end it's about attacking.
