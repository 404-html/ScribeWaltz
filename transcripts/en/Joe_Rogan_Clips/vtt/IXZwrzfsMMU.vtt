1
00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.590
Her low freak bitches.
And before I forget,

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.040
the reason I wanted to show that video was I got you something.
This is Leo,

3
00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:12.090
may his wife.
So you have the,
you have the,
the knife from Leo May,

4
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.820
his wife made you this right here.

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.780
And so because from our second GRE episode I believe,

6
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.590
uh,
we funded a water well there in Bofi and so,
uh,

7
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.990
she's really talented.
Um,

8
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.860
I mean it might not look like too much here,
but uh,
that's cool.

9
00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:35.850
What does that mean?
It's bark cloth.
So it's a tree bark cloth.

10
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:38.340
And when they take the bark off the trees,
fine.

11
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.890
But the a that used to be what?

12
00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:44.010
They would make their clothing out of their clothing.

13
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:46.220
They would make other materials out of them.
Uh,

14
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.890
they can make these little kind of carrying cases or backpacks kind of out of
it.

15
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.240
They treat it with something like,
how do they get it so soft?
They pound it down.

16
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.800
And I haven't seen the whole process,

17
00:00:55.801 --> 00:01:00.000
but I've seen the bark and where they pull it off and then they kind of beat it

18
00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:03.000
down and beat it down until it's this like cloth.

19
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.740
I know that this right here when I've been doing research,
they have those pygmy,

20
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.550
uh,
boothy pygmy paintings that are made out of bark cloth at Lake,

21
00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:14.450
our National Museum of history in New York.
Um,

22
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.500
they have a few of these there and so it's Kinda cool to see.
I Dunno.
I just was,

23
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.840
uh,
was excited to bring it back to you

24
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.360
said painting and um,
it's,
it's Mama Leo May and she's,
uh,

25
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.160
she's painting it for Esl.
That's awesome man.
Thank you.
Thank her.
Please.
I will.

26
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.430
That's so cool.
How will they just have,
when I go back sometimes they're like,

27
00:01:35.431 --> 00:01:38.460
hey,
well that's you're making it there.
I think your friends.
Yeah.

28
00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:40.710
So that one's not the same one.

29
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:44.160
I actually didn't think to or I didn't get picture of it whenever she was

30
00:01:44.161 --> 00:01:46.650
picking this one,
but I got a picture of her doing some other ones.

31
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.440
That's Mama's Yz and uh,
she's pretty great at it as well.
And,

32
00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:55.170
um,
so they just,
uh,
yeah,

33
00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:59.280
I mean that's a little bowl we'll leafs this paint that you actually have there

34
00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:01.830
was,
they had some leftover black paint,

35
00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:06.420
but sometimes on that other photo they just use like cassava or berries and they

36
00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:10.170
beat it up a pound it down and make this paint out of it,

37
00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:14.190
but it kind of fades over time.
So this one's one where,
yeah,
that's,

38
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.450
that's it right there where they just pound up this stuff and it's part of their

39
00:02:18.451 --> 00:02:20.250
culture.
It's what they love to do.

40
00:02:20.251 --> 00:02:23.880
They kind of how he saw Leo may pass them down,
uh,
you know,

41
00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:28.680
the farming and that video was actually San g over here from the hand print
that,

42
00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:31.980
yeah,
he got his grandson.
Um,

43
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.520
and this is what the women pass down to their girls is how to make the spark

44
00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:40.470
cloth and how to,
um,
how to paint.
So it's pretty neat.
Their culture,

45
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.160
like they just do everything together.
They rally around each other,

46
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.700
they're happy together,
they sing,
they dance,
but they also suffer together.

47
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.120
If one person in the community is lost,
even for instance,
uh,

48
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.370
it might sound weird in our culture,

49
00:02:53.371 --> 00:02:58.200
but let's say a mother passes away who's like,
she's breastfeeding,
right?

50
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.610
And she passes,
but the baby survives.

51
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.690
Some other woman in the village will take the baby up and start taking care of

52
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:09.590
that little one.
And,
um,
there is an adoption in the pygmy culture.
Like you,

53
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.080
no one,
no one needs to be adopted because the community rallies around them when

54
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:16.780
someone's lost,
they all mourned the death together,

55
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.250
but then they rally around that family and see how they can all help and put in.

56
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.490
So it's pretty cool.
I love it.
I've,

57
00:03:23.491 --> 00:03:26.680
I've learned a lot from him was that's how people used to be,
man.
That's,

58
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.510
that's the original sort of tribal life of human beings.
They,

59
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.310
they would all raise each other.
Christopher Ryan had this whole,
um,
uh,

60
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.110
take on it in sex at dawn,
you know,
and,

61
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.720
and Mckenna had a take on it as well.
Uh,

62
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.070
where they were talking about these ancient cultures.
They,

63
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.600
because of the small groups of people,
they were much closer.

64
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.050
They knew everyone in the community,
it was intensely important.

65
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.110
And that there's a lot of people that think that some of the problems that we

66
00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:58.150
deal with today in society are because of this,

67
00:03:58.151 --> 00:04:00.160
this association that we have with our neighbors.

68
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.560
And we don't have a real sense of community.
I mean,

69
00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:06.100
I know like two or three of my neighbors and I see them once a year and I say,

70
00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:09.310
hi,
wave,
how's everything man?
Everything cool?
All right,
good seeing Ya.

71
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.460
But that's it.
You know,
there's no real community,
there's no interaction.

72
00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:13.270
There's no,

73
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.380
there's certainly no contribution as far as like working together together,

74
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.380
food or water or anything like that.
And I would imagine that these people were,

75
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:22.150
it just intensely close.
Yeah,

76
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.010
absolutely mean that must have been a big part of the attraction to you,
to them.

77
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.630
Like when they took you in and you were living with them and,
yeah,
absolutely.

78
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:33.190
I mean,
I think the average,

79
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.700
my booty pygmy village is only 85 250 on our 10 villages that we help and have

80
00:04:39.131 --> 00:04:43.780
the 3000 acres of land.
Um,
it's over 300,
uh,
for rich each village.

81
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.540
Um,
do you know about Dunbar's number?

82
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.550
Dunbar's number is a number that,
I mean it varies,
but the number,

83
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.530
somewhere around one 50 for most people,

84
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.920
there's a number of people that you can keep close relationships with.
Oh Wow.

85
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.680
They really only have room for 150 people in your head.

86
00:04:59.681 --> 00:05:02.380
You essentially of hard drive space.
Wow.
Yeah.

87
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.410
And that seems to be related to ancient tribal communities that people sense

88
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.650
that we developed that way,
that we develop these,

89
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.410
these small groups of 50 to 150 plus people.

90
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.850
And then when you get larger than that,
things get weird.
Yeah.
Well,
no,
that's,

91
00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:18.880
that's so true.
Like I,

92
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.800
whenever I went through the six year battle with oxy and just,

93
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.860
uh,
narcotics or pain pills,
like I,
um,
I dunno,

94
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.530
I would always be able to isolate super easy,
right?

95
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.050
Because when you're in your home,
you're completely alone.
Um,

96
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.300
and so it's different when you're in a village and with the pygmies,

97
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.100
you saw some of those huts,
how,
how small they are,
you know,
seriously.

98
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.840
In several of them.
Whenever I'm sleeping,

99
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.240
I have to sleep in the center and I have to have my feet out the door.
Um,

100
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.120
because it's so small.
Uh,
but it's,
um,

101
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.580
the only go in there when you're going to or if you're not feeling good and you

102
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:02.710
need some rest or if the sun's right over your head and in your hot.
Um,

103
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.650
but besides that,
you're cooking your kitchens outside.
Um,

104
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.240
that's where the people is.
That's where you do life is outside of your home.
Uh,

105
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.470
around the campfire.

106
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.580
We call it campfire university because that's where we've been taken to school

107
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.690
from the,
from the pygmies.
Uh,
they,

108
00:06:18.691 --> 00:06:21.920
it's where they teach us the most about life is around the campfire,

109
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:26.870
learning their culture,
learning about their kids,
learning about the hunts,

110
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.780
learning about how they make this,
make that,
um,

111
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.470
and it's where you get to do life together.
And so it's something really,

112
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:35.060
really cool.
Honestly,

113
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.060
I told them they want to know bill a little bit about my life.

114
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.710
And I told him that I went through drug addiction for six years and you know,

115
00:06:42.711 --> 00:06:45.530
they don't really struggle with that at all.
And,
uh,

116
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.150
and then I told them I got really depressed and I told him I really sad and I

117
00:06:50.151 --> 00:06:54.350
told him that I got so sad that I decided one time to take as many pills as I

118
00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:57.190
could and drink.
Uh,

119
00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.710
there's like half a bottle of Everclear or more,
um,

120
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.460
and snorted a bunch of coke and just wanted to end it all.
So,
I mean,

121
00:07:04.461 --> 00:07:08.590
I told him that I was suicidal and um,
I can't,

122
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.390
I won't ever forget how they,

123
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:17.090
how they looked at me almost dumbfounded in a way of like,
and then,

124
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.290
and then one of the questions the chief asked me said,
well,
wouldn't hurting you.

125
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.760
You're set.
Wouldn't hurting yourself,
only hurt you.
And,
uh,

126
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.400
so the whole concept of,

127
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.360
I guess what I'm getting to is they had never heard of anyone killing
themselves.

128
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.570
Like,
maybe they had heard stories or something like that,

129
00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:38.960
but they have never known anybody that actually killed themselves or heard of
it.

130
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.750
It's not something that they,
or their community,
their culture,

131
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.730
the pygmies kind of untouched out in the forest or even not a up in the cities.

132
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.860
Like that's just something that they don't struggle with.
They're,

133
00:07:48.861 --> 00:07:53.480
they're struggling so much day in and day out with struggles that are so deep

134
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:56.300
and they see their family and they do life together.

135
00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.390
That I think they just have so much more of.

136
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.210
W W we were just talking about it so much more of a support system.

137
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.990
People that were rally around them.
When you lose a family member,

138
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.070
everyone rallies around you.
Like whenever I go to the funerals,
it's the,

139
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.170
it's the worst thing in the world.

140
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.500
The sounds like people don't try to compose themselves.

141
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:20.870
They don't try to dress the body real nice and have flowers all around and now,

142
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:25.640
now losing loss of life is always tough,
always terrible.
Um,

143
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.870
but there's something we do here in our culture where we make it,
um,

144
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.060
try to make it as,

145
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.390
as nice or smooth or almost pretty as possible.
You know,

146
00:08:35.391 --> 00:08:39.110
the person's dressed really nice and it has the flowers and you compose yourself

147
00:08:39.111 --> 00:08:43.400
to come there.
You gather yourself,
you prepare the eulogy,
there's a,

148
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.070
there's a program.
When you step in there,

149
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.010
people get handed something and you know what's going to happen there.

150
00:08:49.011 --> 00:08:53.870
So you kind of can all compose,
man,
they are just so ugly.
It's so raw.

151
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.040
It's so real.

152
00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.000
And it's so like in your face and it just rips your heart open to where people

153
00:09:00.001 --> 00:09:02.370
are mourning.
I,
I saw Jayla,
um,

154
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.070
whenever Babo I was the one,

155
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.520
me and Ben were the ones that told [inaudible] he's the chief,
um,

156
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:12.720
about his grandson passing away.
We were there when it happened.
He wasn't around,

157
00:09:12.721 --> 00:09:15.630
he was out collecting or gathering.
Um,

158
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:20.460
and we met on the same path together and he saw it in our face that he knew Baba

159
00:09:20.461 --> 00:09:22.440
was sick,
but now he knew that he was gone.

160
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:28.040
And I remember Jay the wall just falling on his back into this,

161
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:32.720
off the side of the foot path into like this pile of brush,
like a,
like,

162
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:33.901
like probably two,

163
00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:38.220
three foot tall where he likes sunk into it and he was just squirming on his

164
00:09:38.221 --> 00:09:38.731
back,
you know,

165
00:09:38.731 --> 00:09:43.731
he's like in his sixties and he's watched so many of his grandchildren like pass

166
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.890
just because they don't have clean water and seeing them squirming,

167
00:09:46.891 --> 00:09:51.360
almost wanting to like crawl out of his skin,
you know?
Um,
and so,

168
00:09:51.361 --> 00:09:55.730
but I don't know.
I don't want to be a bummer.
I,
I'm,
I'm just,
uh,

169
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.290
I'll just express yourself.
It's,
it's,

170
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.430
but then how the whole community,
all hundred and 50,
200,

171
00:10:02.431 --> 00:10:06.330
300 people that were there,
uh,
all mourned together.

172
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:11.810
Like we shared it.
Like,
I,
I cried in a way that was like,
you know,
like,

173
00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.420
like,
like wiping my tears with everybody because everyone,

174
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:19.920
everyone was morning,
everyone was crying.
It wasn't just a few people.

175
00:10:19.921 --> 00:10:23.430
It wasn't just his mom and his dad,
his mom,
macho it.

176
00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:28.230
W it wasn't just [inaudible],
it was the whole village cried together.

177
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:33.120
And so I don't know,
but for me that,
that makes it seem like,

178
00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:35.610
I don't know if this,

179
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.700
I don't want to make too many connections between our culture because they're

180
00:10:38.701 --> 00:10:40.560
completely different or a lot different,

181
00:10:40.561 --> 00:10:45.270
but I think here of huge cause of divorce is the loss of a child.

182
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:46.703
Um,

183
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:51.480
but there it's almost unites the parents.

184
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:56.640
Um,
so much so whenever they lose a little one.
And I don't,

185
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.470
I don't mean to make this comparison,
but it's like,

186
00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.630
I think it's because when they mourn,

187
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:05.960
they truly go to the depths of the darkest place and they're able to truly

188
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:11.130
almost get it out,
if that makes sense.
Where when you're at the funeral,

189
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.780
you let yourself go.
You just let go and,

190
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:20.820
and,
and it's okay,
however ugly or however you handle it,
whatever emotions come,

191
00:11:20.821 --> 00:11:23.100
you just ride that wave,
if that makes sense.

192
00:11:23.101 --> 00:11:26.640
Do you think that because their life is so difficult,

193
00:11:26.641 --> 00:11:31.050
that life itself becomes more precious and the loss becomes more powerful or

194
00:11:31.051 --> 00:11:35.930
more intense?
More,
more raw?
Wow.
Yeah.
I needed you to,

195
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:40.680
to sum that up for sure.
Um,
yes,
I do.

196
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.650
I think whenever you struggle so much,
your,

197
00:11:43.651 --> 00:11:46.770
you become so much more appreciative and grateful of life,

198
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.050
of every breath you take.
Um,

199
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:54.430
that's gotta be connected to their lack of understanding suicide because our,

200
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:59.260
you know,
our idea of what a difficult life is,
it's difficult,

201
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:03.100
but there's food and shelter and this,
you know,

202
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.420
and really the easiest place to live in the world,
all those things connected.

203
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:13.650
Whereas with them just staying alive is such a struggle.

204
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.870
And getting water,
which is so easy for us all,
we,

205
00:12:16.871 --> 00:12:20.590
anybody can walk into any bathroom and any gas stop,
turn the water on.

206
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.410
Water comes out.
I mean,
everyone waters on hard to get in America.

207
00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.930
And even with the droughts,
it's easy to get water.

208
00:12:25.931 --> 00:12:29.650
We water fucking golf courses with millions of gallons of water every day.

209
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.940
Our understanding of what a struggle is is so different.

210
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.240
And I think whenever we,
when we've really struggle here,

211
00:12:37.241 --> 00:12:39.720
we can go hide away and we don't have to deal with it.

212
00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:44.560
You don't have to have conversations about it.
Um,
we can,

213
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:48.070
we can almost escape it.
We can escape it with our,
with our toys,

214
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.870
with our technology,
you know,
we can,

215
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:53.770
we can just bury your face in our phone or a computer or sit and watch a movie.

216
00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.470
And like,
whenever those uncomfortable feelings come up,

217
00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:01.030
we can try to ignore them or suppress them,

218
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:05.520
if that makes sense.
And they're there.
So it's almost,
man,

219
00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:09.220
this is going to be a weird,
strange curve ball or left turn.

220
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.720
But it's almost like a,

221
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:15.670
I've started floating recently and whenever I go in there,
um,
into the tank,

222
00:13:15.671 --> 00:13:19.480
it's like you have to,
you're,
you're left alone to your thoughts,
right?

223
00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:21.550
You don't have that technology.
You don't have this.

224
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:25.800
And so you can deal with stuff and you can try to focus and let go.
And,

225
00:13:25.801 --> 00:13:29.530
and for me,
it's been really beneficial.
And so I don't,

226
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.620
I know that sounds weird for me to make that connection,
but,
uh,

227
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:37.630
but whenever you're just left alone with your own thoughts,
you can go deep.

228
00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:42.160
And I feel like our culture here,
well,
okay,
if we compare,

229
00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.850
and I love our culture,
there's,
I'm not saying there's so much wrong with it,

230
00:13:45.851 --> 00:13:49.840
but uh,
but I feel like they're in relationships.

231
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:53.530
You go an inch or two wide and you go a mile deep in the Congo,

232
00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:58.480
you get to know people and then hear,
a lot of times you go a mile wide,

233
00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.360
but you go only,
you only scratched the surface.

234
00:14:01.361 --> 00:14:05.340
You don't go beneath the top soil that much.
Um,
so you do sometimes with,

235
00:14:05.341 --> 00:14:09.850
with a few people,
um,
there's only few people that we trust with that,
you know,

236
00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:14.440
but it's almost like they're,
everyone's so open to,
um,

237
00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:17.710
to go in deep with one another.
And because of that,

238
00:14:17.711 --> 00:14:21.250
you get to know each other better.
You get to a truly hurt when they hurt,

239
00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:26.200
you get to laugh.
When they laugh,
you get to cry when they cry.
Um,
and I may not,

240
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.520
I don't have to keep going on about it,
but please listen to,
don't apologize.

241
00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:31.990
There's a real,

242
00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:37.440
there's a real argument for the way that we live right now is not a way that we

243
00:14:37.441 --> 00:14:39.520
were designed for.
Meaning that,

244
00:14:39.521 --> 00:14:42.970
not that it can't be sustainable or manageable and you can't figure out a way to

245
00:14:42.971 --> 00:14:45.700
live a harmonious life in the modern context,

246
00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:50.890
but that a lot of people think that we're just,
we would naturally fit right in,

247
00:14:50.891 --> 00:14:53.330
in a tribal environment that it would feel natural.

248
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:56.780
And a lot of people experience that when they go camping for long stretches of

249
00:14:56.781 --> 00:15:00.080
time when they're out in the woods together,
you know,
for whatever reason.

250
00:15:00.081 --> 00:15:03.860
And they just decided to find a place and live off the land.
I mean,

251
00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:06.620
that's why I think a lot of those shows like those um,

252
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:11.680
subsistence living shows like,
um,
the homesteading.
Yeah,

253
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.090
that's very good.

254
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:17.130
It's a very attractive to people because I think there's a longing in our,

255
00:15:17.131 --> 00:15:21.890
our DNA eve and where it just,
there's a pole,

256
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.300
there's a pull to that man.

257
00:15:23.301 --> 00:15:26.610
I would love to just grow Kale and raise chickens and live off the farm.

258
00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:30.380
So a lot of people that feel like really,
really attracted to that.

259
00:15:30.381 --> 00:15:31.214
And I think it's,

260
00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:35.720
it's something deep in our being that we're longing for this connection to the

261
00:15:35.721 --> 00:15:39.710
real world and we've done an amazing thing creating cities.

262
00:15:39.711 --> 00:15:41.300
It's dependence.
It's some,

263
00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:46.280
it's almost beyond our comprehension because we're a part of it.
You know,

264
00:15:46.281 --> 00:15:49.460
we're a part of it.
It's normal.
You get on the subway,
you get in your car,

265
00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:51.770
you drive through the city seems normal.

266
00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:57.190
But it's so far removed from every single aspect of our history.

267
00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.230
I mean,
this is so new.
It's so recent.

268
00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:05.270
I think these people are just more in tune.

269
00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.480
It's horrible that they have to deal with these situations.

270
00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:13.020
The lack of water and toilets and the diseases and all the,
the,

271
00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:15.300
the other struggle.
But man,

272
00:16:15.301 --> 00:16:18.290
and there's a part of what they're doing and the way they're living that just

273
00:16:18.291 --> 00:16:22.580
seems like they're more in tune in a natural way.
Yeah.
Right.

274
00:16:22.581 --> 00:16:26.940
You would think that they would be more depressed.
Right.
And,
uh,

275
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:29.060
but,
but like,
you heard,

276
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:32.400
you heard Leo May's laugh in that when they asked him about the bananas and he

277
00:16:32.401 --> 00:16:33.740
just got tickled,
you know,
he couldn't,

278
00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.590
couldn't hold himself from just laughing and saying,
I can't count that much.

279
00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.330
Someone from Beverly Hills and say,
Hey,
this is what we got for a cause.

280
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:44.780
You can grow bananas now.
Like,
fuck you.
How do I get Outta here?
