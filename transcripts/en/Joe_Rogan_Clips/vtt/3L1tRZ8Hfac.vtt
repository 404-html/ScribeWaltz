WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.420
Fixed.

2
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.310
Mel Gibson's dad was 92 and he was in a wheelchair and now he's a hundred and

3
00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:09.750
he's walking around what the issue was.
Stem cells situation and and Americans,

4
00:00:09.751 --> 00:00:11.490
I don't hear too much the last time.

5
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.980
I'm not probably as knowledge as you are but wasn't,

6
00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:17.490
I'm Christopher Reeve trying to um,

7
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.570
promote stem more stem cell research.
I'm sure he was.
Yeah.

8
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:24.480
He had that spinal cord injury from the Horse for horse accident.

9
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.280
He was doing those horse jumps.
Yeah,
South Park thing.
Remember,

10
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.430
I don't remember by levels eating dead babies to like get the stem cells.

11
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.060
They 12 [inaudible] Alvin his we'll take a bad turn.

12
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.540
Yeah,
they're going to have a soda about rape on South Park.

13
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.890
They don't give a fuck.
They are the best.
It gives shelled out there.

14
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.520
There are also pushing the boundaries.

15
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.240
They're the ones out there that are promoting like ridiculous,

16
00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:54.300
preposterous comedy that's completely offensive but brilliant.

17
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.750
That's one of the things that when we were doing a Chappelle show,
the,

18
00:00:57.751 --> 00:01:02.010
one of the things I appreciate more than anything about this show was how it put

19
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.170
people are racist.

20
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.730
You backgrounds together to do the thing that we all should have in common and

21
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.400
that's the laugh and also to not push the button but touch on retro stuff

22
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.670
without having angry undertone and that's what's so fucked up about American

23
00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:24.960
now.
Whenever you talk about race,
it feels like one side,

24
00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:26.550
somebody has to be tense.

25
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.370
You know what I'm saying is never like a comfortable saves.
Never like,

26
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.720
and I know things are intense but we have to be able to laugh first.

27
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:34.800
Once you get people to laugh,

28
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.210
you can talk about whatever you want and then even if a person is not in

29
00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:43.050
agreement or have the same thoughts at the end of the day you should be at a

30
00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:44.040
respect that person.

31
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.380
And I think those same people should be able to share a laugh.

32
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.290
Yeah and there was a a fun,

33
00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:54.291
silly non aggressive quality to the way you guys put together sketches that got

34
00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:57.710
the point across in everybody laughed.
Everybody laughed at,

35
00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.020
I joke to this to this day when I travel and I do my audiences.

36
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.380
It's interesting because of course you would think I'm going to draw a certain

37
00:02:04.381 --> 00:02:08.340
audience because I'm black,
which I,
you know,
which I am and I do,
but it's weird.

38
00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:11.110
I could go to places and it's straight up like Dave,
column d,

39
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.040
The muddy boot motherfuckers,
you know what I'm saying?

40
00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:17.580
Like the money boot motherfuckers,
the money boost to jail,
they got John Deere.

41
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.400
Right.
You know what I'm saying?
They know all that elk shit you talking about,

42
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.140
you know,
do John Deere is know all this shit.

43
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.570
They probably call her right now and say,
no Joe,
I think you get that wrong.

44
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.080
You got to cut the heart from,
you know,
you've got to go left or right.

45
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.033
You know what I'm saying?

46
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.510
And I've noticed I have those people and that I have heard people,

47
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.390
but it just,
just when you can look out,
and this is what I showed it,

48
00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:43.040
when you can look at an audience and you say you have all of America there,

49
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.500
it was the best sketch comedy show in the history of television,
I think.

50
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.770
I think in living color is very,
very,
very overlooked.

51
00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:53.820
People forget how God damn raking and groundbreaking.

52
00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.420
It was bright in both of them.
Like it's wherever I go.
People always,

53
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.410
they always bring it up as a big point in my career,
but I was like as a,

54
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.830
I don't know if we have it every 10 years or 15 years,
it comes a time where,
uh,

55
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.060
the audience wants something different.
Sex Shit,
water down.

56
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.320
Same way when in limit colors saying we would def comedy jam came out,
you know,

57
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:17.620
you,
you didn't see a lot of uh,
a black standards on TV,

58
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.140
but they had this underground circuit.
It was bubbling,

59
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.060
that was bubbling and it was,

60
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.510
it was the right time when he pulled out the right time in living color comes

61
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:28.840
around,
it's the right time.
The Dave Chappelle show comes around.

62
00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:30.270
It's the right time to Richard partial.

63
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.110
Even though that only lasted three or four episode,

64
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.100
it was the right time and it caught on it the right time.
Yeah.
Um,

65
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.690
in terms of like groundbreaking sketch comedy shows though,

66
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:41.813
like that,
that,

67
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.630
that k k k bit where he had the blind tell you something.

68
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.930
Do you understand in the history of sketch,

69
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.350
nobody has premiered a sketch show and it came off so hardcore the first night

70
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.840
it's hot as hell.
She's hard as it comes.

71
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.980
When they ended that shit when we asked why,

72
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.220
why after all these years would you so,
so he was like,

73
00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:13.720
because she's a nigger lover.
I was like,

74
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.550
I was like,
that was one of them.
That was one of the joints.
I'm like,

75
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.530
wake up everybody no more sleeping in bed.
No.

76
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.620
From that moment that does show was going to be on the next level of shots.

77
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.200
Well was he was free.
It was,
it was so many when we did,
funny thing,

78
00:04:33.201 --> 00:04:38.110
a lot of things I used to do,
I was a warmup comedian for a Chappelle show.

79
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.350
So whenever you saw Chappelle show episode,

80
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.420
if you notice that whenever I came on screen and I'm not being cocky,

81
00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:48.850
people would go nuts.
They'd be like,
Oh shit.

82
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:52.540
And the reason was because I was a guy that wanted the ordinance before Dave

83
00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:53.680
came out.
Ah.

84
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.030
So I knew if I go gut the room out at the beginning,

85
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.000
people don't eat.
People don't even,
they didn't,
nobody knew I was there anything.

86
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.360
If I ripped that at the beginning and then when they see me on the screen it's

87
00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:05.194
going to be like,

88
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.210
it's going to be big horse and [inaudible] that show man.
It was just like,

89
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.230
it was just like a lot of things happen to show people like Rick James Sketch

90
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.310
the day we played that during the wrap arounds.
Man,
that should hit so hard.

91
00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:24.700
I was like,
this shit is fucking crazy.

92
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.530
Crazy funny thing people don't know is that comedy central did not like that

93
00:05:29.531 --> 00:05:33.850
sketch
comedy central.
Here's the,

94
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.570
this got,
it's funny.
Comedy Central,
they're like sketch and comedy central.

95
00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:39.940
Didn't think Charlie Murphy was funny in it

96
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.060
and I watched,

97
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.590
we ran as shit sick just to let you know the direction people think I wasn't

98
00:05:47.591 --> 00:05:52.360
shit six times and every time man,
every time you heard Dave say,

99
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.030
I'm Rick James Bitch,
it was gut son.

100
00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.270
It was gut side.
Yo,
what did the father figures say to the faced?

101
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.900
Where's,
where's Lantz?
You had a sketch was getting kids to spend it in school,

102
00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.930
right?
People was born school day teachers went the five fingers.

103
00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:13.130
I say Rick James Bitch.
All right Tom,
you suspended for a week.

104
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.750
You add Dave Chappelle,

105
00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:18.530
go to the fucking time out room is one of the most iconic sketches of all time.

106
00:06:18.531 --> 00:06:20.090
How wrong was comedy central?

107
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.620
I mean not just a little wrong lot along the way.
Wrong all the way wrong.

108
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.380
Like almost like suicidal.
It was like hmm.

109
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.750
But then it goes to show him like it goes to show,

110
00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:32.570
you know how you have a vision was something you see it.

111
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:33.950
Everybody may not see it.

112
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.690
Well that's the problem with working with executives to right.

113
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.570
It's like their vision is different than your vision.

114
00:06:38.571 --> 00:06:41.510
They would like to ship shape you in a certain way and you know,

115
00:06:41.511 --> 00:06:45.740
and I know Dave ran into problems with them wanting him to change language so

116
00:06:45.741 --> 00:06:48.560
they could get more sponsors.
Yeah.
I think,

117
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:54.260
I think that that wasn't an issue.
And to be quite honest,

118
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.400
I don't know exactly what happened.
Everything is speculation.

119
00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:59.280
He never talked to him about,

120
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.390
never talked to him about it because the reason why I never talked to him about

121
00:07:02.391 --> 00:07:05.640
it because I didn't need to talk to them about it.
You know what I'm saying?
Um,

122
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.350
that show was great for me.
It was a great Frey platform for me.

123
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.560
And then out it was more important,

124
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:17.830
my friendship and how he felt away from that was more important then.

125
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:23.190
So why'd you leave?
Where'd you go?
First Time I saw him or like as long as you,

126
00:07:23.191 --> 00:07:25.940
okay.
Cause this is gonna be scary for anybody.
One of your closest friends,

127
00:07:25.941 --> 00:07:28.460
somebody you work with all of a sudden just goes to another country.

128
00:07:28.461 --> 00:07:31.580
You don't hear from him,
you know?
But when I first saw him after that,

129
00:07:31.581 --> 00:07:35.030
like I was excited and I would just like,
you know,

130
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:39.980
with whatever it was,
we had a moment we may history and people go on,

131
00:07:39.981 --> 00:07:42.290
people go on to do other things and just keep it moving.
Well,

132
00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:45.890
that show was really,
people always say Daniel,

133
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.050
if it wasn't for the Chapelle show,
this and that.
[inaudible]

134
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:54.230
gave me a platform for people to see what I've been doing for years.

135
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.920
And you know,
you see talents in the club now you see a muffin is good shit,

136
00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:00.840
good shit.
But when they get the right platform for the world scene,

137
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.500
you know what I'm saying?
And that's kind of separate.
Um,

138
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:08.210
you see one person go from one level to the next level who has the right

139
00:08:08.211 --> 00:08:11.210
platform to showcase their talent and that should show did that for me.

140
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:12.920
And with that said,

141
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:18.020
I gave that show everything every time I had a second on camera.
Every time.

142
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.960
Like if you look at two and a half years on this show,

143
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.500
if you had an editor breakdown how many times I spoke,

144
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.540
it would probably be a total of four minutes.
I'll get a word here,

145
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:31.160
I get a phrase here,

146
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:35.390
but I told myself whenever they turn that motherfucking camera,
I'm going for it.

147
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:37.130
Like,
even if I'm not talking,

148
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:42.790
I'm going to make my body so expressive that your eyeball draws too with no,

149
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.040
I remember Neal told me one time,
he said,
because I always,

150
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:49.490
I always get a mic cause I'll come up with a line or something to throw in.

151
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:53.650
And we were doing a Rick James Sketch and I didn't have a mic.
I was like,
Yo,
uh,

152
00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:57.350
sound.
And Neil said you're not going to get a mic bro.
I said,

153
00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:02.300
am I my I was like,
I might say something like,

154
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.910
you're not going to say anything.
I was like fuck.
So I told myself,

155
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.480
well he smacks this motherfucker cause if you look at their same,

156
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:14.370
when he smacks me,
I say what the f?
I was like,
um,
like uh,
uh,
uh,

157
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:18.000
watch the square park mime.
I pushed that.

158
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.530
I said what thought fuck I made my face.

159
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.640
He didn't give me a mic,
but I said what the fuck with my face.

160
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:32.120
And I always as people always as a matter of showing as young actors and stuff

161
00:09:32.311 --> 00:09:36.150
like that,
can you talk to me?
What do you need to,
I was like with anything,

162
00:09:36.151 --> 00:09:39.780
the best thing to do is figure out a way to get on a set.

163
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:45.420
You get on a set,
you,
you do background,
you learn,
you get opportunities.

164
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.020
You got to be around it.
You've got to get a skill set,

165
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.690
but when it's time to show up,
you gotta show up.

166
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.760
You have to show up.
Motherfuckers talk a lot of shit.

167
00:09:55.761 --> 00:09:56.401
I want to do this out there.

168
00:09:56.401 --> 00:09:59.370
And then when they say action of them saying ready to show up.
