Hello Freak bitches.
Maybe they,
they,

2
00:00:04.131 --> 00:00:06.360
the story has been clarified while we've been talking,

3
00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:11.361
but this is now seems that Susan Rice came out at one point.

4
00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:16.680
She said she knew nothing about the unmasking of,
of Trump associates in,

5
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.080
in,
um,
the this reason surveillance case.

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.470
And now it seems that she is claiming that she actually asked to have certain

7
00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:29.130
names unmasked and,
and so like this,
this has been seized upon again,

8
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.700
just in the last few hours as exam.

9
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.230
An example of a lie,
right?
Which seems very sinister,

10
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.540
um,
at,
but as though it equalizes the two sides here,
right?
Let's low.

11
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:43.650
So let's say worst case scenario,

12
00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:48.600
Susan Rice lied about having some knowledge of this investigation.
Um,

13
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.340
that doesn't,
it says something bad about Susan Rice.
It says something.
I mean,

14
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.380
she has to deal with the consequences of that lie,

15
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.640
but it doesn't exonerate all of the line that Trump has done about everything

16
00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:04.530
under the sun.
Right?
So what so destabilizing here is at the moment,

17
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.330
the moment,
and this is even true of honest errors,

18
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.340
the moment that a news organization like yours or the New York Times commits an

19
00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:18.651
honest error that gets pointed to from those who want to treat the mainstream

20
00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:23.530
news media as just fake news as see everything's the same.
Like,
like,
like right.

21
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:24.290
Like they're,

22
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.890
you're no better than than somebody who's just manufacturing fake news on a

23
00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:33.450
laptop in his basement.
Um,
so it's like,

24
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.560
it's,
and the flip side of that is when Alex Jones get something right,

25
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.970
it seems to,
it seems to make him look like a,

26
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.240
a dignified journalistic enterprise analogous to the New York Times or to ABC

27
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.890
News.
And neither of those things are true.
I mean,

28
00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:52.530
there are small lies and then there are huge lives.

29
00:01:52.531 --> 00:01:57.531
There are honest mistakes but be committed by totally reputable organizations

30
00:01:58.381 --> 00:02:02.010
that are really trying to get the facts straight.
And then there are malicious,

31
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.030
it's just militia,

32
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.660
malicious propaganda outlets that are not at all trying to get their facts

33
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:06.891
straight.

34
00:02:06.891 --> 00:02:11.850
And I'm trying to engineer everyone's credulity and ignorance into something

35
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.940
that is just purely a matter of,
of,
uh,
you know,

36
00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:18.600
tribal sentiment,
you know,
and,
um,

37
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.740
so we lose our ability to distinguish these different projects when we say,

38
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.970
oh look,
you know,
fake news.
It both sides do it.

39
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.530
Or here's a lie.

40
00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:32.430
Here's Susan Rice's one lie that she told them the last 10 years maybe and got

41
00:02:32.431 --> 00:02:36.800
caught for,
and we have a president who lies every time he picks up his,
you know,

42
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.180
it approaches a Mike or picks up his Twitter.

43
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.190
She had other problems because she had gone on,

44
00:02:41.191 --> 00:02:46.191
I believe on the Sunday morning talk shows after Bengazi was talking points.

45
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.000
Yes.
Yeah.
No,
Susan,
Susan look like she was itching to get caught.
I mean,

46
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:55.350
whether this is a case of,
yeah.
Uh,
no,
I,

47
00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:59.800
I think your point is very,
very important because I think that you have,

48
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.160
um,
if you have one side that lies all the time,

49
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.030
it's imperative that the other side don't lie at all.
Yeah,
yeah.
Oh.

50
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:09.220
And the line and say,
look,
everybody does it.

51
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.170
<v 1>It's a tense time for people.</v>

52
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:16.171
In my line of work because we were so much scrutiny and then we get it wrong.

53
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:22.320
We really,
you know,
we take a lot of heat,
but when we get it wrong,
I,

54
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.290
I think we're pretty quick to say we got it wrong.
Here's the actual,

55
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.960
here's the truth.

56
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.750
<v 0>Do you know the Donald Trump Jr said that Cernovich get a Pulitzer.</v>

57
00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.400
You're exposing Susan Rice.
Really?
Yeah.
All right.
Yeah,
a bit.
But that's it.

58
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.360
That's why,

59
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.440
that's why this drives me a little crazy because it is not Cernovich is the fact

60
00:03:39.441 --> 00:03:42.590
that,
that this is,
this is [inaudible] to the real world.

61
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.320
<v 1>Where'd you lead them down?
The Cernovich thing.
You just can't even read them.</v>

62
00:03:45.321 --> 00:03:45.960
Right.

63
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.190
<v 0>It's,
it's mean a huge lord in front of the kitten.</v>

64
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.130
We're only now discovering the consequences of this.

65
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.830
Let's come back in five years if we're talking about anything that makes any

66
00:03:58.831 --> 00:03:59.664
sense.

67
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.070
<v 2>Okay.</v>
