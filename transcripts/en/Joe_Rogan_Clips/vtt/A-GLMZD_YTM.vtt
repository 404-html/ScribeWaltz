1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.710
Brain trauma from that fight.
There is a,

2
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.730
I don't want to say there's a rash of suicides in the seal teams specifically.

3
00:00:10.451 --> 00:00:13.690
Obviously the number 22 is thrown out a lot when it comes to veterans suicides.

4
00:00:13.691 --> 00:00:15.820
But that's what does a 22%,

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.500
22 veterans a day a convinced he said is the number that is often touted.

6
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.480
I,
I'm hesitant to say that number is accurate because if you look at how it was

7
00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:29.440
derived,
it wasn't,
they could have done a better job of getting that number.

8
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.220
And I,

9
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.420
and I don't want to say inside of the seal teams if there's a suicide issue,

10
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.070
even though I do know a few people that have committed suicide and they were the

11
00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:43.750
ones that I would least expect it from,
but they were also the ones who had,
uh,

12
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.050
quite a bit of a high operational tempo.

13
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.980
And the one thing that I don't think,
especially in the military medicine world,

14
00:00:50.981 --> 00:00:54.520
they understand well as traumatic brain injury and the impact it has long term

15
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.760
and how easy it can be.
Because you know this,
uh,

16
00:00:57.761 --> 00:00:58.840
I've heard you talk about it before,

17
00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:00.900
you don't have to get knocked out to get a brain injury.
Right.

18
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.390
And I know countless times where I either did something dumb or was just

19
00:01:06.521 --> 00:01:10.450
standing in the wrong place or had a hard parachute opening and I cracked my

20
00:01:10.451 --> 00:01:13.860
head against the metal risers and your head hurts for the rest of the day.
Yeah.

21
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.400
And it's,

22
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.110
I've seen the change in behavior in some people and I,

23
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.200
I know the stuff that's tied to it as well,
the low hormones,

24
00:01:23.201 --> 00:01:27.850
all of that stuff there that is happening I think at the highest levels in the

25
00:01:27.851 --> 00:01:29.230
military,
probably military wide,

26
00:01:29.231 --> 00:01:33.040
but specifically those people who were kind of more on the front leading edge of

27
00:01:33.041 --> 00:01:36.460
combat operations.
And I think as a country we're in a word,

28
00:01:36.461 --> 00:01:41.020
a total unknown area because we're in a sustained period of war longer we've

29
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.440
ever been as a nation and nobody knows the outcome of that.

30
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.040
And people who I would've never guessed would make the decision to take their

31
00:01:50.411 --> 00:01:53.260
own life.
I'll get a text and hey,
you know,

32
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.290
so and so just went out into the woods and no other external injury,

33
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.790
no other marker.

34
00:02:00.791 --> 00:02:04.660
Then obviously something happened in the geometry between their ears that caused

35
00:02:04.661 --> 00:02:05.650
them to make that decision.

36
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.310
And I suspect it's from the repeated exposure to the brain injury.

37
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.320
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

38
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.460
It's something that people are just starting to understand over the last couple

39
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.410
of decades.
I mean obviously a,

40
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.660
there was a focus that concussion movie and you know,

41
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:23.290
I don't know if you saw that Bob Costas was actually pulled from football.
Uh,

42
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.820
and they,
they had told him that he'd crossed the line,
the announcer,

43
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.110
they pulled him,
they pulled him from doing,
uh,
what,
what event was it?

44
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.390
Was it from the Superbowl because,
uh,

45
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.310
he was talking about traumatic brain injury and the realities of it and they

46
00:02:38.311 --> 00:02:41.520
said,
you crossed the line.
He's like,
I crossed the line by talking about reality,

47
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.240
honest and open person.
That's not cool.
I mean,
that's what he does.
I mean,

48
00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:49.560
that is Bob Costas,
his entire hook.
But I mean,
he's,
he's a brilliant guy.

49
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.210
But this,
uh,

50
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.290
this problem was so poorly understood just two decades ago.

51
00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:59.470
So everyone's just sort of coming to this realization that,
I mean,

52
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.840
according to Dr. Mark Gordon,
who have,

53
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.280
I've had on who works with the Warrior Angel Foundation,
Andrew Mars,
uh,

54
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.420
set up where they're helping all these veterans that have traumatic brain

55
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:13.570
injuries.
And I've,
I've had Mr. Gordon on several times.

56
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.320
He says that you can get traumatic brain injuries from things that don't even

57
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:19.060
remotely knock you out.
He was like,

58
00:03:19.061 --> 00:03:22.630
people get them from doing moguls when they ski.
They get them from,

59
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.950
from your brain,
just Rad and get them from jet skis bouncing around on jet skis.

60
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:29.560
I mean,
you can get it from a minor car accident.

61
00:03:29.561 --> 00:03:31.030
You can have a traumatic brain injury.

62
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.240
And for guys like me that got hit in the head for years,

63
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.120
who knows what the fuck is going on in there.
You know?

64
00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:39.700
And for professional fighters,
it's,
you know,

65
00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:43.980
it's almost inevitable for football players.
It's even worse,
you know,

66
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.040
for football players,

67
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.060
they did some crazy study and I know we quoted it and I don't remember what the

68
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:50.590
numbers was,
but at some insane number,

69
00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:55.390
like in the high 80% of people from high school on through college and into the

70
00:03:55.391 --> 00:04:00.391
professionals have Tbi or CTE or the some signs of a traumatic brain injury.

71
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.950
<v 0>I'd be surprised if they didn't give them.
They're fucking crazy.
It gets,</v>

72
00:04:06.951 --> 00:04:10.610
it is interesting too,
like I was saying,
so when I got medically retired,

73
00:04:10.611 --> 00:04:13.010
they sent me to a medical facility called Nikko,

74
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.700
which is attached to Walter Reed and as the best care that I ever received

75
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.280
because it's a civilian facility.

76
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.710
It's called the national intrepid center of excellence.

77
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.930
<v 1>We did a lot of work with them back in the day for the UFC.</v>

78
00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:28.020
The UFC raised a bunch of money for that.
Really?
Yeah.

79
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.841
<v 0>Well,</v>

80
00:04:28.841 --> 00:04:32.710
the money was well spent because I went there and I probably would not have been

81
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:37.711
medically retired had I not because I left with literally 150 page dossier and,

82
00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:42.160
but it's interesting tying it back to Tbi because I spent a lot of time as a

83
00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:47.161
requirement talking to psychologists and psychiatrists and it the Tbi pts in the

84
00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:50.891
military.

85
00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:54.220
It gets interesting because it seems like they're treated as different issues.

86
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.870
And I'm probably misquoting the number a little bit.

87
00:04:55.871 --> 00:04:58.360
I think there's 13 recognize symptoms of both,

88
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.490
but there's an overlay of like 11 so,
uh,

89
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.400
I can't remember any of these symptoms off the top of my head,

90
00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:10.300
but you could describe one and it could apply both to Tbi and post traumatic

91
00:05:10.301 --> 00:05:11.134
stress.

92
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.500
So it gets even more muddled on how are you treating somebody for a brain injury

93
00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:19.090
or are you treating somebody for a post traumatic stress?

94
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:20.980
Are you lumping everybody together?

95
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:25.180
It's just cause I see a lot of people and specifically a lot of veterans getting

96
00:05:25.181 --> 00:05:28.900
stuck in that world where they've,
it's a lot of focus on pts,

97
00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:33.901
but the reality is it could just be from the trauma received over a career or

98
00:05:34.181 --> 00:05:37.390
you know,
nearly two decades for most people to make it to retirement.
It's

99
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.650
<v 1>Intel.
Well apparently blasts are a big one,
right?</v>

100
00:05:40.651 --> 00:05:42.510
Like blown down doors and things like that.

101
00:05:42.511 --> 00:05:46.260
Even even you just step away and you brace yourself.

102
00:05:46.261 --> 00:05:49.440
The impact of just the air,
the concussive force of it,

103
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.540
this is devastating for your brain.

104
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.500
The human brain apparently is just so much more delicate and sensitive than

105
00:05:55.501 --> 00:05:58.160
anyone could have ever guessed will.
And concussive blasts

106
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.360
<v 0>are tough phone because they travel.</v>

107
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.650
So if you're internally in a building and you find a door that's at the end of a

108
00:06:03.651 --> 00:06:04.340
hallway,

109
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.340
even if you go all the way down to the end of the hallway and around the corner

110
00:06:07.341 --> 00:06:10.370
of the blast can still get you,
cause it will come down off the door,

111
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.840
reflect off of the hallway and still rocky you,
Jesus.
Yeah,
it's,
it's,

112
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.840
I thought I had a good hiding spot more than once.
Did not have a good,

113
00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:24.690
had you sit in and just be like,
oh that hurt.
Oh,

114
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.390
more than one occasion.

115
00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:29.350
Or you're working with a bunch of assholes who take all the good hiding spots.

116
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:34.340
I kind of DM it has turned around and just ball up and there's not really much

117
00:06:34.341 --> 00:06:38.780
you can do about that.
Right?
I mean if you have to blow down that door,

118
00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:42.140
someone has to be there to detonate and you have to be close enough for it to

119
00:06:42.141 --> 00:06:45.320
activate.
Right.
Uh,
how are they doing it wirelessly?

120
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.190
They might be doing it wirelessly.
Now when I was in,
uh,
it was called known l,
um,

121
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.310
and it basically,
it's a or a shock tube.

122
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.930
So you put a charge wherever adult,
uh,
a gate,

123
00:06:56.931 --> 00:07:01.640
a door and you basically have to attach an initiator to it cause the charge

124
00:07:01.641 --> 00:07:02.900
isn't going to go off by itself.

125
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.470
So you need a highly reactive charge to set off an explosive that has less

126
00:07:06.471 --> 00:07:10.710
reactive.
You keep them separate,
obviously for safety,
except for the main breach.

127
00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.490
He probably has at least one hooked up so he can be really fast.

128
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.770
But then you just extend that flash tube and it's,
they come in long reels.

129
00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:22.400
I mean that you can get 30,
40,
50 feet and each charge,

130
00:07:22.401 --> 00:07:26.750
mathematically we do math on it to determine the minimum safe distance of every

131
00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:29.510
charge.
And it's written on the charge.
So you know how far you can get away.

132
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:34.260
But sometimes you're in a situation where,
like I said,

133
00:07:34.261 --> 00:07:38.300
that you think you got an awesome hiding spot and the guy lays out the flash

134
00:07:38.301 --> 00:07:42.470
tube and he's getting ready to fire it off and you realize that you're staring

135
00:07:42.471 --> 00:07:45.850
directly at the charge and you have nowhere to hide and they're not going to

136
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.680
wait on you.
So it's turn around,
cover up into a ball and eat it.
Oh,

137
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:55.370
this is there a best way to eat it?
A open your mouth and cover your ears.

138
00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:59.950
I'm Aly.
Yeah,
open your mouth yet.
Allow instance instead of overloading,
uh,

139
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:01.700
like your sinus cavities and your,
uh,

140
00:08:01.701 --> 00:08:03.830
your ear canal so we can cover ears and open your mouth.

141
00:08:03.831 --> 00:08:06.320
It helps if something's going to go off really close to you.

142
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.600
Open your mouth and cover your ears.
Yup.
What,
what,

143
00:08:10.601 --> 00:08:13.490
what's the difference between opening and closing the mouth?
Uh,

144
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.930
the effect of the wave.

145
00:08:14.931 --> 00:08:18.350
Am I understanding that contain pressure inside of your body as opposed to

146
00:08:18.351 --> 00:08:21.860
giving it a,
an avenue to escape Jesus Christ?

147
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.430
One of the things they're realizing apparently about concussions is that even

148
00:08:25.431 --> 00:08:29.750
just getting hit in the chest can give you concussion from the tip of the head.

149
00:08:29.751 --> 00:08:32.060
Cause you're,
you know,
you get hit in the chest and you're like,

150
00:08:32.061 --> 00:08:33.140
I didn't even get hit in the head,

151
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.360
but just getting hit in the chest makes your head snap and it makes your brain

152
00:08:37.361 --> 00:08:40.490
swish around inside your head.
And that's what gives you an injury.

153
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:45.230
I just remember earlier on,
I mean like in the mid two thousands it wasn't,

154
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.240
the only question was does your head hurt?

155
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.940
Like that was the beginning of whether or not you might have sustained a

156
00:08:49.941 --> 00:08:53.510
concussion.
And then obviously learning much more now and where we're at.

157
00:08:53.511 --> 00:08:57.390
It's like,
yeah,
you may have even had any sensation in your head,

158
00:08:57.391 --> 00:08:58.980
but you know,

159
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.740
it's kind of crazy when you think about how long people have been studying the

160
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:02.371
human body,

161
00:09:02.371 --> 00:09:05.850
and then this is just something they've really got to a real understanding of in

162
00:09:05.851 --> 00:09:07.020
the last couple of decades.

163
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.900
I don't even know if I would characterize it as a real understanding.

164
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:13.170
I think they're farther along than they were to two decades ago,

165
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.820
but I think the amount we know versus the amount that we don't know is much more

166
00:09:17.821 --> 00:09:18.990
weighted on the amount.
We don't know.
