1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.070
It's kind of a,
uh,
mediocrity.

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.690
You really need to fail to fall out of the limelight long enough to produce

3
00:00:07.691 --> 00:00:09.070
something really strong.
Again.

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.690
<v 1>Totally makes sense.</v>

5
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.750
One of the best things that can happen to a comedian is bombing.

6
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.800
When you bomb that feeling is so bad.

7
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.430
I was describing as like sucking a thousand Dick's in front of your mother.

8
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.630
But the problem is the differences that there's probably someone out there who

9
00:00:26.631 --> 00:00:28.790
would enjoy sucking a thousand Dick's in front of their mother,

10
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.500
but nobody enjoys bombing.
So it's probably worse than that.
But that feeling,

11
00:00:33.501 --> 00:00:34.400
whatever it is,

12
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.940
reignites your appreciation for people's attention span your appreciation for

13
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.350
tightening up your delivery,
your concepts,

14
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.330
figuring out a better way to get them through.

15
00:00:47.331 --> 00:00:48.710
You never want to experience that again.

16
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.250
And some of the greatest moments in my own personal journey of standup have come

17
00:00:54.711 --> 00:00:58.580
from eating shit.
That's where they come from.
You got each,

18
00:00:58.581 --> 00:01:02.780
I mean it's great to do well,
wonderful feels great,
but those eating shit ones,

19
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.480
those are the ones that get you to the notebook.
Again,

20
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.760
those are the ones that reinvigorate you.

21
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.930
Have you spending hours and hours in your hotel room going over sheets of paper

22
00:01:11.931 --> 00:01:15.830
and checking out idea and making sure these concepts connect together in some

23
00:01:15.831 --> 00:01:19.370
sort of a meaningful way and figuring out what tightened things,
cut out the fat.

24
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.170
When you're in this situation right now and you're frantically writing now and,

25
00:01:24.171 --> 00:01:28.250
and,
and you know,
and sort of forced into this,
uh,

26
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.300
element of creativity,
this like,
you're,
you're forced to be hungry again.

27
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.230
I mean,
I wouldn't wish it on you,
but in a way,

28
00:01:36.231 --> 00:01:37.640
do you feel like it's kind of a gift?

29
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.000
<v 0>Oh yeah.
Yeah.
You in a way,</v>

30
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:45.001
you have to accept ultimately that everything is a gift because it's always

31
00:01:45.611 --> 00:01:50.350
about what they call a cognitive reframing,
cognitive reframing,

32
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.610
whatever happens,

33
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.470
you reframe it in such a way that you recognize the value of it.
Um,

34
00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.790
and so yeah,
regardless of what happens,
you know,

35
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.110
before my father got murdered,

36
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.590
he had been asking me for an introduction to a known a writer in 1998 and I kept

37
00:02:09.071 --> 00:02:12.060
on thinking,
I am not going to introduce my father to whatnot,

38
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.070
a writer because I know he's going to hit on her.

39
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.930
<v 1>Okay.</v>

40
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.150
<v 0>And I wouldn't just going to be mortified to have my dad hitting on,</v>

41
00:02:20.151 --> 00:02:23.320
went on a rider and he'd always talk about how pretty she was.

42
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.270
Any chance I can meet her and,
and,
and to tell the truth,

43
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.900
when I got the word that my father had been murdered by white supremacist in the

44
00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:33.340
mountains of Idaho,

45
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.370
one of my first thoughts was I'm off the hook without Wynona rider thing.

46
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.420
<v 2>Okay.</v>

47
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.180
<v 0>And that's cognitive reframing.</v>

48
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.390
And you had to do it all the time.

49
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.070
<v 1>Glass half full right there.</v>

50
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.600
<v 0>How long my father,
but you know,
nobody,
none,</v>

51
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.290
none of our relationships are completely perfect all the time.

52
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.750
<v 1>Right.
It's no way around it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well that's again,</v>

53
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.610
the great thing about

54
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.400
unchained writing is that you can express those ideas and that would,

55
00:03:14.401 --> 00:03:18.120
that would be my,
my main concern about any sort of,
uh,

56
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.300
a workshop or support group or any,
any,
any,

57
00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:25.950
any sort of group of like minded peers that wouldn't understand that and that

58
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.290
would want you to limit your language.
I just don't,

59
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.380
it does,
doesn't compute.

60
00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.630
<v 0>Yeah.
And in the platonic world,
yeah,
everybody should kind of get it.</v>

61
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.140
But unless you're ruffling feathers,
even within workshop,

62
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.180
you're not going far enough.
You know,
I loved riding that line and Fight Club,

63
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.990
uh,
where Tyler and Marla have sex for the first time.

64
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.380
And then the most romantic thing that,
that Marla can say is,

65
00:03:54.381 --> 00:03:57.350
I want to have your baby.
So what is the inverse?

66
00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.350
So of course Marla turns to him and she says,

67
00:04:00.351 --> 00:04:03.230
I hope I got pregnant because I really want to have your abortion.

68
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.200
And that's the line that the movie studio went around and around.

69
00:04:09.201 --> 00:04:12.410
And even Brad Pitt's head,
do you know,
my mom's going to see this movie.

70
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.500
I don't want her to see this line.

71
00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.360
And they shot that scene was so many different substitute lions.

72
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.380
And then finally Fincher wrote the line and Helena Bonham Carter says,

73
00:04:24.381 --> 00:04:26.780
I haven't been fuck like that since grade school.

74
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.670
And at that point 20th century Fox said,
can we switch it back to the abortion?

75
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.393
And so

76
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.840
unless you're always kind of pushing to kind of,

77
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.230
you know,
until you get some push back,

78
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.030
you don't feel like you're pushing hard enough.

79
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.260
And so push back is not a bad thing.
It's just kind of a,

80
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.050
it's proof that you're doing your job.
Does it do

81
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.170
<v 1>trend?
It's happening now though,
this,
this,
that,</v>

82
00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.350
this pushback is coming far quicker than it ever has before.

83
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.140
Is that there's a trend now to,

84
00:05:03.141 --> 00:05:08.141
to limit language and limit creativity and limit the subject matter,

85
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.020
trigger warnings and stop people from,
you know,

86
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.380
it stopped people from experiencing things that might be disturbing.

87
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.900
<v 0>And I could see both sides of that because on one hand we've got a generation</v>

88
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.940
that has been exposed to so much sensationalistic stuff in order to attain their

89
00:05:27.941 --> 00:05:28.774
attention.

90
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.620
They've really been overloaded with the most extreme versions of everything.
Uh,

91
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.880
in order to get there,
their ticket money or whatever.

92
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.240
Dave really been pounded by so much stimuli.

93
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.020
I could see them kind of really pulling back and wanting to be monastic for the

94
00:05:44.021 --> 00:05:47.260
rest of their lives.
And on the other hand,

95
00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:49.240
I see them as being a

96
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.090
<v 3>okay</v>

97
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:56.070
<v 0>as wanting to sort of counter dominate in order to just create room enough in</v>

98
00:05:56.071 --> 00:05:58.460
the world for their statement.

99
00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:59.710
<v 1>You know,
they're,</v>

100
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.710
they're moving into a world that's already so occupied by attention getters that

101
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.140
if they can shut some down,
that there might be room for their own expression.

102
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.860
So I kind of see benefit on both sides and in a way to there they're dominating

103
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:18.630
their teachers,
which is good because it,

104
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.370
it's a way of exploring your own power and,

105
00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:26.570
and figuring out what you can do in the world and that you can have a effect.

106
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.950
You can have agency.
So I don't think it's a totally bad thing.

107
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.200
That's interesting.
The,
the,

108
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:38.240
the idea that them dominating their teachers is in some way good.
Having the,

109
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:39.020
well,

110
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:44.020
it certainly gives you confidence and lets you understand that you can affect

111
00:06:45.261 --> 00:06:48.590
change even if it's meaningless change.
No.

112
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.000
Did you pay attention to what happened at Evergreen state in,
in uh,
Washington?

113
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.300
Yeah.
Did you see when there's a,
for people don't know the story.
It's a,

114
00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.320
the Bret Weinstein story where the students decided that there was going to be a

115
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.463
day of absence.

116
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.340
Traditionally it had been where people of color stayed home just so that people

117
00:07:07.341 --> 00:07:11.420
could recognize the important part that they play in the culture in society.

118
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.780
But then they had ramped it up and decided white people are going to have to

119
00:07:14.781 --> 00:07:17.420
stay home now.
And he was like,
that's racist.

120
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.230
And the whole thing went crazy and went haywire and the,

121
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.600
the schools basically falling apart.
Um,

122
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:28.660
but there was a scene that was filmed where the president of the university was

123
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.300
in,
uh,

124
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.470
president of college was in this auditorium and he was addressing these children

125
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.890
and uh,

126
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.410
they told him to stop moving his hands because it was threatening.

127
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.590
And so he put his hands down,

128
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.640
he put them behind his back and they all started laughing.

129
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.160
And I was like,
wow,
this dumb fuck like this,
this,

130
00:07:52.161 --> 00:07:54.080
this guy's running this university.

131
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:58.100
And he let them tell him not to move his hands.

132
00:07:58.101 --> 00:08:00.410
Gesturing is you speaking.
And he's like,
what are the ones,

133
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.950
one of the most nonthreatening Beta people on the planet?

134
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.800
And this guy's just giving.

135
00:08:05.801 --> 00:08:09.530
He just wants to keep his job and try to silence this mob,

136
00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:13.790
this angry horde of,
you know,
fucking kids.
They're kids.

137
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:19.100
But when he listens and puts his hands down,
I probably watched it 10 times.

138
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:22.160
They all start laughing,
you know,
and just,

139
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:27.140
I think it just demonstrates how desperately they want a stronger leader.

140
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.000
They don't want,
they don't respect their,

141
00:08:30.001 --> 00:08:35.001
didn't want to learn from somebody who is a college professor and has never

142
00:08:35.091 --> 00:08:36.890
really attained anything in the world.

143
00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:41.360
They just don't want to become another cog in that same kind of,
you know,
we'll,

144
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:46.870
they want to learn from somebody the respect and whose attainments months,

145
00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.650
the day respect,
whose achievements they respect.
Right.

146
00:08:50.651 --> 00:08:52.880
That's probably part of the issue of universities,
right,

147
00:08:52.881 --> 00:08:56.490
is that these professors are so terrified of the reactions of the students,

148
00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.700
which is not the place you're supposed to be with a mentor student relationship.

149
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:06.960
It's not supposed to be that way.
It's not supposed to be.

150
00:09:06.961 --> 00:09:10.530
The mentor desperately needs the student in how you see that sometimes in

151
00:09:10.531 --> 00:09:14.340
private schools with rich kids that they treat their teachers like shit and the

152
00:09:14.341 --> 00:09:19.170
teachers have to bite their tongue and as they,
they have to in all this is not,

153
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:20.923
it's not,
not,

154
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.950
it's not the normal dynamic that exists with the older wise person and the young

155
00:09:25.951 --> 00:09:27.850
person who's trying to learn from this person.

156
00:09:27.851 --> 00:09:30.150
They deeply respects not that dynamic at all.

157
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:35.450
It's this old person who's weak and wants to keep their job and is willing to

158
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:40.940
tailor their own thoughts and ideas to this irrational mob of social justice

159
00:09:42.931 --> 00:09:46.110
warriors.
And that's what we're seeing on campuses now.
You know,

160
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:51.270
professors calling for censorship and,
and,
and uh,

161
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.530
to stop freedom of expression.
You know,

162
00:09:55.531 --> 00:09:59.310
when I was in college,
my favorite professor,
Roy Halverson,

163
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.430
he was the John Houseman of the journalism school.

164
00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:06.660
He was this old gray eminence and nothing made him happy.

165
00:10:06.661 --> 00:10:11.190
You could never please this,
this,
uh,
this John houseman paper chase guy.

166
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.800
Nothing was good enough.
And,
uh.
