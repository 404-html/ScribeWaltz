00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.520
Hello Freak bitches under 2.5.

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.600
Wow.
Wow,
wow,
wow,
interesting.
Um,
yeah,

3
00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:10.980
but the only way Mcgregor's going to win,

4
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.760
I think if it's under the two and a half.
Oh No,
not in an under two and a half,

5
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:18.780
but by stoppage I think.
Yeah.
Only to imagine him out boxing.
No,

6
00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:19.780
that ain't happening yet.

7
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.540
You're living in a rung fucking planet if you think you've seen to help box,

8
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.910
unless he figures out a way to a mall.
I'm like,

9
00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:30.240
he's done a style like he's doing with withholding the back of the head and

10
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:32.650
throwing punches.
But that's after he's worn Paulie out.
I,

11
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.630
I think you're going to see,

12
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.870
I think you would see Connor using his footwork still that distance trying to,

13
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:39.720
you know,
still do what got them to the dance.
He might,

14
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.370
what if he drops one on Floyd and Floyd go stiff face plants.

15
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.540
I would love that.
I think he's going to land one on Floyd.
I think so.

16
00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:51.900
I think Kinda when's the spectacle?
The probably loses in decision,

17
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.380
but if there is a stoppage it's ICAN or knocking them out.
Well,

18
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.730
you know we're talking today about them going to eight ounce gloves and how how

19
00:00:59.731 --> 00:01:02.880
significant the official commission just granted it that first of all,

20
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:06.510
it shows you,
you can just,
you can just pull those commissioners aside and go,

21
00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:11.430
what's these rule like a slowly drug testing.
Why are we talking about rules?

22
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.820
Let's have some fun here.
Let's have some fun.

23
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.090
I wonder if WME came along like when they bought the UFC.
What?

24
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.940
Boy that was what the Assata Guy?
Yeah.
What's,
we need him.

25
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.130
What's up with the golden snowing?
We got about another six months.
We listen.

26
00:01:26.131 --> 00:01:28.220
Let's just direct that guy towards weight.
Cut It.

27
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.740
You just have him like folks on the gas and the undercarriage and we do that.

28
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.350
We get out of this.
You've shot of them for rails backing up,

29
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.590
backing up percent.
Hundred percent.

30
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.730
Well,
Andre Berto said when he fought Floyd,

31
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.440
he's never been tested more in his life.

32
00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:51.090
He was like four times a week they'd knock on my door like dressed up like

33
00:01:51.091 --> 00:01:54.660
agents.
That's what he says.
He goes,
are you testing Floyd like this?
They go,

34
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.860
that's none of your concern.

35
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.630
He was just the promoters obligation as the promoters.
Floyd Mayweather.
He goes,

36
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.990
you'll figure it out.
He just kept getting tested nonstop.
Yeah.

37
00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:06.810
He wants more of your blood.
He wants you to make you tired,
you know?

38
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.130
I'll tell you what though.

39
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.860
I don't know what the drug tests and it's like on this bad boy,

40
00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:12.870
but with Alvarez fight,

41
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.770
it was interesting because he made canela get down to one 50 you know they

42
00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:19.650
fought at one 50 and can,
they always makes people to come to him.

43
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.670
Like you have to play by his rules and his fight though.
That's what's so scary.

44
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.870
That's why I tip my hat to Floyd because he went out with fight at one 54 that's

45
00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:31.170
like,
that's all right.
That's perfect for Connor.
Yeah.
I would do a dance clubs.

46
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.410
What the Farrell's?
Yeah,
yeah,
we'll do that.

47
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.460
We all take on short notice to this motherfucker is crazy.

48
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.320
I just think he thinks he's so good.

49
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.860
He might just not understand like first of all,

50
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.090
Connor is whether or not you're,

51
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.050
you're looking at his success inside the octagon,

52
00:02:49.051 --> 00:02:52.440
which had been pretty spectacular,
but it's the way he's doing things.

53
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.560
He's got this best show fucking air about him and this very psychotic belief in

54
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.620
himself.
It's a d,
it's not a fake belief.
No,
he's not.

55
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.180
He's not trying to con anybody.

56
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.830
He's trying to manifest like some sort of miraculous existence.

57
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.100
He's trying to be the guy who literally goes in there and drops and smashes

58
00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:19.411
Floyd Mayweather as a UFC fighter and then becomes with that the biggest athlete

59
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.980
on the planet earth ever maybe ever,
ever.

60
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:25.630
If he flatlines Floyd Mayweather,

61
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:30.631
Floyd Mayweather steps in and Connor fucking karate stance stances him and blast

62
00:03:31.381 --> 00:03:35.980
them with a straight left hand and we see Floyd stiffen up and face plant North

63
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.370
Korea nukes where we're going to turn the ocean green shit.
Okay,

64
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.110
this we're all,
we're going to manufacture all of the color,

65
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:46.780
that green color that you put in drinks on Saint Patrick's day,

66
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.420
pouring that shit in the ocean.
We're making the ocean green just all great.

67
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.590
Just huge statues of Conor do going to have people that are faking Irish

68
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.030
accents.
That's sort of like that.
Rachel Dolezal chick pretended to be black,

69
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.040
is going to be people that are changing.
Oh,
on the tiger tattoos on their chest.

70
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.450
They're going to change themselves and become Irish.
They're going to be trans.

71
00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:12.430
It'll get,
that's what the world's going to dunk.
What is that?

72
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.990
When did that happen?
Cargo on Saint Patrick's Day,
they do it really?

73
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.700
Other fish oil on everything.
They really don't do it every year.

74
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.480
Oh my God,
we're so gross.
People are so gross.

75
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.610
Let's have some fun and get fucking hammered and make the ocean greed.
Woo.

76
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.710
The fish are like,
what the fuck?

77
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.710
<v 1>Okay.</v>
