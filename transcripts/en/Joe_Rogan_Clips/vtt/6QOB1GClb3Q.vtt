Your main job is making people laugh and you're fucking side hustle was making

2
00:00:04.061 --> 00:00:07.780
keep making people think that's,
that's an amazing style.
So over,

3
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.740
it's overwhelming though sometimes.
So sometimes I,

4
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.530
I do so many of them and I do some of them on subjects where I'm not even well

5
00:00:14.531 --> 00:00:19.510
read.
I don't,
I don't exactly know if this guest is being honest or if they're,

6
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.340
you know,
budget.
But that's how you feel like that's how you cannot,

7
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.630
you fall into shit.
You don't,
you don't like,
you don't,

8
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.820
you don't wake up and know.
Yeah,
you're wicked.

9
00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:35.290
Wake up curious and you could search and you're honest.

10
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.720
You have an honest and integrity with your audience when you say,

11
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.750
I was wrong about this or I've learned to picked up more of this.

12
00:00:40.751 --> 00:00:42.550
I think that's what it's really about.
You know what I mean?

13
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.860
I don't think it's about being right or knowing all the time.
You,
you,

14
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.210
your forum is very dope because it's conversational and not contrived.

15
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.200
It really is me having the ability to ask.
We were talking,
you know,

16
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.870
Google research have these notes.
I don't know if you know what?
No,

17
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.570
of course you don't take a record.
Sure.

18
00:01:01.571 --> 00:01:05.290
An amazing comic when an amazing [inaudible] we know about the Zapruder film.

19
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.800
They exactly,
yeah.
Gregory brought it to Geraldo Rivera.

20
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.180
I knew this man his last three years of life.
Um,
first of all,

21
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.740
first meeting him,
he cursed me.

22
00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:19.510
And tio is though we'd stolen the tires off his car.
Right?
Why would he say,

23
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.930
well,

24
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.440
me and t I just kind of got on like too Hokey wrappers that kind of saw them.

25
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.540
You know,
it,
it's,
you know,
we're,
we're,

26
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.950
we've embraced the fact that our community looks at us as leaders,
right?

27
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.130
We're not trying to be Dr Keener Macklin,

28
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.800
but we're businessmen were rappers.

29
00:01:35.801 --> 00:01:38.230
We have accountability and responsibility in our community.

30
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.770
So we accept some of what comes with that and we are willing to do things.

31
00:01:41.771 --> 00:01:45.970
So in considering protesting,
considering,
you know,

32
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.530
talking to politicians on the behalf,
tweet and you have to consult with elders.

33
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.320
So we get on the phone with him like,
you know,
so what do we do?

34
00:01:53.321 --> 00:01:56.830
Like kids are getting shot.
We have,
what should we be engaged or should we wait?

35
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.350
Should we march,
March,
March,

36
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.970
<v 1>nick,
nick,
Nigga,
what the fuck you go march.</v>

37
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.630
We be March 15 years ago.
You know,
they don't open that street up.

38
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.870
Let you mark tell you clothe itself and then shoot your ass if you,
you're

39
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.200
<v 0>just like,
oh shit.
I never actually,</v>

40
00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:17.520
I never thought of that.

41
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.110
And this is more serious than we're showing up and were angry.

42
00:02:22.111 --> 00:02:24.840
This is confronting government.

43
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.660
And once government has Shane,

44
00:02:27.661 --> 00:02:31.980
you do something a few times you have to practice guerrilla warfare or you're

45
00:02:31.981 --> 00:02:34.290
just doing what the British did that lost them.
America,

46
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.890
you're stepping up in a formation,
shooting your shot,
falling back,

47
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:38.790
stepping up for,

48
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.510
you're just playing a fucking game where they're dancing versus doing things

49
00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:46.230
that really disrupt the system and things that really progress the move.

50
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.160
And I was like,
Oh shit.
You know,
this is radically,

51
00:02:50.161 --> 00:02:54.030
this guys is more than just a funny man and he's more just stay.

52
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.850
He's really sacrificing lady that shit down.
So yeah,

53
00:02:56.851 --> 00:02:58.770
we got cursed out by Dick Gregory.
Tip Hung Up.

54
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.740
Why you didn't call me back later light man,
you know,
like,
Hey,

55
00:03:01.741 --> 00:03:05.370
my phone messed up tall,
you know,
talk cool.
It's my phone hung up dog.

56
00:03:05.371 --> 00:03:08.550
I don't know how say,
