00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.970
Anyway,
MMA math is ridiculous.
It doesn't work.

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.430
And you might be the best example of how it doesn't work.
But so you go to this,

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.930
the,
the Mayo Clinic puts you on antidepressants because you just feel like shit.

4
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.430
<v 1>Well,
I feel like shit.
And because like of the,</v>

5
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.030
the different endocrine problems that I had,
right.
So I can't have,
um,

6
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.090
any of the medications that'll help that.

7
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.100
So I have to be more conservative with it.

8
00:00:24.101 --> 00:00:27.460
And one way they thought to do it is because my cortisol levels are really high.

9
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.760
They're talking about,
um,
and I mean,
granted I have a lot of stress,

10
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.820
especially like,
you know,
life hasn't been easy.

11
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.600
<v 0>That's a single mom.
Your husband passes away.
You're in the toughest,</v>

12
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.150
probably the toughest sport on the planet.
I'm trying to be the best at it.
Yeah,

13
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.870
you're elite,
you're in the top 10.
So you're,

14
00:00:43.871 --> 00:00:47.440
you're in this weird position where you never know when you're going to fire to

15
00:00:47.441 --> 00:00:49.100
who you're going to find,
does it constant amounts to,

16
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.130
and it's not like you're making millions of dollars doing it either.

17
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.440
<v 1>No.
Well and it's expediting healing for me in,</v>

18
00:00:54.441 --> 00:00:56.690
and I also have a kid going through what I'm going through,

19
00:00:56.691 --> 00:01:00.500
so it's not like I get to like split and cut corners and just,
you know,

20
00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:04.670
it's like there's maintenance to be done at all times with that.
So I go there,

21
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:05.910
they tell me,
you know,

22
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.720
we could probably lower your coders all levels if we could load or lower your

23
00:01:08.721 --> 00:01:12.710
stress levels.
So we'll try it.
Antidepressants,
what did that make you feel like?

24
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.810
Flat as fuck and like I didn't am I came up,
can I say fuck on this?
Okay.

25
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.430
I know,
I just didn't know if I have a quota.
I'm like a bad person.

26
00:01:22.431 --> 00:01:25.730
Like did I get handed to like a Doug get added to a certain level,

27
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.720
zero restrictions.
You can say whatever you want in the shade on right.
Done.
Okay.

28
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.620
Okay.
So there's no one listening.
Okay,
got it.
Um,

29
00:01:33.621 --> 00:01:37.880
so yeah,
they,
they put me on,
they usually have flat flat,

30
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.470
which like all that training camp getting ready for Juliana.
I'm just like,

31
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.890
I'm like,
okay,
I'll,
it'll,
it'll take off in the fight.
Like,

32
00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:49.640
I feel good in the fight.
Like when they say go and run the loon,
that no,
no ups,

33
00:01:49.641 --> 00:01:54.470
no downs,
no,
no pissed off,
like want to kill,
you know,

34
00:01:54.471 --> 00:01:59.330
nothing,
you know,
and show,
not scared but not happy.
No.
And I was like,

35
00:01:59.331 --> 00:02:02.690
why am I not nervous the way that I get nervous?
Like,
like,

36
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.250
like I was okay.
Which you usually like,
especially two weeks out,

37
00:02:07.251 --> 00:02:09.920
I have this like flesh of emotions,
you know,
where I'm like,

38
00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:14.410
fetal position in the corner,
like what the fuck?
And then once it's over,

39
00:02:14.411 --> 00:02:18.980
all I want to do is kill,
you know.
But,
uh,
again,
I didn't have that either.

40
00:02:18.981 --> 00:02:22.820
What kind of made me nervous because my,
my other friend buyer pancheck we,
she,

41
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.340
she's a new 20 fiver.
Um,

42
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.150
we would always like call each other and laugh at how dumb we are being at that

43
00:02:29.151 --> 00:02:33.620
point.
Like,
look at me,
you know?
And uh,

44
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.830
but that was all gone with the,
yeah,
but what should,
did they put you on?
Um,
oh,

45
00:02:38.831 --> 00:02:43.700
is this one?
Oh my gosh.
So off Paxil,
keep going.

46
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.530
Um,
Prozac,
what do they have?
Uh,
do you know what I mean?

47
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.260
Jamie affects her fixer,
the fixer and James playing stupid over the

48
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.770
crazy pills
twice a day.
Just kidding.
Just tic tacs

49
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.210
<v 0>tries them out.
Um,
so,</v>

50
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.270
so they put you on this stuff and did they try different ones?

51
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.240
<v 1>Uh,
no,
because,
uh,
not a lot of time there isn't it?</v>

52
00:03:12.241 --> 00:03:14.890
You know,
and,
and they're looking,
I'm like,
I need the side,

53
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.060
the side effects matter.

54
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:18.500
Like these can't be ones that made me gain a bunch of weight.
Right.

55
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.390
They can't make me like,
like I need to still be able to sleep.

56
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:26.140
Like I have to be able to have like enough highs and lows to be able to function

57
00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:29.740
and learn and,
and whatever.
And so this is like the best they,

58
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.750
they could have for me.
So anyway,
I,
I fight that fight with Juliana.
You know,
I,

59
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.510
I feel like the first round I came out how I wanted,
you know,

60
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:40.750
and then halfway through the second round,
like it was just awful.

61
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:45.040
Like she had my old coaches in her corner.

62
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.720
You know what's weird about that fight is I could hear you and I could like I,

63
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.150
this is where the flat came in is like I wasn't,

64
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.620
I didn't feel like I was in the fight.

65
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.620
Like I could see herb Dean's feet and I could hear you talking about us and I,

66
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.890
I saw like I could hear Juliana's coaches and it was breaking my heart that they

67
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:10.291
were coaching against me because they were my Colorado gym and she went and

68
00:04:10.301 --> 00:04:12.880
trained with them and I know she had trained with them previously.

69
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.800
So I mean before she had taken a fight.
But to me it was like fucked up to here,

70
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.710
you know?
And it hurt me in a way,
like it's,

71
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.140
I wish I could explain it better,

72
00:04:23.141 --> 00:04:26.340
but it was like I heard them and I just wanted to go home.
You know,

73
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.450
I look at the clock and I'm like,
kitten,
this just be over.

74
00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:29.950
I don't want to go back to Colorado.

75
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.760
I want to move like in and I literally on this side of the cage,

76
00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:38.020
I had my past in Colorado,
I had these coaches,
I had the drama with that,

77
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:41.320
with that Jim,
like how everything went and,

78
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.060
and then on this side it was like all new problems like San Diego,
Eric,

79
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:48.580
and then we're good.
Like there was a lot of shading partners there.
It was sunny,

80
00:04:48.581 --> 00:04:52.120
it was similar to Colorado at different but in the right ways,
you know,

81
00:04:52.121 --> 00:04:52.860
and it's like,
okay,

82
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:53.970
<v 0>I just wanted it out of fight.</v>

83
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.230
You were in San Diego trainer for that fight or no?
Yeah,
I can't,

84
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.470
I just flew out for it.
For,
for the training camp and why you flew out there,

85
00:05:01.471 --> 00:05:04.310
you were still taking the antidepressants and did it,

86
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.720
did that fight convince you to stop taking them?

87
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.630
<v 1>Yeah.
So after that fight I went to a,
what did I do?</v>

88
00:05:11.631 --> 00:05:14.090
I think I went to the,
I was at the Pi,

89
00:05:14.091 --> 00:05:17.720
I was working with Novinski and people on like what to do about that.

90
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.580
I haven't talked to Gordon,
Dr. Gordon,
Mark Gordon,
yeah.
To,
um,

91
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:23.990
help me with all of that too.

92
00:05:23.991 --> 00:05:26.930
Cause he thought there was a more conservative way to help me with those issues

93
00:05:26.931 --> 00:05:31.900
as well.
And so I knew I was talking with him.
I had him talk to them.
Uh,

94
00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.250
they were all trying to figure out a way,
but so there's like,

95
00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.930
there's no way to even just naturally bring you up to think about retiring.
Yeah.

96
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.950
And that,
that's the thing is the center was really the place that was,
is like,

97
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.370
okay,
I'm going to go here.
I've tried everything else.

98
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.810
I'm going to go here and if they can't fix me then,
then I'm,

99
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.140
I'm going to have to be done.
