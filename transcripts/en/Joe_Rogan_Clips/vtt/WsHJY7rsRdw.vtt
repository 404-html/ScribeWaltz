1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.170
The joe rogan experience for girls,
don't you think way worse.

2
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.690
Crazier men are dangerous and that's why we have a system called the patriarchy

3
00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:12.700
took to women.
Like Michael Costa has a bit about,

4
00:00:12.701 --> 00:00:16.340
I have a great system to protect women from the dangers of men called Patriarchy

5
00:00:16.341 --> 00:00:19.640
and we threw it.
We Lord,
we threw it away.
Cause ecologist,

6
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.820
I think it's important to talk about patriarchy because I feel that young 20

7
00:00:23.821 --> 00:00:26.370
year old women need their own Illuminati to talk about,
you know,

8
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.790
totally in their failures.
Got Us going on.
It's,
yeah,

9
00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:34.700
it's like it's Illuminati for girls.
Fight
Patriarchy.

10
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.700
[inaudible] ask for the set definition.
There isn't one.
Is that a suspicious?

11
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.910
Same with racism.
Just one in the dictionary,
but that's not the accepted one.

12
00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:44.700
Ask just any on my feminist.
What does it mean?
There's no,

13
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.880
well you can be whatever you want to be like.
It's,
it's,

14
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.980
it means you're my ex boyfriend named Gary Click of mean girls is that

15
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:53.700
patriarchy are in a position of power.
That's the patriarchy.

16
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.310
But men have been in the workplace for hundreds of years more than women is that

17
00:00:57.311 --> 00:01:00.720
there's a real problem.
Well it should be caught up.

18
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.660
But what about when to hear this shit where somebody goes,

19
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.930
when people wonder where all the female Comedians,
I like no.

20
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.730
Who said that to people talking about it when it,

21
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.350
when Louie got shellacked by that fucked up article with people were saying that

22
00:01:13.351 --> 00:01:15.210
shit about,
you know what,

23
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.640
how come there's an equal number of female comedians to males?

24
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.480
Well cause women are treated better in our society.
Yeah.

25
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.640
If there's a female comedians,
you know,

26
00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:27.330
women are being abused way more than ever because you don't get in this job from

27
00:01:27.331 --> 00:01:31.200
a happy,
his job isn't about support.
It's you get last cause you're fucked up.

28
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.710
So I hope there's not a lot of women in it that would mean they're being raped

29
00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:39.450
more.
There's that.
But it is also,
it's just from a female perspective,

30
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.620
if a chick's funny,
it's harder because something happened to her.
They can't,

31
00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:45.720
but they can't talk about certain things like,
no,

32
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.050
no man wants to see a woman on stage town politic stories or politic jokes.

33
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.920
If it's funny you say that,
but they did create a lot of the daily show.

34
00:01:55.921 --> 00:02:00.090
Maybe you,
maybe you,
but most people in the audience,
the woman,

35
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.110
I won't rule out anything.
I'll take,
I won't say any premises Hacky,

36
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.640
just punch line.
So if your premise is airline fucking peanuts such fine,

37
00:02:08.641 --> 00:02:11.460
tell me what your punchline is.
Maybe your punchline justifies it.
I don't,

38
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.690
I don't,
I won't rule out any premise.

39
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.810
Premise is or hacky,
but people probably don't want to hear it,
but who you know,

40
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.710
it's like,
look,

41
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.100
if you can get people to listen to some shit that they basically don't want to

42
00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:26.910
hear,
like,
oh great,
this is from,
I used to do the black rooms when I started out.

43
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.700
You're talking agreed with you.
I'm totally in agreement with you.

44
00:02:29.701 --> 00:02:32.730
We're not talking.
What are they drinking?
Caveman coffee.
We're not talking.

45
00:02:32.731 --> 00:02:33.040
He says,

46
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.010
I feel wired as wicked wire from that 270 milligrams.

47
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.130
How many did you might go?
Well,
I just started sipping wine,
but I'm like,

48
00:02:41.131 --> 00:02:44.700
I feel like one that's empty.
Did you black out and suck though?
And Justin,

49
00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:49.200
I just drank one.
What the fuck is this dude?
It's a debt talking about me.

50
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.730
I'm talking about most when a woman goes on stage and does stand up,

51
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.380
most people that are going to be in the audience,

52
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.830
there's men that are just not going to want to hear you talk about politics.

53
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.940
There's men that are not going to want to hear you talk about sex.

54
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.330
It's harder for a woman.
I think it's a hard,
it's a harder position.

55
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.870
Being a standup comic for a woman is just harder.
So I think if it's harder,

56
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.810
you're naturally going to see less people doing it and then there's naturally

57
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:13.870
less people inclined to do it,
but it's just like female MMA.

58
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.750
Like most women are not going to do it.
But guess what?
A lot of women do it.

59
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.120
If you're the type that does it,
you fucking do it,
but there's no fucking would.

60
00:03:20.121 --> 00:03:23.920
What about the Patriarchy in MMA?
Why through equal number of women than men?

61
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.300
You don't say that right.

62
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.370
I noticed that.
Remember who the lead.
That's it.

63
00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:34.000
I think it's cause it's an untenable argument.
What you can't say.

64
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:37.320
This should be an equal amount of women fighting as men because it's not.

65
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.450
That's what,
and punch in the face area.

66
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.220
That's one area where we agree it's one area we get to a goal yet,
well men,

67
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.770
they do this better.
This is,
they do it more.

68
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.400
They're doing it constantly and there's some elite female athletes in MMA,

69
00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:54.010
don't get me wrong,
rivaled the elite athletes and men,

70
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:57.850
but they used to submit and they had the operation way more men fucking way
more.

71
00:03:57.851 --> 00:04:01.650
I mean it's not even seen with basketball and WSP.
Right.

72
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.550
But this is what my point is the same as standup.
Yeah.

73
00:04:04.551 --> 00:04:08.110
Cause standups another getting punched in the face sport to me like it's super

74
00:04:08.111 --> 00:04:11.710
fucking difficult.
You take an emotional beat.
Some people don't want to do it.

75
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.620
It's not a judgment call.
It's not like you're better or you're worse.

76
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.210
I think I picked you because the people that left that I started,

77
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.600
I don't know if you think of when you started,

78
00:04:19.601 --> 00:04:21.720
people who thought that were funny,
that left right,

79
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.000
and people that stage or he can't believe you're still here.

80
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.330
It's clearly a calling and not a,
yeah,
you got to be able to take a beating.

81
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.980
Some people just decide to,
they've had enough.
They like,

82
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:31.960
they don't want to get off this fucking ride.
You know,

83
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:34.750
there's a lot of guys that were like big time touring headliners and they got to

84
00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:37.910
a point in there where the,
fuck this,
we usually go to Vegas or something.
Yeah,

85
00:04:37.911 --> 00:04:41.020
yeah,
they do that.
Or they just fucking get some sort of a writing job.

86
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.130
Sometimes get writing jobs.
They started doing tree work like me.

87
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.130
They moved to the middle of nowhere.
Freeze outside,

88
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.400
just start cutting down trees.
You know,
I was,
I liked the writer's guild,

89
00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:52.091
but listen,
man,

90
00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:56.290
anybody who thinks there should be an equal number of men or women in any job

91
00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.320
and that if there's no clear evidence that this is a neutral occupation,

92
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.560
that this is an occupation that doesn't favor any gender.

93
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.130
Like there's gotta be jobs where it's equally represented,
men and women.

94
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.520
Outside of that,
your job,
it's what you choose to do with your life.

95
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.080
When the boys grow up playing with fucking trucks and superheros and girls grow

96
00:05:17.081 --> 00:05:21.220
up playing with dolls and they obviously are more inclined in this direction and

97
00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:25.090
men are more inclined in that direction that we expect them to meet at any

98
00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:28.390
interest.
And then we w that we would force it and force it,

99
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.290
ruins it for women.
It makes them think that they should do jobs,

100
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:34.990
that they might not enjoy it and then they get really depressed.
Right?
Yeah.

101
00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:38.380
Or they think,
did they need to prove themselves by doing a man's job?
Exactly.

102
00:05:38.381 --> 00:05:41.470
Instead of just doing what they actually enjoy doing.
Well,
I mean,
you know,

103
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.431
it's funny.
When I was a kid,

104
00:05:42.431 --> 00:05:45.640
I remember my mom wanted to work and she got a job and then she was mad because

105
00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:48.850
she wanted to stop working because it's so,
yeah.
Um,
but uh,

106
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.340
I mean it just depends on the level of need,
right?

107
00:05:51.341 --> 00:05:53.560
Like what if there's like a war or a bad economy?

108
00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:56.620
So I'm guessing what I'm going to go get people.
That's a different thing,
right?

109
00:05:56.621 --> 00:05:57.830
It's different.
The poor,

110
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.820
like everybody was sort of bonded together because you know,

111
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.490
they have a make shit constantly seems to be a much more of a,
I,

112
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.110
you know,
I was telling my girlfriend,
my girlfriend's a car,
like you were like,

113
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.180
I realize this is,

114
00:06:10.181 --> 00:06:14.330
it even ties in with this jazz night thing because I realized like where she

115
00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:17.300
realized that like half the bad things that happened to her in the last four

116
00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:21.600
years were social media related or more maybe all of them.

117
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.980
I'm thinking about it like if I think of all the bullshit like stress on my life

118
00:06:24.981 --> 00:06:28.040
that I had from fucking social media is real though.

119
00:06:28.041 --> 00:06:31.670
Like I've had a couple of theaters,
cancer chats,
like ruined my life.

120
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.290
I mean strangers like set out,
I'm going to ruin your life.
Like where?
I was like,

121
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:39.770
wow,
you got a lot of good it.
It costs money now.
It's crazy.

122
00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:44.720
That's when required you get theaters council for I booked to art schools.

123
00:06:44.721 --> 00:06:49.220
I just paid them to rent it like the area and I sold it out myself and then they

124
00:06:49.221 --> 00:06:52.940
would just cancel saying that I do hate speech or something.
What's the saying?

125
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.510
Ah,
there's one merit in Chicago and then Brooklyn School of music.

126
00:06:56.511 --> 00:06:59.540
Just cats on me and I had to switch it that day.
Chicago and Brooklyn though.

127
00:06:59.541 --> 00:07:00.430
Or like hotbeds.

128
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.040
Well Frizzell Chicago was filled with how social and that social shit.

129
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.570
Like I'm a,
I'm a piano player.
I say as Gw,
social jihad is no good.

130
00:07:08.571 --> 00:07:11.780
And I thought that was like my safe spot.
I'm like,
dude,

131
00:07:11.781 --> 00:07:15.680
I'm a piano player in Chicago is so full.
Like dude,
everywhere is,

132
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.680
it's like the nothing from the neverending story.
It's just like everywhere now.

133
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.170
Well,
you know,
dude,
if you go to these underserved markets,

134
00:07:21.171 --> 00:07:24.020
like Detroit's right there,
there's people that want to want to see in Detroit,

135
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:29.590
Detroit,
mark be fucking amazing
track is that the fucking area was,

136
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.780
and I did this place.
Oh,
small some rock dude.
It was tremendous.
Yeah,

137
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.520
I had a great time in Detroit.
I did that.
Fillmore did two shows there.

138
00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:40.940
It was amazing for sports in there like seven years ago.
I was sick.

139
00:07:40.941 --> 00:07:42.980
Fucking fun man.
They appreciate you.
Well,

140
00:07:42.981 --> 00:07:44.720
it's easy to forget or happy to be there.

141
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.560
You know this horse shit because it's this cult that these people are in that's

142
00:07:48.561 --> 00:07:51.380
in Hollywood and New York and Chicago religious there.

143
00:07:51.381 --> 00:07:54.170
It's not view the rest of the country.
People want,
you know,

144
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.080
this is a thing that you get fooled with social media is you think this is like

145
00:07:57.081 --> 00:08:00.330
reality,
but it is everywhere.
But they don't like it.
That's the difference.
Like,

146
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.960
like Hollywood can have people being like,
oh no,
this is great.

147
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.810
But it is in other,
uh,

148
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:08.720
colleges and like our college kids write me that they have to sign a white

149
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.120
privileged contract.
It like the college.
I've seen them.

150
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.810
At least they know it means they acknowledged their white privilege,

151
00:08:14.811 --> 00:08:16.580
which is basically,
I don't know,
it's something that happened.

152
00:08:16.581 --> 00:08:18.210
She's what for genocide or whatnot,

153
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:21.200
but we put you acknowledge your white privilege.
You have it easier.

154
00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:23.420
That's amazing.
I've never heard of it though.
It's unreal.

155
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.560
They're giving kids in certain schools are giving kids lectures on gender and

156
00:08:27.561 --> 00:08:29.240
that how some people are gender fluid,

157
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:33.320
meaning that they can switch back and forth from male to female and anytime like

158
00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:37.640
it wouldn't wait time.
Do we go,
okay,
maybe that's true,

159
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:40.250
but what's the odds that that's nonsense?

160
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.860
The I 100% overwhelming.

161
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:47.210
Kimmy might be someone with some sort of a psychological disorders where they do

162
00:08:47.211 --> 00:08:49.370
bounce back and forth between being a man,
a woman,

163
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.820
but at what point in time could we recognize this is a psychological disorder

164
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.650
and this is just not a natural state of being like having red hair.
By the way.

165
00:08:55.651 --> 00:08:59.770
Also,
I don't give a shit like I know it's nice that involve me.

166
00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:04.350
I need to teach kids at school,
are you going to be your,
they go like,
well,

167
00:09:04.351 --> 00:09:06.030
white is considered default.
I'm like,

168
00:09:06.031 --> 00:09:08.430
well that's because it's a majority white population.

169
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:12.030
Like default doesn't mean cause I don't understand what people are finding is by

170
00:09:12.031 --> 00:09:13.990
default.
What do you mean?
It doesn't make any sense though.

171
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.060
Like when people go flesh colored bandaids or white,

172
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.490
which I don't even know if that's still true brown bandaids,
but it's,

173
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.590
it's literally a matter a matter of like populate,

174
00:09:22.591 --> 00:09:26.040
like why are you fighting to be default or like the boring,

175
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.310
like I became a comedian to be marginal.
Like on the margins.

176
00:09:29.311 --> 00:09:30.720
I didn't want to be in the main dude.

177
00:09:30.721 --> 00:09:34.230
My hydration margin I get going if I can't go on a fucking horror coaster with

178
00:09:34.231 --> 00:09:36.000
the answer.
The bandaid thing,
it's very easy.

179
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:37.920
At the time that bandaids were invented,

180
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.550
it was a far greater population of white people.
Yeah,
no shit.

181
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.050
There's more now that's like,

182
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.810
would they say within 30 years white people are going to be the minority.

183
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:50.760
I think we're also looking forward to it.
Yeah.
Well she is my kid white.

184
00:09:50.761 --> 00:09:55.110
I don't even know.
Your kid is definitely not white and your kids half Mexican.

185
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.840
Yes,
we can.
I spoke this in here by the way.
Yeah,
sure.

186
00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.730
I'd rather you not marijuana.
Yeah.
What do you got going on there?

187
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:02.260
Some little glass pipe.
Yeah.

188
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:07.490
It's a chillum chillum that's what these fish concert pipe I've shown him was

189
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.620
that thing they do with Hash.
Ah,
sure.
But that's what it,
I mean,
yeah,

190
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.240
it's just the same thing.
So just a a one hitter.
We got joints here.

191
00:10:15.241 --> 00:10:17.440
If you want to spark a joint,
but do want to start,
we can join it.

192
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.280
I think it's cause it's student jet that all this shit's happening because of

193
00:10:20.281 --> 00:10:24.100
what?
Student debt?
No,
is where a lot of fucking,

194
00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:28.890
no one's going to get a job from underwater vagina ballet.
The economy tanked.

195
00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.890
All of a sudden there's money to be made and there's 60 grand in debt for

196
00:10:31.891 --> 00:10:34.860
underwater vagina ballet and then they have to like justify it somehow.

197
00:10:34.861 --> 00:10:37.710
It's crazy.
First of all,
if you are an expert,
underwater vagina ballet,

198
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.410
that's a marketable skill team.
Yeah.

199
00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.053
<v 1>Okay.</v>

200
00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:50.700
Okay.
