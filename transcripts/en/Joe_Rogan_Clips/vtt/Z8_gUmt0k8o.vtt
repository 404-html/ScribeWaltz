00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.100
Her low freak bitches.
Are you in an unmanageable position now though?

2
00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:09.480
As far as like responding to people because like I try to respond to people,

3
00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:11.970
but I can't.
It's not possible.
It's not possible.

4
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.650
I would imagine like the over the last few months it must be just overwhelming.

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.120
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well I've given up trying to keep up on my email.
It's just not,

6
00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:23.610
my wife helps me out.
I've had some other people helped me,

7
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:25.030
but you know what I do is I,

8
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.700
I look and I tried to say thank you to people and write them a couple of lines

9
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.790
when I have a moment.
But you know,
because I can't get to all of it.

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.480
They just come in by the,
so I know that position.
Right.

11
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.800
And it's too bad because people are writing me very heartfelt long letters.

12
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.570
They're often brilliant,
frequently,
like amazing letters telling me,

13
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.980
you know,
their experiences with the authoritarian left or,
or,

14
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.330
or the way they've been cornered in,
in one way or another or,

15
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.150
or how starting to clean up the room changed their life.

16
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.090
That's quite fun because it's something I always tell people to do instead of

17
00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:04.770
going out and protesting Jesus.
I just can't stand up the room.
Yeah.

18
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.670
Meaning,
well,
my sense is is that if you want to change the world,

19
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:12.330
you start from yourself and work outward because you build your competence that

20
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:13.200
way.
It's like,

21
00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:16.770
I don't know how you can go out and protest the structure of the entire economic

22
00:01:16.771 --> 00:01:19.290
system if can't keep your room organized.
Yeah.

23
00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:20.580
Isn't that an issue with people though,

24
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:25.581
that they always want to enact some sort of control over the outside world when

25
00:01:25.831 --> 00:01:27.630
they're inside is all fucked up.
Yeah.

26
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.150
It was also people that are the most adamant about it.
Well,

27
00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:34.530
I think there's some truth in that.
Um,
I think there is truth in that.
I mean,

28
00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:37.590
people try to change the outside world for lots of ways,

29
00:01:37.591 --> 00:01:42.210
but many of those ways aren't just pure good.
But you know,
I've thought about,

30
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.840
well,
I made a video call which was called message to millennials where I was,

31
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.590
it was called how to change the world properly.
A bit of a,

32
00:01:49.591 --> 00:01:52.230
on the pretentious side I suppose.
But,
um,

33
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.620
I was trying to produce something that was a counter position to this idea that

34
00:01:55.621 --> 00:01:59.430
what you should do is go out and fix up other people.
You know,

35
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.820
that's just not right.
And there's a new testament line about that.

36
00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:04.170
Something about,
you know,

37
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:08.490
not worrying too much about the log in your neighbor's eye or about the speck in

38
00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:12.540
your neighbor's eye when you have a log in your eye.
So like,
yes,
no kidding,

39
00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:15.420
but you know,
do you really want to,
do you really want to face that?

40
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.640
And so what I've thought about is that,
well,

41
00:02:17.641 --> 00:02:22.170
what you start to do is you start to tell and act out the truth locally,

42
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.620
like within the domain of your actual competence.
You know,

43
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.860
cause the world presents itself as a series of puzzles,

44
00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:32.400
some of which you're capable of solving and some of which you're not.

45
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.330
And you have many puzzles in front of you that you could solve,

46
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:37.590
but you choose not to.

47
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.310
You know that those are the things that weigh on your conscience.
It's like,

48
00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:43.920
you know why I should really do this?
But you don't.
It's like,

49
00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:47.580
so I had this idea a long time ago because the world is a pretty dreadful place.

50
00:02:47.581 --> 00:02:47.941
I thought,

51
00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:52.470
well what would the world be like if people stopped avoiding the things they

52
00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:54.090
knew they should do?
You know?

53
00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:59.091
Cause the question is how much are we contributing to the fact that life is a,

54
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.780
is an existential catastrophe and a tragedy?

55
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:04.840
How much is our own corruption contributing to that?

56
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.850
How to really worthwhile question things.
You leave undone because you're angry,

57
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:11.950
you're resentful,
you're lazy,
you have a neuro Shia,

58
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.370
well you consult your conscience and it says,
well,
you know,

59
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.650
that place over there could use a little work.

60
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.390
It's the same as working on yourself.
And so you clean that up because you can,

61
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.920
and then things are a little clearer around you and you're a little better off

62
00:03:26.921 --> 00:03:29.980
because you've practiced a bit and,
and so you're little stronger.

63
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:32.170
And then in something else manifest itself and says,

64
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:35.140
well maybe you could like take a crack at fixing me up too.

65
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.250
So he decided to do that.
And then that gets a little bit more pristine,
you know,

66
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:40.790
and soon.
And it's,

67
00:03:40.791 --> 00:03:45.460
it's humble because you're not exceeding your domain of competence.
You know,

68
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.640
it's like don't be fixing up the economy.
18 year olds,

69
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.540
you don't know anything about the economy.
It's a massive,

70
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:55.240
complex machine beyond anyone's understanding.

71
00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.040
And you mess with it at your peril.
So when can you even clean up your own room?

72
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.640
No.
Well,
you should think about that.

73
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.410
You should think about that.
Cause if you can't even clean up your own room,

74
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.420
who the hell are you to give advice to the world?
That's so very,

75
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:15.160
very important thing for people to hear.

76
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.610
