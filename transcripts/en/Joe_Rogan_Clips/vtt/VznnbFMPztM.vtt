1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.470
When you get to those numbers,

2
00:00:01.471 --> 00:00:04.980
when you're talking about trillions and billions and all those zeros,

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.560
my brain just goes numb.
I,

4
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:11.850
there's this lack of comprehension that I'm well aware of.

5
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.300
Like those numbers get thrown about.
I go,
ah,
200 billion.
Hmm.
No I haven't.

6
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.530
It's just fruit.
And I think everybody does.
I think every scientist that,

7
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.350
no scientists can picture that number.
I mean he even the small number,

8
00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:29.670
200 billion,
the number of stars in one galaxy,

9
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.810
and then when you say 2 trillion galaxies,
it,
you know,
that that's,

10
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.740
I challenge anyone to be able to picture that.

11
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.120
But it is the reality that we've observed.
We've,
you know,
we,

12
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.640
I mean we haven't canceled l 2 trillion by the way.
We have,

13
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.920
we have a thing called the Sloan digital sky survey,

14
00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:50.010
which maps the positions of galaxies.
So you can,

15
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.060
you know how much of the sky you surveyed and you know how many galaxies you can

16
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.650
sit and then you can spread that across the wider universe and you get this

17
00:00:58.651 --> 00:01:02.400
picture of a vast and possibly infinite universe meet.
We,

18
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.050
we know that the universe are very strongly suspected.

19
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.370
The university is much bigger than the piece we can see.

20
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.760
So we have good reason to think that's the case.

21
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.910
Whether it's infinite or not is another question.
And then that goes to your,

22
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.770
you know,
the,
can you pitch your infinity well,

23
00:01:17.771 --> 00:01:21.150
no one can picture infinity does it.
This was a weird thing as well about,

24
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.930
you know,
we say the universe began 13.8 billion years ago.

25
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.280
So that's a measurement because we can measure the speed.

26
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.010
All the galaxies are flying away from us essentially.

27
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.980
And then you said you can run time backwards if you like.

28
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.230
So to find out when they were all on top of each other.

29
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.570
And so it's a quite simple measurement and we've done that.

30
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.780
So we say the universe began 13.8 billion years ago.

31
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.530
But actually all we know really was the universe was very hot and very dense at

32
00:01:46.531 --> 00:01:47.340
that time.

33
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.820
And we have some theories that the universe was in existence before that and

34
00:01:50.821 --> 00:01:53.460
perhaps some sort of circumstantial evidence.

35
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.830
And that means that actually the universe could,

36
00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.000
could have always been there eternal.
And,
um,
when it,
when I talked to people,

37
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:03.150
sometimes they get a bit,
some people get upset about that.

38
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.100
Some people would rather it had a beginning.

39
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.710
The idea that it might have been around forever is more frightening somehow than

40
00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:12.990
the fact that it began.
And,
uh,
it's,

41
00:02:12.991 --> 00:02:16.310
it's interesting the way people's minds work.
What,

42
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.400
what terrifies you the most and eternal universe or a finite universe?

43
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.170
The other both incomprehensible.
The eternal universe.

44
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.020
W W if there was an eternal universe,

45
00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:32.160
is that negate the theory of the big bang or does it mean that there is a

46
00:02:32.161 --> 00:02:37.161
constant cycle of big bangs and then expansion and then recompression or,

47
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.330
yeah,
it could do.
So those theories are back in vogue.

48
00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:45.030
Some of those theories are back in vogue again.
So yes,

49
00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:48.700
some of them say that there's a cycling universe.
Um,

50
00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:53.340
so the big bang is an event when space gets very hot and very dense and filled

51
00:02:53.341 --> 00:02:58.050
with particles.
And that may happen again or some of the other theories.
Uh,

52
00:02:58.051 --> 00:03:01.270
there's a theory called eternal,
which is a theory that,

53
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.510
and it's actually the most popular theory I think at the moment,

54
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.630
but what happened,
but why the big bang is the way that it is,

55
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.870
who's got some very special features,
a big bang,
which we could talk about it,

56
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:15.871
but inflation is the idea that space spacetime was around before the big bang

57
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.310
and it was expanding extremely fast.

58
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.970
And there was doubling in size in the most popular of these theories.

59
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.460
Every 10 to the minus 37 seconds,
which is point.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,

60
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.240
not with 37 knots.
One of a second.
So there's an only imaginably fast expansion.

61
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.030
And then the idea is that draws to a close,

62
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.000
so quite naturally sort of dies away in the expansion,

63
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:41.670
slows down and all the energy that was taken there was causing that expansions

64
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.950
sort of gets dumped into space and heats it up and makes particles.

65
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.510
And that's what we call the big bang.

66
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.850
And those theories that slight extension to those,
um,
say that,

67
00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:56.410
that,
that slowing down just happens in little patches.
So most of the universe,

68
00:03:56.411 --> 00:04:01.411
the overwhelming majority of the university still inflating that insane speed

69
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.520
and that just little patchy stop and their big banks.

70
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.030
So you get multiple universities,
a multiverse,

71
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.780
it's called the inflationary multiverse,
and we are in one of those bubbles.

72
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.210
And that's one of the more popular theories.
