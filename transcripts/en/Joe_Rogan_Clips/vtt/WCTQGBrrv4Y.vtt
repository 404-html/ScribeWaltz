WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.020
It.
It really,

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.130
it's almost like we're dealing with crude tools like we're trying to perform

3
00:00:05.131 --> 00:00:08.570
surgery with hatchets like,
fuck man.

4
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.210
<v 1>How do you get to those people and have that discussion with all those people?</v>

5
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.410
I mean in terms of there being too much to to talk about and cover.

6
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.070
That's where I do think that things like the New York Times can make a real

7
00:00:21.071 --> 00:00:26.071
contribution because we like there are adults in the room deciding what the

8
00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:32.170
important news is that you should pay attention to.
Yes,
in theory at least.
Well,

9
00:00:32.171 --> 00:00:35.410
no,
I I wholeheartedly agree.
You know,

10
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.250
you're going to learn about the genocide of the weaker Muslims in the New York

11
00:00:39.251 --> 00:00:41.490
Times.
Like if you really read the New York Times every day,

12
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.160
you're going to know a lot about the world and you're going to understand that

13
00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:49.330
the government shutdown is a bigger deal than what happened on the steps of the

14
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.160
Lincoln Memorial.
If you're just trolling through Twitter,

15
00:00:51.161 --> 00:00:55.510
which is how like every person I know,
or Twitter or snapchat or whatever,

16
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.940
like my youngest sister,
how she gets her news,

17
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.380
you're not going to necessarily know that.
That's a real problem.

18
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.060
It is.

19
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.680
I don't know how to solve it other than tell people to subscribe to newspapers,

20
00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:11.950
which still have some standards and which still when they make a mistake,

21
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.140
correct.
The mistake.

22
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.090
<v 0>How many of those are left?
There's a few.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

23
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.960
I work at one of them.
You work one of them.
You definitely do.
I mean,
look,

24
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.790
I said something to someone from the New York Times Online,
uh,
after,
uh,

25
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.370
an article that they wrote about a fight.

26
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.670
There was a boxing match and Conor McGregor and Floyd Mayweather,

27
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.950
we're kind of great.
It was great fight.
Floyd Mayweather schooled him.
Um,

28
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.410
but at the end it said that Conor McGregor,

29
00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:42.020
his face was swollen and bleeding and he was knocked through the ropes.

30
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.490
And uh,
I said,
you can't say that because everybody saw the fight.

31
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.590
That didn't happen in this crazy time where everybody is crying out for fake

32
00:01:51.591 --> 00:01:56.000
news.
You can't say his face was covered in blood when there was no blood.

33
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.320
You can't say that like,
don't do that.
It was it.
Correct.
It,
it was corrected,

34
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.490
which is so rare,

35
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.440
<v 1>but it's actually not like we correct things.
Yes,
all the time.
Right.</v>

36
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.610
But how do you stop it from happening in the first place?
How do you feel?

37
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.590
The first one?
The first one is really hard.
I mean,
it's blood.
No,

38
00:02:11.591 --> 00:02:14.290
no blood when it doesn't exist.
No,
what I'm saying.
Sorry,
what I'm saying?

39
00:02:14.291 --> 00:02:14.921
It's really hard.

40
00:02:14.921 --> 00:02:19.420
What I mean is journalists just shouldn't make mistakes like that,
but we do.

41
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.710
The difference with the New York Times and any number of these other places is

42
00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:28.120
that we say we made a mistake and we correct.
Well,
it's high.
That matters,
right?

43
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.600
Yeah.
It's couple pros.
It's like someone having getting ahead of themselves,

44
00:02:31.601 --> 00:02:33.520
having a little too much fun.
I don't remember that article.

45
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.940
<v 0>Well,
it wasn't,
I don't necessarily think it's getting ahead of fiction.</v>

46
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.700
They applied fiction to an actual sport event,
which I thought was bizarre,
but,

47
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.040
but the correct,
and if they did correct it,
well,
here's what's important.

48
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.960
What's important is you can at least get a better version of the facts there,

49
00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:51.010
then you can anywhere else.

50
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.770
<v 1>Yes,
and I,</v>

51
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.770
I guess there's some people in the new media landscape that I see and I don't

52
00:02:56.861 --> 00:03:01.120
know if it's because they want to sort of gin up their own are what like

53
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.690
nihilistic Lee getting on like using Trumpist language to describe the press.

54
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.600
Would they don't see what they don't know?

55
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.660
I think what they don't understand is that the loss of trust in the press is a

56
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:20.890
symptom of the loss of trust in lots of public institutions.

57
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.300
The WHO,
you know,

58
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:25.480
the World Health Organization just came out with this terrifying report.

59
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.080
We're like one of the top 10 threats to health in,

60
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.450
I think the country you should,
we should look this up,

61
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.240
is people who aren't getting vaccines,

62
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.360
people who think vaccines cause autism and are not getting vaccines.

63
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.740
The stakes of like loss of trust in public institutions.

64
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.060
Does it just mean like you're going to like hurt the New York Times bottom line.

65
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:50.350
It's like a threat to all of our health.
Like quite literally,
you know,

66
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:53.290
I see these things as being very,
very connected.

67
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.060
So when I see people gleefully celebrating like the fake news of the New York

68
00:03:58.061 --> 00:04:03.020
Times,
I'm like Juva better alternative right now.
You know?

69
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.030
That's what I'm thinking.
Not You,
but

70
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.200
<v 0>no.
Yeah,
no,
I agree.
I don't understand why anyone would celebrate that.</v>

71
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.320
Think it falls into what we were talking about before that it's a,

72
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.490
an easily digestible ideology that you can just subscribe to.

73
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.060
It's a conglomeration of preformed opinions and you lock in,

74
00:04:18.061 --> 00:04:21.510
you start saying fake news.
And this is,
and it's also,

75
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.710
it's exacerbated by this situation that we find ourselves in where people aren't

76
00:04:25.711 --> 00:04:29.190
really buying newspapers anymore.
You have to get people to subscribe.

77
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.710
I subscribe to several,
um,

78
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.270
on my phone and on my computer and that's how I digest things now.
Or a,

79
00:04:36.271 --> 00:04:38.070
an IPAD.
When you,

80
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.050
you think about what they have to do to get those clicks,
you know,

81
00:04:43.051 --> 00:04:47.670
and you see these weird,
like I look now,
this is not a knock on Forbes.

82
00:04:47.671 --> 00:04:51.420
I think Forbes is an excellent periodical.
They're great.
They,
they,

83
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.400
they write some really important stuff,

84
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.790
but almost every month they'll write this super click baity thing about cell

85
00:05:00.271 --> 00:05:03.660
phones.
Like it comes with a nasty surprise.

86
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.850
The new galaxy s 10 has a nasty surprise and it's so unimaginative.

87
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:10.590
Yes,
yes.

88
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.760
But to see if he could find how many nasty surprise articles about iPhones and

89
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.590
I've uh,
Ip video game stuff a lot too.

90
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.510
They have like a contributor network that people are just allowed to write

91
00:05:21.511 --> 00:05:23.150
articles on.
Ah,

92
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.940
yeah.

93
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.940
That fucking stuff is so dangerous because as soon as people lose their trust

94
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.470
that you are unbiased and you're giving them an objective perspective on exactly

95
00:05:37.471 --> 00:05:39.270
what's going on.
As soon as,
I mean,

96
00:05:39.271 --> 00:05:42.930
it might be nothing when it comes to galaxy s tens or whatever the fuck they're

97
00:05:42.931 --> 00:05:46.410
talking about.
This has a nasty surprise,
but,
but it,

98
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.160
it flavors your perspective on news.
Of course it does.

99
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.850
And these people are fighting for their life journalists and people in

100
00:05:53.851 --> 00:05:57.410
contributors to these websites and news and newspapers are fighting for life

101
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.490
because everything is dropping off,
the revenues are down,
the revenues are dry.

102
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.710
And then like what's,
what takes their place,
what takes the place bloggers,
who's,

103
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.210
who's looking at them?
Do you share that?

104
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:13.040
They have journalistic ethics and standards that are like what we would expect

105
00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:16.550
from,
they don't,
they know,
right?
They don't have to,

106
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.330
and this brings you to the [inaudible] Info wars thing,
right?
He,

107
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.460
if he's a journalist and he's definitely not a journalist.
Right?
But this is,

108
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.730
but this is what people are fighting about.
This is,

109
00:06:28.731 --> 00:06:31.730
this is the whole Shebang.
Like if,

110
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.110
if some of that news that you're getting in these traditional venues is fake,

111
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.760
it is dangerous.
If any of it is click baity of any of it is deceptive.

112
00:06:41.761 --> 00:06:43.820
Not agree with you more.
It's fucking dangerous.
