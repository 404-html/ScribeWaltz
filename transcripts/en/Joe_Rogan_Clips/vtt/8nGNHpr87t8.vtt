WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.560
I mean,
I would like to know what the number is.
If the church is in this country,

2
00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:07.230
had to pay taxes.
That mean clearly,

3
00:00:07.231 --> 00:00:10.830
especially when you look at the televangelists that are driving rolls Royces and

4
00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:12.300
flying around in private jets.
I mean,

5
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.500
there's profit is extreme amount of profit and it's discretionary income.

6
00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:19.860
They could do whatever they want with it and you're,
you're dealing with massive,

7
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:22.440
massive sums of money and they don't contribute.

8
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.550
So these people are clearly personally benefiting from the contributions of

9
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:30.030
these people.
And then they don't pay taxes on it.
And in the case of like,

10
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:34.200
ministers who live in a church owned home,
they don't have to pay property tax.

11
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.540
Uh,
you know,
there's a lot of hidden benefits there.
It's dirty,
it is dirty.

12
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.490
It's amazing that it's still here.
I mean,

13
00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:44.760
especially when you deal with something like Scientology,
we'll,
you know,

14
00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:47.520
the guy who wrote it,
right?
Like it's,

15
00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:51.020
this is not some ancient texts that were handed down from,
uh,

16
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.040
you know,
the guy and the guy was a terrible writer.
I mean,

17
00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:58.260
he was a terrible science fiction author.

18
00:00:58.261 --> 00:01:01.980
He just wrote every fucking thing he wrote was a first draft.

19
00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:04.350
Just just boom,
gone.
I mean,

20
00:01:04.351 --> 00:01:07.230
it's just the most nonsensical nonsense writing,

21
00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:10.770
and yet they don't have to pay taxes because it's considered a legitimate

22
00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:14.550
religion.
Harless Arlin Ellison,
the great science fiction writer died this year.

23
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.300
Uh,

24
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.780
told me the story of what the famous story where l Ron Hubbard allegedly said,

25
00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:21.990
you know,
I'm going to go start a religion.
He said it was,
it's real.

26
00:01:21.991 --> 00:01:23.130
It's a true story.
They were,

27
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.030
but it was just a bunch of science fiction writers sitting around like this

28
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.610
chatting and complaining about how poorly paid they are.

29
00:01:29.611 --> 00:01:32.610
They have to crank out by the word,
you know,
Kenny a word kind of thing.

30
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.620
And somebody said,
you know,

31
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.800
we should just start a religion and make shit up like that,
and I'll run.

32
00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:40.710
Hubbard goes,
yeah,
you know,
that's a good idea,
I think.
I think I might do that.

33
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:44.790
And then he went out and wrote dianetics and that became the founding document

34
00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:49.200
of Scientology.
Did you watch the,
the HBO series on it?

35
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.740
The documentary rather?
Yeah,
the going clear.
Unbelievable.

36
00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:54.300
That's the best documentary on it.
Of course,

37
00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:59.301
I've seen Aaliyah's show she's got a big guts to go after.

38
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.610
I don't know if she's got good lawyers are a,

39
00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:05.790
and he has good lawyers or whatever.
Maybe they've stopped suing people.

40
00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:09.780
I don't know.
I think the climate has shifted and I think people were more,

41
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:10.381
first of all,

42
00:02:10.381 --> 00:02:13.830
for the longest time all we thought of when you thought about Scientology,

43
00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:18.060
thought about positive thinking and John Travolta and Tom Cruise,

44
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.460
they're all super positive,
you know,

45
00:02:20.461 --> 00:02:24.210
and they're getting things done and there's auditing and they're really taking

46
00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:25.830
care of their mind and you know,

47
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.400
and thinking clearly and eliminating all the negative influences.

48
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.850
But then once I'm,
there was a bunch of factors I think,

49
00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:35.220
but once the Internet opened up these,
the,

50
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.360
the doctrines and you've got a chance to read it and people got a chance to mock

51
00:02:39.361 --> 00:02:42.500
it and then,
you know,
South Park did that whole series on it where they are,

52
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.560
this is what they actually believe.
And you see like when south park did that,

53
00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:48.660
everybody was like,
Holy Shit,
wait a minute,
is that real?

54
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.050
And then people started googling it and then looking into it and then it started

55
00:02:52.051 --> 00:02:55.440
to unravel.
Slowly but surely people started leaving the church,

56
00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:56.700
Lawrence Wright wrote the book,

57
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.670
all these things are happening and now Leah is coming in and Leah was,
you know,

58
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.160
I knew her,
but I mean I'm friends with Kevin James from the king and Queen.
So I,

59
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.940
I've known Leah for 20 plus years and when I first met her,

60
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:14.941
she was just like this hard ass beautiful woman who's just like driven and like,

61
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.890
like she said,
Scientologists were like,
oh,
let's get the fuck out of her way.

62
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.031
You know?
It was like that.

63
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:24.031
She's just like super active and just getting things done and just being

64
00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:26.260
productive.
I mean,

65
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:28.420
that's what you thought about when you thought about Scientology,

66
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.860
but now when you think about it is like nonsense and it's foolishness and,

67
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.900
and once going clear air and you've got to see l Ron Hubbard and listened to him

68
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:42.901
talk and you see the captain's outfit he had on with the metals that he gave

69
00:03:43.331 --> 00:03:46.680
himself.
Like what?
Who would buy this stuff?

70
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.530
It's so dumb.
It's just,
it's amazing that it,

71
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.500
it's so effective and so financially successful.
I,

72
00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:57.670
yeah,
I think their membership roles are pretty low,

73
00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:01.360
but their property holdings I think are pretty substantive.
Yeah.
I mean,

74
00:04:01.361 --> 00:04:05.670
they're the second biggest real estate owner in Los Angeles.
Is that right?
Yeah.

75
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.120
Oh Wow.
At least they were,
there was some,
uh,

76
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.150
Japanese folks that were number one and then it was a number two was
Scientology.

77
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.310
Maybe that's not true anymore.
Might be a oil barons.
Now,
you know,

78
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.250
well back in the 90s,
when the Internet first got cranked up,

79
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.050
we were doing issue is articles on Scientology is when some of these ex members

80
00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:28.330
started posting the secret doctrines,

81
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:32.290
the z news story and the going clear at level eight or whatever.

82
00:04:32.291 --> 00:04:36.130
When you find out the,
the,
the,
the inside story and they got raided,

83
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.130
I mean the Scientologists went to court to court the judges and said,
uh,

84
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.070
this is copyrighted material.
And it's like,
wait,
wait,
your religion,

85
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.390
how can you copyright of religious?
Well,
and they somehow got around that,
I mean,

86
00:04:49.391 --> 00:04:52.060
this would be like the Catholic church not telling you about Jesus.

87
00:04:52.061 --> 00:04:55.900
And the resurrection until level eight after you've paid $100,000 or something

88
00:04:55.901 --> 00:04:59.880
like that.
It's just insane.
Well,
what's amazing is that the IRS caved in terms.

89
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.980
Unbelievable.
When that happened,
I remember when that happened,
I thought,

90
00:05:02.981 --> 00:05:06.220
oh my God,
I don't want to fuck with these guys.
I mean,
they beat the IRS.

91
00:05:06.221 --> 00:05:08.340
I'm a nobody.
How am I going to defend myself again?

92
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.530
But maybe they've stopped suing people.
Maybe they're not going after Leah.

93
00:05:11.531 --> 00:05:16.531
Like la real estate here goes portfolio properties reported at $400 million in

94
00:05:17.891 --> 00:05:19.990
Hollywood alone,
paid for in cash.
No left.

95
00:05:19.991 --> 00:05:24.010
The Church of Scientology is undeniably a formidable player in the real estate

96
00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:26.770
game.
Wow.
That's what you got.

97
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.510
They have some beautiful properties too.
Yeah.
It's just really amazing.

98
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.780
It's amazing.
So you know my,
my skeptic frenzy,
oh,

99
00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:37.450
they're going to go out of business anytime soon.
It's like,
I don't know.

100
00:05:37.451 --> 00:05:39.760
I think they could have practically no members instilled.

101
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.720
They have all this real estate.
Here's the thing,
even though it's nonsense,

102
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.300
just so is most religion,

103
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.650
let's just be honest.
I mean,

104
00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:53.530
if you want to talk about guys coming back from the dead after being burned for

105
00:05:53.531 --> 00:05:54.161
three days,

106
00:05:54.161 --> 00:05:58.100
or Adam and eve being the only two people and they have kids and their kids just

107
00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:00.740
started having sex with each other and that makes all the people in the world,

108
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:04.640
or Moses parting the Red Sea and Jesus walking on water.
I mean,

109
00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:08.630
you're looking at horse shit everywhere.
It's just older horse shit.
It's,

110
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:08.931
you know,

111
00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:12.740
whether or not it's based on some real events or certain real people who knows,

112
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:15.680
who knows?
You know,
but it's all nonsense.

113
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.670
If you ever heard a Julius Sweeney's monologue letting go of God.
Now,

114
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.850
do you know Julia from Saturday night live?
I know who she is.
I do not know her.

115
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.220
Yeah,
she just moved back to La.
So you should have her on the show.

116
00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:27.760
She's terrific love to.
So,
um,

117
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.590
she was born and raised Catholic love being a Catholic,

118
00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:32.270
the whole culture and all that was great.

119
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.230
And then she started reading Dawkins and me and Harrison saw on and then kind of

120
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.500
let all that go.
And then she wrote a monologue.
It's very moving.

121
00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:40.820
So the model like opens,

122
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:46.060
she's in her house in Hollywood and the Mormon boys come by and she invites them

123
00:06:46.521 --> 00:06:49.790
in and they want to tell the story and she's thinking,

124
00:06:49.791 --> 00:06:51.080
this is like a Hollywood pitch story.

125
00:06:51.081 --> 00:06:53.900
You're going to pitch the story and I'll get back to you later until you know

126
00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:57.120
how I like it.
No,
no.
They wanted to,
you know,
to actually,
you know,

127
00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.330
press to see if she could join right then and there.
You know,

128
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.730
they're on their two year mission that they do,
you know,

129
00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:05.000
so picture of these two 18 year olds with their white starched shirts and their

130
00:07:05.001 --> 00:07:08.600
bicycles.
And so Julia starts pressing him a little bit.
So,

131
00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:12.810
so what's the story here?
Well,
see,
this guy,
Joseph Smith,
he,

132
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.940
he found these gold plates in his backyard and he translated to them from

133
00:07:16.941 --> 00:07:17.690
ancient,
uh,

134
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:22.040
hieroglyphics into English and with these magic stones and they're going on.

135
00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:26.120
And then Jesus came to America and there was the good Indians and the bad

136
00:07:26.121 --> 00:07:29.090
Indians at Julie's.
Like,
I just want to tell them,
okay,

137
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.440
don't start with this story.
This is a bad pitch story.
Even the Scientologists,

138
00:07:33.441 --> 00:07:38.270
no,
don't tell him about Xenu until way down the line.
But then she says,

139
00:07:38.271 --> 00:07:39.570
reflecting on it,
you know,
if,

140
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.830
if I told somebody my Catholic story who never heard of it,

141
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:47.410
it would sound just as wacky cause it's virgin and the resurrection.
What?

142
00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:48.890
Yeah.
All of it's wacky.
