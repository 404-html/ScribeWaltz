1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.150
Well,
I hope so.
I mean,
I,
I think,

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.140
I know that there's a stigma attached to mental illness and that really bothers

3
00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:15.690
me.
There should not be,
I mean,
having depression or anxiety or whatever.

4
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.720
To me it should have no more stigma than having a knee injury or kidney

5
00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:24.420
infection or diabetes.

6
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.450
But there is a stigma attached to it and I've tried to talk about this in a way

7
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.340
where it's okay to talk about it and not be ashamed of it.
It's,

8
00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:40.290
it's okay if you've got anxiety,
you've got PTSD,
w whatever.

9
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.810
It's okay,
let's talk about it.
Let's get hell for it.

10
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:45.360
Get it behind you and move on.
I mean,
just not,

11
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.420
it's not something that she should be ashamed of.
What do you,

12
00:00:48.421 --> 00:00:50.880
when you talking to someone that maybe has depression,

13
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.010
do you try to get them to exercise first?

14
00:00:54.011 --> 00:00:58.500
He tried to get them to visit a psychiatrist immediately and get on medication.

15
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.070
Like do you take it on a case by case basis?
Well,
I do,

16
00:01:02.071 --> 00:01:05.610
but you have to approach it.
Everybody has a philosophy about it.

17
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.420
And I'm not saying that mine's any better than anybody else's,

18
00:01:09.421 --> 00:01:14.421
but I do have a philosophy about it and I'm very slow to medication.

19
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.313
I mean,

20
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.520
I think you use medication for biochemical replacement.

21
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.670
I mean,
if for some reason your body is not making enough of something it needs,

22
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.650
then maybe you support it short term biochemically.

23
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.920
But I,

24
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.600
I look at depression,
I,
there's a lot of ways you can break it up,

25
00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:41.400
but I look at it like,

26
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.880
is it exogenous depression or endogenous depression?
I mean,

27
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:48.930
is it coming from the inside out or the outside in?

28
00:01:48.931 --> 00:01:52.680
Is it because you're reacting to something?
I see a lot of depressed people that

29
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.800
in a sense it makes sense,
right?
I mean,
you look at their life and you say,
well,

30
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.080
if you're not down about this,
you should be,
I mean,
you've lost your job.

31
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.610
You've gotten a divorce,
your health is in the shitter.
You're,
I mean,

32
00:02:08.611 --> 00:02:11.910
you should be down about this.
It's external things.

33
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.270
So you don't need a pill.
I mean,

34
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.650
put somebody in a chemical straight jacket because their life's fallen apart.

35
00:02:19.651 --> 00:02:22.100
What the hell's that gonna do then?

36
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.690
That's just putting goggles on him where they can't see it.

37
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.750
I would much rather get them to behave their way to success and say,

38
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.210
what are you reacting to that you're depressed about?

39
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.320
Let's put that on a to do list and start,
like you said,

40
00:02:37.321 --> 00:02:40.440
write it down and start crossing those things off.

41
00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:44.070
Let's figure what's an action plan to change this action plan to change the next

42
00:02:44.071 --> 00:02:47.370
thing actually,
and then when you start doing that,

43
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.310
then you generally see their mood lift.

44
00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:55.311
A lot of people that are depressed or just realistically reacting to a crummy

45
00:02:55.471 --> 00:02:59.800
circumstance in their life,
it's not necessarily a a mental illness.

46
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:04.801
It's just a really realistic reaction to a bad spot in their life.

47
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.070
<v 1>Yeah.
That's such a way,
good way of putting it to that.</v>

48
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.360
You weren't in a bad state looking at this might be something wrong with it.

49
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.290
<v 0>Yeah.
You're in denial.
Yeah.
I mean if,
if,
if you've got a divorce,
lost your job,</v>

50
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.090
your health's in bad shape,

51
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.500
your kids are alienated from you and you're saying,
I'm fine,

52
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.020
then you're not in touch with reality,
then you should be bothered by that.

53
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.890
And I think to give somebody a pill to mask your feelings about that just keeps

54
00:03:36.151 --> 00:03:40.390
you off task.
I don't,
you'll pain's a good motivator.
Um,

55
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.310
you know,

56
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.310
I grew up in Texas and Oklahoma and I don't know you've ever done this,

57
00:03:46.831 --> 00:03:48.000
but we were,

58
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.160
I used to spend my summers in the thriving metropolis of Monday,

59
00:03:53.161 --> 00:03:57.120
Texas.
You ever heard of Monday,
Texas?
No,
it's him.
You in?

60
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.960
It's a u,
not n.
O.
M.
U.
N.
D.
A.
Y.

61
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.360
It's got like 2000 people in it,

62
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.880
but in the summers it would get hot in Monday,
Texas.

63
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:10.620
When I say hot,

64
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.680
I mean you look out in the backyard and your dog burst into flame.

65
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:14.730
This is what I'm talking about.

66
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.340
So we would be going to the swimming pool or something bare footed and you get

67
00:04:20.341 --> 00:04:24.850
halfway across an asphalt road and you look down and you're,

68
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.560
I mean like,
Holy Shit,
me,
your feet are just on fire.

69
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.670
So what are you going to do?
I mean,
that is painful.

70
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.380
You're going to do one of two things.

71
00:04:34.381 --> 00:04:37.860
You're either going to make a u turn and get your ass back over to the side of

72
00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:41.520
the road and getting the grass or you're going to run to the other side and get

73
00:04:41.521 --> 00:04:42.660
off the road and getting the grass.

74
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.160
But you are not going to stand there in the middle of the road and melt yourself

75
00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:50.910
down to the knees.
Pain is a motivator.

76
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.170
Paint is not necessarily always bad.
If you're in pain,

77
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.740
it's going to motivate you to move to change something.

78
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.210
And the mash that with drugs to dull that pain with drugs is not necessarily a

79
00:05:03.211 --> 00:05:04.000
good thing.

80
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.530
<v 1>That is wise,
wise advice and um,
I wish more people thought that way.</v>

81
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.000
Particularly more doctors,
you know,

82
00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:13.030
I have so many friends that have gone to a doctor because I'm not feeling so

83
00:05:13.031 --> 00:05:16.240
good and that they're almost immediately wanting to throw them on something

84
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.660
that's not smart.
And all the years that you've been doing this,

85
00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:24.050
have you noticed like was depression as prevalent like the,

86
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.770
the term depression or was it doesn't,
I mean,

87
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.200
I don't really remember it being a thing when I was a kid that was discussed the

88
00:05:32.201 --> 00:05:33.400
way it's discussed now,

89
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.750
now it's discussed the way people discuss all sorts of other ailments.

90
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.980
Is it just an awareness thing or is it just people were thinking about it now in

91
00:05:41.981 --> 00:05:42.814
different terms?

92
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.010
<v 0>Well,
I think as part of the narrative now,
and I think with social media,</v>

93
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.850
with the Internet,
not just social media,
with the Internet,

94
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.580
I think there's just a lot more,
it's a lot more in the nomenclature.

95
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.510
Um,
and there's a lot more awareness about it.
Um,

96
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.160
but I think it was just as prevalent in the fifties and sixties as it was now.

97
00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:09.161
But in the fifties and sixties there wasn't a psychologist on every corner and

98
00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:14.261
there is now and there wasn't sub doctoral licensing then.

99
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:16.100
I mean,
you,
what does that mean?
Well,

100
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.490
back then that you had to have a phd or an MD as a psychiatrist to see patients.

101
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.450
Now they have marriage and family therapist.
They've licensed social workers,

102
00:06:26.451 --> 00:06:30.470
they have different levels,
uh,
where you can do independent practice.

103
00:06:30.471 --> 00:06:35.471
So that's broadened the number of people that can provide services.

104
00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:40.150
And some people think that's a good thing.
Some people think it's not.
Um,

105
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:41.760
I generally think it's a,

106
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.990
it's a good thing because I think [inaudible] 58% of our rural markets today

107
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.760
have no psychiatrist available and something like 50 or roughly have no mental

108
00:06:59.301 --> 00:07:02.270
health professional available at all.
None.

109
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.470
So there's just nobody available to help people in,

110
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.090
in the outlying areas.

111
00:07:08.091 --> 00:07:11.870
So I think the more people you can get into the profession,

112
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.670
so long as there's a degree of competency is better.
But,
you know,

113
00:07:16.671 --> 00:07:18.140
I think it's always been prevalent.

114
00:07:18.141 --> 00:07:19.970
I just think people didn't talk about it very much.

115
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.750
It's just something I swallowed or they took the church or,
yeah.
Yeah.
