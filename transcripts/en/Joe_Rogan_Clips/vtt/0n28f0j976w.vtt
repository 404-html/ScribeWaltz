00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:01.260
Lady gentleman,

2
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.980
black helicopters have been spotted your podcasts with your wife's one of my

3
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:08.710
favorite podcasts.
It's so fucking consistently silly thing.

4
00:00:08.711 --> 00:00:13.490
It is very so ridiculous and people get silly when they get on it and they do.

5
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.740
And then you know,
I start like seeing things like,

6
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.890
oh this is like a your mom's house bit.
I need to send it to Tom.
Yeah,

7
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.180
you sent me a couple of good ones.

8
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.310
I can't tell a story about taking this shit without 90 people hitting me up the

9
00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:29.280
next day telling me that was the most brilliant story in the world we want to

10
00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:33.810
send at the ago.
And I tell him,
I tell her shit,
no shit comic.

11
00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:38.550
It's awesome.
Myself.
I'm two days later.
It sure it up.

12
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.660
I'm wearing the fucking youtube video.
That's true.

13
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.910
Play Joey telling shit stories for sure.
And he told us about money shit,
uh,

14
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.970
in his backyard and somebody thought it was a barren.

15
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.903
She would leave,

16
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.320
she would let her dogs out every day and then she would clean up.

17
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.320
They will French poodles.
Yeah.

18
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.990
Which is really back from the shit.
This shit.

19
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.721
Joe Rogan,

20
00:01:10.721 --> 00:01:15.721
she looked at it and she was like 58 so she's squinting at this up against the

21
00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:20.520
wall.
But here's what I took a shit and I put my back against the wall.

22
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.930
So when I shift,
when you shit outside,
it's not going to be a decent shit.

23
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.610
It's going to be like explosive.

24
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.690
So when I got up and it looks like somebody got shot in the head that we should

25
00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:34.530
all behind me.
So she's sitting there with a little French poodles,

26
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.880
I little Chihuahuas and she's looking at the wall like,
what the fuck happened?

27
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:43.881
Then all of a sudden she actually walks up close to it and squints and looks and

28
00:01:45.061 --> 00:01:49.050
looks around and runs in the house.
I'm watching all this,
I can't breathe.

29
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.000
And now I go to the computer cause my wife's very decent sitting there forever.

30
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.670
And then my wife comes in,
she goes,
where are you home all day today?
I go,
yeah,

31
00:01:59.671 --> 00:02:01.830
why?
She goes,
I just had a conversation with Susan.

32
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.260
She wanted to know if you heard anything in the backyard,

33
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.950
cause some animals to be shit back then I went,

34
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.690
I want to get Sushi but give it a go get Sushi.
I eat a lot of it.

35
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.220
The rice pushes everything I asked and you had a plan is to go give it a weed

36
00:02:20.221 --> 00:02:23.940
store.
You want to go to post office.
But I made a detour.
I plan to go home,

37
00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:27.480
but I left the house key in the house so I had to climb around the window.

38
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.120
That's what happened.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So when I pulled myself up,

39
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.040
I actually landed with my stomach on the window and that you're really,

40
00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:40.041
which made it push it out more and I'm saddened and fuck and my hands are

41
00:02:40.171 --> 00:02:43.650
struggling in the window or on the other side.

42
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.180
And the cat said meow and I'd be scratching at me,
right.
And I'm like,

43
00:02:47.181 --> 00:02:51.990
it's me your fuck.
So I ran out,
ran down the stairs.

44
00:02:51.991 --> 00:02:56.370
I was shit outside.
Oh my God,
this was the amount.

45
00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.670
I took a shit in favor in his backyard after a five hour drive from Colton or

46
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:02.680
some weird town.
Did he not talk to you after that?

47
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:07.470
For Awhile I took a shit and then he ran over it with his car and the whole back

48
00:03:07.471 --> 00:03:11.860
yard smells like sewage.
I'd go with her the next day he goes,

49
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.200
it smells back here.
Let's talk in the house.

50
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.010
I don't know what happened and you can see that Brown shit.

51
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.250
You smushed it with this tire and a bunch of fly to

52
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.580
talk to me for a month after that in some of these backyard

53
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.370
because I told him the truth.
I felt bad for the guy.

54
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.950
That's hard to clean up too.
Yeah.
Shit.
You can see up dog shit.

55
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.700
It doesn't even make you gag like human shit bomb shit to clean up some wine.

56
00:03:45.701 --> 00:03:49.810
Oh Shit.
If yet.
He's one of those scrapers.
It smells so much stronger man.

57
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.640
It's so much.
No,
no,
no.
When you take a shit til you cut it in half,

58
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.800
cut the shit when that,

59
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.130
when that Reese's peanut butter perfume leaks out.
Oh my God.

60
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.550
I've done studies.
When you're going to jail,

61
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.900
when you go to prison,
you have to cut the shit.
The shit like in the two.

62
00:04:11.901 --> 00:04:15.790
But people watching TV,
like when you go to county jail,
you shit right there.

63
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.590
So black guys,

64
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:21.640
we'll be laying there watching TV with their feet up and also that small little

65
00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:24.580
shit in there like put some water in that whole motherfucker.

66
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.820
Like they'll just yell it cause the other side of the fucking prison.
What's it?

67
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.410
Cause that means you,
you took a shit and just sitting there.
So in prison,

68
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.460
as soon as your shit,
you got to put water on it.
Yeah.

69
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.300
But then some bathrooms that only give you 20 ounces of water a day.

70
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.250
So whatever time you flush,
it's gotta be a good flush.
You're following me.

71
00:04:45.251 --> 00:04:46.270
So you pick a pitch.

72
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.830
Sometimes a piss has to stay there until the next day until you take a good good

73
00:04:50.831 --> 00:04:53.740
shit.
But when you take a shit in jail,
bro,
that's what they'll tell you.

74
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.560
Cause some water.
But some hole in that motherfucking old dog,

75
00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.620
I could smell that shit.
Right now I'm trying to watch Oprah,

76
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.810
but that's what smells one stuff sucks.

77
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.380
It's like when you go to Vegas to have that sucking action will,

78
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.910
if you take a shit this big that's 34 inches,

79
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.770
once that thing it breaks and it looks like two new chucks.
Once that breaks,

80
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.980
it's over,
it's over.
And they put the bathroom right by the door,

81
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.620
the front entrance.
You can't have nobody come over.
Right.
Right.

82
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.750
That's why I always go downstairs to take shit.

83
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.050
I don't Shit my bathroom in the hotel no more cause it kills the whole room for

84
00:05:26.051 --> 00:05:30.580
two hours.
We worked at the House of Blues and Vegas and uh,
Joey left,
uh,

85
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.930
an onshore shit.
You know what an onshore shit is.
He,

86
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.970
he was so fat at the time that he couldn't sit down and like the regular toilet.

87
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.170
You were like,
what were you wanting to do this for?
15,
he was dying.
He was giant.

88
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.700
So when he would take his shit,

89
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:50.730
he would had have to balance himself mostly on the very edge of the front

90
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.740
because his ass was so big.
Why and Shit in the water out on the deck.

91
00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.190
No.
Oh,

92
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.520
you ain't never seen shit like that before.
So you couldn't sit in the toilet.

93
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.640
I would fill in the toilet,
but I don't like,
my logo was on the edge.

94
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:10.940
It wasn't that I was fat.
I don't like my dick inside the toilet.
Right.

95
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.320
He's gonna suck his Dick and Austin.
They're stuck in the toilet.
I tell my wife,

96
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.750
I don't even let my wife pee in public because I want to eat her monkey.

97
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:22.100
I don't want that monkey touching me.
So when I shit in a public bathroom,

98
00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:25.070
I hope my balls and I shit towards the edge.

99
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:26.900
I don't give a fuck at somebody else's backroom.

100
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.960
Just hold your balls and sit where you are because none of them you to move

101
00:06:32.961 --> 00:06:34.430
forward.
Because if I'm back there,

102
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.550
I got crabs one time I left that sitting on the toilet.

103
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.290
They'll jump from that toilet inward like they jumping over a month.

104
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.510
People saying they got crabs to the toilet as an excuse.

105
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.820
Sometimes you could Greg crabs from anywhere.

106
00:06:46.821 --> 00:06:49.400
But why you think you to get it from him?
They only cleaned the hairs.

107
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:53.030
I don't think they like little stay on an actual toilet.
Probably.
Definitely.

108
00:06:53.031 --> 00:06:55.850
Right.
Yeah.
I wouldn't feel like that's one of the things like black crabs.

109
00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.140
I took a shirt at the gas station that had to be at,
that's what Ivan's figured.

110
00:07:00.141 --> 00:07:02.360
It was not,
I'm sorry.
I always hold my nuts.

111
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.010
Shit when I shit it was long and red band put ketchup on it.

112
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.150
Remember red band put ketchup on it.
Unfortunately,

113
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:15.680
I think that was a different time.
Okay.
This is not happening just for us.

114
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.010
It's been many,
many times things just like sticking out.
So you go in there,

115
00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:22.790
there's a smell.
You know how when you take an epic shit,

116
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.980
it's an above watershed.
It comes out like,

117
00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:29.420
like the fucking big island of Hawaii just rises through the water.

118
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:34.010
Like I've done that many times where because I eat too much and I'll take these

119
00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:36.920
shits that are just like so big.
They're preposterous,

120
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:41.050
but there's a totally different smell to those shifts cause you're smelling raw

121
00:07:41.051 --> 00:07:43.520
shit outside of the water.
I mean it's,
it's,

122
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.150
it's gone through the water and it's poking into the strong.

123
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.450
What is it about that that makes you happy?

124
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.750
What is it about the sense of accomplishment?
First of all.
Good one right here.

125
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:59.750
It doesn't come around that often either.
No.
Yeah,
man.

126
00:07:59.751 --> 00:08:02.720
It's like a comment like I don't eat.
This doesn't happen all the time.

127
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:06.330
It's always diarrhea too.
It's never like,
it's never like a super,

128
00:08:06.331 --> 00:08:10.100
it's like thick law.
It's weird when the second wave is diarrhea,

129
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.360
like when you take long and you're proud of yourself and then you're like,

130
00:08:14.361 --> 00:08:17.330
I think I got a little more in there and it's like,
ah.
It's just the fucking,

131
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.410
you know what that's from what?
Healthy eating.
Healthy eating does that.
Yeah.

132
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:24.980
If you eat some MCT oil or coconut oils and lubes up your pipes,

133
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:29.000
because where I moved to now I have the office,
the back office,

134
00:08:29.001 --> 00:08:30.770
and it's connected to a bathroom.
It's got a door,

135
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.610
so I don't live with this stick no more.
I opened the door in the morning.

136
00:08:34.611 --> 00:08:37.340
I was living with a stick in the back yard.
I Shit,

137
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.130
I smoked a bowl of shit backyard anymore.
No,
no,
no.

138
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:44.540
My dog goes faces to the back yard dog.
I had my own bathroom and the bedroom.

139
00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:49.020
Then one of them.
That's what I want to put a woman.
No,

140
00:08:49.021 --> 00:08:53.030
I got back there.
Yeah.
Leave her alone.
Open the back door.

141
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.950
Fuck the fuck fan.
I just open the back door.

142
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.940
There's the school behind that kid's playing.
I'm shitting smoking dope.

143
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.020
I don't give a freshman as fuck and I don't smell it.
Then I'm like,

144
00:09:03.021 --> 00:09:05.460
why the candle?
That's beautiful.
Beautiful.

145
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.600
That's what you need is a bathroom with a door that faces outside.

146
00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.720
The worst is when you go over a girl's house and he'd go to use your bathroom

147
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.940
and you smell matches.
Oh yeah.
Oh No,
she was lightless motherfucker up.

148
00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:23.160
Yeah.
It's all you're thinking about burning off fumes.

149
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.110
The Stinky Butt.
I hate packing about her math.

150
00:09:27.111 --> 00:09:30.420
You ever get to a girl's place and then you feel the gurgles and you're like,

151
00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:34.110
that's not good.
I've had that before.

152
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:38.760
I was dating a girl once and she had a ferocious diarrhea.
Ferocious.

153
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:42.110
So she was in one time and she,

154
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:46.860
so she went to the bathroom and she just turned on the shower and she turns on

155
00:09:46.861 --> 00:09:51.450
both things on the sink.
Whoa.
Yeah.
And just she tried to drown it out,

156
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
call it.
I'm like,
what the fuck is going on?
I was very young at the time.

157
00:09:55.001 --> 00:09:57.360
We didn't understand what,
I was super confused.

158
00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.010
What the fuck is going on in there.
I had,
I had once in,

159
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.350
in college where I was at this girl's place and she was just like,
okay,

160
00:10:04.351 --> 00:10:07.110
it's game on.
Like go for it.
Right?
It's like I have to take,

161
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.860
I could feel that it was a diarrhea,
nothing explosive diarrhea,
Shit.

162
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.520
And I also realized there was no way to do it that,

163
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.150
that it would just be a black toilet and that there's no way I could cover.

164
00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.900
She know what I did.
I went back to my place.
I was like,
I'll,
uh,

165
00:10:21.901 --> 00:10:25.350
I'll see you some other time or whatever.
And the next day her friends were like,

166
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:26.280
you're like the fucking,

167
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:30.810
like they gave me credit that they think that I was a good cause they were like,

168
00:10:30.811 --> 00:10:32.650
you're awesome.
And I was like,
no,
I have to take,

169
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.050
because they're not getting fucked and they don't want their friend to get

170
00:10:37.051 --> 00:10:40.200
fucked.
Right.
So they use reverse psychology on you.
You're an amazing guy.

171
00:10:40.201 --> 00:10:44.670
I got an amazing guy.
Credit.
Hope you wait forever.
A circle that you left.

172
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.310
Even when you get married.
Tell her we get married

173
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:52.670
and have sex after you're married.
Never.
That's not about that,
right?

174
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.860
It's about real live.
Well,

175
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.810
if I had had bowels that were intact,

176
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.250
it would have been a different story that night.
But the house bowels,
oh yeah.

177
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:02.670
Yeah.

178
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:07.380
There's a time when you know that it's and the sensitivity of your inner asshole

179
00:11:07.381 --> 00:11:12.150
region.
It is.
It knows,
especially when you go to seep out of Fart,
right?

180
00:11:12.151 --> 00:11:12.611
When you're like,

181
00:11:12.611 --> 00:11:16.110
you're like about to cut a fart and then also the alarms start going off.

182
00:11:16.111 --> 00:11:20.160
You're like,
oh no.
Oh Yeah,
oh no.
And you've got a clamp shot.
Like,
Ooh,
Jesus.

183
00:11:20.161 --> 00:11:20.880
What is this?

184
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:24.150
We were having this debate yesterday about why are they sometimes hot,

185
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.580
like why is it hot and then why does,

186
00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:30.150
why do you know that hot going to smell bad spicy food bro?
Is it,

187
00:11:30.151 --> 00:11:33.700
but is that what it is solely?
I don't know.

188
00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.500
I was telling you guys at one time my freshman year,

189
00:11:36.501 --> 00:11:38.060
I didn't pick a shift for a week and a half.

190
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.410
I was with Dick at this fake comes with American cheese and all right or fries.

191
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.990
How long is that?
This is a long time.
I was in,

192
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:53.100
I played freshman ball and we were playing Paddison east side.

193
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.920
It's just a jungle of a school.
Like you gotta be careful when you go in there

194
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:03.360
and uh,
we went there to play the Christmas tournament.
Well,

195
00:12:03.361 --> 00:12:05.560
what kind of ball are we talking about?
Basketball.

196
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:09.520
I hadn't taken this shift from like 10 days or something.
I took acid,

197
00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:13.690
something fuck my stomach about it until nobody in those days I was really

198
00:12:13.691 --> 00:12:17.160
scared of doctors and I wouldn't say shit to nobody.
No Way.

199
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:21.970
Home we got on the bus
and while we were waiting there,

200
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:25.600
my stomach started hurting and I said,
Jesus Christ,

201
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.800
I don't know if I'm going to shoot myself a Fart,
but let me just take a chance.

202
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:34.720
And I blew this far.
Joe Rogan,
that was so bad.

203
00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.950
We want a bus.
And people started running,
you know,
the school buses.

204
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:43.690
People started running to the windows,
right.
To swing down the bus windows.

205
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:48.330
But here's where it gets better.
I farther again,
I,
the teachers would go,

206
00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.080
oh my God,
he's changing flavors.
Yeah.

207
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:56.940
What's the worst thing was the cheerleaders are crying.

208
00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.200
That's how bad bus

209
00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:07.400
or
the teachers yell.
Dot.
God He's changing.

210
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.470
That's how bad these parts will.

211
00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:17.980
The whole bus forget looking at the cheerleaders.
And they were like,

212
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:22.930
Oh my God,
we've never smelled like this.
But if I was fucking God awful,

213
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:27.640
I wrote a blog about one to Joyce fart.
Is that on a plane?
They got rid of that.

214
00:13:27.641 --> 00:13:30.540
It's called happy pills.
And it was,
I was thinking about,
I was,

215
00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:33.080
I was looking at this ad,
take this,

216
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:37.230
I was looking at this ad for antidepressant.
My God,
you know,

217
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.840
some girl dancing around a field of wheat and shit.
You know those stills ads.

218
00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.950
Yeah.
And uh,
I was just thinking about like,
like what,
you know,

219
00:13:44.951 --> 00:13:48.520
what depresses people and how crazy pills are and how Craig,
oh,

220
00:13:48.521 --> 00:13:52.900
it's still up there.
You can still find it anyway.
Anyway,
at the end of this,

221
00:13:52.901 --> 00:13:56.860
this is a really like me.
We're both,
both of us are barbecued.

222
00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.140
I don't know what the fuck.
What do we add?
A bowl?

223
00:13:59.141 --> 00:14:02.840
Some sort of edibles in the beginning lollipops way they'd be giving.

224
00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:07.480
The boys were crucified.
Rogan was asleep.
Yeah,
he was going in and out,

225
00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:12.340
but he wrote on the blog,
and I don't even have to look at the farm was strong.

226
00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:13.301
He's lucky.

227
00:14:13.301 --> 00:14:17.350
I farted it because it was a lot better than the Antonio Banderas movie.

228
00:14:17.351 --> 00:14:20.920
He was watching something to do's on Antonio Banderas moving in.

229
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:25.150
I don't remember what it was,
what it was,
but I do remember the lady behind you.

230
00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:29.950
I will never forget hearing her over the earphones.
Yeah,
I hear.
Yeah.

231
00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.820
Oh my God.

232
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:41.450
Over the pounding sound in my iPod.
I hear a woman in the row behind us cry out.

233
00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:45.200
Oh my God.
[inaudible] Joey and he smiles.

234
00:14:45.201 --> 00:14:48.110
There's your fucking happy pill right there.
That's your right Antonio.

235
00:14:48.111 --> 00:14:52.480
Banderas it says,
oh,
what was it?
Oh yeah,

236
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.150
teaching underprivileged youth.
How to salsa.
Oh,
that's what I was watching.

237
00:14:56.151 --> 00:15:00.190
I was watching a terrible movie.
Terrible.
We both were,
and Joey farted,

238
00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:03.470
the fart evolve man.
Do you remember by the way,

239
00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:07.640
you walk the seat back to those parts,
will you actually feel your leg?

240
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:12.530
It's like you're in when you were in a plane and it's going to go down.

241
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:17.560
What's the button you push the throat and it was just to a little bit.

242
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:21.080
He blames his seat belt into your waist.
My God,
it was terrible.

243
00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:23.640
But another time I fought,
I used to,

244
00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.320
I used to take the number one bus from Jersey City at all Bergen for the high

245
00:15:27.321 --> 00:15:31.970
school and we were on the bus one morning kids and there was a guy reading a

246
00:15:31.971 --> 00:15:32.804
paper.

247
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:37.040
I could live to be a hundred and never forget this reading the Daily News.

248
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:42.640
And he had a connector of drool from his Lyft to the daily news and there was a

249
00:15:42.921 --> 00:15:44.540
puddle.
He was on heroin.

250
00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.930
They would go to Jersey City in those days and get methadone.

251
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.720
So they would take the bus up north with her.
So I'm sitting there,

252
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:55.340
he's passed the fuck out and the drool is connected to the daily news and

253
00:15:55.341 --> 00:15:57.780
there's got to be just six inches of power.

254
00:15:57.781 --> 00:15:59.960
This guy's been passed out for 20 minutes.

255
00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:05.420
I point my aunt's at them,
I'm not sitting behind them,

256
00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:08.090
I'm sitting across from them and I lift up.

257
00:16:08.091 --> 00:16:11.360
My hips are a little bit just like kept my ass hoe.

258
00:16:11.361 --> 00:16:14.400
Just pointing out that even if it wasn't pointed at them,

259
00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:18.080
it would ricochet off the chair and go straight and through his mouth.

260
00:16:18.081 --> 00:16:22.250
Like he's sitting there and I let her fuck go out.

261
00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:27.190
I could live to be 80 he lifted his eyes like this person,

262
00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:32.930
like he went like this first like hey once his mouth and he's like,
man,

263
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:34.123
who the fuck?

264
00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.260
He goes,
it's about

265
00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.290
died and me and my little buddies were like,

266
00:16:45.291 --> 00:16:49.790
what the fuck and giggling and he's like,

267
00:16:49.791 --> 00:16:54.560
I should beat the fuck out of whatever the father,
I'm just,
oh my God,

268
00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.620
fantastic.
Jesus.

269
00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:08.010
Oh man,
this is what,

270
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:09.470
this is why I hate people.

271
00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:12.410
This is why I hate when I read post to give me a second.

272
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:18.110
This is the reason why I read posts from people going,

273
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:22.750
are you sick of nine was blue comedy will come down to the standard fee in

274
00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:27.370
Friday night and listened to intelligent comedy comp,
fuck,

275
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.850
fuck provoking comedy.
And then I think about it,

276
00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:35.630
how many times I'm 54 years old and at night I got a sleep apnea machine and

277
00:17:35.631 --> 00:17:39.220
there's a little needle in the sleep apnea machine because the hall was punches

278
00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.880
air into your fucking mouth.

279
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:44.090
So there's an escape valve that's the size of a needle.
