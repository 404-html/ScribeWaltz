1
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.920
The joe rogan experience,
the wonder woman one.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.550
You know what drives me crazy,
but all this wonder woman shit,

3
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.370
it's men who get upset at wonder woman.

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.030
It's the same thing that drives me crazy about this black panther movie.

5
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.110
What drives me crazy about this black panther movie is people getting upset

6
00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:23.460
about this Black Panther movie,
but on both sides,
first of all,

7
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.450
white people making a big deal.
I like,
oh great,
oh,

8
00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:30.150
it's all black people like,
well,
it shouldn't just be all good people.

9
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:35.151
Like of course this is the way the story was and this is the way they want to

10
00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:39.390
promote it.
Why do you care?
Like it doesn't,
I don't care.

11
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.310
But then it goes the other way and I do care where I've seen crazy liberal

12
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:47.430
psychos and there were white people in fact saying,

13
00:00:47.431 --> 00:00:51.720
white people stay the fuck out of the theater while uh,

14
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.120
this a while Black Panther is out,

15
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.310
don't steal their joy with your white privilege.
Oh my God,

16
00:00:59.311 --> 00:01:03.840
I literally saw it.
Something along those lines.
I saw a couple of those,

17
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.700
one of them where a woman was asking when it was appropriate to see it.

18
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.930
She and she didn't,
she didn't want to ruin it with her whiteness.

19
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.740
She was totally serious,
totally serious.

20
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.650
And those people were real people and they think that that's,
that makes sense.

21
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.710
Like God dammit.
When,
when shaft was out,

22
00:01:23.711 --> 00:01:27.140
do you think white people couldn't go see shaft when blade came out in

23
00:01:27.141 --> 00:01:29.590
[inaudible] 98 did white people stay home?
Like what are we doing?

24
00:01:29.591 --> 00:01:33.760
Are we more divided now than we ever were before?
We so silly that you can't,

25
00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:37.930
I want to go see Black Panther cause I like fucking superhero movies and it

26
00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:42.730
looks cool.
The fact that anybody would give a shit one way or the other.

27
00:01:42.731 --> 00:01:45.430
I guess if you're a black kid or a black guy who was like,

28
00:01:45.431 --> 00:01:49.210
hey this gives all of us hope that there's more opportunity for movies to be

29
00:01:49.211 --> 00:01:49.721
made like that,

30
00:01:49.721 --> 00:01:53.560
that people aren't really racist and they can embrace a black superhero the same

31
00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:55.360
way they can embrace the Hawk or Thor.

32
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.630
If the movie's really good and I hope the movie is really good and I hope that's

33
00:01:58.631 --> 00:01:59.650
exactly what happens.

34
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.550
But how the fuck did it change so much from one blade was around cause when

35
00:02:03.551 --> 00:02:04.540
blade was around,
dude,

36
00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:07.810
nobody even thought about the fact that it was a black superhero movie.

37
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.460
I mean I guess some people did,

38
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.550
but the emphasis with the fact that Wesley fucking snipes was blade and it

39
00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:19.480
looked good and he was doing karate and chop and vampires up with swords and

40
00:02:19.481 --> 00:02:23.350
shit.
It was a fucking bad ass movie.
That movie was super successful.

41
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.100
They did two sequels.
So like what's changed?

42
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.050
How the fuck is it changed from then until now?
Why is now,
why is it a big deer?

43
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.430
If there's a black superhero,

44
00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.110
but it wasn't a big deal then like are we deteriorating or is it just more noise

45
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.550
because of social media?

46
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.120
Do you get a more distorted sense of how the country actually feels?

47
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.330
Because the people that are more inclined to chime in regularly and vehemently

48
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.430
are oftentimes not the ones who are calculated.
You know,
assessing thinkers,

49
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.900
they're maybe a little bit more aggressive shooting off the,

50
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.320
so what you're getting is not an accurate representation of how people feel,

51
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:04.540
but then you start defending it as if it is accurate.

52
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.450
And so then people start telling white people to stay the fuck home.

53
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.100
Now you've got craziness and you've got craziness because of the fringe,

54
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.460
the fringe on both sides,
but in the middle.
Most people like,

55
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.440
I hope it's a cool movie.
Yeah.
Uh,

56
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:20.530
could you imagine if you had a friend and you were going to,

57
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.990
you want to go see a,
that Black Panther movie?
Nah Man.

58
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:26.200
Fucking these uppity black dudes just really getting into this movie too much.

59
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.930
You'd be like,
what you would,

60
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.690
you would immediately stop hanging out with that guy and you'd probably tell all

61
00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:35.170
of us,
he'd be like,
you won't know what that fucking guy said.
And we'd be like,

62
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:39.190
what the call?
You know,

63
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.070
all that stuff is disgusting.
All of it's disgusting.

64
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.690
It's disgusting on both sides.

65
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.010
It's like anytime you're prejudice against white people or even d critical about

66
00:03:50.011 --> 00:03:53.010
yourself being white,
that you should stay the fuck away from places.

67
00:03:53.011 --> 00:03:57.630
That is crazy.
Not talking about intruding on cultural rituals.

68
00:03:57.631 --> 00:04:00.580
We're talking about an awesome movie.
Everybody who can buy tickets,

69
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.790
you buy a ticket,
it will make the movie more successful.

70
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.470
You want giant opening weekends.

71
00:04:04.471 --> 00:04:08.010
If you really loved this movie and you want movies like this to be successful,

72
00:04:08.011 --> 00:04:10.980
you should be promoting it for everybody.
Why people?
Black people,

73
00:04:10.981 --> 00:04:13.980
Asian people who gives a fuck cause see the superhero movie?

74
00:04:13.981 --> 00:04:15.950
It's going to be fun.
He's got a pendant.

75
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.650
It turns into a fucking bulletproof outfit and he fucks people up.
You shoot him,

76
00:04:19.651 --> 00:04:23.890
he gets more powerful.
It's fun.
Go Watch.
Like who gives a shit?
If it's,

77
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.210
I get the people that take pride in it,

78
00:04:27.211 --> 00:04:29.550
they feel like something's happening for them that it's a black guy,

79
00:04:29.551 --> 00:04:32.040
but the people that are white than have an issue with it.
Oh my God,

80
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.670
you've got to let some shit go.
You just gotta let the noise go by.

81
00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:38.040
Don't let it bounce around inside your head and come up with a year,

82
00:04:38.041 --> 00:04:40.970
but I'm not ruthless.
Why do I have to good shoved in my face and

83
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.720
everybody's got to meet in the middle.
It's a crazy time.

84
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.800
Everybody's got to meet in the middle.

85
00:04:46.801 --> 00:04:51.801
There's way less tension and a conflict then as being verbalized.

86
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.431
That's what I think.

87
00:04:53.431 --> 00:04:58.170
I think if people just realize that a lot of the shit that we're clean too has

88
00:04:58.171 --> 00:05:03.060
just some ways we've been thinking and behaving for a long time and then we can

89
00:05:03.061 --> 00:05:05.640
all just fucking communicate with each other just a little bit better.

90
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.770
I just don't think,
I don't think that racism has gotten worse.

91
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.620
I think it absolutely has gotten worse in some places.

92
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.760
I think there's places where racism exists.
And I think those,

93
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.480
I think when you have young kids that are raised with racism and family members

94
00:05:22.481 --> 00:05:25.030
that are raised at racism and a community that embraces racism,

95
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.280
which has existed in the past,
you know,

96
00:05:27.281 --> 00:05:28.630
and we don't even have to talk about today,

97
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.440
but in the past it was most certainly really racist neighbor at the tally

98
00:05:32.441 --> 00:05:35.170
neighborhoods in New York where black people moved in,

99
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:38.140
they were treated terribly and horrible shit happened a lot of times they

100
00:05:38.141 --> 00:05:40.000
weren't even allowed to move in,
in the first place.

101
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.450
And there's always been stuff like that.
Um,

102
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.490
so if there's always been stuff like that,

103
00:05:45.491 --> 00:05:48.100
it's a natural human inclination that we have to iron out.

104
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.060
We can't just eliminate it by making it illegal or eliminate it by prosecuting

105
00:05:52.061 --> 00:05:56.290
people.
We have to figure out why people think like that to scary way to think.

106
00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.250
Scary to that.
Any one speed.
Look,
first of all,
all of us,

107
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.000
all of us,

108
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and almost anyone listening to this in comparison to someone like Elon Musk is

109
00:06:08.511 --> 00:06:12.970
basically a chimp.
Okay,
so you want to be racist.

110
00:06:12.971 --> 00:06:15.800
You should be racist about against this African guy that's smarter than

111
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:20.480
everybody.
Like what do you,
that's a real African guy from South Africa.

112
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.290
Ilan mosque.
Yes.
Wow.
Yeah.
Um,

113
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.460
he's a real African American.
Yeah.
Like legitimately,

114
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.460
but obviously there's different sheen,
black,

115
00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:35.090
African and I believe it was the Dutch that originally settled that area,

116
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.150
you know,
and that's,
he's the descendants of those people.

117
00:06:38.151 --> 00:06:42.830
But my point is like we're all dumb asses compared to that guy.

118
00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:45.890
So it's top kit and I'll uppity about why people,
you know,

119
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.940
have a better GPA is and whatever other race you're comparing us to cause your

120
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:54.590
stupid yeah.
Compared to that one African dude.

121
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.460
Like you're dumb for sure.
For sure.
Like there's no way you're,

122
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.380
your vote should count more than his.
Yeah.
Right.

123
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:07.760
Mine personally are most anybody's years,
personally,
I don't know.

124
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.440
This idea that there's one race is better than the other races.
Fucking stupid.

125
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.290
The people that are really clinging to it usually don't have shit going on.

126
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.990
Other than that.
That's the problem with racism.

127
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.380
It puts people in a camp of winters when they really don't have to do shit to

128
00:07:21.381 --> 00:07:26.300
get into it.
Get into the team,
you know,
the entrance is instantaneous.

129
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.650
You just,
Oh,
you're white,
you're in.
You know,
that's ridiculous.

130
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.370
That's a ridiculous team.
That's the problem.

131
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.200
That's one of the main problems with re with the ridiculous nature of racism,

132
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:40.670
especially organized racism,

133
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.720
that you just got to take everybody that looks like you.
That's it.
That's all.

134
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.560
Not,
not how they think.
Not what they've read.
Not the life experiences,

135
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:50.390
not how you feel when you're hanging around with them.

136
00:07:50.391 --> 00:07:52.430
Not how they make you laugh.
No.

137
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.060
You want to make sure that they have blood from a certain patch of dirt.

138
00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:01.100
Yeah.
That's crazy.
It's so stupid.

139
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.070
And they moved the goalpost too,
cause I'm a white guy now.

140
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:08.780
But when my grandparents came here,
they were dirty guineas.
Yeah.
You know,

141
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.950
they were,
um,
they were thought of the way a lot of people think about Mexicans,

142
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:17.450
you know,
same kind of thing.
No,
that's changed now.

143
00:08:17.451 --> 00:08:20.390
The Italians are full on white.
Yup.
Totally.

144
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.950
They almost lost our distinction with Jersey shore.
We almost lost it.
