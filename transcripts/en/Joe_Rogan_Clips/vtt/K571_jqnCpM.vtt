1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.440
What has been the one thing that came up that was perhaps the most
controversial?

2
00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:09.441
Like I know my friend Sam Harris was trying to get you guys to ban Donald Trump.

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.170
He was saying if the fall,
your terms of service,
I just did a podcast with him.

4
00:00:13.171 --> 00:00:17.360
Actually you should come out today or tomorrow.
He's uh,
he's a,

5
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.460
he's a fascinating guy.
Sam Harris.
I love him to death.

6
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.140
But what he was trying to do was like saying,
hey,
he's threatening nuclear war.

7
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.280
Like he's saying,
Hey Korea,
my bombs are bigger than your bombs.

8
00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:32.590
Like what else does the guy have to do to get your,

9
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.410
to remove them from the platform?
When you guys saw that,
what,

10
00:00:35.411 --> 00:00:36.810
what was your reaction to that?

11
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.550
Was there an internal discussion about actually banning the president of United

12
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:41.790
States?

13
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.150
<v 1>Well,
so,
so two things there.
One,</v>

14
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.840
it was a context that presidents of this country have you similar language in

15
00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:56.250
different mediums.
They use it on radio,

16
00:00:56.251 --> 00:01:00.030
they use it on television.
It's not just through Twitter.

17
00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:03.840
And even if you were looked at,
you were to look at the presidency of Obama.

18
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.370
It wasn't exactly the same tone in this exact same language,

19
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.580
but there were threats around the same country.

20
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.060
And we have to take that context into consideration.

21
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.780
So the second thing is that we need them.

22
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.180
The most controversial aspect of our rules and uh,

23
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.960
our terms of service has probably this clause around public interest in

24
00:01:27.961 --> 00:01:31.350
newsworthiness where,
um,

25
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.990
powerful figures are public figures might be in violation of our terms of

26
00:01:36.991 --> 00:01:37.381
service,

27
00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:42.381
but the tweet itself is of public interest.

28
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.930
Yes,

29
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.930
there should be a conversation around it and that is probably the thing that

30
00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:52.110
people disagree with the most.
Um,

31
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.990
and where we have a lot of internal debate,

32
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.770
but we also have some pretty hard lines.
If we had a global leader,

33
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.510
including the president of United States,

34
00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:04.950
make a violent threat against a private individual,
we would take action.

35
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.170
We,
we always have to balance that with like,
is this a,

36
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.480
is this something that the public has interest in in,

37
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.980
I believe generally the answer is yes.
It's not going to be in every case.

38
00:02:16.981 --> 00:02:18.150
But generally the answer's yes.

39
00:02:18.151 --> 00:02:23.151
Because we should see how our leaders think and how they act in essentially,

40
00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:29.580
I don't forms voting that informs the conversation then forms whether we think

41
00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:32.860
they're going to,
they're doing the right job or we think that,
you know,

42
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.130
they should be,
uh,
they should be voted out.
Well,

43
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.880
<v 0>it's very important to see how someone uses that platform and when someone uses</v>

44
00:02:41.251 --> 00:02:45.390
it the way he uses it and then becomes president and continues to use it that

45
00:02:45.391 --> 00:02:48.380
way,
that's when people like what he's been consistent and I think he,

46
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.320
I think he joined

47
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.560
<v 1>2009,
2012 and yeah.</v>

48
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.300
You look at all of his tweets all the way back then and pretty consistent too.

49
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.130
Yeah.

50
00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.610
<v 0>He likes to insult people on Twitter.
It's for him.
It's just,</v>

51
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.240
I never thought he would keep doing it.
I thought once he became president,

52
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:06.970
maybe just lock it down and tried to do a good job for the country and then,

53
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.250
you know,
after four years or eight years,
just go back to his old self,

54
00:03:11.251 --> 00:03:16.200
fuck you fuck the world.
Fuck this.
Yeah.
But no,
he's,
he's,
he's just cute.

55
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.220
It's just in one way it's hilarious.
See,
as a comedian,

56
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.480
I think it's awesome because it's just,
it's so hilariously stupid.

57
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.160
It's so preposterous.

58
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.310
That even has the time to talk about Jeff Bezos is a fair and the fact that he

59
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:37.540
got caught with the national enquirer getting text messages and calls him Jeff

60
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.060
Bozo like,
don't you have shit to do man.
As,
but as a comedian,
I,

61
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.520
I am a gigantic fan of folly,

62
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.710
almost a against my better judgment.
I like watching it's,

63
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.640
I,
I want,
I like watching disasters.
I like watching chaos.

64
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.390
When I see nonsense like that and like,
oh Jesus,
like I,

65
00:03:58.391 --> 00:04:02.560
I'm drawn like a motto flame.
But on the other part of me is like,
man,

66
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.280
this sets a very bizarre tone for the entire country because one of the things

67
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.560
about Obama,
like Obama or hate Obama seems very measured,

68
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.620
very articulate,
obviously very well educated.

69
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.040
And I think that that aspect of his presidency was very good for all of us

70
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.710
because he represented something that was of a very high standard in terms of

71
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:31.900
his ability to communicate his access to words,

72
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.860
the way the way measured his words and held himself.

73
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.610
I think that that's good for us.
Like,
yeah.
Well it's,
yeah.
It's like,

74
00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:43.090
look at that guy.
He's talked better than me.
That's why he's the president.

75
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.710
But you know,
you ladies see Trump,
he like,
he's doesn't talk better than me.

76
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.850
He does.
He doesn't use Twitter better.
He's not,

77
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.070
he's just this fucking mad men.

78
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.140
But isn't it important to understand that and to see it exactly.
To,

79
00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.850
hopefully that informs opinions and actions 100% that's my point.

80
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.090
That's my point is like that this is this weird gray area where I think overall,

81
00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:09.010
I definitely support your decision to not,

82
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.660
not banned him for violating your terms of service.
Like we need to know.
Yeah.
