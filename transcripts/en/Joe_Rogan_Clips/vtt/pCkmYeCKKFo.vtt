Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.960
<v 1>I just read this book about the making of the Panama Canal.</v>

3
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.810
And they talk about,
you know,
when the front,
you know,

4
00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:12.220
the French first tried to do it,

5
00:00:12.221 --> 00:00:16.390
they went in and the late 19th century and they,
you know,

6
00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:18.970
you gotta think technology in the late 19th century,

7
00:00:18.971 --> 00:00:22.800
they didn't have fucking electricity.
They didn't have shit,
right?

8
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.220
They had giant machines and they were trying to bulldoze a,

9
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.560
a canal through the most dense tropical jungle that you could get through.

10
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.020
And,
and they,

11
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.190
and they lost something like 20% of the people that went down there,

12
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.620
died of malaria and yellow fever,

13
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.500
which are both mosquito borne diseases.

14
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.130
So they go down there and they fight it out for like 10 years.

15
00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:52.090
They keep sending people down to keep dying,
keep sending people down,
keep dying.

16
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.550
And uh,
and even if you don't die,

17
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.860
you're working 14 hour days in jungle heat with a fucking,

18
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.660
with a little spade.

19
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.700
And then all of a sudden they'd get a monster rain and everything you'd

20
00:01:06.701 --> 00:01:09.730
excavated,
there'd be a mudslide.
It would fill it right up again.

21
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.120
They'd start all over.
There were snakes,

22
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.650
there was fucking mountain lions,
and they just finally gave up.
Finally,

23
00:01:17.651 --> 00:01:22.630
France just went,
fuck this.
They had bled hundreds of millions of dollars.

24
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.350
And so and so.
Then the u s stepped in and I go,
we can do it.

25
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.280
So we came in and some guy in had realized that mosquitoes were the problem,

26
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.110
that nobody knew that malaria and yellow fever where mosquito mosquito born for

27
00:01:38.111 --> 00:01:41.470
whatever reason,
they just thought it was fucking popping out out of the dirt.

28
00:01:41.471 --> 00:01:44.680
They thought it was like fumes coming out of the dirt and this guy's like,
no,

29
00:01:44.681 --> 00:01:46.420
it's fucking mosquitoes.

30
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.990
So he came in with a team of like 10 people and they just started in educating

31
00:01:52.961 --> 00:01:54.430
people about how to get rid of mosquitoes,

32
00:01:54.431 --> 00:01:59.410
which is basically get rid of standing water.
And so instead of having mud roads,

33
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.960
they poured concrete.
And uh,

34
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.380
and instead of having open barrels that people collect rainwater and they would

35
00:02:05.381 --> 00:02:07.930
put sheets over them and,
uh,

36
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.240
<v 0>fucking God,
that's it.
That's all I had to do to stop the mosquitoes.</v>

37
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.900
No deaths from malaria and yellow fever.

38
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.170
After the first couple of years they started construction.
That's incredible.

39
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.590
Yeah.
So they just figured out a way to stop the mosquitoes from breeding without

40
00:02:22.591 --> 00:02:25.830
poison.
Without poison.
That's incredible.

41
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.100
I would have thought they would just agent orange the fuck out of that flows

42
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.620
just standing water.
Wow.

43
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.300
Do you know malaria has killed half the people that have ever died ever?
No Shit.

44
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.410
Wow.
Wow.
Tasks.

45
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.110
The people that have ever died ever in the history of the human race have died

46
00:02:43.111 --> 00:02:47.070
from malaria and still unabated.
No fucking cure.
My friend,

47
00:02:47.071 --> 00:02:50.940
Justin's got an a three times.
Really?
Where's he live?
Well,
he goes to the Congo.

48
00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:54.990
It makes wells for the pygmies.
Yeah.
Justin wren

49
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.650
<v 1>catch it and you take the pill right away.
You're fine.
If you</v>

50
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.260
<v 0>the proper medication,
you will be okay.
But um,</v>

51
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.720
there's a bunch of different strains of malaria and some of them last a long

52
00:03:06.721 --> 00:03:09.660
time and he's had one strain where he got it.

53
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.050
He recovered from it and then he got sick and because he got sick,

54
00:03:13.051 --> 00:03:14.160
the malaria came back.

55
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.330
So he got an unrelated illness without being around the mosquitoes and malaria

56
00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:21.540
came back and he had to figure it out that the malaria had made a relapse.

57
00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:25.260
So He's had it three times,
two times from being bitten one time from a relapse.

58
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.530
So is malaria something that just stays with you for life?

59
00:03:28.531 --> 00:03:31.830
Think with some cases and not just,
not necessarily for life,

60
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.880
but it can recur over the course of a certain amount of years and then your body

61
00:03:35.881 --> 00:03:39.030
eventually gets over it.
But he was saying that one case of malaria,

62
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.580
you can have it for as much as 30 years.

63
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.250
<v 1>Wow.
And dying of it is about as painful as it gets.</v>

64
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.000
Your brain starts to fucking fry.
You just go crazy.

65
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.050
Your entire body feels like it's made of acid.
It's brutal.

66
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.940
Fuck yeah.
Fuck.
You know,
and you think about how,
you know,

67
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.930
Third World,
how,
you know,
we're trying to,
we're trying to do good in the world.

68
00:04:02.931 --> 00:04:07.220
Malaria is just number one,
two and three that we should be focusing on.

69
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.890
<v 0>Yeah.
There was some work that they were doing.
Um,</v>

70
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.690
kind of want to say somewhere around California,

71
00:04:12.691 --> 00:04:17.520
someone was doing it where they were trying to figure out a way to engineer a

72
00:04:17.521 --> 00:04:22.521
mosquito that does not get malaria and they were going to release that mosquito.

73
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.440
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
I heard about this.
Is that what it was?

74
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.450
Well I think it happened with the Zika virus.

75
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.610
The malaria really kill half the people that ever lived get the facts.
Did it?

76
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.280
<v 1>It's a myth.
Oh it doesn't matter.
It's killer.</v>

77
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.130
It's definitely probably one of the biggest throughout human history.

78
00:04:38.131 --> 00:04:42.120
But to actually know the actual fact,
if it has killed that many people,

79
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.880
it's probably not cause it would have had to kill it at an average of five and a

80
00:04:44.881 --> 00:04:48.690
half,
a million per year.
And for like the last 30 or 40 years,

81
00:04:48.691 --> 00:04:50.910
it's only about two to 3 million.
So that number

82
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.790
<v 0>pretty good.
30 or 40 years?
At least 20%.
Yeah.
Hmm.
So,
but they don't know.</v>

83
00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.110
So where does it come from?
Does any,

84
00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.750
does any site support that this site tries to debunk it?

85
00:04:59.751 --> 00:05:01.910
We have to be sure that they're not right.

86
00:05:01.911 --> 00:05:05.150
Cause I feel like I read it from a science paper,

87
00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.130
which might not necessarily what click.

88
00:05:07.131 --> 00:05:09.770
We had rob wolf the other day and he thought that the vomitorium was really,

89
00:05:09.771 --> 00:05:14.150
some people make mistakes,
but it's a,

90
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.310
it's killed fuck loads of people.
It's just,

91
00:05:16.311 --> 00:05:19.130
there's a lot of those God damn diseases.
It scared the shit out of you.
Like,

92
00:05:19.131 --> 00:05:22.640
remember when the Ebola craze happened and everybody was panicking that a bullet

93
00:05:22.641 --> 00:05:25.160
had made its way to the United States.
Remember that one lady,

94
00:05:25.161 --> 00:05:29.300
she was a nurse and she was in quarantine and they tried to keep from
quarantine.

95
00:05:29.301 --> 00:05:32.480
She's like,
fuck you.
I'm going shopping.
Like Ooh,
that's right.
Yeah.

96
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.690
You like get your quarantine.
She's like,
I don't have it.

97
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.230
<v 1>Well the Zika thing is not under under wraps.
They've got it here.</v>

98
00:05:38.231 --> 00:05:40.930
It's down in Florida.
And uh,
I think that they,

99
00:05:40.931 --> 00:05:45.160
I know they were trying to genetically modify mosquitoes for Zika.

100
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.480
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm a friend of mine.
His wife got pregnant and he wouldn't,</v>

101
00:05:49.481 --> 00:05:51.390
he wouldn't let her go anywhere.
It's like we're there.

102
00:05:51.391 --> 00:05:54.560
We're supposed to go to Hawaii or maybe Mexico or something like that.

103
00:05:54.561 --> 00:05:56.910
And they were like,
fuck that.
We're not taking any,

104
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.590
we're gonna stay right here while this kid's born.
Fuck yeah.
Because it,

105
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.510
it's incurable and your kid develops a tiny head and it's a really creepy find.

106
00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:07.880
They don't even know what else happens because they're,
you know,

107
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:10.790
the kids that are born from it are only a few years old at this point.

108
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.930
Fucking crazy diseases.
So cruel,
so horrible.

109
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.560
There's a guy named Peter [inaudible] that I,
uh,

110
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.810
interviewed once and he was talking to me about,
um,

111
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.270
it was for my Scifi Shoulda did years back and he was talking to me about,
um,

112
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.910
jungle diseases,
like people that have,
um,
you know,
any sort of,
uh,

113
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.930
infestations of parasites and things like that in the jungle.
And he said,

114
00:06:32.931 --> 00:06:35.390
it is 100% of the people that live there.

115
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.610
They have the 100% of the people that live there have something.
Yeah,
100%.

116
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.600
I went hundred percent.

117
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.060
Does that mean they're living with it or they're suffering from it?

118
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:46.400
They're living with it.
I mean,
they might be suffering from it,

119
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:51.630
but one of them was,
um,
this,
uh,
cat parasite toxo plasma.

120
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.960
Have you ever heard of that?
Oh yeah,
we're pregnant.

121
00:06:53.961 --> 00:06:57.830
Women are super dangerous for women to like handle catch it because of it.

122
00:06:57.831 --> 00:07:01.370
You shouldn't touch a litter box or eat any vegetables in France because they

123
00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:02.810
don't.
Uh,
that was my,

124
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.840
my wife went to France when she was pregnant and they said that she couldn't eat

125
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.980
cheese because they don't pasteurize it out correctly in France.
Well,

126
00:07:09.981 --> 00:07:12.860
it makes sense.
They looked at rod stinky fucking cheese down there.

127
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.800
They love that stuff.
They love it.
But it,
um,

128
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.810
it's a weird one because it makes the,
the rat,
when a rat eats it,
ah,

129
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:25.040
or rat gets it and it's body a rat become sexually attracted to the smell of cat

130
00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:29.030
urine to the point where their dick gets hard and their ball swell up and they

131
00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:33.230
go find the cat and the cat kills him.
And then the cat relays it to people.

132
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.160
And one of the things it does with people's,
it makes him reckless.

133
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.820
So there's a direct,
there's a guy named Dr. Roberts,

134
00:07:39.821 --> 00:07:44.420
a Paul ski at a Stanford Who's done extensive research on Toxoplasma is fucking

135
00:07:44.421 --> 00:07:48.230
fascinating.
Guys get some awesome speeches where he talks about it online.

136
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.470
But one of the things they found when he was working in the Er is a direct

137
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:55.220
correlation between Toxoplasma and motorcycle accidents.

138
00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.000
Like a lot of these people that really,
Yup.

139
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.010
And people that would come in and they would have motorcycle accidents,

140
00:08:01.011 --> 00:08:04.190
they would test them and they'd find out they tested positive for toxo.

141
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:09.730
50 million people in America tested positive for toxoplasma where he ill.

142
00:08:09.891 --> 00:08:12.410
Yup.
And it,
it affects the way you think.

143
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:16.610
It affects your judgment and makes you more impulsive,
makes you more aggressive.

144
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:18.410
And it might even affect women.

145
00:08:18.411 --> 00:08:22.820
It might make women more promiscuous or at least make them more sexually

146
00:08:22.821 --> 00:08:27.020
submissive.
They don't know.
I mean this is just a complete total speculation,

147
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.960
but they think it might be one of the reasons why some South American countries

148
00:08:29.961 --> 00:08:34.150
are very macho and the women are like very sexy.
So why don't we went with cats.

149
00:08:34.151 --> 00:08:36.170
So he's live alone.
I don't think it's the same,

150
00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.190
but those cats never leave the house,
so,
so few don't have a cat.

151
00:08:40.191 --> 00:08:42.170
You can't catch this.
No,
you can catch it.

152
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:47.200
You can catch it from the meat of a cow that eats the cat shit in its,

153
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.850
in its grass like this.
Use a bunch of different ways.
A lot of people,

154
00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.000
currently there's probably 50 million people in the country that have this

155
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.050
currently in America.

156
00:08:54.051 --> 00:08:59.051
That's 50 people plus that are infected with this cat parasite called toxo.

157
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:03.060
Should you get tested for it?
No,
I probably have it for sure.
I'm scared.

158
00:09:03.061 --> 00:09:06.140
I don't want to get tested because you have cats,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm,

159
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:11.250
I'm definitely um,
Joey Diaz has 150,000 fucking cats.
Yeah,
he's for sure.

160
00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:15.060
Got It.
All those crazy cat ladies are guarantee they have.
Yeah.
Yeah.

161
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.070
It's a really common thing.

162
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.790
I think in France at one point there was something like 30% of the population

163
00:09:20.791 --> 00:09:25.270
had talkshow.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
It's real.
Well,

164
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.560
we may have feral cats.
Is that a bacteria then?
It's a parasite.

165
00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:33.220
It's some sort of a parasite that actually gets its way into your brain.

166
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:34.900
Because that's the crazy thing is what,

167
00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.020
I forget what percentage of your body weight is bacteria,

168
00:09:38.021 --> 00:09:42.790
but it's not staggering nuts.
Take charge.
15% of your body weight is bacteria.

169
00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.450
Yeah.
We're,
we're all up.
See,
I'm full of Shit.
I'm at,
first of all,

170
00:09:46.451 --> 00:09:49.120
find out how many people in America I've toxoplasma before we find that

171
00:09:49.121 --> 00:09:53.500
approximately 30 million.
30 million.
Wow.
It says it's the number on it.

172
00:09:53.501 --> 00:09:57.190
Pull it up.
See if bright 50 million.
See if I,
how do I remember that wrong?

173
00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:02.830
Right.
50 million people in America have talks with 20 of them died.
Oh my God.

174
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:06.340
I don't think it kills you on motorcycle wreck motorcycles.
Right.

175
00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:09.490
But so Paul [inaudible] was,
um,
he was,
uh,

176
00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.240
studying its effects on people and trying to figure out,
like,

177
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.130
they don't really know what it does to people.

178
00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:17.150
There's just this correlation between motorcycle accident.

179
00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.310
Then another thing that says up to 60 million people could have it.
So,
hmm.
Okay.

180
00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.660
Million people just in America,
Justin America and other countries,

181
00:10:25.661 --> 00:10:29.170
like in some South American countries,
it's a very high and uh,
you know,

182
00:10:29.171 --> 00:10:31.270
it might've been just something that people have been living with forever.

183
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:35.410
It's just there's some sort of a weird connection that we have to these

184
00:10:35.411 --> 00:10:38.100
organisms.
And in this one,
it,

185
00:10:38.101 --> 00:10:42.970
it rewires the sexual reward system of rodents changes the reward system.

186
00:10:42.971 --> 00:10:46.520
It makes their dick hard for cat piss.
So the day go near the cat,

187
00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:49.120
so they get killed so they can transmit it to people because cats hanging around

188
00:10:49.121 --> 00:10:53.140
with people,
right?
I mean,
assuming that that's the,
the chain of events.
Yeah.

189
00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.060
Fucking a man.
Jesus.

190
00:10:55.110 --> 00:11:00.110
I'll give that one to 3% of the body's mass and a 200 pound adults is two to six

191
00:11:00.281 --> 00:11:04.480
pounds of bacteria,
but also play a vital role in human health.
Wow.

192
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:08.410
Human body contains trillions of microorganisms.

193
00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.170
Outnumbering human cells by 10 to one.

194
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.300
<v 2>Oh Damn.</v>

195
00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:19.110
<v 0>What?
So 3% of the body's mass,</v>

196
00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:22.590
but they don't outnumber human cells just because of the size,

197
00:11:22.591 --> 00:11:23.880
cause they're small size.
However,

198
00:11:23.881 --> 00:11:26.910
the micro organisms make up only one to 3% of the body's mass.

199
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:31.260
It doesn't make as much as the mass,
but you are outnumbered.

200
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.530
Human cells are outnumbered 10 to one.
That's like,

201
00:11:34.531 --> 00:11:39.030
if there's every one rat for every person on a ship and there's,
you know,

202
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.630
10 people
think of that.
Hmm.
I mean,

203
00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:47.980
that's a fucking infested rat filled ship.
Well,
the,
some of the bacteria is good.

204
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.370
Some of it is.
Yeah.
But I'm just saying you're mostly rats.
Yeah.
See,

205
00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:55.660
like what is that a ship of people?
Well,
some people on it.
Yeah.
Right.

206
00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.340
It's mostly rats.
I mean,
it's mostly rap fucking rat ship.
Yeah.
It's a,
we are,

207
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.880
I mean,
if you had a hundred people,
a thousand rats on a ship,

208
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.760
which say that's a ship full of people or ship full of rats.

209
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.260
It's a shippable Uracil to pour a bunch of poor fuckers trying to get some
sleep.

210
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.080
Yeah.
We're just bags of bacteria.

211
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:17.830
We're bags of bacteria and we don't understand a lot of it.

212
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.580
Cause it is,
it's so fucking small and it's mysterious.

213
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:31.200
<v 2>Yeah.</v>
