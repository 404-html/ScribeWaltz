1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.450
Good to see you.
Happy to be here.
I listened to your podcast with Jack.

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.820
Let's just get right into the jump in the Jack stuff.

3
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.910
Cause I listened to your podcast with Jack and I've found something very,

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.130
when I did my podcast with Jack,

5
00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:15.540
first of all was not anticipating the blow back that I received.
It was stunning.

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.970
But,
um,
he what,

7
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.830
what I thought was I was just going to have a conversation with this guy.
Be Fun.

8
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.390
See what it's like to run this gigantic network that helps people communicate

9
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.100
you.
Okay,
Jimmy.
All right.

10
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.970
Helps people communicate and distribute information worldwide.

11
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:36.060
What does it like to start something like that up and have it become what it is?

12
00:00:36.061 --> 00:00:38.370
Like how have you managed to try to keep up with it?

13
00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:42.150
And what of the headaches been?
And apparently people online,

14
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.860
particularly the people that want to comment about this,

15
00:00:43.861 --> 00:00:48.861
all they wanted to know about with censorship and that was an issue with me.

16
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.060
There was a question with me,
but it became a far,

17
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.190
it was a far bigger question for people online.

18
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.930
They felt like that I tossed him softball questions.
Um,

19
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.680
and that I didn't press him.
Yeah.

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.950
And then I listened to your podcast and a one thing about Jack is very smart
guy,

21
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:05.813
very nice guy,

22
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.410
but he talks in a very slow and methodical way.

23
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.850
And when you ask him a question,

24
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.210
he takes these routes and if you don't want to jump in and press him,

25
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.750
like you're in this weird situation where he's not totally answering your

26
00:01:21.751 --> 00:01:25.880
question,
but he's talking about the same subject that you're talking to.

27
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.070
Like for instance,
you brought up Louis Farrakhan,
right?
Like,

28
00:01:29.071 --> 00:01:32.070
how's Louis Farrakhan in good standing on the platform?
And someone like,

29
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.880
you know,
fill in the blank,
Milo Yiannopoulos or Laura Loomer or whoever it was,

30
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.550
they get kicked off.
He never got to that.

31
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.700
He went around and around and around with you.
And um,

32
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.910
he recognized this after the podcast.
Uh,
I received a lot of blow back.

33
00:01:47.911 --> 00:01:49.260
He received a lot of blow back.

34
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.950
So I contacted him and he said he'd be more than happy to come back on again and

35
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.470
address all these things.
And I said,
okay,

36
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.830
what I'd like to do is address specific instances of people being censored.

37
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.360
And he said,
okay,

38
00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:04.350
what I'll do is I'll bring in someone from the company that's in charge of that

39
00:02:04.351 --> 00:02:05.450
stuff,
right?

40
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.290
So I'm starting to put together a picture of what it's like to be a CEO of

41
00:02:10.291 --> 00:02:14.970
something as big.
And he's also a CEO of square.
He's runs the cash app.

42
00:02:14.971 --> 00:02:17.670
There's a lot of stuff going on there,
right?
So He's obviously busy.

43
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.560
How much day to day involvement does he actually have and who gets censored in

44
00:02:22.561 --> 00:02:25.290
why they get censored and how much is he willing to share about that?

45
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.100
So we're gonna find out in the next follow up podcast,

46
00:02:29.101 --> 00:02:34.101
but I got accused of everything from being a shill to being a cock to being a,

47
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.790
and there's also an issue that you've managed to avoid wisely.

48
00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:42.600
So of advertising the cash apps,
an advertiser on my podcast.

49
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.440
So because the cash apps and advertiser on my podcast,
right?

50
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.480
The man had you by the throat exactly how you think that and ask all those great

51
00:02:48.481 --> 00:02:50.700
questions that were queued up.
The reality is,

52
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.770
those are the questions I would've asked.

53
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.440
Now that's hard to say because no one's gonna believe it.

54
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.530
But those are the questions I were asked and I tried not to be too

55
00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:00.370
confrontational

56
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.203
<v 1>with a guest,</v>

57
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.710
but in hindsight I probably could have pressed more particularly on people like

58
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.230
Kathy Griffin.
I'm calling for doxing for the,

59
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.450
the kid with the Maggot hat on with the native American.
There was quite a few,

60
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:18.070
but I noticed that.
Well,
what was your experience like with it?

61
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.530
Yeah,
so it's interesting cause you and I have,
uh,

62
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.240
we had different interviews because they were time differently than me.
This,

63
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.630
it's an interesting topic because this opens the door to all the ways in which

64
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:31.360
our podcasts are different.
I mean,
they use stream live.

65
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:33.880
I sit on my podcast for at least a week.
So I mean,

66
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.120
in Jack's case it was like two weeks before I released it.
So,
um,

67
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.210
I did my interview with him before this flurry of interviews with him came out.

68
00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:46.480
I mean there's a rolling stone interview.
There was a,
uh,
uh,

69
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:48.760
I think only I think maybe a Huffington post interview would come out,

70
00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:50.350
but basically there was nothing out there.

71
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.350
So I had no real examples of how he dealt with these questions or how we talked.

72
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.890
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,
I mean,

73
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.530
slow talking is not a problem for me cause I'm one of the great slow talker.

74
00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.570
So we're,
we're in a groove there.
Um,
but he,
um,

75
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.000
I,
I didn't know what his boiler plate was and how he would,

76
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.440
he would answer any of these questions.
And,
uh,

77
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.000
your podcast came out before mine did,
but mine was,

78
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.380
mine was before the Covington in high school.
Catholic.
Oh,
circus happened.
Right.

79
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.390
So the,
the real missed opportunity for me was just a sheer matter of timing,

80
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.210
you know,

81
00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.190
because the Covington thing puts such a fine point on everything that's wrong

82
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:33.220
with Twitter and the way journalism interacts with it.
Right.
And it was,
it just,

83
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.030
you know,
uh,

84
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.710
I think it was a Farhad Manjoo wrote an op Ed in the New York Times saying

85
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.150
Twitter is destroyed journalism and,
and,
and it was not a crazy op ed.
In fact,

86
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.770
uh,
after the Covington thing and the whole,

87
00:04:45.771 --> 00:04:48.810
you and Kathy Griffin would've been the perfect example to talk about it,

88
00:04:48.811 --> 00:04:51.700
but like what,
you know,
why is she still on if she's calling for the doc scene?

89
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.860
Right.
Yeah.
But you know,
I,

90
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:58.810
I think I had a substantially similar interview with him that you did,

91
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.590
uh,
because he's,
there's two things.

92
00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:07.591
One is he is great at sort of pure wedding around th th th th the sharp pointed

93
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.950
question of,
you know,
what is the policy and why,

94
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.750
why are you applying it and this seemingly disparate way,
uh,

95
00:05:13.751 --> 00:05:18.400
and it seems to skew politically in one direction all the time.
Right?
Uh,

96
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.820
but I think you also,
I mean,
you know,

97
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.950
I did and I think you did naturally,

98
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.900
we cut him some slack in that he's the CEO of these two corporations.

99
00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:33.700
He can't be expected to actually know what happened in every one of these

100
00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:36.120
microcases.
Like,
I think I brought up the case of,

101
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.200
I think her name is Megan Murphy.
I mean,
I hadn't even heard of her before.

102
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.230
The lesbian woman,

103
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.560
she's like a feminist who said sort of the wrong thing in the transgender space.

104
00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:48.800
She said something like,
men are not women.
Right?

105
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.820
And she got banned and life or no,
I think it was temporary,
but you know,

106
00:05:53.821 --> 00:05:56.740
so I raised it and you know,
he,

107
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.700
he obviously can't know exactly what happened in that case or at least it would

108
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:03.140
be surprising to me if he knew.

109
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.400
So the fact that he doesn't have his finger on each one of these cases and what

110
00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:10.010
their,
what the rationale was,

111
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:14.330
and he has this sort of generic answer that what you're seeing,
you know,

112
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.480
in public is not necessarily what we're seeing.
In fact,

113
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.800
in virtually every actionable case is not what we're seeing in private with

114
00:06:21.801 --> 00:06:23.810
respect to how these people are all opening,

115
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.700
opening multiple accounts and doing seemingly nefarious stuff behind the scenes.

116
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.300
Now,
whether that is true,
I don't know,
but I,
I mean,

117
00:06:32.301 --> 00:06:36.050
I can just say that Jack seemed,
um,
one,
I,

118
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.550
I liked him and he seemed unusually open to talking about anything.

119
00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:43.970
I wanted to talk about it.
So I saw one allegation they got a of you was that,

120
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.800
you know,
you must have been constrained by,
you know,

121
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.890
the topics you couldn't touch in advance.

122
00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:51.980
He must've had some agreement with him in advance.
You know,

123
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.920
that didn't happen with me right now.
I should dress that there was no,

124
00:06:54.921 --> 00:06:58.730
no discussion whatsoever about what was off limits.
Yeah,
no,
nothing.

125
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.210
And he asked her,
no.
So in my case,
I tell all my guests,

126
00:07:02.211 --> 00:07:05.330
and this is the difference between use streaming live and,
and me not,

127
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.130
I tell all my guess.
Listen,

128
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.760
if at any point in this interview you put your foot in your mouth or I put my

129
00:07:10.761 --> 00:07:13.850
foot in there,
we can edit it,
right?
Like we,
I want you,

130
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:17.570
I want you to be totally happy with what you say over the next two or three

131
00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:21.440
hours.
Uh,
so if you have to take something again,

132
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:24.530
take it again and you know,
we'll just hide the seams as we go.

133
00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:28.230
Now that virtually never happens.
Right.
And in Jack's case,
it,

134
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:33.190
there wasn't even a wrinkle like that.
So,
um,
but you know,
I just,
you know,

135
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.320
I,
I recognize it's a high wire act for a lot of these people,

136
00:07:36.321 --> 00:07:40.760
especially for someone who's running two publicly traded companies.
Right.
And,
um,

137
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.480
you know,
it was the one I invited him on.
I said,
I said jacket,

138
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.830
we were DM and on Twitter and I said,
listen,

139
00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:49.910
I promise I'm not going to make you smoke a blunt on video that got him.

140
00:07:49.911 --> 00:07:53.040
So I don't know how you got him,
but I didn't try to get them to slow,

141
00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.990
but I didn't even think about it.
Yeah.
We weren't drinking.
We were just talking.

142
00:07:56.991 --> 00:08:00.140
Maybe it'd been better if we were drinking because it did seem very stiff.
Um,

143
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.210
I listened to it after the fact and

144
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:08.850
I mean I get from their anticipation why it would be disappointing.

145
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.580
I just thought it was kind of boring.

146
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.430
I thought my podcast with him just wasn't very good.

147
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:18.740
I sometimes do too many podcasts and when I sometimes do too many podcasts,

148
00:08:18.741 --> 00:08:23.480
I think I run low on juice and I'm not as a,
I dunno,

149
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:28.510
I'm not as engaged or I'm not as fired up about it and maybe I just should have.

150
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.680
I've definitely should've prepared more for him.

151
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:34.490
But I really thought it was just going to be a conversation about what it's
like.

152
00:08:34.491 --> 00:08:37.520
And I thought that would be really easy to do because it's such a unique

153
00:08:37.521 --> 00:08:40.970
position to be running something like Twitter.
But he,
you know,

154
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.530
I don't know if he was evasive and because he didn't know the things or because

155
00:08:45.531 --> 00:08:48.500
he didn't want to talk about the things,
but there was things like,

156
00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:52.790
he didn't know exactly why Alex Jones was ultimately banned.

157
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.230
He didn't,
he couldn't recall or didn't know.
No.

158
00:08:55.231 --> 00:08:58.020
Is that because he couldn't recall it was because he didn't want to talk about

159
00:08:58.021 --> 00:09:02.250
it?
Or is it because he didn't remember it?
I mean,
I don't,
I don't know.
I mean,

160
00:09:02.251 --> 00:09:05.870
you'd have to,
you'd have to be inside his head to get that answer.
Yeah.
Mean,
he,

161
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.550
he's clearly got a,

162
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:13.590
a very practice line that he uses to answer these questions.
And I mean,
cause I,

163
00:09:13.591 --> 00:09:15.840
you know,
I know what it's like to have boiler plate now.
You know,

164
00:09:15.841 --> 00:09:18.660
I've been a book on a book tour and you're just basically getting asked the same

165
00:09:18.661 --> 00:09:19.800
questions again and again.

166
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:24.800
And here he's getting asked fairly pointed questions about,

167
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.380
you know,
where Twitter is going and he's got,
you know,

168
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.240
I don't think this is dishonest,
I just think,

169
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.720
but it has this amazing ability to close the door to further inquiry because he,

170
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.120
he gives you the full mia culpa right upfront.
You asked me like,
well,
what's,

171
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:45.570
what's the situation with,
you know,
the seemingly asymmetrical banding of people?

172
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.420
And he'll say,
you know,
yeah,
we really,
I mean,

173
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.670
we've got to get much better at communicating our process.

174
00:09:50.671 --> 00:09:52.350
We're not nearly transparent enough.

175
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:55.920
This whole thing is in disarray and my job is to fix it,
right?

176
00:09:55.921 --> 00:09:59.790
So it's like a global,
you know,
we're fucked up and we're going to get better,

177
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:00.970
I promise you,
right?
Yeah.

178
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.000
And there's do any good for the people that already banned.
Right?

179
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:09.450
But there's not a lot to get beyond that in an interview,
you know,
whether,

180
00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:14.100
you know,
I don't think it's nefarious.
I think it could well be totally honest.

181
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:15.960
Uh,
but it does have,

182
00:10:15.961 --> 00:10:20.310
this is a fact of you just keep reaching a certain kind of brick wall but you

183
00:10:20.311 --> 00:10:22.560
didn't know was going to be there,
you know.
Yeah.
That's,
I,

184
00:10:22.561 --> 00:10:25.830
I felt that too and I didn't,
didn't really match,

185
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:29.280
navigate that very well and that was a big part of the blow back.

186
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:32.640
But then the blow back was accentuated when they found out that he sponsors me.

187
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:33.090
Right.

188
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:37.980
Cause the cash APP is one of his businesses and its sponsors the podcast.

189
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:42.420
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well I had a very similar result and I don't have that,
that problem.

190
00:10:42.421 --> 00:10:45.720
So you know,
that I don't think that diagnosis your situation at all.

191
00:10:45.721 --> 00:10:49.620
But it's very,
I mean the difference between these business,

192
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.270
the business models under which we run our podcasts and um,

193
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.411
just the different,
I mean,

194
00:10:55.411 --> 00:10:58.260
just every choice you make and how to produce a podcast.

195
00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.540
I essentially have made the opposite one.
You know,

196
00:11:00.541 --> 00:11:04.560
there's like streaming live like this,
the fact that you're,
so,

197
00:11:04.561 --> 00:11:05.940
this is just all very interesting to me.

198
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:11.340
I'm kind of a reluctant student of digital media now because I've just kind of

199
00:11:11.341 --> 00:11:15.390
stumbled into this wild west that,
you know,
you in large part have invented,

200
00:11:15.391 --> 00:11:19.140
right?
I mean this podcasting space was nothing.
And now we've got Spotify,

201
00:11:19.141 --> 00:11:22.560
you know,
buying up and it says he's like a land grab for audio.
Yeah,
the,

202
00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:26.370
we were talking about that before the podcast.
They just purchased some company.

203
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.630
What does it,
what is it called?

204
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:32.880
Kevin went for some godly amount of money.
Yeah.
Like $200 million.

205
00:11:32.881 --> 00:11:35.840
They're going to spend 500 this year or something.
And so it's,

206
00:11:35.841 --> 00:11:40.360
it's this w we're all just making this up and you know,
I'm making,

207
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:42.720
and you know,
I've just released a meditation APP,

208
00:11:42.721 --> 00:11:45.480
which is a different business model still.

209
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.350
And so now I have these kind of two parallel digital businesses happening in my

210
00:11:49.351 --> 00:11:53.380
life and it's,
um,
it's just very interesting.

211
00:11:53.381 --> 00:11:56.590
The decisions you make are a force to make and the consequences of it.

212
00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.810
And so like the fact that we're having this conversation live,

213
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.720
you don't even have to think about whether you're going to edit this,
right?

214
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:04.360
Cause it's gonna be streaming live.
And you know,
we're going to,
when we're done,

215
00:12:04.361 --> 00:12:08.950
we're going to turn off the mics and walk out of here and your job is done with

216
00:12:08.951 --> 00:12:12.250
my podcast.
That's not the workflow at all.
And I,
so I,

217
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:17.500
I totally envy this,
this approach that you have,
but for a variety of reasons,

218
00:12:17.501 --> 00:12:21.220
I feel like I can't take it in,
in my life.
And so it's,
it's,
uh,

219
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:26.070
but it is very different and it dictates many choices,
you know,

220
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.160
down the line,
which,
um,
uh,
I mean there's,

221
00:12:30.161 --> 00:12:32.120
there's a positive and negative,
but it's,
you know,
the,

222
00:12:32.121 --> 00:12:37.121
the positive is what you hear is what we got and we're done after we turn these

223
00:12:37.331 --> 00:12:40.540
mikes off.
And that's,
and that's not,
you know,
that's not how I podcast.

224
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.450
<v 0>There's also the visual element of it and the visual element of it.</v>

225
00:12:43.451 --> 00:12:46.670
And initially it was almost like a side effect.
I mean we,

226
00:12:46.671 --> 00:12:50.710
we first started it out visually,
but then when it started going to iTunes,

227
00:12:50.711 --> 00:12:53.750
the iTunes aspect of it became the focus.
The uh,

228
00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:55.900
audio version of it rather became the focus.

229
00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:00.190
But then we decided to stream on Youtube and put it up on Youtube.

230
00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:04.930
But it was totally not profitable.
It was just for,
for a goof like,
oh,

231
00:13:04.931 --> 00:13:07.210
we'll have the video up.
Why not?
Some people like video.

232
00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:08.260
It was one of those things.

233
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:12.700
But then you realize ultimately that youtube becomes a viable source of revenue.

234
00:13:12.701 --> 00:13:17.080
And then it's also the way a lot of people like to watch it,
you know?

235
00:13:17.081 --> 00:13:19.900
And they also like to watch it because they can comment under it.

236
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.210
So that was the other thing that came out of the Jack podcast.

237
00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:27.210
We got into a controversy about comments and about how comments are deleted or

238
00:13:28.031 --> 00:13:32.320
how they sh they're shown in hidden and what happens cause people were accusing

239
00:13:32.321 --> 00:13:37.321
Jamie of deleting all the derogatory comments that we don't touch any,

240
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.020
we don't,
we don't delete any of them.
We don't do anything to them.

241
00:13:41.021 --> 00:13:45.580
We just leave them up there.
And it's a mostly a cesspool,
but I mean,

242
00:13:45.581 --> 00:13:47.230
even even on a good podcast,

243
00:13:47.231 --> 00:13:51.100
there's a lot of crazy shit that happens on these things.
But from what we think,

244
00:13:51.101 --> 00:13:52.300
and Jamie correct me if I'm wrong,

245
00:13:52.301 --> 00:13:56.050
you think that what's going on is that people are marking other people's posts

246
00:13:56.051 --> 00:13:58.270
as spam.
Yeah.
There's that.

247
00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:03.250
And then Brandon also has a theory that a lot of alt right people are targeted

248
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.900
by the algorithm that youtube uses.
Like in,
in,
in one case,

249
00:14:07.901 --> 00:14:11.130
there was a guy who had a pepe,
the frog Avatar,
and he said like his,

250
00:14:11.131 --> 00:14:16.131
his comment immediately went to spam and that the other thing is that the

251
00:14:16.421 --> 00:14:21.421
comments are curated depending upon who is watching it and what account it will

252
00:14:21.521 --> 00:14:24.040
be.
There'll be different sort of,
yeah.
The,

253
00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:27.400
they'll propagate different comments to the top.
It's not a this,

254
00:14:27.401 --> 00:14:31.420
you can actually change it if you,
if you prefer to see the most new comment,

255
00:14:31.421 --> 00:14:34.380
like from your own personal youtube when you're watching you,

256
00:14:34.381 --> 00:14:39.010
you as a viewer or user of Youtube half to make that actual,
yeah.
So that,

257
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:42.280
that conspiracy theory just heightened the whole thing.
Right.
Okay.

258
00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:46.450
Now they're deleting negative comments like,
look,
I don't like doing bad podcast,

259
00:14:46.451 --> 00:14:49.510
but I will be the first one to tell you when I think a podcast sucked.

260
00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:53.960
That was definitely disappointing.
It wasn't good.
Mine wasn't good.
It was,

261
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.510
like I said,
when I listened to it,
I was like,
God,
this is kind of boring.

262
00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:01.910
It just wasn't,
it wasn't juicy.
There was nothing,
we didn't get a flow.

263
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.370
It wasn't like he and I were just shooting the shit

264
00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:06.670
<v 1>time.
What's it take that one decision.</v>

265
00:15:06.671 --> 00:15:10.800
So you have decided to make video a main component of this podcast know it's

266
00:15:10.801 --> 00:15:14.890
still probably a small percentage of your actual listens.
You're not anymore.

267
00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:18.800
Not Anymore.
It's,
it's gotten to,
well it's almost 50 50 oh,
awesome.

268
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:23.740
Closing in on that.
It used to be like 90 10 right?
Yeah.
Okay.
So I have it.

269
00:15:23.741 --> 00:15:26.680
I don't have a video component and so I just put audio on Youtube,

270
00:15:26.681 --> 00:15:30.880
but I put absolutely no energy and to youtube.
I mean that may one day change,

271
00:15:30.881 --> 00:15:34.780
but because I don't,
I don't care what's happening on Youtube.
Right.

272
00:15:34.781 --> 00:15:39.010
So I never see the comments.
And whenever I look,
it is,
as you say,
assessable,

273
00:15:39.011 --> 00:15:43.690
it's insane.
I mean,
youtube is just skews massively,
right?
It's skews,
you know,

274
00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:48.740
just a massively mail and it's probably skews very young too.

275
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:53.760
So you have it just like millennial alt-right craziness.
Right?
Like,

276
00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:55.090
like as I say these sentences,

277
00:15:55.091 --> 00:15:57.610
your youtube page or just blowing up with hate for me,

278
00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.780
you've got a bunch of millennials with a thumbs up their acids,
just when Jane.

279
00:16:01.781 --> 00:16:04.330
Right.
You know,
this'll be older people too.
Well,
yeah.

280
00:16:04.331 --> 00:16:08.050
But I mean it's gotta be younger than,
than most of,
of where,
well,
first of all,

281
00:16:08.051 --> 00:16:12.730
I'm not even seeing most common threads that could possibly respond to anything

282
00:16:12.731 --> 00:16:14.110
I put out there now.
Right.
So I got a,

283
00:16:14.111 --> 00:16:16.240
I don't even look at my app mentions for the most part,

284
00:16:16.241 --> 00:16:18.730
I spend maybe five minutes a day looking at that's healthy,

285
00:16:18.731 --> 00:16:21.310
but it's coming back to me and [inaudible] were actually helpful and,

286
00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:25.200
and reformat in my brain on that,
on that topic.
But,
um,

287
00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.030
so because I don't see any of that stuff,

288
00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.150
I mean maybe I'm getting a lot of pain for my Dorsey interview,

289
00:16:31.151 --> 00:16:34.660
but I don't even know about it.
Right.
And so I'm not having,

290
00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:39.370
I don't feel like I have to course correct in response to anything now and in

291
00:16:39.371 --> 00:16:43.860
large measure it is a consequence of just this decision that,
you know,

292
00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:45.400
I inadvertently made that I'm just,

293
00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:48.580
I don't have a video component to my podcast at the moment.
And so I'm not,

294
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:51.910
I'm not spectating on the,
you know,
the feedback on Youtube.

295
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:55.250
<v 0>Well the feedback thing is interesting because what we're just talking about</v>

296
00:16:55.251 --> 00:16:58.880
this before the show that with feedback and comments on youtube,

297
00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.810
essentially anyone can comment and if you don't go banning people from the

298
00:17:02.811 --> 00:17:05.800
channel,
which we don't do,
it's not what we wouldn't do.

299
00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:09.410
Someone was totally a piece of shit,
but we don't.

300
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:12.980
So you essentially have this open forum.

301
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:15.650
So it's like almost like a message board where people would be just sort of

302
00:17:15.651 --> 00:17:19.850
comment and it's unlike Twitter in that regard because Twitter just,
you know,

303
00:17:19.851 --> 00:17:22.430
you get abusive and Shitty on Twitter.
They just get rid of you.

304
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:26.330
If you get abusive in Shitty on Instagram or on Facebook,
Facebook,

305
00:17:26.331 --> 00:17:27.164
they'll just get rid of you.

306
00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:31.190
But if you're on youtube and you're in those comments,

307
00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:32.750
you could kind of get away with more.

308
00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:37.460
So I would imagine that people that don't appreciate censorship and want to just

309
00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:40.370
just fucking spew out whatever's on their mind,

310
00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:43.430
that would be the place that they would go,
especially if it's the same product.

311
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:44.990
Essentially.
The only thing different,

312
00:17:44.991 --> 00:17:47.960
and this is a thing where it got confusing with the youtube people versus the

313
00:17:47.961 --> 00:17:49.980
audio people with the audio people,

314
00:17:49.981 --> 00:17:53.880
it's very obvious that the cash app has a sponsor because it's,
we say it,

315
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.300
this podcast is brought to you by the cash app,
whereas in Youtube they're like,

316
00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:00.380
aw,
they're hiding the fact that the cash apps a sponsor,
right.

317
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.790
We talked about it during the podcast itself,

318
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:07.410
but we don't put the ads on Youtube.
We,

319
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.420
there's ads that youtube puts on,

320
00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.120
but we put the ads on like after the show is over,

321
00:18:12.121 --> 00:18:16.050
I'll read the ads and we'll insert those into the audio and that will go up to

322
00:18:16.051 --> 00:18:20.580
iTunes and RSS feeds and all that stuff.
So the stuff that's on youtube,

323
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:24.810
it's abbreviated in the sense that especially the live one doesn't have
anything.

324
00:18:24.811 --> 00:18:29.160
So like this has zero ads and then the ones that will be posted on youtube
later,

325
00:18:29.161 --> 00:18:31.820
a little have youtube ads.
Right.
So that's why there's,

326
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:34.260
so there was a couple of conspiracy theories in that regard.

327
00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:38.940
There's also apparently an emerging conspiracy theory about that Jack was trying

328
00:18:38.941 --> 00:18:43.350
to pump up bitcoin because they have some sort of a bit coin deal.

329
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.580
Have you heard this one?
I read that,
but like it's,
from what I saw,

330
00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:51.570
it's not higher than it was at any point.
It's still right around $3,500.

331
00:18:51.571 --> 00:18:54.660
So if there was a pump and dump scheme of some sort,

332
00:18:54.661 --> 00:18:58.500
then like it should be shooting like provable on a blockchain,
I guess.
I Dunno.

333
00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:01.410
Yeah,
I don't understand that.
But is there any other component to it?

334
00:19:01.411 --> 00:19:03.480
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know where that was coming from.
This,

335
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.930
I don't even know what did it.
All he said was that,
well,

336
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:10.200
the cash APP sells bitcoins.
So we talked about Bitcoin,

337
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.890
I think because you can buy and sell bitcoin through the cash app,
I should say.

338
00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:15.960
I think he said something about blockchain technology,

339
00:19:15.961 --> 00:19:18.360
rendering everything permanent online,
and that was,

340
00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:20.520
that was something different though.
Yeah,
but that,
that,

341
00:19:20.521 --> 00:19:24.960
I think that's in regard to comments into anything.
Blog posts,

342
00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:28.650
blockchain is essentially going to have everything that's online forever,

343
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.920
but there's so many fucking conspiracy theories about all this stuff.
It's,

344
00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:34.980
it's fascinating.
