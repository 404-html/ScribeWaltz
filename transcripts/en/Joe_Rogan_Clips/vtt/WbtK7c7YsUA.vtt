WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.410
New thing.
This is a new thing.

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.720
So because this is a new thing I feel like for some reason,

3
00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:06.240
but it is human nature thing.
I think it is human nature,

4
00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:09.600
but I don't understand what your point is.
Well,

5
00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:13.980
I guess what I'm asking here is,
is is in,
in the way of the,

6
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.670
I just feel like the Russian Bot thing is,
was all of that,

7
00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:20.250
I feel like the Russian bots is,
is a,

8
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.230
is a term for people who don't understand computers in a way,
and they've,

9
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.200
they've just kind of thrown that out there as a political device sometimes
think,

10
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.270
I think that Russia,
China,
Korea,

11
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.160
like every other fucking country that is enabled in a way in which they're so

12
00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:42.780
far ahead technologically was involved in all kinds of fucking fuckery.

13
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.170
And they're still involved in it.
Will still do that during the election.

14
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.760
It was fucking a hundred times.
But,
uh,
you know,
I'm just,

15
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.980
I just,
it's hard for me with,
you know,

16
00:00:52.981 --> 00:00:57.630
back circling around to the Alex Jones thing,
all of this new technology,

17
00:00:57.631 --> 00:01:02.631
all of the people who are awake woke Facebook on Facebook.

18
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.940
They know you're in HR,
you're woke on Facebook,
so awake,
you know,
it's like a,

19
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.970
I felt bad for fucking childish Gambino that he had a song that had stay woke

20
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.511
and it,

21
00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:16.440
because immediately that song that that was what an amazing song and it was a,

22
00:01:16.441 --> 00:01:20.190
it was uh,
that that term became dumb immediately.
But I,

23
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.840
but I just feel like,
um,
all of this that's happening,

24
00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:28.440
all of this talk,
all of the him getting banned,
all this stuff,

25
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.470
it's all this kind of like effect of the world instead of being out in the

26
00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:42.120
world.
Everyone has,
has,
has gone to this point where it's,
you know,
these groups,

27
00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:43.260
these really rich cribs,

28
00:01:43.261 --> 00:01:46.320
Google and Facebook and Twitter and all this and everyone has,

29
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.040
has gone to this central point and other lynching people,

30
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.370
whether or not you agree with Alex Jones,
whether or not you like him,

31
00:01:53.371 --> 00:01:57.270
whether or not I think he's being launched there.
So I get,

32
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.560
I get that there's all these people that are doing all these different nefarious

33
00:02:01.561 --> 00:02:05.070
things and this has been going on forever and now they're using new systems to

34
00:02:05.071 --> 00:02:05.490
do that.

35
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.880
They using the internet and all these open pipes and these connections that they

36
00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:10.950
can make trick is that the public is there.

37
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.880
They've gotten them to go to this a one arena.
That is my problem with it.

38
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.210
Is it like as much of a nerd and a technology person?
I am.
I like,

39
00:02:18.211 --> 00:02:22.350
I hate that people have instead of really,

40
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.630
I mean I'm sure they have their own lives,

41
00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:29.340
but like the fact that we have become so centralized to these small groups of

42
00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:34.341
Internet companies like social media and things and then now look,

43
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.050
it's on both sides,
man.
I mean Alex Jones is getting lynched.
Harvey Weinstein,

44
00:02:40.051 --> 00:02:44.310
whatever.
I know he's,
he's a very different things,
but every,
everyone is a very,

45
00:02:44.311 --> 00:02:47.430
very,
very,
very,
very different than not defending him.

46
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.500
But I understand how you made this behavior,

47
00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:52.080
but do you understand the connection is the connection connections.

48
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:56.130
People are just attack the findings.
The minute it look,

49
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.770
those people could have suits against Harvey Weinstein,
Stein Steen,

50
00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:00.491
and we can know about it.

51
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:03.340
Of course we knew about it because the Wall Street Journal or whoever,

52
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.780
or New York Times who were in that thing,
but then New Yorker.
Yeah,

53
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.380
it was the New Yorker.
Yeah.
But like,
I guess my point is,
is,

54
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.910
you know,
I mean,
I,
I'm sure this is an unpopular opinion,

55
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:20.911
but I just feel like that the centralization of society into social media is

56
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:27.520
resulting in a lot of things that are very ugly.

57
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.490
And I think that the Russian Bot thing,

58
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.080
the Chinese hackers thing,
the Alex Jones issue,

59
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.530
the me too movement,
all that stuff,
which I,
I'm,

60
00:03:37.531 --> 00:03:39.730
I'm behind all of the people that,
that were hurt.

61
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.200
I'm not on behind the sandy hooks,

62
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:44.380
people on behind the people who had the bad experiences in Hollywood,

63
00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:47.800
all that I'm buying.
What are you proposing?
I'm just saying that I think that,

64
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.570
that it's unhealthy.

65
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.430
I think that social media thing has become too centralized.

66
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.200
There needs to be decentralized,
uh,

67
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.830
sort of centralized because there's only a of groups like Facebook and Twitter.

68
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.670
They are Instagram.
I mean,
it's 100% centralized.
I mean,
it's owned by a group,

69
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.290
several groups.
It's several,
uh,
you know,

70
00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:13.291
everyone's kind of going to Mcdonald's to have these conversations as opposed to

71
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.080
it being something that is a little more healthy.
I just find,

72
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.970
I just think that that people,

73
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.990
I think Alex Jones should have always been able to be crazy in his world.

74
00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:26.140
And he was always nice to me.
And you,
like you said,
he's your friend.
Like,

75
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.990
you know what the problem with Alex's,

76
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.970
he needs someone sitting right next to him.
Someone like me,

77
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.330
someone who when he talks and he said something crazy,
go wait a minute.
Wait,

78
00:04:34.331 --> 00:04:35.860
how do you know that?
And he goes,
well,

79
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.110
we have the documents will show me the documents.
Well,

80
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.090
the documents don't say that.
Well,
you know,

81
00:04:40.091 --> 00:04:43.360
the problem is gel or they are definitely trying to influence.
And he'd go,
yeah,

82
00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:45.610
they probably are.
But if you leave them alone,

83
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.120
if you leave them alone and just let them rant.
By the way,
he's doing six hours,

84
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.590
eight hours of radio a fucking day.
And he's definitely likes to drink.

85
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.400
So he's doing six hours of radio a day.
At least three of them are drunk.

86
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.440
And he's fucking fill in time and screaming and no one could say anything to
him.

87
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.260
And he's the fucking man over there.
That's also part of the problem.

88
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.410
He's got a bunch of these other people that are around them all the time and are

89
00:05:08.411 --> 00:05:12.250
conspiracy theories as well.
But there are 28 and you know,
and then you know,

90
00:05:12.251 --> 00:05:16.030
they're hanging out with Alex Jones and it goes on these rants and no one

91
00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:20.020
interrupts them.
It's a broad argument with all of it because I agree.

92
00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:23.290
But he was always,
he was always transmitting.
He was always like,
Hey,

93
00:05:23.291 --> 00:05:26.800
show me where the Satanists are going to worship.
It took to sacrifice children.

94
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.360
That's fine.
But I get,

95
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:33.190
I think what happened is now the idea is that he's influencing people

96
00:05:33.191 --> 00:05:38.110
politically.
Like the whole,
you know,
the whole uh,
Podesta pizza gate,

97
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.420
that all that stuff was scared the shit out of people.

98
00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:44.180
And that guy showed up at that pizza place and fire off around and you know,

99
00:05:44.181 --> 00:05:46.630
and then they want to arrest them and they really thought there was a dungeon in

100
00:05:46.631 --> 00:05:47.680
the basement where again,

101
00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:52.410
kids centralizing in social media is the cause for a lot of these reactions.

102
00:05:52.411 --> 00:05:57.411
Is that centralizing and social media or is that people exciting people to and

103
00:05:57.621 --> 00:06:00.800
take action against something that may or may not even be real if you are you

104
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:03.800
allowed to yell out fire in a crowded theater,
right?

105
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.180
This is ultimately the problem,
right?

106
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.590
It's not whether or not he believes in Bohemian Grove,
which is real.

107
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.600
And he proved it on video back when they had VHS tapes and I watched it.
I mean,

108
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.320
I've known Alex since 99 or 98 I think maybe I've known him for a long ass time

109
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.200
and this is a very big difference between then and what's happening now is as

110
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.850
far as the reach and influence,

111
00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:32.180
and I think people are sort of panicking about reach and influence and what it

112
00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:34.970
means and how to mitigate it,
how to change people,

113
00:06:34.971 --> 00:06:38.210
how to stop people from going into pizza places and shooting them up because

114
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:40.430
they think that something that they heard online is true.

115
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.990
There's a lot of stuff that people hear online.
There is just not true,
you know,

116
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:48.050
the lizards underground or the fucking earth flat.

117
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.980
There's a lot of stuff that's just nonsense.
So it's,
it's hard to separate.

118
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.000
Here's what I think.

119
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.470
I think we are going through an adolescent stage as a,

120
00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.500
as a being,
as an evolving being.

121
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.830
And I think our bodies and our minds and our consciousness are becoming

122
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.730
synchronized with technology and along the way,

123
00:07:10.731 --> 00:07:15.380
like right now we are in this chaotic screaming,
sweating,
crying,

124
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.190
pissing,
shitting,
state of chaos.

125
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.240
And we're looking to figure out how to stop the bleeding.

126
00:07:23.241 --> 00:07:25.700
We're looking to shove thumbs into dykes,

127
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:31.030
dykes meaning like dams and we're looking to try to figure out a way to stop the

128
00:07:31.731 --> 00:07:35.240
bleeding.
We're trying to put patches and bandaids on things.

129
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.240
We're trying to manage the chaos.
We're trying to figure out what,

130
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:42.120
and this is a stage that we're going through because this,
hold on a second.

131
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.380
This is a new thing.
This is a new thing for human beings.

132
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:50.420
The ability to communicate widespread over millions and millions of people

133
00:07:50.421 --> 00:07:52.460
instantaneously is a new thing.

134
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:57.260
So people have say that never had say before they have influenced it never had

135
00:07:57.261 --> 00:07:57.891
influenced before.

136
00:07:57.891 --> 00:08:00.650
They have their ability to contribute and they might not have thought these

137
00:08:00.651 --> 00:08:05.600
things through and these things catch fire and they run through dry forest like

138
00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:08.990
a goddamn tornado of,
of,
of,

139
00:08:08.991 --> 00:08:13.690
of flames that you see on CNN when men to see no fire up in northern California.

140
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:18.170
This is what happens with ideas because there's no way to contain them and they

141
00:08:18.171 --> 00:08:19.670
don't know what's right or what's wrong.

142
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.830
I think that what we're going through from the period of 1994 the period of 2018

143
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.550
is like a crazy fire in the middle of a hurricane.

144
00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:32.900
It's like everything is nuts and no one knows how to stop it and no one knows

145
00:08:32.901 --> 00:08:34.430
what to do.
And what do we do?

146
00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:38.120
We get together and shelters and we fucking give people water and we tried to

147
00:08:38.121 --> 00:08:40.070
stop the fire and take away everyone's lighters.

148
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.710
And that's what we're doing right now.
We're trying to take away lighters.

149
00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.110
We're trying to stop people who start fires.

150
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:50.000
And this is what's happening with Alex and it's,
it's not that Alex is a bad guy,

151
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.820
is that he has,
he's by himself.
Okay.

152
00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:59.260
It's irresponsible to say that you know for sure a fact that these parents from

153
00:08:59.551 --> 00:09:02.910
sandy hook or crisis actors and their kids never died.
It's irresponsible.

154
00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.350
And he didn't think it was irresponsible when he was doing it because he's

155
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:10.740
probably caught up in what he does and he's caught up in the wave of ad libbing

156
00:09:10.741 --> 00:09:12.150
just like you and I are ad libbing.

157
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.770
We didn't even talk about what the fuck we're going to talk about.
Right.

158
00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:18.540
We just turned on and where we had a couple of drinks.

159
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.120
You're what you're saying there is very right.
And I don't mean to cut you off.

160
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:26.220
It's okay,
but,
but what you're saying there is very smart because to me,

161
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:30.730
uh,
you know,
it is,
you're right.
He,

162
00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:35.580
he has always been doing this and it just point in time his reach has grown

163
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:40.320
right now there's a wind behind them.
He used to be in Seattle,

164
00:09:40.321 --> 00:09:43.500
it was raining every day and he had a little patch of dry newspaper,

165
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.640
like that shit on fire and everybody go,
hi.
Alex is crazy.
Yeah,
no,
I agree.

166
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:48.600
I think,
I think,

167
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:52.260
I think what I'm trying to articulate and I'm not doing as well as I wanted to,

168
00:09:52.261 --> 00:09:57.261
but I think what my problem is is the synchronization of consciousness is what

169
00:09:57.481 --> 00:10:01.020
I'm not into.
I think that,
I think,
you know,

170
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:05.940
just like you have a Rut of people who believe that,

171
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.440
uh,
you know,

172
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:12.300
they now believe that the sandy hook thing is fake and they're calling the

173
00:10:12.301 --> 00:10:14.400
families because of this conversation.

174
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.150
This is where that lawsuit is really coming from because the other people,

175
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.350
but then you also have another side of it.
And it could be,
as you know,

176
00:10:22.351 --> 00:10:25.500
back in the day when they said that Paul Mccartney was dead,

177
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.810
but they got harassed,

178
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.840
but it was on such a small level because there was no way to just email Paul

179
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.560
Mccartney and,
or email and say,
you're not the real public McCartney.

180
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.020
You're fucking dead.
Not just that.

181
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.750
There was no way to exchange these ideas amongst

182
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.710
real time on Facebook all day long,

183
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:51.510
which is the centralization that creates these rivers and in these ruts that

184
00:10:51.511 --> 00:10:55.020
people who don't know what to do and they fall into one rut or another and they

185
00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:58.530
kind of become this,
this,
this kind of streamline thing.

186
00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:02.160
So I think the way you just described it as is very,
um,

187
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:05.160
articulate this new thing.
Matt is a new thing.

188
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.790
When we are in a really exciting time.
But why?
Why I say that?

189
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.890
Because they used to say that about the printing press.

190
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.020
They used to worry about that with the written word.

191
00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:14.610
They used to worry about that with everything.

192
00:11:14.611 --> 00:11:17.910
The distribution of information is not,
it's not whether or not it's healthy.

193
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:22.940
It's just a part of what the this being does with this being does is constantly

194
00:11:23.101 --> 00:11:27.570
search for innovation and novelty.
That's what,
that's what the human being does.

195
00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:32.610
But like the,
I guess I guess yes,
but it was looking at your phone over there,

196
00:11:32.611 --> 00:11:33.750
man.
You got to fucking iPhone.

197
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:37.440
Don't you think you'd go to the people make an iPhone and go,
hey bro,
we're good.

198
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.370
Yeah.
Yes.
Is it,
this is stop.
You can stop.
It's not,
we're not good.

199
00:11:41.371 --> 00:11:45.210
These mother fuckers are ready to come out with the iPhone 11 then like the guy,

200
00:11:45.211 --> 00:11:46.050
you're not going to stop.

201
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:50.340
The [inaudible] has been at the web was invented hyperlinks and the idea was

202
00:11:50.341 --> 00:11:54.370
that if someone want to be too hard to,
this is just,
Oh,
I'm in,
I'm in.

203
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.030
So like the guy invented the web got stolen.

204
00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:02.620
His name and I should know is Gore mother fucker.
However.
Right.
That's funny.

205
00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.730
He lies.
So this cat,
this cat,
eh,

206
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.940
all he wanted to do was make it basically where like medical documents where you

207
00:12:09.941 --> 00:12:11.680
would,
where you would say like,
you know,

208
00:12:11.681 --> 00:12:15.430
this guy had a brain transplant and then brain transplant will be underlined and

209
00:12:15.431 --> 00:12:18.850
you clicked on that and it would take you to a link that explain brain

210
00:12:18.851 --> 00:12:21.040
transplants and that would be worldwide.

211
00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:26.460
So the Internet is decentralized and the web is decentralized to some degree.

212
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:31.180
Okay.
Now Google coming in with search engines,
like that's focusing points.

213
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:36.210
What scares me is those people being like Facebook being the avenue in whichever

214
00:12:36.441 --> 00:12:38.530
it be talks like I,
I would just scare you.

215
00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.960
Is that weed I just handed you holy Shit.

216
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:45.180
I took two hits and I'm not even here anymore.
I'm an Auntie.

217
00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:47.740
I am very high.
That's a blunt.

218
00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:51.610
That's legit or took two hits.
I liked the little,

219
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.690
I'll fuck around here in California Sun.
But you know what I mean?

220
00:12:55.691 --> 00:12:59.580
Like I just have a problem with the centralization of the companies owning the

221
00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:02.740
avenues in which get taught.
I right.
I'm right.
I'm right with you on that.

222
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:04.250
I think we need more youtube.

223
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.320
I think we need more venues for people to distribute,

224
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:11.650
distribute information.
But I also think we need more love,

225
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:17.320
more compassion.
There's so much hate and anger towards each other.
Let's keep,
I,

226
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:21.370
I feel like I'm going to get arc nailed here on this because I'm not,
I am not.

227
00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:24.300
Well,
it's part of the nervousness about doing a live show,
right?
Yeah.
I'm,

228
00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.340
while you were talking about,
and I would say,
um,

229
00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:30.610
well I mean I'm very nervous right now.
I haven't fucking drink but,

230
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:34.510
but I would say I'm very nervous.
I would say that,
um,
oh,

231
00:13:34.511 --> 00:13:37.480
this is one of those ones where they,
that's,
that's tobacco,

232
00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:42.250
tobacco and some shit that was growing on Mars.
You know,

233
00:13:42.251 --> 00:13:45.120
Armstrong grew weed,
man.

234
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:49.090
See I again,
again,

235
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:51.760
it was just like there was a point when you're trying to make sense right now.

236
00:13:51.761 --> 00:13:53.290
This is part of the problem,
right?
I know.

237
00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:55.000
This is why I wanted us to get out of it.
And we're getting,

238
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.850
we're getting super serious about topics that are very,

239
00:13:57.851 --> 00:14:01.660
that mean a lot to people and we don't really know enough about it.
I just,

240
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:06.630
I just feel like,
I just wish that there weren't,
like,
again,
I just,

241
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.460
I feel like there's reps that have people have to fall in to communicate and

242
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:13.090
[inaudible].
Those are ruts that are owned by these companies that,

243
00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.130
that are very fucking rich and very well.
Here's the thing too.

244
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:20.860
These companies didn't see this comment like I'm libertarian.
I'm not either way.

245
00:14:20.861 --> 00:14:22.810
And just in the sense I'm not really that,

246
00:14:22.811 --> 00:14:24.160
I don't even fucking know what that is.

247
00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:29.000
All I know is I don't believe in trusting anybody who,
who,

248
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:33.520
who says,
Hey,
I'll take care of you.
Come this way.
Just don't worry about a thing.

249
00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.860
And they're the ones making all the money.
And it's like,

250
00:14:35.861 --> 00:14:39.910
that's how the Internet has become.
It used to be a wild west of information.

251
00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.340
Emails are fucking information that is,

252
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.690
that's me communicating with you and no one else seeing it.
That's beautiful.

253
00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.300
And I think the idea of Twitter and Facebook and all that,

254
00:14:49.301 --> 00:14:51.040
it's fantastic when it first started,

255
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.080
but at this point in time it's gotten so big.

256
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:57.350
If it doesn't break up into something where people figure out that they are in

257
00:14:57.351 --> 00:15:01.070
control of the Internet,
not these other people.
That's what bothers me.

258
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:05.000
What bothers you is it someone comes along and says the people aren't in
control.

259
00:15:05.001 --> 00:15:06.770
The Internet,
so it's not like a free market.

260
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.040
So in the free is the funds aren't come up.
It was a free market.

261
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.310
It's a free market.
A guy like Alex Jones,
you'd say this guy is preposterous.

262
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.660
I'm not listening to him anymore.

263
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.730
When it's not a free market is when youtube collapse.

264
00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.010
I Dunno if they collaborate,
if they just all grows.

265
00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:21.230
I don't know if they all agree,

266
00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.110
but they just all decide everyone's gonna take 'em off.

267
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:26.180
Facebook's gonna suspend him for 30 days.

268
00:15:26.181 --> 00:15:27.860
Twitter's going to suspend it for a period of time.

269
00:15:27.861 --> 00:15:29.090
Youtube is going to remove him.

270
00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.300
All these people are going to take Vimeo jumped on ship and they pulled them off

271
00:15:32.301 --> 00:15:34.560
too.
So this,
this becomes an issue.
Like,

272
00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:38.780
what is it that causes you to get removed?

273
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:43.100
What is it and should we be really clear on that?
Or is this just a whim?

274
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.320
Because this is a really important thing.

275
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:47.180
If we really are fucking with free speech,

276
00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.940
we have to be very careful on what we decide.

277
00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:55.190
Is is a valid reason to pull people off of our airways?

278
00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:00.400
Because if you have stuff on your airways that's far more vial and you let that

279
00:16:00.561 --> 00:16:04.430
stay up because it doesn't have the same reach,
like what is your criteria?

280
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:06.260
It doesn't have the same influence.

281
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.720
It doesn't have the same political ties to it.

282
00:16:08.721 --> 00:16:13.130
Like what is the reason why you're pulling one thing off and not another thing?

283
00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.870
Is it because of the popularity issue?

284
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:20.110
Have you searched your trillions of fucking hours of footage for offensive

285
00:16:20.841 --> 00:16:24.630
speech,
content ideas,
uh,

286
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:27.380
disinformation,
what have you,

287
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:29.990
what have you really done to mitigate this issue?

288
00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:35.260
Or are you acting on this because it's a social hot spot issue right now,

289
00:16:35.601 --> 00:16:38.090
which it most certainly is and most certainly should be.

290
00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:42.370
I really think that Alex needs a guy right next to him.
He really like,

291
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:46.820
I understand this.
And I did a show together and Howard Stern,
man,

292
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:50.360
no,
not the same comparison because Howard's,
but listen man,

293
00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.990
let's do them every day.
But sometimes I want to be like,
dude,
are you kidding me?

294
00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:56.940
But that's also part of his charm.
Part of his charm.

295
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.070
She creates descent in arguments and you want to get mad and you want to either

296
00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:05.210
he's opinionated.
Well,
but how it's turns very responsible.
He's a different guy.

297
00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.180
It's not,
it's not the same thing.
I'm not trying to compare Alex to him.

298
00:17:08.181 --> 00:17:11.310
I'm just saying that sometimes I feel the same way about it,
about him,

299
00:17:11.311 --> 00:17:13.660
and not to feel that way about us right now.

300
00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:18.140
This is quit cutting fucking Giorgio Moroder tribute records and do a country

301
00:17:18.141 --> 00:17:20.740
record.
You know,
and I do a country record right now and they're like,
oh,

302
00:17:20.741 --> 00:17:25.490
it's Kinda corny.
No.
Uh,
now I got a record coming,
by the way.
I'm sure you do,

303
00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:26.180
Dude.
I'm a.
