1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.110
You're raising your kids here,
what,
what's your policy on letting them out?
Man,

2
00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:06.500
it's slippery.
Hello?
How old is your oldest?
Well,

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.490
having grown one who's 22 and then I have a a 10 and an eight.
Okay.

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.960
And it's hard man,

5
00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:17.780
because I don't even like when they go over on sleepovers over a friend's house.

6
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.010
Scary.
Whose problem is that?
It's everybody's problem.
You know,
it's uh,

7
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.360
well I mean the parents,
I mean we're,
we're pretty selective about the parents,

8
00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:30.090
but there's a lot of parents that don't pay attention to their kids at all.

9
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.730
Meaning they just tune out and they get on the phone.

10
00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:36.180
The kids are sticking forks into the fucking outlets.
And you know,
there's,

11
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.830
there's a lot of weirdness when it comes to the styles of that people have been

12
00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:44.420
raising their children.
What does this,
uh,
this graph he just pulled up?
So,

13
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.010
you know,
um,
depressive episodes.

14
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.550
So I guess I'll just narrate it for people are listening,
not watching video,

15
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.571
you know?
So you said before,

16
00:00:51.571 --> 00:00:54.540
it's like a virus came out of nowhere and that is sort of what it's been like.

17
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.740
Um,
so what's happening in America and I know what's happening at the same in

18
00:00:58.741 --> 00:01:01.020
Britain and Canada.
I haven't looked at other,
other places yet,

19
00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:02.800
haven't dug into those stats.
Um,

20
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.530
what's happening is that rates of depression and anxiety were fairly stable,
uh,

21
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.820
from the nineties through the early two thousands.
And what you see here,

22
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:14.510
and this is a graph that's in our book,
is that the,
uh,

23
00:01:14.511 --> 00:01:19.511
the percentage of kids aged 12 to 17 in America who met the criteria for having

24
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:23.280
a major depressive episode.
That is,
they're given a symptom checklists,

25
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:26.340
but nine symptoms.
And if you say yes to five of them,
uh,
you know,

26
00:01:26.341 --> 00:01:30.870
feeling hopeless and couldn't get out of bed.
Um,
if you say yes to five or more,

27
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.690
you're,
you're considered to have had a major depressive episode.

28
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.230
And what you see is that the rate for boys is around 5%.

29
00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:40.920
And then around 2011 it starts going up and now it's around 7%,

30
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.800
which is actually a somewhat substantial increase.
Uh,

31
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.240
but as you can see in the graph,

32
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.770
the line for girls starts off higher cause girls have more mood disorders,

33
00:01:49.771 --> 00:01:53.220
more anxiety,
depression.
Boys have more antisocial behavior,
alcoholism,

34
00:01:53.221 --> 00:01:55.710
crime and violence.
But girls turn it,

35
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.500
it's called an internalizing disordered girls basically make themselves

36
00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:01.950
miserable.
Boys make other people miserable.
Uh,
the gross rate is higher,

37
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.200
but it was stable from,
you know,
2000,
uh,

38
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.340
at least in that graph from 2005 through 2010 and then right around 2011,

39
00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:11.880
2012 starts going up and it goes way up to the point where it goes up from about

40
00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:12.840
12% to now,

41
00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:17.841
about 20% of American teenage girls have had a major depressive episode in the

42
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.960
last year,
one in five.
So this is huge.
Okay,
next slide.

43
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.150
Now let's look just at college students.
So this is more selective.

44
00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:28.590
These are kids who've made it into college.

45
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.830
And what we see is that in 2010 and 28 and 2012 when college students,

46
00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:36.960
we're all millennials,
the rates were pretty low.
This is,

47
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:38.910
do you have a psychological disorder?

48
00:02:38.911 --> 00:02:42.240
And they didn't specify they or they said such as depression.
Uh,

49
00:02:42.241 --> 00:02:46.800
and so we see about a two to 3% of the boys,
uh,
the college men,

50
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.570
and about 5% of a five to 6% of college women say yes to that question.

51
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.730
That's when it was millennials.
But beginning of 2013,
Gen z begins arriving.

52
00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.480
That's kids born in 1995,
uh,
z begins arriving.
And so by 2016,

53
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.040
colleges are almost all gen z and the rates shoot up way up.

54
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.600
<v 1>Yeah.
We're looking at these charts right now and folks who are just listening.</v>

55
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.760
The,
it's like,
it's a like a jump ramp for a BMX racer.

56
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.460
I mean,
it really is crazy for whim out of nowhere.

57
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.230
And it hits at 2012 it goes on a very sharp upward angle,

58
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.570
right.
Cause from six less than 6% to almost 15% in the space of four years.

59
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.440
That's crazy.
It's crazy.
A book.
You can't say that.
That's a mechanism.
Crazy.

60
00:03:31.441 --> 00:03:34.380
It's a crazy,
what can I say?
A fucking nuts.

61
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.830
And I say that now because some people might have been that allergy.

62
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.420
Oh boy.
Um,
ludicrous.
It's preposterous.
It's really frightening.

63
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.310
Really frightening.

64
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.490
<v 0>Yeah.
And so this has huge ramification.
Now let me just make clear,</v>

65
00:03:49.491 --> 00:03:52.310
I think we have another,
another slide there would bring up the next one.

66
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.640
Okay.
So,
um,
some people say,
oh,
come on you guys,

67
00:03:58.641 --> 00:04:02.990
or catastrophizing,
the increase isn't real.
It's just that,
you know,

68
00:04:02.991 --> 00:04:07.240
this generation,
they're really comfortable talking about mental illness.
Um,

69
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.210
and so the fact that they say they're depressed just means they're comfortable.

70
00:04:11.211 --> 00:04:12.620
It doesn't mean that there's an epidemic of,

71
00:04:12.621 --> 00:04:16.400
I've heard this argument that it's just an argument of recognition rather than

72
00:04:16.401 --> 00:04:17.810
have perfectly reason.
That's right.

73
00:04:17.811 --> 00:04:21.170
Diagnostic criteria changed perfectly reasonable argument.
Is it true?
Well,

74
00:04:21.171 --> 00:04:22.040
let's look at behavior.

75
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.280
So with this graph shows is the number of boys out of 100,000 who are admitted

76
00:04:27.801 --> 00:04:31.450
to a hospital every year because they cut,
they deliberately harmed themselves.

77
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.350
They had to be hospitalized.
And what you see here is that,
um,
the,

78
00:04:35.351 --> 00:04:40.040
there's no change over time.
So boys,
these graphs from 2001 to 2015,

79
00:04:40.041 --> 00:04:42.400
the lines are flat for all the different age groups.
Um,

80
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.770
and just notice that the highest rates are around 280 out of 100,000 per year.

81
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.100
That's the situation for boys.
Next Raf Bang.

82
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.450
The situation for girls is really,
really different.
So the averages are higher.

83
00:04:56.451 --> 00:05:00.100
So self harm has always been more of a girl thing than a boy thing.
Um,
via,

84
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.340
you know,
boys are,
except for suicide.
Exactly.
We'll get to that.
That's right.

85
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.980
That's next.
So if we look at self harm,

86
00:05:06.981 --> 00:05:11.690
what you see here is that the rates were fairly stable up until 2009 and then

87
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.410
bang,
just as in the lastly,
same thing,
the rates for girls go shooting up.

88
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.590
So the rate for 15 to 19 year old girls is up 62% since 2009.

89
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.310
Um,
now notice the rate for the millennials.

90
00:05:25.311 --> 00:05:29.510
That is the rate for the oldest girls age 20 to 24.
That's only up 17%.

91
00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.640
So whatever happened,
it's not effecting the millennials,
it's effecting Gen z.

92
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.760
I think ways there when it hit the advanced key cause I think there's one number

93
00:05:37.761 --> 00:05:41.420
missing there.
Ah,
okay.
I'll just uh,
no go forward.
Okay.

94
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.420
The number of the narrative there.
It is the rate for the youngest girls.

95
00:05:44.421 --> 00:05:48.050
Check that out.
Now the youngest growth,
these are 10 to 14 year old girls.

96
00:05:48.051 --> 00:05:51.200
These are preteens,
okay.
They didn't use to cut themselves.

97
00:05:51.201 --> 00:05:55.610
They used to have very low rates,
but bang,
beginning in 2010 it shoots up.

98
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.250
It's up 189%.

99
00:05:58.251 --> 00:06:02.240
It has nearly tripled in the last five or six years.
What's the gone?

100
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.020
We don't know for sure,
but the reason why,

101
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:09.950
so because of the huge sex difference,
the leading candidate and the timing.

102
00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:11.780
Look at that.
Timing is social media.

103
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.580
So if you look at what happened in this country and all around the world,
um,

104
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.690
Facebook opens up to the world in 2006 you know,

105
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:20.930
you don't have to be a college student,

106
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.100
but very few teenagers have a Facebook account.

107
00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.050
2006 2007 the iPhone comes out,

108
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.510
but it's very expensive and very few teenagers have won.

109
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.380
By 2010 2011 around half of American teenagers have an iPhone or Samsung.

110
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:40.580
They have a smartphone and they have access to social media in middle school.

111
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.770
Because even though for Facebook and Instagram,

112
00:06:42.771 --> 00:06:46.220
I think the minimum age is and was 13 you know,
I mean my,

113
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.280
my son is 12 or a lot of his friends have Instagram.
You just lie.

114
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:54.490
So middle school kids are now getting on social media by 2010 2011 you've got a

115
00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:55.220
lot of them.

116
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.330
And that's what I think is the main cause of this because social media does not

117
00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:03.290
really affect boys very much.
But man,
does it affect girls?
Why is that?

118
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.470
So if you look at,
so a couple of reasons.
First,

119
00:07:06.471 --> 00:07:11.120
look at the nature of aggression within the sexes.
Boys bullying is physical.

120
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:11.601
Okay?

121
00:07:11.601 --> 00:07:14.870
Boys are physically dominating and then the risk is that they're going to get

122
00:07:14.871 --> 00:07:19.730
punched.
Okay,
so you give everybody an iPhone.
What do they do with it?

123
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.720
Games and porn.
They don't use it to hurt each other.
Um,

124
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.740
boys,
your boys.
That's right.
It doesn't affect their bullying.

125
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.760
But girls aggression that girls are actually as aggressive as boys.

126
00:07:31.761 --> 00:07:33.800
There's research from the eighties and nineties on this.

127
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.230
If you include relational aggression,

128
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.650
girls don't bully each other by threatening to punch each other.
In the face.

129
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.550
Girls bully each other by damaging the other girls' social relationships,

130
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.610
spreading rumors,
spreading lies,
spreading a doctorate,
photograph,

131
00:07:46.611 --> 00:07:49.760
saying bad things,
excluding them.
It's relational aggression.

132
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.060
And so it's always been really hard to be a middle school student.

133
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:57.410
It's always been harder to be middle school girl than a middle school boy.
Okay?

134
00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:01.790
So beginning around 2010,
2011,
we throw in this brand new thing into the mix.

135
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.080
Okay girls,

136
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.790
here's this beautiful thing in your hand and here's all these programs where you

137
00:08:07.791 --> 00:08:08.990
can damage anyone.

138
00:08:08.991 --> 00:08:13.250
Social relationships anytime of the day or night with deniability from an

139
00:08:13.251 --> 00:08:17.310
anonymous account.
Go at it,
girls.
And so,
um,

140
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.360
the nature of girls bullying is hypercharged by social media and smartphones.

141
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:26.070
That's one mechanism.
The other two mechanisms,
um,

142
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:30.920
are the social comparison because it's always been hard to be a teen girl

143
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:33.680
emerging with beauty standards and impossible beauty standards.

144
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.711
And when we were kids,

145
00:08:34.711 --> 00:08:39.050
you had impossible beauty standards that these models were all doctored up and

146
00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:42.740
then Photoshop.
Okay?
So you've got these impossible beauty standards out there.

147
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.740
But beginning with social media,
and especially in recent years,

148
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.240
your own friends can put on a filter and Instagram to make their lips big or

149
00:08:50.241 --> 00:08:52.370
their skin cleaner,
their eyes bigger.

150
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.770
So your own friends are more beautiful than they are in real life.

151
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.890
You feel uglier.
So that's the social comparison of beauty.

152
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:03.300
And then probably the biggest single one is the fear of missing out,

153
00:09:03.301 --> 00:09:06.540
the fear of being left out.
So all kids are subject to this.

154
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:08.940
Everyone's concerned about whether they're included or whether they're,

155
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.880
they're excluded,
but girls are much more sensitive.

156
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.710
And so suddenly when everybody is tracking each others who was invited,

157
00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:17.520
who's there,

158
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.930
and especially any program in which a girl puts something out and then waits to

159
00:09:21.931 --> 00:09:26.400
see what other people say about it,
that is what's really damaging.
I think we,

160
00:09:26.401 --> 00:09:30.060
again,
let me stress,
we don't know for sure there are some experiments on this,

161
00:09:30.061 --> 00:09:32.820
but it's mostly correlational stuff we're talking about here at correlational

162
00:09:32.821 --> 00:09:33.670
data.
Um,

163
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:39.080
but the overall experience of being a girl who was born in 1995 or later and got

164
00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:42.900
this stuff in middle school is different from being a girl born in 1990,

165
00:09:42.901 --> 00:09:45.000
let's say we didn't get this stuff until college.

166
00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:49.710
Are you concerned that this is a trend that as technology becomes more and more

167
00:09:49.711 --> 00:09:54.711
invasive and with these new technologies as they emerge that this is going to be

168
00:09:55.051 --> 00:09:58.930
worse?
Yes,
yes.
But it doesn't have to be so,

169
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.960
so I think in the last two years were really waking up to this,
um,

170
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.480
the founders of this technology.
It's really interesting.
So first of all,

171
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:08.990
it's important to note as many people have read the,

172
00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:12.060
it's a lot of the creators of this technology do not let their kids have it.

173
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.850
So they know that these things were made to be addictive.

174
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.380
They're made to grab eyeballs and not let go.
So,
um,
um,

175
00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.270
that's one thing we all wish to keep that in mind,

176
00:10:21.271 --> 00:10:23.490
that the makers of this are wary of it.
Second,

177
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.250
they've gotten more and more addictive as they've gotten better and better as

178
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:28.860
they've evolved.
Um,
so they're getting more and more.

179
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:33.820
And Fortnite is an example of,
of uh,
you know,
uh,
extremely addictive game.
Um,

180
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:39.670
um,
and it does.
But,
uh,
so when you,
if you've ever been to a,
um,

181
00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:44.940
uh,
a casino and you've seen kids,
you've seen people sitting at those machines,

182
00:10:44.941 --> 00:10:48.450
like zombies just you know,
hour after hour pulling that crank.

183
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.740
Cause there were psychologists working out the variable reinforcement schedule

184
00:10:52.741 --> 00:10:55.200
for the gambling companies,
psychologist,

185
00:10:55.201 --> 00:10:58.950
they're helping companies manipulate users and that's happening to our kids too.

186
00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.550
They're,
they're are manipulated to stay on the device.

187
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.570
So once we're beginning to realize this,
the nature of these technologies,

188
00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:12.050
the fact that what is good for adults may be terrible for 12 year olds,

189
00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:13.440
10 year olds.

190
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:18.810
And once we realize that these things are so attractive that they crowd out all

191
00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:21.000
the other healthy activities like playing outside,

192
00:11:21.001 --> 00:11:24.900
playing with groups of friends.
Um,
once we realize that,
I think,

193
00:11:24.901 --> 00:11:28.140
and I hope we'll get some reasonable norms.
And what I'd like to propose,

194
00:11:28.141 --> 00:11:31.110
this is fantastic to be able to talk to so many people.
Um,

195
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:33.240
what I'd like to propose is if you have kids,

196
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.460
especially if you have kids under about 16,

197
00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:39.450
please do what you can to talk with other parents.

198
00:11:39.451 --> 00:11:42.600
And especially with the principal at any schools,
you know,

199
00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:47.070
and say we need some sensible norms because we can't solve this problem by

200
00:11:47.071 --> 00:11:51.480
ourselves.
So I want to keep my kids off social media.
But my son says,
well,

201
00:11:51.481 --> 00:11:54.160
most of my friends,
or have Instagram accounts now,

202
00:11:54.161 --> 00:11:57.130
if it was every friend and he was the only one who was excluded,

203
00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:59.500
it will be really hard for me to stick to my guns.
I would do,

204
00:11:59.501 --> 00:12:00.460
it would be really hard.

205
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.820
Whereas if it was only a few of his friends and most of them weren't,

206
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.730
it would be so easy.
And I hear that from parents over and over.

207
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:10.420
I don't want my kid on social media,
but I don't want her to be left out.

208
00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:14.950
And so if the principal would just say,
parents,
please,
this is getting,

209
00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:17.620
this is getting out of hand.
This is harming kids.
Look at the data,

210
00:12:17.621 --> 00:12:20.440
look at the suicide rates,
look at the,
look at the self harm rates.

211
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.320
We've got to do something.
What do you do?
A couple things.

212
00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.650
I think it's pretty a couple of pretty simple norms.
One,

213
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.570
all devices out of the bedroom by a set time,
at least half an hour before bed,

214
00:12:31.571 --> 00:12:36.550
there is no reason why kids should have an iPhone or a computer or a screen in

215
00:12:36.551 --> 00:12:39.670
their bedroom because so many kids are attracted to it.

216
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:42.730
They'll check their status overnight and it interrupts their sleep.

217
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.300
We can't be having teenagers who have interrupted sleep that there's just no

218
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:47.440
benefit from that.

219
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.910
<v 1>Gave my daughter a fitbit,
my 10 year old to a monitor,</v>

220
00:12:51.911 --> 00:12:53.530
all sorts of different things.
She was interested in it.

221
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:56.360
So we got her one for Christmas and um,

222
00:12:56.470 --> 00:13:00.430
she slept five and a half hours the first night she had it on cause we could

223
00:13:00.431 --> 00:13:03.810
check.
We're like,
what are you doing?
She's checking the fifth is what,
what is,

224
00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:06.910
what's going on?
And I'm like,
this is not good.
Like you can't wear this now.

225
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.820
And she's like trying to make all these arguments to keep,
but I'm like,
listen,

226
00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.820
she goes,
it's not distracting me.
I go,
if it's not distracting you,

227
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:15.430
then you shouldn't care if you don't have it on right.

228
00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.840
Because then it's not going to mean anything.

229
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.790
And then there's like this like a shit.

230
00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:23.470
Like she got checkmated that's right now because these things are so attractive,

231
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:26.950
so addictive.
I had one of those goddamn watches,
those apple watches.

232
00:13:26.951 --> 00:13:30.370
I had it on for one day and while I was doing the podcast,
it kept vibrating.

233
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:34.300
I'm like,
Oh my God,
I'm getting text messages on my wrist,
my wrist.
Yeah.

234
00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:39.370
<v 0>So great.
And your brain is all developed,
but you're an adult.
Sketchy.
Okay.</v>

235
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.810
But imagine if you're a 10 or 11 year old kid.
I've seen it.
Yeah.

236
00:13:42.811 --> 00:13:44.550
You put something out there and you want to know.

237
00:13:44.551 --> 00:13:46.620
Did you know did bill like it yet?
You know,
why did,

238
00:13:46.621 --> 00:13:50.070
why did Mary like bills but not like so.
So that's rule number one.

239
00:13:50.071 --> 00:13:52.030
You gotta get devices out of the bedroom.
Yeah.

240
00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:54.390
Give them an old fashioned alarm clock.
Let him wake up with an alarm cuts.

241
00:13:54.391 --> 00:13:58.110
One to no social media till high school.

242
00:13:58.111 --> 00:14:01.860
There is no reason why kids in middle school or elementary school should have

243
00:14:01.861 --> 00:14:05.610
Instagram,
Facebook,
snapchat,
any of those.
I agree.
They can text each other.

244
00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.500
Like when we were kids,
he'd call each other on the phone is fine.

245
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:08.423
They can text each other.

246
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:11.750
But there should be no social media till high school cause it's a,

247
00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.640
it's a social dilemma.
It that we can't solve alone.

248
00:14:14.641 --> 00:14:18.360
We can only solve it if there's an agreement among parents and guidance from the

249
00:14:18.361 --> 00:14:21.000
principal.
Please parents don't give your kid in Instagram.
Yeah.

250
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.870
<v 1>My only concern is that they're not going to learn how to mitigate it or how to</v>

251
00:14:24.871 --> 00:14:25.381
navigate it.

252
00:14:25.381 --> 00:14:29.940
Rather if we say nothing till high school and then when they get into high

253
00:14:29.941 --> 00:14:32.580
school then they,
they're confronted with it.

254
00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:36.690
I would like them to have some skills or at least some understanding of what's

255
00:14:36.691 --> 00:14:37.600
going on now.
Wait

256
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:42.100
<v 0>a sec.
So,
so I'm not saying don't let him have access to these machines.</v>

257
00:14:42.101 --> 00:14:44.410
I'm not saying don't let them know.
I know exactly what you're saying.

258
00:14:44.411 --> 00:14:48.220
You're allowed to have social media.
And how about this?
Um,

259
00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:52.790
the bullying that takes place in middle school is primitive and destructive.

260
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:53.510
Uh,

261
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:56.910
and the bullying that takes place in late high school is a lot less and is not

262
00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:59.050
the same way.
Well,

263
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:02.710
mills like middle school kids are just coming into this.
Um,

264
00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:07.130
there's some research on Jean [inaudible] has a book called ign and she has some

265
00:15:07.131 --> 00:15:11.060
data in there that suggests that when you get social media in college,

266
00:15:11.061 --> 00:15:14.990
it doesn't seem to harm you,
but when you got it and your preteen years it does.

267
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:19.250
And so,
and she thinks that it's in part,
the nature of the bullying is such,
um,

268
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:22.250
so you know,
sure,
we want them to know how to deal with this,
but you know,

269
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:25.040
they can learn it pretty quickly when they're 15.

270
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.620
It's not like they need a running start from 11 to 15.

271
00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:33.010
So I just see no good whatsoever coming from social media in middle school and I

272
00:15:33.501 --> 00:15:37.100
see a lot of harm.
If you want your,
I go around the country and talk about this.

273
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.430
The almost the rule now is when someone in someone says,
oh,

274
00:15:40.431 --> 00:15:42.950
well my daughter's in high school and you know she's had it and I say,

275
00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.610
how she doing?
Does she have anxiety problems?
The answer's almost always yes,

276
00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.080
and if it's not her,

277
00:15:48.081 --> 00:15:51.170
then her friends are all crippled by or suffering from anxiety.

278
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.380
So I think we have to,
you know,
you have to wake costs and benefits.

279
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:58.460
A few years ago we didn't know for sure about the costs.
Now we do.
Yeah.
No,

280
00:15:58.461 --> 00:15:59.540
you're making total sense.

281
00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:02.780
I'm purely playing devil's advocate and I'm on the same page with you.

282
00:16:02.781 --> 00:16:05.840
I don't give,
my kids don't have phones and my 10 year old,

283
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:09.980
it's shocking how many girls in her class of phones and Facebook accounts and

284
00:16:09.981 --> 00:16:12.530
Instagram accounts and they,
I'll say it right now,

285
00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:17.090
her friends are at higher risk than she is of having an anxiety disorder of

286
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:20.360
being hospitalized because they're going to cut themselves and ultimately of

287
00:16:20.361 --> 00:16:21.110
suicide.
Yeah.

288
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:25.670
It's so common and it's most of the kids in school now and when they get older

289
00:16:25.671 --> 00:16:29.870
than 10,
the,
the number increases.
Like parents hold out for as long as they can,

290
00:16:29.871 --> 00:16:34.070
but as they get older and the kids want phones,
man,
everybody wants a phones.

291
00:16:34.071 --> 00:16:36.710
Right?
So let me put in a plug.
So I gave my son,

292
00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.540
I'm saying two contradictory things.

293
00:16:38.541 --> 00:16:40.280
One is I'm saying we've got to let her kids out,

294
00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:43.400
got to start letting them at least by age eight at least to go with their

295
00:16:43.401 --> 00:16:46.680
friends to play ground and stores.
We've got to start doing this.
Um,

296
00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:50.450
and at the same time I'm saying that the technology has some negative effects.

297
00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.790
Okay.
If you're going to send your kid out,

298
00:16:52.791 --> 00:16:55.610
I totally get what you were saying about your panic.

299
00:16:55.611 --> 00:16:58.640
Like the first time that we let her sign out in the park and,

300
00:16:58.641 --> 00:17:01.830
and he didn't come home right when he said like,
and it was real panic.
Um,

301
00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.320
and part,
so the two things,

302
00:17:03.321 --> 00:17:05.510
one is we have to get used to that because he always does come home.

303
00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:09.810
But secondly,
I didn't realize this when I gave him an iPhone.
My old iPhone,
um,

304
00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:13.400
there's a great little product.
The,
uh,
uh,
I'm not,
I don't know if horizon,
no,

305
00:17:13.401 --> 00:17:17.990
they don't make it.
It's,
I think LG makes it,
but it's a Gizmo or Gizmo gadget.
Uh,

306
00:17:17.991 --> 00:17:21.380
and so it's a simple,
it's a watch.
It's a,
it's,
it's a big clunky thing,

307
00:17:21.381 --> 00:17:24.590
but my daughter loves wearing it because it's kind of like a James Bond Dick

308
00:17:24.591 --> 00:17:27.890
Tracy thing.
It's a watch.
You press a button,
you turn it on,

309
00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:30.980
you can call three phone numbers.
That's it.
Three phone calls so she can call.

310
00:17:30.981 --> 00:17:34.100
And so now I can send it out to get bagels on Sunday morning.

311
00:17:34.101 --> 00:17:37.550
She walks about six blocks in New York City.
It's incredibly safe.
How old is she?

312
00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:41.600
She is nine.
So,
yeah.
So,
um,
uh,

313
00:17:41.601 --> 00:17:44.930
and she is a much more independent,
confident girl because of it.

314
00:17:44.931 --> 00:17:48.560
And she is proud of this fact that she is a free range kid.

315
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:51.510
She can walk around our neighborhood.
I mean,
we live in Greenwich Village.

316
00:17:51.511 --> 00:17:55.860
It's incredibly safe.
Um,
so she can go get bagels and it,
you know,

317
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.480
she has no sense of direction.

318
00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:59.880
So a couple of times when she's been out doing an errand,
she gets lost.

319
00:17:59.881 --> 00:18:02.370
She just presses a button.
Daddy,
I don't know where I am.

320
00:18:02.371 --> 00:18:06.420
And if she's calm and I talk it through and I can track her,
that's the,

321
00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:10.380
the reassuring thing.
I can see on a screen roughly where she is.
So I can say,

322
00:18:10.381 --> 00:18:12.090
you know,
what do you see?
And I said,
I'll come back this way.

323
00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.550
And she always knows if she gets in trouble,
just walk home and start again.

324
00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:19.130
What are you thinking,
Joe?
Why?
What's,

325
00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.580
what's that facial expression for that thing?

326
00:18:20.581 --> 00:18:24.810
It's just children wandering around on their own.
Yeah.
That has always happened.

327
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:28.320
And as they have to do at some point,
I know,
but listen,

328
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:32.010
look at how you're even reacting to this and what you're,
you're,

329
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:36.060
you're beaming up and you're adding emotion to your voice and you're smiling is

330
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:37.950
as though it's,
everything's going to be fine.

331
00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:41.640
Everything you're doing this in a sort of,
you're not just reassuring.

332
00:18:41.641 --> 00:18:43.230
You're selling it.
You're right.

333
00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:48.320
I am selling it because we as a society bought into a set of beliefs that are

334
00:18:48.871 --> 00:18:52.650
based on false hoods.
The risk to our kids is minuscule.

335
00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.400
Someone calculated at present rates of abduction by strangers.

336
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:59.460
If you put your kid in a car and you go into a store and you leave the windows

337
00:18:59.461 --> 00:19:01.500
open,
your kid sitting there in the parking lot,

338
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:06.900
you'd have to stay in that store for 700,000 years before your kid is likely to

339
00:19:06.901 --> 00:19:09.180
be abducted.
Well it does not depend on what neighborhood you live in.

340
00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:14.070
I suppose so,
but still the point is that there's hardly any actual abduction.

341
00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.380
And so actually it's,
this brings up a really important point.
I'd like to say,
um,

342
00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:18.140
you,

343
00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.510
one of the sticking points here is that we're afraid to let our kids out because

344
00:19:21.511 --> 00:19:24.270
bad things can happen to us as well as to the kids.

345
00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:28.440
And so I would hope that would be the least of your concerns are what number one

346
00:19:28.441 --> 00:19:29.970
concern would be your children's safety.

347
00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.970
But then you getting in trouble for that hope would be the least of your

348
00:19:32.971 --> 00:19:37.050
concerns,
not the least of them.
Because I am selling something,

349
00:19:37.051 --> 00:19:39.850
I'm selling the idea that,
that the,

350
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:44.370
the gigantic rise in mental illness of teenagers is caused in part because
we've,

351
00:19:44.371 --> 00:19:47.730
oh,
protected them.
We have denied them the experiences of independence.

352
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:50.520
They need to develop their basic social sense.

353
00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:52.590
And so I am selling an idea that we've,

354
00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.680
we've totally botched this and we need to undo it.

355
00:19:56.430 --> 00:20:00.390
And a big piece of that is we need to be removed from the fear of legal

356
00:20:00.391 --> 00:20:04.830
prosecution.
And so Utah,
the State of Utah passed a year and a half ago,

357
00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:08.730
a year ago.
Yeah.
They passed the first free range kids bill,

358
00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:13.920
which says it puts into state law.
It says,
uh,
I forget what the exact terms,

359
00:20:13.921 --> 00:20:18.921
but the gist of it is a parent cannot be considered to be negligent just by

360
00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:23.010
having the kids be unsupervised.
So if you send your kids out to the park,

361
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:26.370
you know,
you have to use judge.
Obviously if there's a pattern of neglect,

362
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.190
that's a totally different story.
But the mere fact that as you just said,

363
00:20:29.191 --> 00:20:31.710
the story about what I'm teaching my kids to go outside,

364
00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.590
I know that they're outside.
I told them to go outside.

365
00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:38.040
You can't be arrested for that.
And until we have legal protections,

366
00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:42.630
it's can be very hard for anyone to do it because they,
you know,

367
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:46.740
the risk is you could be drawn into months and months of supervision.

368
00:20:46.741 --> 00:20:49.870
Your kids can actually be taken away from you if you give them independence in

369
00:20:49.871 --> 00:20:50.770
some parts of the country.

370
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:55.480
It's interesting that Utah would be so progressive about that.
Um,
yeah.

371
00:20:55.481 --> 00:20:57.850
I don't know the history behind it.
Such a safe place.

372
00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:00.270
It's one of the reasons why.
Thank [inaudible] yeah.

373
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:03.920
So a big part of this that we don't trust each other anymore.
Um,
you know,
if,

374
00:21:03.921 --> 00:21:08.110
if you don't trust your neighbors,
then you're,
you're not gonna let them out.

375
00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:09.130
You're not let your kids out.
