1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.940
We were talking about how weird it was to meet Mike Tyson.

2
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.050
It's so strange to hang out and talk to them like party.

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.160
He was so iconic that whenever you're around them part there's like 10% of you

4
00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:15.600
that has to go holy shit.
It's Mike Tyson.
No matter what else you're saying,

5
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.260
10% of your brain is going.
Holy Shit.
That's Mike Tyson.

6
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.680
When you showed the clip of the 51 year old Mike Tyson and hitting the bag,

7
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.690
I remember it as a child.
He was the first person I see.
I have two dads.

8
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:31.560
I have a non bio on the Bio Dad and I,
he was the first person I

9
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.130
say he hit with such vicious and evil intent.
It was amazing.

10
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.410
He could still do it.
Yeah.
That's what I saw him.

11
00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:42.780
He was in the bag like he's still terrifying.
Yeah.

12
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.060
If he was a young contender coming up,
you would look at him and go,
wow,

13
00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:46.410
this guy getting punch.
Yeah.

14
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.080
He doesn't have nearly the hand speed that he had when he was young.

15
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.470
Look at that man.
Yeah.
That was the peak.

16
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.650
He is an amazing story though,
man.

17
00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.480
Listening to him describe his childhood and how custom motto had hypnotized him.

18
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.690
Yeah,
that was amazing because I'd never heard him talk about that before.

19
00:01:03.691 --> 00:01:07.950
And that's what people need to understand.
Like who he was.
He people want to say,

20
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.813
oh he was,

21
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.470
he was hyper aggressive and he did terrible things and he was violent in this.

22
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.510
Think of how this kid grew up.
How's it forfeit?
Yes.

23
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.940
Literally or taken in by this one guy,

24
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:23.940
the first time in his life where anything is positive and it's all about

25
00:01:23.941 --> 00:01:27.150
fighting and being a destroyer and he gets hypnotized by this guy to be a

26
00:01:27.151 --> 00:01:31.170
destroyer and he's a physical specimen.
He really is.
You put your hand,

27
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.170
will you grab his?
Just his hand,
like his whole body is like carved out of a,

28
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.600
a large block of rock.
He's a tank of a man.
Wow.
You know,

29
00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:43.320
still to this day he's a tank.
Absolutely.
And when he was young,

30
00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:44.400
they saw that right away,

31
00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:49.401
Teddy Alison on this podcast that when Mike was 13 weigh 290 pounds and they

32
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:52.320
didn't believe he was 13 they thought we were sandbagging.
They,

33
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.690
they put them in at 16 he said,
yeah,
okay,

34
00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:58.140
say 16 nobody would believe he's 13 and they would come on,

35
00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.550
you're shining these fucking kids to,

36
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.730
they didn't want to believe it and he just let him have it.
Okay,
okay.

37
00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:03.091
You don't have it.

38
00:02:03.091 --> 00:02:06.090
Because he said people were always lying about how many fights people had.

39
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.550
They would always say he's only had 10 fights and you see the guy move

40
00:02:08.551 --> 00:02:11.940
immediately.
I'm like,
Oh my God,
this guy's had 50 fights watching him,

41
00:02:11.941 --> 00:02:13.980
and teddy was saying that that was always the hustle,

42
00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:17.040
that everybody always lied a little bit about someone's record and when they saw

43
00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:17.611
Mike Tyson,

44
00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:22.611
it 13 when 190 pounds just dope fucking specimen is some people that are just

45
00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:27.090
built perfect for certain things.

46
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.910
He was built to be this built perfect for bobbing and weaving and tight and he

47
00:02:32.911 --> 00:02:37.070
was so fucking fast.
His Hook and uppercut.

48
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.530
I,
what's fighter has that upper cut?

49
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.490
Like the Lennox Lewis had a tremendous upper cut.
Eh,
there's,

50
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:49.020
there's some fighters today.
Joshua has a tremendous upper upper cut.
Yeah,

51
00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:52.770
there's some,
there's some amazing talent today,

52
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.040
but it's like what Mike had done was revitalize the entire country's image of

53
00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:04.660
the heavyweight division.
Yeah.
Cause [inaudible] for awhile and no disrespect,

54
00:03:04.661 --> 00:03:07.870
but there was guys that just like pink when Thomas who's a champion and Tony

55
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:08.380
tubs,

56
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.830
they weren't the kind of guy that you like look forward to seeing as being the

57
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:13.180
champion of the world.
He didn't believe it.

58
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.980
Like I don't believe that's the toughest guy in the world.

59
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.040
It might be a tough guy.
I'm sure he's a tough guy.
He's a professional boxer,

60
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:19.300
but I don't think that's the best guy.

61
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.830
And then Tyson came along very is perfect name.
He had the perfect look.

62
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:27.510
He had the perfect body,
the perfect image and he came at the perfect time.
Yup.

63
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.330
When you look at hip hop and where it was and where Mike was at that time,

64
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.500
it was a perfect synergy for him to become a hero.
Mike Tyson.

65
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.611
Mike Jordan.

66
00:03:36.611 --> 00:03:41.140
Like these people became icon is at a time where the United States,

67
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.390
like in the 80s after getting opaque kicking ass and the debt crisis fucking up

68
00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:50.900
the 70s our ranch shit at the end of the seventies early eighties I steel armor,

69
00:03:50.901 --> 00:03:52.330
my grandfather worked at hall steel,

70
00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:56.110
remember steal my other grandfather steel leaving America.

71
00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:58.720
I remember like it just kind of being like,

72
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.260
it wasn't as proud and he was one of those things that may you feel bad ass and

73
00:04:05.981 --> 00:04:10.420
the Times feel dangerous and he wore black and those little boxes and you didn't

74
00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:11.770
wear the boots.
He wasn't flashy.

75
00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:16.270
Like he was a perfect villain at a time where Villainy Nwa,

76
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.630
you know what I'm saying?
It was was celebrated danger.

77
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.470
I think he was perfect for the time and I think he's perfectly now like what

78
00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:27.340
Mike is when I hear him interview and I really talk and people make fun of his

79
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:31.450
list,
but whatever,
and I think that gets a new way of you hearing a real wisdom.

80
00:04:31.451 --> 00:04:35.830
He saying a lot of times it's like Mike is repeatedly talked about change and

81
00:04:35.831 --> 00:04:38.890
about growth and about how he doesn't see things the same.

82
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.140
And I think if we actually listened to that,

83
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.040
it kind of challenged us to do the same shit that we really don't want to do.

84
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.511
Yeah.
He's a,

85
00:04:45.511 --> 00:04:48.940
one of the rare guys that you'll talk to that accomplished an insane amount,

86
00:04:48.941 --> 00:04:52.870
literally became one of the most famous boxers in the history of the sport.

87
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.800
And you talk about him now and all he wants to do is dismiss that past life.

88
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.210
He went to,
he like,
I was,
uh,
I was silly.
Look,
uh,
look at me.
I'm a silly person.

89
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.060
Like,
he's a real warrior.
Like he's,
he's,
he's,

90
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.350
he is like in a classic come fulfilled.
He's the reluctant teacher almost.

91
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.420
You know,
he's,
you know,
you do,
you do,
you,
you know,
you do a,
you do a movie.

92
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:16.930
Mike is the guy who used a student go to beg to teach you to fight and you've

93
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:17.550
won.

94
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.530
You want to know why he won't teach you in this because you find out later your

95
00:05:20.531 --> 00:05:22.840
teacher killed someone you know in the ring or some shit like he is.

96
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.260
He is really that character.
He is a,
he's,

97
00:05:26.261 --> 00:05:31.090
you can tell even with the pigeons back in the days that there's kindness and

98
00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:35.860
love in there somewhere.
Yeah.
And now he gets to express it to human beings.

99
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.410
You just see he's a happier person.
You know what I mean?

100
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.650
Until you bring up don king's name.
Yeah.
Don't do that.
Yeah.
And then,

101
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.120
then you get scared.
Like he's going to fucking beat me up.
And my dad too.
He,

102
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.680
the crazy thing about him selling weed now is that he,
they charge,

103
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.870
what did they charge him?
$300,000 I think for,

104
00:05:52.871 --> 00:05:55.720
he tested positive for the Andrew Gelada fight for weed.

105
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.640
So they find him $300,000.

106
00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:01.360
They just stole money from him cause he had weed in his system.
Wow.

107
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.140
Now he sells weed.
When did I go on my NFL guys?

108
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.610
They should let everybody smoke it.
It's good for your brain if you're,
if you're,

109
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.160
especially if you're doing something like slamming into each other,

110
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:14.550
running 30 miles an hour.
Yeah.

111
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.240
It's probably good to give them something to calm them down.
Yeah.
