00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.070
There's a,
there's a weird ideology that they're attached to that is,

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.200
it's,
it's,
it's not tenable.
It's not,
you can't argue it,

3
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.520
you know,
the idea of ethical treatment of animals,
I'm 100% with that.

4
00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:18.510
I fucking hate the whole idea of captive orchids.

5
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.410
That to me is one of the big rows that freaks me the fuck out.

6
00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:27.180
That we can take these alien creatures that are essentially as smart as us

7
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.900
probably,
and put him in swimming pools and justify it.

8
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.040
And that the only time they've ever killed people in recorded history has been

9
00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:37.800
in those swimming pools.
They don't kill people in the wild.

10
00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:40.680
They kill everything else.
They killed whales,
they killed dolphins,

11
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.470
they kill sharks.
They don't fuck with people.
In fact,

12
00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:48.150
there's been instances where they've saved people and yet we've decided to put

13
00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:50.940
those.
So me and Peter are on the hundred percent,
the same page as that.

14
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.910
Pete has retweeted a bunch of shit that I've put up before,

15
00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:57.660
which is really weird.
They retweeted a bunch of shit that I've put up about,

16
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.580
you know,
about,
uh,
orcas.
And when I've done that,
people like,
uh,
you know,

17
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:07.420
he hunts,
right.
And then,
then it gets,
you know,
radio silence,
you know,

18
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.920
they don't want to comment on that.
They just want to support my hate for,

19
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.060
you know,
Orca Kevin.

20
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.910
<v 1>Yeah.
You know,
I had,
um,
one of the most,
I've had some,</v>

21
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.380
I've been fortunate to have remarkable engagements with wildlife in my life.

22
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.250
But two years ago in NBC,
I had one with a killer whale.
And it was,

23
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.520
it was wicked.
And to this day,

24
00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:31.750
I regret not making the decision I'm about to tell you about,
but we had been,

25
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.070
um,
I'd been bear hunting on the coast and we were in a boat cruising back to the

26
00:01:36.071 --> 00:01:39.580
harbor and we found two pods of killer whales,
uh,

27
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.850
three big bowls and a bunch of cows that were hunting.
And,
uh,

28
00:01:42.851 --> 00:01:44.410
we kept as they would come up,

29
00:01:44.411 --> 00:01:46.240
they were chasing salmon and as they would come up,

30
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.500
we've just get closer just to film them or even just to see them and then they'd

31
00:01:50.501 --> 00:01:52.240
go down.
And so,

32
00:01:52.241 --> 00:01:55.540
I don't know if it was just happenstance of where we were,

33
00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.010
but we came up and we were just kind of waiting for the whole pod to come up and

34
00:02:00.011 --> 00:02:02.830
all of a sudden,
just 50 feet from the boat.

35
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.880
Here comes the huge dorsal fin of this bowl,
comes right at our boat,

36
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.650
bumps into our boat.
I'm standing on the,
in the crow's nest,

37
00:02:11.651 --> 00:02:14.650
essentially I'm on the roof of the boat looking at this saying he comes up,

38
00:02:14.651 --> 00:02:19.651
bumps into our boat and he just glides his left side all along the boat.

39
00:02:19.811 --> 00:02:24.811
So his left pectoral fin is probably under our gunnel,

40
00:02:24.821 --> 00:02:26.260
if you will,
or under our hall.

41
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.400
And so he's just dragging his Finn and he rotates on his side,

42
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.690
dragging his dorsal fin along our side exhales covering,

43
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.200
I'm our director of photography Williams face in his spray.

44
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.570
And as he's doing this,
he goes,

45
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.550
he hugs the bowel of our boat and he never ever breaks eye contact with me.

46
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.340
He's staring at me out of his left eye,

47
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.050
literally rolling his eye over and he just cruises all the way around the boat.

48
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.250
And,
uh,
I wanted to dive in and I just wasn't sure.

49
00:02:57.251 --> 00:03:00.350
Like I didn't want to be one of these,
you got to die.

50
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.990
I didn't want to be the first guy to diet.

51
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.640
And I also didn't want to have like some sort of shallow water blackout because

52
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:09.580
the water was so cold.
So I didn't want to dive in and have all of a sudden,

53
00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:13.510
like I didn't know how my body would react cause I hadn't been in the water yet.

54
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:16.330
And so,
um,
and then also I was like,
I,
you know,

55
00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:19.810
I'd watched black fish or whatever that film is really killed a bunch of folks

56
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:23.860
that you know,
in,
in a seaworld and in NBC.
And so I was just like,
well,

57
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.800
what if you know,
there's gotta be at first,
you know,

58
00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:29.470
wolves never killed anyone any either.
And then,
you know,

59
00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:33.820
some young lady went jogging and BC and son of a bitch.
We have number one.
Well,

60
00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:36.900
there's a long history of will's coop killing people though in the past.

61
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.480
I'm just saying,
you know,
like,
you know,
in recorded time,
but it was still,
it was,

62
00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:41.210
it was a,

63
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.830
and he maintained eye contact turned and then just continued on with the hunt.

64
00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:47.880
But it was the film all this,
well,

65
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.530
you filmed as much as we could because it happened really fast.
But yeah,

66
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.300
it was wicked.
Absolutely wicked.
I mean,
literally his,
you know,

67
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.820
his dorsal fins probably 10 feet tall and it is just,
you know,

68
00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:02.680
when you drag something against another on in an object with force,
you know,

69
00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:04.100
it's vintage.
You know,

70
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.370
he was just very engaged with the boat as a dorsal fin.
Really?
That tall.

71
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.720
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's like,
it's gotta be eight,
nine,
10 feet.

72
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.520
That's fucking crazy.
Yeah,

73
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.080
<v 0>I guess it makes sense.
They're so big.
Fuck man.
I've never seen one in the wall.</v>

74
00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:22.360
I've seen dolphins in the wall and I've seen whales in the wild.

75
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.210
I've never seen an Orca.
Yeah.
Their weight,
I mean wicked animals.
We don't even,

76
00:04:26.211 --> 00:04:27.980
we can't even comprehend what that animal's head,

77
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.690
that if orchids weren't real and big foot was real,

78
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.370
we wouldn't give a shit about big foot,

79
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.100
big foot who'd be in the zoo right next to the fucking orangutans.
You know,

80
00:04:37.101 --> 00:04:41.890
we'd be like,
look at the big monkey,
stupid monkey,
you know?
Yeah.
But orcas,

81
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.610
I mean,
they speak in a language that we can't decipher.

82
00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:48.250
We don't know what they're saying,
but we know that they have dialects.

83
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.090
We know that they stay in these pods for life.
They,
they,

84
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.110
they have this family organization and they all stay in their clan there.

85
00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.270
They're fucking incredible.
And you've seen,
you've seen black fish,
obviously.

86
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.360
Yeah.
I,
as much as I could watch,
I could watch the whole thing and I get angry.

87
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.830
I get,
I get furious that this is a giant business,

88
00:05:08.831 --> 00:05:12.850
that they take these things and they buy them from other organizations.

89
00:05:12.851 --> 00:05:17.560
And I've had,
you know,
I just,
I've had real problems with it for a long time.

90
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.810
And,
um,
I felt my friend Phil Demars,
he was a,

91
00:05:20.811 --> 00:05:24.550
a a trainer at marine land and he's been on the podcast many,

92
00:05:24.551 --> 00:05:28.930
many times and he's involved in these constant lawsuits with Bahrain land.
Um,

93
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.890
he was a walrus trainer and he also trained killer whales and you know,

94
00:05:32.891 --> 00:05:37.891
he's given us some real insight into the horrors of what it's like in marine

95
00:05:37.961 --> 00:05:40.540
land and even in seaworld and what they're doing and how they,

96
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.390
how they get these orchids and,

97
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.390
and how they're treated and how bad it is for them to be trapped in these

98
00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:50.230
environments and how their dorsal fins go limp because they never have to deal

99
00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:54.140
with current.
So the atrophy,
the whole thing,
it's sick.
It's sick.

100
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.160
Do they still have them now and killer whales at sea world now?
Yes.
Yeah,

101
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.380
they still have them.
Yeah,
they,
they,
they can't,

102
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.860
they can't buy new ones apparently or something like that.
There's some weird,

103
00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:06.040
fantastic,
yeah,
the whole thing.
They can't,

104
00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.420
they think they could still breed them though.
I mean,

105
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:12.020
the whole thing is fucked up,
man.
It's,
it's just like slavery.

106
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.680
If like we had aliens as slaves,
we just couldn't.
We were like,

107
00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:18.010
what are you saying?
Uh,
yeah.
I don't know what you're saying,
dude.

108
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.320
Get in the pool.
If you want to fish it,
getting the fucking pool.
I mean,

109
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:25.430
that's basically what's going on.
It's gross.
Yeah,
it's,
it's sick.
It's twisted,

110
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.130
you know?
And I just,
uh,

111
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.100
so that's where me and Pete were on the same page.
