1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.280
I guess DC when I'm broken head.
No,
no,
no.

2
00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:05.190
He beat somebody in a very impressive fight.
Oh,

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.280
it was Roy who's big country.
Oh yeah.
I took it down.
He kept,
he kept taking down.

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.080
Yeah.
That was it.
That was a long,

5
00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:15.780
the shit out of Roy could beat the shit out of Roy and it was a long fight.

6
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:18.410
Right?
Wasn't it like a five rounds?
Uh,
I don't know if it's five.

7
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.870
It was three rounds of an ass whooping though.
See if you find that is a monster.

8
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:24.180
He's a bad motherfucker.
He's a bad mother to help him.

9
00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:27.630
And frankly the most cerebral,
I think.
Thank you.
Got clipped with a punch before.

10
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.260
Main advantage.
Oh Wow.
I'm impressed.

11
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.360
He does look very fit.
Who?
So he must've been heavy when he started camp.

12
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.790
Since world,
he's really heavy.
That's what it,
he didn't fight for a little bit.

13
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.940
So you know,
he's been commentating and find a Russian ship.
Interesting.
Here.

14
00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:46.380
Here we go.
This is only three rounds.
They don't do five round main event.

15
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:50.220
So only title fights.
Here we go.
Can you,
what do you think about that?

16
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.820
I kind of agree with that.
Yeah.
I'm not mad at it.
I like five rounds.

17
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.870
Three rounds.
It goes too quick.
I like five rounds for smaller weight classes.

18
00:00:57.871 --> 00:01:02.340
So good point.
My,
my thing would be,
man,
the five round fights are beatings,
man.

19
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.280
I mean,
you really,
oh,
it's over.
Oh,
it's over here.
Clipped him clover.
Oh,

20
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.710
trouble.
Oh,
he's surviving now.
Whoa.

21
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.500
Take down.
He did frank.
He didn't have the under hook right there again.

22
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.710
That's why frank stood up.
Oh,

23
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.530
barges.
Throw.
Oh holy.
Oh,
I was gonna be a quick one.

24
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.650
I thought I was going to be a decision.
Yes.
This is phenomenal.

25
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.060
If it's on finch.
Oh.
Oh Shit.
Oh Shit.

26
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.840
It's over.
That's it.
Oh Dang.

27
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.380
What a war.
Dance.

28
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.020
<v 1>Woo.</v>

29
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.470
<v 0>Oh Wow.
You ready for this fade or chill?
Sewn in snacks.</v>

30
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.500
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Yeah.

31
00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.780
That's really fun.
That's fucking code stacking to happen.
Wow.

32
00:01:59.781 --> 00:02:03.790
Frank Mirrors.
You know,
and he almost had him,
almost had him.

33
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.030
It was a great throat.
That is a great fuck fucking hip toss,
Huh?

34
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.800
That was beautiful.
Autumn.
Some time dude fade or chail sewn in.

35
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.910
Wow.

36
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.090
When was the last time fade or one melody Denato but he really lost and Russia

37
00:02:19.091 --> 00:02:23.470
lost.
Yeah,
he got hurt.
Not Fun.
Yeah,
that was crazy flat.

38
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.640
I forgot about that one.
Yeah,
let's,
I agree one that he wanted,
but he lost it.

39
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.760
So let's,
let's take those in Russia,
right?
Yes.

40
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.840
Let's take that one out of the equation.
He she damn,
that's right.

41
00:02:35.841 --> 00:02:37.730
So Toshi was his last fight.

42
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.050
His retirement fight in his last run and then decided to come back after that.

43
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.650
I'll do this
please.

44
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.210
All wild and loose.
Huh?
Boom.
Wait,
the left both hands down.

45
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.160
Damn.
What cloud?
Just must be oh,
right there.
The left hand.
Right on the chin.

46
00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.880
Oh boom.
Boom.
Crazy hard.
Just swinging.

47
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:04.720
They're swinging wild.
Just going.
Oh Shit.

48
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.170
I feel like he caught them earlier than that too,
but just that was the,

49
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.880
that was the big one.
The one that really hurt him.
Perfect stoppage.

50
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.800
God Damn,
there it is.
Oh,
it was the left.
Perfect left hand.

51
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.860
That was nice.
It was crazy.

52
00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:24.250
This is fate or his first win in take out the Maldonado fight.

53
00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:27.520
She's how many years then?
How many years?
It's been a rough go for my man.

54
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.480
When was he?
She,
he felt beat seeing GI deep,
all that chocolate.

55
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.150
That was shit.
Fight my brain.
My brain goes,
no,
that was when 15 new year's eve.

56
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:41.050
2015 you also be Pedro his though on January 21st,

57
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.940
2012 that was 2012 that was after the issue was 2012 oh yeah,

58
00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:48.880
