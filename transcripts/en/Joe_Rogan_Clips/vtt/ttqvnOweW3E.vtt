1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.080
Well,
you know,

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.530
one of the things that I have made a mistake about in the past that I just

3
00:00:04.531 --> 00:00:07.440
realized in the last couple of weeks was that,
you know,

4
00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:10.080
people often accused me and they say,
well,

5
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.040
most of the people that listen to you are men.
And I think that,
you know,

6
00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:16.730
when you're accused like that your automatic responses,

7
00:00:16.731 --> 00:00:19.200
while you wouldn't be accused if you weren't doing something wrong,

8
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.650
so the must be something wrong about that.
It's like,
why isn't it 50% women?

9
00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:24.630
And so I've said things like,
well,
you know,

10
00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:27.330
80% of the people who watch youtube videos are man.

11
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.830
And so the fact that 80% of the people who watch my videos are men.

12
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.840
Isn't that surprising given that base rate?

13
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.070
But then about three weeks ago I started thinking,
well,
what the hell am I doing?

14
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:40.350
It's like,
what?
Is there something wrong with talking to men?

15
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.530
Is that actually a problem?
So like I'm trying to,
I'm trying,

16
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.380
I mean I didn't set out to do that specifically,

17
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:48.050
but if that's the way it's working out and,

18
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.710
and there is a majority of men coming to my shows say then is that,

19
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.750
why is that all of a sudden supposed to be a bad thing?
I'm asking men to,

20
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.990
you know,
to be more honest and in,

21
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.710
especially in their speech and their thinking and to be more responsible for

22
00:01:04.711 --> 00:01:09.210
themselves and for their family and for their community and to grow up and to

23
00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:12.690
shoulder their burden and to live a responsible and meaningful life and putting

24
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:14.880
those two things together conceptually.
And it's like,

25
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.120
and then there's an accusation about that as if there's something wrong.

26
00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:21.720
And I thought,
well,
why am I even playing into this?
It's like,
fine,

27
00:01:21.721 --> 00:01:25.590
I'm talking to men,
I'm encouraging them and I am absolutely thrilled.

28
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.760
Like every time someone comes up to me,
um,
and that's happening,

29
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.470
I may be a hundred times a week or something like that and tells me one of these

30
00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:36.390
stories about how they put their life together.
It's like,

31
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.110
I'm absolutely thrilled about that.
And so I don't see,

32
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.450
it's just a sign of how pathological our times have become in some sense that

33
00:01:45.451 --> 00:01:47.610
there would have been any guilt about that to begin with.

34
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.270
Because how was that not a good thing,
man?
It's weird.
Uh,
I think,
uh,

35
00:01:52.271 --> 00:01:56.160
a lot of that has to do with this concept that men are running everything and

36
00:01:56.161 --> 00:01:57.870
that men have this massive advantage.

37
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.430
There's a white male advantage and privilege that we all enjoy and share and

38
00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:06.450
that men have this advantage financially.
There's disparity in terms of the,

39
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.170
the gender gap in pay,
you know,
and,
and,
and income.

40
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.640
And that if you were really a good person,
you would be looking out.

41
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.600
He would be trying to balance that out and then you wouldn't be trying to pump

42
00:02:18.601 --> 00:02:21.990
up the winning team.
So this is where the,
well,
that's it.

43
00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:25.560
And that's part of that narrative that well,
if there's winners there,

44
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.910
there has to be losers.

45
00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:29.640
And the reason that there are losers is because there's winners.

46
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.150
And that's complete bloody nonsense because as far as I'm concerned that,

47
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.230
and I really believe this,

48
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:39.231
is that every single person who sets out to put themselves together ethically is

49
00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:43.720
a net positive to everyone around them.
There is no downside to that.
You know,

50
00:02:43.721 --> 00:02:47.310
and I,
my book has been criticized by people who've read it very poorly,

51
00:02:47.311 --> 00:02:49.920
especially chapter one when I talk about hierarchies,

52
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.430
that I'm somehow supporting the idea that power in a hierarchy is the right way

53
00:02:56.431 --> 00:02:57.420
to be.
And that's,

54
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.430
there's absolutely nothing in what I've written that suggest that at all.

55
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.080
I'm suggesting that human hierarchies are very complex and that the way that you

56
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:09.940
win in a human hierarchy is by being competent and reciprocal.

57
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.750
And so,
and so.
I mean,
for example,
even if you're selfish,

58
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:17.710
let's say you got to think very carefully about what that would mean if you are

59
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:22.711
selfish and awake because you have to work to take care of yourself and what you

60
00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:24.430
want say in this moment.

61
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.710
But then there's you tomorrow and there's you next week and there's you next

62
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.360
month,
next year,
and 10 years from now.
And when you're old.

63
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.470
So because you're self conscious and because you're aware of the future,

64
00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:40.090
you're actually a community unto yourself.
And if you're a selfish and impulsive,

65
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:43.600
all that means is that you're serving the person you are right now.

66
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.990
You know in that impulsive way but not the person you're going to be.

67
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.110
And so that's not a good grounds for any sort of ethical behavior.

68
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.200
And I see that if you serve yourself properly,

69
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.800
there is no difference between that and serving your family properly and serving

70
00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:57.880
your community properly.

71
00:03:57.881 --> 00:04:00.970
That those things all mesh in a kind of a harmonious manner.

72
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.650
And one of the things that's really been effective in the lecture tour is a

73
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:10.651
discussion about that idea and its relationship between the relationship between

74
00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:12.880
that and meaning and responsibility.

75
00:04:12.881 --> 00:04:17.881
Because one of the things that strikes the audience's silent constantly,

76
00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:20.050
cause I'm always listening to them to see,
you know,
when,

77
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.160
when the attention is maximally focused is whenever I point out to people that

78
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.960
the antidote to the meaninglessness of their life and the suffering and the

79
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:32.200
malevolence that they might be displaying because they're resentful and bitter

80
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:33.520
about how things have turned out.

81
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.630
The antidote to that is to take on more responsibility for themselves and for

82
00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:42.070
other people.
And that that's aspirational,
which is Kinda cool.
You know,

83
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.090
the conservative types,
the duty types,
and I'm not complaining about them,

84
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.500
you know,
they're always basically saying,
well this is how you should act.

85
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.930
Because in some sense that's your duty,
right?

86
00:04:52.931 --> 00:04:56.050
That's how a good citizen would act.
And that's a reasonable argument.

87
00:04:56.051 --> 00:05:00.180
But the case that I've been making is more that,
well there is a,

88
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.440
there is value distinctions between things.

89
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.560
Some things are worth doing and some things aren't.

90
00:05:05.561 --> 00:05:09.070
And you can kind of discover what that is for yourself and then you should aim

91
00:05:09.071 --> 00:05:10.900
at the things that are most worth doing.

92
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.630
And what you'll find if you watch carefully,

93
00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:18.631
is that the things that you find worth doing are almost always associated with

94
00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:22.930
an increase in responsibility.
Because if you think about the people you admire,

95
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.011
for example,

96
00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:27.700
you spontaneously admire people and that's a manifestation of the instinct.

97
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.340
Imitate.
Again,
people are very imitative.

98
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.040
You don't admire people who don't take care of themselves.

99
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.070
Like unless there's something wrong with you,
you,

100
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.520
you at least want an admirable person to be accountable for themselves.

101
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.790
And then if they've got something left over so they can be accountable for their

102
00:05:42.791 --> 00:05:44.740
family while then that's a net plus,

103
00:05:44.741 --> 00:05:48.520
obviously that's someone you think is solid and then maybe they take care of

104
00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:49.271
some more people.

105
00:05:49.271 --> 00:05:52.690
They have a business or they're involved in the community in some positive way.

106
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.591
You see,
well,

107
00:05:53.591 --> 00:05:58.010
that's a person who's pattern of being is worth imitating and so on.

108
00:05:58.011 --> 00:06:02.000
That's all associated with responsibility and it's so interesting because it's

109
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:05.450
as if it's as if everybody kind of knows this,

110
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:08.390
but that it hasn't crystallized.
It's like,
well,

111
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.960
you should be responsible because that's what a good citizen is.
It's not,
no,
no.

112
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.710
You should be responsible because you need to have a deep meaning in your life

113
00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:18.080
to offset the suffering so you don't get bitter.

114
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.320
And the way you do that is to bear a heavy load,
you know,

115
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.700
to get yourself in check for you now and for you in the future.

116
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:27.890
And then to do the same for your family and your community.

117
00:06:27.891 --> 00:06:31.250
And that there's real nobility in that and there's real meaning and more.

118
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:34.130
The other thing that I've been suggesting to people,
and I also believe this,

119
00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:36.980
is that,
and I think that the guys that have come to talk to me,

120
00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:39.350
especially the ones that have had real la real rough lives,

121
00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:40.400
they really understand this.

122
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.120
If you don't get your act together and you let yourself slide,

123
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.170
then what kind of moves in to take the place of what you could have been is

124
00:06:49.171 --> 00:06:50.930
something that's really not good at all.

125
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:55.040
So it's not only that if you're living a like a dissolute life,

126
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.850
that you're not aiming at anything positive and so you don't have any real

127
00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:02.180
meaning and you're subsumed by anxiety and all of that and hopelessness.

128
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.290
But something kind of hellish moves in there to,
to,
to occupy that place.

129
00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:09.590
And so then you end up making things worse.
And when,
you know,

130
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.130
one of the things I learned about studying totalitarian systems,

131
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.470
whether they were on the right or the left,

132
00:07:15.471 --> 00:07:19.610
was that part of the reason that the totalitarian horrors of the 20th century

133
00:07:19.611 --> 00:07:23.330
manifested themselves was because average people didn't take on the proper

134
00:07:23.331 --> 00:07:26.600
responsibility.
They shut their eyes when they're,
I should have been open,

135
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.640
even though they knew it and they did,

136
00:07:28.641 --> 00:07:30.800
and said things they knew they shouldn't have done and said,

137
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:34.610
and that was what supported those horrible systems.
So,
you know,

138
00:07:34.611 --> 00:07:37.550
if you don't get your act together,
then you leave a little space for hell.

139
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.170
And I really believe that.
