1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.980
As you know,
we were talking about earlier with your,
the way you do yours,

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.080
you used to use patrion and now you use your own website after the Sargon of a

3
00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:14.880
cod incident,
which,
you know,
he stepped back away from Patriot now or not.

4
00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:17.800
So no plate on what you think of starting on a mocad.
Yeah,
yeah.

5
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.400
Well it's not even that.
It's a,
yeah.
Yeah.

6
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.730
Well there's so many misconceptions about what happened there and I,

7
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.850
you know,
I tried to clear them up on my podcast,
but yeah,

8
00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:33.150
there's an interesting implication to not taking ads.
I mean,
I,

9
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.960
I think what's happening,
and this is much bigger than even podcasting,
I think,

10
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.950
um,
I'd be interested to know what you feel about this.
You have,
you are the,
the,

11
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.100
the quintessence of the successful ad model in podcasting,

12
00:00:47.101 --> 00:00:51.660
right?
It's like this is you.
It's working fantastically well for you.

13
00:00:51.661 --> 00:00:55.380
And for people like Tim Ferriss and you know,
probably Mark Marin.

14
00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:56.760
I mean there's this,
there's some,

15
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.640
because it was kind of like a winner take all thing happening in the space where

16
00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:04.230
ads are working great.
Um,
and I am a really,

17
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.380
also a highly successful example of the support model is like the PBS model or

18
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:15.900
the NPR model.
And what's weird is that I can't like that we,
you know,

19
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.310
you and are both surrounded by people who have podcasts to have podcasts and are

20
00:01:20.311 --> 00:01:25.280
asking us for advice about how to succeed and how to monetize.
And like,

21
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.760
I'm not even in a place where I can recommend my model to anyone else.
Right.

22
00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:33.090
Because it's,
it's a very,
you know,
it's,
it's very hit or miss.
I mean,

23
00:01:33.091 --> 00:01:36.570
I had just happened to have developed an audience that will support my work.

24
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.900
And you had developed that audience previously,
ironically enough on youtube.

25
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.930
There's a lot of youtube,
well,
yeah,

26
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.670
just debates and random people putting people,

27
00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:49.590
putting my content on their youtube channels,
but mostly debates,
right?
Yeah.

28
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.260
And as a,
you know,
as an author.
But it would,
I mean it was just the,

29
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.280
the podcast grew and I had this sort of forest choice,

30
00:01:57.301 --> 00:02:00.570
where am I going to go the,
the,
the ad route or,
or not.

31
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.700
And I found that,

32
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.250
I mean I have two things to to say,
you know,
fairly strongly against ads,

33
00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:10.620
but what we're really only one of them applies to me.

34
00:02:10.621 --> 00:02:13.710
And I don't think it applies to you or Tim or,
or anyone else.

35
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.320
I just felt personally I couldn't use ads because of search is what my platform

36
00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:23.760
is and the kinds of topics I'm engaging.
And it just didn't work.

37
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.760
I mean there was nothing high brow enough where I felt like my credibility

38
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:31.620
wasn't getting subtly undermine.

39
00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:34.660
Bye Bye shilling for it and make it be something that I just legit loved.

40
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.320
And it could have been the Oxford English dictionary,
you know,
like you guys,

41
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.840
he is the best dictionary in the world.
You guys should use it.

42
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.720
I still couldn't do it and I might try it with,

43
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.300
the only thing I took on as a sponsor was audible.

44
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.480
And I did that for some weeks and then it just,
you know,
I love audible but,

45
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.770
but it,
it just felt wrong.

46
00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:52.950
And so I decided to just experiment with a different business model.

47
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.900
And it's working for me,
but it's,

48
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.050
I don't think it can for most people.
And I th I view that as a problem.
And I,

49
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:06.390
and I,
and the thing that I think is interesting is that there's,

50
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.010
this is much bigger than podcasting.
So you have like,

51
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.050
you have Facebook on the one hand,
which is just a,

52
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.360
a totally free platform where,

53
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.290
where the users don't even realize that they're not the customers,

54
00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:21.720
they're the actual product,
right?

55
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.730
They use is the users are having their attention sold to advertisers and it's

56
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:30.490
this enormous business.
And on the other end of the digital spectrum,

57
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:35.260
you have Netflix,
which is just a stark paywall,
right?
And,
um,

58
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.110
there's no way in but to pay the subscription and you know,
that's,
and you know,

59
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.840
Netflix could run ads and get more money if they wanted to,
but they're,
you know,

60
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.660
they're not doing that and presumably won't do that.

61
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.200
And I'm hoping just generally speaking at the digital future,

62
00:03:51.201 --> 00:03:54.190
it looks much more like Netflix and much less like Facebook.

63
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.730
And because I see what ads has ads have done is they've anchored everyone to the

64
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:01.990
illusion of free.

65
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.990
Everyone expects their digital content for free except in places like Netflix,

66
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.460
right?
So like if when you release a comedy special,

67
00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:13.360
when you really release your next hour and you sell it to neck Netflix,

68
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.040
I would imagine there are very few people in,
in your fan base who are thinking,

69
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.430
well,
fuck Joe Rogan,
why didn't he just put that out on Youtube?
Right?

70
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:26.230
Why is this on Netflix?
They sort of understand that this piece of content is,

71
00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:28.570
belongs on that shelf,
and that if they want it,

72
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.100
they have to subscribe to Netflix.

73
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.990
Whereas if you did something slightly different,
but you know,

74
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.340
functionally the same if you put it on Vimeo and charge people $5 or whatever,

75
00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:43.690
you know,
Vimeo on demand,
um,
you,
I think you'd get a lot more pain,
right?
Yeah.

76
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.850
People would say,
well fuck you.
You greedy bastard.

77
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:50.610
Like if you're already doing great,
just release your stuff.
Right?
Yeah.
And I,

78
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.190
I view that as a problem.
It's like,
it's like a psychological problem.

79
00:04:54.191 --> 00:04:58.270
People have been anchored to the ad subsidized model more or less everywhere,

80
00:04:58.271 --> 00:05:01.990
and they expect everything for free.
And in my world,

81
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.590
I'm trying to just continually Brooke that expectation and push people into a

82
00:05:09.761 --> 00:05:13.790
different sense of you get what you pay for.
And so that,

83
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.800
the hybrid model I've created for myself is I'm putting more stuff behind a

84
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.260
paywall,
right?
I mean it.
So this is not just pure sponsorship of,

85
00:05:23.261 --> 00:05:27.460
of otherwise free content,
but I'm a,
I'm very personally,

86
00:05:27.461 --> 00:05:31.000
I'm very uncomfortable with the idea that if someone actually can't afford it,

87
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.210
they can't get access to my content.
So I just tell people,

88
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.020
if you really can't afford the stuff behind my pay wall or you really can't

89
00:05:38.021 --> 00:05:39.250
afford my meditation APP,

90
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.130
just send us an email and we'll give it to you for free.
Right.

91
00:05:42.131 --> 00:05:45.040
So I've heard that.
I was like,
this guy's crazy.
I mean,
it's actually,

92
00:05:45.041 --> 00:05:48.950
it's actually in the pricing in the APP store for my meditation APP.
It's like,

93
00:05:48.951 --> 00:05:51.100
you know,
there's the pricing and then below that there's,

94
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.160
if you can't afford this,
you know,
here's the,
here's the email address.

95
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.850
I think that's fantastic.
And so that's feels free.
Yeah,

96
00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.090
I'm splitting it that way,
but I'm raising prices.
So it was like,

97
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.270
it's like a sword because I think everything is too cheap in the,

98
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.640
in the digital space I think.
I think we're anchored to,
I mean,

99
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:12.641
there are people who will spend $5 a day on a cup of coffee every day for the

100
00:06:13.131 --> 00:06:14.060
rest of their lives.

101
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.830
And yet if you told them this podcast or this app that they,

102
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.870
that they say is incredibly valuable to them is going to cost them $5 a month,

103
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.790
they've,
they feel raped.
Right.
You know,
so it's,
and,

104
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.910
and I completely understand it because I know what it's like to hit a pay wall

105
00:06:31.911 --> 00:06:35.540
and think I can't get my credit card out again.
I'm not going to pay for this.

106
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.490
I'm going to find this information somewhere else.

107
00:06:37.491 --> 00:06:41.300
So we've all been anchored to this thing and you know,

108
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.800
something is going to win in the end.
I mean,
I,
you know,
I think at some point,

109
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.843
you know,

110
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.970
it's going to look much more like Netflix or much more like a Facebook.
And I'm,

111
00:06:51.971 --> 00:06:55.160
I'm,
I'm,
you know,
I'm throwing my lot in with the former,
but you know,
it's,

112
00:06:55.161 --> 00:06:56.570
it really is the wild west.
Well,

113
00:06:56.571 --> 00:07:00.500
the Netflix things different because Netflix has programs that cost a lot of

114
00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:04.130
money to create,
this podcast is very easy.
You're my friend,
I'll call you up.
Hey,

115
00:07:04.131 --> 00:07:05.990
you want to do a podcast?
He come over here.
I mean,

116
00:07:05.991 --> 00:07:08.870
obviously we had to pay for all this equipment,
but other than that,
it's just,

117
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.590
and then with,
and rent and all that stuff.
But other than that,
it just goes up.

118
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.130
Whereas you do a comedy special across hundreds of thousands of dollars.

119
00:07:16.131 --> 00:07:20.160
You have to secure a venue,
you have to hire staff.
I mean,
it's a big deal.
It's,

120
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:24.620
it's,
that's,
and that's an easy thing in terms of like,
Bang for their buck.
What,

121
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:29.600
what Netflix,
we'll get out of it.
Um,
if you do a television show,
I mean,
my God,

122
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.120
you,
you,
you need to hire hundreds of people.

123
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:37.010
There's wardrobe and makeup and set and there's writers and producers and

124
00:07:37.011 --> 00:07:39.590
executives and everyone has to go over the script with a fine tooth comb.

125
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.200
It's incredibly,
incredibly strenuous.

126
00:07:42.201 --> 00:07:45.560
There's a lot going on when you create a television like stranger things or

127
00:07:45.561 --> 00:07:46.281
something like that.
I mean,

128
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:51.281
you have so much special effects and so to ask for that for free seems to be to

129
00:07:51.531 --> 00:07:56.000
me seems ridiculous.
Well,
yeah,
but except the,
I mean,

130
00:07:56.001 --> 00:07:57.320
so I'm kind of splitting,
again,

131
00:07:57.321 --> 00:08:01.040
I'm running on two tracks here and APP is much more like a television show,

132
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:05.990
surprisingly then than it is like a podcast.
But even if,
if it's just a podcast,

133
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:10.270
if you want to build something,
if you want to build a media company like,
like,

134
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.600
like let's say you were,

135
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:16.270
let's say you were asking for support for this otherwise free Pie podcast,
uh,

136
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.040
people don't know what your aspirations are.
I mean,

137
00:08:19.041 --> 00:08:21.580
maybe you want to start a podcast network,
right?
Maybe you have,

138
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.900
you're trying to build a business that is,

139
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.620
that maybe you have massive payroll expenses that you,

140
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.100
you know,

141
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:34.100
so the expectation that the product should always be free closes the door to any

142
00:08:34.761 --> 00:08:39.620
of those aspirations if in fact you have them.
And you know,
it's like,
um,

143
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.580
I mean it is,
it's very interesting psychologically because I have,

144
00:08:43.581 --> 00:08:46.040
I've created this network of support from my podcast,

145
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:51.640
but I see people do calculations that they would never do in a more

146
00:08:52.881 --> 00:08:56.160
transactional space that they were just,
let's say buying my next book,
right?

147
00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:58.290
So like,
um,
for me,

148
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.480
offering a free podcast and then saying,
if you find this valuable,

149
00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:06.470
you can support it,
right?
That,
you know,

150
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.960
from the side of being a creator of that content,
it feels like leaf,

151
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:15.080
the most transparent interaction possible because a person can listen for free

152
00:09:15.301 --> 00:09:18.690
for as long as they want to just discover how valuable it is and then they can

153
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.910
support it to the degree that they find it valuable.

154
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:25.230
Whereas if I'm selling you a book,
you can't even read the book before you,

155
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.350
before you buy it.
Right?
You have to make the decision to buy it.

156
00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:31.110
And I'm trying to convince you to buy it because it took me all this time to

157
00:09:31.111 --> 00:09:35.670
write it and,
and uh,
you know,
you're,
you know,
it's,
it's,
it's transactional

158
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.570
with,
but with a podcast,

159
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.600
people make calculations that they would never make when they're just figuring

160
00:09:44.761 --> 00:09:46.650
out whether they want to buy something.
It's like,
like I'll,

161
00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:50.790
and is really along the lines of what you just described.
People say,
well,

162
00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.940
how much has a podcast cost to produce?
Right?

163
00:09:53.941 --> 00:09:57.990
Like I like if I knew what you were spending the money on and what it costs you

164
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.990
to do this podcast will then I would support you.
Right?

165
00:10:00.991 --> 00:10:04.680
But they're never saying how much does it cost to write a book?

166
00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:07.830
And if I knew what you are going to spend the money on once you,

167
00:10:07.831 --> 00:10:10.290
once you were once,
once I bought this book,

168
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.460
then I would know whether or not I wanted to buy it.

169
00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.920
You either want the book or you don't.
Right.

170
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.800
So the problem with the support model and this the Po,

171
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:20.940
the problem with Patriot and everything else is that get engaged as the sort of

172
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:23.820
the philanthropy charity side of the brain,
right?

173
00:10:23.821 --> 00:10:27.840
And people are worried about what you're going to do and how much it all costs.

174
00:10:27.841 --> 00:10:30.330
Like how much does is my cost?
Right.
You know,
like that,
that's,

175
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.390
that's a question that someone is asking when they're donating,
it wasn't,

176
00:10:33.391 --> 00:10:38.010
and donating.
And the problem there is they're not understanding,

177
00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.280
you know,
just the opportunity costs.
Like I,
you know,

178
00:10:41.281 --> 00:10:42.840
I have to decide how to spend my time.

179
00:10:42.841 --> 00:10:46.740
Am I going to spend 90% of my time on a podcast?
Well,
that if,

180
00:10:46.741 --> 00:10:51.480
so that closes the door to virtually everything else I can do.

181
00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:55.630
Right.
So it's,
you know,
it's,
it has to become a viable business.
And so,
I mean,
I,

182
00:10:55.631 --> 00:10:59.340
I've recognized now that I'm,
you know,

183
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:03.900
to some degree going against the grain of human psychology in asking for
support.

184
00:11:03.901 --> 00:11:04.530
And now I,

185
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:08.160
now I feel like I'm going to ask much less and I'm going to tell people what the

186
00:11:08.161 --> 00:11:11.310
business model is.
And,
and you know,
and still look and remind them of it,

187
00:11:11.311 --> 00:11:13.560
but I'm personally,

188
00:11:13.561 --> 00:11:17.040
I'm going to go more and more that in the direction of putting stuff behind a

189
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:20.460
paywall.
And if people want it,
then they can support.

190
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.910
And so it's kind of,
it's sort of Netflix,

191
00:11:23.911 --> 00:11:27.600
the ultimate version of it would be if it were Netflix,

192
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.640
that would also let you get it for free if you really couldn't afford it.
That,

193
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.940
I mean that,
that that's the,
the guilt free business model that I'm,

194
00:11:34.941 --> 00:11:36.570
I'm converging on now.
I like it.

195
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:40.530
I like how you're thinking and I'd like the ethics involved in it and I think

196
00:11:40.531 --> 00:11:43.230
it's a great thing.
And when you set it on your podcast,
I was shocked,

197
00:11:43.231 --> 00:11:44.580
but it makes sense coming from you.
