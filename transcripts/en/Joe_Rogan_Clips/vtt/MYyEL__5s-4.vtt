00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.640
Because interviewing Barbara Yanna.
You got it on the truck.

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.580
They must be from the truck out of respect.
Who has it?
They give you?

3
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.980
Sometimes I'm walking to the cage and they give me the thing in my ear.

4
00:00:07.981 --> 00:00:11.760
Winner and loser.
Yeah.
Oh really?
Every now and then man.
Yeah.

5
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.460
Did David approach you to work for ESPN or not?
We just get,
it was like no.

6
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:16.410
We know where he's not,
not interested,

7
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.370
but I don't feel like I would take this for zero money over being in Phoenix

8
00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:20.940
right now,

9
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.970
although I would want to see those fights live and I'd love to call those fights

10
00:00:23.971 --> 00:00:27.690
like I'm good with 10 a year.
That's what I like.
I like 10 a year.

11
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.100
But did they coach you?
They didn't even want to,
nope.
10 10 a year.
10 years.
What?

12
00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:36.930
I like once a month.
10 shows,
10 a year.
What's a month dude?
Once a month.
What?

13
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.130
Just the paper?
Two months.
Two months off.
Once a month.
Listen man,

14
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.140
I was thinking that I was on my way out.

15
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.460
I was really thinking I was on my way out,

16
00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:48.480
but I still love it and I love it way more now because I don't have to do it as

17
00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:49.314
much,

18
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.590
and I love it way more now because we do this because we can do all this shit

19
00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:55.050
talking and have fun and be silly.
