1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.910
I think it's like that with alligators in Florida.

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.420
<v 1>Yeah.
When I was a kid,
they were an endangered species.</v>

3
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.030
They would ask us to please not feed them marshmallows.

4
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.220
Cause I lived in Gainesville right by this place called Lake Alice Lake outside

5
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.880
alligators was fucking 11 years old.
I was living in an alligator.
This was crazy.

6
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.530
It was a goddamn dinosaur.

7
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.250
But there was a small population of them cause they had been whacked into

8
00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:24.590
oblivion before and people were making suitcases out of them.

9
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.790
And then they made it illegal to hunt them and they made him a protected
species.

10
00:00:28.791 --> 00:00:30.200
But then they fucked up.

11
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.800
They overprotected and those God damn super lizards are everywhere.

12
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.530
<v 0>Fucking everywhere.</v>

13
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.310
My mom belongs to a golf course down in Florida where she lives.

14
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.380
And there's this alligator's apparently like this fucking 14 foot alligator.

15
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.490
And uh,
the people were playing golf and it was a deer.
And everybody's on the,

16
00:00:48.491 --> 00:00:51.150
everybody standing there going like,
it's a deer.
It's a deer.

17
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.210
Look at that beautiful fucking alligator comes out,
grabs it,

18
00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.160
pulls it into the water,
does that spin move?
Takes it to the bottom.

19
00:01:00.161 --> 00:01:04.720
Fucking done.
So everyone's talking about it,
what do we do about it?

20
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.660
So about three weeks later,

21
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.070
my mom is out on the course and her ball is right next to the lake where the

22
00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:17.071
alligator is and she forgets and she goes over and her ball is right on the edge

23
00:01:17.621 --> 00:01:21.820
and she's standing there and she was standing on some fucking like dead,

24
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.350
some dead grass.

25
00:01:23.351 --> 00:01:28.351
And he gave out and she fell in the fucking lake up to her neck.

26
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.620
And then she remembered and she fucking started scrambling up the mud and

27
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.630
grabbing at the reeds to get out of there.

28
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.390
And her and the people that who she was with had left,

29
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.580
she was playing by herself for some reason and she fucking got out of there and

30
00:01:45.581 --> 00:01:48.870
got in the cart and,
and then she just started laughing.
Oh my God.

31
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.670
You believe that shit.
My little mother,
my little five foot two mother

32
00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.920
would have been a tasty meal and so quick.
Yeah.

33
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.130
Better than a dear old lady.
Nice.
Soft.
All Lady.
Way more tender.

34
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.960
Yeah.
Corn Fed.
My mom's corn fed.

35
00:02:10.961 --> 00:02:14.410
I never told you that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I thought she was organic now.

36
00:02:14.411 --> 00:02:16.500
Now we let her free range.
Sometimes

37
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.170
<v 1>there's a great story about a car chase.</v>

38
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.360
The cops were chasing this too with Solon car and a guy jumps off a bridge into

39
00:02:25.361 --> 00:02:29.170
the water and immediately gets eaten by alligators.
Wow.

40
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.850
He's like a little overpass over river,
which is hops out of the fucking car,

41
00:02:33.851 --> 00:02:38.830
jumps into the river and smash.
He lands right in front of an alligator.

42
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.770
No Sheldon Jackson in front of the cops.

43
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.480
<v 0>Wow.</v>

44
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.510
<v 1>What do you do of your cop?
Do you shoot it?
The alligator?</v>

45
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.390
Do you try to kill the alligator was killing the guy.
Good point.
I mean,

46
00:02:50.391 --> 00:02:53.480
that's a reckless thing to be doing when there's a lot of thrashing around.

47
00:02:53.481 --> 00:02:57.170
You're just going to empty your clip,
pat.
Pat,
Pat,
you know,
I mean,

48
00:02:57.171 --> 00:02:59.850
how much distance is there between the bridge,
the water,
right?

49
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.450
<v 0>What can the cop do?
Well,
you know the guy's going to die.
So I think it's a,</v>

50
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.290
I think it's a safe bet to take some shots anyway.

51
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.560
I think it's a not safe bet to take some shots because if you're a cop,

52
00:03:09.561 --> 00:03:11.270
what have you hit the guy and they said,
oh,

53
00:03:11.271 --> 00:03:15.320
you shot and trying to cover up by literally a fucking alligators.
Eat them.

54
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.840
It's true.
You got to let the alligator eat them.

55
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.190
Now you got to save your job here about the guy who was the guy flying a plane

56
00:03:22.191 --> 00:03:26.150
from Florida to Cuba or,
or Cuba to Florida,

57
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.270
and the plain fucking went down and he survived the crash and then got eaten by

58
00:03:33.351 --> 00:03:34.184
sharks.

59
00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.660
That's so fun.
Is that that 20 minute period where you're floating in the water,

60
00:03:44.661 --> 00:03:49.100
but you're thankful and you're almost giddy?
I did it.
I fucking survived.

61
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.860
Oh my God.
Yeah.
Bad Day.

62
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.800
<v 1>Well,
you know that story about the World War II boat that sank in,</v>

63
00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:57.670
the guys were floating around at sea for several days and most of them got eaten

64
00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:01.660
by sharks.
Oh,
that's the store that they talk about in the beginning of jaws.

65
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.780
Yeah.
I remember where the captain,

66
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.070
the captain at the fucking scars and he starts talking about his,
uh,

67
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:12.100
his time on the boat.
Yeah.
Do you remember that scenery?
Scheider no,

68
00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:15.760
not Roy Scheider.
The guy was talking to Roy Scheider.
Okay.
Who's that guy?

69
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.390
What's that guy's name again?
Old Time Act.
And the guy was fucking amazing.

70
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.850
Spool up jaws to quit.
Richard Dreyfus.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

71
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.120
Richard drivers was a scientist.
Roy Scheider was the sheriff.

72
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:31.720
Richard Dreyfus was the scientist.
And then there's,
uh,
an older gentleman.

73
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.060
<v 0>Oh yeah.
Right.
He steals that fucking fuck.
Yeah.</v>

74
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.100
<v 1>Heals up movie.
Where is he?
Right here.
He steals that fucking movie.</v>

75
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.530
He steals how fucking movie you believe him?
Wait,
so what was the opening scene?

76
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.330
Not the opening scene,
but he describes what it was like.
No,

77
00:04:52.331 --> 00:04:56.230
that's a different shark attack typed in World War II.
All the naval ship.
Yeah,

78
00:04:56.231 --> 00:04:57.430
that's it.
That's it.
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.890
I was thinking once the worst shark attack in history.

80
00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:03.310
I was thinking it was that story about New Jersey where the bull sharks killed

81
00:05:03.311 --> 00:05:06.310
people.
Scroll back up so I can see what it says here.

82
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.410
1945 US naval ship was sunk by a Japanese summering.

83
00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:14.170
The ship's sinking was just the beginning of the sailors nightmare.
Yeah,

84
00:05:14.171 --> 00:05:19.150
that's the boat.
That's the story.
How many people died?
Hello?
Shit load.
Let's see.

85
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.940
300 people died of the 1,196 men aboard 900 made it into the water alive there

86
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.740
ordeal.
So that's,
that's how many survived the crash.

87
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.420
So there's 900 of them that are alive now.
How many of them make it to the end?

88
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.560
Out of 900 scroll,
Scroll,
Scroll.
Let's grow it.

89
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.861
Yeah,
this is,

90
00:05:47.861 --> 00:05:49.950
they're just giving you the full line of the story that I'm giving you.

91
00:05:49.951 --> 00:05:54.910
Just the actual facts.
317 remained.

92
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.420
So,
so almost 600 people got to eat

93
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.430
<v 0>estimates of the number who die from shark attacks range from a few dozen to</v>

94
00:06:03.431 --> 00:06:04.970
almost 150

95
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.540
<v 1>so the other people die from other things.
Oh,</v>

96
00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.430
heat stroke being in the water could be.
And so I bet when those guys died,

97
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.320
then the sharks ate them and it got even worse.
Fuck man.
Wow,

98
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.410
that's fucking crazy.
Just imagine 150 people eaten by sharks.

99
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.640
The amount of blood in the water,
fucking Christ,

100
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.213
you know,

101
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:34.160
but when you around any kind of thing that can eat you and kill you,

102
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.850
it puts it all into perspective that you're not,
you're not around that enough.

103
00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.970
And it's not,
it's not like you should be around it all the time,

104
00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:43.940
but you should know it's a real thing.
And when you were around it,
you go like,

105
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.000
oh,
oh sharks just,
we'll just eat.

106
00:06:47.001 --> 00:06:51.500
You owe a bear will just eat you.
Oh,
a mountain lion will just eat you.

107
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.250
Oh.
Like these people that got killed this year was a,

108
00:06:55.251 --> 00:06:58.970
or 2018 at least was very rare.
And that two people were documented,

109
00:06:58.971 --> 00:07:01.070
killed by mountain lions in the Pacific northwest.

110
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.340
One guy in Portland outside of Portland and one guy outside of Seattle.

111
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.390
It's pretty rare that mountain lions do that.
But Oh,

112
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.930
not lines will just eat you.
Oh,
that can happen too.

113
00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.960
Like we think we're so safe,

114
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.780
<v 0>Dave.
And I think it,
I think you're right.
It will keep you in the moment.</v>

115
00:07:16.781 --> 00:07:21.781
I think we should release like grizzly in cities just because like you might be

116
00:07:22.541 --> 00:07:25.150
worried about,
oh,
am I the fucking stock market's down,

117
00:07:25.151 --> 00:07:29.200
or I think my wife's cheating,
and you're right back in.

118
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.530
<v 1>Yeah,
you're in the moment.</v>

119
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.050
But then you going to have to allow people to be armed to protect themselves.

120
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.310
Guys going to have open carry,

121
00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.820
fucking ar slung around their shoulders looking out for bears everywhere.

122
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.860
Taking your kid to school,
you'd better bring the rifle.
