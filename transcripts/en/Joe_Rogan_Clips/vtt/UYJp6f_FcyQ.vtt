1
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.020
Well,
it seems like a,
especially with boxing right now,

2
00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:07.770
the talent level is extremely high.
I mean it is with MMA as well.

3
00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:10.320
But I mean with boxing it seems to be on an upswing.

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.160
And it also seems like people really interested in some of these big rivalries

5
00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:18.780
like triple g and Canelo.
That was two amazing fights.

6
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.350
I thought the first one was a robbery.
I thought that a triple g one,

7
00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:26.130
the first one,
but the second they don't fight again.
Really?
Yeah.
Why is that?

8
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.570
Because,
uh,

9
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.190
when you get a guy that hits as hard as triple g does and you get a guy that's

10
00:00:32.191 --> 00:00:34.170
as good as Canelo,
you know,
and,

11
00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:37.110
and they're in there even though they're not getting dropped and are not getting

12
00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:41.220
knocked out,
the dumb type of flights take a lot out of you.
They really do.

13
00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:44.700
And they shared a lot in those two fights and we don't know,

14
00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:48.600
even right now if the next fight or to fight after that Canelo start showing

15
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:52.110
somebody affects from those first two fights.
You think so?
Yeah.

16
00:00:52.111 --> 00:00:56.280
You get a guy that hits two guys that hit that hard and earned her fighting like

17
00:00:56.281 --> 00:00:59.760
that,
eventually it does drain you a little bit and that will catch up.

18
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.990
I think a third fight we'll shorten a career of Canelo.

19
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.240
I'm not going to say triple g because triple g is my age now and I,

20
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.190
I have a film that his might be getting short here pretty soon anyways,

21
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.050
just due to age.
But Canelo I mean that,
that's,
it was a brutal fights.

22
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.040
They were brutal fights.

23
00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:20.610
Did you think that some people thought that triple g one the second fight as

24
00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:23.670
well?
I thought it was much closer to [inaudible] than the first fight.

25
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.110
But did you think that Canelo triple g?
I think Conello showed some improvement,

26
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.080
but it's also possible the triple g might've slowed down a little bit.

27
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.040
I think so.
Um,
you know,
the first fight I had at nine three for triple g,

28
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.230
that's how I spent sounds about right.
Yeah.

29
00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:41.520
And I gave the first three rounds to Canelo and then I had every round after for

30
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.600
triple g this fight,
I thought Canelo one close fight.

31
00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:48.770
And if you gave it to the triple g,
I wouldn't have screened where are bright.

32
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.910
You know,
teddy was saying that he thought that triple g one but um,
I felt like,

33
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.640
well it's a pretty close fight pretty close by,

34
00:01:56.641 --> 00:01:58.860
but certainly Conello showed much improvement.

35
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.030
He did and he fought a better fight.
The first half of the fight.

36
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.450
I gave a kind of a lot of them rouse because I thought he controlled the fight

37
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:09.850
with the two body shots and everybody thought triple g was controlling him with

38
00:02:09.851 --> 00:02:10.684
the jab.

39
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.000
But the reason why triple g wasn't using his size and strength was because it

40
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:18.660
was using his jab was because of the body shots that Canelo was landing.
I mean,

41
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:19.890
they were brutal.
And,
uh,

42
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.220
I just thought Canelo dictated a pace of those first couple of rounds.

43
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.350
I thought he won enough of the early rounds and obviously triple g one the

44
00:02:28.351 --> 00:02:30.780
second most of the second half of the fight,

45
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.000
but I thought it was a little too late,
you know,

46
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:37.380
and then I can follow up by around her too.
Yeah.
Um,
it's,

47
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:38.970
it's just one,
those are,

48
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.760
those are two fighters that really sort of epitomize uh,

49
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.900
what people like to see when they like to see like these classic rivalries,

50
00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:51.510
right?
Like a guy like triple g who's just forward pressure,

51
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:52.920
constant throwing bombs,

52
00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:57.180
knockout puncher or garlic Canelo who's just one of those classic Mexican

53
00:02:57.181 --> 00:03:01.300
fighters that has incredible heart,
wants to fight the best of the best,

54
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:06.200
like really like really takes it into bite.
Yeah.

55
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.740
Yeah.
It's the on the ropes with triple g and let him,

56
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.730
let him use that power to beat your Oregon's then one of those sites,
you know,

57
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.340
I was sitting,
I'm going,
I'm not wanting to talk.

58
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.550
I kind of like getting in and getting involved myself with guys,

59
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:23.551
especially like Miranda who I personally believe it harder than a triple g.

60
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.940
But yeah.
And I was a guy there,
but that was my strategy as we're Canelo.

61
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.760
I wasn't,
I really wasn't a great strategy.
You know,

62
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:32.470
I didn't lay on a ropes and let Miranda,

63
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.830
do you think he just didn't know what to expect until he was in there with

64
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:38.730
triple gene?
It could have been because everything changes.

65
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.390
Like I think Mike Tyson said it,
you know,

66
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.800
everybody's got a game plan until they get hit.
Uh,
he might've got touched,

67
00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:46.450
like I said,
even what the,
uh,

68
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.050
tension and that Mayweather fighting the whole brain might have just started

69
00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:53.230
going a thousand miles an hour trying to figure out,
okay,

70
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.470
like this ain't going to probably work tonight with this guy because he's a lot

71
00:03:56.471 --> 00:03:59.890
stronger than I expected.
And he was just trying to maybe tire him out.

72
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.660
The only issue is now you're,

73
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.330
when you're on the ropes like that and you're getting hit by a guy that hits

74
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:09.220
that hard and adults in the elbow and the forearms and,
and to the body,

75
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.920
and then you're,

76
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.520
you're tightening up and you're tensing up really hard and you're cutting the

77
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:16.510
oxygen off to the blood.
It tires you out quicker and it wears you down.
You know,

78
00:04:16.511 --> 00:04:20.770
more than what he was doing in the middle of the ring by pop shot and,
and,

79
00:04:20.771 --> 00:04:24.430
and counter punching.
And he could have dictated how fast he wanted.
You know,

80
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:27.070
how much you wanted to punch all hard.
He wanted to punch.
Yeah.

81
00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:31.750
We certainly made some big improvements in that second fight.
Yeah.
Do you,
um,

82
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.320
you,
you really don't want to see them fight a third time?
I truly don't.

83
00:04:35.321 --> 00:04:38.920
I mean if it happens,
I'm going to watch it,
you know,
but they're going to fight.

84
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:39.161
Right.

85
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:42.610
I mean Canelo is obviously going to fight some people and triple g's obviously

86
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:44.860
going to continue fighting,
you know,
and again,

87
00:04:44.861 --> 00:04:47.740
I don't know how long triple g's going to fight because as you mentioned,

88
00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:50.620
and I agree with you,
I think he's starting to,

89
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.160
his age is showing up a little bit with him.
Well,
I mean he,

90
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.860
he got avoided by a lot of people and we,
you know,

91
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.450
when he had a paper view a couple of years back that only got 150,000 buys.

92
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.920
And I remember thinking that is a damn shame.
It is.

93
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.720
It's a damn shame that people don't realize that this is absolutely one of the

94
00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:12.880
best fighters ever.
I was surprised by that too,

95
00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:16.150
cause I think he's a lot more popular than what those numbers show.

96
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.630
I didn't get it.
I don't understand.
I mean,
I don't,

97
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.470
maybe it's because they didn't think the fight was competitive.
Maybe.
I mean,

98
00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:26.050
maybe I don't know what it was,
but it just,
it seemed like,

99
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.040
I just think personally,
am I soft?
There's a lot of flights out there for Canelo.

100
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.900
He just went up to one 68.
I'm not a big fan of that.
You know,

101
00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.580
think he's too small for 16.
I do.

102
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.180
Especially if you get in with the right fighter.
I truly do believe that.

103
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.550
You know,
everybody,
how tall is easy?
Five,
10,
five,
nine,
five,
10.
Um,

104
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.010
but you know what?
Boxing or like football,
when you see the height,

105
00:05:48.011 --> 00:05:51.510
you always got to take an inch,
inch and a half off to,
so how did they lie?

106
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.940
They had me listed six,
three.
I'm right under six.
Two by like that much.

107
00:05:54.941 --> 00:05:57.950
So it's kind of like the football program and high.
Right,
right,
right,
right,

108
00:05:57.951 --> 00:05:59.150
right.
But um,

109
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.100
Canelo I think that there's guys out there stay in at 68.
It's kind of dangerous.

110
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.130
I think he's great.
And how talented enough to be,
keep good fights out there.

111
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.470
Yeah.
But it's a little dangerous in my opinion.

112
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:11.990
I think it 68 could cause problems for them.

113
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.040
You got even the guys like Dope Benevidez those are dangerous fights.

114
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:17.390
Just them two guys right there.

115
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.420
I would have to take not so much overall skill wise,

116
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.580
just size and being at that weight and you know,
um,

117
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.290
you got guys coming down like be evil from one 75 to one 68.

118
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.760
I think that his better days are going to be at one 60.
You know,

119
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.240
does he have a hard time making 60 or do you just have an opportunity to fight

120
00:06:37.241 --> 00:06:41.450
68 and he took it,
I think it's the trophies and I don't blame him for that.

121
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.760
And you,

122
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.440
he had the right flight to go up to one 68 so we get another weight division

123
00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:49.280
under his belt.
Yeah.
He knows tuning that dude up and I think that'd be what,

124
00:06:49.281 --> 00:06:54.110
three now?
He's a three week class champ.
Yeah.
And uh,
so that,

125
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.070
it looks good on paper when you retire.
Yeah,
it does.

126
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.930
I would have done it if I could have,
you know,
if there,

127
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.160
if there was the right fights out there.
But when he fought Mayweather,

128
00:07:04.161 --> 00:07:06.830
Mayweather made them cut down to what,
52 was it?
Something like that.

129
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:09.900
I think the idea that were out a catch weight around that,
um,

130
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.620
that fight was to me,

131
00:07:12.621 --> 00:07:15.470
while it was a good learning experience for him to be in there with a guy who

132
00:07:15.471 --> 00:07:19.010
was a slick as Floyd is,
but also a good learning experience.

133
00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:21.020
So you're not supposed to suck that much weight out of your body.

134
00:07:21.021 --> 00:07:23.420
Just he didn't have the fire.
No.

135
00:07:23.421 --> 00:07:28.040
Even though you have a 24 hours or however long it is to try to rehydrate,

136
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.580
that's never enough time to recoup.
Yeah.
Not so your,

137
00:07:31.581 --> 00:07:35.030
your thing is you're just hoping your opponent's going through the same thing

138
00:07:35.031 --> 00:07:37.100
that you are,
you know,
that's what it comes down to.
