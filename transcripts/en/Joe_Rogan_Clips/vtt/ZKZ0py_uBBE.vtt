1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.150
When you did that there wasn't a completely insane you're doing.
Yeah,

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.080
that's the one.
I'm still working on it by the way,
but I,

3
00:00:07.081 --> 00:00:10.110
I can't do like you do with my knee coming out.

4
00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:14.760
I feel like when I do inspiring the guys,
they,
they see it and they they,

5
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:16.440
so I have to keep my in my knee tuck.

6
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.280
I think you're just thinking that maybe it's because of karate.

7
00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:24.390
I learned in a different way,
so my,
my brain is wired so much in a certain way.

8
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.690
The problem with karate is that lower knee,

9
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.010
the need down by the other knee versus up by the hip.

10
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.890
When you bring it up by the hip,
there's,
there's much more leverage.

11
00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:39.060
It's tremendous amount of force and the alignment of your lower leg,

12
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.990
the supporting leg and the kicking leg is better to generate force,

13
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.280
whereas the kicking leg is almost independent of the lower leg if you're going

14
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.270
up because they're not moving in the same direction.
One leg is going up,

15
00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:53.030
the other ladies going forward,
so it's like,
Eh,

16
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.480
it's all goofy when the hip is up.
When you turn,

17
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.280
the hip is up.
This is pushing and this is going forward.
It's just so boom,
I,

18
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.260
it is throw the power comes from however.
Do you you,

19
00:01:05.261 --> 00:01:09.030
you come from taekwondo is all the Olympic athletes like champion.

20
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.570
They don't do it like that.
Yeah.
No,
no they don't.
No,
exactly.

21
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.080
Do you do with an a different ways.
Right.
But man,

22
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.480
I never seen anybody hit as hard.
Like I don't care if it's a punch.

23
00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:21.390
Like I never see a strike a strike.

24
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.530
I blow from a human being that hard man.
I remember that.

25
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.300
That bag when you were working in it was I fricking whole lot of loss in the
bag.

26
00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:34.920
It was like a curves and the bag like with your,
your footprint in it.

27
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.660
I'm like,
it's Scotland.
Insane man.
It's a lot of power.
I was with Bravo at Ed.

28
00:01:39.661 --> 00:01:41.130
I remember we were freaking out.

29
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.610
Then you want to going back and forward and I like,
you know,
we,

30
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.700
we work together because of Danaher.
Yeah.

31
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.020
Cause John came up to me and just asking me because I was a commentator,
he said,

32
00:01:52.021 --> 00:01:56.310
I need someone to help George with the fundamentals of a spinning back kick.

33
00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.780
He needs like a,
like a technique refresher.
Do you know anybody?
And I said,

34
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:03.780
this is gonna sound crazy.
I could just gotta to listen to me,

35
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.130
but I have a really good spinning back kick.
So that's how,

36
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.300
that's how you put it out and just smart.
I said he put it to me just asking.
No,

37
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.100
no.
He would talk.
He knew.
He said no,
he knew that.

38
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.290
He told me he's going to ask you is going to ask if you could work with me.

39
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.180
That's funny because he said it to me.
No,
no,
no.
Knew somebody now.

40
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.040
But you want to put it this way because Johnny Johnny's smart guy,
John,

41
00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:28.680
he's very smart guy at at,
at you.
You would have,

42
00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:31.410
if we don't have said he would have kind of,
because he,

43
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:34.940
I remember he said that to me and I say,
because he's like my son.
So he's in my,

44
00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:38.500
in my,
in my,
in my size.
I,
Yay,
right?
I'm like,
Nah.
I was rolling my eyes like,

45
00:02:38.501 --> 00:02:40.950
what the fuck is Joe Rogan?
I didn't know what your background,

46
00:02:40.951 --> 00:02:42.910
you know like I knew,
I know you did something.

47
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.030
I thought he was going to think no,
but he knew that because our word get around.

48
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.630
That word gets around that you have a very strong spinning back kick it.

49
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.640
You saw you somewhere somehow told him or he's seen it or B because he told me.

50
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.750
I remember he told me.
Then I was like,
Yay,

51
00:02:57.751 --> 00:03:00.640
I'll do it when I go train with Freddie Roach and I then I,

52
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:03.160
then I couldn't believe it.
I called him that same night.
I said,

53
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:07.130
what the fuck was that?
This should be an elite.

54
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.880
If he ever a fight [inaudible] they should be illegal.

55
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.490
You can kill someone with this van is insane,
man.

56
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:16.600
What's fucked up is it almost feels like a lie because it was so long ago.

57
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:19.420
It was a different life.
Like I stopped fighting.
I'm 50 years old.

58
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.800
I stopped fighting when I was 21 so I haven't fought in forever.

59
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.150
So it's just I've,
I keep doing it and training,
but I haven't done it so long.

60
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:32.440
So when I tell someone that I can do it,
am I,
this is us.
Is that true?

61
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:36.550
I'd be like saying,
is it true?
How many people did you,
did you ever lie it up?

62
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:41.551
Someone with that video of me when I was 19 from a taekwondo tournament making a

63
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:45.670
guy fly through the air.
Yeah,
I you serious tube?
Yeah.
Jamie.

64
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.840
Oh my God.
Is he okay now he's yelled,
I don't know.
Here it is right here.

65
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.040
Are you kidding me man?
Yeah.

66
00:03:55.041 --> 00:04:00.041
That's how fucking scratchy VHS video from 1986 you realize you didn't even cut

67
00:04:03.021 --> 00:04:06.860
him like you know,
we talk about precision like there was like,

68
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.710
like your technique is freaking price.
So powerful.

69
00:04:09.711 --> 00:04:13.130
Like you got him where on the shoulder on the,
no,
no,
I caught him on the body.

70
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.450
It wasn't in the shoulder.
You can see it again.
It's okay.

71
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.210
It's just his arm is underneath his arm

72
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.410
and put them on that guy always because it's very crowded.

73
00:04:25.411 --> 00:04:26.480
The incredibly powerful,

74
00:04:26.481 --> 00:04:29.360
like a guy would do the same thing it him and the same spot.

75
00:04:29.361 --> 00:04:32.710
It would probably be not get put away like that.
Oh,
okay.
Okay.

76
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.040
See the impact.
It goes right into his body.

77
00:04:37.041 --> 00:04:40.940
And then I extend and then when I extended he was,
I was Kinda like,

78
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.700
Oh yeah,
can you say no,
no.
And that was,
that was perfect.

79
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.560
And he just sailed through the air.
It's just,
it's a crazy,

80
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.490
it's,
it's got so much power.
It's just a crazy technique.

81
00:04:53.491 --> 00:04:55.550
And I was raised,
um,

82
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.790
in a taekwondo school that came from the old school taekwondo before

83
00:04:59.791 --> 00:05:04.680
tournament's see General Che Che Hong Yee.
He trained,

84
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:05.930
he was the inventor of talk,

85
00:05:05.931 --> 00:05:10.260
one of the founder of taekwondo and he trained a small handful of,
of,

86
00:05:10.261 --> 00:05:14.250
of elite instructors.
And one of them was Jay Hahn Kim,

87
00:05:14.251 --> 00:05:15.450
who was my instructor.

88
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.720
So my taekwondo background was the old school taekwondo for Olympic.

89
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.070
It was even,
even a consideration.
And so everyone trained for power.

90
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.890
It was a different thing.
Breaking.
Yeah,
it was just,

91
00:05:28.891 --> 00:05:32.280
it was you had to be able to defend yourself in this treat.
My instructor,

92
00:05:32.281 --> 00:05:36.390
his idea was if you couldn't hurt someone with a kick,

93
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.870
like why you and practice it and these taekwondo guys and tournaments there were

94
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:40.770
tapping each other.

95
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.150
They were just moving really fast trying to score points and he hated that shit.

96
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.170
He hated that shit and he felt like you had to load up more.

97
00:05:49.171 --> 00:05:53.940
There had to be more power into those techniques and it wasn't quite as fast as

98
00:05:53.941 --> 00:05:58.230
like the,
the really quick style Olympic point taekwondo.
Yeah,

99
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.770
but that Olympic points style wouldn't hurt anybody.

100
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.130
You couldn't keep them off of you.
But the thing is hard for me,

101
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.360
like I tried to practice your ways,
but I have a,

102
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.460
I don't know if it's my hips are,
wait,
it's just,
it's just reps.

103
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.110
It's just repetition.
Okay.
We'll go over here after we're done.

104
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.910
It's freaking hard,
man.
This gym here,
I'll,
I'll,
I'll,

105
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.970
I'll just give you a refresher.
Yeah.

106
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.300
A lot of it comes from the front leg side kick.
Nobody,
I know you and I go back.

107
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.130
I went back to karate training because I,

108
00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:28.580
I've done more tie but I was conferring from karate background.

109
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.270
We've done it straight,
not straight.
That had more,
I don't,

110
00:06:32.271 --> 00:06:35.630
I haven't done it for a backache for a long time cause they don't really do that

111
00:06:35.631 --> 00:06:40.100
much and more.
They,
when I went back to karate,
my last fight and when I start to,

112
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.710
to Redo it,
I've been taught that again.
Would they need,
yeah,

113
00:06:44.711 --> 00:06:48.590
but I liked your,
I liked the way you do it man.
He hurray.
Yeah.

114
00:06:48.591 --> 00:06:50.960
Then he has to be hired to get the full power into it.

115
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:55.010
I just don't have that same efficiency with it.
It can be done.

116
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.460
You can learn that efficiency shit a hundred percent it's freaking nuts.
Yeah.

117
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:03.630
But it comes from learning first,
the right way to do the front leg side kick.

118
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.130
See the front leg side kick.

119
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.840
You develop that tomb that that knee comes up and then boom,

120
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.450
it's all in trust in that hip and pop it it forward.

121
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.880
And then once you develop the speed from doing that,

122
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.020
then you do it with the turn and then it's turned boom.
It's the same thing.

123
00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:21.200
It's that twist of the,
the hip and the extension of the leg,

124
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.860
but then it's also the turn first.
So the turn first,
boom,

125
00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:27.290
and then the extension of the leg,
that's where that power comes from.

126
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.390
It's all in a straight line.
Okay.

127
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:33.290
And then the three 60 when the right leg is forward and you step forward and

128
00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:36.730
then throw that out was,
that's,
that's like get hit by a train.
That is,

129
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:41.270
that is that one that I,
there's the strongest Cyrus scene is that shit's crazy.

130
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:46.500
You're running it.
You're,
you're not even in your prior melanosis 50 shit.
Yeah.

131
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.960
But when I was 19 I could do it like a laser beam so fast,
you know,

132
00:07:50.961 --> 00:07:54.290
like in that video.
I mean,
I was just,
that's all I did though.
I mean,

133
00:07:54.291 --> 00:07:58.910
what from the time I was 15 till the time I was 21 I didn't do shit.

134
00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:02.450
I barely did any homework and then pay attention in school at all.

135
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.990
All I did was fight.
That's all I did was dyed taekwondo.
It's all I did.

136
00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:10.040
I just wanted to be in the Olympics.
I wanted to be a taekwondo champion.
Wow.

137
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.180
Yeah.
That's all I wanted to do it.

138
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:15.740
But then the problem was I started sparring with kickboxers getting fucked up

139
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.770
and I realized that taekwondo has no hands,

140
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.570
like the hand techniques were useless.

141
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:23.690
And when I would be in a boxing ring and it would be sparring with someone,

142
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.660
they just get me in a corner and started fucking me up.
And I was like,
oh,

143
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.930
I don't know how to do this.
Like I need to learn how to box.

144
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.520
And so I realized taekwondo in a lot of situations is not effective.

145
00:08:34.521 --> 00:08:38.180
It's not useful.
Yeah.
Like I needed to learn how to box first.

146
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:41.660
And so then I started training that and then I started getting dry train with

147
00:08:41.661 --> 00:08:44.510
Moitai guys getting leg kicked.
I'm like,
ah fuck.

148
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.780
Cause if we were doing like above the waist kickboxing,

149
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:52.730
and then I saw Rick Rufus when he fought that a tie fighter,
you know,

150
00:08:52.731 --> 00:08:56.120
there's a really important fight when Rick fought this guy and the guy just

151
00:08:56.121 --> 00:08:58.160
chopped his fucking lays out Ronda.
I'm like,
ah.
