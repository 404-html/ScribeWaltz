WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
And he's a part of that lifestyle too.
Right.
But in a weird way,

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.580
he's a weird part of that lifestyle.
It's never been a jewel.

3
00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:08.290
That jewelry you seen isn't,
they're not really don't on,
I mean like,

4
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.560
but he's big on design and Ferrari's and Lamborghini's and beautiful houses and

5
00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:17.690
showing her that I'm aware of like wedding.
I know design.
Yeah.
No,

6
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.240
I know just from what I know of him that he longs to be Ralph Lauren,

7
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.830
but that's really has,
you know,

8
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.480
probably like if you said who is your biggest influence or who would you want to

9
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:35.220
be?
Ralph Lauren.
Yeah.
That's kind of hilarious.
But he just loves design.

10
00:00:35.221 --> 00:00:38.970
Right?
Loves clothes,
I guess.
Yeah.
I mean,

11
00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:43.590
why not somebody gotta I mean he knows all that stuff he was doing was looking

12
00:00:43.591 --> 00:00:45.310
like homeless people's clothing in.

13
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.010
It was like Daryl leaked right out of fucking sue lender.

14
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.180
Did you see that one video?
The picture that Jamie showed me,

15
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.820
he was walking around with slides,
easy slides on,

16
00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:57.120
but there were like four sizes too small.
It didn't make any sense.

17
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.950
He's like heels hanging off the back of them.
That's the way he designed it.

18
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.620
Exactly.
That's like he's probably trying to push a new thing.
He's like here,

19
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.450
tiny,
easy slides.
Too small for your feet to small Yeezy slides.
There you go.

20
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.170
Yeah,
that's the new look.
Like he,
you know,
if you're crazy,

21
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.600
you might think things like that.

22
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.720
That's crazy to me because there's an era of his career that I look at it and

23
00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:21.750
I'm like,
wow man,
there's a lot of genius shit.
He was doing musically,

24
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.280
a lot of records he was doing.
And then,
I don't know what it is,
but to me,

25
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.050
to me now,
and I don't say this really in a judgmental way,

26
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.060
but he's a professional troll now.

27
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.500
And just like that's the most successful people in the,

28
00:01:35.501 --> 00:01:37.200
in the entertainment business now,

29
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.710
if you're not an amazing actor or a super amazing,
you know,

30
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.610
whatever is like just keeping people troll.

31
00:01:43.611 --> 00:01:47.040
And I remember he literally dropped a song like at some point like eight months

32
00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:50.750
ago where that was like poop scoop,
scoop it.
He pooped,
he boop,
boop.

33
00:01:50.751 --> 00:01:54.170
The scoop buddy.
Whoop.
And that was the song.
It lasted that long.
Yeah.

34
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.670
Jamie came in and played it for me.
I already told me the lyrics.

35
00:01:56.671 --> 00:02:00.510
I can shut the fuck up.
No,
but it's like,
it's again,

36
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.230
it's the spectacle,
Jamie,
you stop putting this evil in my head,

37
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.200
it's the spectacle.
Like,
I mean,
I mean I made this album here.
That's music.
Yeah.

38
00:02:08.201 --> 00:02:11.250
You know what I mean?
This is music.
Lot of people don't give a fuck anymore.
Well,

39
00:02:11.251 --> 00:02:14.880
you're not that guy.
You've never been a,
I need publicity guy.
Well,

40
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.100
here's what it is.
Here's what that is.

41
00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:21.060
It's like people like to fucking speculate about what I do or my career.

42
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.923
You know what I mean?

43
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.370
I've written a few songs in this life that I could go somewhere and sit down and

44
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:29.730
just sit on a fucking stump and eat food for the rest of my life.

45
00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:31.380
I'd never worry.
You know what I mean?

46
00:02:31.381 --> 00:02:33.750
I could feed my family and all that off of a few songs.

47
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.090
I make music because I love making music,
you know?

48
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.370
And of course you want people to listen.

49
00:02:38.371 --> 00:02:40.800
You want fucking the more people you know you want people you want,

50
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.790
but I don't,
I'm not,
I'm not.
Again,

51
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.180
one of the first things is the first time I ever came on your podcast was like,

52
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.240
I like going around gifts and sitting at the olive bar and fucking getting my

53
00:02:53.431 --> 00:02:57.420
all lives while my songs playing on the radio and the guys standing right next

54
00:02:57.421 --> 00:03:00.820
to me.
I had no fucking idea.
I don't that at all.
That doesn't bother me.

55
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.081
I love it.
Yeah,

56
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:05.830
you're not a need attention kind of a guy and some people are in that sort of

57
00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:10.810
part of their business.
Like it's this whole Kanye Donald Trump thing.
I just,

58
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.120
I wonder if that's trolling,

59
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.900
but I also wonder if what we were talking about earlier about car accidents and

60
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:19.360
brain damage.
I wonder if that's partly a little bit of everything,

61
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:23.980
but also the reason I,
I I,
I say it's trolling is because there's

62
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.490
likes and stuff.
When you get to car Dash-in Kanye west levels of,

63
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.920
and I'm sure you know this just,

64
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.530
you have four fucking million Instagram followers.

65
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.260
I didn't start Instagram until you told me to.
I know that,

66
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.790
but what I'm saying is like

67
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.450
you could monetize that shit really easily.
Those 4 million people,

68
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.300
you're not that.
You're not selling that shit out.
These people,

69
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.640
they are definitely monetize and I should fucking,

70
00:03:50.641 --> 00:03:53.610
when Kim cartilage and gets on there,
she doesn't give you a commercial,

71
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.280
but she'll tell you all,
I'm just using this new cream on my shit.

72
00:03:56.281 --> 00:03:57.114
You know what I mean?
Here,

73
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.450
somebody paid her a hundred fucking 50 grand for that post.
You know?

74
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.620
It's like that's,
that's so the more eyes the better.

75
00:04:04.621 --> 00:04:06.810
That's really what they're monetizing is like I can,

76
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.340
if I had 10 million people on my Instagram,
I could sell fucking posts.

77
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.970
The real problem with that is people don't believe them.
You know,
like you,

78
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.310
but their eyes are still on.
I,
if I say I like something,
it's because I like it.

79
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.100
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

80
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.980
<v 0>Like if if,
and this is,
people accuse me of having an ads,</v>

81
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.710
I never had a single ad on Instagram.

82
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.800
If I tell people about a product and people like,
what do you do?

83
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.230
You getting paid for this?
Like,
nope.
Nope.
Not just like it.
Yeah.
Sharon,
sorry.

84
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.150
I thought you might think is cool.
It's a cool,
I've done it a few times,

85
00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:39.450
but I usually say,
hey,
I'm not getting fucking paid.
I'm just telling you now.

86
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.590
I do now because it is not,
I like this.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

87
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.040
Plus I ain't got enough Instagram followers to get back
January.

88
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.280
They need,
Jamie was saying you need 70,000 that's the number.
First of all,

89
00:04:52.281 --> 00:04:55.200
I said,
I don't,
I don't,
you know,
I don't.
Yeah,
I know you don't give a fuck.

90
00:04:55.201 --> 00:04:56.700
But if you did,
if you were a chick with a fake,

91
00:04:56.701 --> 00:05:00.030
but you might be able to get a little,
I might have 4 million followers.

92
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.100
Yeah.
You might write,
you might have 20 look at this.

93
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.860
Kim Kardashians got 118 million followers.

94
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.180
Good googly McGlynn.
Okay.
And let's say,
what did they say?
If you're,

95
00:05:12.181 --> 00:05:16.470
if you're actually good at social media,
maybe 10% of your audience engages you.

96
00:05:16.471 --> 00:05:21.150
So that's still 10 million people that will engage with her.

97
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.060
It's a lot of fun people.
Fun.

98
00:05:24.061 --> 00:05:27.680
I believe I threw that number out there and just kinda sounds about right.
Yeah.

99
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.620
A lot of God damn people.
Woo.
Yeah.
It's a weird businessman.

100
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.750
It's famous now,
like when we were young,
famous was,
you know,

101
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.370
if you're on TV or the radio or you know,
movies,

102
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.500
if you did something in life,
I wrote a book,
wrote a play or a movie,

103
00:05:46.501 --> 00:05:51.440
you know what I mean?
Yeah.
Invented the plane and that's what got you favorites.

104
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.540
Now you just got to keep eyes on you doing fucked up shit.
