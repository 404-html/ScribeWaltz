WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.570
Why he was barbecued.

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.610
That's where I started to believe secondhand smoke is a real thing.
It's fucking,

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.570
yeah.
I didn't think it was until then.
People that don't think it's real.

4
00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:12.060
It's great.
When we used to mock tape,
cause take didn't want to get high,

5
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.640
we would just smoke pot and Tate would have to stick his head out the window

6
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:16.050
like an ostrich.
Like what the fuck?

7
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.600
He was worried and you want to get hotbox and that's when we used to get vans.

8
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.740
Remember we used to get vans for awhile?
Conversion vans.
Yeah.

9
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.780
We would rent vans because it was so many of us would come.

10
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.360
Yeah,
we would entourage it.
Red Redman would film it.

11
00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:38.280
We would just have shenanigans and every town we went to
you of course.

12
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.350
And then Eddie Tate and red band as the non comedians and then me and Dunkin or

13
00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:47.980
me and Diaz or whatever.
Um,
there was a shitload of us.
Yeah.

14
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.790
So fuck six people and then we would feast.

15
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.330
We'd go to these fucking amazing restaurants.
Fogo a lot.

16
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.120
We went to a lot of photos.
It brings me back to one of my memories.

17
00:00:57.121 --> 00:01:01.260
I believe it was Cincinnati was nearby right near the hotel.

18
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.780
Do you want US Korea?
Yeah,
right across the street.
Yeah,

19
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.940
as relieving fucking newly a botox.

20
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.260
When I came in,
I'm like,
dude,
that's fucking Vandelay and he was,

21
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.880
he was the most fierce pregame fighter.
The way he'd look at you like,

22
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.410
I want to kill you.
Protecting this flight.

23
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.030
Nobody was scary than him in his prime cro.

24
00:01:22.031 --> 00:01:25.470
Cop was scary because he would just be so calm like I don't care,
let's do this.

25
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.490
Cop stared him down more than anybody ever stared Vandelay town.

26
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.220
He wouldn't break.
It could well have cro.
Cop was a straight up killer.

27
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.690
Croatia,
Croatian antiterrorist squad.

28
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.710
They begged for mercy and I've showed them and he's a world class kickboxer like

29
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:44.340
he wasn't afraid of Vandelay strike and he was a heavyweight and Vandelay really

30
00:01:44.341 --> 00:01:48.270
wasn't a heavyweight.
But anyway,
we saw him checking in,
then we went to eat.

31
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.090
He was in that true husker Rhea 15 minutes late.

32
00:01:51.091 --> 00:01:54.750
Like he threw his shit down and came in.
They were like so excited about,
look,

33
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.980
look at Cro cop.
Wow
Dude,

34
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.840
nobody's stared down cro cop back then that was when cro cop was at the peak.

35
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.300
It was Japanese got going through his routine and he's like fuck.

36
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.110
And I'm pretty sure was before,
uh,

37
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.390
Cro cop really had sort of mastered MMA.

38
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.690
He was coming over as a straight kickboxer and they had different rules for him.

39
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.860
The rules for Cro cop where like you can only fight on the ground for like 30

40
00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:21.100
seconds.
They had like,
yeah.

41
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.840
And if the fight went to a distance it would be a draw.
Yeah,

42
00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:29.841
because he really didn't have a lot of experience with take down defense or any

43
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:33.480
MMA fighting back then.
And the,
I didn't get botox.

44
00:02:33.481 --> 00:02:37.200
He had his face reconstructed cause his nose,
he had been in so many brawls,

45
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.150
his nose had completely flattened.

46
00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:43.020
We couldn't breathe out of it and he had so much scar tissue over his eyes that

47
00:02:43.021 --> 00:02:47.430
his eyes were drooping down so he'd get cut instantly.
Any,
any punched him,

48
00:02:47.431 --> 00:02:49.300
it hit him,
would open them up like a gas.

49
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.150
And he and his nose was completely flatch.

50
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.730
So they took a chunk of his rib and rebuilt his nose and he had his nose built

51
00:02:56.731 --> 00:02:58.650
big so he could breathe out of it more.

52
00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.860
And then he had all the scar tissue from his eyebrows and then pull back.

53
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.350
And according to Dana,
I dunno,

54
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.090
but then it was like he got it done in Brazil on the cheap and it just like

55
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.620
wasn't,
it didn't,
they didn't really make them look like Vander.
Wow.

56
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.110
So he went from Vandelay Silva.

57
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.400
It's like Vandelay Silva has the most profound facial form change in all of MMA

58
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.080
because he went from pretty,

59
00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:28.081
if go back [inaudible] Silva Vandelay Silva versus go to Vandelay Silva versus

60
00:03:29.771 --> 00:03:34.660
Dan Henderson one.
When they first fought in pride,
he,
he was a normal,

61
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.930
actually pretty good looking guy,
like regular good looking guy.

62
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.770
And then by the time he left pride,
his face was just smashed in.

63
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.330
By the time he fought chocolate Dell,

64
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.950
his face was just smashed and his nose had been literally flattened.
Wow.

65
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.850
For from punches and kicks and not just from fights,
but also from training.

66
00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:56.851
The training that he did it shoot to box and Cora Tiba was fucked up.

67
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.670
Fucked up.
That also okay would bring me to another thing.

68
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.680
We got to go to Brazil one time.
We didn't do a show that time,

69
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.590
but that's him versus Dan Henderson could make that a little bigger so you can

70
00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:12.610
see.
Yeah,
super normal kid.
Just a normal looking bad ass.

71
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.860
That was the first fight we fought.

72
00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:19.550
Dan Henderson Chin looks like as it's drawn on dies.
Somebody fucked up

73
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.700
bone.
Yeah,
Jay Leno and hymns,

74
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.410
that picture of annually above that with the eye all fucked up.

75
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.490
That was him from that fight.
Oh really?

76
00:04:28.491 --> 00:04:31.780
And Henderson connected with a haymaker of a right hand and fucked up his eyes.

77
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.400
Smile on that.
Like look at this bad.
Look at this cool picture on by the tick.

78
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.300
But do you mean look at vandelays face there in comparison to his face later on

79
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.540
his career?
Totally different.
Dan Henderson looks exactly the same.

80
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.810
He looks like the same guy.
He's just an other version.

81
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.620
He might be one of the toughest guys ever lived.
So tough.
Yeah.

82
00:04:50.621 --> 00:04:54.610
Dan is just a fucking little that picture up there with the tattoos and the

83
00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:58.630
shoulders go to that one.
Now that's him after facial reconstruction,

84
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.500
make that larger c that's after the facial reconstruction is settled in,

85
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.750
you know.
Oh we saw him right then and he just fought real recently.

86
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.090
A couple of weeks ago.
He's still fighting gun knocked out by rampage.

87
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.410
Rampage flatlined them.
Wow.
Yeah.
Pay Just so fun to,
Yup.

88
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.320
Rampage still carries that power.

89
00:05:17.321 --> 00:05:22.321
That was when he KOD rampage Kao to him in the UFC with him through the ring,

90
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.200
through the rain.
Pride was one of the coolest.
Yeah,
I saw that later.
I mean I,

91
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.900
you know,
way later you come to the UFC and it's like all these highlights,

92
00:05:31.901 --> 00:05:36.840
this backlog of highlights of MMA,
especially if the UFC purchase price.
Yeah.

93
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.860
Rio was really cool.
Yeah.
That's a place to go.

94
00:05:41.861 --> 00:05:45.280
And actually that fight that in terms of the audience response,

95
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.410
the two biggest ones were Sylvia couture in Columbus.

96
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.910
First time they'd ever been in Columbus.

97
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.100
And that real fight Joseph Aldo versus uh,
that was a Chad Mendez,
right?

98
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.700
Which one?
The one in Brazil,
wasn't it?
It was a spinning back kick.
Oh,

99
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:06.260
that was Terry.
Adam versus a Edson Barboza dude from d from fight,

100
00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:09.830
one of the undercard the place was so that you could feel it shaking.

101
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.910
And I remember them chanting something in the crowd cause Dana did smart.

102
00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:17.330
It's one of the first foreign ones and he made a Brazilian fighter on every,

103
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.553
on every fight.

104
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.250
He fucked up a little by having a couple of times Brazilian versus Brazilian,

105
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.970
but at every fight and they were chanting something in the audience.
Yeah.

106
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.470
You were like,
you were able to the translator,
like,

107
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.040
what are they saying you're going to die?
It was like,
oh my God.

108
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.590
Oh my God.
Yeah.
They didn't play games,
man.
Oh my God.

109
00:06:36.591 --> 00:06:38.300
That's when they were like legit.
And I believed it.

110
00:06:38.301 --> 00:06:40.430
Like we've got to figure out how we're gonna get Chelsea on and out of here.

111
00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.040
Fights Anderson here.
And I'm like,
come on.
And then you go there,
you're like,
oh,

112
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:47.120
I believe it now.
Yeah.
Well,
they're fiercely,
fiercely nationalistic.
