00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.500
If some of that news that you're getting in these traditional venues is fake.

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.170
It is dangerous.
If any of it is click baity of any of it is deceptive,

3
00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:12.360
not agree with you more.
It's fucking dangerous.

4
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.070
Especially because we have a president who attacks the presses and the,

5
00:00:15.071 --> 00:00:18.570
and remember like,
let's not forget the context.
We're operating it.
Yes.
You know,

6
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.720
we have Trump calling us the enemy of the people.
So crazy.

7
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.040
The lack of understanding of history in some people's insane,
you know,

8
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.270
for sure there were easy to drive in saying though,
let's be honest,

9
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.150
there's a lot of dummies out there.
That's part of the problem.
It's just,

10
00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:36.840
it's so easy to prod a certain group and the like,
I'm done.

11
00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:40.140
I'm going to do something about this.
This is,
this is the danger.

12
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.290
This is what you have to worry about.
That people that they,
and again,

13
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:45.960
they're signaling to,
they're signaling to the far right.

14
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.140
They're signaling to those people.
I know a lot of people like that.

15
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:50.730
Not that would,
you know,
shoot people.

16
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.240
But I know a lot of people that are signalers that like far right's signalers,

17
00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:55.660
like they'll see things and I've,

18
00:00:55.661 --> 00:00:59.070
I've talked to people that I hope Trump wins cause we've got to put a stop to

19
00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:02.880
all this nonsense.
What's the nonsense?
It's progressive nonsense.

20
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:03.930
The idea of socialist,

21
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:06.600
like Bernie Sanders is going to come along and take all your money.

22
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:09.990
We're struggling hard working Americans.
We've got to put America first,

23
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.700
put America first.

24
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.910
It's this lack of understanding about the complexity of the entire landscape,

25
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.070
the entire landscape in terms of economics,

26
00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:24.480
the entire landscape in terms of international politics,
all of it,
all the above,

27
00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:26.160
the,
the war machine,
the entire,
the,

28
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.580
the lack of understanding about the military industrial complex and the

29
00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:32.760
influence that it has,
the lack of understanding about the bankers,

30
00:01:32.761 --> 00:01:37.761
about how few people went to jail after the fucking crazy economic collapse that

31
00:01:37.861 --> 00:01:39.120
we just recovered from.
