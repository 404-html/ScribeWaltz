1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
At mind with three bullets.
I was thinking that the other day about marriage,

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.100
that marriage is essentially Russian roulette with three bullets

3
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.440
because one's going to die first.
50% of marriages end in divorce.

4
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.590
Then there's the Chris rock line.
That's just,
he goes,

5
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:16.650
that's just the people that had the courage to get out.
He's like,

6
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:21.030
how many cowards is stay in suffer.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So true.

7
00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:24.480
True Catholic.
So true.
Yeah,
and this is coming from a guy who's happily married,

8
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.840
but that's when I,
when I see people who are about to get married,
I go,
Oh,

9
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.840
good Lord.
Yeah.
Well,
you're married.
Yeah.
As I said,

10
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.410
this is coming from guy was happily married.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It works.

11
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.920
Which I'm a Chris Rock.
He's divorced.
He's divorced.
No,
I mean,
but me,

12
00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:40.480
I see people get married and I'm like,
Oh yeah.

13
00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:44.210
It's always assumed was that I always tell people like,
yeah,
I'm married a man.

14
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.440
Happy.
I love it.
Don't do it.
Yeah.
Don't do as too risky,
dude.

15
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.970
That's why I got to have you on advice from a dipshit because Amanda will call

16
00:00:50.971 --> 00:00:53.280
through and she'll get like marriage advice.

17
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.330
We have a lot every single month that people call in and say,
hey man,
should I,

18
00:00:57.331 --> 00:01:00.120
should I?
Blah,
blah,
blah.
You can't give people advice because first of all,

19
00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:04.020
there is no fucking way.
I know how you actually are together when you're alone.

20
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.730
I don't know that,
but it's advice from a dip shit,
so I can go by myself and go,

21
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.980
just make sure you're doing this,
this,
this,
and this,

22
00:01:10.981 --> 00:01:13.950
and then you're on your fucking own.
You know?
They're not quote me.

23
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.030
You should have Dr Laura on your show ever be mean to my God.
Be Amazing.
