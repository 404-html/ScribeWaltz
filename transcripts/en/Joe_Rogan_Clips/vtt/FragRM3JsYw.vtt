Hello

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.070
<v 1>Freak bitches.
There was two guys that were talking about your podcast.</v>

3
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:06.150
It was fucking hilarious.

4
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.030
They were talking about Lee Lee Saya and they were like,

5
00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:12.540
what Joey has done to that poor guy.
And he's like,
every time he sees him,

6
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.530
he's forcing them to eat mushrooms.
He's got to take acid.
He's giving him pot.

7
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.710
He's given him edibles.
He's lied to him about the dosage

8
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.220
lead.
Loves it.
He loves it.
He does.
He's just did the,

9
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:30.360
we did that liquid acid with the ice cube with the sugar cubes.
Jesus Christ.

10
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.840
But two weeks ago we did it two nights in a row.
Was hilarious on the show.

11
00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:36.240
He did it.
Yeah.
And then he called me the next day.
He's like,
that was fun.

12
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.251
He goes,

13
00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:41.970
I went to cvs at four in the morning if he wasn't like that before he met you

14
00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:45.030
though.
No,
but he's having a great,
you turn that kid into a freak.

15
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.960
He's not a freak man.
I turned them into a functioning savage,

16
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.810
but I love him like a high level with all my heart because he makes me,

17
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.440
he makes me laugh so much.
Joe,
like he just,
you know,

18
00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:02.250
I'm 54 it's 28 he's half my age.
Right.
You know,

19
00:01:02.251 --> 00:01:05.070
I see life from his perspective,
you know,
and I'm like,
Geez,

20
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.670
these guys get along together.
Great.
It's like a great dynamic.

21
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:11.220
The two of you together,
it works really well.
Oh,
I love,

22
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.480
I don't see him too much during the week,
so I keep the relationship fresh.

23
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.470
We talk all the time.
I torment the mall.
The other day I called him,
I go,

24
00:01:19.471 --> 00:01:21.420
what the fuck is wrong with you?
Because what are you talking about?
God,

25
00:01:21.421 --> 00:01:25.520
he just got a letter from the state.
Why is your fucking phone pat?
Hmm?

26
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.740
I torment for them for 20 minutes about his phone,
man.
Why?
Why?
Why?

27
00:01:29.741 --> 00:01:32.460
By bound feed that.
I go,
do you work for the CIA?

28
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.080
They made you come over and take my acid so you can report back to them.

29
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.220
<v 0>What the fuck is wrong with you?</v>

30
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.690
<v 1>Ah,
that's it.
Don't worry about it must have been a mistake.</v>

31
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.470
And the guy got me the liquid acid,
right?
I called him and I said,

32
00:01:54.471 --> 00:01:56.490
listen,
I got a liquid asset.
He's like,

33
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.380
you can hear him getting anxiety on the phone.
He goes,
oh no,

34
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.490
you were a little bit,
and then he goes,
how are we going to do it?
I said,

35
00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:06.890
so we're going to get sugar cubes and put the acid on it,

36
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.550
but I called them back like a day later that I didn't have no acid and I had no

37
00:02:10.551 --> 00:02:13.670
sugar cubes.
I just made it up.
I go,
listen,

38
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.190
I just put the acid on the cube of sugar cubes.

39
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.070
I put them in a Tupperware and I put a lid on it and I left him.

40
00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:20.510
When I came back to Lynn had blown up,

41
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.260
so whenever is of that acid is going to be really fucking strong.
I go,

42
00:02:24.261 --> 00:02:25.610
I put aluminum foil over.

43
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.410
It would hold so it could breathe so the acid won't fucking go into all my God.

44
00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:33.590
I had them go for three weeks.
I go to Cleveland.
Guess what?

45
00:02:33.591 --> 00:02:36.110
Some guy comes up to me,
gives me a two basket.
This is,

46
00:02:36.111 --> 00:02:40.050
this is the pharmaceutical grade shit.
This will kill Gaddafi.
The home.

47
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.670
I go home,
we put drops on each ice cube.
I need sugar cube.

48
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.410
Oh my fucking God.
Yeah.
But see again,

49
00:02:51.411 --> 00:02:55.160
that's why I quit everything because my tolerance is too hot.
Back in the day,

50
00:02:55.161 --> 00:02:58.880
I could do two drops,
Ibi for 12 hours,
seeing things.
UNICORNS.

51
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.250
I seen something for like two hours,
but you knows what,

52
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.170
how strong it really was to,
and you're getting it from Cleveland.
Yeah.

53
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.080
Got To get it from like northern California.
Oh,
no,
no.
But then I lost,

54
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.790
I lost the 10 sheet from a guy in England.
A Guy in England gave me some stuff.

55
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.900
Pink Floyd acid.
This the same one that Syd Barrett took when he quit pink Floyd.

56
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.100
So I took that.
I save that.
So now I'm going to get the liquid acid.

57
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:23.560
I'm going to put it on the blotter from pink Floyd and we're going to go deep.

58
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.870
I'm just saving that one for a good guest.

59
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.960
<v 2>Yeah.</v>
