00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.570
Hello Freak bitches.
I mean,

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.400
after we do a few episodes here will be like,
oh,
it's just,
this is the spot.

3
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.170
I'm sure if I companion.
Yeah.

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.460
Especially once the booze and starts again once the Busan and the weeds start

5
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:18.900
again in November.
How hard has that been for you?
Easy.
Super easy.

6
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.093
Click is eat.

7
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.340
The other day went to Mexican food and I wanted a Margarita and I went,
oh damn,

8
00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:27.930
I can't have Margaret.
Yeah,
that's it.
That's literally my only craving.

9
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.310
People talk to you about like,
cause their initial thing wasn't quitting.

10
00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:36.720
We'd write,
the initial thing was just getting Bert Kreischer to not die.

11
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.320
So like our idea was like,
let's see if we can get them to go sober for a month.

12
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.220
Yeah.
And he was like,
I can run a marathon.
I'm like,
stop.
He fucked this.

13
00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:46.980
You're not going to run a marathon.
Well like,
listen,

14
00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:49.050
how about instead of you running a marathon,

15
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:51.990
we just have you do 15 hot yoga classes.
And they're like,
oh,

16
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:54.590
that'd be easy when she hasn't,
haven't even done one yet.

17
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.800
You don't know if it's easy and now they're,
they're slogging away through like,

18
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.590
I think they're,
they're all at like number six or seven.
Right.

19
00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:06.270
Do we have video of a bird in a hot yoga class?
No.
Video.
No,
but they've,

20
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.540
they take videos after him and Tom get out and they're both,
you know,

21
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.230
beat red and it's covered in sweat.
It's pretty,
obviously Alice just drenched.

22
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.750
But Burton has done amazing.
First of all,
his,

23
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.880
his blood pressure has dropped radically.

24
00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:21.120
He was actually on high blood pressure medication.

25
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.760
And after this,

26
00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:27.150
after stopping drinking just immediately his blood pressure dropped like

27
00:01:27.151 --> 00:01:28.160
radically.
Yeah.

28
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.770
So like he doesn't even need blood pressure medication if he doesn't drink.

29
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.940
That's amazing.
It's the only thing that it's doing in men is the booze.
Right.
So,

30
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.890
and then,
but people would come up to me about the,

31
00:01:37.891 --> 00:01:41.760
we'd see the weed wasn't in the original bet.
The original bet was just no booze,

32
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.850
which I thought it'd be pretty easy.
And then they're like,
all right,

33
00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:48.870
we're going to go no,
no weed too.
And I was like,
no weed.
Fuck you.
Like,

34
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.160
I'm just doing this for Burton.
Like I don't want to stop smoking.

35
00:01:51.161 --> 00:01:53.040
And then they were giving me a hard time about it.

36
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:56.400
They started this Hashtag pray for Joe Campaign Cause I was addicted to pot.

37
00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.700
So I initially thought I'll just get off weed and not tell them until the end

38
00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:05.120
and go.
It was fucking easy.
Pussies.
Yeah.
But then our,

39
00:02:05.121 --> 00:02:07.650
he was making such a big deal out of it.
I would say actually dude,

40
00:02:07.651 --> 00:02:10.200
I'm not smoking pot either just to let the cat out of the bag.

41
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.800
Thompson I already knew.
But um,
people come up to you like,

42
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.370
like you're not eating for a month like you.
Okay.
Yeah.
Right,
right.

43
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:21.040
How do you feel you off heroin for good,
you know,

44
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.070
but it's such a part of it for you isn't it?

45
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.390
Never seemed like an addiction.
Drugs too.

46
00:02:27.391 --> 00:02:32.391
For my vision of you doing drugs is it's always mind expanding and it's always

47
00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:37.770
just to relax.
It's never like an addiction.
It never felt like you needed to.

48
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.580
I definitely don't need it obviously,
because that's a great sets too,

49
00:02:41.581 --> 00:02:43.860
which has been very interesting because I usually like to go on stay tie.

50
00:02:43.861 --> 00:02:48.630
I haven't done that at all though.
No,
no pot for 17 days.

51
00:02:48.631 --> 00:02:53.400
Is that what today is?
What's today?
The 17th so no pot for 17 days.

52
00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:58.110
Where do you miss it the most before going on?
No,
I haven't missed it.

53
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.160
Wow.
It's been weird.
You know?
I was like,

54
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:02.350
maybe there's going to be a moment where like,
wow,
I'd like to have some weak.

55
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.170
I'm a little nervous about smoking again.
Yeah.

56
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.710
Because I know I'm going to get so high that I'm so paranoid and all these

57
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.500
demons are going to come creeping up into my consciousness again.

58
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.680
Paranoid.
Yeah.
Psychic demons.
It is going to come float and by,

59
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.430
it's like that first orgasm after you get your prostate removed.
Yeah,
man.

60
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:26.020
For Real.
You know,
like once,
once you're back,
you know,
it's just,

61
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.960
just seems like,
um,
it seems like it's going to hit your way,
way,

62
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:35.020
way harder,
right?
That's what everybody says.
Yeah.

63
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.970
You take a month off and then he'd get back on the pot.

64
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:39.940
Then you know why everybody freaks out when you get them high.
You know,

65
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:44.620
because we're so used to getting high that will we get high.
It's no big deal.

66
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.040
Yeah.
But when people don't get high and they're like,
oh,

67
00:03:47.041 --> 00:03:49.810
I'll smoke a little weed with you,
but they haven't smoked pot.

68
00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:53.080
Maybe like six months or something like that.
Yeah.
Those people are fucked.
Right?

69
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.040
They're in a bad place.

70
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.660
<v 1>Yeah.
I got a nice easy rhythm gone.</v>

71
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.590
I got the little vape pen and I'm seeing what?
I'm a mom on the road,
you know,

72
00:04:01.591 --> 00:04:06.270
Thursday,
Friday night,
couple hits.
That's pretty much it.

73
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.720
<v 0>And you never do it before shows,
right?
Never.
Never,
ever.</v>

74
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.240
And you took a long time.
Like when,
when I first met you,
we back in the day,

75
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.370
um,
when we first started out,
you would just quit boots,
right?
Like just quit.

76
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.360
Yeah.
And you weren't doing nothing.
No Pot,
no booze,
no nothing.
Like,

77
00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:28.490
what was it that made you realize I could smoke little,

78
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.990
<v 1>it was new year's eve</v>

79
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:32.443
<v 2>of</v>

80
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.760
<v 1>I turned 49,
2004.
Whoa.</v>

81
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.910
So I had not smoked pot for 14 years or drank or anything.

82
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.150
And then I'm standing outside of the Improv in San Francisco and I'm with,

83
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.710
I won't mention the manager's name,

84
00:04:49.711 --> 00:04:53.540
but a manager who smokes a lot of pot that we all know and love.
And uh,

85
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.020
the entire cast of the marijuana logs has Doug Benson,
Tony,
uh,

86
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.540
can mean and,
um,

87
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.860
Brian Poe sane and they're all there.
It's just like a weird thing where,

88
00:05:04.861 --> 00:05:07.620
you know,
I don't know if you've ever done New Year's eve in San Francisco,

89
00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:10.920
but there's like three different venues at all,
do comedy,
you know,

90
00:05:10.921 --> 00:05:14.760
there's Cobbs is the punchline and then there's a big theater that the Palai the

91
00:05:14.761 --> 00:05:16.080
palace of fine arts or whatever.

92
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.940
And then there's an after party at the punchline and it's the greatest after

93
00:05:20.941 --> 00:05:24.540
party because usually you go on the road and after your show you're just kind of

94
00:05:24.541 --> 00:05:27.210
alone.
Maybe you got to your opener or whatever and you hang out.

95
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:28.860
But this is always like,
you know,

96
00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:33.060
every comic in San Francisco comes together and I'm standing out front end and

97
00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:35.110
they're standing there with a joint.
They hand it to me and I just,

98
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.610
I felt like this is the moment I'm supposed to smoke pot again.

99
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.760
And I did.
And uh,

100
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.010
and then the weirdest fucking thing happened is,
um,

101
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.130
I went down to help Molly,
you know,
she had a,
um,

102
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.400
the van coming from the palace and she had a box of booze that had been the

103
00:05:53.401 --> 00:05:58.401
backstage bar and she's a bottle of vodka and she's walking towards the steps

104
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.900
and his group,

105
00:06:02.901 --> 00:06:06.320
and we were talking about San Francisco homeless people before group of like,

106
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.940
you know,
they're like 21 and they're like,
Streeter.
Chin's yeah.
They're like,

107
00:06:10.941 --> 00:06:14.720
you know,
it's almost like,
yeah,
the warrior come out.

108
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.610
It's like that type of person.

109
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.050
And they grabbed the bottle of booze out of Molly's hand and I'm standing there

110
00:06:21.051 --> 00:06:25.880
with Todd Barry,
Paul f Tompkins,
and like,
I think Greg Proops,

111
00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:27.200
it's like two guys in suits.

112
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.190
And so they grabbed this bottle for Molly and she chases after them.
I'm like,

113
00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:35.330
what the fuck are you doing this that your booze?
It's the clubs,
booze.

114
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.440
And she runs right in the middle of them and they,
uh,

115
00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:44.441
she grabs a bottle and she's fighting with this woman over it and these guys are

116
00:06:45.081 --> 00:06:49.580
surrounding her and I run in and I grab her and start pulling her out.

117
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:50.990
But at the same time,
guys,

118
00:06:50.991 --> 00:06:55.910
a fist cocked waiting to take a shot at me and I'm yelling to these guys,

119
00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:00.380
hey,
how about a little help here and nothing.
And so,
uh,

120
00:07:00.381 --> 00:07:04.370
I kind of pull her out of there and we have run away.

121
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.560
And then as we're walking up the stairs,

122
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.060
they throw a blockbuster and mad oh,
Jesus.

123
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.480
And it landed right near us and it blew out.

124
00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:18.690
O and m there was less.
People don't know what that means is a firecracker.
Oh,

125
00:07:18.691 --> 00:07:22.130
like a super bits and eighth of a stick of dynamite isn't really that.

126
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.880
That's what an mat is.
Jesus Christ.
I didn't know.
Is that powerful?
Yeah.
I mean,

127
00:07:25.881 --> 00:07:27.470
you feel it in your chest.

128
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:33.100
And a blew out Molly's hearing for like a year and,

129
00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:37.850
uh,
people were crying.
It was like really traumatic and I'm high.

130
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:42.620
I'm like,
this is the fucking war.
After 14 years,

131
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.020
I was just like,
fuck,
this is nuts.

132
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:49.730
I was walking the girl back to the hotel because she was sobbing.
I wasn't tig.

133
00:07:49.731 --> 00:07:54.080
It was a,
it was a lesbian comedian who had a girlfriend weather and uh,

134
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.530
yeah.
It was fucking crazy.
Whoa.
Yeah.

135
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:07.780
<v 3>Okay.</v>
