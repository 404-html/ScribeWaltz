WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.660
But,
uh,
so is a super random,

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.880
who's the best podcast you've ever had?

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.620
Every time I think I have the best podcasts.

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.030
We'll have another one that's better.

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.290
I talked to someone that I respect recently and they said that the Elan Musk one

6
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.100
was the best podcast ever.
It's pretty damn good in history.
Yeah.

7
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.310
That one was rather best podcasts in history.
That's a strong word.

8
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.360
That's podcasts ever been made?
Well,
he's such a unique mind.

9
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.520
I mean he just,
they just,

10
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.200
he just posted a video of one of the boring tunnels first,
uh,

11
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.620
completed tunnels.
And so the,
let's see,
agile.
Yeah,

12
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.610
it's an insanely long tunnel through La and they,

13
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.530
they've been doing this only for a few months,

14
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.830
but apparently in December they're going to start doing this.

15
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:50.340
Like look how long this is.
This is inside La.

16
00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:55.341
I mean this is at his actual completed real tunnel that's underneath la right

17
00:00:56.191 --> 00:00:58.510
now.
Kay.
Can we talk about how there's no like,
like,

18
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.890
like a prototype that we heard about is like,
all of a sudden it was just like,

19
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.480
how do you get a,
who owns the land underneath?
That's a real good question.
I,

20
00:01:05.481 --> 00:01:08.130
I don't think he understood what I was asking when I asked him that.
I'm like,

21
00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:11.280
how do you,
how do you do this?
Like who do you ask to do this?

22
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.920
Like all of a sudden he's called my project manager.
I'm like,
no,

23
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:17.210
but they started seeing shit under someone's house.
Yeah.

24
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.070
Like what does or has decided to make a law.

25
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.140
Well and they want to dig under their house to make a well and they go through

26
00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:24.180
the roof of your tunnel.
Are they allowed to,

27
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.310
I love that there's humans like him that are thinking on such a massive scale

28
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.440
that are trying to fix the biggest problems that humans are facing that got tons

29
00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:35.620
of dough.

30
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.280
You guys like you were out there riding waves and I'm telling Dick Jokes.

31
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.240
This guys digging holes under the earth.
Yeah.

32
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.370
I mean he's also sending cars in space.

33
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.390
Right?
He sent his own car.
He shot into space.
He's got space ex.

34
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.340
He's talking about colonizing Mars.

35
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.230
He's got a Tesla company that makes the best electric cars on the planet earth.

36
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.650
I mean,
he's got so many different things going on simultaneously.

37
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:05.040
I just don't understand his capacity for work.
He's trying to,

38
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.350
he's trying to fix the energy,
you know,
the energy problem with,
you know,

39
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.320
you know,
getting energy from,
from the sun to power your house to power your car,

40
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.840
power cities.
And you know,
I'm like,
it's crazy.

41
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.440
He makes solar panels now that are actually tiles for your roof,
for your house,

42
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.930
a solar roof credible.

43
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.680
Like you replaced the tiles on your roof with these solar tiles.
Solar.
