WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.350
And how,
how people are attached to that.
You know,
that they,
they,
they,

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.820
they immediately think that this is something to mock and make fun of.
You know?

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.350
I mean,
it was almost universal.

4
00:00:10.351 --> 00:00:14.430
So many people were doing stories on that guy bagging groceries.
Yeah.

5
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.060
<v 1>It's the age we live in,
man.
People want to see people break.</v>

6
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.200
If anybody's doing anything,
there's a chance they're just waiting.

7
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.190
People are so mad.
Look,
if,
if Megan Kelly,

8
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.450
if we didn't know what her contract was,
right?
If it was just some,
in fact,

9
00:00:31.451 --> 00:00:32.470
let's say we did know,

10
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.610
and let's say she was getting paid barely what we would ever gas,
right?

11
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.320
Let's say she's getting paid,
I don't know,
$100,000 a year at her new job at NBC,

12
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.290
she probably still had the job.
She prepped,
right?

13
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.470
I mean it's the whole crazy part is that we all know she got paid $68 million

14
00:00:49.871 --> 00:00:54.620
for three years for what?
Right.
That's the whole take.
So it's like,

15
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.090
you know what Ghana people are watching,

16
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.920
like what'd she just say about Halloween costume?
That's it.
We got it.

17
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.600
We got her.
Yeah.

18
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.710
Did you ever hear it play it Megan Kelly?
Shit.

19
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.970
What do you guys have?
Like the apology or the original?
No,

20
00:01:12.971 --> 00:01:15.190
the apology was hilarious.
This woman

21
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.120
<v 0>said that some woman from Australia said that it seems like a hostage video.</v>

22
00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:22.000
The only thing that is missing is her holding up a newspaper with a date on it.

23
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.170
I retweeted all I,
it's soda.
And then somebody else said,
well,
what if you,

24
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.213
there's one of the,

25
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.250
one of the things about it that's so strange is how insincere it seems like

26
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.300
forced like,
oh,
it's from a forester.

27
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.810
<v 1>It's her apology.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Apology seen the forest.
Yeah.
No,</v>

28
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:41.653
I haven't seen that yet.

29
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.790
<v 0>But the boots,
forget the apology.
Let's play the actual videos.</v>

30
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.810
Actually I remember,
if I remember correctly,
it's two comments.

31
00:01:46.811 --> 00:01:48.650
She makes one of them,
they come back.
Oh,

32
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.270
the second comment I think was the real issue.
What was the first comment I,

33
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.420
I gotta get,
I'm don't,
I remember,
I don't remember.

34
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.450
<v 2>So there was a controversy on the real housewives of New York with Luanne and</v>

35
00:01:59.451 --> 00:02:03.740
she dresses Diana Ross and she made her skin looked darker than it really is and

36
00:02:03.741 --> 00:02:06.440
people said that that was racist and I don't know.

37
00:02:06.441 --> 00:02:08.600
I thought like who doesn't love Diana Ross?

38
00:02:08.601 --> 00:02:10.550
She wants to look like Diana Ross for one day.

39
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.700
I don't know how that got racist on Halloween

40
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.950
<v 0>peered to be.
I'll see.
That's the first one
is it?</v>

41
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.320
But it's weird when you watch it now.
Like you know,

42
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.000
this is her demise.

43
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.250
I like you're watching the stumble when she trips off the rock and falls off the

44
00:02:30.251 --> 00:02:34.060
cliff.
This is the stumble,
like I don't get it.

45
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.960
How is that racist to want to be Diana Ross and then play it again?

46
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.150
<v 2>Yeah,
Halloween like okay,
I could,</v>

47
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.310
I was a kid that was okay as long as you were addressing that.

48
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.330
There's like a character

49
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.110
<v 0>and that.
So some guys commentary from Wall Street Journal.</v>

50
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.290
That was a wrap for their and be my favorite one of hers that she ever said.

51
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.220
No.
My favorite one of hers,
if we were good.
Yeah.
My favorite,

52
00:02:58.221 --> 00:03:00.420
one of hers she ever said was,
uh,
there were,

53
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.520
there were doing this thing on Fox News about Santa Claus and someone had

54
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.410
something about Santa Claus being black.

55
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.760
They did something about Santa Claus being black and she just went,
ah,

56
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.110
well Santa Claus is definitely white.
And she was like,

57
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.260
I think she said it at kids like kids.
Santa Claus is definitely right.

58
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.450
Or it's kids.
Santa Claus is real and he's definitely white.
Like,

59
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.890
I forget what the exact terminology was,

60
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.670
but she basically said Santa Claus is definitely why like Santa Claus is in

61
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:31.030
fucking real.
Okay.
It's like saying Spiderman is definitely white.

62
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.640
She didn't get fired from Fox for saying that.

63
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:35.600
She probably got a raise for saying that.
Right.

64
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.280
They licked her toe is a whole different thing at Fox.
Well,

65
00:03:38.281 --> 00:03:42.150
it was then they don't want her to know.
Yeah,
she wanted to go back.
No,
no,

66
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.910
we're good.
Yeah.
They won't him to take her back.

67
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.500
The thing is you can't go from being an ice princess and the conservative right

68
00:03:49.501 --> 00:03:52.920
wing channel to being like Oprah.

69
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.630
What she's trying to be like Oprah.
I don't,
I,

70
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.620
I'll never really get what MBC was thinking there.

71
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.940
They were thinking it's a paper.
He was like,

72
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.940
those people are just going to come over.
Yeah,
that's exactly what they thought.

73
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.350
They thought she has a giant fan base,
but she had a fan base for sure.

74
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.150
Some came over,
but she,

75
00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:15.810
a lot of her fan weight of base was because she was the beautiful conservative

76
00:04:15.811 --> 00:04:19.680
woman who was a very tough,
very articulate,
very smart,

77
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.910
you know,

78
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.020
and they liked that she was an ice princess and she would shut people down if

79
00:04:25.021 --> 00:04:28.620
they're incorrect and she wouldn't let people talk over her.
She was powerful.

80
00:04:28.621 --> 00:04:30.390
Kind of frightening in a hot way.

81
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.483
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

82
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.090
<v 0>Fox News has a bunch of those chicks just waiting,</v>

83
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.400
waiting in the Helms delight that closet x Mokena when the dude opens it up and

84
00:04:41.401 --> 00:04:44.430
sees all these robots with different skin and faces.
And

85
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.880
there was so many of them just teleprompters ready to roll.
Big,

86
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.840
big letters that they can read.
It clearly will tell you what you like.
Yeah.

87
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.800
They're making a movie.
And these three are the,
uh,
the anchors.
Yeah.

88
00:04:58.801 --> 00:05:03.720
Fox News or Robbie,
Nicole Kidman,
and uh,
and meg Shirley's there on,

89
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.870
yeah.
I wouldn't mind being on the other end of that.
A porta potty.

90
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.790
How dare you see,
you could get fired for that.

91
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.060
Imagine if you were on a show and you've said that that would be the end.

92
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.140
Like that this is a beautiful thing about podcasts.
Yeah.

93
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.040
Nobody gives a fuck that you said that it has zero consequences,
but like,

94
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.550
let's,

95
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.390
let's pretend that you were on the tonight show and you were a guest and you're

96
00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:31.840
like,
I like being in the end of that porter potty.
People be like,
oh,

97
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.580
did he really,
really,

98
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.420
that woman was just tried to go to the restroom.

99
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.250
You think that's funny?
