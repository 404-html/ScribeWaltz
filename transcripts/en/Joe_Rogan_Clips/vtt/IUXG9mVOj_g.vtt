00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.840
Social media has really made everything annoying,
hasn't it?

2
00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.430
I think great too though.
Both do Twitter.
It's like,
look,

3
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.850
we're saying when someone says something dumb,

4
00:00:08.851 --> 00:00:11.190
like Trump will say something dumped sometimes and I'll just go there for the

5
00:00:11.191 --> 00:00:15.480
memes and I'll just read his post and it'll get me going in the more I'll get

6
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:18.930
like 15 minutes of ha ha's.
Probably miss the story yesterday.

7
00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:22.410
Have you heard any of the 21 savage news?
Oh,
he got deported,
right?

8
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.980
Because everyone found out yesterday that he's apparently from the UK.

9
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.240
And so like the story,
there's two stories that as part of the story,

10
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:35.241
but memes of him being from the UK and a British rapper that's Rosie from

11
00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:39.480
Atlanta really took over to the fact like Demi Lavato tweeted it and she got

12
00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:43.080
shit on and she's deleted her Twitter now because of the response to that.

13
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.090
Did you know who this guy was before?
No,
but I'm 51 years old.
Yeah.
Old Man.

14
00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:51.330
Number one.
I'm like,
Oh shit.
Number one write record.
And now like in the country,

15
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.160
really?
Jamie's on black Twitter cheese,
but you're on black Twitter.
Sure,

16
00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.620
sure.
It could be too.
I,
yeah,
my fall,

17
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.540
a lot of them and I don't know any of these like tech nines and Sushi fours

18
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.700
fucked that.
Takeshi.
Six.
Nine.
He's fucked.
Maybe.

19
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.260
What do you mean may blow the sand?
He's,
he's talking.
We might get a lot of,

20
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.000
he's still fucked.
He's fun.
He's fun.

21
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.870
He's going to jail for a long time with a tattoo of six,
nine on his face.

22
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.440
He's going to jail.
He's going to have real problems.
That ain't good there.

23
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.080
The man did you read the list of charges?
There's murder involved.
Murder.

24
00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:31.860
Conspiracy.
Oh,
of him supposedly calling a hit on someone.
Oh,

25
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:36.420
Jesus Christ.
Oh my God.
Oh,
he's fucked man.

26
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.920
Even if he cooperates,
if they put a hit on someone because he said it.
Jesus,

27
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.890
he'll,
he won't get like the death penalty,

28
00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:48.030
but now he wasn't being like life in prison.
You know someone's fleshlight.
Yeah.

29
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.090
Heck yeah.
It's a real problem.
Soldier boys in jail too,
isn't he?

30
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.660
Is for what got arrested.
I didn't.
Hey,
did what?

31
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.340
He beat up his girl and his girl beat him up.
No,
no,
that was a little bow.
Wow.

32
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.990
He was the son of a bitch.
You just shamed Soulja boy for no reason.

33
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.950
With your Shitty Pot,
adult memory weight as you son of a bitch.
Jamie's right.

34
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.090
I know.
It was a little bow.
Wow.
No,
there was something else.
Oh,
hold on.
Yup.
Nope.

35
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.390
He's accused of kidnapping a woman apparently.
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.960
So you got the stories conflated,
kidnapped,
because even worse,

37
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.370
he tied a girl to a,
uh,

38
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.190
a chair using an extension cord and kept her for six or seven hours and his

39
00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:30.930
garage hit.
Whoa.
Yeah.
Oh,
he's going to jail forever.
Prom.
What do you do that for?

40
00:02:30.931 --> 00:02:35.790
That someone's daughter wouldn't do that for a jealousy.
I think it said Ed.

41
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.800
This is apparently according to celebrity news outlet.

42
00:02:38.801 --> 00:02:42.910
The woman whose name I will not say apparently was backing out of a driveway in

43
00:02:42.911 --> 00:02:47.530
her car,
hit soldiers la home when she hit the curb at his house,

44
00:02:47.531 --> 00:02:49.240
when she hit the curb.
From that point on,

45
00:02:49.241 --> 00:02:53.020
his assistant reportedly became upset and started fighting with her from there.

46
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.930
Soldier allegedly stepped outside and tried to break up the fight.

47
00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.010
The woman says that he began punching and kicking her when she was on ground and

48
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:04.490
then tied her up for six hours.
God,

49
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.780
Soulja boy.
Well,

50
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.690
at least Nintendo one was cooler heads will prevail,

51
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.230
but that sounds like that sounds like a fucking disaster.

52
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.200
Jesus Christ.
You never hear about the spin doctors causing any problems,
right,

53
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:22.590
guys?
She hit a curb.
This all started.
She heard it.

54
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.980
She hit a curb with his car or something.
She's curved.

55
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.330
One was wheels on enough information on there.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Yeah.

56
00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:31.900
She probably curbed one of his wheels probably has a nice car and she didn't

57
00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:36.400
know what the fuck she was doing.
I got a job.
What?

58
00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:40.870
A Dick tied her up and beat her up.
That's Jesus' grace,
allegedly,

59
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.870
allegedly.
Right,
right,
right.
You got to always say that.
