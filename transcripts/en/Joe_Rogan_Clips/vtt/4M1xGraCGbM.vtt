1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.680
Niger quarter,
Lisa,
who was like,
they looked really similar.

2
00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:07.350
They shared a fake Id.
They were like sisters.

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.260
And one day when they were in the late teens,

4
00:00:10.261 --> 00:00:15.261
they went to ocean city for day out and Lisa decided to hitchhike back to New

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.570
Jersey where she lived.
And uh,

6
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.230
so Lisa bye to her and the next day she gets a call saying Lisa had not arrived.

7
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.060
So she waits and waits.

8
00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:26.580
She has this terrible summer waiting to find out what happened.

9
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.050
And then they discovered that Lisa had been gang raped and murdered.

10
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.480
Her body was found underneath a house where it had been eaten by animals.
Um,

11
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.690
and Lee becomes,
became convinced at that time that,

12
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.600
that Lisa had for spares reasons that Lisa had been killed as part of a gang

13
00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:45.820
initiation ceremony.
She like,
she's like,
I'm going to destroy these gangs,

14
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.640
going to dedicate my life to destroying these gangs.

15
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.930
She goes and applies to become a police officer and for years she's this,

16
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.350
you know,
hardline cop,
right?

17
00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.450
It takes real pleasure in busting people.
But Lee started to notice a few things.

18
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.880
First thing was when you're a cop and you arrest a rapist,

19
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.670
there are fewer rapes in your town the next week,
right?

20
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.510
When you are a cop and you bust a pedophile,
fewer children get sexually abused.

21
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.400
But she knows when you dropped buster dealer,
there's no fewer dealers.

22
00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:19.410
There's someone on the corner of the next day for sure.
Right?

23
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.230
It didn't seem to be having any effect.
In fact,
what she discovered,
what she was,

24
00:01:23.231 --> 00:01:26.940
she began to learn about this was that there was something,
uh,
even worse,

25
00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:27.774
which was,
um,

26
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.370
it for funny sort of reason that she realized that she was actually creating

27
00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:36.800
these empowering these gangs.
So the best way to explain this is if you imagine,

28
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.980
obviously when you,
when you ban drugs,
they don't disappear,
right?

29
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.380
That transfer from the people who are used to control them,

30
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.890
licensed legal businesses to armed criminal gangs,
right?

31
00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:49.310
And these aren't criminal gangs operate in a different way to,

32
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.210
to legal businesses.
So if you imagined,

33
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.020
if you and me decided we want to go and steal now a bottle of vodka,
right?

34
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.910
We go into local liquor store and that store catches us,
they'll call the cops.

35
00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:01.170
The cops would come and take us away.

36
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.200
That liquor store doesn't need to be violent.
It doesn't need to be intimidating.

37
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.410
They've got the power of the law to uphold their property rights.

38
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.380
Can now imagine we were to steal a bag of coke,
right?

39
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.120
If we go to the guy near here,
I'm sure there is someone who,
who,
um,
sells coke.

40
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.710
Um,
and he catches us.
He can't call the cops.
Obviously cops would arrest him.

41
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.110
He has to fight us.
Now,
if you're a dealer,

42
00:02:22.111 --> 00:02:24.180
you don't want to be having a fight every day,
right?

43
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.440
You want to establish a reputation for being so frightening that no one would

44
00:02:27.441 --> 00:02:29.130
dare to fuck with you,
right?
So you,

45
00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:31.530
you establish your place in that neighborhood through aggression,

46
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.920
through violence,
and you maintain it through aggression and violence,
right?
Uh,

47
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.620
legal businesses compete on cost and quality of product.
Uh,

48
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.080
in illegal markets.

49
00:02:40.081 --> 00:02:44.400
People compete on how much of a frightening fucker you're prepared to be,
right?

50
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.140
And as a writer called Carlsbad and put it,
um,

51
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.230
the war on drugs creates a wall for drugs,
right?

52
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.840
It transfers it to these criminal gangs who have to operate through violence to

53
00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:57.960
protect their property rights.

54
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.160
So lingos into the drug war thinking I'm the one stopping these gangs.

55
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.610
She realizes she,
I'm the one enabling them,
right?

56
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.610
They control one of the biggest industries in the world because of this police

57
00:03:10.611 --> 00:03:13.780
sanction.
And because of this decision to prohibit these drugs.

58
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.310
And if you want to know how much of this violence is caused by,
by,
um,

59
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.670
by the fact that we prohibited it,
just ask yourself,

60
00:03:21.671 --> 00:03:26.530
where are the violent alcohol dealers?
Right?
Everyone knows who al Capone was.

61
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.940
Does the head of Smirnoff go and shoot the head of Budweiser in the face?
Right?

62
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.090
Does your local bar go and sell a bunch of kids to go and shoot everyone in the

63
00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:38.050
next bar down?
Of course not exactly.
That happened at the alcohol prohibition.

64
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:41.140
When did it end ended on the day alcohol prohibition ended.

65
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.870
Cause legal markets don't compete with that.

66
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.020
So at least partly having this insight,
right?
She's realizing,
Shit,

67
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.450
I think I'm taking down these gangs.
I'm actually empowering them.

68
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.260
What will really disempowered them as reclaiming the market and making it legal,

69
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.470
but she also has another really painful realization.

70
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.800
So early in her career as a cop,
Lee had done this really brief thing.

71
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.850
She'd gone undercover with the clan to expose them.

72
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.520
She'd done a really important work and breaking up parts of the Maryland clam.

73
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.320
She really was not a racist,
right?

74
00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:10.030
She'd had relationships with African American men,

75
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.990
but she knows something that most honest cops notice,

76
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.720
which is the vast majority of people,
the,

77
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.040
they were sent to African American areas to enforce the drug laws.
Right.

78
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:26.230
One of our colleagues,
Matthew fog,
once went to his superior officer and said,

79
00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:28.840
you know,
this is a bit weird,
right?

80
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.870
We only ever seem to go to African American neighborhoods to do all our drug

81
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:35.030
busts.
I'm fairly sure white people sometimes use drug.

82
00:04:35.031 --> 00:04:38.260
Should we go to like a white neighborhood as well?
And the supervisor said,

83
00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:41.650
of course you're right.
White people use drugs,
but white people,

84
00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:44.680
no journalists and lawyers and judges.
That's really,

85
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.980
we just get a whole load of shit for us.
Just go for the low hanging fruit.

86
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.050
So Lee who is not a racist,

87
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.120
could see the effect of what she was doing was in fact racist.
Right.

88
00:04:55.121 --> 00:04:56.530
And she was very uncomfortable with that.

89
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.610
And this really came to a head Billy when leaves police partner was guy called

90
00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:04.450
ed totally.
Who she loved.
Platonically loved.
Um,
yeah,

91
00:05:04.451 --> 00:05:07.360
he was a great champion of women police officers.
It was a great guy.

92
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.170
And one day she gets a call at home.
Ed had been sent on a drug bust.

93
00:05:11.171 --> 00:05:14.860
He was undercover and the guy had thought it was ripping them off and shot him

94
00:05:14.861 --> 00:05:19.840
in the head.
And Lee goes to see eds body and she's like,
what did he die for?

95
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.920
Right?
There are no fewer drug dealers.
Every time we arrest the drug dealer,

96
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.920
the supply of drugs is not disrupted for one hour.

97
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.660
We are enforcing a racist war.
We are empowering these gangs.

98
00:05:31.661 --> 00:05:35.650
Why are we doing this?
So Lee quit as a police officer,

99
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.180
she retrained as a lawyer.

100
00:05:37.181 --> 00:05:40.210
She now gets the criminal records expunged wherever she can have the kind of

101
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:43.180
people that she busted when she was a cop and she's a big,

102
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.450
she was part of a brilliant group called law enforcement against prohibition who

103
00:05:46.451 --> 00:05:49.270
are cops who argue for,
for ending the drug war.

104
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.430
But it's interesting to me because it's hard to be Harry Lee was trying to be

105
00:05:54.431 --> 00:05:58.430
Harry Anslinger is hard to be Harry Anslinger if you're an honest person with a

106
00:05:58.431 --> 00:05:59.570
conscience.
Right?

107
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.260
And there are police officers all over the country who are making these,
these,

108
00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:07.010
these realizations now and that,
you know,

109
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.380
obviously it's very close to my heart what we do to people with addiction

110
00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:16.790
problems.
But I don't,
horrific and catastrophic though.

111
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:17.623
That is,

112
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.050
I don't actually think that's the biggest moral issue around the war on drugs.

113
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.250
The biggest moral issue is the violence created by prohibition.
Right?

114
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.330
If I think about places I've spent time like Columbia,
um,

115
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.570
see that Horez in northern Mexico,
that's the biggest issue,
right?

116
00:06:32.571 --> 00:06:37.130
More people have died in,
in Latin America,
central and South America,

117
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.340
in the drug war,
violence than have died in Syria.

118
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.370
I don't know what we can do about Syria.
We can end this violence.

119
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.500
There's professor at Harvard called Jeffrey Myron [inaudible] trying to be too,

120
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.220
he has a graph of the murder rate in the 20th century in the United States,

121
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.910
massively shoots up the day alcohol is banned and falls like a stone.

122
00:06:55.911 --> 00:06:57.500
The day alcohol is legalized,
right?

123
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.740
And massively rises again when this an intensification of the drug war later.

124
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.070
And we can end a huge amount of this violence,
right?

125
00:07:04.071 --> 00:07:07.250
We can do what Switzerland did,
we can do what?
What's happening here man?

126
00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:11.830
What's stopping us?
So I think the main thing this is,
cause this is a lot

127
00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:16.680
<v 1>go conclusion based on facts and based on cases like Portugal and Switzerland,</v>

128
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.890
there's obviously data.
So people are aware of this.

129
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.830
So people must be confronted with this data.
To this day,

130
00:07:22.831 --> 00:07:26.550
people know that the prohibition on alcohol was a massive disaster and no one

131
00:07:26.551 --> 00:07:30.900
would ever accept it again.
We're slowly starting to realize that marijuana,

132
00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.700
at least for some people is,

133
00:07:32.701 --> 00:07:36.690
is safe and reasonable and should be used recreationally and has some massive

134
00:07:36.691 --> 00:07:37.620
benefits medically.

135
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:43.100
So we're starting to see legalization both for recreational use and,

136
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:47.820
uh,
clearly for medical use spread.
I think,
what did we decide what it was?
It,

137
00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:52.910
I think it's like there's a certain amount of states where it's just fully legal

138
00:07:53.191 --> 00:07:56.790
recreationally and more where it's medical,

139
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.860
but I think it's more than 18 states total.

140
00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:03.180
<v 0>As soon we're going to be half of the American population,
90%.
I mean,</v>

141
00:08:03.181 --> 00:08:04.530
we all is in Canada

142
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:09.270
<v 1>and it should be,
yes it is in Canada as it should be for alcohol.
But what,</v>

143
00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:10.530
what is the stop?

144
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:15.360
What is the wall between this and legalization of all these other drugs and

145
00:08:15.361 --> 00:08:18.770
counseling and implementing some sort of a Switzerland like pro

146
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.970
<v 0>Graham?
I think onto the really important question.
So there's a range of things.</v>

147
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.490
Um,
this is a public perception of big one.

148
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:27.230
I think you've gone to the most important,
right?

149
00:08:27.231 --> 00:08:30.050
So some people say it's the vested financial interest in the existing system.

150
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:34.520
That's true.
If you look at who funds the no campaigns,

151
00:08:34.521 --> 00:08:37.220
whenever they want to legalize marijuana,
you can see the interest,
right?

152
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.830
Prison guard unions,
um,

153
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:43.640
alcohol companies cause they didn't want a commercial competitor.
Um,

154
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:46.820
religious fundamentalist groups like Mormons,
not the all Mormons fundamentalist,

155
00:08:46.821 --> 00:08:50.900
but the groups,
the funding this are,
um,
so it's partly that,

156
00:08:50.901 --> 00:08:53.270
but I think you're right.
I don't think that's the main thing that's going on.

157
00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:55.890
It's,
it's significant and real,
but it's the main thing that's going on.

158
00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:00.360
The main thing,
the main block is
huge.

159
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:04.260
Majorities of Americans more than 80% say the war on drugs has failed and been a

160
00:09:04.261 --> 00:09:08.160
disaster.
And yet most people are afraid of the alternatives.
Right?

161
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.440
And that's pot setting as two things going on.

162
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.080
There's ignorance about what the alternatives actually mean.

163
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.490
So re one of the reasons why chasing the scream is written as I went to all

164
00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:21.240
these places from the killing fields in northern Mexico to Switzerland is

165
00:09:21.241 --> 00:09:25.950
because way too often in this debate,
we talk like we're a philosophy seminar.

166
00:09:25.951 --> 00:09:28.920
People go,
well,
what would legalization mean?
How would it work?

167
00:09:28.921 --> 00:09:32.400
And they go to this weird abstract conversation like,
fuck that.

168
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:33.990
Here's a plane ticket to Geneva.

169
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.170
Here's a plane ticket to Lisbon is a plane ticket to Colorado,
right?

170
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.000
It's not rocket science,
right?

171
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:42.840
I've been to the places that I've tried these things,
we can see the results,

172
00:09:42.841 --> 00:09:43.171
right?

173
00:09:43.171 --> 00:09:46.470
Then they're not legalization is not an APP or decrement and decolonization.

174
00:09:46.471 --> 00:09:50.150
I can explain the difference if you want,
are not abstract,
are the,

175
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.040
what's the key differences between legalization and decriminalization?

176
00:09:53.041 --> 00:09:55.740
Decriminalization is where you stop punishing users,

177
00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.680
but they still have to go to arm criminal gangs to get their drug.

178
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:02.820
Legalization is where you open up some legal route for people to get their
drugs.

179
00:10:02.821 --> 00:10:05.070
And that's varies according to the drug,
right?

180
00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.490
So I guess the kind of headline would be decriminalization shuts down.

181
00:10:08.491 --> 00:10:11.900
Orange is the new black and legalization shuts down breaking bad and Naacos.

182
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.350
Right.
And of course we need to do both.

183
00:10:13.351 --> 00:10:15.950
Threatening to decriminalize use and legalized supplies.
