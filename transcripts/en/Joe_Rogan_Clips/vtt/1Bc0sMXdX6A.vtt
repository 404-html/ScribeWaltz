1
00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.230
I'm dealing with a Georgia.
No,
I live here.
Oh,
okay.
Okay.
Georgia.

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.840
Why just say Georgia?
Somebody told me what you whisper.
Like no one's listening.

3
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.170
Yeah.
Don't tell him.
Why have a secret friendship with Jim Goad.

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.090
Who's one of the few people who makes me really laugh even though you know most

5
00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:20.930
of the secret anymore.
Most of the world that hates Jim Code.

6
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.950
Why do they hate gym goad?
Um,

7
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.520
because he raised these very transgressive in your face pieces,

8
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.520
but when he writes it,
but his brother,

9
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.760
he kills me is some of the most touching stuff I have ever read in my life about

10
00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:39.090
his brother's death.
Um,
so you know,

11
00:00:39.091 --> 00:00:43.320
the whole world I think is so fooled and that they think that Jim go to is a bad

12
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:47.910
person and they think that maybe I'm a good person when it's just exactly the

13
00:00:47.911 --> 00:00:52.560
opposite.
How are you a bad person?
Oh,

14
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:54.120
let's not even go down that road.

15
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.470
I already told on Cheryl strayed killing that bird.
Come on.
Do I got to do more?

16
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.210
That's not being a bad person.

17
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.290
That's a person who is appreciative of a dark moment that doesn't make you a bad

18
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:08.940
person.
No,
I'm a bad person.

19
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.930
Are you really?
Give me an example.

20
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.780
You know,
and this is awkward,
but this is another one of those cognitive

21
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.080
reframing honesty things,

22
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.910
is I took care of my mother while she was dying of lung cancer.

23
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.560
And even while I was taking care of her and she was lapsing in and out of

24
00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:33.090
consciousness in her home,

25
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.530
there was a little part of me that felt this glee that thought

26
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.730
I will never have to worry about mom again.
Uh,

27
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.090
I will never have to worry about whether mom is offended by my work.

28
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.350
I will never have to worry about mom falling down the stairs and breaking her

29
00:01:50.351 --> 00:01:55.270
leg.
That this enormous concern in my life will be resolved.

30
00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.973
<v 1>Uh,</v>

31
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.300
<v 0>it's going to be at the cost of losing someone I love,
you know,
so much.</v>

32
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.590
But the benefit is that this huge burden of responsibility is going to be

33
00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:14.060
lifted.
And so there was this kind of secret glee thinking,
you know,
I'm going to,

34
00:02:14.061 --> 00:02:17.180
I'm going to have some freedom here that I never imagined.

35
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.053
<v 1>MMM.</v>

36
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.060
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

37
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.470
Nora Ephron touches on that in her work when she talks about her mother's death,

38
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.610
and I think it's just a,
it's an,
it's an honest thing,

39
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.520
but it's not a thing that makes you look very good.

40
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.940
I don't think that makes you a bad person.

41
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.800
I think that that makes you a person who's honest about thoughts that are very

42
00:02:39.801 --> 00:02:40.634
uncomfortable,

43
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.710
that that is just something that people think,
I think all the time,

44
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.950
if they're dealing with someone who's completely incapacitated and they have to

45
00:02:49.951 --> 00:02:53.850
care for them 24 seven but they don't express it,

46
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.883
it's just,

47
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.130
<v 2>it's just that a reality of the burden of someone who's really sick or really</v>

48
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.490
dying is it?
There's,
there's no getting around it.
I don't think it's about,

49
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.440
that's a not a good example on need to,

50
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:13.510
I need an example of why you are a bad person.

51
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.720
Maybe you just really self critical and aware of things that other people could

52
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.330
take out of context of the,
the,
the totality of your life.

53
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.130
And just use it as an example.
Put it in quotes and using it as an example

54
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.940
<v 0>of you being a bad person.
You know,
another thing is I really,</v>

55
00:03:31.941 --> 00:03:36.260
really conflicted about the nature of my,
uh,
creativity.

56
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.450
This idea that in journalism school they call the theory seduce and betray,

57
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.700
that when you go into an interview situation,

58
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.670
your goal is to gain the trust of that person and to get them to reveal

59
00:03:49.671 --> 00:03:54.560
something very intimate that you're going to betray by revealing to the public.

60
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.270
So you're just basically going in there to,

61
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.560
to charm them and then to hurt them.
And,
uh,

62
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.410
and so much of my creative process is that way because,
uh,
for example,

63
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.030
the guts story [inaudible] the,
the,

64
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.490
the story in which the guy puts the carrot up his blood,

65
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.180
that was my best friend at the time in like late twenties,

66
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.540
and he got fantastically drunk.
And he told me that carrot story.

67
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.970
And I honestly believe he had never told anybody the carrot story.

68
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.110
And I,
I kept that story in my mind for you know,
10,

69
00:04:36.111 --> 00:04:41.111
15 almost probably 20 years until I found a way to put it with three similar

70
00:04:41.241 --> 00:04:43.370
stories and make a larger piece out of it.

71
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.910
And the first time I read that story,

72
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.520
I hadn't seen him in maybe a couple of years.

73
00:04:49.521 --> 00:04:54.521
This friend and I look across this big auditorium and there he is and I'm

74
00:04:55.611 --> 00:05:00.611
telling his carrot story in front of hundreds and hundreds of people and the

75
00:05:00.891 --> 00:05:02.840
look on his face,
he's just stricken

76
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.130
and he hasn't talked to me since.

77
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.480
<v 2>This is why even even David,</v>

78
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.140
he uses name no then fuck him.
No,
but what's wrong with them?

79
00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.500
People still feel betrayed and get over it.

80
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.460
You need to hang out with more comedians.
Infuse a comic.
You'd be laughing.
Well,

81
00:05:25.461 --> 00:05:27.680
you know,
David [inaudible] has told me,

82
00:05:27.681 --> 00:05:31.790
he said his family is very reluctant to share their lives with them anymore

83
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.710
because he's kind of made them involuntary public figures and they have to deal

84
00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:39.260
with the fallout from these stories about them.

85
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.180
And really only his brother and his sister Amy have kind of been able to spin

86
00:05:44.181 --> 00:05:48.980
this in a good way,
but it alienates a lot of people.
Oh,
for sure.

87
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.221
Well,

88
00:05:49.221 --> 00:05:53.690
especially if you use their actual name or people know the origin of the actual

89
00:05:53.691 --> 00:05:58.040
story.
Yeah,
yeah.
But that's,
you're not a bad,
sorry,

90
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.450
sorry to break it to you think you're a bad person.
Those are the only examples.

91
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.630
<v 0>You're not convinced.
No,
no.
I'm just not revealing the worst stuff.
Yeah,</v>

92
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.513
of course.

93
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:18.070
<v 2>Think that you have to have some sort of embracing of these dark thoughts to</v>

94
00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:22.210
create the way you create.
I mean,

95
00:06:22.211 --> 00:06:27.211
you're creating these characters that go down some horrible roads,

96
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.370
both mentally and in reality in,
in your work and it's amazing stuff.

97
00:06:33.371 --> 00:06:35.590
But to cultivate that,
don't you think?

98
00:06:35.591 --> 00:06:39.040
You have to be kind of in touch with those thoughts of your own to kind of in

99
00:06:39.041 --> 00:06:42.790
touch with this,
you know,

100
00:06:42.791 --> 00:06:45.250
this thing where you're watching your mom dying you,

101
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.420
you are going to be relieved of a burden and you don't want to tell anybody
that.

102
00:06:49.421 --> 00:06:52.330
You're kind of looking forward to that a little bit.

103
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.800
Even though you love your mom dearly,
this,

104
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.290
that's a natural thing that people don't want to discuss,

105
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.580
but absolutely exists.
It's the elephant in the room.

106
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:05.620
<v 0>And,
and that's kind of like,
yeah,</v>

107
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.350
how comedy works or anything where you're stating this unstated thing.

108
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:15.240
You're creating this enormous relief.
Uh,
uh,

109
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:19.710
my classic example when I teach,
I asked my students,
I say,
so,

110
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.620
so what do you call a black man that flies a plane,

111
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.130
a pilot?
You fucking racist.

112
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.420
You're creating this tension,
right?
Hey,

113
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.250
don't want you to say what they think you're going to say.

114
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.490
They don't want to hate you.
They like you,
right?

115
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.960
And they don't want you to say something hateful and awful.
Yeah.

116
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.980
And then you turn it around,
he put it on them.
Um,
and so

117
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:49.210
<v 1>yeah,</v>

118
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:52.960
<v 0>in a way,
you know,
I always think that's the soul of comedy is to create this,</v>

119
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:56.620
this tension that you relieve as quickly as possible.

120
00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.170
And the relief occurs as laughter.

121
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:05.360
<v 2>I was having dinner with a good friend of mine,
his wife,
and a buddy of mine,</v>

122
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.840
and my friend's friend and his wife and fun time,

123
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:16.760
the whole night.
Everybody's laughing and joking and,
or have a dinner.
And,

124
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.990
uh,
having a couple of drinks and joking around talking about things.

125
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.633
And

126
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:27.950
I forget what led to him saying this,

127
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:32.660
but we were talking about,
oh,

128
00:08:32.661 --> 00:08:36.080
just unfortunate scenarios and you know,

129
00:08:36.081 --> 00:08:40.940
people that their life is not going the way they'd like it to go.

130
00:08:40.941 --> 00:08:43.970
And things going back and out of nowhere the guy goes,
well,

131
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.393
that's like this.

132
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:52.510
<v 0>My daughter has a,
she had a baby with a black man</v>

133
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:56.160
<v 2>and we're,
we're both</v>

134
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.360
<v 0>like looking at him like,
where's this going?
And then he goes and uh,
you know,</v>

135
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:04.320
I just think it's incredibly selfish to bring that kid into the world.

136
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.540
And this kid doesn't have an identity.

137
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:10.650
They're not black and the not white and they don't,
they're,

138
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:11.970
they're not going to have an identity.

139
00:09:11.971 --> 00:09:15.930
They're not going to have a group to belong to.
And my friends,

140
00:09:15.931 --> 00:09:17.370
jaws dropped my,

141
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:21.450
I didn't know the guy just spent on that night and my drop and I looked at my

142
00:09:21.451 --> 00:09:24.320
other friend who's with me who didn't know any of these other people.

143
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.340
And everyone's like,
what the fuck?

144
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.440
And then a couple of us get up and go to the bathroom and I turned to my friend

145
00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:33.060
Andrew and I said,
let's get the fuck outta here.

146
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.220
And we just laughed and I texted my friend,
I go,

147
00:09:35.221 --> 00:09:39.360
too much racism had it go and we just left.
And uh,

148
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:44.010
but it was so weird.
It's like this guy was holding into this and he's like,

149
00:09:44.011 --> 00:09:46.290
you know what?
I can trust these people.
It's some racist shit.

150
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.680
I can trust them and it didn't work.
And he knew it didn't work.

151
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:55.290
He knew it went over the world like a lead balloon.
He knew it.

152
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:59.310
He could feel it cause everybody was like,
what?
Like wait a minute,

153
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:04.050
your daughter's in love with a man who's black.
They have a child together.

154
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.320
And you think it's incredibly selfish to bring that kid in the world.

155
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:09.600
Like what the fuck?

156
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:13.410
I wish I could remember what the fuck we were talking about before then.

157
00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:15.900
But what we're talking about before then,

158
00:10:15.901 --> 00:10:18.840
it was like drug addicts or people fuck up or you know,

159
00:10:18.841 --> 00:10:21.110
people were dictated to gambling or something.
You know,

160
00:10:21.111 --> 00:10:25.650
people whose lives are in chaos.
And then he brings up his daughter.

161
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:27.180
Having a baby with a,

162
00:10:27.181 --> 00:10:32.130
a guy was the wrong amount of melanin skin whose ancestors came from the wrong

163
00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:36.600
part of the world for him.
It was weird,
man.
It was,
we,

164
00:10:36.601 --> 00:10:39.930
it was weird also to see him recognize.

165
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:45.640
I did funny,
you know,
you throw out a story,
I throw out a story.
Uh,

166
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:50.520
I had a hired car from Philadelphia to New York once on,
on tour.
And,
uh,

167
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:54.170
as we were going past liberty hall in Philadelphia,
this,

168
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.890
this great guy with a Philly accent driving the car,

169
00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:01.420
he points at Liberty Hall and he says,
that building has stood for,
you know,

170
00:11:01.421 --> 00:11:04.000
300 years.
I bet you can't tell me why.

171
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:08.220
And I just looked and I said,

172
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:10.920
because the bricks are laid in Flemish bond.

173
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.660
I think that's probably it with a brick.

174
00:11:14.661 --> 00:11:17.480
Bricks are offset in such a way that they bond in the center.

175
00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.420
It's called Flemish bond.
And it guys

176
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.570
so silent,
nobody's ever answered the question.

177
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:29.340
And his father was a bricklayer and he was so proud.
And he goes,
you're right.

178
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:32.850
Nobody's ever said Flemish bond.

179
00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.460
That's why it's still stands.

180
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:40.930
And we were best friends and just talking like crazy all the way into Manhattan.

181
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:46.560
We get into Manhattan and these two guys walking down the street,
the Guy Goes,

182
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:51.060
oh Christ,
I hate coming to New York.
Uh,
the facts

183
00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:54.130
and said,
well,
you know,

184
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:58.630
I'm married to a man and Faggot has pretty much my middle name

185
00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:02.980
now.
Poor guy.

186
00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:08.240
He had to do this since re juggling of everything that the guy who knew Flemish

187
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.360
bond was also one of them.
Oh,

188
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:16.790
<v 2>oh.</v>

189
00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:21.890
<v 0>And it was one of those wonderful kind of icky but unnecessary moments.</v>

190
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.910
And I know they're horrible,
but you know,

191
00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.050
things are better afterwards.
She must've loved that moment though,

192
00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:32.401
you know,

193
00:12:32.401 --> 00:12:35.670
it was a horrible moment because I felt like I was throwing away any kind of

194
00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:39.510
chatty conversational relationship I had with this guy.

195
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:42.600
He seemed like just the salt of the earth.
Great Funny Guy.

196
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:47.280
And it was just kind of going out on a limb and saying,
okay,
you know,

197
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:48.930
he's going to hate my guts after this.

198
00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.550
<v 2>Oh,
when I was a little kid,</v>

199
00:12:52.551 --> 00:12:57.110
we lived in San Francisco from age seven to 11,
and then moved to Florida,

200
00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.700
which is the polar opposite of San Francisco.
And uh,

201
00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:03.800
uh,
I,
I really,

202
00:13:03.801 --> 00:13:07.850
I don't know if I'd ever heard someone use the word faggot before,

203
00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:12.290
but I'd never seen a,
an adult upset about gay people before.
And then,
um,

204
00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.250
my friend Candy Candido was his name.

205
00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.370
His Dad was Cuban.
They were Cuban.
And uh,

206
00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:24.280
his dad slams a newspaper on the,
on the table.
I was 11.
And he's like,

207
00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:29.000
can't believe they're letting these fags getting married.
He was just so angry.

208
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:33.920
And I remember stopping and thinking like,
here,
here's a,
uh,
man,

209
00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:38.780
this guy's a man.
He's a grown man.
He's a grown up,
but yet he's,

210
00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:44.680
he's got this infant idea of what a person should be like.

211
00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:47.180
They got to fall into this category,
that category.

212
00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.430
He's got it locked into his head.
He's a fucking baby,

213
00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.990
but he's a man and he's my friend's Dad.
This guy sucks.

214
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.610
This guy made it to 35 years old or whatever the fuck he was.
And this is his,

215
00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:02.630
this is his operating system that he's using to navigate its way through life.

216
00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:07.940
I remembered it being an important moment for me because I realize like just

217
00:14:07.941 --> 00:14:12.170
because someone is older doesn't mean they learned anything.
Mm.
You know,

218
00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:15.590
and that people are capable of success in life.
You know,

219
00:14:15.591 --> 00:14:19.250
you could become married,
you can have children,
you get a house,
you get good job,

220
00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:23.140
you drive a car,
the hold that you got it all.
If you've got a checkbook,

221
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:26.240
you gotta fucking you.
You're,
you're,
you're operating,
it's moving,

222
00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:31.140
you're successful,
it's happening.
And yet you still have these sticks.

223
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.500
<v 0>It is,
I mean,
I'm,</v>

224
00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:37.290
but I think that there's a benefit to the expression of the stupid idea.

225
00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.080
Not that they can never be challenged,

226
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:44.910
but that at least when we're aware that it's there.
Yeah.
And that,
you know,

227
00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:49.260
we know that this thing is not just kind of festering and that there's a way of

228
00:14:49.261 --> 00:14:53.900
kind of,
not fixing person,
but at least we know where they're coming from.

229
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.570
Yeah.
I know.
Oh,

230
00:14:56.571 --> 00:15:00.140
another shooting myself in the career foot thing.

231
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.800
I don't think you've done it once.
The whole show.
Okay.
Here it goes.

232
00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:10.150
<v 2>I read the daily stormer.</v>

233
00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:17.290
Andrew Anglin cracks me up.
Who is that?

234
00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:21.070
He is the completely transgressive guy

235
00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.840
<v 0>who really loves fight club.
Oh Wow.
Writes for the daily stormer.</v>

236
00:15:26.841 --> 00:15:31.790
I think he is the daily stormer and he writes the most atrocious,

237
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:36.290
insensitive,
uh,
brutal things,

238
00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:42.220
but they are there so shocking and so transgressive that,

239
00:15:43.761 --> 00:15:48.080
uh,
that sometimes I laugh just out of the shock,
you know,

240
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.800
uh,
the old classic joke,
how do you get a nun pregnant?

241
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:56.720
You fuck her?
You know,
there's a shock value there that,

242
00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:01.310
that just sort of jars me.
It makes me laugh sometimes

243
00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:05.070
<v 2>that joker to work better.
If you hadn't told the black pilot choke first.</v>

244
00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:08.250
Well of course the problem is like people become,
uh,
you know,

245
00:16:08.251 --> 00:16:09.540
you know what's coming.

246
00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.790
<v 0>Yeah.
But,
uh,</v>

247
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:18.110
but sometimes I want to go into a world where people are not watching their

248
00:16:19.591 --> 00:16:21.640
language so closely and,

249
00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:26.520
and I see people kind of a vent,
the worst of themselves.

250
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.640
Right.
And I'm not kind of endorsing it,

251
00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:35.420
but I feel a little less reactive to abuse.

252
00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:40.380
A scientologist has having this exercise called bull baiting where they take you

253
00:16:40.381 --> 00:16:44.820
into a room and people surround you and they call you every horrible thing.

254
00:16:44.821 --> 00:16:45.480
And then they,

255
00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:49.770
they nitpick horror every aspect of your appearance or your character,

256
00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:54.930
who you are.
And they attack you on every level.
And they do this for long,

257
00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:55.860
long periods of time.

258
00:16:55.861 --> 00:17:00.600
And they do this day after day until you are completely not reactionary to that

259
00:17:00.601 --> 00:17:04.770
kind of verbal abuse.
You can,
you can put it over there,

260
00:17:04.771 --> 00:17:07.980
you can accept the fact that it's somebody else's statement,

261
00:17:07.981 --> 00:17:10.140
somebody else's opinion,
observation,

262
00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:14.670
that it's not true and you can be with it.
And so in a way,

263
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
when I go into these sites that are so patently offensive and in a deliberately,

264
00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:23.940
you know,
aggressively offensive,

265
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:28.920
I feel like in a way they're thickening my skin that,
uh,

266
00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:34.140
I'm not quite a such a delicate little reactive thing afterwards.

267
00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:36.810
Do you worry about someone looking through your search results?

268
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.410
<v 2>Things that last.</v>
