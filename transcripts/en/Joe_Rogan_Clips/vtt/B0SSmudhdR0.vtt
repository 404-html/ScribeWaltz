1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.020
Have a president who really is from the people who says,
uh,

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.920
he looks at like,
you know,
here's eight folders of stuff to read.
And like,

3
00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:12.000
I don't think so.
Give me the cliff notes.
Like I'll play it from the hip.
Like,

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.690
no,
I'm going to watch Fox and friends.
You tell me what I needed to know.

5
00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:16.411
And you know,

6
00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:19.950
it's not for me to sit and rip on the guy because he's not here to defend

7
00:00:19.951 --> 00:00:20.431
himself,

8
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:24.900
but never in my life have I ever watched an American president thought to
myself,

9
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.410
I could have done better in that situation.
And there's presidents,

10
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.900
I've had nothing but disagree with,

11
00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:33.990
but they were way better for the job than I ever could be.

12
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.600
I look at this guy and I'm like,
man,

13
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:40.690
you just got played and there's something,

14
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.690
when I knew I was going to be talking to you,

15
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.870
there's a thing I was thinking about.
Um,
cause I,
I saw,

16
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.870
I heard you speak many years ago about these politicians are gangster.

17
00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:52.704
He said like,
okay,

18
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.910
what that guy did that's Gangsta and what this guy just did straight up

19
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.610
gangsters during the Bush administration.
You are just,

20
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.890
I think it was like Halliburton,
all these people,

21
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.930
the Cheney world and you're like,
that's a gangster movie.

22
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.040
That's a gangster movie.
I'm like,
I can't disagree with anything he just said.

23
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.530
And on that kind of level,

24
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.040
I think what I never hear is that Donald Trump is a guy who gets consistently

25
00:01:17.341 --> 00:01:21.090
played,
rolled,
got rolled by his wife,

26
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.890
who a woman I have nothing against,

27
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.700
but she comes from a really tough part of the world.
Slovenia,

28
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.710
that's just a rough patch or real estate.

29
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.550
She's smart and she's tough and she got out,
got to America,

30
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
well he's not much on looks but it's a way in from the storm.

31
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.750
So he got played by his wife.
He got played by Paul Manafort.

32
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.360
He got played by Kim Jong Un.

33
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.900
He got played like Jimi Hendrix at Monterey that that particular stratocaster by

34
00:01:53.821 --> 00:01:58.821
Vladimir Putin and gets played like rock modern off every single day and anyone

35
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.110
he does high stakes business with or renegotiations he gets played,

36
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.910
played and,
and Manafort just used him to try and,
you know,

37
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.070
get out of debt and all these other people,

38
00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:16.410
they just roll all over him.

39
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.030
And unfortunately his Hubris is such,
he's like ha ha,

40
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.110
like no dude,

41
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.110
you just got blown out and like everyone around you is playing you.

42
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.330
Well he probably doesn't feel that way with Manafort because Manafort's on trial

43
00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:32.070
and he's not yet right,

44
00:02:32.071 --> 00:02:36.660
but Manafort played him cause Manafort really does play in that world of

45
00:02:36.661 --> 00:02:41.340
oligarchs and millions of dollars in laundering money.
If he wrote a book,

46
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.710
I was telling someone the other day as I have all these people,

47
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.210
he should write the book because it would be a page Turner if he told the truth

48
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.060
would get him killed.
He touched the wrong door knob and he gets poisoned.

49
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.910
Cause like Simon Putin can't have him telling what he knows.
He's a man.

50
00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.480
He probably will go to prison,
watch him have some kind of strange accident.

51
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.860
He was liquefied in the shower.

52
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.840
Something about the water because he knows a lot and there's a lot of people who

53
00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:14.050
can pay a lot of money to keep his mouth shut.
Yeah.
Well,

54
00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:17.470
you know what's fascinating to me is that over the last year or two,

55
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:22.360
especially from the Fox crew,
you're seeing Vladimir Putin admired.

56
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.370
Yup.
It's very strange.
I never thought we would see that.
I was watching,

57
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.503
uh,

58
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.940
something a couple of years ago at a year ago and I was like,
some guy,
well,

59
00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:36.580
he's a good Christian man and he believes in family.
I'm like,

60
00:03:36.581 --> 00:03:39.360
he's the butcher of Chechnya.
Yeah.

61
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.710
Let's flash back to the 1960s.

62
00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:46.270
I'm a young boy on the weekend visit with my father to the right of my father is

63
00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:50.410
a wall.
There's nothing to the right of my father,
just nothing.
And um,

64
00:03:50.411 --> 00:03:54.220
if he's still with us,
he'd be in his nineties and hard as a rock,

65
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.300
just like nothing.
He's like a bar of Hickory.

66
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.810
Anyway.
Um,
he's an economist.
He's a numbers guy and a phd,
rural,

67
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.140
smart.
I'm coming home to my mom's apartment from the Saturday,

68
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:12.040
Sunday visit with dad.
We're in Washington DC area.

69
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.250
I'm a little boy,
five years old,
somewhere around there.

70
00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:18.610
Very small economist and Communist.

71
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.930
I don't know what either of them are arguably to a five year old kind of sounds

72
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:26.980
the same.
I'm in the big Buick station wagon,
um,

73
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.190
to my father's right.
We're pulling up to mom's apartment.

74
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.030
Henry Dad,
are you a communist?

75
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.410
I don't think my father's facial expression changed.

76
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.980
His right hand came off the wheel and his backhand collided with my head.

77
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.533
It was just like,

78
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.280
I hear the word common is a boy gets smacked and it was without hatred or

79
00:04:51.281 --> 00:04:55.300
violence.
It was like national security,
like whack.

80
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.120
He didn't even know he did it.
He was like a sneeze,

81
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.970
like Kapow and it hurts so much.

82
00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:05.380
My head went numb and it was not even the pain.

83
00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:07.880
It was like the shock of uh,

84
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.870
your dad whacking you with,

85
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.020
you had no idea what you did and all I could do,

86
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.950
it was hyper ventilate and he opened the door and he let me out.

87
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.390
He didn't say a word,

88
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.210
he didn't tell you that there's a difference between a communist and an

89
00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:26.710
economist.
So I left the call like for like till I was like 33,

90
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.720
you know what I mean?
Cause it's so destabilizing.

91
00:05:31.721 --> 00:05:35.770
Like your dad just walloped you and I get out of the elevator,

92
00:05:35.771 --> 00:05:40.390
I go into the apartment,
the smoke.
But I did that till I was like,
you know,

93
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.430
till two years ago.
It was totally,
she said,
honey,
what happened?
I said,

94
00:05:45.431 --> 00:05:50.140
I asked dad if he was a comic.
She's like,
okay,
well the point I'm making is this.

95
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.970
There's a bunch of people who voted for Trump.
Were you say Russia?

96
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.340
They say bunch of sons of bitches.

97
00:05:58.341 --> 00:06:01.670
Trust him as far as you can throw your car.
Are you kidding?

98
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.530
And when I see staunch conservative Republicans going,
well,
that boot and guy,

99
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:07.364
I'm like,

100
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.110
are you kidding people like my dad's heads are exploding.

101
00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:15.710
He's an old Cold War Guy.
We would wash,
uh,

102
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.120
Boris and Natasha,
whatever that cartoon was as,
yeah,
as a kid,

103
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.470
I'm laughing cause the guy with,
ah,

104
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.480
my dad's laughing on a whole other level because it's Cold War funnies.

105
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.230
It's was written for the parents.
The kids get the cartoon,

106
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.850
the parents got the jokes that that was for adults Wa with their kids on

107
00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:39.020
Saturday.
You watch them later on,
you're like,
oh,
this is cold war humor.

108
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.100
I wouldn't have known,
but that's my dad's world.
You say Russia,

109
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.270
he probably hated my guts because I've been there six times for shows and to

110
00:06:47.271 --> 00:06:48.800
take the Trans Siberian express.

111
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:54.340
And so this warming up to a guy who is a true bad guy,

112
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.420
he's scary.
There's bodies buried because of him.

113
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.280
He's one of the scariest guys on the planet.

114
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.250
[inaudible] and capably violent and we'll have you taken out,

115
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.090
I mean like Anna Politkovskaya,
one of the greatest journalists of our time.

116
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.260
She was critical of Putin and she got assassinated in her apartment building.

117
00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:16.130
Her books are great.
Her books from Chechnya are amazing.
And like he was,

118
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.260
she was critical of him and she had to go.

119
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.420
And when you see our president cozying up to this guy,
I just want to go,
Bro,

120
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.140
let's talk play.
Let's take a walk in the garden for 20 minutes.

121
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.000
You can't be friends with this guy.
My theory is there,
there,
there's,

122
00:07:32.001 --> 00:07:35.150
there's some kind of finances where he's,
he's got a stick up for him.

123
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.600
I don't think it's a tape of people urinating on anyone.

124
00:07:38.601 --> 00:07:43.370
I think it's his money too cliche to interesting.
Um,
it,
it,
it's,
it's a,

125
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.790
it's a money thing.
It's a hotel deal.
It's money sitting in Cypress.

126
00:07:46.791 --> 00:07:50.480
It's something.
But the fact that we're being,

127
00:07:50.481 --> 00:07:52.970
becoming okay with this guy,

128
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:59.020
that is the part that bugs me the most and why people in Congress or collect

129
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.860
Sean Hannity who like probably likes Communists as much as my dad,

130
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:08.300
even me.
I don't trust people like that at all.

131
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:12.770
Putin is a criminal,
should be in jail for a million,
billion years.

132
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:18.230
And the fact that gay,
he's,
uh,
like when,
when he's a strong leader,
he,
he,
he's a,

133
00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:23.210
he's a human being.
We can talk like,
gosh,
he's like x Kgb guy who,

134
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:27.270
and there's no such thing as an ex KGB guy,
right?
Yeah.
They're KGB for life,

135
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:31.310
for life.
And he's a supreme operative.
And what he does is he,

136
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:35.330
he rolls people like you dude,
and like cut you are a guppy.

137
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:39.170
He's a shark.
Like no two guys hanging out.

138
00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:42.110
No one guy getting played in one guy playing someone.

139
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:45.590
I think he admires the fact that Putin is able to run his country the way he

140
00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:50.110
does too.
Yes.
And that's why he looks Duterte and [inaudible] and I've been to,

141
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:54.260
we said about,
Ooh,
and he said he's a strong head and I,
those countries,

142
00:08:54.261 --> 00:08:56.160
I've been to the Philippines,
I've been to North Korea.

143
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.600
They're tough places to live and like you don't want your country looking like

144
00:09:00.601 --> 00:09:04.740
those places.
You don't want America to be like Russia.
It,

145
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:08.880
the economy's destroyed and there's a lot of people like in the wintertime it's

146
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:12.690
really tough.
How do you think the seniors homeless thing?
He goes to jail?
No,

147
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:18.300
no.
Uh,
because I don't believe in Karma.
Karma.

148
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.900
Here's my two words that disprove Karma.
Dick Cheney,

149
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.160
he's got a new heart and a new heart.
He has no pulse,
which is perfectly,

150
00:09:26.161 --> 00:09:28.830
he's got a pulse now with the new heart.
Okay.
Cause the machine,
yeah.

151
00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:33.240
Knew Paul Sheen,
he just heard a wish,
which is perfect for him.

152
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:34.583
But a Bible,

153
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:37.560
he may very well live cause he looked like he's watching his weight now.

154
00:09:37.561 --> 00:09:42.090
He's like look and lean.
He might live to be like 105.
Um,

155
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.110
and so he'll never go to jail and,

156
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.130
and like how many millions does he make a year?
Just from his dividends,

157
00:09:47.131 --> 00:09:49.860
from whatever.
Like who knows what you do with that kind of money?

158
00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:53.490
I don't know what you do with it.
And so I don't think he goes to jail.

159
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.760
I don't think Jared Cushner goes to jail.
I think it most,

160
00:09:56.761 --> 00:10:00.690
they leave like maybe next year and they go like,
I drained the swamp.

161
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:05.070
I did what I came here to do and the fake news media brought me down and all his

162
00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:08.880
people buy one of everything.
He makes forever steak vodka.

163
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.340
I think it's possible that Donald Trump jr goes to jail.

164
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.790
It's very possible they're talking about perjury charges against him now because

165
00:10:14.791 --> 00:10:18.950
his own dad admitted on Twitter.
Yes.
Yeah,
no,
I follow all that stuff.
As you know,

166
00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:22.860
I just don't think white collar guys go to prison for stuff.

167
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.580
I just don't believe it.
You know,
I just don't believe it.

168
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:30.270
I want to be proven wrong,
but I don't have all the facts.
I'm a,

169
00:10:30.271 --> 00:10:31.860
I'm a news watcher.
I know nothing.

170
00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:36.440
I don't get any classified briefs so I only know what I read and what I hear.

171
00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:39.240
Talking about any of this stuff and your stay jacked a little bit,

172
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:40.920
but knowing my audience,

173
00:10:40.921 --> 00:10:45.921
they're very sharp and they read the readers and they don't need me repeating

174
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:51.030
what they know that to them.
And so,
well good for you for that.
If I make a point,

175
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:52.980
as my dad used to say,

176
00:10:52.981 --> 00:10:56.850
you want to score hidden where they ain't the baseball idea.

177
00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:00.790
And so if I can make a point,
like if I was on stage tonight,

178
00:11:00.791 --> 00:11:01.680
I talking about Trump,

179
00:11:01.681 --> 00:11:06.120
I would roll out that idea of Trump is a guy who has been played by so many

180
00:11:06.121 --> 00:11:09.000
people around him and no one talks about his wife playing him.

181
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.810
Like there's no love in that marriage.
I don't think she saw a way out,

182
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.140
came to New York and went,
that guy,
yeah,

183
00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.510
gets naked with the toad a few nights a month,

184
00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.450
handful of a handful of Prozac,

185
00:11:21.451 --> 00:11:25.650
some Stoli and a credit card and a seven figure expense account.

186
00:11:25.651 --> 00:11:30.030
You can take a shower and make it go away.
Um,

187
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:35.070
so I,
I think he,
and I think he kind of knows that,
you know,
she was not like,
wow,

188
00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.890
what a hot guy.
She's like,
Hey,
and there's,
you know,

189
00:11:37.891 --> 00:11:41.790
that happens a lot in this town.
You'll see that yield the couple,

190
00:11:41.791 --> 00:11:46.740
and you're like,
okay.
Yeah,
right.
Well,
Harvey Weinstein before his,

191
00:11:46.741 --> 00:11:50.880
uh,
for his wife left him Harvey Weinstein's wife was beautiful.

192
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.730
Well,
yeah,
but you see that a lot in this town where you see the,

193
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.740
the old weird dude with like the,
the eight year old girlfriend,
you're like,

194
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:03.280
oh yeah,
that's a,
that's a setup.
That's an agency.
That's an agreement.

195
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.960
That's someone's getting a salary or an implied,
you know,
it's,
it's uh,

196
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.690
there's some kind of quid pro quo.
There's a credit card,

197
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:15.190
there's an expense account or there's just like a big fist full of hundreds and

198
00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:20.191
just let me chew on you for the next four weeks or whatever the agreement is.

199
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:21.893
And,
and I,

200
00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:26.350
so if I was going to say anything about Donald Trump on stage would be who soaks

201
00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:30.730
and I,
I never talk about any problem onstage.
And I learned this from,

202
00:12:30.731 --> 00:12:32.680
of all people,
President Clinton,

203
00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.520
because some of his later speeches post-presidency I'm not a huge fan of the
guy,

204
00:12:36.521 --> 00:12:37.960
but he's a good speaker.

205
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:42.400
And he did some speeches in the UK a few years ago and I happened to be in

206
00:12:42.401 --> 00:12:45.880
England when he was there and I watched him on TV.
The last part of this huge,

207
00:12:45.881 --> 00:12:48.370
the last 10 minutes was,
here's a problem and here's three solutions.

208
00:12:48.371 --> 00:12:52.300
Here's another problem.
Here's three solutions.
We're like for for $60 million.

209
00:12:52.301 --> 00:12:56.260
We could put Internet through this thing or we could open this waterway or we

210
00:12:56.261 --> 00:13:00.850
could reconfigure this workforce to upgrade so everyone can get a paycheck.

211
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.280
He just had logical ways forward.

212
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:07.660
So what I took from that is to my audience,
don't propose a problem.

213
00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:09.220
Well he sucks.
Thanks.
Good night.

214
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:13.180
Don't give them a Gordian knot unless you can go.
Actually,

215
00:13:13.181 --> 00:13:17.200
it's not a Gordian knot.
Here's three ways to get out of this burning wreck.

216
00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:21.910
And so like when,
when Trump became elected,
it was,
I was on tour,

217
00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.790
I was doing a bunch of nights in La and I said,
okay,

218
00:13:24.791 --> 00:13:28.090
you have a new president and some of you are depressed.
I said,
I know.

219
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:33.280
And so gay people are on the endangered species list is as if they've never
been.

220
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:38.170
Um,
Brown people,
black people,
women,
people,
people with ovaries.

221
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:41.800
These were all on the you're screwed list.

222
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:46.600
So instead of being coming depressed and oh no,
let's we get up,

223
00:13:46.601 --> 00:13:51.400
we started doing more benefits.
Now all your words matter.
Your actions matter.

224
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:55.270
How you stick up for your LGBT friends really matters.
Now,

225
00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:00.430
how you stick up for women,
how you stick up for racial equality,

226
00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.100
equality in the workplace,
like a,

227
00:14:03.101 --> 00:14:07.390
how you check yourself when you really do with other people.
Words matter.

228
00:14:07.391 --> 00:14:10.240
Actions matter more than ever.
And so to me,

229
00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:14.950
it's an exciting time to show how great you can be because now it's all on the

230
00:14:14.951 --> 00:14:19.810
line.
The fat is off the land.
We're being tested.
I love a test.

231
00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:24.220
So let's get it on.
It's like a in your line of work when the guy goes,

232
00:14:24.221 --> 00:14:29.020
here we go.
That's how I saw it.
Like,
okay,
let's read.

233
00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.860
Let's get the Monday to the ACL.
Aclu.
Let's get some money to planned parenthood.

234
00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:36.880
Let's get a conversation going about a child suicide,

235
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.500
intimidation through Facebook.

236
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:41.980
Let's start making things better because this guy is not our ally.

237
00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:46.780
Governments not necessarily going to help at its best.

238
00:14:46.781 --> 00:14:50.050
It's inactive at its worst.
It's divisive and predatory.

239
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:54.530
So let's be the antidote by being cool.
Bye.

240
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:58.130
You're not throwing rocks through windows or like getting it out of the Tiki

241
00:14:58.131 --> 00:15:00.660
torch and beating him up.
C'Mon,
um,

242
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:03.530
you're never going to convince that guy that he's wrong.

243
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.790
So get to the people you agree with and let's start sticking together more and

244
00:15:07.791 --> 00:15:10.820
raising more money and get some more interesting people in office.

245
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.360
And let's get some young people in office.
And I think that's what's happening.

246
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:18.740
Like you're seeing all these young people like twenties thirties,
sadly,

247
00:15:18.741 --> 00:15:20.990
there's a bunch of kids who died at a high school in Florida.

248
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:24.140
But look what happened.
Look at all those kids hitting the streets.

249
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:28.160
Look at all these kids who through cell phones and selfies and Instagram and

250
00:15:28.161 --> 00:15:30.710
snapchat,
they're already ready for primetime.

251
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:35.960
You see these high school juniors in front of us,
CNN,
camera going,
hi,

252
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:38.300
I'm 17 years old.
This happened to my school,

253
00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.150
and next year I'm going to vote and here's what's going to happen and here's the

254
00:15:41.151 --> 00:15:45.410
march I'm starting.
I'm like,
oh,
that's a future senator.
You just,

255
00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:48.950
that school shooting just birthed a voting demographic.

256
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:52.670
Are you kidding?
All those kids are going to vote.
All of them,

257
00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.020
all those kids who marched,

258
00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.780
there's going to be no millennial apathy with those kids.

259
00:15:56.781 --> 00:15:57.614
They're all going to vote.

260
00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.590
I kind of have an idea what side they're going to vote with,

261
00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:04.490
and if you think you're going to sell those kids on their grandfather's drunk

262
00:16:04.491 --> 00:16:09.260
and homophobia,
racism and his overall bigotry and xenophobia,

263
00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:12.500
you're wrong.
He never had a pass where,
I don't need to travel.

264
00:16:12.501 --> 00:16:16.340
I don't want to meet some damn Mexican.
Trust me.
The kids going to travel,

265
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:17.630
he's going to go to India.

266
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:22.430
She's going to go to Columbia and meet other people and get a more global sense

267
00:16:22.431 --> 00:16:26.630
of the world,
a sense of water,
food,
energy,
where it comes from,

268
00:16:26.631 --> 00:16:30.170
where what happens with money,
what happens with mediocrity,
the danger of it.

269
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:33.710
So I think we're in for some tough times,

270
00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:35.690
but I think they're going to lead to good times.

271
00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.770
And so that's what if I get political on stage,
all I say is like,

272
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:44.060
here's five ways forward because the despair part you like,

273
00:16:44.061 --> 00:16:48.200
you need me to tell you,
you watch the news.
So don't get down in the mouth,

274
00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.170
start burning more calories and that,
and that's

275
00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:54.530
not my job.

276
00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:59.360
But I would never weigh in on stage any other way about that stuff.

277
00:16:59.361 --> 00:17:04.040
Cause all I would be as obvious and my audience is pretty sharp and they don't

278
00:17:04.041 --> 00:17:05.240
need to be told twice.

279
00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:11.300
Outstanding.
Thank you sir.
Well said.
I couldn't agree more.
