Gulf of Tonkin,
Eh,
or,
or,
or Jesse Smollett.
I mean,
I couldn't help,

2
00:00:03.901 --> 00:00:06.840
but I knew he'd probably sue me the day after it happened.
I said,

3
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:10.890
the guy's got a noose around his neck at 2:00 AM in,
in Chicago,

4
00:00:10.891 --> 00:00:14.160
and to cause a noose in Chicago who's walking around with a news,

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.840
who even knows how to write,
who,
who knows how to make a noose,
like who?

6
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.320
Then the cops show up 40 something minutes later and he's at the door with a

7
00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:26.790
noose around a snack,
homing subway sandwich.
Fake.
I said,
I said,

8
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.030
sue me,
destroy me by it's fate.
I can't help but see,
the problem is that's that.

9
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.560
That's where the psychosis comes in.
Because if you,

10
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.710
if you're a little kid is,
I've been read more about psychology,

11
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.030
trying to understand this stuff.

12
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.120
If you're a little kid and somebody with red hair beat you and tortured,

13
00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:47.590
you have a say man with red hair.
I'm just a hypothetical.
What?

14
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.370
You're going to not like guys with red hair.
So,
so,
so it's kind of like,

15
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.290
or if you've been lied to as a kid,
let it,

16
00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:53.700
that's what creates mental illness layer,
right?

17
00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:56.910
So we've been lucky with the media and the corporate system and seeing all these

18
00:00:56.911 --> 00:00:58.170
fake hoaxes and you know,

19
00:00:58.171 --> 00:01:01.060
the fake stuff about Cavenaugh and the face of about the coverage of kids and,

20
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.530
and the face of about smaller,
she,
that's now the public actually,

21
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.880
here's what's happening.
I'm getting huge backlash and small it,
it's not,

22
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.650
it's not,
wait a minute,
who's given you backlash?
And the public are like,
Hey,

23
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.270
smallest fake the coverage.
Kids are fake.
Polozzi Ford.

24
00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:20.130
And most of these women said it was all fake.

25
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.290
So why are you saying Sandy Hook's real?
Everything's fake.
And it's like,
no dude,

26
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.560
everything's not faith.
That's what I'm saying is the differential is gone.

27
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.400
And so yeah,
there's a bunch of fake stuff and we have a right to question it.

28
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.940
But now,
now,
then now the general public,

29
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:39.360
my fans believe everything's fake.
But let me stop you there.
I'm ranting.
I just,

30
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.590
it's okay.
I want you to ramp this,
but this is,
this is the nature of the beast.

31
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.110
This is what you're selling to a lot of these people.

32
00:01:46.111 --> 00:01:50.250
This is why they're tuning into you.
They want to hear you uncover conspiracies,

33
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.040
and some of them aren't as bright as others,

34
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:57.090
and some of them can't see logic.
They don't see it.
They don't understand.

35
00:01:57.091 --> 00:02:00.210
I'm legitimately questioning.
I don't just think everything's fake.
