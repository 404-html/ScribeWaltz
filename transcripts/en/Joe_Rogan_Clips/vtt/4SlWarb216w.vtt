1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.520
Two one boom.

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.580
So I took a four and a half hour ride down to San Diego cause my friend Brendan

3
00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:08.071
was felon,

4
00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:12.390
a showtime special and it was run the jewels the entire way down and back.

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.520
It was awesome.
Thank you.
Whoo.
I was,

6
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.750
I wish I could work out as hard as people work out.
Todd music.

7
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.910
Well I've lost 31 pounds,
but I'd be 90 pounds out easy now.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.780
That was one of the things that I would say this is workout music.
Yeah,
it is.

9
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.510
It is an elder in our Chubbies too fat,
but,

10
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.120
well you were saying you lost 31 pounds.
Yeah,

11
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.420
maybe picked up three over the holidays.
But I'm,
I'm,
I'm on my path.
I really am.

12
00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:43.230
Shouts out to Al Clayborne,
um,
who's from out here?
Who's a hell of a trainer?

13
00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:45.510
If I had his discipline,
I'd already be a hundred pounds down,

14
00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:49.550
but the gold is a hundred and the next 18 months you can do it.
Yeah,
I do 100%

15
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.660
just eat bad and got lazy.
But you know what,
man,
you could turn it.

16
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.810
It's one of those things where you just,
if you could stick with it for 90 days,

17
00:00:57.811 --> 00:01:00.330
it will become a part of your life.
Well that's the goal.
That's the goal.

18
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.180
You know what I mean?
And,
and,
and I'm about it like,

19
00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:06.780
cause I like meat so I still get to eat meat and I like green stuff and I don't

20
00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:10.430
like salad dressing.
So I think we're going to be relatively easy for me.
Yeah.

21
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.610
Like olive oil and vinegar does not taste bad bro.
I don't even use that.

22
00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:17.880
Like when I have a salad,
one wife make salad,
she literally will make the salad.

23
00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:20.410
She may add a little goat cheese or not you,
she'll,
you know,

24
00:01:20.411 --> 00:01:22.350
maybe she'll tell some chicken or some steak on there.

25
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.210
But if it's fruit in the salad,

26
00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:26.380
I don't need any salad dressing and just throw some strawberries,

27
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.030
apples or stuff to salting and just give me that strive Jewson and I'm good.

28
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.840
If I could figure it out during that three to four times a day versus the one

29
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:36.720
meal and with my wife and then he didn't like trashing the studio.
I'll be,

30
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.680
that's the problems from the temptation roles.
And you see burgers and fries.

31
00:01:40.681 --> 00:01:44.930
Yeah.
Fuck it.
You see a Coca Cola?
Yeah.
That,

32
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.600
that really is it for me.
So I had to quit sodas because the worst,

33
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.890
which is which is,
which brings me to cripple cola.
Yeah.
So what is critical can,

34
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.910
he gave me two bottles of it,
but I wanted to keep it in the fridge.

35
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.940
I want to enjoy it.
And it's perfect temperature,
Coca Cola,
Pepsi Cola,
RC color,

36
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.590
anything with Cola.
Right.

37
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.390
Has probably killed more Americans than anything else in the world.
Right.

38
00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:06.810
So anything that's Cola,

39
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.540
because Coca Cola was provided tons of jobs in my hometown.

40
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:12.090
I don't want to diss them.
They might promote a concert,
am I right?

41
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.390
But we know that sugary drinks aren't good for you.
Right.

42
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.800
Yet we don't have an aversion to,
we don't criminalize sugary.

43
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.440
And my doctor Larry told me,
Michael,
sugar is poison,
right?

44
00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:23.550
I want you to work it out of your diet.

45
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.360
But these kids that are members of these little punk ass street fraternity's

46
00:02:28.361 --> 00:02:32.850
essentially gangs we criminalize and villainize a bunch of teenagers who simply

47
00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:35.250
don't have anything to do.
They don't have jobs,
they don't have skills,

48
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.660
they don't have organization,

49
00:02:36.661 --> 00:02:38.850
they don't have police athletic league like they used to.

50
00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:42.090
They don't have people engaging them in academics or sports where they used to.

51
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.040
So they're just kind of,
you know,
mess off,

52
00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:46.860
fuck off sometimes fuck up and violence happens,
right?

53
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.790
If you could take those same kids with the entrepreneurial spirit that'll sell

54
00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:54.000
your water on the side of a highway and you add it to something to public

55
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:55.440
already wants anyway,
Cola,

56
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.620
you create something like Cripple Colin bipap and essentially what you're doing

57
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:03.880
is creating the same sugary shit that we all go buy and drink and we should.

58
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.720
And now we're given the structure of say a hell's angels to say,
yeah,

59
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.760
you could say we're a criminal organization,

60
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.990
but we still can sell your fucking tee shirt because we are now paid our taxes,

61
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:15.640
we're now employing people.
And we were now doing,

62
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.420
we're supposed to do and that's what I wanted to give the gift of my friends who

63
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:19.770
are hurt,

64
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.650
who are members of street fraternity's and we actually pulled it off at the
show.

65
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.300
These guys actually managed to bring something in microcosm to the market in

66
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:29.020
Atlanta.

67
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.350
It did well enough for us to keep continue doing it and I'm want to see how far

68
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:36.240
I can go and what's in it?
Sugar,
water,
artificial,

69
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.920
artificial arm.
What is it?
Food,
color and flavor and that's it.

70
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.610
I think it's six ingredients total.
Those guys.
Have you ever,

71
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.390
do you know what Zevia is even fuck with z?
I mean the fake sugar stuff you use,

72
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.560
it's no Zevia is a soft drinks that are made with Stevia.
Yeah,

73
00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:53.650
but the thing is like,
you know what I found out with me with sugar to,

74
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.120
it's either just do it or don't.

75
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.050
Like for me it's easier to do things that are actually a real just sugar,

76
00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:01.990
like a Mexican coke or just have,
you know,

77
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:05.220
some carbonated water with lemons in it.
I don't do well with irritation.

78
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.530
This Cadillac in the hand job.
I want the whole thing.
I know what you're saying,

79
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.930
but this stuff is good.
It's,
it's different.
It's just something,
my man who has,

80
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.860
who?
Justin Bieber,
he's did it.
It's just my,

81
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.590
I am such an addict as what the real thing.
Yeah.

82
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:21.520
So it doesn't make sense for me sometimes to tempt myself.
I'll Trump water.

83
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.730
I just,
I do a lot of water now,
a lot more water now.

84
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.410
And I do a lot of club soda with lime,
which I used to talk shit to LP about.

85
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.110
I a chicken white guy drinks and now it's l is ordering a fucking,

86
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.710
you know,
he's ordering a drink,
drink and I'm just like,
yeah,

87
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.710
I'll take a club soda in La.
That's good man.
If you could stick on that path.

88
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.090
Shouts out to my man Bariloche.
Um,
who is a friend and mentor.

89
00:04:46.091 --> 00:04:50.050
A lot of times you might see a guy with me who does security bear introduce me

90
00:04:50.051 --> 00:04:53.880
to Shaolin Kung Fu.
You mean basically kicking and punching and moving around.

91
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.660
He also introduced me to a lot of the guests that are on your show.
Um,
including,

92
00:04:58.661 --> 00:05:00.820
you know,
guests that talk about intermittent fasting,

93
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.920
the talks about getting rid of the sugars and stuff,

94
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.680
and he just loves me like a big brother.
So he keeps me in tune.

95
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:06.700
But what's going on.
