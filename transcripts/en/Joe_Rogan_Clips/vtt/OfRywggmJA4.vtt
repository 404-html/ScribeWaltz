Wait a gentleman.
Black helicopters have been spotted.
Yes,

Stop.

2
00:00:05.021 --> 00:00:05.854
What the fuck?

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.630
You almost hospitalized me one time from laughing so hard,
like,

4
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.410
I don't know if you remember this.
I'm serious.
I even know if I could tell it.

5
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.040
It was,
it was backstage.

6
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.920
It was backstage at his show.
We were somewhere and you were like,

7
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.600
how's the way
you and I go,

8
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.470
you go,
where is she?
And I said,
I said some city in Tennessee,

9
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.110
maybe not or Nashville.

10
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.440
And you go to Nashville 96 and you started the story about working in a club and

11
00:00:41.651 --> 00:00:45.760
you're like,
I just riffed in between shows some crazy shit.

12
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.400
Some chick who was talking.
There was eight people for that.

13
00:00:48.401 --> 00:00:52.210
There was 20 people for the first show,
Knoxville.
It was a comedy zone show.

14
00:00:52.211 --> 00:00:55.900
I have booked it.
Knoxville's a great little fucking town,

15
00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.400
like a cute little Tennessee town.
It's like hip.
It's a football,
you know,

16
00:01:00.401 --> 00:01:04.360
like a college town.
So I get down on Friday night,
Joe Rogan,
I'm headlining.

17
00:01:04.361 --> 00:01:08.430
I got 38 minutes.
I just moved to La and I signed,

18
00:01:08.431 --> 00:01:11.710
we creative management and they booked those rooms.

19
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.550
So they were booking me out as a headline.
I was just dying slope that,

20
00:01:15.551 --> 00:01:19.960
so what they did was they put me in one nighters that paid like two 75 at night.

21
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.810
They weren't bad,
quite Tennessee,
you know,

22
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.020
and we'd go to this Knoxville for two nights and I go in there and you know,

23
00:01:26.021 --> 00:01:29.470
made the,
I'm fucking crazy.
First one,
I go in there too.

24
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.670
Friday night there's 20 people for the first show and there's a girl,

25
00:01:33.671 --> 00:01:38.620
Joe Rogan that's a 12 with a guy that's a fault.
Okay.

26
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.180
And it's her birthday,
you know,
meanwhile through it,

27
00:01:41.181 --> 00:01:46.120
she just turned 21 it's her birthday.
Okay.
Hi.
Happy Birthday.

28
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.790
What's going on here?
You know,
because once you start hearing noise,

29
00:01:48.791 --> 00:01:51.080
you would have to react with as a common and you're going,

30
00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:53.650
what's going on here was 21 I said,
you're very beautiful.

31
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.270
And then she just went and ran with it and started talking about how a husband

32
00:01:58.271 --> 00:01:59.104
pimps are out.

33
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.550
He would have fights on and for 20 bucks you could fuck her in the back room.

34
00:02:03.551 --> 00:02:07.440
20 fights were on whatever.
I don't know that I'm Fridays.

35
00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:10.780
He would bring it to the construction trucks.
Oh my.

36
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.950
You wouldn't bring a truck with her to the construction site and put a mattress

37
00:02:14.951 --> 00:02:19.030
in the back and at lunch time that he would let her friends and she's telling me

38
00:02:19.031 --> 00:02:19.840
this.

39
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.790
It's like she's talking and people like Mike just holding that breasts like what

40
00:02:24.791 --> 00:02:29.350
is going on here?
This girl is beautiful and this retard is just pimping up.

41
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.410
So in between shows,

42
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.980
I go upstairs to do a line of smoke a joint or whatever the fuck I'm doing.

43
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.260
When I come back and I see her by herself,

44
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.800
when we started talking to them about what's going on,
oh my God,

45
00:02:41.801 --> 00:02:45.990
I had such a great time.
I go,
what's that stuff?
True?
And she goes,
yeah,

46
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.550
go show me the monkey.
And she caught me in the woman's bathroom,

47
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.740
pull down the pants.
The girl had a monkey that was spotless.
It nearly stunk.

48
00:02:53.741 --> 00:02:57.700
I ate it.
I find it a some.
And then she sucked my Dick.
That was it.

49
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.030
I went back to room.
I didn't think nothing of it.
I'm like,
Jesus Christ.

50
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.090
I go back for the second show,
there's eight people,

51
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.490
but by the time I go back for the second show,
Joe Rogan,

52
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.790
she's sitting in the back,
she's turning one and she's looking at me like this.

53
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.900
She's fucked up and 10 minutes into my spot set cause I was headlining.

54
00:03:17.691 --> 00:03:21.470
She starts going,
I sucked the Comedians Dick Tonight and the husband was like,

55
00:03:21.471 --> 00:03:23.360
what are you talking about?
And she's like,

56
00:03:23.361 --> 00:03:25.670
I sucked his dick and he came in my mouth and he's like,

57
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.300
what the fuck are you talking about?
The cops had to hold him back and he's like,

58
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.660
I want my $40 that's all he wanted.

59
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.400
He didn't care that his wife Suck my dick at this comedy backroom.
Oh my God.

60
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.620
When the cops came,
he kept saying,
man,

61
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.090
somebody is going to get hurt if I don't have my $40 that's a $40 blow job.

62
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.980
Did you come in her mouth?
Because if I wouldn't have come,

63
00:03:46.981 --> 00:03:51.350
it would've been like 20 or he cared about was the $40 dog.

64
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.950
So he told me that backstage at your show and I fucking started hyperventilating

65
00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.660
$40 for his wife.

66
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.503
<v 1>Okay,</v>

67
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.180
<v 0>this is the world.
Allow me,
ladies and gentlemen,</v>

68
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.150
this is the world of crazy fucking calmly.

69
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:13.330
You think that's crazy.

70
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.380
Why she's crying.

71
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.300
Some of the Haggadah going to harm his wife and said,
you know,
Nah,

72
00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:26.420
he didn't care.
He just wanted to $40 for a blow job.
I didn't give it to him.

73
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.000
He's got rules and he got to give him that.

74
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.760
He's got like a line in the sand.
This has got,
he's got not much.

75
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.070
These are fucking crazy animal.

76
00:04:37.071 --> 00:04:40.550
When you sit at home at night and you think about all the Shit we've seen and

77
00:04:40.551 --> 00:04:43.190
we've learned a lot,
I don't think I've ever laughed as hard.

78
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.470
Well that's probably the second time right there on that road.

79
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.700
We want to a lot of things.
You went a lot of things about human beings,

80
00:04:48.701 --> 00:04:52.110
you and one of the things about an individual,
you learn some grabbing.

81
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.450
I did American home.
It's a,
uh,

82
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.870
armed forces place in Idaho.
It's part of the triple one.

83
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.460
And this one's like walked in and I had to go meet,
do a sound check.

84
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.030
Everybody kept looking at me going,
hi,
how are you?
Have you met sandy yet?

85
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.900
And I go,
no.
And they go and they can walk away.
You ever see a,

86
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.700
what's the movie with Eddie Murphy when he,
with Boomerang?
Yeah.

87
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.620
When he goes to the black chicks house,
it's the 80.

88
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.070
And the Butler keeps laughing.
Remember the Butler would go,
you have to,

89
00:05:22.071 --> 00:05:25.580
she wants to see in the kitchen.
He would go,
because she knew he was gonna.

90
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.200
She was gonna rape him.
So every time some people would refer to as Shirley,

91
00:05:30.201 --> 00:05:34.550
they go,
have you met Shirley?
And you go,
no.
And they go,
oh.

92
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.590
And they'd walk away.
Will surely,

93
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.360
whether the captain of that base was the head of the base,
she was his wife.

94
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.640
And if a band came to town or a comedian came to town,
she blew it.

95
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.420
That's it.
That was the rule.

96
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.220
Like he and he would sit out there with his fucking military arm and all his

97
00:05:54.221 --> 00:05:59.180
shit and clap and she'd be in the back.
Sue mink cause the whole band.

98
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.660
I mean this is crazy.
So I didn't know about this.

99
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:05.580
She came over and started talking to me and then she started telling all your

100
00:06:05.581 --> 00:06:09.050
Cuban,
I dated a Cuban one time.
He had such a big thick,
do you have a big thing?

101
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:12.830
I mean it was that quick list.
It was that quick.
Like she just gets to it.

102
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.360
She's like 15 I was maybe like 31 she was maybe 50 wow.

103
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.850
Cause she just dropped behind the curtain.
It took the hammer out.

104
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.440
I'm sitting there minding my own business and also somebody comes yelling for

105
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.710
Shirley,
Shirley,
Shirley.

106
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.710
Now usually surely we get up and stop sucking a dick.

107
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.200
Not surely she moved her knees like I had neon belly.
Right.

108
00:06:35.201 --> 00:06:38.000
Then when somebody puts me on belly,
he's supposed to move this way.
Right.

109
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.470
That's what she did with her knees.

110
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.440
She kept sucking and just kept moving this way.
She,

111
00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:46.070
I tried to take it out of her mouth.
She wouldn't let him.
She's like,
no,
no,
no.

112
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.700
She,
she wouldn't stop until,
I mean,
and they're like,
Shirley,

113
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.730
if we out here,
man,
this is crazy shit.
I can't,

114
00:06:55.731 --> 00:06:56.720
I'm overstimulated.

115
00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:03.230
I feel like I need psychiatric treatment right now and Ivy fucking drink.

116
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:05.600
I love Maine.
Kiss.

117
00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:10.340
His greatest thing anyone's ever said that is the best word of all mean gives

118
00:07:10.341 --> 00:07:14.720
you Sukala mink
oil.

119
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.970
It's mean Kia.
But when they say Sukkah they cut it short.

120
00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:23.360
What is the word?
What does it mean mean?
Gimme Suck my Dick.
Mika.

121
00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:27.310
In a dilute the Sukkah mean suck.
Right,

You know,

122
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.210
it's so weird how the more banish this is Italian Sicilian really chill.

123
00:07:32.211 --> 00:07:34.970
The deeper you go down to boot,
the more,

124
00:07:34.971 --> 00:07:38.360
is it closer to Spain or is it farther from Spain?

125
00:07:38.361 --> 00:07:43.340
The closer at Lee is from Spain.
When people from that area,
so to speak,

126
00:07:43.341 --> 00:07:45.860
Italian,
I don't care how fast that talking,

127
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.490
they can't put the wool over me because I could pick up every fort worth.
Oh,

128
00:07:49.491 --> 00:07:54.160
right.
So Sicilian say Sukkah what's sucking Spanish too?
Buh.

129
00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.830

132
