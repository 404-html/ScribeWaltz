WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.760
We'll just cut you off.
I got to train more.
Kill me.

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.950
So fucking it is so cut off so you could keep training.
Wow.
So Nick and him,

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.750
they've got some screws loose,
but they're committed.

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.540
How committed are you that you want to achieve this goal?
This dream,
his dream.

5
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.570
He grew up in New Jersey.
He's like,
I want to be a wrestler and so I'm going to,

6
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.510
I'm going to do this incredibly inspirational guy.

7
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.010
So him and 12 other guys came over to our airbnb and we watched the fights and

8
00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:29.940
it was controversial Khabib and we loved watching everything that night and then

9
00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:31.350
whenever that happened.
Um,

10
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.650
so I'm torn on it because I love those guys as fighters,

11
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.050
absolutely love them as fighters.
Um,

12
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.290
and then whenever that happened to just something that in me,
I don't,

13
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.900
I don't know if I was embarrassed or if I was disappointed,

14
00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:44.930
but they were introducing some guys,
uh,

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.780
Steve Weatherford who played for the New York giants.
He came over for like a,

16
00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:52.320
he played for the giants for like 10 or 12 years,
um,
lives in San Diego.

17
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.750
Great Guy.
But he's not a big MMA fan.

18
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:57.660
So I was explaining everything to him and when that happened is just pretty

19
00:00:57.661 --> 00:01:01.410
disappointing.
Then I spoke at,
um,
at,
uh,

20
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.440
anti bullying coalition in Tulsa and I went there and there's a girl there that,

21
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.450
uh,
she looked real sweet,
real quiet,
introverted,
um,

22
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.400
and she worked with mental health and her name was alley.

23
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.460
All of a sudden she found out I was an MMA fighter and she said,
oh my gosh,

24
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.370
you know,
my husband's a huge MMA fan.
I'm not at all.

25
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.140
I never really even sat down and watched it with him.

26
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.910
But then he decided to take me to the t-mobile arena for the,

27
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.730
her first fight was Conor,
Khabib and uh,

28
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.680
she was in there and she said she loved it before that Michelle Waterson was an

29
00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:35.970
incredible inspiration to her,

30
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.860
her saying that she wants to be the first mom to be a UFC champion.
She said it,

31
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.020
the night was going great,
and then whenever that happened she said it was,

32
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.560
it literally scared her because fight started popping off to the right over

33
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.430
leftover behind her.
She sent out,
poured out into their arena.
Um,

34
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.390
and so that was her first introduction to May.
So I was a little tough to see,

35
00:01:54.391 --> 00:01:57.900
but at the same time,
I get it.
Like those emotions are flaring.

36
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.840
And you were talking about it too,
and,
uh,

37
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.830
kind of your perspective of martial artists and,
yeah,
I mean,
same thing that,

38
00:02:04.831 --> 00:02:06.720
that you were feeling.
Just,
you know,

39
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.510
that little bit of kind of sadness and disappointment of,
you know,
the,

40
00:02:11.511 --> 00:02:15.150
the biggest event,
the most views,
the most people watching.

41
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.090
And that's the last thing that they see.
That's what they,
you know,

42
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.260
go to bed thinking about and feeling about.
And,
and I just,
you know,

43
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.010
I don't think,
uh,
even Keven Connor,
it could be,

44
00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:29.130
that's not who they are as martial artists,
you know,
uh,
sure.

45
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.110
All the emotions were flying and they,
you know,
they have a history and,

46
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.010
and it's hard to let that go,
but I,
I just don't,

47
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.160
I don't feel like that's even who they really are.

48
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:45.280
You see in all their other fights,
uh,
they,
they respect their opponents.
You know,

49
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.160
I'm gonna disagree with you.
Um,
I mean,
look,
Connor,

50
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.820
that's what he does.
Yeah.
He Talk Shit to people and fucks with their head.

51
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:54.220
I mean it's,

52
00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.800
it's a giant part of his game and I know that that was part of the strategy of

53
00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:00.010
him throwing that Dolly

54
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.570
<v 1>at the bus.
That shit's way out of line.
I mean,
throwing a Dolly at the bus,</v>

55
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:07.660
that's not what a martial artist does.
When you,
when you,

56
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:12.580
if you stop and think about what we value about martial arts and turns of

57
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:17.380
teaching children honor when we were respect and discipline and the,
the things,

58
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:21.550
when we think of as a classical martial artists like Leo to Machida or something

59
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:25.570
like that,
bowing to their opponent that does not,
this is,

60
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.430
this is theatrical [inaudible].
This is hype.
But in all fairness,

61
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.710
the UFC used that to sell that fight.
I mean,

62
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:36.250
there was a big part of their promotional campaign was seeing Connor throw the

63
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:40.270
Dolly at the bus and the screaming,
the yelling,
you know,
you're setting,

64
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.370
you're setting an exam.

65
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.000
There's something going on outside of the actual contest itself.

66
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.090
There's all this extra credit,
curricular violence,
right?

67
00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:51.670
There's throwing a dollar at a bus shattering in the window.

68
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.470
All these guys running and screaming,

69
00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:57.130
get off the bus and then they're promoting this.
They're showing this,

70
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.140
and then everyone's shocked.
Then it escalates after the fight itself.

71
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.890
You know,
one of the,
in some ways,

72
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.480
one of the more interesting moments of the fight was Khabib on top ICAN or

73
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:14.140
beaten the shit out of him going,
let's talk now.
Have you seen that video?
Yeah.

74
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.260
That's fucking terrifying.
It's like,
come on,
let's talk.
Bam.

75
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:18.710
And he's just slamming them.
Bam.

76
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.250
Told him he's got to do that before the fight too.
I mean,
yeah,

77
00:04:21.251 --> 00:04:21.881
we're going to talk.

78
00:04:21.881 --> 00:04:24.730
We're going to talk when I'm on top of you and you're tired and I'm beating the

79
00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:27.550
fuck out of you.
That's what we're going to talk.
And that's what he did.
You know,

80
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.030
this is all not what could be does.

81
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.840
This is outside of his,
his,

82
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.680
if you look at his standard behavior,
he's very respectful.
I mean,

83
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:41.110
he's never had an incident like this ever in a fight.

84
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.880
All of his fights before that,
or him shaking his opponent's hand,

85
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.400
doing the standard stare down standard stuff,

86
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.320
talking about his skill set and what he's gonna do.
And there's no disrespect.

87
00:04:53.321 --> 00:04:56.890
There's no insults.
There's none of this.
That's what I mean about Khabib.
Yeah,

88
00:04:56.891 --> 00:05:00.610
but not Connor.
I mean,
this is a,
but,
but here's the other thing.

89
00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:02.650
On the other side,
it makes it fun.

90
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.480
I'm very torn because all the shit that he talked to,
Josie Aldo,
look,

91
00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:09.130
that was a big factor.

92
00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:14.131
And Josie Aldo charging at him losing his composure face first and getting clip

93
00:05:14.471 --> 00:05:15.490
at that left hand.

94
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.870
That's a big factor is the emotional anx that he had gone through from months

95
00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:22.460
and months on the road with this guy.
The middle of warfare.
Yeah.

96
00:05:22.461 --> 00:05:26.140
I mean that mental warfare is a real thing.
It just didn't work with Khabib.

97
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.770
He'd have the opposite effect and with could be.
He's like,

98
00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:33.040
I can't wait to get my fucking hands on you.
It wasn't,

99
00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:36.760
I can't believe this guy's saying these things to me with could be bad,

100
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.480
but it ramped up the violence to the point where he was letting you know like,

101
00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:43.300
Hey,
this is real to me.
Like if you,

102
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.260
if you want to act thuggish and we'll just keep going,
we'll just,
I'll tell you,

103
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.740
I'll keep taking this.
Like he didn't want to stop after Connor tapped,

104
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.980
like he was holding onto him and he's letting them know,
hey motherfucker,

105
00:05:53.981 --> 00:05:58.070
like this is real.
This is not just shit talking.
Connor was saying to him,

106
00:05:58.071 --> 00:06:01.640
this is just business.
It's just business.
And he's like,
let's talk now.

107
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.240
Let's talk now.
Like he,
he's like,
this is not business to him.

108
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.740
So to him fights,
I mean this is what he said in the press conference.

109
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.950
It should be,
this is a respect sport and this should just,

110
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.660
sports should be about two men expressing themselves to the best of their

111
00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:19.550
physical ability inside the cage,

112
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.570
just doing their best against the best fighters in the world.

113
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.380
And that should speak for itself and that they should have respect and honor

114
00:06:27.381 --> 00:06:31.400
outside of it.
I wish you would have had the chance to say that,
you know,

115
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.630
we didn't have a chance.

116
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:37.660
The sad part was him letting the emotions take over what he felt and instead of

117
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:41.750
just getting the belt tied on and kind of killing them with kindness at the end

118
00:06:41.751 --> 00:06:46.650
and saying that,
having that chance to put that in everyone's minds and ears.

119
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.530
He did in the post fight interview.

120
00:06:48.531 --> 00:06:51.020
But I mean how many are the post fight press conference.

121
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.550
But how many people got a chance to see that?

122
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.290
I mean just a few thousand I'm sure.

123
00:06:55.291 --> 00:06:58.940
And as in comparison to the 2.4 million,
the download,

124
00:06:58.941 --> 00:07:00.410
the paper view and the many,
many,
many,

125
00:07:00.411 --> 00:07:04.790
many more that saw you to eclipse and Instagram's clips.
Yeah,

126
00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:06.770
I mean everybody saw it.
It's,

127
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:11.030
it's unfortunate but it's also a financial windfall.

128
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.380
Like it's like the whole thing.

129
00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:17.381
It's weird because part of what makes Connor so interesting is that he's so good

130
00:07:18.561 --> 00:07:22.370
at talk that shit.
He's hilarious and he knows how to back it up.

131
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:27.380
But when we saw him fight Khabib,
he just,
he fell short.

132
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.470
But it's really that simple when skill versus skill.

133
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.010
He felt short and the the,

134
00:07:33.011 --> 00:07:38.011
the shit talking led to Qbe Being v taking it very personal and very personal at

135
00:07:39.861 --> 00:07:44.861
the end and pointing a Dylan Dennis and jumping off the top of the cage.

136
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.750
The whole thing was just,
it's so fucking crazy.

137
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:52.750
But the idea that people should be surprised after Connor frozen Dolly at the

138
00:07:52.821 --> 00:07:57.290
bus and then still winds up able to fight.
I mean just,
what did he do?

139
00:07:57.291 --> 00:08:02.210
Paid some money.
Did some,
I mean he's got to do some,
some service.

140
00:08:02.211 --> 00:08:04.550
What does he does community service.
I don't even know what he has to do.

141
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.960
I don't either.
It was something that's where it's not.
Yeah,
it's Kinda crazy.

142
00:08:07.961 --> 00:08:10.820
Me throwing a Dolly is fucking way worse.

143
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:15.320
Then punching a guy who punches people for a living,
which is done.

144
00:08:15.321 --> 00:08:18.140
Dennis is a professional fighter.
He's a professional fighter.
He jumps out,

145
00:08:18.141 --> 00:08:20.900
he takes a swing at them,
they're screaming.
He and Dylan is like,
fuck you.

146
00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:21.651
And he's like,
fuck you.

147
00:08:21.651 --> 00:08:24.350
And there's a bunch of people get involved and then a bunch of other people jump

148
00:08:24.351 --> 00:08:26.810
in.
The whole thing was nuts.

149
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:32.030
But the idea that we should be shocked after him throwing a Dolly at a bus

150
00:08:32.031 --> 00:08:36.980
because Khabib's on the bus that those Russians don't fucking play like that

151
00:08:36.981 --> 00:08:39.800
man.
This video is afterwards when Doug Stone,

152
00:08:39.801 --> 00:08:43.520
where they're shooting up uzis and they can 47.
So I wrestled there,
uh,

153
00:08:43.521 --> 00:08:47.000
when I was like 18,
um,
wrestled there and it was crazy.

154
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.240
They were taking us around everywhere in g wagons and the ones in front of us

155
00:08:50.241 --> 00:08:53.420
had like armed,
uh,
I don't know,
machine guns on top of them.

156
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.180
The one behind us are machine guns on top of them.
Um,

157
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.820
<v 0>and then what was it?
We were,</v>

158
00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:01.920
we were walking through one of the streets and there's these big chains that are

159
00:09:01.921 --> 00:09:06.240
in between the road and the sidewalk and we're walking down the sidewalk and all

160
00:09:06.241 --> 00:09:10.980
of a sudden there's like a laser that comes over and,
uh,
and our guys are like,

161
00:09:10.981 --> 00:09:14.220
we gotta go,
we gotta go.
All of a sudden a car came up onto the sidewalk,

162
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.930
started driving like they're going to play us down.

163
00:09:15.931 --> 00:09:19.220
We had to jump into the road to not get hit.
And uh,
I,

164
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:23.520
I don't know why that happened,
but after that we weren't allowed our,
uh,

165
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.360
the hotel we were in,
we had like balconies to where we could look out,
well,

166
00:09:27.361 --> 00:09:30.600
they had to move our rooms to where we're inside to where we couldn't have a

167
00:09:30.601 --> 00:09:34.920
balcony and everything else to where the,
the,
just because of that threat,

168
00:09:34.921 --> 00:09:38.490
because of the laser that came because of the truck that came up onto the

169
00:09:38.491 --> 00:09:40.050
sidewalk and tried to run us over,

170
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:45.130
there was some crazy rumor that someone got arrested outside of the t mobile

171
00:09:45.601 --> 00:09:47.070
arena.
See if that's true.

172
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:52.100
If someone got arrested with a gun outside the t mobile arena on after the fight

173
00:09:52.891 --> 00:09:55.650
or during the fight because it was,

174
00:09:55.651 --> 00:09:58.110
there was some sort of crazy talk about threats.

175
00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.260
The problem is you don't know how much of that's bullshit.
Right.
You know,
I mean,

176
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.660
I probably should have researched that before we talked about it,

177
00:10:03.661 --> 00:10:07.650
but you see anything bullshit out of,

178
00:10:07.651 --> 00:10:12.190
did they post that?
You know,
I heard the same thing though.

179
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.830
I heard.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I think I heard it on Instagram,
but yeah,

180
00:10:16.831 --> 00:10:20.280
they don't play around their honors.
Yeah.
Different world man.

181
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.700
Especially Dagestan that's all hard part of the country.

182
00:10:23.701 --> 00:10:26.940
Not the Dublin isn't hard,
but it's like that.

183
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:30.580
They're not known for their,
uh,
humor and shit.

184
00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.490
Yeah.
Well,
I,
well I went into a store,

185
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.011
I went into a store,

186
00:10:38.011 --> 00:10:41.730
like a little market and I was whistling and Dagestan and I didn't know that

187
00:10:41.731 --> 00:10:42.960
that was something disrespectful,

188
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.300
but someone came right up behind me and just slap me on the back of the head.

189
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.100
Like,
Whoa,
hold them.
I'd probably like,

190
00:10:47.101 --> 00:10:49.890
it could be just dad came up and I knew that he was a bad dude,

191
00:10:49.891 --> 00:10:50.790
so I wasn't going to do anything.

192
00:10:50.791 --> 00:10:52.710
I just didn't know translator had to come up and say,

193
00:10:52.711 --> 00:10:55.260
you don't whistle in public,
you know,
Oh,
you're having a good day,

194
00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:01.050
then I can't even whistle that good.
But,
uh,

195
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.830
but it was just kind of whistling and myself,
I didn't even know I was doing it.

196
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:05.890
Yeah,
that's probably that,

197
00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:10.340
that's probably that they don't show the bottom of your feet.
Like if you,
uh,

198
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.970
that's for sure you can Google that.

199
00:11:11.971 --> 00:11:15.000
But if you are sitting there and you like cross your legs and you show the

200
00:11:15.001 --> 00:11:19.780
bottom of your foot,
that's culturally really disrespectful to show,
um,
the,
yeah,

201
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:21.720
bottoms of your shoes or your,
the bottom of your feet.

202
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:26.490
So they just don't play around there.
Um,
and then,
so if you have your,

203
00:11:26.491 --> 00:11:30.810
like your foot on top of your thigh like this,
don't do that.
Don't do that.

204
00:11:30.811 --> 00:11:33.900
Someone would come and slap your leg and you make sure your feet are both on the

205
00:11:33.901 --> 00:11:36.670
ground.
Just a lot of cultural stuff.

206
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:41.010
That's why they're so tough.
Always climbing up those mountains.
Uh,

207
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.110
I mean it's just jagged mountains.

208
00:11:43.111 --> 00:11:45.210
I remember it as one of the most beautiful places I've ever been.

209
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:50.060
I'm just stunning.
But just the,
the hard life.
Did you see that?
A Nike or,
sorry,

210
00:11:50.061 --> 00:11:54.250
not Nike,
but Reebok video that could beep did as it was.
It was awesome.

211
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:57.810
<v 1>It was awesome.
But just seeing that that's,
that's the real life there.
It's,</v>

212
00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:01.960
there's a photo of him that he posted a on his Instagram with his father,

213
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.720
him and his father standing right after the fight.

214
00:12:04.721 --> 00:12:09.670
He did it like to explain like that this,
this what this is about to him.

215
00:12:09.671 --> 00:12:11.200
His honor.
It's not about money.

216
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:15.550
It's about honor and respect and it's a photo of him standing with his father

217
00:12:15.551 --> 00:12:19.250
with this incredible mountain range behind him.
Wow.
Yeah.
It's a,

218
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:24.790
it's a different part of the world.
So that,
that strategy with Connor backfired.

219
00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:29.400
But do you think there's a point where,
uh,
you know,
the set is,

220
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:34.810
that's incredible.
What a photo that they should say,
hey,

221
00:12:34.811 --> 00:12:39.100
let's,
let's turn the talking down a little bit.
That's what,

222
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.230
that's what got Connor to the dance.
I mean,

223
00:12:41.231 --> 00:12:43.480
it's one of the reasons why it has escalated.

224
00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:48.480
It has to then Mayweather bringing in his dad and the assault and different

225
00:12:48.911 --> 00:12:53.350
stuff like that and then could be going after his religion,
right?
Yes.
Yeah,

226
00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:56.230
yeah.
So it's,
it's gotten,
it's almost like he has to,

227
00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:59.270
I think you were saying that this,
he's got one up ourself.
Right.
And,

228
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.830
and for me it just kind of felt like,
you know,
it wasn't a surprise.

229
00:13:02.831 --> 00:13:07.660
It was kind of like the Karma for the UFC promoting the bus and you know,
and,

230
00:13:07.661 --> 00:13:11.710
and letting it just keep getting deeper and deeper.
You know,

231
00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:13.900
say it's the story and it is the story,

232
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.920
but at a certain point if it's something that was illegal hurt somebody,

233
00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:18.850
maybe you don't use that.

234
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.330
I was honestly shocked that they were using it and promotion.
I was like,
wow,

235
00:13:22.331 --> 00:13:26.070
I shouldn't be shocked.
I thought that when I saw the promo and I saw the,
the,

236
00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:26.400
the,

237
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:30.280
the Dolly flying at the bus and then the video from the inside with the glass

238
00:13:30.281 --> 00:13:34.000
shattering,
I was like,
okay,
I guess I shouldn't be shocked because it did happen.

239
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:37.630
You know,
it is a part of the story,
but I mean,
is this,
is this encouraging this,

240
00:13:37.631 --> 00:13:39.070
like what is,
I mean,

241
00:13:39.071 --> 00:13:43.030
they're using it to sell the biggest fight in the history of the sport turned

242
00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:46.120
out to be true.
It is the biggest fight and the history of the sport.

243
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.890
Is that good?
That doesn't seem good,
but it seems,

244
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.690
it seems from my perspective,
but it's,
you know,

245
00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:59.710
it's intertainment versus sport,
right.

246
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.790
When it comes to sport,
like you would never use that to,

247
00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.140
to advertise the Olympics.
Right?
Right.

248
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.990
They would never have an assault to advertise the Olympics.

249
00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:11.800
But this is something different.
It's commerce.
There's a lot of money involved.

250
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.810
It's a,
it's a huge cultural spectacle.
It's Conor Mcgregor,

251
00:14:16.811 --> 00:14:19.390
who's,
he transcends sport.

252
00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:24.391
He's this superstar in just the world of just show business.

253
00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.880
So it's different but different.
But yeah.
