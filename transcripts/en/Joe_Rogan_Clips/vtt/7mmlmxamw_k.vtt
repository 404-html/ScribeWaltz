00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.790
Hello Freak bitches.
I got a question for you man.
Okay.
So,

2
00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:09.810
um,
I've been a fan of you for a long time,
right?
So what,
thank you,

3
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.080
I appreciate it.
I appreciate you.
Appreciate you.
What uh,
what,
uh,

4
00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:18.900
made you made the switch from like being a moon landing denier to like,

5
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.300
you're fucking crazy if we didn't,
if you don't know,

6
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.610
<v 1>I don't think we're crazy.
No,
this is,
this is my,
my take on it.</v>

7
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.220
Absolutely.
I don't know enough about astrophysics,

8
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.060
about space travel,
about the science that's,
you know,
the,
the,

9
00:00:34.061 --> 00:00:38.770
the work that's been done about how to get a rock a rocket to the moon and back

10
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.630
definitely don't know enough.
It's rocket science.

11
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.530
And I've looked at a lot of very compelling documentaries that explain why they

12
00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:52.330
think it was hoaxed and they'll show you some footage and you can look at some

13
00:00:52.331 --> 00:00:53.920
of the footage and it looks fake as fuck.

14
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.160
There's some footage that to me looks really doctored.

15
00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.740
There's some Dell yet to this day.
Some guy would,

16
00:00:59.741 --> 00:01:02.870
when you ever seen ones where it looks like they're on wire.
So to astronauts on,

17
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.810
on wires I have,
there's somewhere,

18
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.530
there's a video where they look at their own trampoline and they're bouncing

19
00:01:08.531 --> 00:01:12.340
around on trampolines.
The physics are different in different videos.

20
00:01:12.341 --> 00:01:13.360
This is where it gets weird.

21
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.570
Like the physics are different from the Apollo 11 moon landing.

22
00:01:16.571 --> 00:01:18.670
We see him waddle around on the surface of the moon.

23
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.290
They moving at like half speed and then you see them in other ones like the one

24
00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:26.140
where they bounce around the air,
you're like,
well,
they're moving different.

25
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.860
They're in the same thing,
but it looks different.
The first one was very grainy.

26
00:01:29.861 --> 00:01:34.450
They showed it on a projection screen,
right?
It's,

27
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.690
there's,
there's uh,
there's a couple different possibilities.

28
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.790
One possibility is it just looks weird because it's on the moon and your brain

29
00:01:42.791 --> 00:01:44.380
is trying to interpret it and your brain's going,

30
00:01:44.381 --> 00:01:47.950
well that's fake because you don't really understand with one six or as gravity

31
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.510
really does to a body of it.
That's one possibility.
Another possibility,

32
00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:57.511
which has been shown to be true is that some of the stuff that they passed off

33
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.060
as being legitimate photographs of space travel was actually test runs where

34
00:02:04.211 --> 00:02:07.540
they blacked out the background and pretended that they were in space.

35
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.950
And there's one really clear example of this is Michael Collins.
Michael Collins,

36
00:02:11.951 --> 00:02:15.370
who was a guy who was a board Apollo 11,
right?
And Gemini 15.

37
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.630
There's a photo of him,
uh,
in uh,

38
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.460
the middle of a sea of what does it,

39
00:02:21.461 --> 00:02:24.550
when they walk around outside the space water,
it's called spacebar.

40
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.020
Why does that seem like a bad word?
It's like spacewalk.

41
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.520
Like if it doesn't seem like that's the official title I middle of a space walk

42
00:02:30.521 --> 00:02:34.690
is probably something more,
a little more syllables.
Yeah,
something slicker.

43
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.870
Anyway,
so he's doing the space walk and he's got this harness on,

44
00:02:37.871 --> 00:02:42.871
he's holding onto this like thing and it was apparently it just an image that

45
00:02:43.631 --> 00:02:48.631
had already been published of him in a training exercise and they blacked out

46
00:02:48.641 --> 00:02:52.000
the background and flipped the picture upside down.
That's the joint right there.

47
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.610
So same exact photo.
Same exact photo.

48
00:02:54.611 --> 00:02:57.630
I mean people have lined it up and switched it over.
It's the same photo.

49
00:02:57.631 --> 00:02:58.630
It's just been edited.

50
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.960
So I'm one on the left was them practicing how to use these.

51
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.800
I don't get sad.
The harness is some sort of a thing that he's hanging onto it.

52
00:03:07.801 --> 00:03:09.350
I guess it moves them around a little bit.
Right?

53
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.690
They were trying to practice it on the left and the right.
They just pass it off.

54
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.230
But those are publicity photos.
Right?
All right,
so you've got to go.
Well,
okay,

55
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.880
well who approves a publicity pose?

56
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:23.881
It could easily be just some idiot who works in the publicity department who

57
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:27.760
didn't marketing and who didn't think they had enough photos from the moon that

58
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:31.240
we're good of spacewalks it's probably insanely difficult to take a spacewalk

59
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:34.960
photo.
So does that mean that they faked the moon landing?
No,

60
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.820
but it means that people fake things.

61
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.910
So you've got to throw it like gotta be really objective and looking at that.

62
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.340
Okay.
So people say fake things.

63
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.750
They definitely filmed a lot of the,
um,

64
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.050
the training exercises that they did of the moon landing.

65
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.960
It filmed a lot of shit.
They definitely did.

66
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.160
If that is already been proven that they took this fake photograph and they

67
00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:02.050
tried to pass it off as a real space.
Why?

68
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.560
It's entirely possible that some of the stuff that they filmed,

69
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.670
they made out to look like they were on the moon when they were not.

70
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.320
But does that mean they didn't go to the moon?
No,
it doesn't.

71
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.060
And so when I was saying it proves that they didn't go to the moon.
I,

72
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.540
my critique of myself is that I didn't look at it objectively because I wanted

73
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:28.840
one conclusion to be true and I wanted that conclusion to be that the moon

74
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.460
landing was fake.
So I looked at it and I was,
and I was saying to myself,
okay,

75
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.020
did I come to this conclusion?

76
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.860
Because there's a lot of evidence that shows it to be fake or have I seen a lot

77
00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:42.490
of evidence that looks fake?
And does that mean that they didn't go to the moon?

78
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.790
No,
it doesn't.
There's,
there's a bunch of different possibilities.

79
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.860
There's a ton of different possibilities.

80
00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:52.300
There's also the possibility that whatever photographs they took can get

81
00:04:52.301 --> 00:04:56.200
severely damaged in the radiation of space.
And it was really difficult to do.

82
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.880
Right.
That's possible too.
And that they,

83
00:04:58.881 --> 00:05:02.830
they decided somehow or another that they were going to pass off these,

84
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.760
that they actually did go and they decided they're going to pass off some of

85
00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:10.210
these fake videos.
So there's a bunch of possibilities.

86
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.770
The possibility that it looks fake because I'm dumb and because I don't

87
00:05:14.771 --> 00:05:18.160
understand anything about the physics of one six earth's gravity and it just

88
00:05:18.161 --> 00:05:22.510
looks weird because it's shitty film.
It's 1969 that's possibility number one.

89
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.670
Number two is they fake some things or number three is they,

90
00:05:26.671 --> 00:05:31.360
they didn't really have good footage because like you couldn't take film through

91
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.120
the airport.
Remember that?
Like people would go through those right.

92
00:05:34.121 --> 00:05:37.210
Radar detectors and you're filming get jacked and they wouldn't wear it

93
00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:39.950
responsibly.
You didn't have the film.
But I know people that might,
you know,

94
00:05:39.951 --> 00:05:43.030
I have friends that are photographers and um,

95
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.440
my uncle is a photographer and he would tell me,
you can't send the,
the film,

96
00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:50.640
like if you have like you've take a roll of film and the awesome picture didn't

97
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.440
get it through.
I don't know.
I don't know what the fuck they did,

98
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.310
but I know that some film has been damaged or maybe it's an urban myth.

99
00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.410
Maybe they would find out of film got damaged by a,

100
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:08.090
those radar things at the airport,
x rays,
x rays.

101
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.810
We could appreciate the mindset though of looking at your opinion objective,
Lee,

102
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.400
and saying,
am I tripping?
It's looking at the facts and say,

103
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.430
I'm just not really sure.
I think that's the problem with people today,

104
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.600
people in period is that they're afraid to say,
I don't know.
Yeah.

105
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.540
You know what I mean?
They're super afraid.
It's like,
to me,

106
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:27.860
ignorance is such a gift.

107
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.280
Like it just gives you an opportunity to learn some shit if you're humble
enough.

108
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:33.800
Like,
don't assume you know,
even though she had,
I felt like,

109
00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:36.560
I know I still feel like,
I don't know.
Yeah.
Well that seems,

110
00:06:36.561 --> 00:06:41.180
you have a very healthy ego for a big young fucking super athlete.

111
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.360
It's fucking,
that's fucking football man.
Like,
no,

112
00:06:44.361 --> 00:06:46.070
but I'm saying ego is very healthy.

113
00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:49.320
You have a really good way of looking at things.
I think that's,

114
00:06:49.321 --> 00:06:54.321
that's the right way to be mad at you can't be married to was to like ideas and

115
00:06:54.771 --> 00:06:58.190
opinions like that because they're not you.
But we think that they are,

116
00:06:58.191 --> 00:07:02.100
they're like an extension of us.
So we want to win these arguments.
Yeah.

117
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.600
We want to be right.
I think it gets real scary when you want to be right.

118
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.110
And then you're willing to ignore evidence that might show that you're wrong.

119
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:13.040
Right.
That's how I felt about myself.
And by the way,
if you wanted to,

120
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.530
if you wanted a conspiracy,
that's a good one.

121
00:07:15.531 --> 00:07:19.280
That seems like it might be possible.
The Moon landings,
one of the best ones,

122
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:24.610
and this is why it's so attractive between 1969 in 1973 he's still on the fence

123
00:07:26.841 --> 00:07:31.790
about this,
Huh?
No,
no.
I'm not at all.
I'm on the,
I don't know shit fence.

124
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.900
That's where I live.
All right,
but between that facts on this side,

125
00:07:35.901 --> 00:07:39.280
I'm with you though.
They sent,
I think it was seven missions.

126
00:07:39.281 --> 00:07:40.400
Six of them were successful.

127
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.960
The only one that wasn't successful as Apollo 13 right.

128
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.680
They sent these fucking people around the moon,

129
00:07:45.681 --> 00:07:49.100
250,000 plus miles out there and back,

130
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:54.170
but ever since then all they've been able to do is get people into near Earth

131
00:07:54.171 --> 00:07:56.720
orbit ever since then,
like the highest anyone's ever gone,

132
00:07:56.721 --> 00:07:58.010
I think it's 400 miles.

133
00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:03.280
So they went from 260,000 miles all the way to the moon and back to 400 miles.

134
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:08.240
Everything is like inside and they've never gone through the mat of Van Allen

135
00:08:08.241 --> 00:08:10.640
radiation belts.
It never got into deep space and return.

136
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:15.170
They haven't done that since 1960 1973 I thought and I could be wrong,

137
00:08:15.171 --> 00:08:18.620
but I thought it was because of like funding could be like,
cause you know,

138
00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:22.250
we know lacmas got funds.
Show me,
show me how that makes sense.

139
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.690
You don't want to fund space travel.

140
00:08:23.691 --> 00:08:27.740
You want to fund that fucking acrylic box or box and edited by the way.

141
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:32.420
That's perfect.
It is great.
I don't,

142
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.530
I don't think that I know whether or not we went to the moon,

143
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.310
but I'm telling you that if you wanted a juicy conspiracy I'm looking to get

144
00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:43.580
excited about,
I was looking into,
it's the best one to get excited about.

145
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:48.470
I lost all the data.
I see.
Cause like I see like,
you know,

146
00:08:48.471 --> 00:08:50.400
you go down to Youtube Wormhole,
you know,

147
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:55.510
you started watching Barry Sanders highlight and then I'm looking at JFK,

148
00:08:55.861 --> 00:09:00.310
me and Michael Jackson or some shit.
But like I,

149
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:05.500
I just don't see what the motive would be like what is the fucking mode like

150
00:09:05.561 --> 00:09:07.860
what Cold War.
Um,
first of all,

151
00:09:07.861 --> 00:09:10.860
we wanted to beat the Russians because we were in a race to see who can get to

152
00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:13.620
the,
to the moon.
And here's one of the things that we do know for a fact.

153
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:17.480
The Russians faked a bunch of shit.
They fixing bunch of footage.
Yeah.

154
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.630
Yuri Gagarin,
who was the first man in space,
they had a video,

155
00:09:21.631 --> 00:09:24.120
might be an expert on this man.
But there,
well,
I studied this,

156
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.920
I debated a guy who was a really nice guy,
but,
um,
Phil plait,

157
00:09:28.921 --> 00:09:33.320
who's a bat astronomer,
bad astronomer.com.
Okay.
And um,
he,

158
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.940
he was a lot of things he wasn't willing to admit though that were unfortunate

159
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.880
because maybe he could have convinced me more if he was,

160
00:09:38.881 --> 00:09:43.050
and one of the big ones was that Warner von Braun was a Nazi.
We,

161
00:09:43.051 --> 00:09:46.590
they hired a bunch of Nazis to,
to run the space program.

162
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:51.000
It was called operation paperclip and what operation paperclip was when they

163
00:09:51.001 --> 00:09:54.360
took a bunch of Nazi scientists and relocated them to the United States.

164
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.660
We lost some of them to Russia,
the Russia scooped up song of them.

165
00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:01.710
But when we ended the World War Two and Nazi Germany collapsed,

166
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:03.670
we went in and took the scientists,

167
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:08.850
will Wernher von Braun was the head of a rocket factory in,
in,

168
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.220
um,
in Berlin where these,

169
00:10:11.221 --> 00:10:16.221
to hang the five slowest Jews in front of the rocket factory for all the other

170
00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:21.450
workers to see Warner von Braun,
the Simon Wiesenthal Center said,

171
00:10:21.451 --> 00:10:25.170
if a von Braun was alive today,
he'd be punished for crimes against humanity.

172
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:28.330
This is news.
No,

173
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:32.820
Wernher von Braun was a straight up Nazi and this guy was not willing to admit

174
00:10:32.821 --> 00:10:35.950
that.
Right.
You know,
it's like,
well,
you know,
just because someone's in Germany.

175
00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.940
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
He was a Nazi.
He's,
you know,
he was a Nazi.

176
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:42.670
Were there any actually killed anybody?
Maybe he had to be a Nazi.
I mean,

177
00:10:42.671 --> 00:10:43.830
we're not saying that,
look,

178
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.850
if you're fucked and you're in this neighborhood and that it overcomes the

179
00:10:47.851 --> 00:10:49.680
entire neighborhood,
you want to keep your family alive.

180
00:10:49.681 --> 00:10:51.780
So you put that thing on your,
uh,
your jacket sleeve.

181
00:10:51.781 --> 00:10:55.230
You put that swastika on and you see high like everybody else.

182
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.230
Maybe you're not really a Nazi ideologically.

183
00:10:58.231 --> 00:11:00.840
Maybe you're not a Nazi in your heart.
Maybe just trying to stay alive.

184
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.440
That's entirely possible too.
But he was a Nazi.

185
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.390
He was a fucking Nazi,

186
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:10.980
and they had slaves that were running rocket factories in Berlin where they were

187
00:11:10.981 --> 00:11:15.100
figuring out how to make rockets.
I said,
Brandon,

188
00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:19.050
I gotta I gotta I need to,
yeah,
operation paperclip,

189
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.370
Cold War President Truman authorized operation paperclip in August of 1945 the

190
00:11:23.371 --> 00:11:27.880
US army had secretly admitted 88 German scientists and engineers to help a

191
00:11:27.881 --> 00:11:32.460
development of rocket technology,
including Wernher von Braun,
Arthur Rudolph,

192
00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:36.880
and her butt to struggled her Berkus,
her Bertus,

193
00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:40.950
Hugh Bertis,
we us.
That's a great name.
It's not a great name.
Bring that back.

194
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.920
Burn.
If you have a fucking stud.
Kid is like,

195
00:11:43.921 --> 00:11:48.000
when it's strongest man in the world.
His name is [inaudible] my son.

196
00:11:48.001 --> 00:11:52.230
Do you purchase?
Fuck that.
I was named after a Nazi.

197
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:53.680
So there,

198
00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.260
there was like something in the debate that guy was not willing to admit,

199
00:11:56.261 --> 00:12:00.370
which made me even more skeptical that he was right about the other stuff.

200
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:05.430
The other thing was that they like and moon rocks that they've collected from

201
00:12:06.281 --> 00:12:10.660
the moon if turned out to not really be moon rocks like a bunch of them for sure

202
00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:14.950
have been tested by scientists and they found that these Brock's or from another

203
00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:16.720
planet,
but there was,

204
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:21.880
there was a rock that they gave to whoever's the head of Holland and it was

205
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:25.180
personally given with a plaque by Neil Armstrong,

206
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:30.330
buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins and it turned out to be petrified wood moon rock

207
00:12:31.841 --> 00:12:35.350
given to Holland by Neil Armstrong and buzz Aldrin is fake.

208
00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:39.820
It's a moon rock given to the Dutch prime minister by the Apollo 11 astronauts

209
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:41.710
in 1969 turned out to be a fake.

210
00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:46.240
So they were giving people pieces of petrified wood say,
and this is for you.

211
00:12:46.241 --> 00:12:49.300
We went to the moon.
God bless America,

212
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:54.180
308,000 euros.
Now there's,

213
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:55.810
there's a bunch of possibilities.
Okay,

214
00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:59.650
let's just be honest about this because this story is from 2009 it's entirely

215
00:12:59.651 --> 00:13:03.520
possible that between 1969 that,
well this is,

216
00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:06.740
there's multiple sources.
That's the telegraph.
That's a legit news.

217
00:13:06.741 --> 00:13:08.920
You got to trace to source for sure.

218
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:12.970
But I'm saying is that it's entirely possible that someone stole that Moon Rock

219
00:13:12.971 --> 00:13:17.770
and replaced with that.
That's possible.
That's possible.
Or it's possible.

220
00:13:17.771 --> 00:13:21.280
They just had some fake rocks.
Here's the thing,

221
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:26.080
Bill Clinton had a fucking,
he had a quote in his book in one of his books,

222
00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.440
um,
I think his book is called my life.

223
00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:33.250
And he had a quote about the moon landing and a story about him having this

224
00:13:33.251 --> 00:13:37.540
conversation with a carpenter and at this carpenter said that he didn't believe

225
00:13:37.541 --> 00:13:39.130
the moon landing.
He goes,

226
00:13:39.131 --> 00:13:43.270
them television fellers they can make anything look real.
And he said,

227
00:13:43.271 --> 00:13:45.730
this is a quote and Bill Clinton's fucking book.
He said,

228
00:13:45.731 --> 00:13:50.340
back then I thought that guy was a quack,
but after our crank,
whenever,

229
00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.410
crazy person.
But after eight years in the White House,

230
00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:56.140
I was wondering if he wasn't ahead of his time.
Oh Wow.

231
00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:00.850
This is a guy that was the fucking president of the United States and he's

232
00:14:00.851 --> 00:14:05.500
talking specifically about an old carpenter telling him the moon landing was

233
00:14:05.501 --> 00:14:10.360
fake.
And then he says,
I wondered after eight years in the White House,

234
00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:15.550
if that guy wasn't ahead of his time,
causation,
correlation.
Yeah,

235
00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:20.200
no,
look,
look,
could be bullshit.
Yeah.
Could be bullshit.
100%.

236
00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.640
It could be just a good story.

237
00:14:21.641 --> 00:14:23.470
I think that's the thing about conspiracy theories.

238
00:14:23.471 --> 00:14:26.890
It's like they lead you on all these dead end Chase's Oh yeah.

239
00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.070
So the long answer of your question,
that's,

240
00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:32.500
that's where I stood on this whole moon landing thing.

241
00:14:32.501 --> 00:14:35.800
That's why I came around to thinking in a different way that was way too

242
00:14:35.801 --> 00:14:38.710
convinced that I was right.
Right.
I'm like,
I'm convinced I was right,

243
00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:43.300
but it's fucking real low levels of understanding of any of the science of this

244
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:48.010
stuff.
That's the problem is as a society,
we're so scientifically illiterate,

245
00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:49.620
you know,
and that,
that,

246
00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:54.240
that causes so much room for speculation and you're kind of,
um,

247
00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.460
you kind of a prisoner of,
of,
of,

248
00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:00.800
of people who are masters of their crafts,

249
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:04.160
you're kind of a prisoner to their quote unquote agenda.

250
00:15:04.161 --> 00:15:05.960
I don't want to put that that bad of a term on it,

251
00:15:05.961 --> 00:15:08.480
but you're kind of prisoner of that because we don't have,
we don't have any,
any,

252
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:09.800
any choice.

253
00:15:09.801 --> 00:15:14.720
But to take there a word for or to pursue it yourself.
Right.

254
00:15:14.721 --> 00:15:16.610
To learn about what they're talking about yourself,
you know,

255
00:15:16.611 --> 00:15:19.820
if they're right or not.
Yeah.
Well that's,
that's absolutely the case,
right.

256
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.160
Cause you know,
that's the case in almost everything else.

257
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.290
<v 2>Okay.</v>
