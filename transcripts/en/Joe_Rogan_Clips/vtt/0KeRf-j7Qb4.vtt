1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.030
I am very impressed with the skill of some of these,

2
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.800
I guess this is the print primitive hunting movement with spears and see that's,

3
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.270
I think you should,

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.510
I think you should be really careful about anything that you do that's not that

5
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:22.370
accurate.
That's that's an issue.
Yeah.
That's a giant issue at,

6
00:00:22.371 --> 00:00:24.630
but bowser extremely accurate.
Right,

7
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.900
and there's guys that can shoot a paper plate at 120 yards every single time.

8
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.220
They could shoot a little plate like that.
They'll,
they'll bet their life.

9
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.700
They could drop an Arrow into that at 120 yards every single time.

10
00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:40.620
You can get good at that.
You can get,

11
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.920
if you have good technique and a reasonable control of your emotions and your

12
00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:46.800
anxiety and sure in the heart,
in the heat of the moment,

13
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.170
you don't ever shoot anything in 120 yards though.

14
00:00:49.171 --> 00:00:51.540
You're shooting at things 30 yards,
40 yards,

15
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.400
and the degree of success is very high with skilled hunters.

16
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.970
If you,
they're ethical and they're shy,
they're shot decisions.

17
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.010
That primitive stuff is like,
why?
Why are you throwing spears?
Like,
what do you,

18
00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:05.521
what are you doing?

19
00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:08.760
You're trying to prove that you're better than people that use a bow and arrow.

20
00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:13.320
Like this is not an accurate or effective thing.
I mean,
it kind of is,

21
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.870
but you have to be like five yards,
10 yards.

22
00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:18.300
Like what do you gotta be 15 yards max?
Even then,

23
00:01:18.301 --> 00:01:21.840
I think part of the thrill of it for them is putting themselves in danger.

24
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.310
There's a little bit of that if you're shooting,
oh,
you're going after a bear.

25
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.290
Yeah.
Like I've seen some of these things filmed where the person looks like,

26
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:34.200
you know,
they're up in there,
I don't know what to call it,
their little Tristan,

27
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.093
Tristan.

28
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.410
And that doesn't look like they're putting a lot of risk.

29
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.860
But some of these people are clearly getting off on this is the primal hunt.

30
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.360
Right.
And this is,

31
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.590
they're going backwards into something where the animal could surprise them.

32
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.220
And what I,

33
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.870
what I wanted to do is I want it to reacquaint myself with,
you know,

34
00:01:57.871 --> 00:02:02.370
now that I can,
I can watch somebody actually in that moment,
um,

35
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.760
try to figure out what my ethics around hunting where and I thought that I had

36
00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:10.680
prepared myself and I just,
I thought when I,
when I saw you,
um,

37
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.700
find out where Joe is.
Um,
cause I have no question.

38
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.800
Knowing your ethics and how you think that you would have a very subtle

39
00:02:19.801 --> 00:02:24.190
perspective on all these different kinds of kills,
which sorts of animals.
Yeah.

40
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.980
If you get to spears,
yeah,
you're in a weird place.
Like,

41
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.940
like you say,
oh I only spear wild pigs.
We're trying to get rid of them anyway.

42
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.440
Okay,
well that's,

43
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.460
we're in a weird place where in a weird place because a ethically,

44
00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:42.540
I think you have two choices,
three choices.
You three choices are rifle,

45
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.960
which is number one ethically,
realistically,

46
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.150
because if you shoot something with a rifle,
you,
you can be really accurate,

47
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.380
like out to a hundred yards a hundred percent of the time.

48
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.980
Like unless it's crazy windy out or there's some weird conditions,

49
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.990
altitude can affect ballistics but not that much out to a hundred yards.

50
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.460
You're fucking deadly.
If you have a really good control,
squeezing the trigger,

51
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:13.690
you're not jerking everything and not panicking,
then Beau is second,

52
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.590
you know,
bow,
it requires way more practice.
Way,

53
00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:22.570
way more fine tuning of your motor skills,
but it's still possible.
Okay.

54
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.100
Then you have crossbow,
which is even more effective than a bow.
Faster,

55
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:28.620
more feet per second,

56
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.380
faster feet per second so that it travels at a flat line because it's going

57
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:35.410
quicker before it drops.
The ball drop at the same speed.
Right?

58
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.800
Bullets and arrows all drop at the same speed.

59
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.870
They just don't get get there at the same speed.
Okay,

60
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.070
so in the same amount of time,

61
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.100
like if I'm shooting something at a hundred yards with a bow I am aiming with,

62
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.480
with a site that is calculating for the fact that the Arrow is going to drop

63
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:57.481
significantly in the time that it takes if it's going 280 feet per second is

64
00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:00.970
like a normal speed for a good bow.

65
00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:05.440
The good heavy Arrow that's 280 feet per second,
that goes a hundred yards.
Okay?

66
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.430
A bullet is going to go 100 yards far quicker,

67
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.180
but in the same amount of time it takes that Arrow to get to that target.

68
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.270
The bullet is going to drop the same amount as the Arrow and that's what most

69
00:04:16.271 --> 00:04:17.170
people don't understand.

70
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:22.690
So a crossbow is more ethical because it's more accurate.

71
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.030
It's this have fewer moving parts.

72
00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:28.780
You could accurately sit it on a rest and just squeeze the trigger easier to

73
00:04:28.781 --> 00:04:31.690
manipulate and the,
the Arrow is traveling faster,

74
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:33.820
so it's called a bolt traveling faster.

75
00:04:33.821 --> 00:04:38.821
Sotal drop less after that chick gets squirrely after that,

76
00:04:39.371 --> 00:04:43.180
it's like you're throwing spears.
Okay,
you got,
what do you got?
An Ad Ladol okay.

77
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.900
All right,
well you can kill things with it and people have done it,

78
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.900
but it gets to how accurate are you and what is,
what's your ethical brain?

79
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.180
Right?

80
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.300
Like an ethical ranch for a really good hunter with a bow and arrow is probably

81
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.980
80 yards.
You get me a bed,
maybe it's a moose 90 yards,
something big.

82
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.540
But with a spear,
like what do you got?
You got 10 yards.

83
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.670
So you know why that's the question.
Are you doing it for meat?

84
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.880
Are you doing it because,
um,
is this your Mount Everest?

85
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.500
You want to kill a pig with a spear and are you saying that as pig is not worth

86
00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:20.710
as much?
So you should be able to kill it with a spear cause these are all weird.

87
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.820
These are all weird decisions that were decisions and people make those with

88
00:05:24.821 --> 00:05:27.280
bears.
They make those decisions with black bears,

89
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.050
like people that live where they consider them nuisances.
Th they,
they kill them.

90
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.190
I mean they used to be,
you still allow them to shoot.
Uh,

91
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.520
you still allowed to hunt,

92
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.650
used to be allowed to hunt black bears with a spear in Alberta until a big

93
00:05:41.651 --> 00:05:45.340
scandal a couple of years ago where a guy filmed

94
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.910
self doing that.
He shot a bear,

95
00:05:48.911 --> 00:05:53.470
he killed a bear or rather with spear and was hooting and hollering and people

96
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.550
got ahold of the video and thought it was disgusting and protested it.
And,
uh,

97
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.603
people,
uh,

98
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.420
from underarmour dropped his a wife from there,
you know,

99
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.270
they had this sort of a sponsorship deal with them and uh,
it,
it,

100
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.390
it ignited,
it caused a rift in the hunting community.

101
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.220
Some people think you should be able to hunt with a rock.

102
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.370
I don't care what you hunt with Sheila Hunt with anything and other people like,

103
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.130
hmm,
okay,
but what are we doing?

104
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.160
Are we just going out to get meat or are we putting on a macho performance of

105
00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:25.604
our [inaudible]?

106
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.550
<v 1>This is exactly what I wanted to get at.</v>

107
00:06:27.551 --> 00:06:32.020
Which is if you know that the population has to be controlled and you want the

108
00:06:32.021 --> 00:06:33.060
meat,
yeah.

109
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.850
Then it makes sense to me that you have to open yourself up to some of the

110
00:06:36.851 --> 00:06:39.070
pleasure of the kill.
That makes some sense.

111
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:44.060
But what I saw just like flipped me out because it wasn't,
it was,

112
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.030
it was above and beyond.
Yeah.
I saw a spear and yeah,

113
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:51.010
and other things and you know,
I was impressed by the,
some of the skill,

114
00:06:51.011 --> 00:06:54.930
I'm impressed by some of the bravery,
but like why,
right,
right.

115
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.160
And doing it to populate your control,
you're doing it for the,

116
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.380
this was a surprise to me.
I got kind of sickened by it.

117
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.880
<v 0>Surprising.
It's not surprising,
you know?
I mean I think if you,</v>

118
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.640
if you were there,

119
00:07:09.641 --> 00:07:12.970
you'd probably be even more conflicted because you actually were there and the

120
00:07:12.971 --> 00:07:14.980
presence of the thing dying,
you know,

121
00:07:14.981 --> 00:07:18.400
watching a bare die on a a video is one thing.

122
00:07:18.401 --> 00:07:22.420
But being there alive when they die as a completely different thing,
um,

123
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.570
it's,
it's,

124
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:30.070
it's a very complicated thing because we have these deep set

125
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.280
emotional connections to certain animals that my friend Steve Rinella,

126
00:07:36.281 --> 00:07:39.290
who's going to be actually on tomorrow,
he calls them,
um,

127
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:44.310
charismatic megafauna that we have this different view of certain animals bears

128
00:07:44.441 --> 00:07:48.040
in particular.
But if you use the animal respectfully,

129
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.640
respectfully,
and you kill it ethically and you do,

130
00:07:51.641 --> 00:07:55.310
I don't have any problem with hunting bears.
In fact,
I think it's actually an,

131
00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.340
and that's it.
It really is a necessary task.
It.

132
00:07:58.341 --> 00:08:01.480
It's something that even if you don't like to hunt bears,

133
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:03.790
if you're living in a place like Alberta,

134
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.640
you probably should hunt bears because you should do your part.

135
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.960
There's a lot of them out there and you know,
one of the things that becomes,
uh,

136
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.680
an interesting relationships or relationship between the moose hunters and the

137
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.350
deer hunters and the bear hunters that they have.

138
00:08:17.351 --> 00:08:22.300
Kind of those smart ones have come to an understanding that even if I don't hunt

139
00:08:22.301 --> 00:08:24.530
bear,
I need those people out there doing it.
Okay,

140
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.720
but it's how do you do it and why you doing it?

141
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:32.050
I think I've seen animals die very quickly with a bone arrow.

142
00:08:32.051 --> 00:08:35.050
They die very quickly.
I've never seen animal die with a spear.

143
00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:36.670
I don't think it's necessary,

144
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.910
but I don't want to be the person that tells you you can't do it.

145
00:08:39.911 --> 00:08:44.911
If you have an ethical range of five yards and you only hunt bear with a spear

146
00:08:45.161 --> 00:08:49.660
at five yards and you kill it immediately,
you hit it and kill it.
You're right.

147
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:50.733
Then you're right.

148
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.680
<v 1>It's not based on the method.
It's based on what,</v>

149
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.550
what are the ethical around the time I appreciate it.

150
00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:01.100
<v 0>So I would kind of be a hypocrite because even though I can ethically kill</v>

151
00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.160
something at 40 yards or just figuring out what the number is,

152
00:09:04.161 --> 00:09:08.420
depending on the size of the animal,
right.
Um,
even though I can do that,

153
00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:11.540
I could do it way easier with a rifle.
So why am I using a bow and Arrow?

154
00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:15.200
Why do I want to make it more difficult?
Why am I making it more challenging?

155
00:09:15.201 --> 00:09:20.000
Why am I requiring myself to practice more questions?
You're very self aware.

156
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.900
It's a very important question to ask because if I was just doing it just for

157
00:09:23.901 --> 00:09:24.734
the meat,

158
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.790
<v 1>I would probably use a rifle,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think that that,
that,</v>

159
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.280
that part of it has to do with the primal association with the kill.

160
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.860
And then the key question is how do you want to indulge that?

161
00:09:34.861 --> 00:09:37.800
What is the set and setting,
blah,
blah,
blah.
So that was the,

162
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:41.430
that was the thing that I found shocking.
This is that I had thought,
you know,

163
00:09:41.431 --> 00:09:44.580
I understood something about the need to control population.

164
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:49.710
It's the effect which really killed me.
Well again,
we're talking about bears,

165
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:54.660
you know,
it's not just bears other animals as well.
Yeah.
I mean I saw,

166
00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.090
I don't want to focus more on it necessarily,

167
00:10:00.091 --> 00:10:02.730
but it's just a question I had to ask you because I sort of,

168
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.830
I was very surprised by my own reaction.
Well,
a lot of it

169
00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:08.950
<v 0>people are taking issue.
My good friend Ben O'brien,</v>

170
00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:13.500
who's a brilliant writer who's actually also a hunter,
um,

171
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.231
is uh,

172
00:10:14.231 --> 00:10:18.610
advocating that people stop taking what he calls grip and grins with a grip.

173
00:10:18.611 --> 00:10:20.590
And Grin is like,
say if you shot a beautiful deer,

174
00:10:20.591 --> 00:10:24.490
you're holding the deer up by the antlers and you're smiling and he's advocating

175
00:10:24.491 --> 00:10:28.420
that those photos are problematic because people who don't hunt look at it like

176
00:10:28.421 --> 00:10:31.930
you're some bloodthirsty asshole that's super happy that something died.

177
00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.700
And that's not,

178
00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:38.710
even though that's not how the people feel when they're taking those photos,

179
00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:42.490
what there are is happy that something which is very difficult,
which you know,

180
00:10:42.491 --> 00:10:45.730
especially if we're using a bow,
most people go home empty handed.

181
00:10:45.731 --> 00:10:47.800
It's requires too much fitness,

182
00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.740
physical fitness because you're going up and down these mountains.

183
00:10:50.741 --> 00:10:55.170
It requires too much accuracy and training and technique and archery.

184
00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:57.430
Most people fuck it up and then there's dealing with anxiety.

185
00:10:57.431 --> 00:11:01.810
Most people fuck it up.
But after it's all over,

186
00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:05.350
there's this great feeling of elation.
Right?
You did it.

187
00:11:05.351 --> 00:11:07.060
I can't believe it came together.
Wow.

188
00:11:07.061 --> 00:11:09.790
Cause it was probably not going to come together and people get happy.

189
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.820
And these are people again that already except hunting.

190
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.480
Now if you take someone who is an animal rights activist or someone who deeply

191
00:11:16.481 --> 00:11:18.550
appreciates animals and then you show him that photo,

192
00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:22.180
they have a completely different association with what that photo means would

193
00:11:22.181 --> 00:11:25.330
that photo means is,
here's an asshole who's a trophy hunt.

194
00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.950
<v 1>Okay.
The shots.
Let me get my thing.</v>

195
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:32.960
I don't know any species that celebrates a kill for food with glee chips.

196
00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:41.120
Do Choda.
Sorry.
Sorry.
You're right.
Yeah.
When they kill a monkey,

197
00:11:41.121 --> 00:11:45.500
they get pretty happy.
Well then they do it socially,
and then they share it,
uh,

198
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:48.570
you know,
through altruism,
and he's screaming each other.
Yeah.
Yay.

199
00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.620
So that's the chimps are my least favorite species,

200
00:11:51.621 --> 00:11:55.400
almost of all their wholesale.
Terrifying.
Worse.
Yeah.

201
00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:56.990
They're terrifying little fuckers.
