WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.390
That was,
it was,
uh,
again,
anybody get a chance to go see,

2
00:00:03.391 --> 00:00:06.720
go see a show because this one was my Netflix.

3
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.920
You can see that thing now.
You got to pay more for Netflix now.
Yeah.

4
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:14.690
What is it like 10 bucks?
Yeah,
17% more.
I think they're going to charge.
They can

5
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.390
so much good shit though.

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.310
Like if you want to just waste your life and sit in front of the TV,
it's crazy.

7
00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:25.710
Like when we were kids,
maybe that's your passion.

8
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.270
So you get that universal basic income.

9
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:31.400
And my following my passion means I got to sit and watch every episode of Andy

10
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.280
Griffith Fart under the sheets.
And there's a lot of people doing that right now.

11
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.730
I don't know if that's bad is,
I mean yes it is,

12
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:42.720
but then doesn't that open the door for the people that aren't going to be like

13
00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:46.560
that?
Like look,
less people out there really actually trying to get ahead.

14
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.890
I think the people that are going to try to succeed are always going to try to

15
00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:52.050
succeed.
I think that's true.
And I think so.
I think that's,

16
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.650
maybe that's an argument against it also,
which has said like,

17
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.610
I don't think it's going to unlock a whole treasure trove of innovators,

18
00:00:59.611 --> 00:01:03.780
right.
If suddenly you give people money and say,
okay,

19
00:01:03.781 --> 00:01:08.670
you don't have to go pour coffee or,
or flip burgers or you know,

20
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.220
clean up that road or whatever you're gonna do for a living,

21
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.990
you can follow your passion.

22
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.230
I don't think we're going to find some exponential increase in the number of

23
00:01:16.231 --> 00:01:17.550
people inventing the wheel.

24
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.940
I just think that it's just going to be a lot more people farden under the

25
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.310
blankets or something.
I don't know.
They might be right,

26
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.450
but the only good that I think could come out of it as a less people are an

27
00:01:27.451 --> 00:01:32.280
abject poverty and less people were desperate.
So it might reduce crime.

28
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.380
You might have lazy people,

29
00:01:34.381 --> 00:01:39.000
but you might also have less people that are inclined to steal things or do

30
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:42.430
something that's illegal because their basic needs are taken care of.
Yeah.

31
00:01:42.431 --> 00:01:45.480
So that's a valid point.
I read something that's,
it stunned me.
It was,

32
00:01:45.481 --> 00:01:48.880
it was on a plane flying to la,
to La.
Um,

33
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.490
and I read an article about this,
the strike,
right?
The teachers,
sorry,

34
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.890
that here in Los Angeles,
big strike,

35
00:01:55.891 --> 00:02:00.030
Los Angeles Unified School Authority or whatever it's called.

36
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.500
And it was just before they,
they went on strike,

37
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.430
but it talked about the problems at the school district has,

38
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.350
and I don't know whether this statistic is right.

39
00:02:10.351 --> 00:02:15.000
I read it numerous times because I was so surprised by it.
80% of the,

40
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.133
uh,

41
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.140
families that used the Los Angeles public school system are at the poverty level

42
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.970
or below.
And that means of course,

43
00:02:26.971 --> 00:02:31.110
also that they rely on the free meal assistance,
right.
That the schools provide,

44
00:02:31.111 --> 00:02:33.000
which is kind of what,
what the point of the story was.
Like,

45
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:35.280
the schools are closed right now.
And so,
you know,

46
00:02:35.281 --> 00:02:36.690
kids aren't getting a chance to eat because they,

47
00:02:36.691 --> 00:02:40.710
that's their only chance to get to eat.
Right.
But that number was stunning.

48
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.230
That's crazy.
Right?
So I don't,
I,

49
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.870
I meant to look into it and do more research to see whether the article is

50
00:02:45.871 --> 00:02:48.990
actually correct or not,
but hey,
it was in the newspaper,
so it must be true.

51
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.040
Right.
I don't know about that.
Anyway.
Uh,
yeah,

52
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.680
he's a disturbing number.
It's a very disturbing number.

53
00:02:55.681 --> 00:02:58.320
But it also talked about how 12%,

54
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.350
I think 12 of all kids that go to high school here in Los Angeles then go on to

55
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:07.480
college,
12%.
And uh,

56
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.660
it was a similar number that never get out of high school.

57
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.210
And it's even worse than a place like New York City public schools.

58
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.540
So I guess the point being is a public school system is it's dark.
Yeah.
In,
in,

59
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.900
in the larger urban centers,
it's got some real problems.

60
00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:22.660
And I think a lot of those people that are the really sad things,

61
00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:26.140
a lot of those people that are at the poverty line or below work hard,

62
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.650
it's not a lack of motivation and said,
just don't have opportunities.

63
00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:32.440
You don't know what to do.
That not doing it the right way.

64
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:35.980
They don't have guidance.
They never learned correctly when they were young.

65
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.880
Maybe single parent,
they've,
what's the two or three jobs and,
no,
but,
but look,

66
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.200
California has got all sorts of interesting issues.
I mean there's uh,
you know,

67
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.900
talking to some folks and they said,
uh,

68
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.920
a quarter of the nation's homeless people live here in California.

69
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.730
25% of the nation's homeless people live in California and a place to live.
Yeah.

70
00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.990
Well,
I mean,
yeah,
I mean these rain in the last few days,

71
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.780
most of the time it's beautiful weather.
Hey,

72
00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:04.900
can't complain about the weather anyway,
but it is crazy.
And,

73
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.110
and it also talks about how a lot of those people,
they work,

74
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.600
but they're homeless,
right?
The cost of housing.

75
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.900
And so you've got people that have a job,
but they are living in their cars,

76
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.900
right?
Because they can't afford housing,

77
00:04:16.901 --> 00:04:21.300
whether it's in San Francisco or Los Angeles.
Insanity.
Yeah.
That is,

78
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.670
that place is insanity.
So your point about the basic universal income,

79
00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:28.180
I take that point,
I see what that,
you know,

80
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.280
if it was possible to pay for it and uh,
and again,

81
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.370
kind of do this thing where you'd,

82
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.680
you're monitoring this issue of motivation so you're not creating another follow

83
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:42.430
on generation,
just complete slack acids.
Then I think that's it.

84
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.140
That's a really valid point.
I,

85
00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:48.340
my concern would be people that didn't appreciate it and people that felt

86
00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:52.570
entitled,
like they felt like someone owed them that money.
Now you know,

87
00:04:52.571 --> 00:04:54.340
and you're going to have that.
I mean,
this is the,

88
00:04:54.341 --> 00:04:57.070
this is the biggest problem that people have with socialism and socialist

89
00:04:57.071 --> 00:04:59.350
attitudes that some of these kids that are coming up right now,

90
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.410
they look at what they call income inequality,

91
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.440
what they don't look at his effort inequality.

92
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.830
Like some people put in more fucking work and are smarter.

93
00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:15.010
They've figured their way through the game better than you have been doing it

94
00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:17.050
for 50 years or whatever they brain,
right?

95
00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:20.250
It's not that I couldn't agree with him more in the sense that I,

96
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.470
I never begrudged anybody.

97
00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:27.010
I never got pissed off with a rich person because they were rich.
Right.

98
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.880
I think it,
hey,
that's good.
I'd like to be rich.
Right,
right.

99
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.520
So I might want to talk and find out,
hey,
how'd you do it?
How'd you do it?

100
00:05:33.521 --> 00:05:35.410
And yeah,
it's a system sometimes,
you know,

101
00:05:35.411 --> 00:05:38.560
set up so that once you have some money,
you can get more money.

102
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.530
Well of course the fuck it is.
Yeah.
I mean,
I,
if I have some money,

103
00:05:41.531 --> 00:05:44.440
I can invest that money and make more money if I'm smart about it,

104
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:47.670
if I do it right,
if you do it right.
But I absolutely,
I don't,
you know,

105
00:05:47.671 --> 00:05:49.060
I don't begrudge the idea that's,

106
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.440
so that's part of it is also fairly steeped in the idea that,
you know,

107
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.830
we're living in a very unique country.
Right.

108
00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.210
And I do worry sometimes that,
uh,
people don't,
you know,

109
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.260
I,
you know,

110
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.710
even family and I've got some friends and others who just constantly pissing and

111
00:06:06.711 --> 00:06:08.900
moaning about this place.
And I'm thinking,

112
00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:13.250
I spent almost all my life over and shit holes around the world and I,

113
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.670
there is no other place I would rather be as a country.
And I know that's,

114
00:06:16.671 --> 00:06:20.870
you know,
it's jingoistic or whatever.
But,
uh,
honest to God,
I still believe,

115
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:24.080
and if you go someplace and you talk to somebody in,
in some fifth world,

116
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.150
they will also have,
my experience has been any way,
uh,

117
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.500
maybe you're listening in your experience is different,

118
00:06:30.501 --> 00:06:34.580
but that's the way it works,
uh,
is that they'll think if I go to America,

119
00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:38.900
if I can get to America and I work hard,
I can,
I can be successful.

120
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.880
And that I think is still true.

121
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.050
And that's what I worry about with entitlements and thinks that that may kill

122
00:06:45.051 --> 00:06:48.770
that belief.
And you're right.
Incoming inequality.
Yeah,
that's,

123
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.520
but it's your right,
you work harder now.
It doesn't always happen,

124
00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:54.050
but life's not supposed to be fair.
It's,
well,
it's,

125
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.320
maybe it's supposed to be fair,
but it's not fair.
So sorry.

126
00:06:57.321 --> 00:07:02.230
If it's just supposed to be life,
it's definitely not fair.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's,
uh,
I,

127
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.480
I completely see your point and I,
and I agree with it.

128
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.430
I think that the real concern is that people don't appreciate already how great

129
00:07:10.431 --> 00:07:13.010
they have and what incredible opportunity to have.

130
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:18.340
And if we increase w w w we give them more benefits with less effort than you're

131
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:21.350
going to develop more of this attitude that we find disturbing,

132
00:07:21.351 --> 00:07:25.760
which is people that don't have an appreciation for literally the greatest

133
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.200
experiment in self government.
The world's ever known.
Yeah,
yeah.
No,
I,
I,
eh,

134
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.270
but I think also that there's,
there's parts of it that need to be looked at.

135
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:39.020
Like there's a,
there's an interesting study about,
uh,
uh,
about college and,
uh,

136
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.510
graduation rates from college for,
uh,
for,
uh,

137
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.000
disadvantaged folks.
You know,
and that was again,

138
00:07:47.001 --> 00:07:50.330
why they made it easier for tuition assistance,
right?

139
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:55.190
So the idea was we want to expand the college ability for everybody,

140
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.280
which is a great idea,
right?
But what they found was they expanded the,
the,
the,

141
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:03.770
the,
the college opportunity for everybody.
But over the past decade,

142
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:08.200
decade and a half,
fewer people from the lower income,
uh,

143
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.220
uh,
categories have been graduating.
Right?
So you've,
what you've done is you said,

144
00:08:13.221 --> 00:08:17.510
come on in.
It's like,
you know,
it's like a special operators,
right?
If,
if,

145
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.210
if you lower the bar,
right?
Right.
Um,

146
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.250
and this is where I'm going to get in trouble.

147
00:08:22.251 --> 00:08:24.230
Probably I'll talk about the marines and you know,

148
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.540
allowing women into combat elements.
I know,
oh my God,
well what do they do?

149
00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.370
You lower the bar [inaudible] you make it.
Okay,

150
00:08:31.371 --> 00:08:33.620
well not enough of them could get through the course.

151
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.450
So I'm going to change the regulations.
And so if you change the regulations,

152
00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:40.280
what they found,
where the college was,
if you,

153
00:08:40.281 --> 00:08:42.590
if you increase that pool of people going,

154
00:08:42.591 --> 00:08:45.170
it doesn't mean that they're going to be successful.
Right.

155
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.170
And now what you've done is you've kind of saddle them with some college debt

156
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.020
and they didn't graduate.
So they're still earning what a high school,
you know,

157
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.130
graduate earns and,
and the,
the system doesn't work.

158
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.790
And so I think sometimes just the idea throwing money at the problem or,
or,

159
00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.600
or it doesn't,

160
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:05.040
it's not helpful if we don't think it through and then assess the results.
So,

161
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.580
but yeah,
that,
that,
that whole marine experiment,
I think they're,

162
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.830
they're catching it late in the chain.

163
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:15.690
And I think it's good to give people the opportunity to succeed into advance

164
00:09:15.691 --> 00:09:19.620
themselves.
But if you really want to address it as a systemic problem,

165
00:09:19.621 --> 00:09:21.060
you got to get to the root of it,

166
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:25.100
which is these unbelievably horrible neighborhoods.
And these,

167
00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:29.070
these toxic environments that these kids are growing up and being abused and

168
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:34.080
being scared and bullied and terrible piss poor education,
you know,

169
00:09:34.081 --> 00:09:38.790
first through all the way up to high school.
That's,
I mean,

170
00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:40.630
that's really where you have to address it.
I mean,

171
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:44.010
addressing adjusted at the college level and giving them the opportunity to get

172
00:09:44.011 --> 00:09:45.780
into college and making it easier for them.

173
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:51.210
It doesn't negate the terrible foundation that's been laid by their life.

174
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.030
But yeah,
and I think that's,
we,

175
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:56.310
we had this idea that that college should be for everybody.
Right.

176
00:09:56.311 --> 00:09:58.730
And that's okay.
That's great.
And that's,
I think that's where the,
you know,

177
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:03.240
people like Cortez and Bernie Sanders and others with their idea of free
tuition.

178
00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.720
Yes.
You know,
they're thinking,
okay,
wow,
look at Europe.
You know,

179
00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.600
there's some countries in Europe have free tuition and hey,
it's,
you know,

180
00:10:09.601 --> 00:10:12.180
it's relatively prosperous and there's nothing wrong with that.

181
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.890
But at the same time,
you know,
I,
I think we,
we don't,

182
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:22.320
we,
we don't assess the cost and the overall efficiency of an idea sometimes.

183
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:27.330
And so we just assume and you know,
open it up,
let everybody go,

184
00:10:27.331 --> 00:10:29.820
and somehow this is going to work right.
To our advantage.

185
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.630
And honest to God answer is no.
You know,

186
00:10:33.631 --> 00:10:37.140
I think somebody is better off sometimes,
you know,
go into,
you know,

187
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.680
becoming a plumber,
maybe,
maybe an honorable living,

188
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.230
living to create living.

189
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:48.210
One of the happiest guys I know is my plumber in Boise.
That guy is,
I mean,

190
00:10:48.211 --> 00:10:52.260
he's got it knocked right.
He's always out for hunting season and you know,

191
00:10:52.261 --> 00:10:56.350
he'll call,
I'll say,
look,
I got a,
I got a lake,
right?
My ceilings about the cave.

192
00:10:56.351 --> 00:11:00.450
And he goes,
well,
I'm going hunting.
And sorry,
he's just got,

193
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.950
he's got his own schedule.
