1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.920
Have any thoughts at all once you'd finally retired?
Like maybe one more.

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.820
Did you ever have any thoughts like that?
Well,
you know,
um,

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.110
I told people like I'll take,
I'll take my pajamas off for a hundred mil.
Mm.

4
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.210
So
she serious come with the baby,
show me the paper.

5
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.100
But who would have to be against a j maybe no meals,

6
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.700
no snacking and enticing.
But when you had beat and Tyson,

7
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.660
you'd beat Tyson.
That was kind of at the end of his stage two.
Right.

8
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.750
It wasn't the same guy.
Like I've,
I,
I looked at Tyson's history,
you know,

9
00:00:35.751 --> 00:00:38.550
it's coming from the same history that I'm coming from,
you know,

10
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.560
and he spent some time in incarceration while he was incarceration.

11
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:46.530
I'm still out there fighting and training hard.

12
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.180
He didn't have that in there.
So when,
when he came out,
it's like,
you know,

13
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.520
he's trained again.
He's doing what he,
what he knows not what he loves,

14
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.670
what he knows.

15
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.140
That's what's going to make him some money that's going to put food on this

16
00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:01.471
table.

17
00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:06.090
So it's like I look at old time fighters and say what made them stay in boxing

18
00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:10.920
so long?
That's the only thing they knew,
right.
They didn't,
they,

19
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.350
they're not going to be no singer or dance or whatever.

20
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.740
They only know boxing and this is where they get their money from.
So they,

21
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.140
that's what,
that's what forces and back into the ring,

22
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.070
especially especially olden days.

23
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.570
And that's why they were called prize fighters because they wouldn't make enough

24
00:01:23.571 --> 00:01:26.360
money to,
to make a living unless you were like a huge,

25
00:01:26.361 --> 00:01:31.040
I get Jack Dempsey or ray robins,
ray Robinson fought way,
way,

26
00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:32.130
way past its prime.

27
00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:35.300
It again cause they were making good money at the time but not the money that

28
00:01:35.301 --> 00:01:37.400
they would have been making if it was today.
Well there was no,

29
00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:41.300
I mean you had to go see it live,
you know like how much yeah,

30
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.810
we'll get paid for the radio.
Who Was it?
Was that fight on the radio?

31
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.500
Was it Jack Dempsey?
Gene tiny.
That was the first million dollar gate.
I think.

32
00:01:48.501 --> 00:01:51.170
So one of those,
Ray Arcel did that fight I think.

33
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.510
And that create what does $1 million back then?

34
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.970
It sets a lot of money back then it was in the 1920s,
right?
Yeah.

35
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.700
Just say Jack Gene Tunney Jack Gene.
This gene Tunney.
Yeah.
Um,

36
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.310
when,
when Tyson was in jail,

37
00:02:04.311 --> 00:02:08.570
he must've been doing something cause he came out jacked.
Like he looked good.

38
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.610
Like he came out looking different than he ever looked like six pack fully built

39
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.850
when he fought Peter McNeely.
Terrifying.

40
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.010
But like physically he looked really good too.

41
00:02:19.011 --> 00:02:22.190
Like you look better than he ever looked.
More ripped than ever.

42
00:02:22.191 --> 00:02:26.510
So when he went in he was a little chubby.
Yeah.
You know,
what is it doing there?

43
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.840
Yes.
Nothing else.
That's weights.
Fuck dudes.
That's why here,
you know

44
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.850
how many dudes before it's enough.
That's how much time you're in there for it.

45
00:02:37.851 --> 00:02:40.100
Yeah.
That was him when he came out.
Yeah.

46
00:02:40.101 --> 00:02:44.870
He was shredded it and it was so much more muscular.
So he's probably,

47
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.510
he probably couldn't do any sparring.
I doubt they had a heavy bag,

48
00:02:47.511 --> 00:02:50.330
but they probably had a weight room,
you know,
but you can fight,

49
00:02:50.331 --> 00:02:54.140
you can fight in prison.
And he was like 28,
29 there.
It depends on what prison,

50
00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:58.700
right?
Yeah.
No,
I'm saying even fight,
just fight.
Fight people.
Yeah,
yeah,

51
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.420
yeah.
You know what,
somebody would have tried to start some shit with,

52
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.180
oh I'm sure.
I'm sure we're not on guard even,
you know.
Yeah,
I bet.

53
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:09.980
I bet he had to listen to a lot of shitty things regarding,

54
00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.130
it's funny when I seen him be arrested,

55
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:15.070
taken from the courtroom and they got,

56
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.120
they must've got the biggest guy they could ever get to go put handcuffs on him

57
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:23.680
or something like that.
Um,
anyway,
situation that.

58
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.620
Yeah.
I hope a lot of people stay away from,
yeah.

59
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.870
When he went away did you feel like,
dammit,

60
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.010
like I'm going to miss out on that fight that I want it.
Yes.
Straight away.

61
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.660
And he's like,
oh no,
I'm going to have to wait and delay my retirement.

62
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.010
Oh,
so you were waiting,

63
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.270
you were considering retirement even before he was incarcerated?
Yeah.
Wow.

64
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.470
Interesting.
Cause then you were chasing the bull fight.
Both fights,
chicken bowl,

65
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.920
you know,
you figured that,
um,
chicken bowl.

66
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.570
So she couldn't call them ridiculous bro.
Ridiculous book.

67
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.050
She can go try to pick a fight with me the other day did,

68
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.840
didn't really do the other day.
He did.
Yeah.
Where,
um,
other fights,

69
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.650
like in la where they called all the great ones on Gerry Cooney,
me,

70
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.890
uh,
foreman Spinks was there.
And what was he doing?

71
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.350
He wanted to stand beside me and take a picture.
I'm like,
dude,

72
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:20.950
you can't stand beside me.
Costs down where I want.
Understand.
I'm like,
dude,

73
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.933
you're going to have to move.

74
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.190
So Gerry Cooney kind of helped us out there while I'm saved him

75
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:29.260
because he.
