Hello Freak bitches.
That's an abused word.
Love.

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.750
This is way too many people throwing that word around like a beach ball at a

3
00:00:07.751 --> 00:00:08.750
concert.
It's just too

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.990
<v 1>Butte,
all of that shit.</v>

5
00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:13.290
And then like all of that stuff that people say that when you first see your kid

6
00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:16.350
off,
like they,
they fill your head up on what the fuck you supposed to feel.

7
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.960
I was talking about this on a,
I think on Kimmel,

8
00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:24.150
like I w I saw my kid for the first time.
I was like afraid.
Like I was like,

9
00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:27.600
I didn't have that.
Ooh,
good and start crying.
I was just like,
hey.

10
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:30.210
And I sorta just put my finger down,
let it,
they like hold.

11
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.470
And when they left me alone with the first time,

12
00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:37.560
like the magnitude of it was,
was,
was definitely huge.

13
00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:42.510
But I didn't feel that whole like,
you know,
the second icon saw my kid.

14
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.990
I knew my life had changed,
but I didn't feel that for like 12 hours.

15
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.460
It wasn't until the next,

16
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.400
but I think here's my head was so filled up on what I was supposed,

17
00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:53.650
I was like having an outer body experience and it wasn't until,
you know,

18
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.860
the next morning and my wife was playing like Stevie wonder,

19
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.791
you know what I mean?

20
00:00:56.791 --> 00:00:59.670
Some chill music and stuff and I was just sitting with their and it just sort
of,

21
00:00:59.671 --> 00:01:02.430
you know,
and you know,
baby baby sneezes or something like that,
you just,

22
00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:04.240
and it just fucking hits you.
Um,

23
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.260
but even then I never had like that blubbering moment.

24
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.250
<v 0>To me it was kind of scary too and,</v>

25
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.230
and kind of psychedelic because when,
uh,

26
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.650
when my daughter was born,
my eight year old is born.

27
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.250
There was a moment when I was thinking how many babies are being born

28
00:01:21.251 --> 00:01:24.100
simultaneously right now all over the world.

29
00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:28.390
And if you could look at it on a screen,
it would be a swarm of humanity.
Just,

30
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.940
just heads popping out of pussies is
just,

31
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.040
if you could see every baby coming out right now.
And then,

32
00:01:36.041 --> 00:01:40.270
and then I thought at the same time I thought about this baby becoming an old

33
00:01:40.271 --> 00:01:41.980
lady and dying.
And I thought like,

34
00:01:41.981 --> 00:01:44.410
how many old people are dying simultaneous at the same yeah.

35
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.030
<v 1>Time right now.
Yeah.
See I think it's because everybody,</v>

36
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.920
the hacky thing is you're supposed to say the second I saw my kid,

37
00:01:51.921 --> 00:01:54.860
I bursted out crying and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

38
00:01:54.861 --> 00:01:57.470
And then so then it becomes like,
if you don't do that,

39
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.890
you're not going to be a good dad.
You don't care.
And all of that type of stuff.

40
00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:04.340
But I,
I just think that that kind of became like that the hackey um,

41
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.720
default thing.
And then I also,
this is all just theories of course,

42
00:02:08.721 --> 00:02:11.330
and I'm not going to research any of this,
but,
um,

43
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.140
I think parents try to outdo each other with their stories about what the fuck

44
00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:17.660
they felt.
And he's just become like,
they're really,
they're really like,

45
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.850
they're not saying people.
Most parents,

46
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.140
and I've learned to kind of already be like,
um,

47
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.920
he'll just sit down next to you like your Forrest Gump and they'll just sit down

48
00:02:27.921 --> 00:02:30.260
and just start talking to you.
So he just said,
you kid,
all right,

49
00:02:30.261 --> 00:02:31.610
well this switch,
you got to watch out for it,
you know,

50
00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:34.580
and I remember my kid and Blah Blah Blah Blah dude.
It's like airplane.

51
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.380
You know what I mean with with a fucking person,

52
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.330
he talks to him and you want to kill yourself.

53
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.750
<v 0>Just wait until he started going to school and you gotta you got to hang out</v>

54
00:02:41.751 --> 00:02:44.300
with these parents all the time because your kid's become friends with their

55
00:02:44.301 --> 00:02:45.250
kids and then you,

56
00:02:45.251 --> 00:02:48.080
you become friends with these people that you would never be fucking friends

57
00:02:48.081 --> 00:02:48.914
with.

58
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.150
<v 1>This is what I do is I just look straight ahead and I don't look at him,</v>

59
00:02:52.151 --> 00:02:53.500
I don't respond to what they're saying.

60
00:02:53.501 --> 00:02:56.830
And then they just sort of the top choir and they gradually leave.

61
00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.410
<v 0>You're going to have to go to dinner with them.</v>

62
00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.460
Your wives can friends with some lady,
you're going to,

63
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:02.050
well let's go on a double date.
Okay fine,

64
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:04.080
you're going to go and this is one guy now he,

65
00:03:04.081 --> 00:03:06.490
he talks and he doesn't look at you.

66
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.000
He tells me these fucking stupid stories about his kid and the basketball team

67
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.460
and he looks at you for a second.
So,

68
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.100
so Adam's in his basketball and he starts looking dumb.

69
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.660
He's like in that did the coach won't put him in the game?

70
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:18.510
And I'm saying like if he's a good player,
he could play.

71
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.530
How can we not gonna put them in the game and he's fucking bling rambling with

72
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:26.770
no regard whatsoever for your attention span.

73
00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:28.510
The entertainment value of what he's saying.

74
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.320
He's just the underlying insecurity of not being able to look at you or he's

75
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.580
selling self-involved,

76
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.790
he's self involved and is doing some weird thing with his hands where he's like,

77
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:39.410
click talking with his hands and I'm going,
Jesus Christ.

78
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.730
It's literally like someone's quitting.
Fantasize about doing to them.
Oh,

79
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.740
I just running,
just running away.
I don't want to hurt them.

80
00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:47.350
The guy's hurt by life.
He's so damaged by live.

81
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:49.480
I don't want to do anything to them.
I just wanna get the fuck away.

82
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.480
I always picture those people and I have a giant roll of duct tape.

83
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.450
<v 1>I just put it on the,
it's like a cartoon level speed?
No,
it's cartoon level.</v>

84
00:03:59.451 --> 00:04:00.680
I just put it on their mouth and I go

85
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.470
and the last one it comes up and over their head and then it hangs down.

86
00:04:06.471 --> 00:04:11.260
The whole rest of the tape is hanging down over there awkwardly and I,

87
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.950
and then I just go back to eating or whatever and they just sit there and slowly

88
00:04:15.951 --> 00:04:16.940
have to take it off.

89
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.350
<v 0>There's some brutal fucking people.
It's,
you know,</v>

90
00:04:22.351 --> 00:04:25.370
there's a bunch of weird people that you,
you know,

91
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.620
you get closer to them and closer to them and you find out about their life.

92
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.230
Yeah.
But you know what?
All those people,
I want to do that too.

93
00:04:31.231 --> 00:04:34.110
I'm sure they're talking about me.
Oh,
for sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.

94
00:04:34.111 --> 00:04:36.810
I'm sure they talk about me too.
That's just how it goes.

95
00:04:36.811 --> 00:04:41.190
Seemed like he was in a bad mood all the time.
Yeah.
Yeah.

96
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.430
This is friend of Ron White's,
who's a friend of mine who,
uh,

97
00:04:44.431 --> 00:04:46.680
the first time he met me he's like,
oh,
I don't know.
And Ron's like,

98
00:04:46.681 --> 00:04:49.530
I'm telling you,
he's a good guy.
Like he's a dad too,

99
00:04:49.531 --> 00:04:52.240
and we're all buddies together now,
but he's like,
I don't know.
I just,

100
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.490
I'm guarded.
I've been beaten down by some of these fucking basketball stories.

101
00:04:56.491 --> 00:04:59.790
It's these assholes will tell you and my kitty,
he's a good player.

102
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.780
He's could play or you just want to put them in the game or

103
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.520
just you think of things that you would torture somebody talking about and you

104
00:05:08.521 --> 00:05:10.380
like,
I would never do this to you.
Why are you doing this to me?

105
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.190
You're not even thinking about verbal water

106
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.290
<v 1>boarding you like in your own little Guantanamo.</v>

107
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.890
That's a great way of describing like,
when is the dessert tray

108
00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.300
<v 0>good.
Say I don't need dessert.</v>

109
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.240
That's part of the problem with hanging around with comedians too was when they

110
00:05:26.241 --> 00:05:30.320
say something like for a good percentage of it,
it's funny.

111
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.400
It doesn't have to be funny all the time,

112
00:05:31.401 --> 00:05:35.090
but a good percentage when you talking to people that aren't funny at all and it

113
00:05:35.091 --> 00:05:38.780
never comes because like surely there's something funny coming eventually.

114
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.190
Nothing,
never,
never something compelling.
Nothing,
not a goddamn thing

115
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.760
and that's when I start thinking like those duct tape fantasies and then I start

116
00:05:49.761 --> 00:05:53.330
making myself laugh and I have to pretend like I'm drinking and then they get

117
00:05:53.331 --> 00:05:54.640
all weirded out because they see something.

118
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.920
<v 1>Yeah,
look on my face and it just a little thing thing.</v>

119
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.550
<v 0>Just fucking,
it just goes south.
Yeah,
I'd usually breathe.</v>

120
00:06:02.551 --> 00:06:03.920
I take these breathing exercises.

121
00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:08.921
I do the Wim Hoff method where I took all my breath in and I let like 15 20% now

122
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.600
there's no way you do that across from a person I guess if he's not looking at

123
00:06:15.601 --> 00:06:19.710
you,
he doesn't say it.
Yeah,
I do.
I do like to watch ready.
You'll be making noise,

124
00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.840
just got shot and you're waiting for the ambulance.

125
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.840
When you're doing like you just try and
stay,

126
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.510
stay Kanchi but together,
try to stay present.

127
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.530
I try to meditate in the face of overwhelming,
retarded conversation.

128
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.000
Just try to detach myself from whatever they're saying.
Find A,

129
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.310
find a happy place.
Find a peaceful spot.

130
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:51.200
<v 2>Yeah.</v>
