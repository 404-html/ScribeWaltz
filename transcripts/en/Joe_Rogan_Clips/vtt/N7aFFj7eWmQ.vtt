00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.800
Oh,
I met a dude yesterday,
glow yoga,
just,
he was like,
let me fly you.

2
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.240
What'd he say?
Acro Yoga.
He puts you on his legs like a baby holds you up,

3
00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:12.360
stretches you and shit.
He was like,
Hey,
do you know Bert Kreischer?

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.640
I would love to do that with him,
and I was like,

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.390
do you normally do like two people on one guy?
And he's like,
what do you mean

6
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.130
get him up?
He goes,
I for sure could not get him up.

7
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.740
That guy was anticipating and human centipede on a trampoline.

8
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.463
Oh my God.

9
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.310
What's that one that swings trapeze,
right?
With the three of you?
I love that.

10
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:43.260
Huh?
Who Do you think loves him?
Come on.

11
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.950
Do you think
we're not doing

12
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.820
all the answer Tom Lancer.
Arielle answer not to answer.

13
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.170
Do you think you'd love Ari?
I'm not joining us.

14
00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.180
I'm missing each other a lot.

15
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.190
My friends,
my friends like me.
You got your crazy.

16
00:01:08.191 --> 00:01:09.870
We focusing on the wrong things.

17
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.480
I spend more time with Ari then.
Okay,
so if one of you tried to attack Ari,

18
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.720
have I have a problem with that?
All right.
We're going to have same shit.
Sorry.

19
00:01:21.721 --> 00:01:24.090
Ari and I have been friends for too long.
Yeah,
you're like,

20
00:01:24.091 --> 00:01:27.510
that doesn't make sense.
It doesn't compute.
This is my friend.

21
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.180
We've got to work this out.
We're going to figure it.

22
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.790
I don't know you as well as I know him for a million hours and then I know you

23
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:36.700
for 400,000 sure.
Really?
Well,

24
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.740
so what the fuck went wrong?
And that's just how we're all,

25
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.790
we all have to kind of be,
so I don't love anybody anymore.

26
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.100
If one of you,
okay,
if we're on an island,
if we're on an island,

27
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:53.940
you got to eat somewhat.
Oh,
you know the answer,
Bro.

28
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.610
You guys are crazy.
What do you think,
buddy?
Let me tell you something.

29
00:01:56.611 --> 00:01:59.850
I'm starving to death for eat.
Any of you?
Yes.

30
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.300
100% I don't know what it's kosher.
Oh my God.

31
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.590
Say Body kill me to eat me.
I don't want to stay alive,
man.

32
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.690
Just a vessel.
I would a hundred percent problem.

33
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.880
It'd be like who you want to kill,
bro?

34
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.240
[inaudible] gets the eyeballs Rogan's ass.

35
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.700
The problem is you don't want to die knowing you ate your friend and it didn't

36
00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:37.950
matter.
We would be don't want to die.

37
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.410
Here's the reality.
Here's the reality.

38
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.380
If you hadn't said this in this scenario is real,

39
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.450
it's three of us would be so paranoid about you killing us that we would

40
00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:51.720
definitely kill.
You will be like,

41
00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:54.510
everything's cool and you and then we would take rocks.

42
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.710
Just thinking through how do we kill that will be to you about over here for the

43
00:03:00.031 --> 00:03:04.430
last second for it to kill us,
right?
Definitely.
Tonight.

44
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.690
He sleeps at the right time.
I think we gotta.
Yeah,

45
00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.750
I'll throw,
I'll get the big rock and you get the other rap.
Seriously,

46
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:16.630
we have competed against him.
How do you think we would go about killing?

47
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:19.360
We would have to make him think that we're definitely not thinking about that

48
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.080
and they'll be like,
hey guys,
we're still way,

49
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.570
but we would try to be slick about it.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

50
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.740
We'd sit by a fire and then I would go,
hey Joe,
when when you eat marijuana,

51
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:31.180
does that break down differently?
Your liver?

52
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.420
11 hydroxy [inaudible] real quick.

53
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.650
No,
you got to think that he would be thinking the same thing too,
so he's like,

54
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.510
oh fuck.
I would never turn it against those guys,

55
00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:46.450
but for sure we're not thinking about it.
They think if I could turn her,

56
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:49.110
get some,
I would.
They're going to,
I've got to kill them.
That's right.

57
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.560
I was going to do it immediately.

58
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.910
Accept the fact you're going to starve to death.
That's where you got to do.

59
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.160
You've got to accept it because if there's only sore for left,

60
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.200
we're in the woods and we're stuck on the top of mountain and no one's gotten to

61
00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:04.490
us yet.
What are the odds they're going to get to us?
What?

62
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.420
How much time we have left,
like 30 hours.

63
00:04:07.421 --> 00:04:10.900
If everything goes great are you would wither away first?
No.

64
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.790
Here's the real truth.
I've just been thinking about it.

65
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:16.300
He tried to say immediately,
guys,
I see what's on both your minds,
your ball.

66
00:04:16.301 --> 00:04:18.640
Think of killing each other.
I get it from both your points of view.

67
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.630
If we do this,
we're never going to survive.
I propose a truce.
Joe,

68
00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:26.890
go hunt food works,
talk to fire the cook.
Obviously Tom,

69
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:28.650
I don't know man,

70
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.990
cause football is just trying to think you know a lot about that.

71
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.030
If it was just us,

72
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.720
just us living in the woods world went to shit and we're like on an episode of

73
00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:46.930
life below zero,

74
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.500
we live in some sort of fucking house and we have put together ourself.

75
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.030
We'll make it just like we got through this weird month.
Okay.

76
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.280
This is fucking strange about being a person,

77
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.100
is that you don't know what your boundaries are.

78
00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:02.380
You just know what you do most of the time.

79
00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.240
So all of a sudden when something comes up that requires way more of what you're

80
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:11.440
used to putting in more,
more dude.

81
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.480
But isn't that fucking with your perspective at all?
So you know.
