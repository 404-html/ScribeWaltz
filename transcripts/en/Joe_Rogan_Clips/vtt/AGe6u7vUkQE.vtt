1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
Here's the thing.
Even when he was a two o five pounder,
right.

2
00:00:02.611 --> 00:00:07.230
And he had a tendency to gas out,
gas out and get,
you know,

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.790
be Chiney to a degree.
But he was always super technical,

4
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.050
highly skilled.
Like I don't think you could Overeem,

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.960
him and his brother both are actually very good fighters and you know,

6
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.660
their struggles have never been a physical one for the most part.
I think,

7
00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:25.290
you know,
they've had,

8
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.640
and that's a difficulty that that is most common amongst fighters is the mental

9
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:34.110
game of it.
Well,
we saw that with,
in Ghana this week.
Yeah.
We seen the fight,

10
00:00:34.111 --> 00:00:37.460
but I heard it was,
it was one for the ages.
It was one for the ages.

11
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.580
Let some lines loosened that thing and just like,
okay,
let's crank this up a bit.

12
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.140
It was the worst heavyweight fight I've ever seen.

13
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.210
It was the worst a of mine before he came down to,

14
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.520
it came down to the sea.

15
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.870
It was the second lowest output fight ever.
Uh,

16
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.810
so they couldn't even make it the lowest output fight to be number one.

17
00:00:57.811 --> 00:00:58.710
I didn't even get to number one.

18
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.070
Number one nail is they failed that failing Jens Pulver versus Joe Hoke from

19
00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:09.261
like a fucking UFC 13 or some shit him and know what day that fight was,

20
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.590
but that fight was number one with 23 or 22 strikes landed in three rounds and

21
00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:22.950
this fight was number two at 23 strikes landed.
That's weird dude.

22
00:01:22.951 --> 00:01:25.230
It was insane.
And then ovary,

23
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.950
I mean a Francis go to Francis and Ganos Instagram.

24
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.260
He released a statement today and his statement was essentially that he was a

25
00:01:33.261 --> 00:01:37.140
over,
he carried the fear.
He said,
I'm not proud of my last performance.

26
00:01:37.141 --> 00:01:40.560
I have applied to this one.
I completely understand the frustration,

27
00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:44.040
anger that it's caused my fans,
coaches,
teammates and family and friends,

28
00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:47.850
weird that he would have fear from the last fight.
We got fucking owned,

29
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.490
wrestle.
He didn't know.

30
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.810
He thought he was the man and then he got owned and then won't.

31
00:01:54.811 --> 00:01:56.610
But he's letting everyone down again.

32
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.340
All I can do now is proved myself and make you proud again.

33
00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:02.400
But look at this picture that he puts up his swinging on him,
him,

34
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.420
him connected one punch.
Yeah.
I mean that's kind of funny.

35
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.110
It should have been him with his head down,
Frances in the future,

36
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.060
if you're gonna,
if you're gonna post a humble shot,
look humble.
Yeah.

37
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.720
This is like I'm calling him.
I can't say that,
that he doesn't legitimately made,

38
00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:23.580
maybe he is carrying some kind of fear from the last fight in terms of losing

39
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:28.220
the result or is a lot of mind fuck that can go into being a fighter and yeah.

40
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.770
But uh,
I think with bounce back,

41
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.040
you've been on both sides and you know,

42
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.970
the first fight back after a kale loss or after getting dominated,

43
00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:42.740
what does that feeling like?
Yeah.

44
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.890
I don't know.
I've been at this shit for so long that for me it's just like,

45
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.490
all right,
that was then,
this is now don't make the same mistakes.

46
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.970
What you've experienced,
everything you've been submitted,

47
00:02:53.971 --> 00:02:56.700
you've been knocked out,
you've knock guys out,
you submitted guys,

48
00:02:56.701 --> 00:02:59.530
you've won the title,
you beat some of the best guys in the world.

49
00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:03.040
You've had fantastic performances.
You'd have performances that frustrated you,

50
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.060
you've experienced at all you've got,
I mean,
in your long career.
I mean,

51
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:10.900
from being the youngest ever heavyweight champion of the world ever.

52
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.160
To how old are you now?
40 40 man.
Dude,
you fucking seen it all.

53
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:16.720
You've literally seen it all.
