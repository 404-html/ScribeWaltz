00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.540
No worries.
What's your all time favorite movie?
If you had a,

2
00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.860
if there was one one move,
you smokey the bandit.
God Damn,

3
00:00:07.861 --> 00:00:11.490
that's a good every time.
That's a good call.

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.230
And if I had to get an in depth and think about it,

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.930
I might go with stroker ace where the,
the giant I thing,
uh,

6
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.130
the smoke tower fell and he goes right under it because these guys were doing

7
00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:24.060
their own stunts.
That shit was real.
That wasn't CGI.
I mean they were doing it.

8
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.020
What was that one movie with the girl?
Her name was domino.

9
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.780
Uh,
he was a detective called domino.
That was it called domino?
Yeah.

10
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.000
I don't remember who,
is that what it's called?

11
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.270
Or are we talking about with Burt Reynolds?
Yeah.
Well you know like the,

12
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.600
what's it called?
Domino Deron.
Cannonball Rem.

13
00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:45.930
And they drove the car into the pool.
Like the Nascar looking thing.
Yeah,

14
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.730
they did that because they were fucking drunk.

15
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.150
They were loaded and they were partying and the camera's just happened to be

16
00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:54.090
rolling that.
And that wasn't planned.
It wasn't part of the script.

17
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.890
They did it because I thought it was funny.
What is it called?
Sharkey's machine.

18
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.790
That's right.
Sharkey's machine.
God Damn,
what years?

19
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.760
That 81 I was 14 years old.
I remember watching this movie on TV.
I was like,

20
00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:07.350
God damn,
I wish I was Burt Reynolds

21
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.550
and the woman who was like his girlfriend.
Oh my God,
she was so hot.
Look at her

22
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.170
leg warmer days and ethics.
That's when they,
yeah,

23
00:01:19.171 --> 00:01:22.140
they had leg warmers back then and then no one had an ass.

24
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.160
They need figure out asses when they figured out acid sir.

25
00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:29.400
Mix a lot ladies and gentlemen,
why people were in a daze.

26
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.190
We didn't even know what to ask was sir.
Mix a lot.

27
00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:35.130
Came along and changed the game.
He came along with baby,

28
00:01:35.131 --> 00:01:38.580
got back and we were like,
wait,
wait,
wait.
Oh my God,
that is better.

29
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.970
It was like everybody just got smelling salts under the nose.
Yeah.

30
00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:46.410
And then the Kardashians fucked it up for all of us.
Everybody woke up.
They did,

31
00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:49.470
but they didn't.
They exploited a whole new system.

32
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.520
You know like Jennifer Lopez had strong ass game way before them.

33
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.790
But it was a legit Latina ass game.
Correct.

34
00:01:56.791 --> 00:02:00.360
From years of dancing and fucking running upstairs and shit.

35
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.020
Right?
Correct.
Whatever the fuck she did.
Well also,

36
00:02:04.021 --> 00:02:07.590
she's like four foot two machine.
Yeah,
she's pretty short.

37
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.480
She's probably five foot one or something.

38
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.980
She's pretty short pack it all in small area.
He got to get it in.

39
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.140
But those movies,
man,

40
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.580
like Burt Reynolds movies for whatever deliverance doesn't get the respect it

41
00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:25.330
deserves.
That is one of the all time greatest drama movies.
Absolutely.

42
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.400
Of all time.

43
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.150
I actually have a picture when I was filming with burden his house somewhere in

44
00:02:30.151 --> 00:02:35.070
my phone,
I'll never find it.
But um,
I was in his memorabilia room,

45
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.680
which also doubled as his weight room and just,

46
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.590
there was stuff everywhere and I was texting the way I was dealing with a

47
00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:44.310
problem and somebody snapped a picture of it and the deliverance,

48
00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.650
a canoe is like laying up against the wall and there's all these different

49
00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:53.370
memorabilia things in there.
And when I say remember be like that,

50
00:02:53.371 --> 00:02:55.290
it was like a hoarding room.
There was just,

51
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.320
everything was in there and it was unbelievable.

52
00:02:58.321 --> 00:03:01.240
It's like the most surreal thing cause I'm hammering away and there's like

53
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.190
everything behind you at that dude.
Here's the other thing about that movie,

54
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:07.360
and by the way,
Burt Reynolds,

55
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.060
University of Florida played football was a fucking dud.

56
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.580
Yeah.
That movie introduced me to the world of compound bows.

57
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.550
I didn't even know what a compound bow was until I saw that movie.

58
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.420
I don't know how to calm down.
Low is now for bow hunting,
bro.
I don't pro hunt,

59
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:25.010
man.
I ain't doing bell.

60
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.590
Ron Burt Reynolds Reynolds.
I was thinking a bow.
Hey Jackson,

61
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:32.830
need you to buy pro rentals.com of Jackson.

62
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.400
I was going to say it's also a big bow hunter,
but something about that movie.

63
00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:39.640
Like when,
who was the guy who was getting fucked when they're like,
squeal,

64
00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:44.440

Thank you.

That guy.
Good actor.

66
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.040
Holy Shit.
You were so scared for him.
