1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.670
The joe rogan experience.
Oh Geez.
Let me say so most,
there's another,

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.300
that whole society that he hasn't touched in on you that I know he knows about.

3
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.450
And that's the Aba Qua society.
WHATSAPP.
A common,
that's a complete,
that's the,

4
00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:19.750
that's the Brotherhood of men and Cuba.
You'll see it.

5
00:00:19.751 --> 00:00:22.350
So as you see an APP,
McGuire,
you know you're dealing with them.

6
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.840
I don't talk to them that they don't giggle.
They don't.

7
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.660
What does that mean?
Like what it,
man,
I fuck with you.

8
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.980
A couple of years ago you were living in Colorado and I saw a kid with a balloon

9
00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:37.470
and I call you balloons and [inaudible] around me and Eddie.

10
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.280
You come up to a number call and call him his nickname.

11
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.120
You got a different situation.
He'll pull you aside and go,

12
00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:49.620
I don't know you and don't you ever fucking call me that outside the circle

13
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:54.370
again.
And when they get mad at you,
okay to prove their manhood,
they,

14
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.080
they beat you,
throw you on the floor,

15
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.570
pull your pants down and slice your ass with a straight razor.

16
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.840
That's worse than fucking a man.
One did that.

17
00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:07.770
The two or three people at my mother's wake guy couldn't come in because one,

18
00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:11.760
it's sliced as asked and I don't know.
This guy took me to baseball games.
One,

19
00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:15.660
get the fuck out.
He stand.
That's the thing that only pussy.

20
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.000
They can't be in a room if another man is gay in the room.
Wow.

21
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.770
Oh yeah.
Guess what Y'all Romero told me it's sold.
Dissolved.

22
00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:30.360
Now that there's gay men and Habaqois 50 years ago,
bro,

23
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.400
Bro,
some people would call that advanced Joey.
That's progress.
What's that?

24
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.170
Now there's game.
Well,
yeah,
yeah.
No,
no.
Look,
look at the surprise.

25
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.193
They had the gay man,

26
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.250
but 50 years ago when I went to Albert quarters were in the room.

27
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.240
You had to be on your best behavior.
They don't speak Spanish.

28
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.790
[inaudible]
they have their own line.
They have their own language.
Oh,

29
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.970
and I know it.
I know it.
They have their own language,

30
00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.440
their own language in Spanish.
It's a,
it's like a Patois.
It's like a Patois.

31
00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:03.660
It's based on African Monina.
I said,
hey,

32
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.880
when I call you Monina,
that's my brother and that thing.

33
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.950
What's the Organization of this group?
I mean,
is it is,

34
00:02:10.951 --> 00:02:15.090
it shows the long shore man.
There's a matter of Cuba.

35
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.190
They don't even eat pussy.
That's such a man.
But they add,

36
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.100
they could fuck other men and other men could suck.
They're big.

37
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.000
They're big in prison systems.
Prager system.
They can fuck other men.

38
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.350
Oh yeah,
I could.
I could pick you out and go,
Joe,
you're no longer Joe.

39
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:32.190
You're Josephine.

40
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.050
We'll get a wig and put lipstick on by the away and I'll fuck you in the ass and

41
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:38.190
you're going to suck my dick.

42
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.740
Don't you ever fucking think you're gonna fucking kiss me and touch me?

43
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.350
And they'd beat you.
You can shut up.
You fucking whore.

44
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.570
You can fuck somebody else,

45
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.950
but you can't be fucking man every fuck by another man.
That's a lot.

46
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.860
But if a man wants to shuck it,
next,
let them,

47
00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:56.570
so I remember one night he used to tell him,

48
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.930
I guys suck my Dick one time when ice cubes in his mouth.
It was tremendous.

49
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.640
What fucking talking about?
Well,

50
00:03:04.641 --> 00:03:09.640
that was the fourth grade I was surrounded with.
You say hello a certain way?

51
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.500
Yeah.
What?
Like,
I'll show you a knob.

What does the strato pulling up?

54
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.730
There's a bunch of,
yeah,
here on Youtube.
I'll show you the dance one is the one.

55
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:30.010
You have to see how they dance,

56
00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:34.060
how they move about quite you rule,
bull,
whatever.

57
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.760
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

60
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.090
<v 0>And so these are just serious dudes.</v>

61
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.530
Habaqois and then put in y o r u.

62
00:03:49.531 --> 00:03:53.990
B a and let me tell it.
We'll see what comes up.
It's also African base also.

63
00:03:53.991 --> 00:03:58.880
Africa has a musical elements right there.
Right there.
There you go.

64
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.930
Okay.
Let me show you what an Abbott choirs and they're all dressed in white.

65
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.460
They're all dressed in white.
It's still dressed in white.
No women allowed.

66
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.420
No nothing.
The place.
Some of this Jamie said,
we can hear it.

67
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.313
<v 1>No women.</v>

68
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.480
<v 0>Nah,
though there's woman woman's second.</v>

69
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.560
A woman there,
we'll,
we'll dance every day.
Yeah.

70
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.450
So you see the woman on the right?

71
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.413
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

72
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.560
<v 0>I'll see how the guy shows up.
That's an albacore look at this fucking beauty.</v>

73
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.000
Yeah.
The colors are white and red.
Right?
You will see red.
That's the guy.

74
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.360
The,
the,
the

75
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.170
like the tin man from the wizard of Oz there.
The,
you know,

76
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.520
just saying that could get a break there to salute with your elbows.
Hit it back,

77
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.840
get a bad you,
you,
you could suffer.

78
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.670
Making fun of making fun of it.
Wow.
If I see him,
that's how I do it.

79
00:04:58.671 --> 00:05:03.530
This dog let me know.
But
you touch elbows,
touch elbows.

80
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.210
Wow.
And now there's actually gay men in there now.
It's diluted so much.

81
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.100
Ah,
it's been diluted over the years.
But when,
when I met Juan and Leo,

82
00:05:13.101 --> 00:05:17.780
they would two ob applause.
Uh,
but Taco tico or Latin band,

83
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.440
not the cube,
not the Congo,
the singer.
He was up quality.

84
00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.000
So if you were a quad,
you just,
there was a code,
the way you behave.

85
00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:29.180
Very badly.
Code.
I come over here,

86
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.190
there's a gay man and he I call you out of the room like,
oh do me a favor,

87
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.160
get that mother fucker out of the room.
Or if not,
you can't talk to them.

88
00:05:37.161 --> 00:05:38.710
You can't approach him a certain way.

89
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.060
Cuba experienced a lot of progressive ideology.
Like is it,

90
00:05:43.061 --> 00:05:45.840
have they changed the way it's very progressive now.

91
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.700
What's caused this cause they really do a rebel progress changing things.

92
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.960
Yeah,
but their progress.
I mean there are so isolated,

93
00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.320
they didn't have the Internet right?
They don't have the Internet.
No.
No.

94
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:03.430
I think certain places and they're getting it now.
I think certain places,

95
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.020
yeah you can get it here and there.
It's not great.

96
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.460
It's frustrating when you go there cause he can't.
What's,

97
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:14.150
what's Nice is you go to Havana and you kind of disengage from modern

98
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:15.530
technology.
I love it.

99
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.910
I mean you couldn't live there cause he can't really do business there.
Right.

100
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.920
But you just kind of disengage from.

101
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.340
And is it easy to travel there now as far as like flights from America?

102
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.990
Just legal like a motherfucker
fucking hilarious.

103
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.900
I remember when I was a kid,
like if you had a Cuban cigar,

104
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:36.650
it was like a big deal.
I don't tell anybody we got Cubans.

105
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.580
Well that's still,
that's still illegal.
No,
it's the embargo.

106
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.970
The embargo is still exists.
Yeah,
but you could have some cigars.

107
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.780
You're allowed to have some Cuban cigars.
Right.
You ever like,
see if you,
uh,

108
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.810
what does the amount of,
I think you're allowed to have like 10.

109
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.990
You can't bring them back.
Yeah.
You can't sell them here.

110
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.740
Or if you can sell them here,
you can't sell a lot.
Something like that.

111
00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:03.410
And I'm happy he wrote this book because I knew the story was out that job.

112
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.910
Like we haven't even touched.
I'm like,
I was raised by Omega seven guy.

113
00:07:07.911 --> 00:07:09.680
Like he grew up with my father.

114
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.260
So I told Joey when I first met him,

115
00:07:13.261 --> 00:07:16.340
and I was sort of almost done with this book.
I said,

116
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.870
I said,
when you read it,
you're going to need to sit down.

117
00:07:20.871 --> 00:07:25.400
Because for a guy like him,
he knew a lot.

118
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.610
And I knew he would come across names that he knew,

119
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.050
but there's no way you could have been part of this and known the whole thing.

120
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.430
Right,
right.
So you,
you like,
you knew who thought it was.

121
00:07:37.431 --> 00:07:38.290
You knew he was a bad guy.

122
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.410
He didn't know [inaudible] was a professional assassin for Omega seven.

123
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.650
I knew thought they killed my mother warned me and my mother used to go,

124
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.180
when he picks you up at school,

125
00:07:47.181 --> 00:07:50.150
please don't get in the car with him cause he's going to get shot one day and I

126
00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:51.890
don't want to enter people new battle.

127
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.690
And they knew some things about him but they didn't know,

128
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.340
don't want who was part of it.
They thought they knew the whole story.

129
00:07:58.341 --> 00:08:01.290
But there's no way you could've,
you couldn't done it all.
It,

130
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.050
it blew my fucking mind.

131
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:06.230
I went to a dance with my daughter and I came home and the book was waiting for

132
00:08:06.231 --> 00:08:08.870
me,
you know,
Amazon and drops it off in front of your house.

133
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:14.260
And they had ripped it and there was other kids and other moms with my wife and

134
00:08:14.331 --> 00:08:18.110
I don't like did was put it in my office and when I opened it I saw a.
Dot.

135
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:23.120
D and Munchie and my fucking knee dropped like it had hit me.

136
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.050
He kept texting me as you were reading at 12 o'clock at night and I go,

137
00:08:27.051 --> 00:08:27.884
you have no,

138
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.830
but I didn't know that this guy used to go every six months and his wife was

139
00:08:33.831 --> 00:08:35.590
tight.
You know the story I told you about,

140
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.260
my mom would play cards and then I would put tidy whities on and dance for the

141
00:08:39.261 --> 00:08:43.910
women to be shots of Tequila and make me dance.
Neda was in that book.

142
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.780
Nina is in that book.
When my mother died,
I gave me to my dog.

143
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:48.950
I couldn't take that dog.

144
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.960
So I used to go to Nina's house on 51st street and cry in the dog house.

145
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:56.880
Like this was my dog.
So as soon as I saw Tati,

146
00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:01.910
I knew he was onto something because Dottie was my father's friend and he was a

147
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:06.400
type of guy that would come visit me every week just because he was my fault,

148
00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:09.490
his friend,
and give me 50 bucks and take me to the city.

149
00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:12.900
You get haircuts with his claim to fame was in the seventh grade.

150
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.730
My mother told him,
I don't know what I'm gonna do with him.

151
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.760
He's got some fucking girlfriend.
He won't even talk to me.

152
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:22.020
This guy came to my house and gave me a capsule and right in front of me,

153
00:09:22.021 --> 00:09:25.170
he filled it up with coke and he goes,
let me tell you something.
Seventh grade,

154
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.370
seventh grade,
he goes,
next time this girl comes over,

155
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.920
you sprinkled his coke on a pussy and you lick it.
And I'm like,

156
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.020
I didn't even like a pussy that I hadn't touched that outside the genes,

157
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.260
that coat capsule was in my draw for like a year,

158
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:45.120
like in the back of my nightstand.
Right.
I didn't,
you know,
I wasn't out.

159
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:49.110
It wasn't a driving,
nothing.
At one night,
my mom came home with three cocktails,

160
00:09:49.111 --> 00:09:49.944
and then she's like,

161
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:55.230
I got fucking news today from Tophi that he gave you cocaine.

162
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:59.370
What the fuck is,
I got some my draw it and use it.
She fucking smack me.
She goes,

163
00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:03.340
don't you have a fucking take drugs and I,
she wasn't dead it,
Eh,

164
00:10:03.341 --> 00:10:06.480
you know what I'm saying?
Then she went and did the blast,
but that guy,

165
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:10.320
when I was in the [inaudible],
Greg gave me a capsule of coke.
Wow.
And said,

166
00:10:10.321 --> 00:10:12.520
put it on a bus.
You drive a four pack.

167
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.660
Like that's how good he was.

168
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.060
<v 2>Okay.</v>
