00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.070
Hello Freak bitches.
That's deep.
That is deep.

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.240
This is going to be hurtful to a lot of people.

3
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.160
A lot of people listening to this right now,
very upset,
very triggered.

4
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.880
You asked earlier why,
why the postmodernists don't like blunt speech?
Yeah,

5
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.780
well that's why man,
you know,
it's like the truth is something that Burns,

6
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.130
it burns off deadwood and people don't like having their dead wood burned off

7
00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:30.930
often because they're like 95% deadwood and,
and I'm not being,
I'm believe me,

8
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:34.020
I'm not being snide about that.
It's no joke.

9
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.130
When you start to realize how much of what you've constructed of yourself is

10
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.660
based on deception and lies,
that is a horrifying realization.

11
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.400
And it can easily be 95% of you at your things.
You say things,
you act out,

12
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.040
you know it's well,
you see that in Pinocchio,
which I often you discussed.

13
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.070
You Know Pinocchio,
when he gets corrupt,
as he,
as he matures,

14
00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.200
he first learns to lie and then he becomes a brain jackass on pleasure island.

15
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.010
It's like,
and he's threatened by the underground authoritarians,
right?

16
00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:08.550
They're going to sell them to the salt mines.
It's like,
yeah,
that's for sure.

17
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.900
It's exactly right man.

18
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.280
So then you figure out you're a brain jackass and you're lying all the time.

19
00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:15.720
That's a terrible realization.

20
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.950
And then all that needs to be burned away and know people don't like that.

21
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:21.523
You know?

22
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.570
Now you've been embattled in this conflict for quite a long time and I've got to

23
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:30.720
imagine that the way you look at the world,
the way you see things,
many,

24
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:31.710
many steps ahead.

25
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.250
Do you see any sort of a logical conclusion to this process?

26
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.860
Do you see any light at the end of the tunnel or do you see an impossible to

27
00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:47.170
avoid conflict?
Like do you what?

28
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.600
What do you see when you look at this whole thing long term?
Well,

29
00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:55.470
I would say I can't look at it long term.
And the reason for that is that,

30
00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.120
and this is why I get a kick out of all the Keck Keka Stan Boys,

31
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.540
you know,
I do believe that we're in a period of chaos.
What's a Keck is tech.
Oh,

32
00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:08.540
Keck is a mythological country that's ruled by chaos by the god Keck,

33
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.370
who's a frog.
The frog as it turns out.
Um,
so I don't know.

34
00:02:13.371 --> 00:02:15.630
I don't know about those.
Oh,
well you need to look them up.

35
00:02:15.631 --> 00:02:19.140
That's a big internet thing.
Keka Stan.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

36
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.810
They Internet thing all know about the frog is the frog.

37
00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:24.560
The Trump frog pepe the frog where they've,

38
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.750
who has apparently so distraught that has frog has been used to a lie on them

39
00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:33.000
off a killed him off.
What?
Good luck.
He didn't.
All right.

40
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:36.070
So that's stupid because that's not who were,
um,

41
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.500
who were using pepe.
I haven't got the story quite right,

42
00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:41.550
but I'll get it mostly right.

43
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.200
The people who were using peppy as a meme art is used.
Yeah.

44
00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:50.550
That public of Keka staff,
they use this symbol,

45
00:02:50.551 --> 00:02:53.700
k e k to replace lol.

46
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.200
And the reason they did that was because k e k in Korean means lol.

47
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.630
And so it was just this little joke.
Keck,
k.
E.
K.

48
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.810
Well then somebody found out these were people who were using pepe.

49
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:06.100
Remember it's a frog.

50
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.110
Then people found out that Keck was an Egyptian God and he was a frog and he was

51
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:14.650
between categories,
sort of like a transsexual by the way.

52
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.790
He was between categories and so now they have this republic of Keck and it's

53
00:03:19.791 --> 00:03:24.110
ruled by this Egyptian God whose name is Ken,
who's a frog.
Hold on,
go back,

54
00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.730
go back,
go.
They'll keep changing this.

55
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.300
Jamie's doing this in the background while you're talking,
but look at this.

56
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.720
There's a frog with a make America great again hat and he's got like a

57
00:03:35.811 --> 00:03:36.471
tombstone.

58
00:03:36.471 --> 00:03:41.420
It says those who served in the meme war 2015 and 2016 we are the gods of the

59
00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:45.590
great meme.
More we are the shit posters,
the legion of Keck.

60
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.850
We are the Internet,

61
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.900
the death of the normies lulls and CAC.

62
00:03:50.901 --> 00:03:53.700
We are one way or the fuck is going on that.

63
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.680
That is the question and that's the question you asked me and my answer was,

64
00:03:57.681 --> 00:04:00.620
I don't know.
We're in a period of chaos.

65
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.530
We were in a period of chaos and in a period of chaos,

66
00:04:03.531 --> 00:04:07.220
the time horizon shrinks because no,
because the outcome is uncertain.
Well,

67
00:04:07.221 --> 00:04:11.390
this seems to be truly embracing chaos.
I mean just that statement,

68
00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.310
the frog,
the Donald Trump thing with the hat on this.

69
00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.270
See this is one of the things it seems to me to be a reoccurring feature in this

70
00:04:20.271 --> 00:04:21.050
whole,
uh,

71
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:26.050
chaos ballet that we're watching play out is that people are enjoying the fact

72
00:04:26.691 --> 00:04:31.190
that Donald Trump sucks as a president.
They don't feel threatened by it.

73
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.160
They like it and they don't don't like it because they want to burn this

74
00:04:34.161 --> 00:04:38.060
motherfucker to the ground and towards this thing and like a Phoenix,

75
00:04:38.061 --> 00:04:42.130
we will arise from the fire.
No,
no,
it's not that.
It's that they,

76
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.750
they are enjoying that.
It's falling apart.

77
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.590
This is why the we are the shit posters.
Do you know what shit posting is?
Yeah.

78
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.110
Jamie explained shit posting.
You're really good explaining it.

79
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.560
Posting for like literally no reason other than to get someone mad.

80
00:04:56.561 --> 00:05:00.220
That's almost like trolling,
but it's like a separate level of trolling.
Right?

81
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.630
It's a good way to say it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's a good way.

82
00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:03.400
It's a provocation for its own sake.

83
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.760
Jamie's the first person to tell me about shit posting.

84
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.790
I wasn't aware until about what a year ago.
Yeah.
I think it was.
Yeah.

85
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.910
Better about preelection time did not know.
So,

86
00:05:13.911 --> 00:05:16.870
I mean there's rules for operating in chaos,
right?

87
00:05:16.871 --> 00:05:19.790
Cause that's when you're in the belly of the beast or the belly of the whale and

88
00:05:19.791 --> 00:05:22.940
you're underwater,
you're in the underworld,
you're in underworld,
in chaos.

89
00:05:22.941 --> 00:05:26.310
And so that's a really cool thing to know Joe.
So imagine that the,

90
00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.590
the normal world of mankind is inside that dominance hierarchy where everything

91
00:05:30.591 --> 00:05:34.070
is going well because nothing abnormal is happening and you're getting what you

92
00:05:34.071 --> 00:05:38.750
need and you want and you're conscious knowledge suffices.
Right?
Okay.

93
00:05:38.751 --> 00:05:42.970
But then something tilts and that structure no longer works.
So where do you up?

94
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.940
He ended up in underworld.
That's what happens when your partner of 20 years has,

95
00:05:46.941 --> 00:05:51.140
uh,
has a long term affair and you find out about it.

96
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.470
It's like you thought you knew where you were but you didn't.

97
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.890
And now that you found out you don't where you are,

98
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.510
but when you don't know where you are,
you're in the underworld.
Right.

99
00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:05.810
And that's where the unconscious forces play.
Those are the gods.

100
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.140
It's why there's God's in the underworld and people go to the underworld all the

101
00:06:09.141 --> 00:06:12.230
time.
It's chaos and fear and depression,

102
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.050
hopelessness and imaginativeness.
It's everything.

103
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.710
It's KLM is terrifying to people.
Terrifying and promising.

104
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.910
Terrifying and promising.
Cause dragons have gold because it's always,

105
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.960
the unknown has two things.
Just like the future.

106
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.710
It's like look out,
it'll do you in and look out.

107
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.290
It offers everything to you.
That's the underworld.

108
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.600
That's why the hero always goes into the underworld to find a cave full of gold.

109
00:06:37.601 --> 00:06:42.540
It's true.
Guarded by a dragon in the hobbit.
Literally.
That's Bill Wolfe flight.

110
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.850
That's the oldest story of mankind.
It's really the our oldest story.
Wow.

111
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.410
And so that the underworld is chaos.
It's chaos.

112
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:53.900
And down there there's all sorts of play of possibility.

113
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.590
And the reason the frog was the was the guardian of chaos is because of the,

114
00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.980
the frog is this thing that doesn't fit into categories.
You see,

115
00:07:00.981 --> 00:07:05.660
because it's partly water.
It's partly land.
It's tadpole,
yet it's,
it's adult,

116
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.900
right?
So it's like a fish and then it's like an animal.
It doesn't fit.

117
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.160
And it's things that don't fit that blow apart the categories,
right?

118
00:07:13.161 --> 00:07:16.310
Well that's what the transsexuals,
due to the category of gender for example.

119
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.750
And that puts you in this state of chaos.
It puts you in this state of chaos.

120
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.420
And that's what we're in now.
We're in a state of chaos.

121
00:07:23.421 --> 00:07:26.270
And so what are the rules for operating in a state of chaos?

122
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:27.590
But as far as I can tell,

123
00:07:27.591 --> 00:07:31.220
the fundamental rule when operating in chaos is tell the truth.

124
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.340
So for example,
if you went for the people that want to navigate this successful,

125
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.960
Yup.
All you've got,
that's what you've got as a,

126
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.680
as a shield and a weapon and,
and uh,

127
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:46.850
and that,
that's the guidepost.
That's the,
that's the way through.
Well,

128
00:07:46.851 --> 00:07:51.380
and you see that and hero stories all the time,
you know,
so it's,
it's a lot.

129
00:07:51.381 --> 00:07:54.140
Its allegiance to the truth,
but the truth is a strange thing.

130
00:07:54.141 --> 00:07:56.270
It's a very strange thing.
Often the hero in a,

131
00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:01.520
in his story has to assimilate their dark side before they're capable of telling

132
00:08:01.521 --> 00:08:04.910
the truth.
Right?
In the Hobbit,
for example,
he has to become a thief,

133
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.160
right?
Because he has to get tough.
That's the thing.
That's the thing.
Also,

134
00:08:10.161 --> 00:08:13.970
the thing about telling the truth is that it's not for,
it's not for the naive,

135
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.980
not at all.
And partly because it burns off deadwood.

136
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:22.040
It's partly because it hurts people's feelings.
It's a sword.

137
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:27.770
So you have to be a warrior.
Wow.

138
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:32.630
A truth warrior
in this time of chaos,

139
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:37.310
right.
What emerges from this,
right?
Sometimes,

140
00:08:37.311 --> 00:08:41.540
sometimes it's catastrophe.
That's the thing about these categories.
They're real,

141
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:46.400
they're real.
And you know,
the optimists that I hear say,
well,

142
00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:49.190
depending on them swings and then it swings back and I think,
yeah,

143
00:08:49.191 --> 00:08:50.090
well sometimes it,

144
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.930
it takes a hundred years to swing back and it takes a hell of a lot of people

145
00:08:53.931 --> 00:08:57.780
out on the way and it never swings back at all.
So,
you know,

146
00:08:57.781 --> 00:09:02.010
sometimes people go out to fight a dragon and it just eats them or it burns
them.

147
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.500
And that's the end of that.
Right.

148
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:09.240
And like we're in an unstable period of time at the moment in a transition

149
00:09:09.241 --> 00:09:11.640
period of some sort.
I can't put my finger on it,

150
00:09:11.641 --> 00:09:16.050
but I know that that's partly why what I've been saying has been resonating with

151
00:09:16.051 --> 00:09:20.190
people,
because obviously it's not about pronouns.
Well,
it is.

152
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:22.253
It is,
except

153
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.270
language turns out to be about a lot more than like,

154
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:31.440
you can't take a little thing like the desire to transform pronouns and think

155
00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:32.410
that that's a little thing.
