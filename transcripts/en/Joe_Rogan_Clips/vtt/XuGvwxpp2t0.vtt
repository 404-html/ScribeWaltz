1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.520
Right?
And he,
he looked,
looks like that.
He's like that fire.

2
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.020
I've seen exactly that.

3
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.060
So you want to talk about what that real controllers of the grays are?

4
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.450
It looks like,
sorry,
have you ever had a significant head injury?

5
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.450
<v 1>What happened to
what happened to you?</v>

6
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.800
<v 0>You know they're going to NPR piece going on next week.</v>

7
00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:24.800
Cause I apologize in the gun.
I never did that.
What happened?

8
00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:28.640
What happened to your head?
I've been polygraph.
You,
somebody's pile drive to you.

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.910
What happened?
How old were you?

10
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.530
There's about 13 1314 many pile drived you and you had to change your

11
00:00:36.531 --> 00:00:39.300
personality.
I got up and punched him in the throat and the head,
Drake anatomy,

12
00:00:39.301 --> 00:00:43.770
I was dead.
Wow.
So was it a friend of the US?

13
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.030
It was like the state wrestling champion,
middle white and he,

14
00:00:47.031 --> 00:00:51.560
his cousin or something in the Dallas was like this like,
you know,
got me down.

15
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.840
I was never starting five man.
These people,
here's the thing,

16
00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:57.860
I'm out of victim of racial attacks.
I'm not like Jeffrey or Jessie.

17
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.230
Smaller is,
I fought rednecks and I got my leg broken.
You know by,

18
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.710
so this guy pile drive you in your head,
you knew 13
yeah.

19
00:01:06.711 --> 00:01:08.810
And then what did it do to your personality then?

20
00:01:08.811 --> 00:01:12.560
I had to fight his whole family.
Most his family.
It was a gamechanger.

21
00:01:12.561 --> 00:01:16.370
Did it change,
but did you have any significant change from that head injury?

22
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.600
Sometimes when people have entered juries especially,
it seems like,
you know,

23
00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:22.730
stuff's just got better.
Real.

24
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.693
<v 1>Oh,
a lot of</v>

25
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.610
serious.
It's like,
dude,
we got to get to the root timing.
That's good timing.
No,

26
00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:34.350
no,
no,
no.
I mean I,
that's happening.

27
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.840
<v 0>No doubt.</v>

28
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.050
My friend Dave Foley was just on here and he was talking about how he got drunk

29
00:01:39.051 --> 00:01:41.570
and he fell down and cracked his head and it,
it's crazy,

30
00:01:41.571 --> 00:01:44.240
but it cured his depression.
Got a little excited behind this.

31
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.670
Any given time.
If somebody is a regular guy,
I would never start a fight.

32
00:01:49.671 --> 00:01:52.160
They kicked my ass.
Like the average hundred 50 pound guy.

33
00:01:52.161 --> 00:01:52.994
You're probably hearing bias,

34
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.910
but when like a bunch of people are coming after me,

35
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.850
it's like Darth Vader and

36
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.080
<v 1>I was a kid.
I mean,
I've heard rob</v>

37
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.250
<v 0>bash somebody's head into the concrete when they attack me.
I got hard.
Hell.</v>

38
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.160
And when the kid dropped you on your head,

39
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.140
what effect did it have on you physically?

40
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.580
It was by the field house because his cousin had attacked me and I'd beat him
up.

41
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.740
And so the state wrestling champ was like a senior comes and goes.
Oh yeah.

42
00:02:23.741 --> 00:02:26.200
He came around and he got up one on my head was bleeding,

43
00:02:26.201 --> 00:02:29.300
like he'd won and I punched him in the neck and broke us.

44
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.890
It had a tracheotomy almost died.
And I was like,
yeah,
he almost killed me.

45
00:02:32.891 --> 00:02:35.950
He was like,
he couldn't,
like,
he slammed me in the ground.
My head's bleeding,

46
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.300
all these stitches right here.

47
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.080
And then he couldn't believe when I got up and said,
well,
you die.

48
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.180
He couldn't understand like the energetic of equivalents.

49
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.740
He couldn't understand being the nail.

50
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.870
You can only understand being the hammer he and understand that.
And then they,

51
00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:54.850
you know,
they took me to jail.
They let me go.
I'm on some tough guy.
The point is,

52
00:02:54.851 --> 00:02:58.480
I'm getting killed.
I'm gonna fight back.
And so Dallas was like,

53
00:02:58.481 --> 00:03:02.370
what happened to your after that?
I mean I uh,

54
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.350
I never ever got knocked out in that one.
Uh,

55
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.350
they slammed my head in the ground and I remember like everybody made a joke

56
00:03:09.351 --> 00:03:12.900
cause the concrete cracked.
Oh chimeras like on the edge of the congress.
He,

57
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.380
he called rob me right into the concrete.
I'm like,
split my head way over,

58
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:19.910
but let's just write a story.
And I remember just getting up,
I was like,

59
00:03:19.911 --> 00:03:23.120
slow motion puts you right in the neck and the ambulances,
the police came.

60
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.680
That was that story.
Did you go to the hospital?

61
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.860
<v 1>Okay.</v>

62
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.500
<v 0>No,
they took me to jail for that,
but then they'd let me go.</v>

63
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.600
They didn't check your head.
Did you tell them you got piled?
Try?
No,

64
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.350
they solved it up.
They sewed it up in the,
in the jail.

65
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.610
They didn't like check to see if you had a severe concussion or a I'm dermal

66
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:45.280
hematoma.
No.
Wow.
Go ahead.

67
00:03:45.281 --> 00:03:49.660
Joseph had been the one you think that he's a conspiracy theorist cause it got

68
00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:53.440
dropped on his head.
Uh,
I think,
I think there's something,

69
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.180
there's something to people that have had head trauma that become brilliant at

70
00:03:58.181 --> 00:03:59.770
speaking things.
It's true.

71
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.950
The blast got dumped like his job,

72
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.400
his name is Cory strange.

73
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.350
The only reason he won when he was battered or power for the me is he does he

74
00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:15.340
have like fucking,
he had six packs of the Arnold Schwarzenegger Black Dude.

75
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.840
He waited and gloated while blood was coming out of my head.
Oh Shit.

76
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.330
He lost.
Was He loaded?
Yeah.
Um,
but you're,

77
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.530
you broke the concrete with your head.
That's big.
No,
you didn't.

78
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.980
The concrete didn't actually break in it.
Maybe it did,
but they made the job.

79
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.470
Okay.
So either a dinner got knocked out.
He's still got spiked on it.
Call me.
No.

80
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.730
Do getting spine your head on the concrete.

81
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.850
Shogun myself with other people for fun.
I've never been knocked out.
Okay.

82
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:50.790
So I don't think one time a guy here named got drove hold daggers.
Incorrect.

83
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.550
You're incorrect.
So you,
you absolutely as a kid barely tapped his head,

84
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.730
he would have been knocked out.
Maybe not.
It doesn't matter.

85
00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.680
Like sometimes people get knocked out through severe head injury.

86
00:05:00.681 --> 00:05:03.770
Sometimes they don't.
Sometimes they're head of the ratchet.

87
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.870
Hold on.
Sometimes they never lose consciousness.

88
00:05:07.871 --> 00:05:11.410
You can't think that they always lose consciousness.
Sometimes it's cracked out.

89
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.190
I will see like numbers like I was a robot and then red I would see like

90
00:05:15.191 --> 00:05:20.040
remember she sees random.
Yeah.
I was like no,
I'm not kidding.

91
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.550
No,
that's your story.
That's your story dude.

92
00:05:24.551 --> 00:05:28.570
Man When you get dang there's something about getting dinged with a punch and

93
00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:31.960
you see that flash and you realize that you let your central nervous system is

94
00:05:31.961 --> 00:05:35.530
like 30% functionally like whoa.

95
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.590
The variable but very weird feeling.
She Joe's done it.

96
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.990
That's what the people say.
She stars.
Yeah.
That's what it looks at.
Ferring said,

97
00:05:41.991 --> 00:05:44.200
oh Hollywood stars because they'd seen the stars.

98
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.490
Like each star is like a whole data bank and I remember like some dude choking

99
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:49.420
me and like guys are like,

100
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.320
somebody was like pulling a knife out and she's at knife point out your and

101
00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.440
at that point you are she everything for only those minutes when everything's

102
00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:06.210
clear it's like survival emotions.
But then you see like,

103
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.470
like the wars and the attacks,

104
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.200
the submarines of the spacecraft and like,

105
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.130
it's like when you dial into that it's like total war.
It's like,

106
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.100
didn't you say that when your friends would choke you out you'd have with these

107
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:23.210
long dreams?
Oh yeah.
No,
no,
no.
It'd be off for a couple percent in junior high.

108
00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:26.420
Sixth,
seventh,
eighth grade because we,
I got choked out a couple of our times.

109
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.950
I finally stopped and there'd always be like,
guys like it's incredible.

110
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:34.460
We do this during lunch and we'd go back and like someone press on their

111
00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:39.400
arteries and the bad times when you hit your habit and be like one time like I

112
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.290
remember this one time I,
they choke me out.

113
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:46.340
And also it was like a black knight with a sword goes in like a tax me on this

114
00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:48.200
horse and then why.

115
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.640
And then I was like in England thousands of years ago and I had this wife for

116
00:06:52.641 --> 00:06:56.930
these kids and it was a whole lifetime like taking care of them and like growing

117
00:06:56.931 --> 00:06:59.570
food,
like a kid starved to death or died.

118
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:04.940
And it was like just those moments where like whole lives,

119
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.580
dead kids,
everything.
That's what I'm saying.

120
00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:12.080
Like you dial in to all those ancestors and it was like my kids and kids

121
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:14.990
starving to death and like people attacking us.

122
00:07:14.991 --> 00:07:18.560
And so you think all that information from your ancestors somehow or another

123
00:07:18.561 --> 00:07:20.750
encoded somewhere in deadline coated Joe.

124
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.480
That makes sense.
If you think about what reincarnation must feel like,

125
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.460
you know when,
when people have that feeling,

126
00:07:28.461 --> 00:07:32.780
they felt this feeling that they live before our whole bodies are everybody

127
00:07:32.781 --> 00:07:36.950
before us.
Right?
Well it's not quite exactly.
So people,
they underestimate like,

128
00:07:36.951 --> 00:07:38.740
oh I live before.
No,

129
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.350
they all live before they would also explain certain fears that people just have

130
00:07:42.351 --> 00:07:44.480
as children.
Like children have a fear of animals.

131
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.280
Like you see an animal with big teeth.

132
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.230
Children have ever been attacked by k but their ancestors got killed by them.

133
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:55.280
Yeah.
They probably got attacked by some bear somewhere and you know,

134
00:07:55.281 --> 00:07:59.580
and somehow or another they got through and they survived and that left her
side.

135
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.520
The whole tribe.
Yup.
Yup.
It's,
it makes sense how animals learn things.
I mean,

136
00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:05.750
animals just know things.

137
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.620
My dog would epigenics they have stuff where they can take 10 generation

138
00:08:09.621 --> 00:08:14.621
chickens enclosed closed ut did a study on this like 20 years ago and fly a hawk

139
00:08:14.871 --> 00:08:17.750
over.
They all ranch here.
They fly triangle.
Nobody here.

140
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:22.750
The exact shape of a hawk makes all the chickens run because they've,
it's,

141
00:08:22.751 --> 00:08:25.430
it's,
it's programming.
Exactly.
Exactly.
