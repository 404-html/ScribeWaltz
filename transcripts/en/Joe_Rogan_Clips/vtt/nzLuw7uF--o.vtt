1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.400
We were just talking about a show that you got,
you and Ted Nugent.

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.430
Apparently someone did someone,
did you pitch it?
Who pitched the show?

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.080
It was an idea that uh,
my manager Heidi and I came up with,

4
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.000
well mostly Heidi,
it was like,
it was called basically Henry and uh,

5
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.010
you put me and someone I might have some disagreements with or a few agreements

6
00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:27.051
with and we just go somewhere and we weigh in with a camera following us and

7
00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:31.650
we're thinking w it'll be like a six part mini series like you know me and plus

8
00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:32.820
six interesting people.

9
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.150
And one of the names that came up was ted Nugent because I am a fan of his

10
00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:41.400
music.
I think he's one of the best guitar players I've ever seen yet.

11
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.850
He and I would probably disagree on one or a few topics and so we actually

12
00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:53.100
picked,
pitched it to Ted who said he loved the idea,

13
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.900
but he said,
I got to go on.
I'm busy with a,
he had a ton of tour dates,

14
00:00:57.901 --> 00:00:59.970
so I think he's on now.
But he said,

15
00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:03.360
I want to talk to Henry to thank him for thinking of me.
Okay.

16
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.350
And so ted called like on my phone in the office,

17
00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:12.351
I guess he got my number from the powers that be and suddenly it's,

18
00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:16.170
it's Ted on my phone.
I met my desk like,
okay,

19
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:18.060
this is surreal.

20
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.930
And we talked for a few minutes and he said,

21
00:01:23.941 --> 00:01:28.170
uh,
you know,
like,
what do you think I'm a bad guy?
I'm like,
no,

22
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.330
I just,
some of the things you say,
I just,

23
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.260
I kind of takes my breath away.

24
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.560
And then we quickly got on the topic of music.
He said,

25
00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:40.720
you like all that old Detroit music?
I go,
yeah man.
I mean,
you,

26
00:01:40.721 --> 00:01:44.880
you Mitch Ryder,
the stooges Mc five.
I mean,

27
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.200
it's kind of the best.
Some of the best music I've ever heard.
I mean,

28
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.530
as far.
And I asked him,
I go,
what is it?
Is something in the water,

29
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.410
what is it with the Michigan guys and guitar tone,

30
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.250
like no one gets tone like you,
uh,

31
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.570
Ron Ashton stooges,
Fred Sonic Smith,
Mc five.

32
00:02:03.571 --> 00:02:06.570
I give you guys,
I mean,
you're so good.
And he said,

33
00:02:06.571 --> 00:02:09.780
you gotta we gotta hang out sometime and we'll just talk about music.
I want,

34
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.310
I'll do that with you.
So I'll be taking notes.
And he was just telling me,

35
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.360
you know,
like yeah,

36
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.570
he used to hang out at the MC five house and go see the stooges.
I'm like,

37
00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:20.880
you're killing me cause this is like,
you know,
I,

38
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.480
that would have been heaven for me to see those bands like back in 1969 or

39
00:02:26.821 --> 00:02:28.680
whatever.
Did you,
when did you know him?

40
00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:32.130
Did you know him back in the day or did you only to recently as a punter,

41
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.370
I would go see him like in high school and the 1870s you know,

42
00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:36.450
Carter administration,

43
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.730
I'd go see him at play in my local arena in Washington DC in a place called the

44
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.990
Capitol Center in Largo,
Maryland.
And he was as good as rock and roll gets.

45
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.270
I mean it was,
I saw the,
the double I've guns old lineup and like forget it.

46
00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:56.220
It was like two and a half hours of just getting beat up by music.

47
00:02:56.221 --> 00:02:58.530
It was fantastic.
And to this day,

48
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.260
it's still a high watermark as far as the gigs.

49
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.890
And in the 90s I met him on politically incorrect Bill Maher and I said,

50
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.660
hey man,
I'm a big fan.
And he gave me a bow hunting catalog.
I'm like,

51
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:18.430
well thanks.
You know,
for his whack master,
right.
You know,

52
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.680
you get the croquet mallet and the,
anyway,
I kept it.

53
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.100
I told I'm a fan.
And then I met him years later,
uh,

54
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.380
and I do this radio show,

55
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:33.790
like Saint Patrick's Day in 1997 to crassly promote my next record.

56
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.640
And I said,
we met years ago and,

57
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.220
and we got to talking for like a couple of hours and we,

58
00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:42.340
it was just about music and I played him some of my new record,

59
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:45.760
which you really liked.
And he,
between the commercial breaks,

60
00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:47.350
he was like playing riffs for me.

61
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:50.680
We had a little headphone amp and he was sitting across from me on a stool

62
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.590
playing.
And I'm like,
this is pretty cool.

63
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.140
And so that's the kind of relationship I have with him where I,
you know,

64
00:03:59.141 --> 00:04:01.060
you read some of the things he says,
you're like,
okay,

65
00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:05.890
that's really hard to take and but those records,
you know,

66
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:07.240
they're just so good to me.

67
00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:12.241
And I saw him play in 2000 opening for kiss 2001 somewhere in there and he was

68
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.960
great.
Great.
The tone,
the playing just fantastic.

69
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.150
And so he's just an interesting a bunch of guys,
a bunch of guys,

70
00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:25.990
you know what I mean?
Cause like he can finish a sentence.
He's not,
he's not,

71
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.020
he's not stupid.
He's hilarious.

72
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.030
He has a steel trap memory.
But then he'll just say like,

73
00:04:33.031 --> 00:04:35.980
you know the Obama's as subhuman Mongrel,
like man,

74
00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:40.270
you don't need to talk like that because there's people you will inspire to

75
00:04:40.271 --> 00:04:44.110
punch some black guy in the parking lot for no reason.

76
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.320
Like something bad could happen if you talk like that to the millions of people

77
00:04:49.361 --> 00:04:52.930
who love you.
Like someone will get that message and they'll go south with it.

78
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.740
And when you're in that position,
I don't believe in self censorship,

79
00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.000
but I think you should be careful of what you say.

80
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.680
I think there's some merit in having some control of yourself.

81
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.790
And so I don't completely understand the guy,

82
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.100
this currency and outrageousness that's what it is.
And you,

83
00:05:13.101 --> 00:05:15.830
you cash in by being the guy that says things he can't,

84
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.590
I can't believe what he just said.

85
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.250
And then you become the guy that goes places that says things that no one can

86
00:05:21.251 --> 00:05:23.030
believe that you're saying.
You know,
I,

87
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.050
I know that there's some people that's how they get their next book deal or

88
00:05:26.051 --> 00:05:30.850
whatever.
For Myself,
I would never want to trade in that cause my,

89
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.960
my reality coming up through punk rock and all of that is very,

90
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:38.560
very immediate in that I don't say anything about anybody

91
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.870
without expecting them to hear it.
And with me turning the next corner,

92
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.070
like going to my car and your parking lot and having that person waiting for me

93
00:05:48.071 --> 00:05:52.790
at the car saying,
Hey,
you said this,
and having the meal to hold it up on a,

94
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:53.920
on a tablet and say,

95
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.490
and so I watch what I say because in my mind I answer,

96
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.770
I will have to answer to all of it.

97
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.010
And so I would never say something where someone going to really quell.

98
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:10.160
Today's a day we're going to see who can kick,
who says ass.

99
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.440
Because you know men have this wrong idea that they can't be beat.

100
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.910
Are you kidding?
Anyone could get knocked on her ass.
You think you're tough.

101
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.010
There's always,
you know,
you're in the business of tough guys.

102
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.230
There's always a tougher guy around the corner,
the tougher guy.

103
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:25.910
But more than that,
it's like you don't,

104
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.030
most of the conflict that you get and when you talking shit about somebody,

105
00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:32.750
like someone like you or I can do an interview and talk shit about someone and

106
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:34.820
it didn't go public and you don't think twice about it.

107
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.270
But then now it extends to social media.

108
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.060
Cause actually anybody could do it at any time.
And it just seems so easy to do.

109
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.470
But I always try to think if that person was in front of me,

110
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.160
how's that treat it?
And if I would,
if I would say,
fuck this guy,

111
00:06:49.161 --> 00:06:51.220
like when he's in front of me,
then this is,

112
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.230
I have a real problem with this person.
It's a real bad.

113
00:06:54.231 --> 00:06:58.790
But I would always wait until I was in front of that person and I have waited

114
00:06:58.791 --> 00:07:00.650
and bided my time with people I don't like.

115
00:07:00.651 --> 00:07:04.730
And you get into a conversation and all I have said very calmly,

116
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.380
I think you're a ridiculous person.
I think you're a standing,
walking,

117
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.330
talking billboard for cowardice.

118
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.870
Sometimes people need to hear that too because sometimes people don't hear that.

119
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:19.770
They don't hear that from someone.
I'm not going to help the guy,
but believe me.

120
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.940
But I waited until we were there.

121
00:07:22.941 --> 00:07:27.200
The only people I'll rip on our politicians,

122
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:32.200
like some member of Congress,
I think is just an inactive waste of food.
Um,

123
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.400
that'll say anywhere hoping it'll bring him to me.

124
00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:41.300
So I can say it to his or her face,
but for the most part,

125
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:46.750
the way I was brought up in the world of music and the street is if you say

126
00:07:47.751 --> 00:07:52.250
something,
that guy will be lining you up for a broken jaw.

127
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:53.630
So you better mean it.

128
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:59.080
But maybe just wait until you guys are in a room and see what you really want to

129
00:07:59.241 --> 00:07:59.810
say.

130
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:04.810
Cause Sniping from a windowless room from somewhere or being a a keyboard

131
00:08:07.011 --> 00:08:11.450
activists.
Eh,
that's not,
that doesn't mean much to me.

132
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:16.430
Yeah.
I think you know,
ted is the spokesperson for the right in,

133
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:20.010
in that he's this contrast in so many ways.

134
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:23.210
He's this wild and it used to be long hair.
He doesn't have long hair anymore,

135
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:27.830
but long haired guitar player from Michigan,
I mean he's Ted Nugent.

136
00:08:27.831 --> 00:08:30.750
He should be this,
he should be a drug user or something.
Right.

137
00:08:30.751 --> 00:08:33.980
He should be on tour all the time.
But he's the opposite.
He was like,

138
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:38.510
doesn't do any drugs,
doesn't drink.
And he's super right wing and he supports,

139
00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:43.280
you know,
the second amendment and guns and he,
there's,
he's in this group.

140
00:08:43.281 --> 00:08:47.120
Have any as some very strong beliefs that he really does hold in that group,

141
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:51.470
but then comes the outrageous stuff that he says and you would get a

142
00:08:51.471 --> 00:08:54.230
mischaracterization of him because of some of the things he says.

143
00:08:54.231 --> 00:08:58.330
But if you meet like in person,
person,
a person,
he's a great guy.
Yeah,

144
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:02.010
I talked to him all the time that texting each other only been my experience

145
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:02.121
with,

146
00:09:02.121 --> 00:09:07.121
he's a great guy is I've had really cool conversations with him and I'm a hyper

147
00:09:07.531 --> 00:09:08.460
fan of the records.

148
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.450
I mean it's Gospel to me that those records are in my DNA and I don't effect,

149
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.170
I'm with you and that I don't know what fuels those and I just don't get it.

150
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.470
I'm not here to rip on him.
I just honestly do not,

151
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.200
I can't reconcile the conversations.

152
00:09:22.201 --> 00:09:27.201
I had re super friendly and happy that you're a fan of the guy and then you,

153
00:09:27.481 --> 00:09:31.950
you watched some things,
he says,
uh,
you know,
on some stage somewhere you're like,

154
00:09:31.951 --> 00:09:36.540
wow,
that's,
that's as bummed that my whole evening that's like,

155
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.890
yeah,
okay.
Like that's you,
it's the first amendment.
Go do your thing.
But like,

156
00:09:40.891 --> 00:09:41.550
wow,
that's.
