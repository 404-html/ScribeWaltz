00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.260
You should have AOC on Alexandra.

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.610
Hug Her and I've gone back and forth on Twitter.
Yeah,

3
00:00:05.611 --> 00:00:08.610
that would be really interesting to listen to us.
She's so young.

4
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.820
I'm so interested in how she's 28 years old.
I mean that's amazing.
The whole a,

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.940
she's just fascinating.
You should have her on.

6
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.090
How about when she was getting a hard time because a,

7
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.600
they found a video like they thought they were going to get her video college

8
00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:25.380
dancing.
Yeah,
but you know what?
Everyone loved that video.

9
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.330
The whole narrative that like some random person on Twitter put that video out.

10
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.680
Right.
But the point is they,

11
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.400
they did it because they thought they were going to shame her.
They're idiots.

12
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.570
But how funny is that?

13
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.980
They thought it was the most charming thing in the entire world.

14
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.200
Plays anyone who did not love her already fell in love with him.

15
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.250
That's what had accomplished.

16
00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:48.600
And then her response to that was her doing a little dance.
She's a genius.

17
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:51.210
She's a social media genius.
The question is,
does she,

18
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.100
do her ideas stand up at all?
Well,
she'd be interesting to hear.
Does can evolve.

19
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.060
But what she has,

20
00:00:57.061 --> 00:01:00.300
it's unique and she's real and she seems to be a really good person.

21
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.230
She seems to be a good person.
Now,
whether or not I agree with her tax policy,

22
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:06.660
I'm not an economist.
I'm a fucking moron.
Okay.

23
00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:10.020
I don't know anything about economics.
I really don't.

24
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.710
I mean you should have her arm,
semicolon
are there.
However,

25
00:01:14.711 --> 00:01:18.200
on PR just,
I just want to know about her as a person for my,

26
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.970
my thoughts on politicians is you can hire a economist,
you could listen to them,

27
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.020
you could talk to them,

28
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.370
but we really need is people that have the right idea as far as we're a human

29
00:01:27.371 --> 00:01:31.360
should go the way we should behave,
the way we should treat each other.
This,

30
00:01:31.361 --> 00:01:35.710
this overwhelming need for community that we all share.

31
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.510
We have to,
we have to pull this thing together and we have to be,

32
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.630
we have to look at each other as a community and that's lacking.

33
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.050
And the people that are polarizing both on the left and the right,

34
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.380
why they don't want to look at it that way.
They don't.

35
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.570
They want to look at people and say,
Hey,

36
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.650
you will never get better like that 16 year old kid.
No need to ever forgive him.

37
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.580
This kind of crazy talk,
whether it's from the right or from the left,

38
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.300
is what we really need to stomp out.
We need to stop.

39
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.050
We need to be nicer to each other.
We need to figure out,
we don't have time.

40
00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.520
We're not going to live long.

41
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.420
If you're 50 years old and this is your idea of the world,
like,
fuck man,

42
00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:15.310
you're halfway done and you're in it.
You're an idiot.

43
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.910
You're looking at shit completely wrong and you're halfway done with this trip.

44
00:02:18.911 --> 00:02:19.920
If everything goes perfect,
right.
