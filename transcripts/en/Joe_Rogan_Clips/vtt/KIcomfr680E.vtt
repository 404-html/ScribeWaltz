1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.180
Now you,
you're ever stopped?
Yeah.
Your first team all fanny pack.
Damn.

2
00:00:03.181 --> 00:00:07.980
No deep to labs going off up and slammed the shit out of him.
Yeah.
No,

3
00:00:07.981 --> 00:00:12.510
he's good man.
Nor Dean's very good.
I never stopped with the fanny pack.
No,

4
00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:15.660
you just ride through it even.
Yeah.
People are like to chose fanny pack and like,

5
00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:20.640
I know man.
It's his thing.
There's a shit on.

6
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.950
Yeah.
I saw the shit out of him.
I'm always out of stock.

7
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.250
My boy wants one bad hire.
I made.com we were at Disneyland.

8
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.900
Are we close to MMA and the Olympics?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Holy Shit.

9
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.350
They're working on it.
Yeah,
they're trying.
Can you imagine that?
Well,
it would be.

10
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.770
I can't imagine.
It would be amazing now with Russia,
just when all the belts are,

11
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.340
they would about,
we had some chickens,
man fucking situation.
I mean,

12
00:00:44.341 --> 00:00:48.870
Russia would be tough,
man.
It,
it really depends entirely on drug testing,

13
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.770
but they'll figure it out.
I mean,
Russians when it comes,
you know,

14
00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:54.060
boxed and combat sports.

15
00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:58.350
Russia is really pretty fucking Dagestan be considered Russia.

16
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.870
But the thing is though is what I was putting it under the same banner.

17
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.970
But the thing is,
what would happen is if it did become huge in the Olympics,

18
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.320
then people would realize like,

19
00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:12.321
you know how guys like Floyd Mayweather and so many different professional

20
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:17.130
boxers got their start as Olympic gold medalist and then went on to become these

21
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:20.190
huge superstars in boxing.
Lama Chenko is another good example.

22
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.990
When you have a real great amateur background,
people get super amped up.

23
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.570
Gopro,
Andre Ward.
Yeah.
Anthony.
Joshua.
Yup.

24
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.610
You get super amped up about seeing those guys go pro in America.

25
00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:35.900
It's a little different though for the reason when it comes to boxing.
Yeah.

26
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.990
Because we liked the other can we used to with mark Breland remember those days

27
00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:42.490
with Tyrrell pigs?
We used to love it.
Yeah.

28
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.720
We used to love it when a guy was a Olympic gold medal.
Pernell Whitaker,

29
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.160
you know,
uh,
Ray Mercer [inaudible] Andre Ward.
But it's still,
you know,

30
00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:55.020
and he look at this leg lock
Deontay wilder has a bronze medal.

31
00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:59.730
This was shamed because he started sad,
very boxed in like total one.
Oh Shit.

32
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.170
Anytime you hit them double outside ashes and MMA,
they're risky.
