Trey,
my daddy Joe Rogan podcast by night,
all day.

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.710
That's what I know them.
Then you can't lie to me.

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.740
There's nothing you're going to lie to me about because if you lie to me,

4
00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:12.060
I'm gonna see you on Monday,
idiot,

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.510
and we're going to see what you're made up anyway.
I mean,

6
00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:18.630
without even knowing what they're made of,
you'll know their lines,

7
00:00:18.631 --> 00:00:20.790
but it's different when you fight somebody,

8
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.500
you literally know what they're made of.

9
00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:27.060
When you see the look in their eye and they say what they say and they do what

10
00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:27.451
they do,

11
00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:29.970
and then they go and they fight and they don't say what they say and they don't

12
00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:32.040
do what they do.
And that's just fighting.

13
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.040
And that's what's so refreshing about it to me.
Yeah.

14
00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:38.310
Well the psychological aspect of it,
I mean,
you know,
well,

15
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:43.311
who was it that said this fighting is 90% mental and the other 10% in your head?

16
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.910
I forgot who said that.
I remember either,
but I heard it.
That's a great quote.

17
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.940
I remember who said it,
but I read it.
I believe it with all my heart.

18
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.090
There's so many people out there,
there's so incredibly physically talented.

19
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.270
And how many Jim assassins do you know that for whatever reason they just can't

20
00:00:59.911 --> 00:01:04.260
put it together when the referee says fine or are you ready finery ready to go?

21
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.010
They just are a fraction of who they really are.

22
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.150
Just really break down and think about what happens to the ones that do make it

23
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.440
and then have to deal with the media and uh,
opinions.

24
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.450
And I really feel like athletes,
the biggest hurdle is effect.

25
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.170
That we're willing to actually just get up there and say we might when we might

26
00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:28.560
lose.
And just put that out there and say,
are you willing to,

27
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.330
to put yourself out there like that.

28
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.810
Are you willing to embarrass yourself if you do lose,

29
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.020
are you willing to deal with the media?

30
00:01:37.021 --> 00:01:42.021
If you win for 10 years straight and then lose and then now you're the worst guy

31
00:01:42.691 --> 00:01:46.050
that's ever been seen in the sport or the worst female that's ever been seen the

32
00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:49.590
sport,
you didn't even belong there.
Are you able to deal with that?

33
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.830
That's the question.
That's what being an athlete is not,

34
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.760
well those would be an fighter being different strains to basketball game.

35
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.480
It's true.

36
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.240
You lose a basketball game and people might think you're a fucking loser or a

37
00:02:00.241 --> 00:02:04.920
scrub,
but it's nothing like the shit that I see fighters face online.
No,
I mean,

38
00:02:04.921 --> 00:02:05.640
just look at,

39
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.640
I gotta bring Ronda Rousey up because it's heartbreaking for me as an athlete.

40
00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:15.250
I know what she's feeling,
I know what she's going through.
And um,

41
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.400
as a female it's even on another level,
I can't really imagine that.
I just,

42
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.070
it's a different level of scrutiny I would imagine.
But um,

43
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.020
it's just,
it shows how hard it is to deal with this man like the,

44
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.380
the ups and downs because the downs hit hard just as hard as it out to hit and

45
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.830
you gotta be ready and there can't be any separation and who you are with a win

46
00:02:37.831 --> 00:02:39.090
and a loss.
Because if there is,

47
00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:43.950
it's going to show and you gotta be who you are and not be solely connected to

48
00:02:43.951 --> 00:02:47.670
fighting as your whole being.
Otherwise you're over when you,
when it,

49
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.120
when it ends.
Right.

50
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.260
That was something about the Ronda Rousey promos that I always felt like I just,

51
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.630
I didn't like hearing it.
Like she was like,

52
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.180
I gotta get back to fighting because it's the most important thing and it's a

53
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:03.550
thing that I can be best in the world.
And I was like,
Ooh,

54
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.680
I actually like hearing that studio.
I do.
And the reason is,

55
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.690
it's such a lesson if you really listening in between the lines to the issue of

56
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:15.010
the world.
And that's just my opinion.

57
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.610
We're all putting so much into this one thing and we think that that is our

58
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:22.450
everything when really if she,
Eh,
Eh,
it sounds cheesy,

59
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:26.230
but if you put all that energy towards loving yourself and not the fight career,

60
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.490
the fight career will still be there just as heavy as it is.
Right.
You know?

61
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:35.080
So what I mean is she's using the fighting as her identity with that

62
00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:37.150
championship belt.
She is Ronda Rousey,

63
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:40.900
the Ronda Rousey without the championship belt.
We don't know who she is.

64
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:44.740
She won't come out.
So who are you?
Unless you're winning?

65
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.141
We don't know.

66
00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:51.310
Do you know you're counting on that belt to know who you are now and that's,

67
00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:55.420
that was my biggest point.
That was a hurdle I ran into when I lost my belt.

68
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.930
I didn't know who I was anymore,
and that's how I knew this.

69
00:03:58.931 --> 00:04:00.580
That's how I figured out what my issues were.

70
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.200
<v 1>[inaudible]
yeah.</v>
