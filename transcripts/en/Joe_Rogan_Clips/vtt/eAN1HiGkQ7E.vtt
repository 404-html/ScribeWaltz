1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.640
A hugely significant thing,

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.460
but I also think about it because of podcasts,

3
00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:10.461
because podcasts are in a similar way that just no one saw it coming and the

4
00:00:11.191 --> 00:00:14.580
people that are involved in it are like,
what the fuck are we doing?
Like me,

5
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.120
I'm like,
what am I doing?
Like what is this like for me?
It's like,
Ooh boy,

6
00:00:19.121 --> 00:00:23.490
I get to talk to guys like Ben Greenfield and,
and Jonathan Haidt and all that,

7
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.250
all these different people and the learned some stuff.

8
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.430
And I've have clearly learned way more from doing this podcast than I ever would

9
00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:35.550
have learned without it.
No doubt about it,
unquestionably.
But I didn't,

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.200
I didn't fucking plan this.

11
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.440
So now all of a sudden there's this a signal that I'm sending out to millions

12
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.810
and millions of people and then people like,
well,
you have a responsibility.

13
00:00:45.811 --> 00:00:48.150
I'm like,
oh great.
Well I didn't want that.

14
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.970
I didn't want to responsibility to what,
what I distributed.

15
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.650
I just want it to be able to have a freak show.

16
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.200
Just talk to people like whatever.
You know,

17
00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:59.310
like there's certain people that will have on whether it's Alex Jones or anyone

18
00:00:59.311 --> 00:01:01.710
that's controversial where people would get fucking mad,

19
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.340
why are you giving this person a platform?
I go,
okay,
hmm.

20
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.070
I didn't think about it that way and I don't think that's what I'm doing.

21
00:01:08.071 --> 00:01:10.400
I think I'm talking to people and you can listen.
Yeah,

22
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.050
but it's giving that person a platform because they're saying,
well no,

23
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:15.270
they'll tone down there like Milo Yiannopoulos.

24
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.650
That was one of the arguments people gave me.

25
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:20.280
Like he toned down his platform when he was on your show so you could get more

26
00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:24.990
people to pay attention to him.
Like okay.
But he also talked about he,

27
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.760
he,
that was one of the reasons why he was exposed was my show because he talked

28
00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:34.761
about that it's okay to have sex with underage boys if they're gay because

29
00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:38.150
there's like a mentor relationship between the older gay man,

30
00:01:38.151 --> 00:01:40.440
the young and people like what the fuck are you talking about?

31
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.420
And that was a big part of why he's kind of been removed from the public

32
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:46.740
conversation.
There was,

33
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.160
there was one of the thing and then there's the discussion like,

34
00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:50.971
well what does that,

35
00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:54.990
what is removing someone from the public conversation if someone is very popular

36
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.720
and they have all these people that like to listen to them,

37
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.420
like what is the responsibility of these platforms,

38
00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:03.060
whether it's youtube or Twitter or,
or anyone.

39
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.920
Like what is their responsibility and to decide whether or not someone should or

40
00:02:07.921 --> 00:02:09.450
shouldn't be able to speak.

41
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.410
And this is a thing that I've been struggling with and I've been,

42
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.010
I bounced around inside my own head and I see that you guys struggle with it and

43
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.000
pretty much everyone does.
Youtube does and it's um,
it,

44
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.290
it is a hugely significant discussion that is left to a very relatively small

45
00:02:30.571 --> 00:02:31.404
amount of people.

46
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.000
And this is why this discussion of what is social media,

47
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.720
is it something that everybody has a right to or is it something that should be

48
00:02:39.721 --> 00:02:44.721
restricted to only people that are willing to behave and carry themselves in a

49
00:02:45.691 --> 00:02:50.310
certain way?
I believe it's something that everyone has a right to,

50
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.640
everyone has a right to,
but you still banned people.
Like,
say,
like,

51
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.630
like Alex Jones,
you guys were the last guys to keep Alex Jones on the platform.

52
00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.090
You were the last ones.
Yeah.

53
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.790
And I believe you hung in there until he started harassing you personally,
right?

54
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.840
<v 1>No,
no.
He,
he did not do your house.
He begged.
He,</v>

55
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:12.160
uh,
you know,
he,
he did very different things on our platform versus the others.

56
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.060
So we saw this domino effect over a weekend of one platform,

57
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.110
uh,
banning him.
And then another,
another,
another very,
very quick succession.

58
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.330
And,
you know,

59
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.380
people I think would have assumed that we would just have followed suit,

60
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:32.710
but he didn't violate our terms of service.
Right.

61
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.570
And afterwards he did.
And we have,

62
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.010
you know,
we have a,
we have a policy and if,
if,
uh,
you know,
the,

63
00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:44.950
there was a violation,
we take a enforcement actions.

64
00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:49.720
One might be asking,
uh,
the account holder to delete the tweet.
Another might be,

65
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.910
um,
a temporary suspension.
Another might be a permanent suspension.
So,

66
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.360
<v 0>well,</v>

67
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.520
you saying let's a use in terms of like him saying that Sandy Hook was fake.

68
00:03:59.521 --> 00:04:02.670
He did not say that on the platform.
He did not say that on Twitter.

69
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.110
He only said that on his show.

70
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.830
<v 1>I Dunno.
I Dunno all the mediums he set it in.
What did he do?</v>

71
00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:09.990
What we're looking at is the,
is the,

72
00:04:09.991 --> 00:04:13.760
is a conduct and what he did on our platforms.

73
00:04:13.761 --> 00:04:15.720
So what did he do on your platform that was like,

74
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.610
that you all were in agreement that this is enough?
Uh,
I'm not,

75
00:04:20.611 --> 00:04:24.920
I'm not sure what the,
what the actual like,
you know,
violations were.
Um,

76
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.910
but we have a,
we have a set number of,

77
00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:31.670
of actions and if they keep getting,
if,
if,

78
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.150
if an account keeps a violin in terms of service,

79
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.400
ultimately it leads to permanent suspension.

80
00:04:38.401 --> 00:04:42.180
And when all the other platforms are taking him off,
we didn't find those.

81
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.020
We didn't,
we didn't find those violations and they weren't reported.
But again,

82
00:04:46.021 --> 00:04:50.710
it goes back to a lot of our model people weren't reporting,
uh,

83
00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:55.050
a lot of the tweets that may have been in violation on our service.

84
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.780
Um,
and we don't act on them.
Right.
Um,
like a good

85
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.530
<v 0>instances.
What's going on with Patrion?</v>

86
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.840
I'm sure you're aware of the Sargon of a cod thing.

87
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.980
He did a podcast a long time ago,
uh,

88
00:05:08.981 --> 00:05:13.600
I believe six months or so ago where he used the n word and the way he used it

89
00:05:13.601 --> 00:05:18.220
as a actually against white nationalists.

90
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.410
Um,
and he also said a bunch of other stuff and they decided,

91
00:05:23.411 --> 00:05:28.411
patrion decided that what he said on a podcast was enough for them to remove him

92
00:05:29.381 --> 00:05:33.220
from the platform even though he didn't do anything on their platform.

93
00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.540
That was agregious.

94
00:05:34.541 --> 00:05:38.350
And also they had previously stated that they were all in the judging things

95
00:05:38.351 --> 00:05:40.090
that occurred on their platform.

96
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.480
There's been a giant blow back because of that because people are saying,

97
00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:48.460
well now you're,
you're essentially policing and not based on his actions,

98
00:05:48.461 --> 00:05:52.780
just on concepts and the communication that he was using,

99
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.590
the way he was talking a year.
You are eliminating him from being able to

100
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.510
<v 1>make a living and that you're doing this because he does not fit into your</v>

101
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.360
political paradigm the way you want to view the world.

102
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.220
He have used the world differently.

103
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.880
This is an opportunity for you to eliminate someone who you disagree with.
Yeah,

104
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.030
I mean,
I don't know the nuances of their policy about like we,

105
00:06:15.031 --> 00:06:20.031
we have to pay attention to folks who are using Twitter to shut down the voices

106
00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:24.170
of others.
Right?
That's where it gets weaponized.

107
00:06:24.171 --> 00:06:28.820
And we also have to pay attention to where people are using it that put other

108
00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:31.310
folks in physical danger.

109
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.360
And that is where we need to be most severe.
But otherwise,

110
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.270
everyone has a right to these technologies.

111
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.300
And I think they also have a right to make sure that they have a very simple and

112
00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:48.050
open read of the rules.
And,
and we're not in a great state.

113
00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:51.620
There are rules in our enforcement can be extremely confusing to people.
