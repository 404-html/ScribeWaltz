1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.250
And in the world trade centers I've been accused of covering up and I don't like

2
00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:06.084
that.

3
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:07.383
<v 1>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.710
<v 0>You'd be,
what he does is he's been accused of covering things up of,
uh,</v>

5
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.920
being a bullshitter,
not looking like I'm covering.

6
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.640
A lot of people think
hologram planes.

7
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.580
A lot of people think you're a Zionist shill.

8
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.910
You know that that's the biggest one.
That's the biggest one about Alex Jones.

9
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.120
You know,
I'll be honest with you,
the biggest one people always be,

10
00:00:31.121 --> 00:00:34.510
and you know what?
I always have your back always,
always.
I said,
you know what?

11
00:00:34.511 --> 00:00:37.690
If I didn't know him,
I would prob probably think that shows is the show.

12
00:00:37.691 --> 00:00:42.300
I know you,
you are honestly,
uh,
uh,
uh,

13
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.280
making it a mission in your life to a search for the truth to,
uh,

14
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.490
you're all about liberty.
You're for real.
You want the best for people.

15
00:00:51.491 --> 00:00:55.210
You're looking out for the people's best.
So whether you're right or wrong,

16
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.730
it doesn't matter.
You're right.
You know,
sometimes you're wrong.

17
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.620
But when you only want to say you're old.
So it's hard for me when I'm,

18
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.040
like I'm saying,
I always have your back.

19
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.250
It's hard for me to to think you're like,
some sign the show.
I'm like,

20
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.880
I know what this,
listen man,
people make up rumors about all kinds of people.

21
00:01:09.881 --> 00:01:13.750
They,
they,
they'd come up with ideas that they want to push.
They decide,

22
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.280
you know,
accused someone of doing something really stupid,

23
00:01:18.281 --> 00:01:21.980
like being a part of something that they're not.
Here's the best way.
I,

24
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.740
you your back Alex.
A lot of heat for it,
Michelle.

25
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.050
They think I'm a Zionist now these people,
when you,

26
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.170
when you [inaudible],

27
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.680
when you see conspiracies against you that you know aren't true,

28
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.410
does that make you distrust conspiracies?
Well,

29
00:01:38.411 --> 00:01:43.030
I told you that's the part that's the evolution of you between now and you under

30
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.000
a lot of stuff as lies,
but then people that just say everything's bs,

31
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.210
you got to check it.
There's a lot of that going on.
Right?
Exactly.

32
00:01:50.211 --> 00:01:52.850
So let me try to answer any questions.
Your questions are excellent as well.

33
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.833
And the two go together.

34
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.570
<v 1>I eh,</v>

35
00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.930
<v 0>I mean I grew up in Dallas,</v>

36
00:01:58.931 --> 00:02:03.010
Texas in the eighties and nineties when it was like the murder capital of the

37
00:02:03.011 --> 00:02:07.120
country.
I lived in a middle class area,
but it was still like,
and you know,

38
00:02:07.121 --> 00:02:09.710
I got in fight,
we're rednecks.
I,
you know,
I got in fight with,

39
00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:14.080
with racist Mexicans.
There were racist white people attacking Mexicans.
But I,

40
00:02:14.081 --> 00:02:16.330
I mean I had a big black guys attacking me.

41
00:02:16.331 --> 00:02:19.330
They were like three grades in school and my black friends will say,
man,

42
00:02:19.331 --> 00:02:21.490
you're so cool.
You're not racist.
Even though you know,

43
00:02:21.491 --> 00:02:25.510
my cousin who's 18 or if you're like 14 years attacked you and you know,

44
00:02:25.511 --> 00:02:28.930
that was all just part of a development.
People do tags.

45
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.770
It doesn't care what color their skin is or where they came from.

46
00:02:32.771 --> 00:02:35.890
There's good black people,
there's bad black people,
there's good white people,

47
00:02:35.891 --> 00:02:39.040
there's bad white people,
there's good Mexicans,
there's bad Mexicans,

48
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.650
just good Asians.
There's bad agents,
there's good North Koreans,

49
00:02:41.651 --> 00:02:44.350
there's banner North Koreans.
And I'm standing really simple stuff.

50
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.100
Everybody knows.
But I'll go to a restaurant if they've got good food.

51
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.430
I don't care if it's Ethiopian or if it's Mexican or was chairman.

52
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.880
If the food's good,
the people are nice.
I love it.
Like a women,

53
00:02:54.881 --> 00:02:58.570
like I love black women or white women or Hispanic women.
I Love Mall.

54
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.240
Like if a cool,
I know a bunch of black women that are bitches,

55
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.820
black women that are cool.
What about Swedish bitches?

56
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.550
The point is let's just say I'm,
I'm Super Gay,

57
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.170
but the point is what I'm getting at here though,
not like sweetest.

58
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.930
Let's wrap this up.
Now we eat a wrap it up,
but I've got to make this point.

59
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.190
I don't know what it is.
How is that getting into that?
Oh,
the racism thing.
Oh,

60
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.750
it's not about,
and I want to say something so similar,
but he's like,
yeah,

61
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.150
you just told me grass is green.
Martin Luther King.

62
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:32.830
Like it doesn't matter what color someone is.
It matters what they stand for,

63
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:33.610
what they do.

64
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.610
I go to restaurants that can be owned by Koreans or black people or white

65
00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:42.190
people,
whatever.
If the food's good music.
I love Jimmy Hendricks.

66
00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:44.590
He's a black man.
If the food sucks and I hate it,

67
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.750
but it's not because they're white or because they're Hispanic.
Of course,
Joe,

68
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.430
I don't see going next to a Mexican for three hours,

69
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.170
a 100% believe you totally love Mexicans.
I do to

70
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.620
Mexican food to the show.
We've had a big epic interview.

71
00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:03.680
It's been pretty,
God damn good.
