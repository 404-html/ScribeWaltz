1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.910
The joe rogan experience.
So let's talk about what we were just talking about it.

2
00:00:05.911 --> 00:00:06.580
You were,

3
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.450
you've wrote a book with a guy about drug dealing and he was going to come on

4
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.463
wearing a mask.

5
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.660
<v 1>He wanted to come on wearing a Barack Obama mask.
Actually.
Uh,</v>

6
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.050
it's,
it's actually really funny.
The whole story is really fun.

7
00:00:21.051 --> 00:00:25.520
I'm writing this book.
Um,
oh,
I spilled it too.
Um,

8
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.940
it's called the business secrets of drug dealing.
Uh,

9
00:00:28.941 --> 00:00:33.030
you can find it@businesssecretsofdrugdealing.com.
Um,

10
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.930
and I'm serializing it,
uh,

11
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.960
but basically somebody I knew for ages,
um,

12
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.070
in a completely different capacity,
uh,

13
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.620
sort of came out to me last year and said,
um,
you know,

14
00:00:48.621 --> 00:00:52.640
I've been a high level drug dealer for,
for a long time,
basically my whole life.

15
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.170
And wanted to tell a story about,
uh,
you know,

16
00:00:57.171 --> 00:01:00.580
sort of the whole progression of his life,
what kind of drugs,
uh,

17
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.110
only things that grow out of the ground.
So,
uh,
he started off,
um,
this is,

18
00:01:06.111 --> 00:01:08.690
uh,
this is an African American guy.
Uh,

19
00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:12.710
he started off bleeding or not selling mushrooms.
Uh,
he,

20
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.740
he sort of grew up half in the projects and half an in an upscale suburb.

21
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.030
Uh,
and he in the upscale suburb,
he sold mushrooms,

22
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.320
which she,
uh,

23
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.390
basically got through mail order at a time early in the sort of history of the

24
00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:35.270
Internet when there were some loopholes about things you get spores.
Right?
Yeah.

25
00:01:35.271 --> 00:01:39.470
Well actually you could get the actual really?
Yeah,
yeah.
Wow.

26
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.510
Um,
so he ends up having this whole career.

27
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.920
Uh,
uh,
and he wanted to,

28
00:01:48.921 --> 00:01:53.510
to sort of explain to me what the rules of the game where,
uh,

29
00:01:53.511 --> 00:01:58.220
and do sort of a book version of the 10 Crack Commandments.
Uh,

30
00:01:58.221 --> 00:02:01.730
and so we sat down and,
um,

31
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.760
we couldn't quite figure out how to do it at first,

32
00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:09.761
but we ended up essentially doing a sort of fictionalized version of,

33
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.750
uh,
of his life.
Um,

34
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.670
and the progression is amazing because he,

35
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.030
he goes from being a dealer in all these different parts of the country in

36
00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:27.980
different social spheres.
He's a,
in college,
he deals to rich,
white kids.

37
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:32.330
He deals on the street and,
and,
and you know,
tough urban neighborhoods.

38
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.680
And then ends up sort of in the legal business,
uh,

39
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.420
in this state,
uh,
and lawyer?
No,
no,
no,

40
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.920
no,
no,
no.
He illegal marijuana.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Uh,

41
00:02:45.921 --> 00:02:49.520
and so he's describing that world,
which is not,
um,

42
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.250
there are a lot of misconceptions about it.
Uh,
there,

43
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.080
there are some things about it that are,
um,
not known terribly well.

44
00:02:57.081 --> 00:03:01.820
Like,
you know,
what do you do when you,
uh,
you know,
at a,

45
00:03:01.821 --> 00:03:06.580
at a farm and,
uh,
your crop test dirty,

46
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.780
you know,
with a,
with a contaminant.
Um,
well,
you know,

47
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:13.990
not everybody just throws it away,
you know,
a lot of that stuff ends up,

48
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.460
shipped across country,
goes to other markets.
Uh,

49
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:20.410
and he sorta describes a lot of this,

50
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:25.240
like what kind of contaminants would that be?
Like fungal or like a fungus?

51
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.180
Uh,
something like that.
Uh,
that,
you know,

52
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:31.870
there are labs that basically have to clear,
uh,
you know,
from what I understand,

53
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.280
um,
that have to clear each of the crops.
And,
uh,

54
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:38.040
and there are situations where,
you know,

55
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.020
there's a whole bunch of crop and you've got workers that have to be paid.

56
00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:45.610
And what do you do with it?
And the legal market isn't big enough,

57
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.720
um,
to accommodate all of the stuff that's grown.

58
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.990
And so there's sort of still,
you know,

59
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:57.340
kind of a black market that goes on and he,
he,
he describes this and,
uh,

60
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.110
but even before that,
it's just a fascinating book about,
you know,

61
00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:05.430
all the different things that he learned in the course of his career,

62
00:04:05.431 --> 00:04:06.880
but how to get,
you know,

63
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.860
do the job and not get caught had had a rig,

64
00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:16.000
a load to drive cross country.
How do you do with dummy car?

65
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.280
Um,
you know,
he tells a story about how basically you want four cars,

66
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:25.960
you want the guy in the front seat to be,
to be,
to look like a drug dealer,

67
00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:29.650
have a terrible record,
drive badly,
uh,

68
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.700
basically to attract the police.
Uh,
and the,
you know,

69
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.160
the third car is the load car,
the second car sort of watching to see if there's,

70
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.840
there's cops in either direction.

71
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.190
And then the fourth car is basically driving up,
uh,

72
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.550
behind the load card is sort of preventing anybody from seeing the license
plate.

73
00:04:48.551 --> 00:04:52.310
And that sort of thing.
And so he just talks about all this stuff and it's,
it's,

74
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.250
it's fascinating.
And,
um,

75
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.450
it was a new kind of writing for me because I'd never really done anything

76
00:04:58.451 --> 00:05:01.480
except straight journalism and we sort of had to do it in narrative form.

77
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.180
And so we're,
we're putting it out serially online right now,

78
00:05:04.181 --> 00:05:05.020
which is really cool.

79
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.250
So you did one of those change the names to protect the innocent.
Exactly,
yeah,

80
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.140
yeah.
Or,
or the guilty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But for the most part,

81
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.800
based on facts,
yes,
yes.

82
00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:22.450
The situations where let's just say realistic,
you know?
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.

83
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:27.040
And,
and his,
you know,
the observations were that,
uh,

84
00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:30.970
that he describes are all,
you know,
things that he actually learned.

85
00:05:30.971 --> 00:05:34.410
The situations were,
you know,
relatively close to things that actually happened.

86
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.340
So,
yeah.
That's interesting.
So that's available now.
Yup.
Yup.
Again,
it's,

87
00:05:39.341 --> 00:05:43.100
uh,
uh,
business secrets of drug dealing.com.

88
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.270
It's kind of a new thing.
Aye.
I,
I,
I grew up,

89
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.610
I'm a huge fan of a serialized,
uh,

90
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.620
detective stories.
I was a big fan of like Dashiell Hammett,
Raymond Chandler,

91
00:05:56.621 --> 00:06:01.010
and I loved a black mask magazine,
which was the big pulp,

92
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.850
new our magazine in the twenties and thirties.
And,
um,
you know,

93
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.300
I grew up reading all those stories and I always,
uh,

94
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.360
it was in the back of my mind always that I wanted to try this a and write a

95
00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:18.220
book,
uh,
on a deadline.
So I'm doing this now.

96
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.810
It's a,
it's basically co-written with this,
uh,

97
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.700
anonymous character who can appear with me on shows like this,

98
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:30.110
a anywhere because he asks he's,
he's still not captured.
And,
um,

99
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.840
so is there their warrants out for this guy?
No,

100
00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:37.750
he's never been picked up and arrested.
Never been arrested.
No.
Yeah.

101
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.820
Uh,
it's like a smart dude.
He is a smart dude.

102
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.330
He has a smart dude and some of his employers would be very surprised to know

103
00:06:44.331 --> 00:06:48.110
that he's got a hobby like this.
Um,

104
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.140
uh,
it's funny.
Can I,
you know,
I knew him again.

105
00:06:51.141 --> 00:06:55.340
I knew him for years and didn't have the faintest clue,
uh,
that,

106
00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:00.290
that this was,
this was going on.
So keep a job in order to avoid suspicion.

107
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.220
So the,

108
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.920
the book is actually structured with all these rules.
It's chapter has,
has rules.

109
00:07:06.921 --> 00:07:11.360
And at one of his,
his most important rules is always have a job.

110
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:16.790
Uh,
and he,
it's for a number of reasons.
Number one,

111
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.140
um,
he talks about how when he was young,

112
00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:23.800
he worked at places like,
you know,

113
00:07:23.801 --> 00:07:28.340
a Mariott or Applebee's and he's like,
you know,
if you can serve,

114
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.720
um,

115
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.780
have the patients to serve people at an apple bees and not blow up and scream at

116
00:07:35.331 --> 00:07:39.930
people,
then you won't screw up a package like that.
In other words,
if,

117
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:44.000
if you can have the self discipline to actually get through one of these jobs

118
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.980
and not blow up and be crazy,

119
00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:48.710
then you're going to handle or hindered herself well at a car stop.

120
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.460
That's fascinating.
So he used it almost like as a discipline exercise.

121
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:56.270
He used it as a discipline exercise.
He learned among other things like,

122
00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:01.310
uh,
another one for his rules,
his dress like an off duty is apple piece waiter,

123
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:06.560
right?
Like,
do not dress.
Uh,
and he talks about this,

124
00:08:06.561 --> 00:08:11.450
about how most dealers,
um,
they learn their,
their,

125
00:08:11.451 --> 00:08:16.340
uh,
profession,
uh,
by watching movies.
You know,

126
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.540
there's no,
there's no book out there.
I mean,
there,

127
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.220
it's not like this generation is growing up reading like near the old iceberg

128
00:08:22.221 --> 00:08:25.820
slam or Donald Goines novels or whatever it is.
They're watching,
you know,

129
00:08:25.821 --> 00:08:30.821
the wire or blow a or Ozar canal or whatever it is.

130
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.570
Um,
but dealers very often dressed like dealers,
you can,

131
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.450
you can kind of spot them,
you know,
and he says,

132
00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:42.230
that's exactly the opposite of what you have to do.
Um,
you know,

133
00:08:42.231 --> 00:08:46.610
where Sperry shoes were boring clothes look like,
you know,
you've,

134
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.010
you're on your way to,
to,
you know,

135
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:53.720
your freshman English class or whatever it is.
Um,

136
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:58.710
and you know,
[inaudible] sound like a nerdy college kid when,

137
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:03.240
when,
uh,
the cops pull you over and all that stuff is a,

138
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:04.860
is sort of central to his,

139
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.850
his whole a worldview about how to avoid getting caught.

140
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:13.980
Wow.
That would be a great book.
It,
I mean,
it is,
it's,
it's,
it's really fun.

141
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:19.170
And you know,
the,
the fact that,
um,
that the,

142
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.920
you know,
the coauthor is actually a person who's pulling this off makes it,

143
00:09:22.921 --> 00:09:26.730
makes it really interesting and it makes it a real challenge to write it too,

144
00:09:26.731 --> 00:09:31.670
because,
um,
you know,
I had to kind of,
uh,

145
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.220
simulate his voice,
uh,

146
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.830
and kind of communicate to people what,

147
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:42.000
what those situations were like and what things look like from his point of
view.

148
00:09:42.001 --> 00:09:46.050
And obviously I'm white and he's African American and that's,
that's tough.
And,

149
00:09:46.051 --> 00:09:49.170
uh,
but you know,
I think it works,
it's kind of a cool story,

150
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.280
but it must've been a juicy,

151
00:09:50.281 --> 00:09:52.680
like when you found the subject and I just felt like,
oh boy,

152
00:09:52.681 --> 00:09:56.910
we got something here.
Oh yeah.
Super Juicy.
Yeah,
no,
it's,
it's,

153
00:09:56.911 --> 00:10:01.330
it's so much fun.
I haven't had this much fun,
like,
fun,
fun writing anything for,

154
00:10:01.331 --> 00:10:06.090
for a long time because,
um,
you know,
most,
most criminal memoirs,

155
00:10:06.091 --> 00:10:10.290
and again,
I grew up a junkie in terms of reading the stuff I love.

156
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:15.650
I love books that are written after the fact by people who were in crime.

157
00:10:16.201 --> 00:10:19.660
You know,
like pappy alm was one of my favorite books growing up.
I mean,
it's a,

158
00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.690
it's an amazing story about not,

159
00:10:21.691 --> 00:10:24.930
not just crime but about prison and what's that like,

160
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:28.560
but they're always written by people after they got caught.
Right.

161
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:33.630
And so there's never that book by the person who's still out there,
uh,

162
00:10:33.631 --> 00:10:38.370
and,
and talking about what al La life is like,
um,

163
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:44.080
successfully,
uh,
still on the other side of the law.
And that,

164
00:10:44.081 --> 00:10:47.940
that part of it is fascinating.
It's just a,
it's a completely new thing.
And,

165
00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:51.650
and he has all these insights that I,
that I would never have thought about.

166
00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.990
Like he,
he talks about how,
um,

167
00:10:55.890 --> 00:11:00.640
there's a thing he calls the hood price.
Like if you,
when you're dealing,
uh,

168
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.010
selling to,
um,
uh,

169
00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:07.410
in black neighborhoods even he charges a higher price.
Uh,

170
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.840
because there's more,

171
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:14.460
there are more problems that you inevitably run into when you're dealing in

172
00:11:14.461 --> 00:11:17.340
those neighborhoods because there was more cops,
which means more lawyers,

173
00:11:17.341 --> 00:11:20.280
which means more security,
which means more attention to detail.

174
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:24.720
When you deal to the rich white kids does this,
nobody's paying attention,

175
00:11:24.721 --> 00:11:29.220
so you just,
there's less overhead,
you know,
in the business.
Uh,

176
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.940
which is,
which is fascinating.
It's,
it's a,
and you know,

177
00:11:32.941 --> 00:11:35.820
he talks to all about this and,
and he,
he has,

178
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:40.350
he spent a lifetime kind of just keeping all this stuff in his head,

179
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:45.300
always wanting to,
to put it down.
And he just got to be too much.

180
00:11:45.301 --> 00:11:47.460
And he just sort of tapped me on the shoulder one day and said,

181
00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:49.380
can we have lunch?
I just want to talk to you about something

182
00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:56.960
before this.
I would say three years.
Wow.
Four years.
Yeah.
Yeah.

183
00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:00.400
That's that easy.
Yeah,
it was,
well,
we had a trust.
You well,

184
00:12:00.401 --> 00:12:05.080
I'm glad we decided to,
did not have him on because he would get busted.
Yeah,

185
00:12:05.081 --> 00:12:08.830
exactly.
Yeah.
Like you can't,

186
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.160
like if you were on something and you had a mask on,
people go,
that's mad tight.

187
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:17.050
You know what I mean?
There'd be somebody listening to him.
He doesn't,

188
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:20.320
maybe he doesn't understand that there's millions of people listening.

189
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.450
I didn't totally agree with you.
It's of those people would go,
that's whatever.

190
00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.780
Right.
That's Mike.
That's John.
Whatever his name is,
they would get it.
Even the,

191
00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:31.690
even the Unabomber got caught and he only talked to like two people.

192
00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:36.370
<v 2>Okay.</v>
