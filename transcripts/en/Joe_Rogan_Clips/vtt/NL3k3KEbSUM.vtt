WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.530
The joe rogan experience.
Yeah.
That see that.

2
00:00:04.531 --> 00:00:08.940
See that that is a representation of capitalism.
Yeah.
Right,
right.

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.600
It is exactly what it is.
It is capitalism inside of communism.
Yeah.
Yeah.

4
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.420
No,
but key people poor and hungry and like the best in the world.

5
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.140
The Best I can do is get three meals a day.
Right.
And live in a better place.

6
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.300
That's
how we got po.
We got political.
Yeah.

7
00:00:27.301 --> 00:00:31.170
But it is political and it,
you know,
people need motivation.

8
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.300
They need incentive for their actions.

9
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.110
People that think socialism is a good idea,
have never accomplished anything.

10
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.750
There's no way you've competed.
There's no way.

11
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.320
If you're a competitor and you understand the benefit and the value of

12
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:45.750
competition,
I'm not talking about capitalism competitive,

13
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.750
I'm talking about just actual competitive in anything.

14
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.980
Anything where you're trying to get a position and it's a very difficult

15
00:00:52.981 --> 00:00:54.870
position.
So you want to work harder than the other people around.

16
00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:59.510
You know about merit based performance.
Like you know,
like you,

17
00:00:59.511 --> 00:00:59.911
you should,

18
00:00:59.911 --> 00:01:04.911
you should achieve based on your merit based on what you have actually shown to

19
00:01:05.371 --> 00:01:08.580
like how much work you've put in.
What you've accomplished,

20
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.930
you should benefit from that.

21
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.050
And the idea that everybody should be paid equally and that everybody should

22
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:16.620
just have,
oh man will just contribute and just uh,
I'll give a little,

23
00:01:16.621 --> 00:01:21.330
you give the little dose fucks never give their share.
They're never good.

24
00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:24.180
They're never the best at what they do.
They never know how to compete.

25
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.300
They just don't.
They just don't.
It's not saying that you,

26
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.350
there's not some aspects of a community where we should have some socialist

27
00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:33.630
ideas.
Like I believe in free education.

28
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.430
I believe that without a doubt our nation as wealthy as it is,

29
00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:41.480
can afford to have better healthcare,
better education.
Yeah.

30
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.200
Those two things I think are gigantic factors in just having a healthy
community.

31
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.460
But if you want a quality of outcome,
you can suck my dick.
That's nonsense.

32
00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:54.510
There's no such thing as equality of outcome because if you have real freedom,

33
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.340
real freedom,
you're always going to have inequality of outcome.

34
00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:02.670
Cause the real freedom is a guy like Jocko wants to get up at four 30 in the

35
00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:06.330
morning and work out every day.
Whereas some people just want to sleep til noon.

36
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.990
I'd rather just lay in bed band.
I like to go to the beach and hang out.
I'm not,

37
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.130
I'm not in a hurry.
I'm not in a rush.
Good.
I hope you enjoy yourself.

38
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.150
There's nothing wrong with that.

39
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.820
But if you want the same amount of monies that mother fuckers up at four 30 in

40
00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:20.220
the morning hustling,
constantly cranking out.

41
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.940
I've got three different things in the air.
Three different things going on.

42
00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:27.470
Projects constantly,
always in the middle of something.
Always pushing,

43
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.960
always trying to improve.
Always look at himself,
always being self critical,

44
00:02:30.961 --> 00:02:33.870
always analyzing what do I have to do to get better?
And you're not,

45
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.320
but you want the same outcome for you.

46
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.820
I think I completely agree with that.
I feel like there's this,

47
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.110
the world,
oh,

48
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.310
especially the country is in the best place when there are more people in the

49
00:02:47.311 --> 00:02:50.490
middle,
when they're,
when they're,
when,
when there's these extremes.

50
00:02:50.491 --> 00:02:52.620
And I feel like the Pete,
that people that were in the middle,

51
00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:57.060
they've somehow been dragged further out to these extremes because yeah,
having,

52
00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.160
um,
like going

53
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.000
<v 1>far right with some things,
right.
Um,
no,
you don't get anything.</v>

54
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.720
You don't get this unless you work for it.
And you're like,
yeah,
absolutely.
100%.

55
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:11.560
And,
and,
and,
but like some,
some of the things that go along with that.
Yeah.

56
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:14.880
But then this,
everybody gets a trophy every like,
no,
everybody's in,

57
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.540
it doesn't get a trophy there.
There is like,

58
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.660
you should get a trophy if you are able to compete to the level that deserve,

59
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:24.320
that's deserving of a trophy and that's it.
Right?

60
00:03:24.321 --> 00:03:27.010
Like everybody shouldn't get one.
You lost.

61
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.250
You shouldn't get the same thing that the guy that won got you.

62
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:33.790
Did well and you lost a need and there's a big competition with a big group and

63
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:36.880
you did better than some of them.
Yeah.
Maybe you get some of the,
some of the pie,

64
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.490
but like this whole thing of,
yeah,
everybody's equal.
I,
I,

65
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.470
I disagree,
I feel like,
but I feel like there's,

66
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.610
there's aspects of everything that should be everywhere.
So when I say that,

67
00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:51.970
what I mean is like capitalism,
like we saw,

68
00:03:51.971 --> 00:03:55.750
we saw capitalism inside communism in that example,
right?
Well,

69
00:03:55.751 --> 00:04:00.160
inside capitalism there should be some,
some,
some socialism like,
like,
um,

70
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.040
like let's look at the major league baseball,
right?
The Yankees,
they,

71
00:04:05.041 --> 00:04:07.420
they're in the playoffs every year because they can afford,

72
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.890
they can afford to buy the best player.
But like,
look at,
look at Green Bay,

73
00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:15.460
Wisconsin,
small market team.
They can win a Superbowl because of the,

74
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:19.870
of the revenue share it because of the socialistic revenue sharing inside the

75
00:04:19.871 --> 00:04:24.820
NFL.
You know,
it's,
it's,
it's a weird dynamic where there are things that,

76
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.610
that apply in different situations,

77
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.410
but like people can't compartmentalize and enough so that these things can

78
00:04:32.411 --> 00:04:35.770
happen and we can all make it work out.
Like I feel like,

79
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.510
like you said about healthcare and education.
Um,
yeah.
Health care and education.

80
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.620
We have the funds for those things to be,
to be good across the board.

81
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.290
But why is it that the schools in this,

82
00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:51.010
in this rich area always better.

83
00:04:51.011 --> 00:04:54.190
They always have the better scores,
but then when you take that same,

84
00:04:54.191 --> 00:04:59.050
you take the same type of um,
effort and you put that somewhere in a poor area,

85
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.350
their scores come up and,
and they can compete,
right?

86
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.330
If they have the same effort from the faculty and the staff and whatnot.
But,

87
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.770
um,
and same thing with like law enforcement,
law enforcement is,
is,

88
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.030
is better in these areas where like,

89
00:05:13.031 --> 00:05:15.730
it's like there's no crime here then this is where all the rich people live and

90
00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:17.410
this,
isn't that right?
Yes.
But like if,

91
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.110
because they also have better law enforcement,
they're a kid.

92
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.010
There are police patrolling that area in a different fashion.
Um,
like it's,

93
00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:26.920
it's this weird thing where it's not equal,

94
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.810
it's not equal and it doesn't like those things should be equal.

95
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.500
But,
but as far as these people live in a poor area now,

96
00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:37.780
and these people are,
they don't,

97
00:05:37.781 --> 00:05:42.280
they have a lot of money because of a family wealth,
because of work ethic.

98
00:05:42.281 --> 00:05:46.360
Because of all of that.
Yeah.
Like every,
but everybody deserves to be safe.

99
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.590
Everybody deserves to have that at the very least.
Right?
So let's,

100
00:05:50.591 --> 00:05:55.180
let's enforce the laws and in patrol and do those things in this area just as

101
00:05:55.181 --> 00:05:58.010
much as we do for this area.
Right.
And put the,

102
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.500
<v 0>put the money into that because that's a community thing.</v>

103
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.880
Now when we're talking about what they have,
they have nice pools.

104
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.100
Will they pay higher taxes and they do this thing.
Okay,
well if you want that,

105
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:10.700
you've now that you,
you're safe enough and your education is where it is.

106
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.630
Let's start reinvested in that community.
You know,
let's not,
let's not get,

107
00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:19.460
get to the point where we can afford to be here.
So we go there,
no let,

108
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.340
we can afford to be there.
And um,
but let's,

109
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:26.210
let's try reinvesting in this community to make this community more like that

110
00:06:26.211 --> 00:06:29.510
one.
But if we have the protections to do that,

111
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:33.100
then I feel more comfortable reinvesting in this community.
Yeah,
it's,

112
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.220
it's a weird,

113
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.460
all these things are all over the place and he got to put them together.
Well,

114
00:06:37.461 --> 00:06:40.850
we don't treat our country as if it's a giant community.
Right?

115
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:43.220
If it was a giant community where everybody's equal,

116
00:06:43.221 --> 00:06:45.740
we would look at all the problem spots and say,
okay,

117
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.900
well there's these crime ridden,

118
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.470
poverty stricken communities that can't seem to catch a break.

119
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.750
So the people that come out of that,
even though we're saying,
hey,
you have a,

120
00:06:54.751 --> 00:06:57.260
there's an open playing field to compete.
That's not true.
Right?

121
00:06:57.261 --> 00:07:00.560
Because they're coming at it with a massive different disadvantage from the jump

122
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:05.300
to education disadvantage and environmental disadvantage in what they see around

123
00:07:05.301 --> 00:07:08.420
them all the time.
They're around a lot of,
I can't catch a break dudes.
Right.

124
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:11.570
And a lot of trap,
lot of criminals,
a lot of bullshit,

125
00:07:11.571 --> 00:07:13.670
a lot of different ways you could go wrong.

126
00:07:13.671 --> 00:07:17.270
A lot of things that could set you down a terrible path in life and it's around

127
00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:18.104
you all the time.

128
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:23.010
And if we tried to engineer society,
so say,
well,

129
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.720
how do we,
how do we have less people that are disadvantaged?

130
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.450
How do we have less losers?
What's the best way?
Well,

131
00:07:29.451 --> 00:07:30.770
you got to go to the problem spots,

132
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:33.830
all the problem spots we should be dumping money in.
And,

133
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.940
and I'm not saying that we shouldn't do anything overseas because I think a lot

134
00:07:37.941 --> 00:07:42.170
of the things that we do overseas probably help and protect us over here.
Yeah.

135
00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:45.290
But there's a lot of shit we don't have to do.
And that shit,

136
00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:47.420
we could take that money and just fix cities.

137
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:52.630
Just go in and throw a ton of money and compassion and education and community

138
00:07:53.271 --> 00:07:56.840
centers and make places safe for people to learn how to be an adult.

139
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:06.870
<v 2>Okay.</v>
