1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.460
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.700
Is any of this all,
all,
all the pressure and the scandal every three weeks.

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.800
Is this a does,
is it weigh on you?
Is it,
is it difficult?

4
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.430
How are you feeling?
Like when,
when all this new thing,
yeah.

5
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.160
It's like,

6
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.760
it's like simultaneously the worst possible thing in the best possible thing

7
00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:28.200
that could happen.
Well,
financially it's been a boom,
right?
Yes.

8
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.030
It's which has areas as a knee.
Oh,
well,
yes.
I mean,
the thing that I've,

9
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.240
I shouldn't say this,
but I'm going to because it's just so,
God damn funny.

10
00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:40.020
I can't help but say that I figured out how to monetize social justice warriors

11
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.980
is what it is.
I know.
It's so funny.
It just can't believe it.
It's other way.

12
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.510
It just,
every time.

13
00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:52.350
I think that while it's just one of the surreal circumstances that characterize

14
00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:52.801
my life,

15
00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:57.801
it's like I'm driving the social justice activists in Canada mad because if they

16
00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:01.200
let me speak,
then I get to speak and then more people support me on patriot.

17
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.990
It's like,
hmm,
that's annoying.
It's like God damn capitalist.

18
00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:07.080
He's make more money off this ideological warfare.
It's like,
okay fine,

19
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.630
let's go protest.
If they go protest me,

20
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.040
then that goes up on Youtube and then my patron account goes way up.

21
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.490
So it's like they don't know what to do.

22
00:01:16.491 --> 00:01:20.430
And so one of the things that keep accusing me,
yeah,
they keep accusing me of uh,

23
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.240
like hauling in the loot.
And I think,
well look,
here's the situation guys.

24
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.740
I give away everything I do online for free.

25
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.750
It's free and people are giving me money.
They're just sending it to me.

26
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.420
I'm not twisting their arm.
I'm not even asking them for it.

27
00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:39.370
Well I guess that's not exactly right cause I set up the Patriot account,

28
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.450
but that's more complicated than it looks that a lot of that was curiosity.

29
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.100
And I thought,
well,
I could increase the production quality of my online videos.

30
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.370
It was also the potential of you being removed from the universal there.
Yes.

31
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.750
Well that and that was real life.
Oh yeah.
Oh and yeah,
people wanted that.

32
00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.010
Oh yeah.

33
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.040
They haven't stopped wanting that in October when the Lindsay Shepherd scandal

34
00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:03.960
broke.
And it would look so bad for the left wing media logs,

35
00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:08.961
like 200 University of Toronto community members signed a petition to get me

36
00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:10.920
fired again.

37
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.880
And I was kind of upset about that and this is what my life has been like.

38
00:02:14.881 --> 00:02:18.430
It's so,
my son came over that day and I said,
Jesus,
Julian,
you know,

39
00:02:18.431 --> 00:02:22.560
I'd like 200 people at the faculty member at in at the University of Toronto,

40
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.370
petitioned the Faculty Association and then they sent in a petition to the

41
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:29.880
administration to get me fired.
It was the faculty association.
That's my union.

42
00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:33.660
They didn't even contact me and Julian said,
ah,
don't worry about it,
dad.

43
00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:37.080
It was only 200 people and I thought that's where my life is.
Like,

44
00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:42.081
it's like a day where 200 people sign a petition to get me fired as a professor.

45
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.180
My son can come in and say,
well,
that's not so bad.

46
00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:48.870
It's like it's only 200 pizza cheese scales.
God,
that's right.
It's so,

47
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.210
it's so surreal because you could say that online and look what's happening and

48
00:02:55.771 --> 00:03:00.080
then the support would be overwhelming for who knows how many people do

49
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.440
<v 1>you administrate times of that?
Yeah.</v>

50
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.440
<v 0>Yeah,
absolutely.
Well,
in the administration at the University of Toronto,</v>

51
00:03:04.441 --> 00:03:07.080
like they didn't take,
they didn't take it seriously at all,

52
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.840
called helped me remove it.
Didn't cause it

53
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.500
<v 1>any,
didn't even cause a ripple.</v>

54
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.290
Now who are these 200 people and what was their motivation?

55
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.480
<v 0>Oh,
well they're hard to say what their motivations are.
Not very happy.</v>

56
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.700
<v 1>The read the transcript or listen to those recordings.
Yup.</v>

57
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.680
How could they possibly be against you based on that?

58
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.920
<v 0>Oh,
because they think that the people who,
who,</v>

59
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.340
who conducted the inquisition were right.
Well,
that's madness.

60
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.250
Oh yes.
But it look,
look,
I mean,

61
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:39.310
I mean there's formally like 20 members of Pim,

62
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:42.820
lots and Rambo counters faculty that was communications at Wilfrid.

63
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:44.800
Laurier wrote a letter supporting them.

64
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.330
So that's why it's not an isolated incident.
It's like,
no,
no.

65
00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:52.690
They thought that what they were doing was right.
It's mass hysteria.
Yep.

66
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.790
While there is an element of that that's for sure.

67
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.700
<v 1>And there's certainly a,
again,
I hate to bring this term up again,</v>

68
00:03:57.701 --> 00:04:01.420
but this toxic tribalism thing and it's like they are there supporting their own

69
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.770
and they understand that their own ideologies have been completely connected to

70
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:09.640
the same type of group think that's going against Lindsay Shepherd.

71
00:04:09.641 --> 00:04:13.450
And that meeting when they tried to paint her as a radical right winger and does

72
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:16.570
her well,
she certainly isn't.
Of course not.
And neither of you,

73
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.360
I mean the whole thing is ridiculous and you're not outright,

74
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.930
you're not a neo Nazi.
You're not.
I've,

75
00:04:20.931 --> 00:04:25.750
I've read a lot of crazy things about you and knowing you personally seeing this

76
00:04:25.751 --> 00:04:28.180
stuff,
I'm like,
this is,
this is a fascinating

77
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.820
<v 0>Tommy,
that's for sure.
That's for sure.
Yeah.
And it's been,
well,
it's been crazily,</v>

78
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.380
well,
I'm,
what would I say,
crazily stressful.
It's,

79
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.180
it's the best way to describe it is surreal.
Yeah.
Like I'm,

80
00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:45.000
it's like I stepped outside myself.
I can't,

81
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.950
I can't put this in a box.
I don't know what to make of it.

82
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.520
I don't know what to make of the channel four interview.
You know?
It's like,

83
00:04:53.521 --> 00:04:58.100
what the hell?
Really?
It's,
it's,
it's crazy.
But yeah,

84
00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.810
<v 1>it's,
it's this,</v>

85
00:04:59.811 --> 00:05:03.320
these conversations are so limited by what you were saying before that they're

86
00:05:03.321 --> 00:05:05.300
trying to get this five minute sound bite in,

87
00:05:05.301 --> 00:05:08.960
and that's what television has become.
Yeah.
It's a dying media.
Yeah.

88
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.340
It doesn't make any sense.

89
00:05:10.341 --> 00:05:13.700
It doesn't make any sense to sandwich these commercials in every 15 minutes or

90
00:05:13.701 --> 00:05:15.740
whatever they do.
None of it makes any sense.

91
00:05:15.741 --> 00:05:18.710
It's an archaic way of communicating ideas.

92
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.130
<v 0>Yeah.
Well,
I think that is part of it too,</v>

93
00:05:21.131 --> 00:05:25.600
is that like I happened to catch a technological wave.
Well,
like you did,

94
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.370
you know?
Yeah.
I mean,
they're,

95
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.360
they're television offers nothing over youtube.

96
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.980
Nothing you can do,
do offers everything to my TV.
Yeah.
Well,

97
00:05:35.981 --> 00:05:40.060
exactly.
Yeah.
And then there's no space requirements on youtube,

98
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.680
so you don't have to do this,

99
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.960
twist the complex event into a short sound bite and entertain everyone.
Right.

100
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.310
And it turns out too,
that there's this huge audience online for actual content,

101
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.060
like just genuine conversation.

102
00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.110
Yeah.
