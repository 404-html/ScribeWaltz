00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.300
What is it like for you to watch boxing these days?

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.290
It's just not my life anymore.
Do you don't watch it at all.

3
00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:09.180
It did you watch Tyson fury?
Deontay wilder.

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.300
I was in the air flying when they were fighting.
Oh really?

5
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.290
Did you didn't watch it?
The highlights or anything for some of the highlights?

6
00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:21.150
Yeah.
How crazy is Deontay?
Wilder is power.
Good stuff.
Crazy rights.

7
00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:23.880
Cause he's built so strange.
It's totally how incredible.

8
00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:27.630
How incredible with Peyton Chore.
Incredible.
Incredible.

9
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.140
And gets up and wins the rest of the round.
That's what's really incredible.

10
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.980
It's amazing.
Amazing fight.
Yeah.
So you don't follow,

11
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.660
you don't follow any little tail.

12
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.520
<v 1>Um,
you know,
um,
that part of my life I'm on,</v>

13
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.520
I've got mixed feelings with that part of my life.
Right.

14
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.560
And I stuff up.
I don't like about myself and stuff.
That is right.

15
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.610
I tried to forget that stuff cause I'm going to hold different,
um,
if I hadn't.

16
00:00:54.611 --> 00:00:55.444
Yeah.

17
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.870
<v 0>So even watching other people bar,</v>

18
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.620
<v 1>it's only worth nothing.
I tried to stay away much as possible.</v>

19
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.430
<v 0>So watching other people box makes you think about yourself when you were</v>

20
00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:07.260
fighting reminds you of it kind of,
yeah.
Yeah.

21
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.680
He's got some ways Nathan and I would,
you know what I mean?
I'd be the cool guy.

22
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.460
Yeah.
Right.
Like who?
Who else?
Yeah.

23
00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:20.950
There's no one out there today that's got that mean vicious persona and nice
guy.

24
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.621
Yeah.

25
00:01:21.621 --> 00:01:25.380
You when you were in the ring doing a post fight interview saying you want to

26
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.810
eat your children,
you want to eat someone's children.
I remember saying it.

27
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.340
This is the craziest fucking post fight interview.
It was.

28
00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:34.220
It was about Lennox Lewis,
right?
Yeah.
If I'm mad,
one of the great,

29
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.730
what's wrong with me?
I'm just a madman.
It was amazing.

30
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.660
It was amazing for the,
for the story for the time.
I mean,

31
00:01:41.661 --> 00:01:45.950
look what it was was when we saw rocky three right,

32
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.890
and Mr t was,
it was challenging,
you know,

33
00:01:48.891 --> 00:01:51.950
a rocky and he would say all that crazy shit about what he was going to do.

34
00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:54.350
My prediction pain.
Beautiful.

35
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.180
What you did is you took that and just cranked it up to 11 and threw gasoline on

36
00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:02.920
it and lit it on fire.
You just took that kind of ferocious shit.

37
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.250
<v 1>Yeah.
I look at some of those press conferences in a long time when my,</v>

38
00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:08.500
what I'm faintly talk to anybody like that.

39
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.510
<v 0>Definitely world now my world would feel different now.</v>

40
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.520
Do you feel when you watch that stuff that you feel almost like trapped by that

41
00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:20.210
past like that you have to acknowledge it.
You don't even acknowledge it anymore.

42
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.200
<v 1>Yeah.
I'm almost a little bit like,
I don't want to be involved.
We stayed.</v>

43
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.040
Never happened.
Yeah.
Yeah.

44
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.710
But kind of had to happen for you to be who you are and they'll know it's

45
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.760
because people,
this is the real reason why they chose people.

46
00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:35.110
Still people left that guy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then people will love that.

47
00:02:35.111 --> 00:02:36.740
I didn't like that guy that much.

48
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.470
So I have my own conflicting with people that liked that guy.

49
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.220
Me Living my life that I am living now.
Yeah.

50
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.340
<v 0>Well,
people love that guy because that guy gave them a drug and that drug was</v>

51
00:02:46.341 --> 00:02:51.020
excitement like you,
you turn on the TV like,
Oh shit,
here we go,
Michael Spanx,

52
00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:55.310
Mike Tyson,
here we go.
And boom.
Oh,
that's what people wanted.

53
00:02:55.311 --> 00:02:58.400
They wanted that excitement.
They knew some crazy shit was about to go down.

54
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.810
Unpredictable.
You can't,
you don't.
No one knows it's going to happen at a fight.

55
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:04.060
Is it going to be a right or a left?
Is he going to move right,

56
00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:05.830
is going to move left.
How's it going to work out?

57
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.380
You don't know how long could Spinks last.
You don't know.

58
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.070
And everybody was excited and that was,
that's what you brought people.

59
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.770
You brought people this,
this chaotic moment.

60
00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:16.150
You slapped down the money and the paper,

61
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.730
you got out your popcorn and you waited for the,
the rush,

62
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.150
the rush of excitement of the crazy days.
Crazy days.

63
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.740
Okay.
Then,
I mean,
I hate to keep bringing your head back to that,
but just for me,

64
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.300
uh,
as a kid growing up during that time,
it was a big part of my,
you know,

65
00:03:33.301 --> 00:03:36.900
my becoming an adult.
It was during your era,

66
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.400
your error of dominance.

67
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.510
<v 1>I always look at my kids and I think,
why did you guys pretty much</v>

68
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.113
<v 2>mmm.</v>

69
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.610
<v 1>Um,
middle class kid.</v>

70
00:03:46.611 --> 00:03:49.100
They live their life to do what they wanted to go to college and everything.

71
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.310
I W I w I would never want to put that pressure on my third that you have to be

72
00:03:52.311 --> 00:03:54.060
the total best.
You have to dominate everybody.

73
00:03:54.061 --> 00:03:55.550
You're going to be the best to ever live at this.

74
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.040
He's put that kind of pressure on him.
That's incredible.

75
00:03:58.041 --> 00:04:02.270
I would never do that to them.
Yeah.
It would never work.
Probably.
I mean,

76
00:04:02.271 --> 00:04:06.480
I don't think a kid that grows up in a loving household with supportive boxing

77
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.640
for when you have nothing,
he's barking when you,
it had nothing.

78
00:04:10.641 --> 00:04:14.540
Cause that's a lot of,
um,
as a lot of dedication.
It's a lot of pain.

79
00:04:14.541 --> 00:04:18.560
That's a lot of aggravation loud.
You know what I mean?
Really?
Yes.

80
00:04:18.561 --> 00:04:20.510
I'm discovering who you are.
