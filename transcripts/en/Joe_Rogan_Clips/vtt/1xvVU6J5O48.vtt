1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.860
And I think as I get a little bit older,

2
00:00:01.861 --> 00:00:04.320
then I start to get in touch with them more than I'm like,
Oh man,

3
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.790
I don't want to feelings.

4
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.870
How much of a big growth push was it for you to like get California being around

5
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.930
all those different kinds of people and be around the comedy store?

6
00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:18.670
And I think intimidating is the biggest thing for me.

7
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.660
I don't want to bother people.
Yeah.
Sometimes it still is.
Like I'll talk to,

8
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.230
you know,
guys that I admire or stuff or look up to as comedians.

9
00:00:26.231 --> 00:00:30.000
And sometimes I feel,
um,
I feel,

10
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.590
I don't know if I feel inferior,
but I just,

11
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.060
for some reason I always feel like,
you know,

12
00:00:37.061 --> 00:00:39.430
I don't want people to think that I'm trying to take anything from them.

13
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.100
I know what you mean.
And so it makes me feel like I feel like that too.
Yeah.

14
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.350
It's like I'm afraid to ask sometimes or to tall or even to engage because I

15
00:00:47.351 --> 00:00:52.090
just think that people are gonna think that I'm not trying to be genuine.

16
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.870
Yeah.

17
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.620
And so and if I don't know how I feel and how genuine I am sometimes or if I

18
00:00:56.621 --> 00:00:58.690
questioned that,
if I question myself all the time,

19
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.680
then that makes that even double scary to try and like create friendships and

20
00:01:02.681 --> 00:01:07.090
stuff.
I feel you,
I know exactly what you're saying but it's getting better.

21
00:01:07.091 --> 00:01:07.924
I think,
you know,

22
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.900
there's been a lot of support like you know guys like you getting a hang out

23
00:01:10.901 --> 00:01:14.890
with some of the other guys,
you know and just realize that we're all the same.

24
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.120
Yeah.
It just takes,
it takes a while to realize that.

25
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.770
I remember the same feeling I had,

26
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.220
especially in the 90s when my career could have gone any,

27
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.870
either way.
It could have crashed and burned.

28
00:01:26.871 --> 00:01:28.700
Just as easy as it could have survived.

29
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.480
It didn't necessarily have to keep going and it'll all those,

30
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.540
those days when I'd run into people that were successful at see them and I just

31
00:01:37.821 --> 00:01:41.570
feel weird.
Do you want to say hi to him?
Felt odd.
Yeah.

32
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.930
I met Dave Chappelle when he was like,

33
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.120
I think he was 18 and I was 21 or 22 or something like that.

34
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.990
How old's Dave now?

35
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.910
46 [inaudible] I think he's like four years younger than me.

36
00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.370
So whatever that was.
So maybe he was 18 I was 44 44 so older than that.

37
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.490
So he must've been 18 and I must have been 24 so when,

38
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.980
when I met him,
you know,
we were both just starting out.

39
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.070
We were both kids,
but he got way more famous than me quick.

40
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.340
And I was more famous for doing other shit.

41
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.850
Like I was famous for a fear factor and for being on a,

42
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.860
on a sitcom,
you know,

43
00:02:24.861 --> 00:02:28.610
it wasn't famous for being myself and so I'd be like weird around him too.

44
00:02:28.611 --> 00:02:30.740
But he was always friendly.
They'll be like,
okay,
I guess.

45
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.920
I guess he actually likes me.
Yeah,
but this is that weird thing.
We,

46
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.100
it takes a while to be comfortable enough in your own skin,

47
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.070
where now I see people like whoever it is,

48
00:02:40.071 --> 00:02:43.280
like I ranted a Patton Oswald last night,
gave him a big hug,
like,
what's up?

49
00:02:43.281 --> 00:02:45.550
What are you doing?
I don't feel weird around him at all.
Right.

50
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.290
I don't feel reared around other famous comedians anymore.
Right.

51
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.960
I certainly did you,

52
00:02:50.961 --> 00:02:55.961
but you always question your legitimacy question whether or not you should be

53
00:02:56.211 --> 00:02:58.370
there,
you know,
questioned whether you're,

54
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.110
you're enough or whether they like you or maybe they don't like your kind of

55
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:07.100
comedy,
or maybe they don't like what you're doing or,
yeah.
Yeah.
There's a,

56
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.870
yeah.
There's so many questions.
There's so much in,
for me anyway.
Yeah.

57
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:15.280
There was some of,
there's just been so much in,
you know,
a feeling of,
you know,

58
00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:19.030
just growing up,
feelings of self worth issues and then it,
man,

59
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:22.580
all that kind of stuff.
But I think it does get better.
Yeah.
