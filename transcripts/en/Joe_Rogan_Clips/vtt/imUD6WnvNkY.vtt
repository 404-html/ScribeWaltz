00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.450
Last question because I guess no discussion of presidential policy and the,

2
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.830
the possibility of someone like you running this countries.

3
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.940
How do you feel about international relations and the obvious issues of dealing

4
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:20.430
with other countries and what's going on with China and Russia and the

5
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:24.930
interference of our democracy and all the different various issues that we've

6
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.400
experienced over the last,

7
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.830
particularly over the last couple of years with Russia.

8
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.671
<v 1>Yeah,
sure.</v>

9
00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:32.550
So about Russia and you and I were talking about this before we went on air.

10
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.130
When I'm president I will say,
look Russia,
I get it.

11
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.970
We have tampered with other people's elections for years and decades.
We America,

12
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.890
I've done that.
You've done it to us for the last number of years.

13
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.990
It is going to stop right now.

14
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.580
And if we have any credible evidence that you are tampering with our information

15
00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:54.331
and our democracy,

16
00:00:54.331 --> 00:00:58.560
we will take that as an act of hostility and aggression and we will retaliate in

17
00:00:58.561 --> 00:00:59.820
some way that will make your life very,

18
00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:03.180
very painful and inconvenient and the unit and the people of United States will

19
00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:08.010
support me on this.
And so here is your drop dead date.
Like turn off the bots.

20
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.490
And if we find that your bots are still going after this date,

21
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.060
I will just bring the evidence of the American people and then we will act and

22
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:18.710
you will not like it one bit.
Now if,
if I,
I'm,

23
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.960
I'm thinking 80 90% of Americans would get behind that and it'd be like,

24
00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:24.660
how are we just like looking at it being like,
what are we going to do?

25
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.640
What are we going to do?
And in this one,

26
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:30.330
I actually feel a little bit for the tech companies because it's very difficult

27
00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:33.180
for the tech companies to,
uh,
to prevent

28
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.010
<v 0>this almost impossible,
almost impossible.
It's impossible to identify.</v>

29
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.610
And if you go back to Sam Harris's podcasts,
who we were discussing,

30
00:01:40.611 --> 00:01:42.410
which is called the war of information,

31
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.440
that I think that's what's called information war or war of information for a

32
00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:47.860
recent podcast when the last couple of weeks.
Um,

33
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.020
they detail how there's essentially just giant groups of people that work for

34
00:01:53.751 --> 00:01:58.670
the Russian government that pretend to be people that are involved in black

35
00:01:58.671 --> 00:02:02.390
lives matter or pretend to be people that are involved in Texas culture,

36
00:02:02.391 --> 00:02:03.380
southern culture.

37
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.590
And they're just sowing seeds of argument and descent and they are laughing

38
00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:12.050
their asses off and making funny memes.

39
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.420
Like some of their memes are really hilarious.

40
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.810
But to them this is the greatest Roi they've ever seen.

41
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.890
They didn't even like return on investment.
Okay.

42
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.800
You such an entrepreneur,
youtube,
right.
Man,

43
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.290
I don't have a man hangar.
I haven't normal freaking house.
So

44
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.370
<v 1>uh,
like they invested not even that much money like,</v>

45
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.250
but they've found like this underbelly like can just speaking slice into and so

46
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.200
they've spent best estimates,

47
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.250
like low tens of millions of dollars and it's caused us how much damage,

48
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.200
how much harm a real impact in town.
Like you know,

49
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.750
I mean you couldn't even put a dollar figure on it.
So you have to just say like,

50
00:02:52.751 --> 00:02:53.050
look,

51
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.020
I get the tech companies are going to try but they're not going to be able to

52
00:02:56.021 --> 00:02:56.471
pull it off.

53
00:02:56.471 --> 00:03:00.460
So just like go on and to stay to like the world and hey this is to Russia.

54
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:04.390
But anyone else,
same thing.
Like if you tamper with our democracy,

55
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:07.750
we are going to come down on you like a ton of bricks and if we're not quite

56
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:10.450
sure,
we're still going to come down on you like a ton of bricks.

57
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.900
Like I don't need like 100% certainty on this.
I need like,
you know,

58
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:17.510
like a legal standard.
I need like 80,
85%.
Um,

59
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.950
and the American people would be like about time because you know the,

60
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:24.460
if we can't trust ourselves or each other or what we're seeing,

61
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.100
and this is before deep fakes and the rest of it starts hitting.

62
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.310
Like if you're actually going to believe in democracy,

63
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.000
then you have to start protecting our information as fast as possible.

64
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.630
And you also in mind,
mind have to start,
and this is a local issue,

65
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:40.060
but I'm in New Hampshire and Iowa talking about this stuff,

66
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.950
their local newspapers are all dying.

67
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.970
It's like thousands of local papers is winking out of existence because they

68
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:48.780
used to rely on classified ads.
There are no classified ads anymore.

69
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.170
It's all craigslist and so they all die.
And if you believe in democracy,

70
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:56.470
how the heck can anyone vote on anything if they have no idea what's going on?

71
00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.430
So,
so there are a lot of interrelated issues and one thing I'm saying is like,

72
00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:00.970
look,

73
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.050
we had a happy time where local newspapers were supported by classified ads.

74
00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:07.480
It's over now,
but we're still a democracy.

75
00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:09.250
You still need some information to vote.

76
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.900
So we need to try and find new ways for you to get quality information like
that.

77
00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:16.210
Those thrown our hands up and being,
I guess the Russians are going to,

78
00:04:16.211 --> 00:04:20.320
you know like just misinform us with bots and I guess all the local newspapers

79
00:04:20.321 --> 00:04:21.760
are going to die.
Like you said,

80
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:25.060
like these are problems and we have to start solving them.

81
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.590
If you still believe that democracy is the best form of government,

82
00:04:29.591 --> 00:04:30.750
and that's what we're going to carry forward with,

83
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.870
which you obviously have to believe,
like you have to go with that as your model.

84
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.010
And so it's all interrelated,
but we have to start thinking much,

85
00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:41.890
much bigger about what we can get done because things are slipping away.

86
00:04:41.891 --> 00:04:45.610
Things are trending in a terrible,
terrible direction.
Well,
Andrew,

87
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.050
good luck to you.
You're a good man.
I wish you well.
Thank you for being here.

88
00:04:50.051 --> 00:04:53.410
I think your message is excellent and,
uh,
I hope you really make an impact.
