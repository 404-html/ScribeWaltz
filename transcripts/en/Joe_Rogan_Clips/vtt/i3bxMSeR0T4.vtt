Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.210
You know the other question is how much of a vitamin do you need?

3
00:00:06.211 --> 00:00:08.330
And I think that people uh,
you know,

4
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.800
buy vitamins indiscriminately cause we really don't.

5
00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:13.860
I like the average person doesn't need to take a multivitamin in the day if

6
00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:15.330
they're eating a,
you know,

7
00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:19.230
a healthy diet cause you get pretty much what you need on a daily basis if

8
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:22.730
you're not somebody with an absorption issue.
If you're not somebody with a,

9
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.450
any like any dietary issues,

10
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.420
you're generally getting what you need out of your diet.
I think people do it.

11
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.520
If your diet is really healthy,
it's,

12
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.060
most people do not have a really healthy diet.

13
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.300
Most people are getting about what they need out of their diet.

14
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.780
Like seriously it's,
I mean if we have the,

15
00:00:39.781 --> 00:00:43.440
some of the poorest darts or people are just eating process bullshit.

16
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.430
Well no it's even if you go to the doctor and get average person,

17
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.240
I'm guessing you eat fairly healthy.

18
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.540
It's what the average person that they go to the doctor to see if they're

19
00:00:51.541 --> 00:00:54.930
deficient on everything,
on anything they're not going to be deficient on.

20
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.810
I've gone and gotten my blood work done.
Several deficiencies,
Niacin,

21
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.750
vitamin D now I've been before.

22
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:07.660
But that was right when I was diagnosed with CELIAC disease.
So I was,
I,

23
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.710
I was deficient on a few things.
But you know,

24
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.340
that's an issue with we have an issue absorbing food.
Yeah.
So I mean,
now,

25
00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:16.590
well now that I've been,
it was,

26
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.830
I was at the skinniest point in my life and then I stopped eating wheat and I

27
00:01:19.831 --> 00:01:24.330
gained weight.
So because suddenly you're your bill.
I kind of,
you know,
they,

28
00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:27.710
they heal and you're her able to absorb calories.
Again,

29
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.960
have a friend who's got a son who they was trying to figure out why he was so

30
00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:34.850
small,
he couldn't eat and he was never hungry and eat,

31
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.650
everything is miserable and he's got a wheat allergy.

32
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.410
He's got a corn allergy.
Jesus,
everything was just making him miserable.

33
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.740
I mean,
I got quote unquote lucky.
I only got symptoms when I was in adults.
Uh,

34
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.610
and it was,
you know,
all throughout your childhood years.
No problem,
no problem.

35
00:01:53.611 --> 00:01:57.990
And I mean,
I was even overweight,
uh,
as,
as a kid.
So then when I was an adult,

36
00:01:57.991 --> 00:02:01.770
suddenly horrible symptoms showed up.
I wasn't at work.

37
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.460
Do they have an idea of Celiac?
A Celia can show up,

38
00:02:05.461 --> 00:02:06.500
are the symptoms of it can shoot.

39
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.590
Like you always have the underlying physiology or um,

40
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.730
and just all of a sudden symptoms can just show up out of the blue and then all

41
00:02:14.731 --> 00:02:16.400
of a sudden it becomes,
I mean I kind of,

42
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.300
I had a bunch of health decisions cause to kind of show up in my twenties and I

43
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.230
mean I started,
I'm like,
all right,
I got to start taking care of myself,

44
00:02:22.231 --> 00:02:26.290
started going to the gym,
run a few marathons,
lost a lot of weight.
And like,

45
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.050
even when I was suddenly at a healthy weight,

46
00:02:28.051 --> 00:02:33.030
it was like I couldn't stop losing weight because my,
uh,
my intestines just worn,

47
00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:34.980
absorbing anything.
And that's not a,

48
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.410
that's not a thing you see coming or like I'm at a healthy,

49
00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:41.190
why isn't this stopping?
And it was not good.
But you know,

50
00:02:41.191 --> 00:02:45.120
eventually it was funny because the gluten trend or the anti gluten trend had

51
00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:47.130
already showed up.
And a doctor suggested to me,
well,

52
00:02:47.131 --> 00:02:51.090
have you tried going gluten free?
And I'm like,
oh,
that's a silly fad.

53
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.240
Three months later,
Tyco,
celiac disease.
I'm like,

54
00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:57.970
if I hadn't been so skeptical of everything,
gluten free is a fad.

55
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.220
I don't think gluten is the best thing for your body.

56
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.290
<v 1>I think that it's okay every now and then,</v>

57
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.010
but I think that essentially what you're getting when you're eating processed

58
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:09.430
grains is you're getting something.
Your body is key.
It's kind of alien.

59
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.990
The Bondi doesn't exactly know what to do with it.

60
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.780
<v 0>Well,
there doesn't seem,
here's things.
Tests keeps showing.</v>

61
00:03:13.781 --> 00:03:15.910
There doesn't seem to be a problem with gluten.

62
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:18.250
If you don't have celiac disease and it's,

63
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.730
<v 1>what does that mean by a problem?
Is it like for optimizing your health?</v>

64
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.730
Is it something that you should have in your diet all the time?

65
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:28.560
Or is it something that mean it really does convert to sugar?
It's right.

66
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.930
<v 0>Everything converts to sugar.
Your body converts everything in some way,</v>

67
00:03:32.931 --> 00:03:36.500
shape or form into usable fuel.
And the usable fuel is,
you know,

68
00:03:36.501 --> 00:03:38.810
eventually glucose or nad ph or,
um,

69
00:03:38.811 --> 00:03:43.120
there's everything in your body gets converted to sugar when you use feel,

70
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.610
<v 1>but if you eat a piece of salmon or if he had a bowl of pasta is a very</v>

71
00:03:46.611 --> 00:03:49.070
different reaction.
How your body absorbs these two things.

72
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.100
<v 0>It's a,
yes,
this is,
this is true because all calories aren't,
aren't the same,</v>

73
00:03:53.101 --> 00:03:54.960
right?
They don't both get absorbed to sugar,

74
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.370
but avoiding gluten and switching over to say,
uh,
you know,

75
00:03:59.371 --> 00:04:04.170
all rice,
uh,
isn't,
you know,
that's not going to change,
uh,
far the,

76
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.040
all that much in your body in terms of what's in terms of the biochemical

77
00:04:08.041 --> 00:04:12.180
mischief.
Unless you have a gluten allergy,
like that's,

78
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.810
or not a good analogy.
Yeah.

79
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.290
<v 1>Seeing the sensitivity's but there's,
there's also level,
so that too,
right?</v>

80
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:19.160
Like there's some people where it's like mildly,

81
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.630
minorly irritating and there's some people that have extreme issues with it.

82
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.430
<v 0>Well,
here's at this point,</v>

83
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.890
and this is why I always say at this point in our scientific knowledge,

84
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.190
scientific knowledge can evolve and we can learn new things.
Uh,
you know,

85
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:34.090
at one point,
the thing that started off the whole gluten trend,
uh,
was uh,

86
00:04:34.091 --> 00:04:38.410
kind of poorly a poorly designed study where they had a small sample size of

87
00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:42.580
people and they designed it just to test,
you know,
gluten versus a non,

88
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.870
a diet without gluten.

89
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.100
And they came to the conclusion that about 20% of people just based on this very

90
00:04:48.101 --> 00:04:52.520
small study had a bad reaction to gluten now pretty well.

91
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.500
And these people had came in saying they had stomach problems.

92
00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.950
Now these people,
it turned out,
they looked at it and said,
there's no,

93
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.290
there's no afterwards assigned to Saul sat back and said,

94
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.220
why we're only about 1% of people having celiac disease.

95
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.610
And then all of a sudden 20% of people are running around like glutens making

96
00:05:09.611 --> 00:05:12.670
their Dick flies off a fly off.
This is,
there's something up here.

97
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.780
So they made a better design study and they took out common core.
They did,

98
00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:17.100
you know,

99
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.470
kind of double blind did a a a better design study to say we're going to take

100
00:05:20.471 --> 00:05:24.580
out all these other causes of gastrointestinal distress and we're going to try

101
00:05:24.581 --> 00:05:27.820
and make this double blind.
And they figured out it was the fodmaps it was,

102
00:05:27.821 --> 00:05:31.660
there were these short chain illegal saccharide second pull water into the gut

103
00:05:31.661 --> 00:05:33.550
and cause some gastrointestinal distress.

104
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.050
And it was really closer to between like one at about 5% of people that were

105
00:05:38.051 --> 00:05:40.150
having any issues with gluten.

106
00:05:40.151 --> 00:05:43.310
Now the problem is that what was causing that though the,

107
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.190
the gastrointestinal distress in the smell and the one to 5% so 1% is celiac

108
00:05:48.191 --> 00:05:52.540
disease for sure.
1% his across the board with people.

109
00:05:52.541 --> 00:05:55.180
1% is silly.
That is fairly high.

110
00:05:55.181 --> 00:05:59.210
Now here's the thing that that higher of people that two to five,

111
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.171
here's the question,

112
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:03.500
now they're still trying to figure out why some people seem to have an issue

113
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:06.830
with gluten.
Now I could be wrong on,
this is just off the top of my head,

114
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.350
what I remember from the study,
but I've had decided a few times.

115
00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:13.520
So I think my knowledge is accurate.
Uh,
feel free to fact check me out at home.

116
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.970
Um,
but the,
um,
the thing with those extra percent,

117
00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:20.960
they're trying to figure out why they might have an issue with gluten because

118
00:06:20.961 --> 00:06:24.410
they,
you know,
like wheat is,
you know,
you think of it as a carb heavy thing,

119
00:06:24.411 --> 00:06:29.360
right?
And gluten is a protein a,
so that other few percentage of people,

120
00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:32.390
they're trying to figure out why the gluten does it cause gluten is in a few

121
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:35.810
other things.
It's in barley,
raw and rye.
Uh,

122
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.700
so what they figured out is that,
or this is the going theory right now,
uh,

123
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.510
gluten can cause a small,
uh,
uh,

124
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.810
reaction in the stomach where you produce this protein called Zonulin that can

125
00:06:47.811 --> 00:06:51.230
cause an increase in inflammation.
This seems to be,
and this is what I,

126
00:06:51.231 --> 00:06:55.070
this has only been one study that I've read on it.
It seems to be relatively new.

127
00:06:55.071 --> 00:06:56.120
They're still looking into it.

128
00:06:56.121 --> 00:07:00.050
So there's a chance that people might be in the two to 5% that can handle it.

129
00:07:00.051 --> 00:07:04.520
Because if that,
um,
it could be another component of the wheat,
barley,

130
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.350
rye that's causing it,
but gluten in and of itself,
it's not,
you know,
it's,

131
00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.970
unless you are one of those people that has an actual reaction to it,

132
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.200
perfectly fine.
Go on to have,
you know,
go have a sandwich.
So,
but you know,

133
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.093
if you want one

134
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:27.010
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
