WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
You go down to San Diego and what,

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.600
what are they doing for you that gets you off of the antidepressants and gets

3
00:00:06.601 --> 00:00:11.470
you feeling better?
So,
uh,
it's again,
like you get in there and I mean it's,

4
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.200
it's scary to go.
Again,
like I said,
there's,

5
00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:17.000
there's all these different people in there.
I'm the man found the,

6
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.310
the research on it by treating his own autistic kid and you can see the before

7
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:26.240
and after videos of this kid and it's like,
damn.
Okay.
And then,
um,

8
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.020
I brought my son into,
cause he has ADHD and he's off his medication now as well.

9
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.480
So I'm going in there.
Uh,

10
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.430
they do an EEG first and then they can tell which parts of your brain are firing

11
00:00:38.431 --> 00:00:40.770
it,
what hurts in seeing,
um,

12
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.680
the congruencies in like how all of that is happening or not happening.
And um,

13
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.440
then they kind of prescribed these,
these different,

14
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.950
these machines like on your,
on your brain that make,
uh,

15
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.470
these like electric impulses,
but they're magnetic to,
um,

16
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.940
kind of speed up or slow down the different parts of your brain.

17
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.880
So if the front of your brain is moving slower than the back of your brain are

18
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:07.410
those or,
or whatever.
So,
um,
they're noticing obviously,

19
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.160
uh,
patterns with fighters,
hockey players,
football players,
like,

20
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.690
like people that are leading with their heads.
Basically.
I'm having like,

21
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.860
uh,
and then with the veterans are like emotional things to where I mean ever.

22
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.900
And Yeah.
And then like,
I mean,
having to compartmentalize as well,

23
00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:29.430
like some of the shit they see should be upsetting,
you know,
and,
and you know,

24
00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:31.920
but there's,
there's different ways that we can train our brain to,

25
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.600
to drop things like that.

26
00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:38.310
And then PTSD is when it's an involuntary and it all comes in and,
and that,

27
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:42.960
so,
you know,
I,
I've been diagnosed with PTSD.

28
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.730
I had walked in there with medication because of being depressed,
uh,

29
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.780
and the anxiety and all of that.
Like my symptoms were terrible.

30
00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:55.380
And I know there are a combination of things,
but even like my startle reflex,

31
00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:58.920
like,
you know,
I could hear someone come walking around the corner like,
clap,

32
00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:01.830
clap,
clap here,
their shoes.
But the second I'd see them,
it would,

33
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.240
it would stop my heart for a second.
And that's like shit on your adrenal glands,

34
00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:08.280
you know,
and,
and,
um,

35
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.300
all this stuff was anxiety that,
um,

36
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.590
I don't know.
It was,
it was hard to fall asleep at night.
Uh,
you know,

37
00:02:16.591 --> 00:02:19.530
my memory was crap and this is all,
you know,

38
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.100
different stuff happening in all these other fighters that I know as well.

39
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.360
But I mean,
like I said,
I've been trying things so much,

40
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.740
so much over the past few years that I get excited about and either it works or

41
00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:36.340
it doesn't.
And,
um,
the,
the point is,
is,

42
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.870
is now I found this and I feel better from this,
but I,

43
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.850
I was so excited about all these other things.

44
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.240
Like I can't just start telling everybody of the new thing that I found because

45
00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:48.900
I've said that and been excited about like everything else with this one,

46
00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:53.760
this one,
like the equal scope,
it's like,
uh,
it's,
uh,

47
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.950
um,
same thing.
It's kind of like a tens machine or stem machine,
but like a super,

48
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.820
super low frequency.
And that's bad ass too.
I get it.
It helped on injuries,

49
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:06.250
like if I rolled my ankle or hurt my toe,

50
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:11.140
like you could bring the swelling down from this to to normal essentially in

51
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:14.890
like an hour and a half just working on with this like tens unit on it.
And,

52
00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:19.740
and I mean they originally used it for race horses and for you know,

53
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.320
super expensive million dollar horses.
Like the equipment they brought over,

54
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:25.870
it was like 90 grand and like,

55
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.150
like these really specific like special metals that were put into these plates

56
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:34.360
and you know,
they do stuff like that,
but that wasn't working on my head.

57
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:37.150
It was working on injuries and it was working on,
um,

58
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.800
I want to say it helped with like my like digestive system maybe or my,

59
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.740
uh,
I don't remember some,
some other things it was helping with too,

60
00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:50.980
but what,
you know,
I,
I I started doing that,
um,

61
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.820
or I was doing that when I walked into mindset and started doing that treatment.

62
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.470
So you sit in a chair,
you know,

63
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.470
and they ha they put this prescription in this machine and the machine is kinda

64
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.313
got like a,

65
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.310
like a arm that goes on in a specific part of your brain and you,
you know,

66
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.300
you close your eyes and it sends these,
these magnetic pulses into your head.

67
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.310
And I mean,
you don't feel anything.

68
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:19.030
It's almost like you can hear what it feels like,

69
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.880
but I don't know how to describe it.
It's,
it's a sense it's,
there's,

70
00:04:22.881 --> 00:04:26.830
it's central but it's not,
it's not exactly hearing and it's not exactly feeling,

71
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.680
um,
yeah.
And I mean you,

72
00:04:30.681 --> 00:04:34.660
you leave the place after your treatment.
Like I go,
I would go twice a day.

73
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:37.540
It's 45 minutes away both ways.

74
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.730
So I am driving a lot everyday to go to do this cause I want to give it a fair

75
00:04:42.731 --> 00:04:45.730
shot,
do it every day.
I do everyday,

76
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.330
I haven't gone these past couple of weeks cause uh,
stuff with my kids.
Uh,

77
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.980
scheduled school's almost out and then wanting to try out different things with

78
00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:57.010
different coaches as far as these new disciplines go.

79
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.070
So I haven't been there as much.
But um,
yeah,

80
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.100
for the last August I believe is is when I was like really,

81
00:05:06.371 --> 00:05:09.250
really getting into it and go on twice a day and 45 minutes each way.

82
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.230
Twice a day.
Twice a day.
Yeah.

83
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.110
You would spend 45 minutes one way,
go back,

84
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.360
go back again.
Just fucking move closer to where the places,

85
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.070
because the alliance was down there and so I would,

86
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.550
I would drop my kid off at school.
I would run,

87
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.250
and then I would go there.
I would do my treatment,

88
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.780
I'd go back to practice down in southern San Diego,
then I'd get my son,

89
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.040
and then we'd go up there for the afternoon session and then I'd come back down

90
00:05:39.041 --> 00:05:41.700
and,
and we'd go to his sports and then I'd have my second two a day.

91
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.310
That does not leave a lot of free time for cats and Ghana.
Oh Hell No.
Oh Hell No.

92
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.630
Just that alone can be stressful.
But I was seeing the results.

93
00:05:52.631 --> 00:05:55.420
That was the crazy thing is I was feeling better.
Well,

94
00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.810
the results when I just walked
in,
like,
like God,

95
00:06:00.811 --> 00:06:05.680
like I couldn't sleep,
I had just,
uh,
anxiety,
like I had that,
that um,

96
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.460
startle effect going,
like the,
um,

97
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.110
my memory was shit and these were all things that I went to the UFC pie to talk

98
00:06:13.111 --> 00:06:17.430
to them about some like,
I don't know what to do.
Like I,
I want to fight.

99
00:06:17.431 --> 00:06:22.431
They offered me to fight Chris Cyborg at one 45 and I was like more of the same.

100
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.730
Yeah.
And I was like,
well,
like hell yeah,
let's take that,
but like,

101
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.620
can you guys at least help me get this shit figured out first,
please.
You know?

102
00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:32.430
And they're like,
sure.
Um,
so Dunkin French,
he's at the,

103
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.920
the,
he's,
he's,
he's,
so he went to college and,
and was that an oh no,

104
00:06:37.921 --> 00:06:42.060
he was at Notre Dame using this treatment with the doctor.
Um,

105
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.160
Kevin Murphy that runs the mindset.
So,
uh,
he was like,

106
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.730
this guy is doing a lot of things with people as far as brain health.
He's like,

107
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.940
go see them when you get back to San Diego,
it's kind of far from you.

108
00:06:53.941 --> 00:06:57.630
But like give it a shot Kat.
And I called the guy,
I'm on the phone,

109
00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.850
super frustrated,
like super like emotional.
I'm like,
I'm,

110
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.790
I'm at my wit's end.

111
00:07:02.791 --> 00:07:05.970
Like I've tried everything I can think of like holistic views,

112
00:07:05.971 --> 00:07:09.090
like chemical views,
this like everything.
I mean,

113
00:07:09.091 --> 00:07:12.240
spending money out of my pocket trying to figure this out cause none of this is

114
00:07:12.241 --> 00:07:14.700
covered by the UFC especially because,
you know,

115
00:07:14.701 --> 00:07:16.080
not something I claimed in a fight.

116
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.740
I mean I fought Amanda and if you don't claim that stuff within the 30 days,

117
00:07:19.741 --> 00:07:22.920
like you're on your own.
And of course my head hurt.
Of course I'm dizzy.

118
00:07:22.921 --> 00:07:26.490
Of course lights are bright,
of course.
I can't think.
Right.
I got in a fist fight,

119
00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:31.290
you know,
and I,
I wasn't doing good in it for awhile,
so I,
I figured,
you know,

120
00:07:31.291 --> 00:07:35.400
but then a month and a half,
two months out when I wasn't better.
It's like,

121
00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.510
<v 1>so even though it clearly came from that fight,
you still don't get covered.</v>

122
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:45.490
<v 0>[inaudible] what not one.
It's endocrine stuff too,
you know,
and it's like,</v>

123
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.840
there's very,
there's like

124
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:51.470
<v 1>how could they dispute that?
That's where it came from.
Now you go,
hey,
sit down.</v>

125
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.070
I want you to watch something and just play that first round.
Go,

126
00:07:55.071 --> 00:07:57.620
what the fuck do you think happened?
Yeah,
I don't know,

127
00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.570
but I mean if you play that video for them,

128
00:07:59.571 --> 00:08:04.250
if any buddy in the insurance business was denying you coverage saying that

129
00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:08.030
didn't happen while you were under the banner of the UFC,

130
00:08:08.031 --> 00:08:10.430
like you're out of your fucking mind.
Watch that video.

131
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:15.080
What do you think is happening while this fucking assassin is throwing bombs at

132
00:08:15.081 --> 00:08:19.790
your face?
I mean that's it.
That is crazy that that's not covered.

133
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.770
Yeah,
that makes me sick.

134
00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.000
<v 0>Oh,
it's frustrating cause bye bye.</v>

135
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:28.970
Like literally you look at the papers like it costs me more to fight then.

136
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.370
Then it,
then I made,

137
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:31.111
<v 1>let's see,</v>

138
00:08:31.111 --> 00:08:35.000
now it might make sense if it was dealing with a broken hand or a torn ligament

139
00:08:35.001 --> 00:08:37.160
or something like that.
It might make sense in mine,

140
00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.740
it does not make any fucking sense.

141
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:43.370
If you're talking about brain injuries cause anybody who understands how brain

142
00:08:43.371 --> 00:08:45.240
injuries work know that there's,

143
00:08:45.241 --> 00:08:48.920
there's a considerable amount of time after a fight where you still are

144
00:08:48.921 --> 00:08:53.240
suffering from symptoms and you might decide 30 days later,
60 days later,

145
00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:54.950
90 days later you've got to do something about it.

146
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:56.070
<v 0>Right.
Well,
I mean now</v>

147
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.180
<v 1>I know.
Yeah,
no,
I come out of a fight and I'm like,
my pinky hurts,
my elbow hurts,</v>

148
00:09:00.181 --> 00:09:04.860
my hair hurts,
my eyebrow hurts,
like claim all of this,
you know,

149
00:09:04.861 --> 00:09:09.130
because before I was just being tough,
you know,
I'm fine.
This is more,

150
00:09:09.131 --> 00:09:13.800
it's so crazy and I didn't like I didn't get it and I didn't know.
And then no,

151
00:09:13.801 --> 00:09:16.560
if they're in the,
if they're in the business of insuring fighters,

152
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:21.160
they should have a larger window where people can claim head injuries.
Right.

153
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:26.010
<v 0>But that's,
I mean that,
that it kind of goes together with like any kind of,</v>

154
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.420
any kind of mental,
anything.
Like any,
you talk about mental illness,

155
00:09:30.421 --> 00:09:32.600
you talk about head injuries,
you talk about Tbi.

156
00:09:32.601 --> 00:09:36.120
It all goes into that stigma of like you can't see it.
So it must not be real,

157
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.400
you know what I mean?
Or,
or whatever.

158
00:09:38.401 --> 00:09:42.720
So it's like that's the head injury business.
I mean basically,
yeah.

159
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.870
The point is to make them drop and be done.

160
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.780
<v 1>That's what everybody,
I mean it's not,
it's not the worst thing in the world.</v>

161
00:09:48.781 --> 00:09:50.340
The wind with a body kick or an arm bar.

162
00:09:50.341 --> 00:09:53.880
But the reality is what people like is to see head injuries were in the head

163
00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:57.170
injury business.
Right.
You know?
Yeah.
Yeah.

164
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:02.630
So how long after you starting with this treatment do you start to see results?

165
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:05.820
<v 0>So the first,</v>

166
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.780
I would say the first thing I noticed was my motor skills in practice.

167
00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:15.460
So,
you know,
I would go,
do you think your motor skills were impaired?
No,
I,

168
00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.240
well I just feel like I had a block.
Like I said,
like it's,

169
00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:22.990
it was comical and I mean,
you can even ask them at alliance and it was funny.

170
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:28.450
It was funny,
but not to have like,
we're in class,
you know,

171
00:10:28.451 --> 00:10:30.160
we're learning,
I'm watching the coaches,

172
00:10:30.161 --> 00:10:34.690
like they do a drill and they explain it and they look up.
All right,

173
00:10:34.691 --> 00:10:36.970
everybody ready?
Ready,
one,
two,
three go.

174
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.450
And we clap and I have no fucking idea what we're doing.
You know,

175
00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:42.790
like we walk off and I'm like,

176
00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.330
like there was even a couple of times where like they clap and there like,
Kat,

177
00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.750
what are we doing?
And I'm like,
uh,

178
00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:55.060
three cake.
And they're like,
no,
20 pushups.
And I'm like,
man,
I'm not even like,

179
00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:57.430
I'm not just a bad kid like talking and like,
no,

180
00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:01.420
let's say like I'm in trouble because I don't hear you.
Like I don't,

181
00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.480
I can like not lose eye contact the whole time,

182
00:11:04.481 --> 00:11:07.840
like sit here and I'm like focused,
but no,

183
00:11:07.841 --> 00:11:11.470
I'm not retaining it unless though like if it has to be the last thing that they

184
00:11:11.471 --> 00:11:13.990
do,
like we can't talk about shit.

185
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.730
If it's the last thing I see,
I can go do it,
I could go do it.

186
00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.380
But if they're like,
all right,

187
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:24.850
and then they explained some philosophy about it or do some movement or
whatever,

188
00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:26.500
like then I lose what we're doing.

189
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:28.780
Like my mind would just go right to something else.

190
00:11:28.781 --> 00:11:33.430
Like I had a very hard time concentrating and you know,
it's,

191
00:11:33.431 --> 00:11:36.790
it's crazy because when I got to this facility,
you know,
I didn't know,

192
00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.070
I didn't necessarily know what I was walking into,

193
00:11:39.071 --> 00:11:42.850
but they have you do this questionnaire and like on this questionnaire is like

194
00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.140
all of these things.
I'm like,

195
00:11:44.141 --> 00:11:47.140
that's part of something like me not being able to focus as part of something my

196
00:11:47.141 --> 00:11:48.070
sleep,
that's part of something,

197
00:11:48.071 --> 00:11:52.120
this startle effect is part of something like me having these like completely

198
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:56.410
like specific things that are all on this was like damn okay.

199
00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:00.280
Like I didn't even want to see the EEG because I was,
I was scared,
you know,

200
00:12:00.281 --> 00:12:02.050
I was like,
what if you can't fix me?

201
00:12:02.051 --> 00:12:05.950
And now I know all the shit that's wrong with me.
Like that sucks.
But then,

202
00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.770
you know,
they show you different egs and they show you the,

203
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.760
they take it every single week and so you actually get to see it and you get to

204
00:12:12.761 --> 00:12:14.920
see the level that you were functioning at,

205
00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:16.990
especially the different parts of your brain.
But then,

206
00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
and the thing is that's awesome about this is you get to keep the results.

207
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.700
Like unless you go do exactly what you did and go fuck it up again,

208
00:12:24.701 --> 00:12:28.660
like you get to keep it,
it's not like this maintenance package,
which is,

209
00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:32.260
you know,
a problem for these pharmaceutical companies.
There's,
there's,

210
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.820
there's not a whole lot of retention on it because once people get their brains

211
00:12:36.821 --> 00:12:37.241
functioning,

212
00:12:37.241 --> 00:12:39.610
as long as you're not sitting there hitting your head against a wall,

213
00:12:39.611 --> 00:12:44.110
like you get to keep feeling better.
Like these,
these veterans get to go back to,

214
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:49.150
to combat or whatever it is,
their job is like we fighters get to go back,

215
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.590
football players get to go back.

216
00:12:50.591 --> 00:12:55.570
Like I sat in with the chargers medical staff and talked about our stuff there

217
00:12:55.571 --> 00:12:56.404
as well.
I,

218
00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:01.450
I don't even remember who else there was people from all over the country coming

219
00:13:01.451 --> 00:13:05.660
in asking about this,
you know,
and,
and needing to sit in and,

220
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:10.240
and they're looking at these egs in particular.
What is it doing?

221
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:15.430
How is it fixing it?
So one,
um,
I think it,
you know,

222
00:13:15.431 --> 00:13:18.850
there's something with what goes on in your brain with,

223
00:13:18.851 --> 00:13:20.650
with the thyroid stuff,

224
00:13:20.651 --> 00:13:24.220
with the endocrine stuff is like getting your damage to your hip without miss.

225
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.270
Right?
And that's like,

226
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:30.700
that kind of directs all of the information that goes to your thyroid,

227
00:13:30.701 --> 00:13:33.010
your thyroid,
you know,
then sends out everything to your body.

228
00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:36.250
And there when there's like a disconnect there.
Um,
no,

229
00:13:36.251 --> 00:13:38.680
it was just screws everything up.
And then on top of it,

230
00:13:38.681 --> 00:13:42.430
like now that we're cutting the same way,
we've always had to cut,

231
00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.070
but we don't get ivs and we,
I mean,
you,

232
00:13:45.071 --> 00:13:50.071
you cannot 100% rehydrate your brain within 45 or 48 hours.

233
00:13:51.671 --> 00:13:56.080
Like you can get your body decently hydrated,
I believe,
but your brain is just,

234
00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:57.580
it's its own thing,
you know.

235
00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:01.780
And so now we don't have ivs or hydraulic system in our brain is down and now

236
00:14:01.781 --> 00:14:06.130
we're rattling it even more like dehydrated.
I mean,
we're just going to have,

237
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:10.930
you know,
bigger side effects,
uh,
Tara brains been dehydr with that now.

238
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:16.030
Um,
the damage that comes to the hippo Thalamus to the pituitary,
to the,

239
00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:20.650
um,
your thyroid,
all of that that goes on there,
that,
that they're,

240
00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:21.970
they're saying that you can,

241
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.630
you can get it firing back at a level that it was before it got hurt.

242
00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:29.920
Like as long as the cells are still alive in it,
they can reenergize those cells.

243
00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.010
Now if you have like just a dead part of your brain,
you know,

244
00:14:33.011 --> 00:14:36.230
they're not bringing it back to life,
but they can,
um,

245
00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:40.930
use these magnets to kind of fluff on backup,
give them back their energy,

246
00:14:40.931 --> 00:14:43.490
their,
their life,
and put in a,

247
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:48.070
put them in back into a functional way that was something similar to you at your

248
00:14:48.071 --> 00:14:51.740
healthiest and,
and make it,
I mean,

249
00:14:51.741 --> 00:14:53.750
not more or less durable just back.

250
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:57.980
<v 1>Right.
And when you,
when you were saying motor skills,
like what was wrong?</v>

251
00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:01.610
Cause that's one of the things that they see in fighters that have taken too

252
00:15:01.611 --> 00:15:05.570
many shots.
They start having you,
they analyze fighters.

253
00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:10.560
Gates in one of the things that happens is your legs get closer together.
Your,

254
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.670
your balance is off your,
your steps are shorter,

255
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:18.230
you don't have that sort of like dynamic fluid motion to your body and you're

256
00:15:18.231 --> 00:15:21.890
having a heart,
a harder time with balance and just motor skill.

257
00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:25.040
<v 0>Yeah,
totally.
So how I felt before going into there,</v>

258
00:15:25.041 --> 00:15:29.000
it was all I had was a gas pedal.
I was like,
just will,
you know,

259
00:15:29.001 --> 00:15:32.450
and just fuck them.
You know,
just cause I,

260
00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.420
I wasn't reading patterns of people anymore.

261
00:15:35.421 --> 00:15:38.810
Like if someone leans this way a little bit,
I'm like,
okay,

262
00:15:38.811 --> 00:15:39.900
I know what you're thinking.

263
00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:43.870
Like if they set this way or that way and even me juking them and like China,

264
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.300
like faint at them.
Like I,
I wasn't,

265
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.820
I couldn't even see the reaction I was making them make,

266
00:15:49.821 --> 00:15:53.690
like I knew what motions in my muscular memory to make them do,

267
00:15:53.691 --> 00:15:57.680
but like I wasn't getting the feedback because it,
it just like wasn't,

268
00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.440
so that was one of the first things I noticed was,
you know,

269
00:16:00.441 --> 00:16:02.080
going back into practice and,

270
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:05.680
and watching people's angles and beating them to it and,
and,

271
00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.930
and like remembering.
And I'm like,
damn,
I don't just have to shoot to shoot.

272
00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:13.460
Like I can wait and do it when it's the right time or I can even like,

273
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:17.060
like take advantage of of the fact that you know,

274
00:16:17.061 --> 00:16:21.050
I'm making them step back or I can flash fire and they're facing and jump on

275
00:16:21.051 --> 00:16:23.210
them at their knee jerk reaction.

276
00:16:23.211 --> 00:16:27.050
You know like these things of like being able to manipulate the situation and

277
00:16:27.051 --> 00:16:28.340
make them adjust to me.

278
00:16:28.341 --> 00:16:32.750
Like I could see that again and I could see you seen before.

279
00:16:32.751 --> 00:16:35.780
Like when I just had go,
all I had was good.

280
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:37.710
<v 1>When you didn't see movement,</v>

281
00:16:37.711 --> 00:16:40.860
like say if someone was going to spin and they're like reload it up their hips.

282
00:16:40.861 --> 00:16:43.920
You didn't see that?
No,
it's just hit hit him first.
What were you seeing?

283
00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.010
<v 0>I,
I didn't,
all I saw was get their first,</v>

284
00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:50.910
all I saw was like closed the distance.
Don't get hit in the head.

285
00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:55.710
Like make like get down and get low and just be a linebacker,

286
00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.700
you know?
And,
and hit him because I knew I wasn't seeing that stuff in.

287
00:16:59.701 --> 00:17:01.050
The more I tried to see it,

288
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.130
the more I would just sit there and wear it cause I'm like any minute now mean

289
00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:06.930
any minute now I'm going to,
I'm going to catch the pattern,

290
00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.850
I'm going to catch the pattern.
And it wasn't popping up.
So then all I had,

291
00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:15.410
<v 1>if you were just like super light sparring,
just moving around,
you didn't see it?</v>

292
00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:21.020
<v 0>No,
no,
not really.
No.
Yeah,
that's fucking terrified.</v>

293
00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:22.920
I was like,
yeah,
it was really scary.

294
00:17:22.921 --> 00:17:27.030
And like even I'd even get to like a good position in Jujitsu and I'd be like,

295
00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.310
I know I know stuff here.
I know I know stuff here.

296
00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.830
But she didn't know what to do.
What was it?
What was it?
What was it?
I know,

297
00:17:31.831 --> 00:17:36.390
I know stuff,
you know,
but like it wasn't like,
especially with adrenaline firing,

298
00:17:36.391 --> 00:17:40.350
like it wasn't just happening for me.
And so like three,

299
00:17:40.351 --> 00:17:41.430
four weeks into that,

300
00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:45.450
all of a sudden like that fog was starting to go down a bit.
Right.

301
00:17:45.451 --> 00:17:49.080
And like part of it was,
and then,
and then I'm also sleeping.

302
00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.570
I have to go before like during like the first week.
Oh yeah.

303
00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.650
Cause every fucking person I went to could fix me.
Right.

304
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:59.490
And you're driving 45 minutes.
Like what the fuck am I doing on it?
Yeah.

305
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:03.300
In a,
in a,
in a car I leased.

306
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:08.760
So all those miles that,
you know,
it's like damn.
And um,

307
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:13.800
it's uh,
it's super frustrating.
Yes.
Everyone can fix me,
everyone can fix me.

308
00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:14.551
And then they don't,

309
00:18:14.551 --> 00:18:17.220
and then my heart's broken again and then I go to the next one and then my

310
00:18:17.221 --> 00:18:19.650
heart's broken again.
And then,
and then the next one said this one,
I'm like,

311
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:20.491
I'm like,

312
00:18:20.491 --> 00:18:24.720
I'm not even going to tell people about this because I'm sick of fucking hitting

313
00:18:24.721 --> 00:18:27.630
up people and being excited about it and telling them to come with me and then

314
00:18:27.631 --> 00:18:30.240
it doesn't work.
And then I'm that guy again,
you know?

315
00:18:30.241 --> 00:18:33.780
And so going into this and then watching it work and then seeing all the other

316
00:18:33.781 --> 00:18:35.550
people that was working for in there that,

317
00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:39.420
and they were never trying to push me to promote it.
They were like,
just come in,

318
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:43.530
just get here.
You know,
and if you like it then tow the cars.

319
00:18:43.531 --> 00:18:47.790
The UFC was talking about getting one of the machines at the Pi and they're kind

320
00:18:47.791 --> 00:18:52.110
of going to have me be like a Guinea pig for it.
Ian Mccall went in there too,

321
00:18:52.111 --> 00:18:53.520
but it didn't like he,

322
00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:58.050
he was doing his own kind of other stuff that was making it so it wasn't working

323
00:18:58.051 --> 00:19:01.200
for him,
but like I was all in,
you know,

324
00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:03.210
it's something that was making it so it wasn't working.

325
00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.720
I don't think he was coming in often.
Oh,
and,
and the thing is,

326
00:19:06.721 --> 00:19:11.580
is that it does stir shit up.
Right?
So like they,
they,
they mess with your,

327
00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:13.980
the,
the levels.
Because again,
they have to,
like,

328
00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:17.700
if the back of your brain is running at four hertz and,
and,
okay,

329
00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:20.730
eight is technically where like you're sleeping,
you're at rest,

330
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.960
there's part of your brains that could be under your resting hurts.
Right?
Well,

331
00:19:24.961 --> 00:19:29.520
the front of your brain is running at 12 so that's like high anxiety,

332
00:19:29.521 --> 00:19:32.250
but like low energy.
And they can,

333
00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:36.170
they can almost tell you how you've been feeling lately,
which was like,
wow,

334
00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:40.350
nuts to me.
Right.
And you could,
they can tell,
you know,
because of this and this,

335
00:19:40.351 --> 00:19:40.531
that,

336
00:19:40.531 --> 00:19:45.360
that you have some OCD tendencies versus this person constantly feels like they

337
00:19:45.361 --> 00:19:46.710
have no energy in their memory,

338
00:19:46.711 --> 00:19:51.390
isn't working in their emotionally and capable of like being in,
you know,

339
00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.240
being a positive force in a relationship right now because they don't have it.

340
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:57.750
So do,
could reach your brain likes hot.
Damn.
I need to get my fuck.
You should.

341
00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.250
You should.
You should.

342
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:02.830
It's scary though because when you see that like little like in there,

343
00:20:02.831 --> 00:20:06.810
you're like,
what's that?
But it's for me,
it's,
that's a two hour drive.
Shit.
Yeah,

344
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:10.160
I know that there,
I don't know if they have anything up here.
I know that they,

345
00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:13.470
they have a bunch all over that is,
let's call it

346
00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.830
<v 1>the website is not coming up,
but this personalized,</v>

347
00:20:15.831 --> 00:20:18.650
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation,

348
00:20:18.651 --> 00:20:22.780
a noninvasive therapeutic approach to the treatment of Ptsd and other neuro

349
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:27.200
neurocognitive disorders.
Uh,
Kevin,
Tim Murphy,
MD,
Vice Chair,

350
00:20:27.201 --> 00:20:32.180
department of radiation and medicine,
applied sciences,
Uc San Diego Director,

351
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:36.800
Pediatric Radiation Oncology Program,
uh,
Rady children's hospital,

352
00:20:36.801 --> 00:20:41.360
San Diego.
Wow.
Yeah.
So that's where you're going.
And um,

353
00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:46.070
I mean obviously during this whole thing you have to be questioning what you do

354
00:20:46.071 --> 00:20:46.900
for a living.

355
00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.040
<v 0>Oh,
well.
And it's like,</v>

356
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.630
<v 1>okay,
so they can fix this.</v>

357
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:54.820
Say they fix it and then I go do it again.
You know,
Cyborg,
right?

358
00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.520
I mean,
you were,
you were thinking about fixing it and you,

359
00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:02.550
you were going from one girl who hits like a dude to another girl who might hit

360
00:21:02.891 --> 00:21:06.310
like a bigger dude.
Yeah.
And cyborgs.
Fucking terrifying.

361
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:10.960
<v 0>And it's like,
I know healthy at my healthiest,
like no problem.</v>

362
00:21:10.961 --> 00:21:13.840
I believe that,
like,
I believe in myself like that,
like,
right.

363
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:18.040
I can figure them out,
especially in find a way to not get hit doing it.

364
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:22.300
Like I didn't get hit in my MMA career,
significant a hit,

365
00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:25.270
not one significant significant hit and tell Amanda.

366
00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:30.040
And then after that I was getting,
if I get lit up right.
And,
and not even that,

367
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.791
even Juliana,

368
00:21:30.791 --> 00:21:34.810
like she kinda opened hand bitch slap me a little bit from the sides,
but I,
and,

369
00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:37.660
but like I can find a way to,

370
00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.300
to like still control it enough to be like,

371
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:44.800
like very effective without taking too much damage.
But like that,

372
00:21:44.801 --> 00:21:49.540
that slow of my,
my motor skills,
my mechanics,
it was,

373
00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:52.810
it was really bothering me.
And that's not how you go fight someone like Cyborg.

374
00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:55.990
You don't go in there with that weight in your pocket.
You know,

375
00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.540
<v 1>it's so important that you're talking about this because this is a,</v>

376
00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:03.650
this is such a factor that we don't see on the outside.

377
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:05.270
Other people,
you know,
other people.

378
00:22:05.271 --> 00:22:07.640
Then the people that are really close to that you talk to about these things.

379
00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:10.010
Like if we were seeing you fight and you know,

380
00:22:10.011 --> 00:22:14.510
when we see the decline of certain fighters,
you know,
you see certain fighters,

381
00:22:14.511 --> 00:22:17.930
they there in a couple really hard fights and then you see a decline,

382
00:22:17.931 --> 00:22:21.680
like a real obvious decline and their skills and their abilities.
Very,

383
00:22:21.681 --> 00:22:24.680
very rarely are they opening up about what's going on.
