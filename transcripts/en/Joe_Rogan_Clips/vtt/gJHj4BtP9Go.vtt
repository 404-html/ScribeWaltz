WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520
That was kind of a quack.
Yeah.
And I was like,
all right,
he did.

2
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.950
Once they start talking about toxins,
you know,
we're cleansing you toxins.
Like,

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.930
oh,
that's a narrative.
Yeah,
it's possible.
Let's not prove it.
Right.

4
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.800
It's just a possible story you tell yourself.
Yeah.
But that term toxins is,

5
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:21.570
so that is like,
there's certain things that people say,
well,
you know,

6
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:25.230
you're dealing with a woo woo woo bullshit here.

7
00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:28.290
And toxins is one of them.
Cleansing and toxins.

8
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:33.240
I'm going on a class and I'm,
I'm,
I'm getting the toxins out of my system.

9
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.480
The scientists are just as guilty as ou is.

10
00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:41.390
Every other guy you think so big time.
In what way?
Oh my God,
man.
Like there's,

11
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.680
there's scientists then there's philosophers of science.

12
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.900
There's so much Wu in science,
even the most popular guys have woo.

13
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.880
They just never studied the philosophy of science.

14
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.220
So they don't really understand what they're saying per say.
Like,

15
00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:55.780
give me an example of we wound,
so I'll give you,
I'll give you a great result.

16
00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.510
Okay.
Okay.
Um,
does this guy named Isaac Newton?
Okay.

17
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.120
All heard of that dude?
Yeah.
And you're asking him,
Hey Isaac,

18
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.570
why don't I fall off the face of the earth?
And he's going to be like,
well,
Joe,

19
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.440
there's this gravity.
This is the force of gravity pulling you down to the earth.

20
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.510
The earth has a greater mass than you.
Therefore it's,

21
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.340
there's this force pulling you down.

22
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.520
We call it gravity and then some guy comes around,
his name is,

23
00:01:17.521 --> 00:01:19.590
is a hobby and he tells,
you know,
Joel,
don't listen to that guy.

24
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.330
I have another theory way more.
It's truer than his.

25
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.740
I believe there are gremlins pulling it down to the earth.
They have last souls.

26
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.110
He's infinite long last was,
and every time you're falling off the earth,

27
00:01:31.111 --> 00:01:33.240
they pull you.
Every time you jump up and down on the earth,

28
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.940
they pull you back down to the earth.
You don't see these gremlins.

29
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:39.300
They're invisible.
But that's what's pulling you down to the earth.
Now,

30
00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:42.270
how do you know who's right and who's wrong?
Who's telling you the truth?

31
00:01:42.271 --> 00:01:43.104
Me Or Isaac.

32
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.200
Isaac lived a long time ago before they actually had provable studies that could

33
00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:53.850
show you why gravity works.
Navy,
one of those studies.
Well,
I'm not a scientist.

34
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.740
Well No,
let me,
let me break it to you this way.

35
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.030
No scientist has a study to prove us that gravity works.
That's the whole thing.

36
00:02:00.031 --> 00:02:01.320
That's,
that's what's scary about.

37
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.310
But he would talk about the university and understand that gravity is in

38
00:02:05.311 --> 00:02:09.390
relation to the size and massive objects.
So the moon is smaller,

39
00:02:09.391 --> 00:02:12.810
therefore it has one six earth's gravity cause it's one quarter the size of the

40
00:02:12.811 --> 00:02:17.100
earth.
There's a standard formula to follow.
There's a correlation.
Now My,

41
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.010
my theory of Gremlins,
which obviously I don't believe it,
right?

42
00:02:20.011 --> 00:02:22.620
I'm using the theological language to make it really sip.

43
00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:24.440
Don't somebody misquote me that I've,
you know,

44
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.680
he doesn't believe in gravity is gravity denier.
Exactly.
Well,
I have,

45
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.130
there's less.
There's less mass on.

46
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.370
There's less items that the moon has less Adams.

47
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.400
Therefore less gremlins lesser than pulling you might might.

48
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.240
Gremlin theory correlates with the gravity theory.
Exactly.

49
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:43.750
But I'm using a myth,

50
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.570
mythical language just to point out that every type of force we're talking about

51
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.630
is an inference.
It's something we project out there.

52
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.410
We don't actually see gravity.
And you know,
later on,
Einstein debunked gravity,

53
00:02:55.411 --> 00:02:59.410
right?
What do you mean by he [inaudible] Isaac was wrong.

54
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.010
<v 1>Isaac,
Isaac's explanation of why you don't fall off the earth was totally wrong.</v>

55
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.190
Well,
what did Einstein due to debunk it?

56
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.590
Einstein taught us that and new theory and new hypothesis that gravity is a

57
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:15.940
pushing force,
not a pulling force.
See Isaac Newton,

58
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.650
he debunked Aristotle
first.

59
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:22.960
We still believe that Aristotle used to say our studies to say,
look,

60
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.310
this thing has a a natural place.

61
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:29.320
It has to be stuck to the earth.
That's his natural place.

62
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.160
It the forces within that one thing.
That's why it doesn't fall off the earth.

63
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:37.120
So when Aristotle saw bird fly,
he said it,
look,
it has levity,

64
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.380
it's natural status to be in the air.
The force that it carries it up in the air.

65
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:46.090
It's within it to within the bird itself.
Isaac Newton came around and said,
no,

66
00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:50.140
that's totally wrong.
Nobody,
no,
no entity can move itself.

67
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.570
It's only a force that's applied.

68
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.700
So let's say you're walking Isaac Newton would say,

69
00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:55.780
you're not pushing yourself forward.

70
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.620
You're pushing the ground beneath you backwards

71
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.040
and that the ground is pushing you forwards so that every action has an opposite

72
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.580
equal reaction.
So when I run,
I'm really pushing the ground behind me.

73
00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:11.560
It sounds like,
like he's splitting hairs,

74
00:04:11.561 --> 00:04:13.780
but he's saying something actually very profound.
He's saying,

75
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.810
you're pushing the earth behind you and the earth is pushing you forward.

76
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.510
There's a reaction there.
So what they do to,

77
00:04:18.511 --> 00:04:21.970
to illustrate that to kids is they take like a train track,
the elevated,

78
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.760
and they turn on the train and then you see the train track starting to spin

79
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.700
underneath the train and it's showing you look,

80
00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:32.110
the train is pushing the train tracks back and the train tracks are pushing the

81
00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:34.330
train forward when they're,
when they're connected to the ground.

82
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.980
So when I put you on a treadmill,
you're pushing the treadmill behind you,

83
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.150
the treadmill's not pushing you forward because it's,

84
00:04:41.151 --> 00:04:43.840
it's spinning along with you.
And if I put you on the ground,

85
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.580
the ground is pushing you forward now.

86
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.300
So for every action is opposite equal reaction.
I'm sure you heard this.

87
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.380
Then Einstein comes along and says,
no,
that's totally wrong.
Well,

88
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.420
when it comes to gravity,
okay,
when subject to gravity says,

89
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.520
because Isaac Newton says this,
look,
he says,
look,

90
00:04:57.521 --> 00:05:01.150
the force of gravity is in the earth.
The earth has this invisible force,

91
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.950
this magical wool thing.
And that's what,

92
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.290
that's what is contemporary set about him.
That's what is pure said.
He said,

93
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.690
you're appealing to magic.
What does gravity thing where it's not,

94
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.680
it's not [inaudible],
it's not material.

95
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.340
It's not made of a substance is this magic?
And he was like,
yeah,

96
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:17.280
it's this forced.
You can't feel it.
You can't detect it.

97
00:05:17.281 --> 00:05:22.030
It's just observable in nature.
And for 300 years,
everybody believed that.

98
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.240
And then I think as long says,
no,
you guys are totally wrong.

99
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.900
There is no mythical force called gravity.
It's a pushing force.

100
00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:32.590
So really what he says is,
Oh sorry,
let me,
let me get a sheet of paper here.

101
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.740
Make it really,
really simple.
And I'm going to put it in a nutshell here.
Okay?

102
00:05:35.741 --> 00:05:38.920
But,
okay,
this is,
he says,
look,
Einstein says,
look,

103
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.730
space and time are one space is actually a thing out there.

104
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.960
It's actually a fee.
The space between me and you is actual physical thing.

105
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.930
He says,
the sun is so heavy that it dents it,
it makes it,

106
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.680
it makes like a totally the ball and the earth is bumping around in that toilet

107
00:05:53.681 --> 00:05:58.100
bowl because space is actually curved.
It's curved like this

108
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.130
<v 0>spaces curve because the sun,
imagine that.
Put something,</v>

109
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.490
a bowling ball on your bed.
You,
your,
your bed's going to indent right?
That bolt,

110
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.950
that toilet bowl shape the world.

111
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.770
The earth is flowing around the toilet bowl shapes.
It's a pushing force.

112
00:06:09.771 --> 00:06:11.000
No longer a pulling force.

113
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.450
So the weight of the earth is pushing down on space.
Exactly.
It's bending space.

114
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:20.480
Literally it's masses bending space.
Now,

115
00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:24.470
Isaac Newton thought lights travels in a straight line only.
And to prove this,

116
00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:28.790
Einstein said,
look,
light will bend.
If I'm right,
light will bend.

117
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.730
So they observe the sun during an eclipse and they saw that the light bends

118
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:35.120
light does not travel in a straight line.
And this was another,
um,
uh,

119
00:06:35.121 --> 00:06:36.200
belief there was debug.
I mean,

120
00:06:36.201 --> 00:06:41.201
how many scientific beliefs are debunked countless or overturned because a

121
00:06:41.481 --> 00:06:45.310
scientific fact is not a mathematical fact are two different things as

122
00:06:45.311 --> 00:06:48.800
scientific fact and never go higher than hypothesis.

123
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.860
If somebody understands the philosophy of science,

124
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.810
he understands that every single scientific fact is not equivalent to a

125
00:06:56.811 --> 00:06:57.710
mathematical fact.

126
00:06:57.711 --> 00:07:02.711
One plus one equals to a scientific fact is always subject to cross examination

127
00:07:03.831 --> 00:07:07.340
and new evidence.
Oh,
you've ever heard of Thomas Kuhn?
He's very famous for that,

128
00:07:07.341 --> 00:07:11.240
right?
We have a paradigm.
So during Aristotle's time he had a paradigm.

129
00:07:11.241 --> 00:07:13.970
You thought the sun goes around the earth.
It was an observational,

130
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.110
scientific fact.
Every day he saw the sun go around the earth.
Literally he said,

131
00:07:18.111 --> 00:07:21.380
look guys,
I'm using my senses to observe the sun go around the earth.

132
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.470
And then one day we find that no,
that's an optical illusion.

133
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.410
It's not true that the sun goes around.
The earth is the earth,

134
00:07:27.411 --> 00:07:30.530
goes around the sun side,
the scientific revolution,

135
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:34.970
every scientific fact we have,
or theory,
including gravity,

136
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.590
because gravity became the law of gravity.

137
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.800
It wasn't the longer the theory of gravity,
it was so accepted,

138
00:07:38.801 --> 00:07:40.880
it became the law of gravity.
Today we don't,

139
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.180
we don't understand gravity as Einstein understood it.
Excuse me,

140
00:07:44.181 --> 00:07:46.760
as Isaac Newton understood.
We understand it completely backwards,

141
00:07:46.761 --> 00:07:47.720
literally backwards now.

142
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.590
And that's true with every scientific theory because science is always subject

143
00:07:51.591 --> 00:07:53.550
to new evidence coming to light where,

144
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.360
but the difference between Isaac Newton living like when,

145
00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.660
whenever the fuck he lived so long ass time ago,

146
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.490
CNG years ago versus the science that we're dealing with today.

147
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.350
Like it's a science today.
But what we'll,

148
00:08:03.351 --> 00:08:08.180
we'll do you see in the science of today?
Um Oh,
the biggest culprit.
Yes.

149
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.340
A randomness.
See,

150
00:08:10.341 --> 00:08:13.010
it's funny because I heard you this conversation with the Sam Harris on

151
00:08:13.011 --> 00:08:15.170
randomness,
which I love by the way.
You did a great job.

152
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.070
I thought it was a great conversation.
However,
he was giving you my opinion,

153
00:08:19.071 --> 00:08:21.320
two contradictory ideas.
Who's tell you,
look,
the world is determined,

154
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.600
but also there'll be random events.

155
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:27.410
And I found that all he was actually talking about determinism versus free will,

156
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.000
right?
Yeah.
So the idea of being that you don't necessarily have free will,

157
00:08:32.001 --> 00:08:35.270
that everything about your decisions and what you're going to do is based on

158
00:08:35.271 --> 00:08:37.460
your life experiences,
your genetics,

159
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:40.640
all these variables that are essentially out of your control.

160
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.430
So this idea of free will is an illusion,

161
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
which is a really complex conversation and I think you could see it in both

162
00:08:49.011 --> 00:08:49.431
ways.

163
00:08:49.431 --> 00:08:54.431
I think you do have a certain amount of control of your decisions and I think

164
00:08:54.801 --> 00:08:59.190
you were shaped very much so by your past and your genetics and your

165
00:08:59.191 --> 00:09:01.470
interpretation of those events.

166
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:04.830
What are those interpretations of those events though?

167
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:08.130
And why do you make those determinations?
W who,
who's,

168
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:12.450
who's in your head pulling the gears?
Like what,
what are you,

169
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.620
I'm a hard determinist.

170
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:17.640
Like I'm a very hard determinist determinist extremist.

171
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.340
So,
but do you believe in free will?
I also believe in free will,
which is,

172
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.010
which is tricky.
It's just tricky.
But I think that's,
it's true.

173
00:09:26.011 --> 00:09:29.220
A potting the both further examination.
I think that's there's,

174
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:33.290
there is something that allows people to,
I mean,
what,

175
00:09:33.291 --> 00:09:36.990
what takes the guy was 500 pounds and all of sudden he goes on a Keto diet and

176
00:09:36.991 --> 00:09:39.690
starts running and w who starts walking in the knee,

177
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.680
he sends you a picture on Twitter.
I lost 179 pounds in six months.
You're like,

178
00:09:43.681 --> 00:09:45.810
Holy Shit,
how the fuck did you do?

179
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.020
Like that guy has a fucking wheel man to say that.

180
00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:53.370
That's his whole life and his life experiences and as genetics it's like,

181
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.780
yes,
I could see what you're saying.
I could see that he,

182
00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:01.080
he had enough because of his life experiences and that led to him making this

183
00:10:01.081 --> 00:10:04.230
change.
But this is a tremendous amount of will involved in that.

184
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.660
And to deny that seems like you're denying the spirit of human beings.
Well,

185
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.060
let's look at it this way.
Okay,
real quick,
let's look at it like,
okay,

186
00:10:12.061 --> 00:10:16.920
let's say a couple of this piece of paper
and I'm going to catapult it,
okay?

187
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:21.300
And it landed there,
right?
And I'm going to reset the entire universe.

188
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:25.770
I'm going to reset every molecule of air,
every fiber in this paper,

189
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.390
you're going to be in the exact same spot.

190
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.800
The whole universe has been reset and a fire.

191
00:10:29.801 --> 00:10:33.960
It again isn't going to land exactly where it landed the first time,

192
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.040
or is it going to land somewhere else?
I've reset the universe.

193
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:43.080
The earth was the earth.
Every molecule of matter in the,
every,

194
00:10:43.081 --> 00:10:43.650
every,

195
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:47.280
every particle of matter in the universe has been reset with the same amount of

196
00:10:47.281 --> 00:10:49.080
force.
Everything is identical.

197
00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:53.310
I would assume if the same amount of space and the same amount of air,

198
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.310
you would land the same spot infinitely.
Precisely.

199
00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:01.920
I don't know what every set everything perfectly.
If,
if infinitely precisely.

200
00:11:01.921 --> 00:11:02.870
You throw it exact,

201
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.750
exact same way and it lands in the exact same dirt with the exact same

202
00:11:06.751 --> 00:11:08.340
resistance.
It's the same thing.

203
00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:12.680
I would assume it's infinitely precisely gonna land the same spot if random,

204
00:11:12.681 --> 00:11:14.820
this is a force at work in nature.

205
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:19.650
Why didn't it factor itself into our little experiment here?

206
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.220
Cause you little experiments,
impossible.
But that's irrelevant.

207
00:11:22.221 --> 00:11:27.090
It's a thought experiment,
but it's not a fun creating logical universe.
Right?

208
00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.910
But it's not logically impossible.
Well,
in that case though,

209
00:11:29.911 --> 00:11:34.110
with the variables that you presented,
yes.
Okay,
well,
where's randomness?

210
00:11:34.111 --> 00:11:38.340
Where's this?
Four is no randomness.
If you're recreating the entire earth in a,

211
00:11:38.341 --> 00:11:42.060
in a very duplicatable way,
that's not randomness at all.
It is random.

212
00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.370
There is no randomness,
right?
Random.

213
00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:48.240
This is when a human being can no longer compute all the factors.
And he,

214
00:11:48.241 --> 00:11:50.760
we use an expression called randomness,
meaning,
okay,

215
00:11:50.761 --> 00:11:54.010
I rolled the dice had landed on on seven randomly.
Why?
Because

216
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:58.930
<v 1>I couldn't compute all the variables.
So the random,
this is kind of a,</v>

217
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.960
it's a,
it's an illusion that we project onto the world.

218
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:06.310
So the plus one of the greatest physicists and history,
okay,
a similar place.

219
00:12:06.311 --> 00:12:09.340
He says,
look,
look at a billiard ball table.
Okay?

220
00:12:09.341 --> 00:12:11.680
If you tell me which way you're going to break the billiard balls,

221
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.860
if you tell me what philocity and what angle you're gonna hit that,
that,

222
00:12:14.861 --> 00:12:15.694
that Cuba,

223
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:20.290
I could tell you where every single ball is going to be on the pool table.

224
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.550
That's what laplace says.
Okay?
He's a phenomenal thinker.
And he says,
why?

225
00:12:24.551 --> 00:12:26.800
Because I'm going to take that table.
I'm going to turn it to a math.

226
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.780
I'm going to take the weight of the ball,
the friction of the table,

227
00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:32.710
the density of the bands,
the the,
the,
the gravity of the earth.
Excuse me.

228
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:34.570
I'm going to take all those variables.

229
00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:36.700
I'm going to put them up on this board here.

230
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.680
All I need to know is how hard you can hit the ball.

231
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.550
And I'll tell you precisely where every ball is going to land.
Now,

232
00:12:42.551 --> 00:12:46.240
somebody who doesn't know mathematics or geometry is going to look at that
table.

233
00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:49.990
When he sees the brake to him.
It's going to seem random but random.

234
00:12:49.991 --> 00:12:51.520
This is really a reflection of his ignorance.

235
00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:53.410
He's not able to compute all this information.

236
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:58.270
That's why the plas says to God the world is not random to somebody who has

237
00:12:58.271 --> 00:13:00.310
information.
The world is not random.

238
00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.530
That's why he says it's very important to sweat.
That's where we're sold.

239
00:13:03.531 --> 00:13:07.600
Determinist cause we believe that what's happening right now is a byproduct of

240
00:13:07.601 --> 00:13:10.930
the past,
the past cause this happening right now.

241
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.630
The past was out of your control.

242
00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:18.370
If I reset the universe and let it play all over again,
I identical circumstance,

243
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:21.040
you would drink that exact same amount of coffee you had today.

244
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:23.380
You would've made the same.
You would just married the same woman,

245
00:13:23.381 --> 00:13:25.720
you would have had the same kids,
you would have had the same t shirt on.

246
00:13:25.721 --> 00:13:29.110
Right now,
you'd have the Mike at the same.
This everything would be reset.

247
00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.870
So when we look at the world through the eyes of physics,

248
00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:36.970
they say the cause of Linus completes the cause of line is complete.

249
00:13:36.971 --> 00:13:41.860
Meaning where is this space for randomness or freewill?
It.

250
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:43.120
We don't factor it in.

251
00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:47.290
The only time we do factor it in is when we look at ourselves inwardly.

252
00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.110
But when we look at the world objectively as a third person,

253
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.250
so there's two views.
There's the internal view.
First person experience.

254
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.990
We don't believe,
we don't believe in determinism where we have free will.

255
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.520
That's the first person experience.
Third Person Experience.
I'm studying Joe.

256
00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:06.700
All I see in Joe is billiard balls.
So when you have a thought,

257
00:14:06.701 --> 00:14:08.200
it's all billiard balls hitting one another.

258
00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:12.970
And if I had an infinitely precise calculator according to the plus,

259
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.760
I could tell you where you're going to be five years from now,

260
00:14:15.761 --> 00:14:17.140
what you're going to be doing.
Why?

261
00:14:17.141 --> 00:14:20.650
Because I'm seeing one billiard ball hit another.
It's just take that pool table,

262
00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:24.490
experiment and make it the greatest pool game in history,

263
00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:26.710
there are countless atoms.

264
00:14:26.711 --> 00:14:28.960
There are countless billiard balls striking into one another.

265
00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:33.380
Somebody can calculate the world of physics and tell you where your hands going

266
00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:34.061
to be.
Laplace says,

267
00:14:34.061 --> 00:14:36.100
I'm going to tell you where your hand's going to be in five years from now,

268
00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.130
but you don't know my personal choices.
I'm going to make it.
That's irrelevant.

269
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.530
That's a way he'll tell you.
That's irrelevant.
Why?

270
00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:44.500
Cause he sees the billiard balls moving inside your mind,
so to speak.

271
00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:49.960
Now Leipnetz reconcile the two because see,
for instance,
when I,

272
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:53.780
when I living in the first person,
this is my intuition.
I'm like,
Hey,

273
00:14:53.781 --> 00:14:56.940
I grabbed that Coffee Cup of coffee.
I had this internal experience.

274
00:14:56.941 --> 00:15:01.640
It's outside of physics.
So lemon is gives a great example.
He says,
look,

275
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.180
if I was really,
really tiny and I'd walk around in your mind,

276
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.020
I would see blood flow.
I would see neurons firing.

277
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:12.860
I would see all sorts of biological,
uh,
interactions,

278
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:17.070
but I wouldn't see anything of consciousness.
I wouldn't see your thoughts.

279
00:15:17.071 --> 00:15:20.730
I wouldn't see you thinking about your wife,
a hearing your child's voice,

280
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:23.160
thinking about what you want to have for dinner.
I wouldn't see any of that.

281
00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:27.450
I would just see billiard balls hitting one another.
However,

282
00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.810
now that I'm having this first person experience,

283
00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.930
there's something we call intuition.
This first person experience itself,

284
00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:37.890
you're having this spiritual type of transcendent experience.

285
00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:42.240
What it's like to have a thought,
what it's like to be me.
So for instance,

286
00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:47.130
I see the cup of coffee,
I desire the cup of coffee and I drink it.

287
00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:50.970
Science says nothing has no information about my conscious experience.

288
00:15:50.971 --> 00:15:54.340
My intuitive experience.
Science is not absolute.

289
00:15:54.341 --> 00:15:56.070
They cannot tell me everything about the universe.

290
00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:59.250
It could only tell me about the billiard balls.
It can only go so far.

291
00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.160
At that point it has to stop because it doesn't have,
we don't,

292
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:07.360
our census cannot sense the conscious experience that we're having.

293
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.070
The conscious experience has only known intuitively.
So first person experience,

294
00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:15.670
so 11 it says this.
It says,
look,
you look at the world when you study the world,

295
00:16:15.671 --> 00:16:18.670
we're all seeing billiard balls hitting one another.
Nobody argues about that.

296
00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:22.960
However,
our intuition is telling us that's all untrue.
We have the chat,

297
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.650
we have the ability to move our own hand,
desire something,
grab something,

298
00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.640
eat something,
consumed something,
make a choice.
And he says,
how are the two,

299
00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:32.230
how could they coexist?

300
00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:36.670
Because remember in reason for me to accept something as logically true,

301
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:40.690
after eliminate every other possibility.
So he found the one possibility,

302
00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:45.460
one possibility that till today it's never been refuted.
He says,

303
00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:49.330
he calls it the twin trains.
So picture two trains.
Okay?

304
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:53.770
They're going up and down,
side by side,
traveling at the same speed.

305
00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:57.520
They look like they're connected to one another,
but they're not.

306
00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:01.360
They're just synchronized.
Every time one goes left,
the other one goes left,

307
00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:06.370
one goes up,
one goes down.
And so when I lighten this tells you this,
says,
look,

308
00:17:06.371 --> 00:17:07.780
when you reach for that cup of coffee,

309
00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:11.740
the universe had already decided millions of billions of years ago that that was

310
00:17:11.741 --> 00:17:15.640
going to happen.
Your intuitive sense just coincides with it perfectly.

311
00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:20.310
And he said,
that's what he calls the twin trains theory.

312
00:17:20.311 --> 00:17:25.311
That the correlation theory that your desire to grab that cup of coffee doesn't

313
00:17:26.131 --> 00:17:28.680
affect your hand,
does not move your hand.
That'll be impossible.

314
00:17:28.681 --> 00:17:30.990
There'll be something nonphysical moving,
something physical.

315
00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:33.720
So he says that they're just correlated perfectly.

316
00:17:33.721 --> 00:17:36.870
When you ask them how do they correlate so perfectly,
he says,
well,
God,

317
00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.510
it's like God took the girls the greatest pool shot in history.

318
00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:46.280
This is [inaudible].
This is a,
he's a,
he's the guy who invented the calculus,

319
00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.980
the binary code,
you know,
like w all our computers.
So work cause of the cause

320
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:50.813
<v 0>of Lebanon's.</v>

321
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:57.600
That to me is a hard sell.
Yeah.
So most people can't wrap their mind around it.

322
00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:00.180
Yeah.
It's a hard sell.
First of all,

323
00:18:00.181 --> 00:18:05.100
he can put a woman can created the first computer code.
Uh,
he,

324
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.710
he invented that binary code,
binary Kaline,
Enrico.
Not Computer Call,

325
00:18:08.711 --> 00:18:12.660
but the base on binary.
Now when he's saying he's saying this,

326
00:18:12.661 --> 00:18:16.950
that your desire coincides with the universe having this,

327
00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:20.700
that seems like a lot of woo.
That seems like a bit of a stretch.

328
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:22.320
That's an interesting point.
Tell me why.
Well,

329
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:27.030
why would the universe have a plan for you and your mother?
He's saying,
God,

330
00:18:27.031 --> 00:18:31.620
he's saying God directly.
Well,
prove that.
Okay.
That's a great,

331
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:35.910
that's a great,
that's a great objection.
Why would you say that it would be gone?

332
00:18:35.911 --> 00:18:37.350
It's argument.
It wasn't to proof God.

333
00:18:37.351 --> 00:18:42.180
This argument was to tell you that this is a possibility.

334
00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:46.020
Why you freewill is true and so as determinism.
Yes,

335
00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:49.230
because can you deny freewill aren't you're having a direct experience of free

336
00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:53.550
will?
Well,
the only denial of freewill would be determinism.

337
00:18:53.551 --> 00:18:57.780
The only denial would be that your idea of free will is an illusion is you are

338
00:18:57.781 --> 00:19:01.440
really shaped by the momentum of your past,
your genetics,

339
00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:03.240
live experiences,

340
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:07.860
all the variables and the way you've absorbed emotions and interactions with

341
00:19:07.861 --> 00:19:09.570
people and that these are flavored.

342
00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:13.230
Your very being to the point when when presented with an obstacle or an

343
00:19:13.231 --> 00:19:14.460
opportunity or a thing,

344
00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:18.690
there is a predetermined solution in your mind for whatever the situation is.

345
00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.930
That's determinism.
Okay?
So let,
let's,
uh,
let's,

346
00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:23.880
let's say action rather than solution.

347
00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:27.150
Let's take a step back and look at what live minutes is trying to say.
Okay?

348
00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:30.080
He's trying to say,
look,
there's three ways of knowing something and yeah,

349
00:19:30.081 --> 00:19:33.060
you have to decide this is a brilliant human being.
Okay.
And not many,
many,

350
00:19:33.061 --> 00:19:36.530
many men have have said the same thing throughout history.
Let's,

351
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:39.630
let's just at least entertain it.
He says,
look,

352
00:19:39.631 --> 00:19:43.640
you know something empirically through your senses,
okay,

353
00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.190
you touch fire,
it's hot.
Then you can know something.

354
00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:50.640
Deductively one plus one equals two via logic.

355
00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:55.620
Then you could know something intuitively meaning direct first experience.

356
00:19:56.130 --> 00:20:00.900
Okay,
so let's that.
So let's say,
um,
let's say you tell me,

357
00:20:00.901 --> 00:20:05.700
um,
I dunno.
Um,
I've had the coffee tastes great.

358
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:10.140
You don't know that deductively or empirically the sensation of coffee tasting

359
00:20:10.141 --> 00:20:14.940
great is known intuitively direct meaning there is no,
um,

360
00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:19.970
there is no interpreter and philosophy of something called the egocentric

361
00:20:20.071 --> 00:20:20.904
predicament.

362
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:26.430
So right now you're experiencing this entire room within your consciousness,

363
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.480
right?
[inaudible] I might be outside of Your Eagle,
but I'm,

364
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.640
I'm occurring right now in your consciousness.

365
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:38.430
You see the different perceiving you.
So yeah,
in my consciousness,
yes.

366
00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:43.260
Or with my consciousness,
which is connected to my senses.

367
00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.810
Is there anything you can perceive outside of your consciousness?

368
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.750
Well,
that's a weird say way of saying something that's imposed anything but

369
00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:56.840
perceiving outside of my consciousness.
Meaning not being,

370
00:20:57.290 --> 00:21:01.610
not conscious,
but yet still perceiving.
No.
When you perceive something,

371
00:21:01.611 --> 00:21:04.130
it has to be within your consciousness,
right?

372
00:21:04.131 --> 00:21:07.130
You have to or with your consciousness,
right?

373
00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:10.490
It cannot be outside of your branch.
So even if something touches your skin,

374
00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:15.310
you're consciously recognizing that it touches your skin.
Um,

375
00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.940
the egocentric predicament is more about your whole universe is made up of your

376
00:21:19.941 --> 00:21:20.600
consciousness.

377
00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:24.680
You cannot sense anything or experience anything or get any information outside

378
00:21:24.681 --> 00:21:27.200
of your conscious.
Like camp was very big on this.
He's like,
look this,

379
00:21:27.201 --> 00:21:31.340
this is called idealism and the whole world is happening on inside your head,

380
00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:33.620
right?
Supposedly likes,
for instance,
you see this cup of coffee,

381
00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:37.620
they're gonna say like clusters hit the cup of coffee.
It goes in your eye,

382
00:21:37.621 --> 00:21:40.160
your eye,
your eye.
It gives your brain a signal.
You're sick.

383
00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:42.770
Your brain interprets the signal and creates this universe around you.

384
00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:45.410
Creates this image.
The theater of your mind.
Yeah.

385
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:48.770
Can you experience anything outside of the theater of your mind?

386
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:56.410
Very difficult to argue that you could.
It's impossible.
Yeah.

387
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:59.590
According to all the philosophers in history,
we,
we can't,
we cannot.

388
00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:01.810
This is called the egocentric particular.

389
00:22:01.811 --> 00:22:05.920
What about subconscious that will be still happening inside your conscious mind?

390
00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.340
So subconscious is still some what?

391
00:22:09.341 --> 00:22:13.540
Conscious in some way?
Yes.
It will be whatever.

392
00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:17.560
Whatever you would perceive would be happening in your conscious mind would just

393
00:22:17.561 --> 00:22:20.950
be outside of your standard awareness.
Now the scary thing is is that we have,

394
00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:24.580
we make a lot of inferences and that's where the wool wool comes in.

395
00:22:24.581 --> 00:22:25.201
Everything is will,

396
00:22:25.201 --> 00:22:29.320
will you think just he think just everything outside of sides is what woo

397
00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:32.200
sciences just as Wu was everyone else's.
You keep saying that,

398
00:22:32.201 --> 00:22:34.810
but I don't understand why you're saying it because you haven't made a good

399
00:22:34.811 --> 00:22:35.471
example.
Okay.

400
00:22:35.471 --> 00:22:38.590
We'll only example that you said was that they changed the way they look at

401
00:22:38.591 --> 00:22:41.660
gravity when new information was presented,
right.
That doesn't equal.
We'll,

402
00:22:41.661 --> 00:22:46.100
we'll gravity was Wu will.
It was a magical force.
My grandma,
my grandma,

403
00:22:46.101 --> 00:22:49.090
think about gravity in terms of people that didn't even,

404
00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:52.750
didn't have phones,
they didn't have cars,

405
00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.820
they didn't have paved roads.
I mean,

406
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.570
you're dealing with a very primitive notion of what gravity was.

407
00:22:58.571 --> 00:23:02.800
It was a very interesting idea that has since been proven to be true.

408
00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:08.050
False gravity,
Newtonian gravity.
Okay.
Has been proven to be false,

409
00:23:08.051 --> 00:23:10.960
but gravity is still real,
right?

410
00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.530
Not we're using the same word for a completely different idea,
okay,

411
00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:20.350
so Newton's gravity was magical.
It was an appeal to magic.
Okay,
here it is.

412
00:23:20.351 --> 00:23:24.820
Here is gravity is different than Einstein's gravity and that Einstein's gravity

413
00:23:24.821 --> 00:23:26.680
is what's been proven,
right?

414
00:23:26.681 --> 00:23:29.830
We know now that light does bend around the mass of the sun,

415
00:23:29.831 --> 00:23:33.220
which is one of the reasons why we have a hard time seeing asteroids that are

416
00:23:33.221 --> 00:23:38.050
coming from behind the sun because the mass of the sun actually Ben Space Time

417
00:23:38.051 --> 00:23:41.680
around it to the point where it distorts our view.
It's our new narrative.

418
00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:42.543
It's not proven.

419
00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:46.670
You can never prove a scientific fact past the level of hypothesis.

420
00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.400
It's weird.
I know it sounds strange,

421
00:23:49.401 --> 00:23:51.560
but what do you mean pass the level of hypothesis?

422
00:23:51.561 --> 00:23:56.561
If you can prove it in studies and tests and you still don't buy it,

423
00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.420
you have not eliminated every other possibility.
Okay,

424
00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:02.610
so it's not the same as a logical fi.
How is that?
Whoa,
this is,

425
00:24:02.611 --> 00:24:07.190
this is understood in,
in,
in like in the philosophy of science.

426
00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.900
It's quick.
It's comfortably accepted.

427
00:24:08.901 --> 00:24:10.850
It's not anti science like I'm not trying to say anything.
I know.

428
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:12.090
I know you're not,
but you're going to love it.

429
00:24:12.091 --> 00:24:15.830
You were saying that science has so much woo and I'm not seeing the woo.

430
00:24:15.831 --> 00:24:20.831
Part of what I'm seeing is the necessary testing and the idea of incorporating

431
00:24:23.121 --> 00:24:26.600
new data or changing beliefs and ideas.

432
00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:28.210
This is quite a,

433
00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:30.440
it's a bit of a difficult thing to wrap your mind off it in one day,

434
00:24:30.441 --> 00:24:33.230
but you have to think about it and throughout time you [inaudible] it comes to

435
00:24:33.231 --> 00:24:35.780
clearer and clearer.
When we observe the universe,

436
00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:38.510
all we see is patterns and regularities found in nature.
That's it.

437
00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:41.030
We don't see actual physical laws.

438
00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.970
The physical laws are bookmarks inside our mind.

439
00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:46.220
We see the same pattern over and over again,

440
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:48.470
and then we attribute a physical law,

441
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:53.970
<v 1>but that physical art doesn't exist out there.
So here,
here's a great example.</v>

442
00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:56.880
Okay?
Okay.
Let me give you a great example.
Okay.

443
00:24:56.881 --> 00:24:58.860
Let's say I'm about to flip a coin.
Okay.

444
00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:02.400
[inaudible] now you're going to tell me it's probably going to land on heads or

445
00:25:02.401 --> 00:25:03.420
tails.
Yeah.

446
00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:08.520
[inaudible] do you know that logically or is it based on your history with
coins?

447
00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:14.220
I know it logically and based on my history of coins.
Perfect.
I'm arguing.

448
00:25:14.221 --> 00:25:17.880
You don't know it logically.
You only know what on your past history.
Okay,

449
00:25:17.881 --> 00:25:20.760
so pay attention to this.
This is,
this is a little bit weird.

450
00:25:20.761 --> 00:25:23.830
This is what we got to.
We had to go slow.
It gets a very weird,
okay?
It's very,
uh,

451
00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:27.360
it goes against our instincts.
Okay?
Erase all your history with coins.

452
00:25:27.361 --> 00:25:30.600
You've never seen a coin before,
okay?
And I flip it right?

453
00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:33.740
And now it turns into a butterfly.
You've never seen a coin before.

454
00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.630
It doesn't surprise you.
You're like,
well,
turn into a butterfly.

455
00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:40.170
And I flipped a coin a hundred times in front of you a hundred times.

456
00:25:40.171 --> 00:25:43.030
It turns into a butterfly.
Now I'm going to flip the coin a hundred,

457
00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:46.470
the hundred and one time.
You can be like,
I bet you it turns into a butterfly.

458
00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:51.980
<v 0>That's how we express science.
We see the patterns and regularities,</v>

459
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:55.010
then we,
we predict them science.

460
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:57.330
<v 1>This is good.
This is a little bit,
this is a good way to put it.</v>

461
00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.010
Science is the faith.

462
00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:04.050
It's faith that the future will behave like the past.

463
00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:07.230
<v 0>Science is faith</v>

464
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.920
<v 1>that the future will behave like the past.</v>

465
00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:14.130
So now you've developed a faith that this coin will flip into a butterfly

466
00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:17.090
and now you can predict it.

467
00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:23.280
<v 0>Wouldn't you say that science is the use of measurement to understand matter and</v>

468
00:26:25.601 --> 00:26:26.740
things around us?

469
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:31.950
I wouldn't say that it's using the past to predict a future.

470
00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:37.200
I would say that if you know that fire melts led at a certain temperature and

471
00:26:38.171 --> 00:26:42.910
this is provable,
and then you can show this over and over again.

472
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:46.710
Here's what we know about fire and reaches a certain temperature.

473
00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:51.210
When led reaches a certain temperature,
it melts.
It changes its form.

474
00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:56.050
Whereas if you want to do that same test to carbon based,

475
00:26:56.051 --> 00:27:00.270
steal a requires far greater temperatures and then we know that there's

476
00:27:00.271 --> 00:27:03.420
variables in matter.
This is,
this is not,

477
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:07.890
this is something that you can prove and show.
There's no woo to that.
Okay.

478
00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:12.750
Water boils at how many degrees?
I think it's two 50 and in southeast,

479
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.750
a hundred degrees Celsius.
I Dunno what Fahrenheit.
Oh,

480
00:27:15.751 --> 00:27:18.900
you Canadians with your wacky metric system.

481
00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:20.910
Is that a side effect?

482
00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:26.520
Is it a scientific fact that water boils at a certain temperature?
Yes.
Actually,

483
00:27:26.521 --> 00:27:29.460
no.
It's not,
they can boil water now they can.

484
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:33.780
Water can resist boiling up to 200 degrees Celsius if you put it in a certain

485
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:38.550
atmospheric atmospheric pressure and then suspended in a certain liquid.

486
00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:42.310
If you change the circumstance,
suspend water and liquids,

487
00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:45.840
they suspended in a particular liquid that's,
that's not heated or cooled.

488
00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:47.430
Alright?
It's not,
it's not supposed to.

489
00:27:47.431 --> 00:27:49.440
It doesn't affect the temperature of the water itself.

490
00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.230
And now water can boil at 200 degrees.
Okay,

491
00:27:52.231 --> 00:27:54.630
so you're doing something different to water.
That's,

492
00:27:54.631 --> 00:27:57.480
I think you're taking it outside of the normal earth environment.

493
00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:01.350
So the variables also include Earth's environment.
Agreed.

494
00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:05.250
But water doesn't inherently boil at a hundred degrees.

495
00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:10.650
It's not a fact.
But we believe that to be a scientific,
we believe that water,

496
00:28:10.651 --> 00:28:12.750
if it gets to a hundred degrees,
is boiling.
It's going to behave this way.

497
00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:15.810
As a matter of fact,
no.
There are many other things that,

498
00:28:15.811 --> 00:28:18.240
that that fact has been debunked and there's countless amount of facts.

499
00:28:18.241 --> 00:28:18.810
Like wait a minute,

500
00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:22.950
is that the facts have been debunked or is that when you add in sufficient

501
00:28:22.951 --> 00:28:24.270
external variables,

502
00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:29.450
then water takes longer to boil because of these variables playing into yes.

503
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:32.520
The,
the properties that we already observed with water.

504
00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:34.240
That's why whenever we have a scientific factor,

505
00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:38.040
might be new information coming to,
to change our view,

506
00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:41.550
change our view of this fact.
This is not necessarily new information.

507
00:28:41.551 --> 00:28:44.700
What this is,
is new,
additional,
precise,
more precise information.

508
00:28:44.701 --> 00:28:46.230
But what you're talking about with water,

509
00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:50.370
you're talking about additional variables.
Like that's just more science.

510
00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:52.980
That's not woo.
Okay,
well here's some cool,
okay.

511
00:28:52.981 --> 00:28:56.710
This is because we talk about gravity was woo.
Like hey random,
this was whew.

512
00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.900
Okay.
Cause we,
we cannot find one instance of actual randomness.

513
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:03.180
The causal line is complete as Laplas would say.

514
00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:04.530
There's no randomness in the world.

515
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:07.850
So the randomness ideas is just our inability to calculate exactly.

516
00:29:07.851 --> 00:29:12.090
Believably difficult variables.
Exactly.
But the,
it's,

517
00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:16.020
it's a projection of your increments.
If you knew you wouldn't be random.
So,

518
00:29:16.021 --> 00:29:18.690
for instance,
um,
I can't remember who coined the term,
but they say,

519
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:22.590
the man who says the tallest mountain I've ever seen is the tallest mountain

520
00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:26.280
he's making himself.
The measure of truth.
I measure truth.

521
00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:30.330
If you take that perspective,
you're the center of truth.
I'm truth.

522
00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.690
There's nothing outside of me that's true.
Then you see randomness everywhere.

523
00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:35.760
However,
if you believe in correspondence theory,

524
00:29:35.761 --> 00:29:39.030
that truth is independent of me and you,
which I think most of us will agree,

525
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:41.980
then random is,
doesn't exist in that context because

526
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:42.391
<v 1>randomness,</v>

527
00:29:42.391 --> 00:29:46.480
it only depends on you and when things are true outside of your beliefs,
right?

528
00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:48.430
Let's take another classic.
We'll,
we'll term,

529
00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:52.000
I know this is a very advanced philosophy.
I know it sounds crazy,
okay?

530
00:29:52.001 --> 00:29:55.930
But this is,
this is,
this is what the greatest thinkers in history,
in a report,

531
00:29:56.170 --> 00:30:00.700
okay?
With what they've written down,
okay?
Okay.
See this,
uh,

532
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.310
you see a knife?
I,
let's look at Aristotle's theory of knives.
Okay?
Says,
look at,

533
00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.730
look at this slide.
I show you a plastic knife.
I show you a wooden knife.

534
00:30:06.731 --> 00:30:10.420
I show you a metal knife.
I show you five different knives and you're like,

535
00:30:10.421 --> 00:30:13.450
they're all knives.
All of them are knives.
You pointed them and say their knives.

536
00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:18.010
Aristotle says,
look,
they all share in one something.

537
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:22.360
Let's call it the essence that makes them all knives.
Would you agree?

538
00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:26.590
The form they all share,
they fight,
draw knife on a paper and be like,

539
00:30:26.591 --> 00:30:28.900
he just drew a knife.
That knife on the paper.

540
00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:32.530
Share something with a knife made of steel.
The knife made of plastic.
Okay.

541
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:35.620
The knife made of wood.
The form.
There's something about it.

542
00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.420
We call it the essence in philosophy.
Okay?

543
00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:40.030
The form might be confused with what a Plato says.

544
00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:44.110
Split on how the whole thing about forms,
but let's call it for now essence.
Okay?

545
00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:48.600
If you change the essence,
you change the thing.
So if I take that piece of that,

546
00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:51.530
if I take that plastic a knife and I melt it,

547
00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.880
you realize it's not a knife anymore,
right?
Why?
What did I do?

548
00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.410
You change that thing about it.

549
00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:59.880
That essence right now,
that essence,

550
00:30:59.881 --> 00:31:02.940
does it exist out there in the world or is it only in your head you made it up?

551
00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:04.600
<v 2>Okay.</v>

552
00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:09.050
<v 1>Well,
by calling in essence,
you're confusing me,
so I would call it the form.
Okay.</v>

553
00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:10.010
The form of it,

554
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:14.470
it sort of exists in culture that exists in our understanding of these objects

555
00:31:14.471 --> 00:31:18.010
and then useful shapes.
It's you,
it's your,
your idea of,

556
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:21.760
of knife conforms to that knife out there.
Where's that knife right here?

557
00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:25.390
That's a great,
yeah.
Bring it out.
You can see it.
Great.
It's obviously a knife.

558
00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:30.280
Yes.
Right.
You recognize it or recognize it.
That's a knife.
Yeah.
I totally agree.

559
00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:34.960
Mike.
Model of Nice.
Yeah.
My motto of knife that fits my model.

560
00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:38.470
Mine is beautiful,
but there's some weird looking knives out there too.
Sure.

561
00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:40.960
And there might be a knife where we don't agree.
That's a night.

562
00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:42.310
You think it's an f?
I don't agree.
That's,

563
00:31:42.311 --> 00:31:44.850
I think that's a sword reached a level of sorts,
right?
Yeah.

564
00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.950
We might have a different that.
That's great evidence.

565
00:31:47.951 --> 00:31:51.280
That's something in our minds,
not actually objective.
Right,
right,
right.

566
00:31:51.281 --> 00:31:55.450
They get to the certain length.
It's subjective.
It's subjective,
right?
Right.
Okay.

567
00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.850
Let's look at matter now matter.
Okay?
It's an inference of the mind.

568
00:31:59.851 --> 00:32:02.040
Just like the,
the knife is an inference of the mind

569
00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:08.270
in terms of subatomic particles and atoms.
And you see this cup,

570
00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:13.220
you see this bottle?
Yes.
You see this clock?
Yes.
You made an inference.

571
00:32:13.221 --> 00:32:16.010
They all share one thing.
What did they share?
All of them share one thing.

572
00:32:16.011 --> 00:32:20.400
What does that thing they share?
They share this thing called matter.
Okay.

573
00:32:20.401 --> 00:32:21.570
But that's,
that was an inference.

574
00:32:21.571 --> 00:32:26.190
Just like we inferred the essence of a knife matter has never been observed in

575
00:32:26.191 --> 00:32:29.460
nature.
Matter is a byproduct of our mind.

576
00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:30.980
<v 2>Okay,</v>

577
00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:35.860
<v 1>so when you see a tree,
hmm,
you're not seeing matter.
There's no matter is only,</v>

578
00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:40.370
not that I'm inferring matter,
I'm observing an image.
Right?
But I'm inferring

579
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:42.830
<v 0>the matter.
The matter is,
it is a mental construct.</v>

580
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:48.730
Is it a mental construct or is it our inability to see things smaller than what

581
00:32:50.631 --> 00:32:54.230
is necessary for our survival?
Like we can't see Adam's,

582
00:32:54.231 --> 00:32:57.980
we can't see subatomic particles.
We can't see them with the naked eye.

583
00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:01.880
But we understand through science that they exist.

584
00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:03.860
How do you understand that they exist?

585
00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:06.650
Are you seeing that matter exists out there independently of your mind?

586
00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.810
Is matter objective or is it dependent on your mind to exist?

587
00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.510
It's not dependent on your mind to exist.

588
00:33:14.511 --> 00:33:17.060
It's too dependent upon your mind to observe your,

589
00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:21.500
you need your mind to be able to observe matter.
Okay.
So matter,

590
00:33:21.501 --> 00:33:26.030
if you didn't exist,
do you think this table would exist?
That,
I dunno.
Right?

591
00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:27.470
But what would you guess?

592
00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:31.190
I would guess that all I know if I'm going to use Ockham's razor,
you know,

593
00:33:31.191 --> 00:33:33.680
if you've heard of aqua,
if I'm going to go to the extreme with Ockham's razor,

594
00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:39.530
I'm just going to believe what I observe.
Okay.
Kill all the wool.
Kill it all.

595
00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:43.550
You have had loved one die,
right?
Yeah.
Everyone has.
Right?
Um,

596
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:47.270
do you assume that when they die,
the universe is still the universe?

597
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:51.740
What do you mean still the university?
It's like the world is the way they are.

598
00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:56.630
I mean the,
the way it is,
there's trees and grass and dirt and this person dies.

599
00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.290
The trees and grass and dirt.
They don't change.
They're still the same thing.

600
00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.580
What do you mean that the nature of the tree would change it?
No,

601
00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:09.440
I'm saying if you love someone and you know this person and they are no longer

602
00:34:09.441 --> 00:34:13.550
with us,
all the things around you like this coffee cup and this knife,

603
00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:16.910
they stayed,
remained the same.
They don't change.
No,
they don't change.

604
00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:20.630
Why would you assume that it would be any different for yourself if you weren't

605
00:34:20.631 --> 00:34:24.830
here?
Why would you think that this table would not exist for the microphone?

606
00:34:24.831 --> 00:34:27.620
Would not say that's a great argument.
I'm not thinking it wouldn't.

607
00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:31.130
That's this is what we call hard objectivity.
Something that's hard.

608
00:34:31.131 --> 00:34:35.540
Objectivity exist without any human mind in exist.
If all human minds were dead,

609
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:40.160
whatever exists still is what we would call philosophers called hard
objectivity.

610
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:43.220
Now we have objectivity,
so for instance,

611
00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:46.280
let's look at the George Berkeley's example is,
that's such a great question.

612
00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:51.500
Look at a triangle.
Okay.
Okay.
Picture a blue triangle.
Okay.
Picture a green.

613
00:34:51.501 --> 00:34:53.570
One picture of black,
one picture or white one.

614
00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:56.630
Can you picture one with no subjective elements?
Meaning.

615
00:34:56.631 --> 00:35:01.100
Because color is subjective,
right?
Color is a construct of the mind.

616
00:35:01.101 --> 00:35:02.420
So if I was colorblind,

617
00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:05.360
this shirt would be a different color to me than it is to you,
right?
However,

618
00:35:05.361 --> 00:35:09.380
they would still be one shirt.
It would be objective to a certain degree.
Okay,

619
00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:13.370
so triangle has three,
three sides,
three corners.

620
00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:17.690
It adds up to 180 degrees.
We all agree it.
Whether you're colorblind,

621
00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:18.770
it doesn't matter,
right?

622
00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:21.230
There's no subjective element to how many points does it have?

623
00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:26.060
Nobody's going to come in and say to me,
triangles have three,
four sites.
Right?

624
00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:29.860
You'd be like,
that's not a triangle.
There's not three angles to that,
right?

625
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:33.680
You've,
you've gone past it a little cool understanding.
Okay,

626
00:35:33.681 --> 00:35:36.530
so can you,
George Berkeley says,

627
00:35:36.531 --> 00:35:40.740
can you a triangle without any subjective elements,
without any color?

628
00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:43.650
Let's call it color.
To make it really simple,
really,
really obvious.

629
00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:46.620
Can you picture a triangle without any color?

630
00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:50.580
You would have to have it in contrast to something so that you could see it.

631
00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:55.170
Like if you had a say,
if you had a purple curtain,

632
00:35:55.230 --> 00:36:00.180
like what we have behind us and out of that Purple Carton we cut a triangle.

633
00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:05.670
Even if there was no color,
if it was just clear,
you would be able to see.

634
00:36:05.671 --> 00:36:07.830
You'd be able to differentiate between that shape,

635
00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:12.540
but she needed that purple curtain to differentiate so we cannot have it without

636
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:15.450
subjective element.
This was Berkeley's point.
Exactly what you said.

637
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:16.530
I see what you're saying.
Beautiful.

638
00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:21.060
Every objective thing we've observed in the universe has,

639
00:36:21.061 --> 00:36:22.830
this is made up of subjective elements.

640
00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:25.170
Even when you draw the number one on a blackboard,

641
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:28.980
it has to be a color asked to be something and it has to be a contrast.

642
00:36:28.981 --> 00:36:30.540
Like you said,
it's beautiful.
He said it beautifully.

643
00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:37.810
All our objective elements or mental constructs,
three sides.

644
00:36:37.811 --> 00:36:39.660
The idea of side is a mental construct.

645
00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:44.700
The idea of a point is a mental construct idea of 180 degrees is mathematical.

646
00:36:44.701 --> 00:36:48.220
It's happening in your mind somewhere,
right?
It's not out.
They're being observed.

647
00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:53.450
You can draw it and I can see it and I can repeat it and you can teach it to me

648
00:36:53.461 --> 00:36:57.390
and I can teach it to someone else.
Like these are,
they may be mental constructs,

649
00:36:57.670 --> 00:37:00.330
provable mental constructs that are repeatable.

650
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:02.610
So there we threw an agreement is a real thing.

651
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:06.960
We're in agreement that mathematics is a mental construct and it's true.

652
00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:11.270
It's definitely by the finish and true.
So both a mental construct and trust,

653
00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:14.790
but it's not outside out there in the world within.

654
00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:20.280
But if you make a triangle on the ground,
it's in the world.

655
00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.840
The numbers are in your head and the subjective element is in the world.

656
00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:30.450
There's a two way street.
The subjective element is in the world,

657
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:35.280
but it's a triangle.
So,
so how's it in your head?
Because you,

658
00:37:35.281 --> 00:37:39.900
when you look at a triangle,
the subjective elements,

659
00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:42.660
when you observe them in your mind,

660
00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:46.680
your mind points out different objective elements of that triangle.

661
00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:49.440
But it's dependent on your mind.
By that argument,

662
00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:52.770
the entire universe is dependent on your mind.
Absolutely.
No doubt about it.

663
00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:55.830
If we're going to use OCKHAM's razor,
yes,
but not everyday language.

664
00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:57.390
We use an outcomes.
Let's take away everything.

665
00:37:57.391 --> 00:38:00.120
We're not sure of everything that has a doubt.
Get rid of it.
Okay.

666
00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:02.330
Get rid of everything with a sliver of the league.

667
00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:05.850
Ever heard or the problem that they can't matter itself as a sliver of doubt?

668
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:06.900
Absolutely.
Well,

669
00:38:06.901 --> 00:38:11.370
when you have subatomic particles that you know they exist in two different

670
00:38:11.371 --> 00:38:16.020
states simultaneously.
They're both spinning and still there in superstates,

671
00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:19.260
Berkeley would tell you those are images of subatomic particles.

672
00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:23.400
They're not lump sum up t sub atomic particles independent of your mind.

673
00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:27.960
Well,
I had a conversation with Sean Carroll about it.

674
00:38:27.961 --> 00:38:32.370
It was a physicist and he made it familiar,
even more muddy to me.

675
00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:33.361
I thought,

676
00:38:33.361 --> 00:38:36.460
I thought it was crazy before I talked him and then when I talked to him,

677
00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:38.440
he's brilliant,
he's brilliant.

678
00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:43.620
He's essentially saying that subatomic particles don't blink in and out of

679
00:38:43.931 --> 00:38:46.390
existence.
It's just we,

680
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:51.990
it's the way we're looking at them and that they exist in this just bizarre

681
00:38:52.241 --> 00:38:53.074
state,

682
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:57.010
but they exist in this state in a way that it's very difficult for us to use

683
00:38:57.011 --> 00:39:00.220
normal language to sort of explain.
Exactly.
That's,
that's the issue.

684
00:39:00.221 --> 00:39:03.040
But you know what?
I might have fucked.
He's probably listening to them.

685
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:07.780
It's like you fucking dummy.
You know,
and what I said again,
you know what?

686
00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.790
What a great one.
Great conversation.

687
00:39:09.791 --> 00:39:13.120
I heard a conversation between Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris.
Oh,

688
00:39:13.121 --> 00:39:16.390
that the conversation about truth.
I loved it.
Although it drove me crazy.

689
00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:18.250
I think we could do better though.
Yes.

690
00:39:18.251 --> 00:39:21.640
I think they could have done better to moderator.
Yes,
exactly.
Exactly.

691
00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:24.250
Do you need to get to know each other personally first?

692
00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:27.970
They never met by the way.
That's it's,
that's fireworks,
right?

693
00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:31.840
That was such a great conversation.
But here's my question.

694
00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:35.590
What's the difference between knowledge and belief?

695
00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:38.320
Because a lot of what we said,
it's kind of muddy.
Okay,
let's make it suit.

696
00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:41.500
Let's make,
let's make the water's crystal clear as much as possible.
Okay.

697
00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:46.510
What is the difference between knowledge and belief?
Well,

698
00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:49.510
the belief that the gremlins are pulling down on people,

699
00:39:49.511 --> 00:39:53.440
which is why we have gravity.
That would be a belief.
No,
they're both beliefs.

700
00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:56.790
Well,
Dad,
gravity's not knowledge.
It's a belief.
Okay,

701
00:39:56.791 --> 00:40:00.730
but we're talking about Graham ones where I was going to say that's knowledge or

702
00:40:00.731 --> 00:40:05.230
that's,
that's a belief.
Belief,
knowledges.
If I throw water on your,
you get wet.

703
00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:09.040
Hmm.
I would say that's a belief to believe.
Yes.

704
00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.730
So maybe one day I throw water on you and Youtube,

705
00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:14.830
show me that you're cheeses and the water just goes right through you.

706
00:40:14.831 --> 00:40:15.461
And it does.

707
00:40:15.461 --> 00:40:18.790
The reason why you believe water will make me wet is because it happened in the

708
00:40:18.791 --> 00:40:21.700
past.
Now you think that the future is going to behave like the past.

709
00:40:21.701 --> 00:40:24.550
Just like Aristotle saw the sun go around the earth and he thought that this is

710
00:40:24.551 --> 00:40:26.820
going to happen every day.
He didn't understand.
I understand.

711
00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:29.710
It's optical illusion.
Let me get,
let me want to understand better is though.

712
00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:33.880
It's each to,
okay,
throw it out.
She get wet.
All flamingos are pink.
They're not.

713
00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:37.300
They're not.
We didn't know that all the time.
Did we?
Then we went to Australia.

714
00:40:37.301 --> 00:40:38.560
They don't have the same food source.

715
00:40:38.561 --> 00:40:40.720
They don't have the same food sorts of their black here.
They're white here.

716
00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.100
They have a different food source.

717
00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:47.250
Flamingos are not inherently pink as a scientific fact that can always be

718
00:40:47.351 --> 00:40:52.000
overturned.
This is,
he threw water and didn't get wet.
Yeah,

719
00:40:52.001 --> 00:40:56.560
but this is not just because it's a,
it's a certain coding.
Right.

720
00:40:56.740 --> 00:41:00.010
I got you.
But if he's got that over,
his body's not going to be able to breathe.

721
00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:03.160
Okay.
How about this?
You've never seen fire before.

722
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:05.770
You've never seen five K and you've been being,

723
00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:08.740
you've been being warmed by electric blanket your entire life.
Okay.

724
00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:11.050
Then you see a flame and you don't know.

725
00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:13.690
Can you know that that flame is going to burn you if you touch it logically or

726
00:41:13.691 --> 00:41:17.080
is it only via experience?
Through history,
developing a history,

727
00:41:17.081 --> 00:41:20.620
a relationship with fire.
A bird you once it burns you twice,
you're like,
hey,

728
00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:22.660
but I think the future is going to behave like the past.

729
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:27.820
Who Know that fire burns you and they've never been burned by fire because they

730
00:41:27.821 --> 00:41:32.440
went to school and they learn from people who explained the properties of fire,

731
00:41:32.441 --> 00:41:34.460
what it is,
how it works,

732
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:36.060
<v 1>what temperature it operates on,</v>

733
00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:39.070
how it's different depending upon the color of it or what's burning.

734
00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:43.390
Borrowed history,
borrowed history.
It's still history,
borrowed history.
How so?

735
00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:46.160
You learn from my mistakes of touching fire.
Okay,

736
00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:50.480
but it's still known VR experience for your history.
Well,

737
00:41:50.481 --> 00:41:51.800
it's known via science.

738
00:41:51.801 --> 00:41:56.510
If you explain exactly what the elements of the fire are and how it works and

739
00:41:56.511 --> 00:42:00.320
what it burns at and what temperature specific things need to burn out,

740
00:42:00.321 --> 00:42:04.550
you don't have to get burned to know that it will burn you.
No,
no,

741
00:42:04.551 --> 00:42:08.840
but that's how we discovered fire burns by testing it.
Not via logical deduction.

742
00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:10.760
Okay,
I see what you're saying.
It's only history.

743
00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:15.170
Science is pattern is irregularities found in nature.
We observe nature.

744
00:42:15.171 --> 00:42:17.420
We see these patterns and regularities.
Right?

745
00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:18.980
We have no idea what's causing them.

746
00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:24.250
Well wasn't that day cards original idea about science in the first place was

747
00:42:25.671 --> 00:42:30.671
using measurement to sort of understand nature well was then one of his original

748
00:42:32.241 --> 00:42:35.270
concepts of establishing science in the first place?
No,

749
00:42:35.271 --> 00:42:37.580
his original concept was they look,
science is doubtable.

750
00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.060
He said that science is doubtable L.
Dot.

751
00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:43.400
It's called Cartesian dealt extreme level of doubt.
He says,

752
00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:46.850
those are all beliefs.
I don't have any knowledge.
What do,
what do I know?

753
00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:49.880
Because knowledge means zero chance of being wrong.
Okay,

754
00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:53.060
zero chance of being wrong.
Give me one scientific fact.

755
00:42:53.061 --> 00:42:55.790
You truly trust 100% okay.

756
00:42:55.880 --> 00:43:00.880
If I take a match and I take a yellow piece of paper from this particular

757
00:43:02.271 --> 00:43:07.220
notebook,
I will light that motherfucker file with that match.
That's a fact.
Okay.

758
00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:10.940
That's sight of the fact is it?
And though it's a scientific fact,

759
00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:14.750
but it's not higher than hypothesis is just hypothesis you up.
Why?

760
00:43:14.751 --> 00:43:18.620
Because every time you've seen a fire touch of piece of paper,
it burned it.

761
00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:22.160
So you're relying on your historical experiences.

762
00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:26.420
You're essentially saying there's no scientific fact possible.

763
00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:29.010
Only to the level of hypothesis we can.

764
00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:31.700
This is not me talking and this is Thomas Quinn.
I shouldn't be saying,
look,

765
00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:36.800
he's saying,
look,
we have two phases in science,
standards,
science,

766
00:43:36.801 --> 00:43:39.530
and then a scientific revolution.
What Standard Science?
Well,

767
00:43:39.531 --> 00:43:44.330
whatever the flavor of the day is.
Let's say today it's,
let's hit the dates,

768
00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:46.760
evolution.
And then he said,
look,

769
00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:49.460
every every piece of information that we receive,

770
00:43:49.461 --> 00:43:51.680
we interpret it through that Lens.
He called it a paradigm.

771
00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:56.330
We look at the information through the lens of evolution,
so it makes sense.

772
00:43:56.331 --> 00:44:00.350
It fits right here in our story of evolution,
right?
And then he says,
look,

773
00:44:00.351 --> 00:44:04.910
a small amount of contradictory information is going to pool slowly.

774
00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:11.030
It's inevitable.
He says,
and then this,
we're gonna ignore it.

775
00:44:11.031 --> 00:44:12.800
We're going to sweep it under the rug.
Everything doesn't make sense.

776
00:44:12.801 --> 00:44:15.980
We're going to sweep it under the rug.
And then one day,

777
00:44:15.981 --> 00:44:18.150
that level of information that,
that,

778
00:44:18.151 --> 00:44:21.740
that amount of information that doesn't fit in any way with our theory or

779
00:44:21.741 --> 00:44:24.950
current theory is going to pull and pull and pull and pull until one guy comes

780
00:44:24.951 --> 00:44:27.350
around and says,
no,
we had a backwards or we had it wrong.

781
00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:30.740
It's this and now all this new information fits in the new theory.

782
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:34.490
All the old stuff fits and all the new stuff fits and that's called the

783
00:44:34.491 --> 00:44:35.540
scientific revolution.

784
00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:39.020
And he says science is always going through a normal phase and then a revolution

785
00:44:39.021 --> 00:44:43.310
phase and man is becoming more and more precise but will never reach the level

786
00:44:43.311 --> 00:44:44.960
of past hypothesis.
Why?

787
00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:50.160
Because science is based on our faith that their past,

788
00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:53.750
excuse me,
that the future will behave like the past.

789
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:59.090
We only know things via experience,
VR history.
So when I flipped that coin,

790
00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:02.720
you have no idea what's going to happen until I flipped many coins in front of

791
00:45:02.721 --> 00:45:05.600
you or I give you my ex.
If you trust me and I tell you what,
listen,

792
00:45:05.601 --> 00:45:07.610
I did this experiment,
here are my results and you trust me.

793
00:45:07.611 --> 00:45:10.010
You just take it for granted.
You,
you take it on.
We have authority.

794
00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:11.870
I agree with everything you said.

795
00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:15.850
<v 0>I still don't see where you're saying science has so much.
Whew.
Okay.</v>

796
00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:20.030
Or science has this much woo as healers or crystals,

797
00:45:20.031 --> 00:45:23.600
suckers or listen,
I don't believe Trump stills in any of that.
I know you don't.

798
00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:26.750
I don't.
I don't.
I don't.
I just,
I have a higher standard of skepticism.

799
00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:28.220
I'm missing the Wu though.
Okay.

800
00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:33.100
<v 1>The Wu is when we project physical laws,
combustion,</v>

801
00:45:33.101 --> 00:45:37.750
electricity,
gravity,
these are all appeal to magic.
Can you demonstrate these,

802
00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:41.510
these physical laws or are they byproducts?

803
00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:43.860
Are they,

804
00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:47.890
are they inferences you made in your mind because you've seen a certain pattern

805
00:45:47.891 --> 00:45:52.560
over and over again,
that law doesn't exist out there in the universe.

806
00:45:52.561 --> 00:45:55.530
It's only a bookmark.
It's only a name we have for a pattern.

807
00:45:55.531 --> 00:45:56.520
We've observed the nature.

808
00:45:58.450 --> 00:46:01.990
<v 0>It's pretty heavy stuff.
I know it's only a name for a pattern.</v>

809
00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:04.750
Exactly what we've observed that exists in nature.
Exactly.

810
00:46:04.751 --> 00:46:08.740
So that means you can't label anything ever because everything is just a pattern

811
00:46:08.741 --> 00:46:11.320
that we've observed in nature.
Everything is a pattern.
There is no,

812
00:46:11.321 --> 00:46:12.640
there's no logic behind that.

813
00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:16.770
<v 1>We give an explanation,
we give a narrative to it.
Okay,</v>

814
00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:20.260
but that narrative is just our paradigm.

815
00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:23.930
Commas cone would say that's the shades you're wearing.
Okay,
that's you.

816
00:46:23.931 --> 00:46:27.760
You can't set a beautiful,
he said,
look,
you have pink tinted glasses.

817
00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:31.540
You could have blue tinted glasses,
but whatever glasses you're wearing,

818
00:46:31.541 --> 00:46:33.670
that's the song and dance.
That's the,
that's the,

819
00:46:33.671 --> 00:46:36.460
that's the story you tell yourself of why those things are happening,

820
00:46:36.461 --> 00:46:39.550
the way they're happening.
Okay.
The truth of the matter is,

821
00:46:39.551 --> 00:46:42.550
all we're seeing is one pattern happening over and over again.

822
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:45.920
<v 0>So what this is essentially is an intellectual exercise,</v>

823
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:51.180
but the reality of our ability to come up,
whatnot,

824
00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:53.060
hours are obviously super smart.

825
00:46:53.061 --> 00:46:56.990
People come up with the very technology that we're using right now to broadcast

826
00:46:56.991 --> 00:47:01.340
this podcast.
It means that they have figured things out,

827
00:47:01.341 --> 00:47:06.341
that there are provable and that you can use science to determine what frequency

828
00:47:06.681 --> 00:47:09.830
things need to be,
how much electricity you need,

829
00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:12.520
what kind of components can you know,

830
00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:18.040
take the image and projected through the power lines and through the Internet

831
00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:22.700
cables and all the different things that we need to be in place to provide the

832
00:47:22.701 --> 00:47:26.300
electricity to provide the Internet connection.
That's all science.

833
00:47:26.301 --> 00:47:29.320
So this is all predictive sites is predictive,
right?
But this is all,

834
00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:33.640
these are all things that are not just observable,
but they're repeatable,
right?

835
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:37.150
The pattern.
Where's the woo?
Here's,
here's,
here's where the rule is.
Okay.

836
00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:42.770
Our explanation for why it happens,
the laws of nature are woo.

837
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:44.350
It's not woo.

838
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:49.060
It's are you our words that we use to describe repeatable things.

839
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:51.490
Okay.
Which,
which,

840
00:47:51.491 --> 00:47:55.480
which law of which force of of of nature are you referring to?

841
00:47:55.481 --> 00:47:57.640
Let's pick one at random.
Miss,
can you show?

842
00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:01.210
I don't think that is a force of nature.
Okay,
so with you,
that randomness.

843
00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:05.080
The idea of randomness.
Okay.
Pick one because they use it.
They say it's,

844
00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:10.320
it's evolution of a natural section via a random selection.

845
00:48:10.730 --> 00:48:15.730
Temperature.
Temperature.
Okay.
Okay.
What causes to observe temperature like you?

846
00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:19.780
I believe temperature exists.
What causes temperature?
We don't know.

847
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:25.590
That's true.
And we don't know.
We,
you and I don't know any science.

848
00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:28.120
They don't have any idea what causes only.

849
00:48:28.121 --> 00:48:30.490
Tell me about the pattern regularities.
That's it.

850
00:48:30.491 --> 00:48:35.290
That friction causes certain things that the magnetic pull of the sun on the

851
00:48:35.291 --> 00:48:37.960
earth causes certain temperature shifts and the,

852
00:48:37.961 --> 00:48:41.710
these are recognizable and repeatable and they understand how to measure them.

853
00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:46.150
These are all just patterns and regularities found in nature.
Right.

854
00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:48.550
And they're giving them names and explanations.

855
00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:52.030
I see what you're saying isn't explanations can be debunked later on.

856
00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:55.930
I put them in the maybe bio plausible pile,
but this is,
this is,
listen,

857
00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:59.350
I know it's frustrating,
but the philosophy of science,
this is it.

858
00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:03.100
The cause and effect.
We do not observe cause and effect.

859
00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:07.780
We do not observe one thing causing another.
We just see a and then we see B.

860
00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:10.900
It's really,
it's really,
it's a bit difficult,
but imagine this,

861
00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:12.850
we see and we see B,
we don't,

862
00:49:12.851 --> 00:49:15.940
we don't see the cause of connection because if we did see the causal
connection,

863
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:18.610
you would know what happens.
When I flipped that coin,

864
00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:19.540
you could have predicted it.

865
00:49:19.570 --> 00:49:21.670
You called predict what's going to happen when a file,

866
00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:26.170
exactly how much force you're exerting on your thumb.
To flip that coin,

867
00:49:26.171 --> 00:49:29.620
I would have to know what altitude we're at to understand what the atmosphere

868
00:49:29.621 --> 00:49:32.620
that this coin is going through.
I would have to know the weight of the coin.

869
00:49:32.621 --> 00:49:35.440
I would have to know that the position of your thumb on the thing,

870
00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:38.560
it's like what you said about the billiard balls,
that that is true,

871
00:49:38.561 --> 00:49:42.430
that if you could calculate the exact amount of friction on the cloth into
table,

872
00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:45.610
the amount of Polish that are on the balls,
the amount of force,

873
00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:49.180
you'd have to have all the balls in the exactly the same spot.

874
00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:53.710
But this is,
this is not possible today too.
Dang.

875
00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:57.310
If you set up a table and you set up,

876
00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:01.060
let's say just say nine balls and you told me you were going to know where every

877
00:50:01.061 --> 00:50:02.950
ball was to the millimeter,

878
00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:08.250
I would say I will bet you $1 million you're wrong and I would be right every

879
00:50:08.801 --> 00:50:11.170
time.
You're never going to get it.
Why?

880
00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:14.440
Because you don't have the ability to calculate all those very,

881
00:50:14.441 --> 00:50:17.260
but it's theoretically passion.
It's also the physical,

882
00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:21.400
the physical change of the amount of force that you drive when you break those

883
00:50:21.401 --> 00:50:26.080
balls varies and it varies even slightly.
It's going to change the way.

884
00:50:26.081 --> 00:50:31.070
So a person just doing it with their body is not capable of that kind of

885
00:50:31.071 --> 00:50:35.090
precision.
If we got a robot to break,
even if you've got a robot to break,

886
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:39.920
you would have to have those balls in exactly the same spot and they don't

887
00:50:39.921 --> 00:50:44.180
usually sit that way because the cloth has fiber in it and it's wool.

888
00:50:44.181 --> 00:50:49.181
It's a worsted wool and that worsted wool moves and shifts and bends and it

889
00:50:49.281 --> 00:50:53.240
flattens out in some spaces and other spaces.
It gets dirt and debris.

890
00:50:53.241 --> 00:50:54.980
In Charleston,
there's too many variables,

891
00:50:54.981 --> 00:50:57.800
so because we cannot compute all the variables,
I'm with you.
We can,

892
00:50:57.830 --> 00:51:02.140
maybe we can create a tool with a slight margin of error.
Right?
Well,

893
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:03.410
they'll still be a margin of error.

894
00:51:03.411 --> 00:51:06.120
That's why Laplas said I'd need a divine calculator.
Yeah.
He said,

895
00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:09.980
we don't have to even round off the numbers,
so I'll be slightly wrong.
Right.

896
00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:13.790
But the argument is that if we had all the variables and that's a big,

897
00:51:13.791 --> 00:51:15.680
if it's logically possible,

898
00:51:15.681 --> 00:51:20.190
it's logically coherent with the reality that we see.
Yes.
Random.

899
00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:23.300
This is by the wayside.
It's a figment of our imagination.

900
00:51:23.301 --> 00:51:27.260
We projected when we cannot compute,
but if we could,

901
00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:30.810
this is a objective outside of us,
right?

902
00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:34.640
The truth is outside of it's not dependent on me and you how we see the world.

903
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:38.840
So randomness is based essentially on our inability to calculate variables.

904
00:51:38.841 --> 00:51:43.780
It's not on an actual law itself.
Yes.
When we say that's random,
it's wool,

905
00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:47.930
right?
It is and the strictest way of the,
of the word.
Now,
every logical law.

906
00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:50.290
Now this,
this,
this is what hurts people,
but I love science.
Look at me.

907
00:51:50.291 --> 00:51:53.330
I'm Ramallah lover of Sinai and I'm a,
I'm a,
I'm a science addict.

908
00:51:53.350 --> 00:51:55.850
Can I read all the books?
I'm fascinated by science.

909
00:51:56.600 --> 00:52:01.070
Let's say I take object x and I throw it out that I throw out a window.

910
00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:04.040
What's going to happen?
I don't know.
You don't know?

911
00:52:04.041 --> 00:52:07.070
I haven't experienced with object,
object X.
I don't know what object is.

912
00:52:07.071 --> 00:52:09.530
Why can't you?
Why can't you produce it?
Why can't you do this?

913
00:52:09.531 --> 00:52:12.620
What's going to happen?
Well,
if I had more information than you need experience,

914
00:52:12.621 --> 00:52:17.510
you need a history with object x.
You need to get to know object x,
interact.

915
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:19.370
You cannot deduce it.

916
00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:23.420
While you would write down all these different variables,

917
00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:27.370
you would find out what people have learned from the past about these variables.

918
00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:29.540
Now we'd be science.
Exactly.

919
00:52:29.541 --> 00:52:34.010
Science is the history of patterns and regularities.
It is not.

920
00:52:34.070 --> 00:52:38.180
Deduction is not logic.
It's the type of lighter we call inductive logic.

921
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:42.800
This logic is the faith that the past,
that the future,

922
00:52:42.830 --> 00:52:44.270
soon in the future it will behave like the past.

923
00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:48.920
So the patterns and regularities we see in nature,
we say,
look,

924
00:52:48.921 --> 00:52:52.160
if these happen often enough,
we can recreate the circumstances.
Often enough,

925
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:54.200
we predict it will happen in the future.

926
00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:56.930
We have a faith that it'll happen again in the future.

927
00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:59.330
There is no logical reason why it does.

928
00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:03.260
There is no not one single logical reason.
While we don't fall off the fall off,

929
00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:04.850
fall off the face of the earth.

930
00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:08.570
Every explanation we give ourselves is just a narrative.

931
00:53:09.350 --> 00:53:12.290
It is always subject to interpretation.
However,

932
00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:17.090
with the change in variables like the shifting of the Earth's magnetic poles,

933
00:53:17.091 --> 00:53:21.710
or I gave you a ridiculous narrative and the Gremlin one just to show you,
look,

934
00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:24.070
I know you don't believe in mine.
I don't believe in my neither,
right,

935
00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:25.680
but I'm doing the same thing Isaac did

936
00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:31.470
<v 1>and I'm going to correlate my Grumman's three as far as he can correlate his</v>

937
00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:34.920
gravity theory.
He used the word gravity.
He made it.
He made it sound better.

938
00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:36.510
He made it sound less ridiculous,

939
00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:38.920
but the truth of matter is he's throwing his hands up in the air and saying,

940
00:53:38.921 --> 00:53:41.130
look,
I don't know.
Let's just call it gravity.
Let's,

941
00:53:41.131 --> 00:53:43.920
this is the way to think about it.
Now.
His contemporaries laughed at him.

942
00:53:43.921 --> 00:53:45.150
They said it's an appeal to magic.

943
00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:48.960
And then when people started wearing those shades,
those paradigms,
they're like,

944
00:53:48.961 --> 00:53:51.090
hey,
it makes sense if you,
if you believe,
if you,

945
00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:55.420
if you just believe in gravity for a second,
it explains all this ballet of,

946
00:53:55.421 --> 00:53:58.140
of celestial bodies and how they move.

947
00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:01.980
But really what he discovered was a pattern.
And he gave that pattern in name.

948
00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:06.090
But does that force exists out there?
Well,
not according to Einstein.

949
00:54:06.091 --> 00:54:09.310
He came up with a different narrative that fits the evidence even better than

950
00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:11.910
than Isaac Newton did.
But it's still a narrative.
It's,

951
00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:15.090
it hasn't removed all the other possibilities for something to be true.

952
00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:20.020
Without a doubt.
For it to be knowledge,
not belief.
There has to be zeroed out,

953
00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:23.540
meaning no other possibility whatsoever.
That's knowledge.
So my,

954
00:54:23.590 --> 00:54:27.240
so can you know something that's untrue?
You cannot know something that's untrue.

955
00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:29.580
You could believe something that's untrue.

956
00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:33.870
Knowledge means that this is known.
There is no possibility of doubt.

957
00:54:33.871 --> 00:54:37.080
That's what Descartes was such an important philosopher cause he gave us one

958
00:54:37.081 --> 00:54:40.590
thing that we know the cogito.
Have you heard of the Cognito?

959
00:54:41.370 --> 00:54:44.860
I don't remember what it is.
I think therefore I am.
Oh,
okay.

960
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:49.200
What is it that we know?
For sure.
Cause cause you know it's funny,

961
00:54:49.201 --> 00:54:51.780
there's two great philosophers that I've read that they went through a crisis in

962
00:54:51.781 --> 00:54:52.110
their life.

963
00:54:52.110 --> 00:54:55.200
One of them was amen because Ellia grid Arabic philosopher and one of them was

964
00:54:55.201 --> 00:54:59.190
Ernie.
They capped and both their writings are very like they're,
it's amazing.

965
00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:02.370
Why?
Because they go through this crisis.
They go through,
what do I actually know?

966
00:55:02.371 --> 00:55:05.790
What's not?
Because they came to this exact same conclusion that hey,

967
00:55:05.791 --> 00:55:09.330
it's all song and it's all us explanation.
It's not proof.

968
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:12.270
It's all a narrative.
It's all a point of view.

969
00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:16.170
Science keeps getting refined and changed.
What we more information,

970
00:55:16.171 --> 00:55:18.660
what we believed yesterday gets taken out from underneath us.

971
00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:22.620
Today's paradigms is going to be shifted again a hundred years from now,

972
00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:25.080
a thousand years from now.
What can I grab and be like,
this is true.

973
00:55:25.081 --> 00:55:28.320
Nobody can ever take this from me.
That's going to be called knowledge.

974
00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:30.360
So it all comes down like at the end,

975
00:55:30.361 --> 00:55:33.360
at the end of the long journey of Cartesian doubt.
They was,

976
00:55:33.361 --> 00:55:36.420
it was so extreme that the philosophers give it a new name.

977
00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:38.550
They call it Cartesian dot.
They call a modern philosophy.

978
00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:42.720
So philosophy is thousands of years old.
Descartes comes,
writes a book.

979
00:55:42.721 --> 00:55:47.160
He wrote six chapters in six days and he was like,
what do I actually know?

980
00:55:47.161 --> 00:55:51.210
100% without a doubt,
nobody can ever question me.
And he said,
look,

981
00:55:51.211 --> 00:55:53.850
I believe in the Cognito.
What's the Kogi too?
I think therefore I am.

982
00:55:54.570 --> 00:55:57.160
So he goes through a long process.
You know,
if we have the time,
we'll,

983
00:55:57.161 --> 00:56:01.230
we'll go through a little nutshell of it says,
look,
this is,
look,
when I,

984
00:56:01.231 --> 00:56:05.460
when I put a straw in a glass of water,
my eyes tell me that the straw is bent,

985
00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:10.080
right?
Because the reflection of the waters is,
is bent the light,

986
00:56:10.110 --> 00:56:14.460
the reflection of the light off the water.
He says,
look,
my eyes light to me.

987
00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:17.910
Aristotle thought the sun goes around the earth,
his eyes light to him,

988
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:21.690
our senses lie.
And he talks about if I put my hand in cold water,

989
00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:26.710
then I put it in tepid.
They'll seem warm to me.
But that's just my bias,

990
00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:30.350
my inability to tell you what my,
my,

991
00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:35.230
my instruments are not accurate enough.
So he said,
okay,

992
00:56:35.231 --> 00:56:36.710
let's,
let's put the

993
00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:42.280
empiricism or senses by the wayside cannot give us truth.

994
00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:46.270
Can I give us truth?
He says,
what about deduction?
What about math?

995
00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:50.290
And the local knowledge,
one plus one equals two.
Believe it or not,

996
00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:54.610
philosophers also disagree with a lot of mathematical,
uh,
beliefs.

997
00:56:54.730 --> 00:56:57.210
So for instance,
here's a,
here's a big critique of math.
Okay,

998
00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:00.340
one plus one equals two.
We all believe it,

999
00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:05.800
but the critique is that one plus one is another way of saying too,

1000
00:57:06.010 --> 00:57:08.020
there's no actual information you ever gave me.

1001
00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:13.540
Mathematics is just one way to sum up a lot of information.

1002
00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:16.570
It helps me give you an epiphany.
It makes,
it makes me,

1003
00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:19.480
it helps me make you understand what's happening on the billiard ball table.

1004
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:22.510
We'll give you a calling,
one plus one.
Two.

1005
00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:25.430
You're not changing the objects themselves in.

1006
00:57:25.450 --> 00:57:29.920
It's always been two things always been too.
Yeah,
it's a tautology.

1007
00:57:29.921 --> 00:57:33.220
You're just explaining to me something that's out there already existing.

1008
00:57:33.790 --> 00:57:36.880
So if I tell you a triangle has three points,
why when it said the word triangle,

1009
00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:40.030
I already told you how three points,
but maybe you didn't pick that up.

1010
00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:44.470
Maybe you had to point it out to you.
So Bertrand Russell said,
beautifully said,

1011
00:57:44.471 --> 00:57:49.060
look,
I've firsts in his career.
Burton Russel is a very,
he's a great thinker.

1012
00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:51.580
He said,
look,
mathematics is the thing we're more sure of.

1013
00:57:51.790 --> 00:57:55.300
By the end of his career.
He was like,
guys,
I'm not even sure about math anymore.

1014
00:57:55.330 --> 00:57:56.163
Why?
He's like,

1015
00:57:56.200 --> 00:58:00.190
I think math is just another way of saying a four legged animal has is an
animal.

1016
00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:04.420
But you said that when you said it's four legged animal and he just repeated

1017
00:58:04.421 --> 00:58:08.110
yourself by saying it's an animal.
If I say there's my wife,

1018
00:58:08.111 --> 00:58:11.290
I married her when I said my wife,
I told you I married her.

1019
00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:12.250
That's what math is doing.

1020
00:58:12.550 --> 00:58:16.240
Math is giving you the information again in a simpler form that you can

1021
00:58:16.241 --> 00:58:18.490
understand and you think,
oh,
I've deduced this instrument.
No,

1022
00:58:18.491 --> 00:58:23.110
actually the information was there in the question,
right?
Some,

1023
00:58:23.170 --> 00:58:25.960
some philosophers disagreed with this.
They said,
no,
math brings you like can't,

1024
00:58:25.961 --> 00:58:29.460
can't said no.
Math tells you something.
Okay,
let's put that on the wayside.

1025
00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:34.390
Here's another critique.
One I personally could never get around is they look,

1026
00:58:34.391 --> 00:58:36.880
he says,
look,
all of the greatest thinkers in history,

1027
00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:39.760
there's actually an urban Timia critique of,
of a logic.
He says,
look,

1028
00:58:39.761 --> 00:58:43.360
all the greatest thinkers in history all disagree like Plato and Aristotle.

1029
00:58:43.450 --> 00:58:45.160
You know,
Plato Tutored Aristotle,

1030
00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:48.790
two of the greatest thinkers in ancient history.

1031
00:58:49.450 --> 00:58:51.870
They don't agree with one another.
They do.

1032
00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:54.730
They both think they both say you're wrong.
And then I said,
I'm wrong.
Okay.

1033
00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:59.140
Fast forward.
Every generation,
their greatest thinkers disagreed.

1034
00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:01.990
Lightness didn't agree with Voltaire Today,

1035
00:59:01.991 --> 00:59:06.100
Sam Harris and and Jordan Peterson to,
okay,
maybe they're not the top,

1036
00:59:06.101 --> 00:59:08.500
top intellectuals of our world,
of our on earth today,

1037
00:59:08.501 --> 00:59:12.910
but there are there among the,
among the elite.
They don't agree on what is true.

1038
00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:15.760
When you ask them what's truth.
You guys are talking about truth all day long.

1039
00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:18.040
Can you define it for us?
We don't agree.

1040
00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:23.030
So if logic is something tells us about the world.
If it is,

1041
00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:27.350
let's say we grant that they caught saying,
look,
we can't use it.
We don't,

1042
00:59:27.351 --> 00:59:31.250
we're nobody's good enough to use it and get to a conclusion that everybody

1043
00:59:31.251 --> 00:59:34.550
agrees upon.
So he's saying,
look,
even that doesn't help me.

1044
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:38.780
So he came up to the Cogito,
he says,
look,

1045
00:59:40.070 --> 00:59:42.680
he doubted everything.
Like he even went to the point where he said,

1046
00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:47.570
what if I'm dreaming?
What if there's a evil demon are,

1047
00:59:47.571 --> 00:59:48.321
they're always tricky.
My,

1048
00:59:48.321 --> 00:59:51.760
he went really out there like that's one of the reasons why simulation theory

1049
00:59:51.761 --> 00:59:52.670
theories to yeah,

1050
00:59:53.170 --> 00:59:58.170
people really do what series people consider the potential that not only is it

1051
00:59:59.541 --> 01:00:02.390
possible that we are in a simulation,
but that there are many,

1052
01:00:02.391 --> 01:00:07.040
many simulations inside of simulations because we couldn't,

1053
01:00:07.041 --> 01:00:10.730
that's the egocentric predicament we were talking about earlier is you can not

1054
01:00:10.731 --> 01:00:12.650
experience anything outside of your consciousness.

1055
01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:16.400
So you could be plugged into a machine right now and this is just a big old

1056
01:00:16.401 --> 01:00:18.370
dream could be,
and that's why they cart.

1057
01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:22.520
The wanted to know what would be true even if I was in a simulator and that's I

1058
01:00:22.521 --> 01:00:25.100
think therefore I therefore am because for me to have thoughts,

1059
01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:26.450
I'd have to exist.

1060
01:00:27.050 --> 01:00:30.560
If you doubt the Kogi till you've proved the Cognito guest to object to it,

1061
01:00:30.561 --> 01:00:34.940
you first have to have existence.
Bryan,
right?
He refined it,
I think.

1062
01:00:34.941 --> 01:00:38.240
I think thinkers refined it later on and before him also many thinkers came to

1063
01:00:38.241 --> 01:00:40.670
this conclusion.
He just did it really famously.
He did it.

1064
01:00:40.671 --> 01:00:44.750
We did it in one sentence too.
He did it in one sentence.
He summed it up.

1065
01:00:45.290 --> 01:00:47.930
That's why if you,
you know,
I've heard of Ockham's razor.

1066
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:51.010
If you use OCKHAM's razor to an extreme,
if you go create,

1067
01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:53.510
if you go to an extreme degree,

1068
01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:56.600
if you everything with adult,
you chop it,

1069
01:00:57.590 --> 01:01:02.540
everything that might be imaginary,
inferred,
logical,

1070
01:01:02.541 --> 01:01:06.740
empirical,
you chop it.
What happens?
You have a transcendent experience.

1071
01:01:06.741 --> 01:01:09.310
You'd become you.
If you take off all your paradigms.

1072
01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:12.110
And this takes a very brave human being to do,

1073
01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:16.610
to remove everything that anybody's ever told you and have the experience of the

1074
01:01:16.611 --> 01:01:20.630
one thing,
what you would know,
what you would come to with mystics.

1075
01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:21.920
That's why I believe that there's,

1076
01:01:21.921 --> 01:01:26.390
there's a place where you can get where religion is true and science is faith.

1077
01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:29.750
And I know it sounds crazy,
but there is a point and I believe in science,

1078
01:01:29.751 --> 01:01:32.450
don't get me wrong,
I'm a,
I can't precise science enough,

1079
01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:35.450
but there is a transcendent experience a human has.

1080
01:01:35.451 --> 01:01:39.380
And that transcend experience is consciousness itself,

1081
01:01:39.381 --> 01:01:42.110
not the content of consciousness.
This is where people make a mistake.

1082
01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:47.450
Consciousness itself,
reality.
Your world is nested in consciousness.

1083
01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:51.350
People think consciousness is within my brain.
It's the opposite.
Your brain,

1084
01:01:51.351 --> 01:01:54.770
your body,
your uh,
your,
your self is in consciousness.
And when we,

1085
01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:57.300
when we get to this point,
then all our paradox is disappear.

1086
01:01:57.301 --> 01:02:00.620
There's no more paradox.
The logical paradox is maybe if we have time,

1087
01:02:00.621 --> 01:02:03.690
we talked about logical paradoxes,
they never end.
But when we,

1088
01:02:03.691 --> 01:02:06.980
we understand that our world is nested in consciousness.

1089
01:02:07.070 --> 01:02:09.770
There's nothing happening in the world around you that's outside of your

1090
01:02:09.771 --> 01:02:12.260
consciousness.
It's only outside of your eagle.

1091
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:14.870
The thing you would you associate with Joe Rogan

1092
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:21.060
is also happening inside your consciousness.
Your brain is within consciousness.

1093
01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:24.120
No Brene has ever been observed outside of consciousness.

1094
01:02:24.650 --> 01:02:27.600
See and flow in materialism.
We have this,

1095
01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:32.660
they have this philosophy called Epi for nominalism that the consciousness is a

1096
01:02:33.001 --> 01:02:34.620
byproduct of this physical brain.

1097
01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:41.120
We have this physical brain and your consciousness is like a byproducts,

1098
01:02:41.521 --> 01:02:45.990
like a smoke.
Now we asked them,
how do you know about this physical brain?

1099
01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:51.330
All we know it because of our consciousness.
If your consciousness is fake,

1100
01:02:51.331 --> 01:02:53.800
unreal,
then souls,
your brain,
your brain's,

1101
01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:57.180
the reason why we all know about brains is because of conscious consciousness

1102
01:02:57.181 --> 01:03:01.050
tells us about brains.
So brains are dependent on consciousness,

1103
01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:03.330
not consciousness dependent on the brain.

1104
01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:05.610
So I know this is a bit of a tricky thing,

1105
01:03:05.611 --> 01:03:07.260
but this is what idealism is all about.

1106
01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:12.900
There is no physical object outside of consciousness.

1107
01:03:12.901 --> 01:03:16.230
It's all mental construct.
This is d,
this is what we,
this is,

1108
01:03:16.450 --> 01:03:20.140
<v 0>we started this podcast talking about it and then,
and we ended on our mind.</v>

1109
01:03:20.141 --> 01:03:24.130
Fuck yeah,
seriously.
This is a serious mind.
Fuck the egocentric predicament.

1110
01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:27.610
Not In a,
not an easy one.
Well it's a,
it's,

1111
01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:32.770
it's a fascinating yet impractical exercise because you will,

1112
01:03:32.771 --> 01:03:34.250
you will do it to the end of time.

1113
01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:39.600
It'd be sitting here debating and discussing and dissecting the very,

1114
01:03:39.611 --> 01:03:40.181
but you know,

1115
01:03:40.181 --> 01:03:43.180
that's also how you gain a greater and deeper understanding of all the things

1116
01:03:43.181 --> 01:03:44.650
you have no idea what the fuck they are.

1117
01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:48.220
<v 1>Exactly.
But it's,
it's still,</v>

1118
01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:50.590
it's still amazing to me.

1119
01:03:50.591 --> 01:03:55.591
Like how much is to be explored about what is real around this,

1120
01:03:57.391 --> 01:04:01.930
like the world,
the reality of the world around us is it's,
it's,

1121
01:04:01.950 --> 01:04:04.320
it's greater than any mystery and an existence.
That's why for me,

1122
01:04:04.321 --> 01:04:07.820
I can't read fiction.
I only study science,
history,
philosophy.

1123
01:04:07.821 --> 01:04:10.130
That's the only thing.
Science,
history,
philosophy,
religion.

1124
01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:13.470
Cause it's weird enough.
No,
because it,

1125
01:04:13.610 --> 01:04:18.410
they're all trying to tell me they all trying to explain the world around us and

1126
01:04:18.411 --> 01:04:21.650
it's such a hard thing to do.
To sum up what's,
what's reality.
Hey,

1127
01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:23.990
all these philosophies and theories are trying to sum it up.

1128
01:04:24.170 --> 01:04:27.020
This is reality and to cross examine them.
For me,

1129
01:04:27.021 --> 01:04:28.250
it's far more entertaining than watching them

1130
01:04:28.270 --> 01:04:32.380
<v 0>movie or hearing a fictional story.
Hmm.
Yeah.
No,
I get it.</v>

1131
01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:36.010
I mean it's definitely fascinating and entertaining and a,

1132
01:04:36.090 --> 01:04:38.680
I liked fictional stories too though.
I like,

1133
01:04:38.681 --> 01:04:43.300
I like observing creativity because I'm fascinated by the human experience and

1134
01:04:43.301 --> 01:04:48.301
I'm fascinating by what people were able to create out of their own mind.

1135
01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:53.500
Something like we were talking yesterday about Stephen King about how amazing it

1136
01:04:53.501 --> 01:04:58.501
is that this guy just keeps continuing to create these bizarre stories and that

1137
01:04:58.901 --> 01:04:59.711
someone can do that.

1138
01:04:59.711 --> 01:05:04.711
The your consciousness and by putting so much emphasis on creativity and your

1139
01:05:05.081 --> 01:05:10.081
ability to just write down things that never really happened and paint a picture

1140
01:05:10.241 --> 01:05:11.350
inside someone's mind.

1141
01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:15.130
<v 1>Yeah.
Let me ask you this.
If he is,
if determinism is true,</v>

1142
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.260
who wrote the stories like when your retic has passed,
when you read it,

1143
01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:25.240
when you write a story on a computer,
did the computer write the story?
No.

1144
01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:28.240
You wrote a story.
Right?
But if determinism is true,

1145
01:05:28.241 --> 01:05:32.650
Stephen is just the computer and his buttons are being pushed by it.
Past events.

1146
01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:35.920
Yeah.
So that's why like one student asked me,
hey,

1147
01:05:35.921 --> 01:05:38.350
you should read a book by Sam Harris on determinism.
Like,
well,

1148
01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:39.700
can you ask Sam who wrote the book?

1149
01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:42.490
You know who wrote the book and the terrorism is going to say,
well,
he did.

1150
01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:44.650
Now he can write anything.
He's determined.

1151
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:48.730
These are old philosophical questions that need to be explored,
but they are,

1152
01:05:48.731 --> 01:05:52.930
like you say,
a mind bending,
you know,
very mind bending for us.

1153
01:05:52.931 --> 01:05:53.980
I'm glad we finally get this right.
