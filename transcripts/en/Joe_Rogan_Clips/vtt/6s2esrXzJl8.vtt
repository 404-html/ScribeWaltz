1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.500
Oh look at the trade,
right?

2
00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:05.330
Trump is making a big deal about the trade deficits and he's launching,

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.150
terrorist is going to have this trade war that he's convinced that we could win.

4
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.670
And this is very misguided.

5
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.330
The trade deficits are not the problem.

6
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.200
They are the consequence of the problem.

7
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.280
The problem is that we have bad monetary policy,

8
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.930
bad fiscal policy,
too much regulation.
That's why we have a trade deficit,

9
00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:32.340
because American industry is not productive enough.
We don't save enough.

10
00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:34.620
We don't make the right capital investment.

11
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.150
That's because interest rates have been kept too low.
You know,
our tax code,
uh,

12
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.560
favors debt,
you know,

13
00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:45.561
and we have a lot of regulations that make American businesses less competitive.

14
00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:49.770
And so the result is that we import a lot of products rather than making them

15
00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:50.281
ourselves.

16
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:54.720
And it's not because the other countries aren't fair or because they have

17
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:57.870
terrorists.
Terrorists are very low around the world.
I mean,

18
00:00:57.871 --> 00:00:59.670
there's tariffs are not the problem.

19
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.730
And so if Trump is simply going to erect tariffs,

20
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.540
all that's going to do is tax the American public because the American public

21
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:09.870
has to pay the tariffs whenever they buy imported products.

22
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.500
So this is not going to,
I'm going to turn the economy around.
But you know,

23
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.830
and Trump is right.
He points out that,
well,
you know,

24
00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:20.250
at one point in time America ran on terrorists,

25
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.110
which is true during the 19th century,
the government,
you know,

26
00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:29.100
raise money pro permanently by terrorists.
But we didn't have an income tax,

27
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.500
you know.
And so this is the irony of it.

28
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.530
The reason we have an income tax today is because the populous politicians of

29
00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:39.390
the day told the American voter,

30
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.050
if we can tax the rich with an income tax,

31
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.220
then we can get rid of terrorists that the average person is paying.

32
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.790
So the average person understood that terrorist costs them money.

33
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.590
And the politicians said,

34
00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:55.560
let's get rid of these tariffs and let's just tax the rich.

35
00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.030
And the income tax that was originally proposed really was a tax on the very

36
00:02:00.031 --> 00:02:02.910
rich.
I mean,
even doctors and lawyers didn't pay it.
I mean,

37
00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:06.790
you had to be super rich before you pay the tax.
And then it was like,
you know,

38
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.760
1% to 4%.
So it was a small tax and it,
and it wasn't taken from your paycheck,

39
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.010
right?
I mean,
first of all,
if you,
if you,
if you got a paycheck,

40
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.030
he didn't pay the tax,

41
00:02:15.031 --> 00:02:18.950
but we didn't have withholding until 1943 that was part of the,

42
00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:21.210
the victory tax to pay for the Second World War.

43
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.570
But Americans were told let's tax the rich and you won't have to,

44
00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:28.680
uh,
pay tariffs anymore.
Well,

45
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.950
the minute that the government got the nose under the tent,
right,

46
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.830
all of a sudden now the income tax affects everybody,
right?

47
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.760
People pay a lot more in income taxes today than they used to pay in terrorists.

48
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.050
But now,

49
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.730
now the president wants to bring the terrorists back on top of the income tax.

50
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:45.211
I mean,

51
00:02:45.211 --> 00:02:49.410
if Trump wants to repeal the income tax and get rid of it entirely and then have

52
00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:51.120
some terrorists,
I'd be okay with that.

53
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.230
But you can't do that unless you dramatically shrink the size of government,

54
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.080
which is the most important thing that Trump needs to do.

55
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.590
But what he's not doing,
he has to make the military smaller,
not bigger.
I mean,

56
00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:04.450
he's talking about a space for us.
I mean,

57
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:07.300
we can't even afford the air force navy marines that we got now.

58
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.960
We be around moving money for space force,
but we have to cut everything.

59
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:12.760
We got to cut entitlements,
right?

60
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:14.980
He's thing we should be the first people to have a space for us.

61
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.660
What are the Russians come up with a space for us?

62
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.720
No one's going to come up out of luck.
What does that even,
what did he do?

63
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:21.850
His space for us when we who we can fight in space.

64
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.110
Maybe we fight the Russians as bay.
Well,
why would we fight them in space?

65
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:29.350
Their doubt on earth.
Well,
maybe they want to fight in space.
It's more novel.

66
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.240
Yeah.
I don't think,
I don't think anybody wants to fight right now.

67
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.640
It'd be protected.
Right?
Yeah.
I,
I think we got that covered.

68
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.920
I think we've got a pretty good size military.

69
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.330
I don't think anyone's going to mess with us.
The problem is our economy,
so.
