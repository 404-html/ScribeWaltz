1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.340
That's what I was saying.
Anybody who tries to get away with a crime for example,

2
00:00:02.341 --> 00:00:05.550
like this Guy Jesse,
small light or whatever,
uh,
how,

3
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.800
this is what I had are no staff from day one,
Bro fucking call it.

4
00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:13.650
People coming to me and me and Jamie,
we shut the cameras.

5
00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:15.990
Are we like is everything done by in this shit?

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.380

7
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.580
Clad people texted me,

8
00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:24.410
this is bullshit because you know it just sounded cal and I was like

9
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.130
yeah some people were saying online that it was like,

10
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.050
like what happens when you let actors write a script,
right,
right.

11
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.480
Bridget even worse,
getting an actor to try to get away with a crime.

12
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.670
There are cops,
Chicago cops,

13
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.630
cause they haven't seen everything cause they don't cause those guys don't study

14
00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:48.180
crime and you're new to the game and you come and you're going to pull the wool

15
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:51.970
over the Chicago police.
All those detectives.
And it's like me,

16
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.630
I started fighting a little,
I saw some stuff on youtube.

17
00:00:54.631 --> 00:00:58.290
I'm going to go and fight.
And how about,
how about,
how about the Brian,

18
00:00:58.291 --> 00:01:02.700
his boys and they squealed real fast,
quick huggle don't need to finish it.

19
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:06.750
Fuck's going on in your phones.
I left those guys loose.
They're like,

20
00:01:06.751 --> 00:01:10.770

21
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.690
Johanna actually sculpted the right trainer.

22
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.500
Hector lumbar.
