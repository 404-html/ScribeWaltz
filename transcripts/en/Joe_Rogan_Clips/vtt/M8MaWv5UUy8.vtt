1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:01.350
Ain't know.
They know.
You know,

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:05.460
I've been reading these articles written by these angry women about Louis C.

3
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.150
Case comeback and some of them have been going to his shows and writing about

4
00:00:10.151 --> 00:00:13.980
his show.
And one of them that I read today was from this woman in Pittsburgh.

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.890
What I thought was fascinating,
she said that he has a,

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.570
he doesn't allow people to bring cell phones,
you know,

7
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:26.040
they have those yonder pouches.
We put your,
and the woman's her,

8
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.530
her rationalization of this was,

9
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.740
and she included me and Dave Chappelle and this,

10
00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:35.520
that we use those because we know that words offend,

11
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.460
but we don't want the consequences,
which is not what it is at all.
No,
it's,

12
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.160
you don't want people sharing your,

13
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.840
if your material online because you're developing it and you're touring with it.

14
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.750
Just like we,
we and jokes are a surprise position.

15
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:50.370
Doesn't want you recording them,

16
00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:55.320
just noodling around before they finish this song.
Right.
But it musician's song,

17
00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:56.220
the differences,

18
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.730
you can hear it over and over and over again and it doesn't lose any of the

19
00:00:59.731 --> 00:01:04.020
thing.
You to joy it more,
more to the point.
But if you have a bit about diapers,

20
00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:04.261
right.

21
00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:07.860
And there's just like a very specific punchline about a diaper and then they

22
00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:08.580
already know it.

23
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.210
They know that punchline and you're working out how to get to that punchline and

24
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:16.260
how to set up the bit.
But someone leaked the audio already like that.

25
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.640
Like Louise touring right now with that leaked set.
Yeah.

26
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.560
Which is weird,
right?

27
00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:26.100
Like what all that stuff about the Parkland kids and I don't know if he's still

28
00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:28.590
doing those bits,
but he was doing some of those bits.
Yeah.

29
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.190
Like he has a bit about losing all the money and about,
uh,

30
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.260
how he bought a gold watch.
Like those bits,

31
00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:36.750
like this woman referenced those bits in the article,

32
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.320
which means that she went to the show and he's doing the material from the leak,

33
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.470
which kind of has to do because he's only if you brought an hour over the last

34
00:01:45.901 --> 00:01:49.770
10 months.
Right.
He's been hiatus.
What,
what does he do?

35
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.940
Like what he can't,
he's touring.
So is he going to tour with a whole new hour?

36
00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:58.050
Get the fuck Outta here?
Yeah.
I mean,
I feel like,
I feel like he's,

37
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.870
he's quite obviously a special case because of his behavior.
Yeah.

38
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.110
But it's,
it's almost like,
I will say that aside,
you know,
like,

39
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.370
uh,
I have my problems with Louie and what he's done and everything,

40
00:02:11.371 --> 00:02:16.371
but overall I'm on the side of free speech and in terms of being comedians,

41
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:17.630
I,
we,

42
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.140
we can't allow you to come in and film our shit or recorded no matter who it is,

43
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.070
because it's,
it's the,
the larger thing is like everyone,

44
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.010
one thing with comedy is everyone,
everyone,
everyone thinks they're an expert.

45
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.220
There's no other art form or someone's like,
I know what the best shit is,

46
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.730
or I've got a friend funnier than you.
Right.
You know,
in all fairness,

47
00:02:35.731 --> 00:02:37.710
if I go to see a movie,
I'm not a movie maker,

48
00:02:37.711 --> 00:02:40.770
but if I go to see a movie and I think it sucks,
I should be able to say,
oh,

49
00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:42.270
that movie blue.
True.

50
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.630
But you're not allowed to go on set and film at yourself while they're filming,

51
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.890
while you're also not allowed to bootleg it and then put it online.

52
00:02:49.891 --> 00:02:54.330
You go to jail.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it really will.
And people,
uh,
that,

53
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.170
that record our stuff like uh,
Stan hope was,
was tweeting about that.

54
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.110
Like how is this legal right after the and Louis thing.
Yeah.
And,
and uh,
you know,

55
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.750
Chappelle has that thing that like the comedy works has,

56
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:07.350
where you come in with your cell phone,
they put it in a locked pouch.

57
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.250
You get the Combo you're getting when you leave.

58
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.170
I was doing that before I did my Netflix special as far was only doing it to

59
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.030
really,
because I was tightening up my,

60
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.870
my set and I didn't want any of it getting leaked right before the Netflix

61
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:23.740
special.
But once I filmed it,
then I stopped doing it because it was like,

62
00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:24.640
it's too hard,

63
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.780
too complicated and it's just like the Internet is going to be the internet.

64
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.950
It's just,
it did make the show better though.
You know,

65
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:36.040
where it did make it better.
Miami,
I'll realize in Miami,

66
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.220
people are there such chimps that they just kept getting up and walking out and

67
00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:45.130
to check their phone.
They'd get up,
they'd go out to get their phone,

68
00:03:45.131 --> 00:03:48.010
they come back,
and so they were all just like popping up and down.

69
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.130
Everybody's just trying to fucking do coke in Miami.
Argued.
