1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.870
I Dunno,
I,
I had,
uh,
I had,

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.150
I went to this facility in,
in San Diego is called,
um,
Dang,

3
00:00:09.151 --> 00:00:11.730
why can't I remember,
oh,
a mindset.

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.000
And actually the UFC sent me there because I mean we have,
you saw though,

5
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:18.570
we have all of these things like,
um,
after fighting Amanda,

6
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.920
I got my head pounded for a good four minutes there.
Um,

7
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.810
I had a Tbi afterwards,
so that was like,
uh,

8
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.580
immediately lowered my estrogen,
lowered my da Da,

9
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.030
my testosterone and I'm hypo thyroid.

10
00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:37.730
Like I will always be hyperthyroid now like I have.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And um,
you know,

11
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:38.670
still toughed it out.

12
00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:42.450
So it was trying to do what I could to go and fight Ronda as soon as I did

13
00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:43.580
afterwards.
And you know,

14
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.160
part of my game plan is don't get hit and which means like,

15
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.440
let's just dart outer and see what happens is,
you know,
so what,

16
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.110
that's what happens when you do that.

17
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.760
<v 1>No,
Tbi is traumatic brain injury just in case there's someone who's listening to</v>

18
00:00:56.761 --> 00:00:59.790
this doesn't emerge down what we're talking about.
And then in the Rhonda fight,

19
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:00.870
if people don't know about that,

20
00:01:00.871 --> 00:01:03.600
you just charged after and he got caught in an arm bar and like,
what was it?

21
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:04.630
Very quick

22
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.460
<v 0>14,
it was 14 things,
but I did hit her with a knee.
I did throw her ass,</v>

23
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.820
but she practiced a little Ninja move and comedy alarm and it was,

24
00:01:15.011 --> 00:01:19.430
it was over,
you know.
But I mean even,
even her coaches were like,
I mean that's,

25
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.040
you did what you're supposed to do there.
And She just got you.
You know,
so,
um,

26
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.900
that would be an awesome fight to be able to revisit one day.

27
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.890
She even said we'd do it.
I mean,
who knows her career so open right now.

28
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.680
She will need to really doesn't need it.

29
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.720
<v 1>I don't think she wants to.
I think,</v>

30
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.040
I mean,
who knows,
you'd have to ask her,

31
00:01:40.041 --> 00:01:42.500
but there's a lot of lessons to be learned.

32
00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:47.501
And what happened to her in terms of like all of the distractions and Hollywood

33
00:01:47.781 --> 00:01:52.550
came calling and there were scripts and talk about doing road house and there

34
00:01:52.551 --> 00:01:54.860
was all this,
all this shit going on.

35
00:01:54.861 --> 00:01:59.450
There was other than fighting and then it was also,
look,

36
00:01:59.451 --> 00:02:03.830
the sport has evolved so rapidly in the women's,

37
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.350
women's MMA has gotten so high level so quickly and if he's,

38
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.410
I'm sure you saw a man does last fight with Raquel Pennington.
I'm like,

39
00:02:12.411 --> 00:02:13.370
Holy Shit.

40
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.790
I mean that was a fucking high level performance from her and five rounds,

41
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.560
super high cardio,
just put a beating down.
And Raquel Pennington,

42
00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:27.230
he's one of the toughest girls in the world for sure.

43
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.530
<v 0>Right?
I do like,
I mean I'm curious,</v>

44
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.440
I was saying the same thing as the fights going.
Right.
And then I have,
uh,

45
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.380
some people in my ear next to me,
they're like,

46
00:02:35.381 --> 00:02:36.940
well how long has it been since we're cal?
Fuck,

47
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.800
cause she didn't look her for like beefiest right.
She,
she looked a little tired.

48
00:02:41.801 --> 00:02:46.801
She looked a little like not her typical and then it's like she's a year and a

49
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.970
half off herself.
Right.
Like right into a title fight,

50
00:02:48.971 --> 00:02:53.710
which I have to say I'm a little bit envious of because when I beat Misha,

51
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.100
I,
when,
uh,
I was supposed to coach the ultimate fighter,

52
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.450
but that was all ultimately going to up in a title shot with Rhonda and I blew

53
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:06.451
my knee and my husband passed away and there was like a long moment of silence

54
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:09.160
in there.
And then when I was able to come back,

55
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:13.180
they made me return my title shot,
you know?
And so it was like,
wait,
oh,

56
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:15.200
we're doing that now.
Or just like we'll do

57
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.600
<v 1>Penn on like what,
what attractive contenders are available.
Like what?</v>

58
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.190
It looks good.

59
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.280
<v 0>I agree.
Yeah.
I mean it was very young at that,
at that age or that at the time.</v>

60
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.770
<v 1>Right.
And in Bantam weight right now there's like,</v>

61
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.480
there's no standout contender and Raquel had beaten some really good fighters

62
00:03:32.481 --> 00:03:36.260
and she looked like the next in line.
And did she blow her knee out as well?

63
00:03:36.261 --> 00:03:37.094
She has

64
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.290
<v 0>not like,
oh,
I could be lying,</v>

65
00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:42.870
but I think she gotten like some accident with a four wheeler,

66
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.630
like rolled over and broke her leg or something.

67
00:03:45.631 --> 00:03:47.580
I could like totally be making that up though.

68
00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:50.070
She could have just twisted it walking down the street too,
so

69
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.510
<v 1>vaguely remember some engine.
Yeah.</v>
