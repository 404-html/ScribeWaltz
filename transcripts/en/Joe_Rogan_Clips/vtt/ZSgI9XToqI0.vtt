00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.700
Her low freak bitches.
How are you sir?
I'm very good,
Joe.
It's good to meet you,

2
00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:07.770
man.
Great to meet you.
And thank you very much for doing this.

3
00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:11.790
I've learned more about coyotes over the last couple of months reading your book

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.970
and listening to your podcast with my good friend Steve Rinella,

5
00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:19.590
which was amazing.
Oh,
what a crazy animal that is.
You know,

6
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:24.550
I have coyotes all around my neighborhood and uh,
it became a very,
um,

7
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.030
it's very close to me when I saw one of my chickens get captured by a coyote and

8
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.230
I watched him hop the fence where the chicken in his mouth,
boy,
God damn,

9
00:00:34.231 --> 00:00:37.560
these mother fuckers and just all around us.
Especially,

10
00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:40.410
I live in a fairly rural area around here.

11
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.190
I'm about a 40 minutes outside of La,
so it's,
you know,

12
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.180
the nights are quiet and you hear him screaming in the night and I didn't know

13
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:51.150
much about them until I started reading your book,
man.
Yeah,

14
00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:53.370
they're amazing animal.
I mean,
I think,
uh,

15
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.430
there's not really another mammal aside from us that has a biography lock these

16
00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:04.450
animals do.
And that's kind of one of the reasons I got fascinated with them.
Uh,

17
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.940
they were doing the same thing around me when I was a kid growing up in

18
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.870
Louisiana.
I mean,
and that's sort of the beginning of my,

19
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.040
uh,

20
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.520
my getting captivated by these little small wolves because they were suddenly

21
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:24.330
showing up in the bayous and swamps of Louisiana when I was 12,
13,

22
00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:25.230
14 years old.

23
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.880
And as far as I knew this was an animal that was supposed to be in the deserts

24
00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:34.830
of the West.
And so that seemed to be something that,
you know,

25
00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:39.540
commanded a one's attention,
that this critter is,

26
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.790
is appearing in places where you would never expect it.
Uh,

27
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.920
and now of course everybody in the country is dealing with them.

28
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.810
That is so fascinating that in our lifetime they have spread from the American

29
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:56.250
southwest to every single state and literally every single city in the country.

30
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.500
Yeah,
it's true.
And I just got a,

31
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.740
somebody sent me this yesterday that somewhere in Georgia they have some sort of

32
00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:08.430
a bounty on these wolves.
Coyotes.

33
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.670
That's what one thing a lot of people don't realize that a coyote is a wolf.

34
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.860
Yeah.
It's a,
it's a separate species from gray wolves in red wolves,

35
00:02:16.861 --> 00:02:21.840
but it's out of the North American wolf line.
Uh,

36
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.500
I mean Kyries are distinctively North American animals.

37
00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:30.390
They come out of Canaan evolution that began here 5.3 million years ago.
So,

38
00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:34.170
um,
yeah,
they're,
they're small wolves.
And I send you this Jamie.
No,

39
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.050
you found it beautiful.
This is the Georgia coyote challenge.

40
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:41.220
Apparently they're offering some sort of bounty for each coyote killed.

41
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.680
Now what's fascinating about this,

42
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:48.540
and one of the things that I learned from your book is that when a coyote yells,

43
00:02:48.541 --> 00:02:52.470
when they're doing their call in the night,
they're essentially making roll call.

44
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.290
And when one of them doesn't respond,

45
00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.130
the female generates more pups.
Yeah.
It's a,

46
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.200
it's one of the,
you know,

47
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:04.390
one of the many things that's probably happening when they're,

48
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.253
when they're howling.

49
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.260
I mean they are taking a census basically of of coyote populations in the area.

50
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.280
And the result of,

51
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.800
of that census can very well be,

52
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:22.801
it produces some sort of a chemical or a metabolic change in the females,

53
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:26.410
the breeding females,
the Alpha ones,

54
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.330
and they end up oftentimes having larger litters of pups,

55
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.400
which is why something like this,
you know,

56
00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:37.450
I was just in South Carolina two weeks ago and there was a lot of conversation

57
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:41.370
about this,
this Georgia bounty,
because in South Carolina,

58
00:03:41.371 --> 00:03:44.140
it's another place where coyotes are,
are fairly new.

59
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.090
I've only been there in the last 20 or 25 years.
They were arguing that,

60
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.070
you know,
and they had some pretty good science that coyotes are taking,
you know,

61
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:55.150
in some areas,

62
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:59.410
as many as 60% of the white tail deer fawns.

63
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.570
And so the hunters are screaming a long and loud about this because it means

64
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:07.330
it's getting harder to take a whitetail.

65
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.860
So South Carolina hasn't moved to the step that Georgia has of trying to impose

66
00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:19.030
some kind of bounty and encourage people to go out and shoot these animals,

67
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.440
uh,
to take them in any way they can,
but mostly shoot them.

68
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.020
Uh,
but you know,

69
00:04:26.021 --> 00:04:31.021
I think these states in the south and in the east have a lot to learn by the

70
00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:37.021
western or from the Western experience because the truth is we've been trying to

71
00:04:37.091 --> 00:04:37.990
eradicate,

72
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.280
and I mean totally exterminate coyotes in the American west.

73
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:43.421
Uh,

74
00:04:43.421 --> 00:04:48.421
we spent the years from about 1915 through about 1972 and an all out war

75
00:04:50.261 --> 00:04:54.460
attempting to exterminate them.
And the only result of that,

76
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.301
uh,

77
00:04:55.301 --> 00:05:00.250
as a result of their particular kinds of adaptations in their evolution in North

78
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:05.050
America,
uh,
is that we spread them across the entire country.

79
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.310
We not only spread them across the entire country,
I mean,
they're in every state.

80
00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:13.240
They colonized their 49th state,
Delaware in 2010.
So the only state,

81
00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:17.620
they're not in his Hawaii just because they have a stowed away and made it

82
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.430
across the Pacific yet.
And,
uh,
you know,
I mean,
if they do,

83
00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:25.330
you can imagine that those endangered Naynay's on the big island are totally

84
00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:26.164
done for,

85
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.010
but they are not only in every single state in the union except for a why,

86
00:05:30.011 --> 00:05:35.011
but they are 7,000 miles now north and south and North America from above the

87
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.470
Arctic Circle,

88
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.470
all the way down to Central America and beginning to colonize into South

89
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:48.040
America.
So the attempts to exterminate them,
I mean,

90
00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:50.080
and I can explain how this,

91
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.140
why this happens has to do with their evolution and the particular deputations

92
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.790
they have,

93
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.940
but the attempts to exterminate them or even to try to control their numbers

94
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.720
almost always produces exactly the opposite effect.

95
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.750
So Georgia is going to end up with more coyotes than they've ever had before in

96
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:12.930
their efforts to try to suppress their population.
Isn't that fascinating?
Yeah,

97
00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:13.803
it is.

98
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:23.050
<v 1>Yeah.</v>
