1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.490
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.540
And I also think that like reality at some point will always supersede nerf

3
00:00:09.271 --> 00:00:12.690
padding.
You know,
there's always going to be a push back on that.
We go look like,

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.390
I don't want to offend anybody,
but you know,

5
00:00:15.391 --> 00:00:19.170
and I do agree that there's a movement by the left that really does push,

6
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.080
you know,
I did a thing,
reason,
I'm doing this a charity event for uh,

7
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.250
like an urban program for kids.
Um,

8
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.510
mainly inner city black kids and I'm hosting it with my,
uh,
my buddy Mike Yard.

9
00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:37.380
He's a really funny comic black dude and we went to meet with the guys for this

10
00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:40.230
charity and they were telling us that,
uh,
you know,

11
00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:43.530
were they have an auction and at any charity event,
right?

12
00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:46.050
An auctioneer comes out and they all try to auction off and raise a lot of money

13
00:00:46.051 --> 00:00:47.460
from rich people to help the program.

14
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.470
That's a very basically 99.9% of every charity event I've ever been involved.

15
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:56.160
This has an auction segment of the,
in the dinner they were like,

16
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.190
we're going to have that,
but we can't use the word auction.
I said,
what?

17
00:01:00.191 --> 00:01:02.550
What do you mean you can't use the word auction?
They're like,

18
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.560
it's a sensitive word for you know the community.
And I was like,

19
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.230
and then yard goes,
are you talking about slavery?

20
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.450
Like his head almost exploded.
He was like,
wait,
we can't.
And I was like,
wait,

21
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:17.460
we can't say the word auction.
I'm like,

22
00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:19.440
but aren't you hiring a guy from Southerby's?
Yeah,

23
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.930
his card's going to say auctioneer on it.

24
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.110
We're just going to pretend that's not what he's called.
And they were just like,

25
00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:27.390
we just don't feel comfortable with that word in the room.

26
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.180
And I was just going to,
I can't see,
I said,
guys,

27
00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:33.270
I gotta tell you it like you're making me want to vote for Trump.

28
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.540
That's what I said.
That's it.
That's how dumb I think this is.

29
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.210
I'm like all agree to it cause I want to help these kids.

30
00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:42.150
But this is one of the dumbest things I've ever heard.
Wow.
I couldn't believe.

31
00:01:42.151 --> 00:01:46.800
I was like,
can I say cotton?
Am I allowed to say like what other words can I say?

32
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.170
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard.
You're going to get triggered actions.

33
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.260
Auctions.
It's going to make a joke.

34
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.690
Like we're not going to joke around about like auctioning off a black person.

35
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.920
Although yard and I probably would have,
but first of all,

36
00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:01.190
like when you say auction,
you automatically think of that boy,

37
00:02:01.191 --> 00:02:03.320
it's not going to avoid taking a hold of this.
I'm going to want and want to.

38
00:02:03.321 --> 00:02:07.230
Why do you think they did that with when they were doing that with slaves?

39
00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:10.380
I do not think they talked like that.
I don't know what their technique was,

40
00:02:10.381 --> 00:02:13.950
but I do know when I think of the word auction,
I'm not like,
Oh,
don't say that.

41
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.870
Don't say a word.
Don't say a word.
It's like it's an,
it's a new league.

42
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.740
It's absolutely accepted.
It's a different thing now.
Yeah.
It's like the word gay.

43
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.020
It's used to be Flinstones gay.
Have a okay time.

44
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.580
Having a gay time was like,

45
00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:34.020
we're out having a good old time and then it became gay and then you had to stop

46
00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:37.280
saying it that way,
but you can't just go back to gay happy like Flint.

47
00:02:37.281 --> 00:02:38.520
So you can't,
but you can't.

48
00:02:38.521 --> 00:02:42.330
For me growing up was the thing we just said about everything all the time.

49
00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:47.030
Everything's good.
Doesn't matter.
Like the only thing you could,
you know it was,

50
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.580
it was terrible.
Did Gay go bad?
I don't know.
That's a good question.

51
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.570
It went bad after the f word went bad.
Did it?
Yeah,
effluent from,

52
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.660
was it connecting the two of them fucking gay and they're like,
whoa,
no,
no,

53
00:02:57.661 --> 00:02:59.980
not fucking.
I meant the word for gay people.

54
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:02.650
That to your body to say in fact that,
no,
I'm not afraid to,

55
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:06.100
but I'm just kind of being sarcastic when I say yes,
we're at the other f word.

56
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.780
It's like the other white meat.
Yeah,
exactly.
Like that was the,
and not that long.

57
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.430
And it was,
it was this idea of like if something was stupid,
it was gay,

58
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.560
it didn't mean homosexual.
It meant like Knob to don't be so gay,

59
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.640
but then you start thinking about,
oh I guess it does.

60
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.810
I guess it's offensive because you're saying like that stupid shirt you're

61
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:29.140
wearing is gay.
Of course it's that way.

62
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:32.300
But isn't it weird that gay took a turn for the worst?
Yeah.

63
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.880
Wouldn't you have loved to been at the intersection when gay went bad?
Like Pho,

64
00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:41.350
we'll have a gay old time that's gay.
Yeah.
Whoa.

65
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.140
What are you saying?
Like an intersection of 36 came to me.

66
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.650
One overran it,
the mean one beat the happy gay.
It did.

67
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.140
Um,
gay took that.

68
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.090
They took the word gay and turns it into either a negative like,

69
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.610
oh that's gay or homosexuality.
Yep.

70
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.010
How was it not connected to homosexuality before?
I don't know.

71
00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:08.920
I don't know if the connection came from the fact that like they're like,

72
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:11.770
oh those guys that gay shit,
like,
and they were like being like,

73
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.550
cause they were being like,
really?
You know how happy they were?

74
00:04:15.551 --> 00:04:18.250
Like flamboyant boy.
Like,
well that guy's gay,
Huh?
He's really gay.

75
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.620
Like a gay is with that shiny shirt on,
you know,

76
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.440
hey that Liberace show her as gay.
And then maybe someone was like,

77
00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:26.710
I'll show you gay and next thing you know people like,
hey,
we gotta,

78
00:04:26.711 --> 00:04:28.720
we gotta stop.
We should stop with that word.

79
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:30.540
Come up with a new word gaze at different things.
Yeah.

80
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.220
Because I asked the guy to get gay with me and it got really,

81
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.600
really uncomfortable.

82
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.250
There had to be like a time in between where it was real confusing.

83
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.100
Right.
Where they didn't,
hadn't fully established what it meant yet,

84
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.900
where people were like,
hey man,
are you gay?
Yes,
I am gay.

85
00:04:46.901 --> 00:04:51.580
I'm having a gale time guys like Goodman guy tackles him in the bushes.
Yup.

86
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.420
Like,
uh,
like the word hookup changed.
Yeah.

87
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.510
Like right around like when I was in high school,
but like my dad would be like,

88
00:04:58.511 --> 00:05:00.520
hey,
are you going to hook up with your friends tonight?
You know what I mean?

89
00:05:00.521 --> 00:05:04.810
And I'd be like,
what would it mean?

90
00:05:04.811 --> 00:05:07.410
It means meet up with your friends.
I'm like,
that's not what it means.
You know,

91
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.400
like all my buddies would be in the room like,
hey,

92
00:05:09.401 --> 00:05:11.860
you guys are going to hook up tonight with that.
I'm like,
don't touch it ever.

93
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.150
It was like,
dude,
your dad's gay.

94
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.940
Don't be so good.
That's hilarious.
So funny.
A lot of language shifts occur.

95
00:05:21.941 --> 00:05:24.790
What it does feel like right now there's more policing of it and there's more

96
00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:29.320
people act.
I Dunno,
there's just like,
there's a lot like the word pussy.
Yeah.

97
00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.730
Is One of those where you can't say pussy anymore.
No.
People get offended by it.

98
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.700
I'm like,
cause he is like,
you're getting offended by the word,

99
00:05:36.701 --> 00:05:39.940
but unless you're overusing it.
No,
no.
I'm saying again,

100
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.030
what I say or don't say is what I say or don't say it.

101
00:05:43.031 --> 00:05:47.110
I take my licks if I have to,
but people get offended by it.
You know,

102
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.580
like that's a word now that like if you're,
you know,

103
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.820
if you're in like a hardcore leftist community,
you wouldn't say pussy,

104
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.890
but you'll still say dick guys being a deck.
It's like,
well that's offensive.

105
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.840
Those communities need a hug.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I feel like they don't need a hug.

106
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.520
Actually.
I feel like they need,
like I have too many hugs,
you know?

107
00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:10.170
I think there's just too much.
I think it really,

108
00:06:10.171 --> 00:06:12.320
it goes back to our lives are easy now,

109
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.710
so we have a lot of free time to come up with bullshit.
Yeah,
we do.

110
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.690
It's like if we had to actually,

111
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.560
we didn't have electricity or we didn't have like all this ease,
we wouldn't be,

112
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.310
you know,
harping on this stuff.
It's just like,
you have a lot of downtime,

113
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.590
a lot of downtime.
So you're like,
I'll start a blog.

114
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.770
I think I'll start blogging about words.
You shouldn't say it.

115
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:39.580
<v 1>Okay.</v>
