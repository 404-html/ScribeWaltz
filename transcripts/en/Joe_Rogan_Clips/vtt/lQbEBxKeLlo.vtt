1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
I asked him,
uh,
they asked me to get him on and I was like,
Eh,

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.160
I think I'm going to duck to that one.
But he's fucking eccentric and crazy.

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.700
He's alone and,
and so's this Randy and they,
they,

4
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:13.170
they've known each other forever.

5
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.320
And are they friends while they were real till all this shit started and,

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.290
oh,
it's fucking classic Randy.

7
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.460
<v 1>It goes radical left.
He used to do,</v>

8
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.300
he did a comedy album years ago.

9
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.690
It was him and a bunch of other guys and it was all,

10
00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:34.200
it was all political.

11
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.980
It was like five guys or three a few guys.

12
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:41.380
I forget how many guy think Crimmins was on it.
Oh sure.
It's critical.

13
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.020
And uh,
maybe Jimmy tingle.
Yup.
Yeah.

14
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.730
And they had like a whole thing they were doing almost like a,
like a tour,

15
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.990
you know,
like super left wing,
politically aware.

16
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.480
But this is fucking way back in the day.

17
00:00:57.481 --> 00:00:59.760
I want to say this is the 90s they were doing this.

18
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.950
<v 0>No,
I mean he was,
he was,
he was always funny.
I mean,</v>

19
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.070
I've watched him die every night at the,
uh,

20
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.820
catch rising stock cause he's hit me up to doing such inside political shit.

21
00:01:09.821 --> 00:01:12.640
He'd be talking about a bill that was passed that day on the floor or whatever

22
00:01:12.641 --> 00:01:16.510
the fuck and the crowd would be staring at him and he had a hot Asian girlfriend

23
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.600
and he'd be dying up there.
This is what I fell in love with them and he goes,

24
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.920
he goes,
that's my girlfriend over there.
I taught her a forwards and English,

25
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.180
not you crowd suck.

26
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.450
I mean he was really fucking funny but so political and inside and accent.

27
00:01:34.451 --> 00:01:37.790
But he stayed at my apartment when I lived out here in la and he fucking like

28
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.870
tried to pick up my wife after I left.
I had to go on the road somewhere,

29
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.690
but I still love him.
He's fucking crazy.
But he,

30
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.380
he sent me a picture of him,
uh,

31
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.400
2016 in front of the embassy in London where,

32
00:01:51.401 --> 00:01:55.270
what's his name was held up aside.
Really?
Yes.
And I'm like,

33
00:01:55.271 --> 00:01:57.400
what the fuck is going on?
What's he doing out there?

34
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.160
And then all that shit came out about wikileaks and stuff.

35
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.570
So they thought he might've been the intermediary.
Yeah.

36
00:02:04.571 --> 00:02:06.090
So he's gone in front of Roger Stone.

37
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.680
He's gone in front of model or a couple of times and,
and uh,

38
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.410
so there it is right here.

39
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.770
Who is Randy credico don't threaten to take away apartment associates dog if he

40
00:02:17.921 --> 00:02:22.870
cooperated with Russia.
Investigate what he threatened to take away his dog.
Oh,

41
00:02:22.871 --> 00:02:25.840

They're public.

42
00:02:25.841 --> 00:02:29.320
I think what's sent to Randy.
I'm going to take your dog.
Oh yeah.
He goes,

43
00:02:29.321 --> 00:02:33.620
let's get it on.
Beat the pred to die.
Oh,
I'm going to take you a fucking,

44
00:02:33.621 --> 00:02:34.454
that's why I love this guy.

45
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.670
This guy had a Nixon Tattoo when he was 18 on his back.
Well,

46
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.140
I just don't do it as he marched in the gay parade in New York.

47
00:02:41.141 --> 00:02:45.200
I fucking love him.
He's nuts.
Why do you in the getting crazy pro gay rights?

48
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.640
He's pro just,
yeah.
You know,
so he's just all over the place.

49
00:02:48.641 --> 00:02:51.640
He's all over the place,
but he's a right,
I mean,
he had a Nixon Tac toe.

50
00:02:51.641 --> 00:02:53.710
It's a fucking right wing.
But,
uh,

51
00:02:53.711 --> 00:02:56.170
all the right wing people to get look at this look,

52
00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.510
that is so ridiculous.
The fucking next,
that's a good tattoo too.

53
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.990
I know guys,
60 something years old at least.

54
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.720
And He loved my radio show on Sirius and,
and he,
uh,
he did,
he hosted info was,

55
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.780
it was about six months ago.

56
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:14.500
He had me on as a guest when I got punched in the face by that broad oh,

57
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:18.910
that's right.
I forgot about.
So,
uh,
so yeah,
they rated the FBI,
raided his house,

58
00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:22.630
took him out today and then you get out on to $250,000 bond.

59
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.890
And um,
he wanted credit co,
you know,

60
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.960
to stop contesting what,

61
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.470
what stone said in front of when he testified.

62
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.600
So still say that's not how it went down,
blah,
blah.

63
00:03:35.601 --> 00:03:40.400
So they are fighting and shit and then he's threatening.
Um,
and um,
but uh,
yeah,

64
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.710
I Randy.
So I text Randy today.
I go,
I'm doing Rogan.
I mean,

65
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:48.490
if you want to walk away,
and he's like,
well,
call me before the show.
Let me know.

66
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.710
He goes,
there's not too much.
I can say right now,

67
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.550
but what's funny is I know both these guys.
That is so weird.
That's so weird.

68
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.610
And he said,
yeah,
let me know.
He goes,

69
00:03:57.611 --> 00:04:01.620
I can't say much because they just arrested the FBI.
They use,

70
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.300
they're going to turn.
They tried to,
I see what Mala is doing.

71
00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:07.690
He's turning Roger Stone against Trump.
Trump is the target.
Yeah.

72
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.300
So he's going to threaten him with,
you know,

73
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.700
he's 60 something years old so he could spend the rest of his life in prison or

74
00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:17.260
talk,
you know,
he's a scary guy.
Mueller,
if he,

75
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:21.890
if you had a problem and that guy was coming after you,
thank God,

76
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.470
because he's going to do it slow.
Like by the time this actually gets into Trump,

77
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.360
he's going to be,
I don't think they do that slow.
They do.
They start sweating.

78
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.180
They want,
I think that's different than anyway.

79
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.670
I'm very confused.
Time they get to Trump.
He's already so nerve racked.

80
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.691
You know what I'm saying?

81
00:04:40.691 --> 00:04:45.691
Because he liked chips away at his borders like slowly but surely takes away all

82
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:49.420
the people around him.
Yeah,
he gets closer and you know,
you know,

83
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.110
you know he's concentrating on the family and know.
Oh of course.
Of course.

84
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:56.490
Of course.
That's what he does.
And he does that with people like stone.

85
00:04:56.491 --> 00:04:59.890
He'll go after your family and stuff and you notice you never hear a word out of

86
00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:04.360
Ivanka anymore.
No,
exactly.
Yeah,
yeah.
Guarantee you.

87
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.460
Guarantee you they scared the fuck out of her.

88
00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:09.850
But if you want to know about Mandala like you said and how fucking creepy he
is,

89
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.120
he was the head of the FBI during the 80s of the Whitey bulges.

90
00:05:13.121 --> 00:05:16.900
Shit went down and he put four guys in PR.

91
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.550
He listened to this Joe and this,
you can look this up.
This isn't me.

92
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.710
Four guys he put in prison and wrongly it turns out two of them died in prison.

93
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.920
Whoa.
Yeah.
You can go because of Bulger and it had to do with that,
cause.
