1
00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.830
Her low freak bitches.
Exactly.
I know nobody has notes.

2
00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:08.550
Everyone has like a little like a business card with three bullet points on it.

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.950
And I'm a little more of the,
you know,

4
00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:15.750
the Shandling tons and tons of paper until you're drowning and confused.
Shan.

5
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.040
You know,
that's a sad one man.
Well Fun Dude.

6
00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:24.720
That was oh the best.
And I'm doing a documentary about him now for Hbo.

7
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.180
And so the most fun part about it is he always went to the comedy magic club and

8
00:00:30.181 --> 00:00:33.300
did stand up even in eras where you didn't know he was doing it.

9
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.000
That's where I met him at the comedy Magic Club.
Yeah.
And how was it?

10
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.990
That was great.
Yeah,
he's just,
I mean it was like for me,

11
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.130
I was a huge fan of Larry Sanders show and Larry Sanders show a,

12
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.000
that's where Paul Simms got start producer of news radio.
And so when I,

13
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.450
you know,
when I saw him I was like,
it was one of those ones like,
oh wow,

14
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.810
that's a,
that's actually Garry Shandling right there,
right?

15
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.470
There were Judd Apatow right there.
It's a weird one.
And He,

16
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.830
and you know the comedy magical,
they tape every show since the 80s.

17
00:01:01.831 --> 00:01:04.340
They have every show taped.
And I said,

18
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.550
can you give me the last 50 sets that Gary did?

19
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.300
The comedy Magic Club.
And this is,
you know,
from the last few years.

20
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.230
And no one's ever seen any of these jokes except that people at those shows,

21
00:01:16.231 --> 00:01:19.290
he didn't do him on TV.
He didn't do 'em on talk shows.
There was no special,

22
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.480
some of the funniest jokes you've ever heard.
Just him,
you know,

23
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.810
working on the graph.
How about going around being so funny?

24
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.060
Yeah,
but he,
he did a lot of notes.
He was,
uh,
his discipline guy.

25
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.290
He was in his seventies.
He wrote so many jokes.

26
00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:38.670
I found these binders,

27
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.170
hundreds and hundreds of jokes in every loose leaf binder.

28
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.350
Like a guy sitting at a desk all day just crafting like two sentence perfect

29
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.260
jokes.
Yeah,
but there's like the balance,
right?
There's that,

30
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.770
there's crafting the perfect jokes and then there's just being able to be loose

31
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.890
and fun and hilarious.
Well,

32
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:03.240
he also used to go on stage with a justice set up and he wouldn't know the

33
00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:05.880
punchline and he would say to setup and hope the punchline came,

34
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.940
which is pretty wild.
He,
um,
you know,
one of the,

35
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.040
one of the great things about doing a documentary as you get to ask people for

36
00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:17.320
footage.
So Seinfeld gave me,
uh,

37
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.930
the dailies for Comedians in cars getting coffee when he interviewed Gary.

38
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.370
And then the people who made the movie comedian about Seinfeld gave me all the

39
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:31.110
dailies of a sequence that they only use 10 seconds over the documentary,

40
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.970
which was Gary and Jerry going to the comedy magic club and doing sets.

41
00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:37.780
And also there that night as Neil and,

42
00:02:37.781 --> 00:02:41.100
and Chris Rock and there's 12 tapes.

43
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.780
It's all their performances and then their entire conversation for three hours

44
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.610
hanging out backstage.
And it is unbelievable the conversation,

45
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.460
how funny it is.
And,
uh,

46
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.270
there's a moment where Chris rock is doing the joke about how Nelson Mandela got

47
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:04.450
divorced,
that even Nelson Mandela,
after decades of being in prison,

48
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:08.140
he could survive that,
but he couldn't survive getting out and being buried.

49
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:10.930
He gets divorced immediately.
I forgot how we worded it,

50
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.410
but there's a shot of Shandling alone in a green room watching rock do this bit

51
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.520
and as he's doing it,
Gary's like saying what he,

52
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.710
what he's like,
he's guessing what the bit is as rock saying it,

53
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:29.860
but in all of Chris Rock and it's a,

54
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:34.390
it's a really beautiful moment and that's what the best part of doing in this

55
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:38.530
documentary is it just finding little magical moments that no one would ever see

56
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:41.510
if you didn't dig deep.
What made you decide to do this?
No,

57
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.530
we did a memorial for Gary when he died at the Wilshire Ebell theater,

58
00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.180
like a thousand people showed up and I made about five mini documentaries about

59
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:58.000
Gary to show in between the speakers and I thought,
oh,

60
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.440
this is a documentary.
I should just expand this.
And now it's like,

61
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.570
now it's like the Oj doc of Gary.
It's a big long epic documentary.

62
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.610
I think people don't realize how good the Larry Sanders show was.
Yeah.

63
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.330
Like people forgot,
you know,
if he'd go back and watch it again,

64
00:04:14.331 --> 00:04:17.380
I mean that was a revolutionary show.
When it was on the air,
it really was,
well,

65
00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:22.120
people don't go backwards.
Like my kids don't go backwards digging that far.

66
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.100
Like to them,
you know,

67
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.200
looking backwards means I'll watch all of parks and REC,
right?

68
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.240
They're not taking into the 90s.
Right?
Uh,

69
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.520
they go to 2015 and people forget that when the Larry Sanders show came on the

70
00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:39.220
air,
you know,
the shows on Hbo,

71
00:04:39.221 --> 00:04:44.170
it was like a first and 10 are not necessarily the news or dream on,
you know,

72
00:04:44.171 --> 00:04:49.171
Gary was the first show on HBO that made Hbo go,

73
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.160
Oh,
this is what HBO should be.
We should be the quality,

74
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.470
uh,
network with the old,
with this kind of groundbreaking television.

75
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.850
And,
uh,
you know,
Gary was a guy who got offered all the talk shows.

76
00:05:03.851 --> 00:05:06.220
He got offered to replace Letterman.
Um,

77
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.590
he was hosting the tonight show for Johnny.
Uh,
Haman Leno would,
would,
uh,

78
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.750
take turns doing it.
And he decided he rather satirize it then do it.

79
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.280
And he wanted to explore the people and not be a talk show hosts.

80
00:05:22.281 --> 00:05:24.940
He wanted to show like the world of ego.

81
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.780
That is not just talk shows but just show business.

82
00:05:28.781 --> 00:05:32.470
He was fascinated with people's need for attention,
his own need for attention,

83
00:05:32.471 --> 00:05:36.790
his own vanity and narcissism.
And he wanted to explore that and,

84
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.800
and satirize how we just want to be liked so badly.

85
00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:44.410
Like what we do to be liked,

86
00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:47.470
which prevents us from actually feeling love.

87
00:05:47.471 --> 00:05:49.330
Cause we're so obsessed with approval.
