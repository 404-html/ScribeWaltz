1
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:02.470
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.170
<v 1>Well,
that's a good thing.
That's that suck.
The more sensitive you are though,</v>

3
00:00:08.171 --> 00:00:11.440
the more you have to consider all the possibilities and that that's what could

4
00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:16.430
keep you up.
People sleeping.
Right.
We talked about that,
right?

5
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.640
For the podcast.
Yeah.
There's this guy that's coming on.

6
00:00:18.641 --> 00:00:23.260
His name's Dr Robert Schoch can easy geologists from Boston University and he's

7
00:00:23.261 --> 00:00:24.094
worked on,

8
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.260
there's some real scientists that believe it's entirely possible that the sphinx

9
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.400
and a lot of the construction in Egypt is far older than they think.

10
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.300
<v 0>Do you know others to know about Robert Shaw can run off how much of religion</v>

11
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.880
has occurred around the base or around the pit that the,

12
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.380
and it absolutely couldn't have been done depending on like the way the Sphinx

13
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:48.090
is built,
where it's located,

14
00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:53.070
the sighting where it's level is,
is far older.

15
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.590
So

16
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.160
<v 1>yes,</v>

17
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.160
they think it was somewhere in the neighborhood of 9,000 plus BC because that's

18
00:00:59.651 --> 00:00:59.890
the law.

19
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.570
When back then the Nile Valley was a rain forest and somehow or another it

20
00:01:04.571 --> 00:01:07.500
became a desert.
And this guy's,
you know,

21
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.360
legit Boston University professor,
geologist,

22
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.490
and he's traveling all over the place,

23
00:01:12.491 --> 00:01:17.491
but he's here for some Ufo conference and the Ufo people wanted to him to

24
00:01:17.651 --> 00:01:22.420
mention the UFO conference.
And I'm like,
fucking Christ with Ufo conferences,

25
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.390
you guys don't have anything.
If you had something,
it could be,

26
00:01:25.391 --> 00:01:28.810
what are you gonna get together and a fucking Marriott somewhere and show,

27
00:01:28.811 --> 00:01:33.190
show some blurry picture of some fucking a hubcap that someone chucked up into

28
00:01:33.191 --> 00:01:35.580
the air.
Like there's nothing.
Everything that,

29
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.540
everything that they look at falls apart under scrutiny.
There's a few videos.

30
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.890
<v 0>Okay,
I'm going to push back.
Please do.
Please do.
Let's just say,
what about,</v>

31
00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:47.060
do you know the discovery disclosure disclosure project?
Okay.

32
00:01:47.061 --> 00:01:50.810
There was their first press conference when they got all the,
I'm,
I'm,

33
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.010
I tend to be impressed by the military,
you know,
ranking members.

34
00:01:55.011 --> 00:01:56.450
I'm sort of like,
ah,
if you were,

35
00:01:56.451 --> 00:02:00.410
if you were guarding missile silos and you say you saw something hover above it

36
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.440
and deactivate,
you know,

37
00:02:03.441 --> 00:02:05.750
I'm probably going to check that out a little harder.

38
00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:10.040
And there were just so many people that stood up,
you know,

39
00:02:10.041 --> 00:02:13.700
in that press conference and said that they absolutely had seen evidence,

40
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.330
met extra terrestrials seeing the crafts,

41
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.160
like in hangars,
et cetera.
And to me,

42
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.000
like I,
they didn't look like they had that much imagination.

43
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:29.300
They're the kind of people that I didn't think could really,
I mean,

44
00:02:29.301 --> 00:02:32.900
did you find that convincing at all?
No,
no,
no.

45
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.550
Just like a whole bunch of liars,
a whole line of liar disclosure project.

46
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.930
It's not so much about him.

47
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.680
He doesn't appeal to me as much as the people that he brought on who were mostly

48
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.543
millet

49
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.040
<v 1>of the thing about military.</v>

50
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.030
Anybody who's in the military is a person.

51
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.120
If you get a hundred people together,
one of them is out of their fucking mind.

52
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.340
If you get a million people,

53
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.720
you've got a shit ton of people that are out of their fucking mind that are

54
00:02:58.721 --> 00:03:02.950
running that one extra attention.
One of the best ways to say you're you are,

55
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:05.800
one of the best ways to get extra tension is to say you've had some

56
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:08.380
extraordinary experience that separates you from the pack.

57
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.820
It's one of the main points of delusion that people that are really out of their

58
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:16.330
fucking mind,
well it won't want to point to.
I see things in people.

59
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.100
I can read Auras,
I can tell I'm a psychic healer,

60
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.540
I'm an intuitive person.

61
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:25.990
They all have this thing that separates them from the herd without any work

62
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:26.824
whatsoever.

63
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.870
I feel like a lot of these people are that they want attention and so they tell

64
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:34.720
these extraordinary stories.
Now when you said they're not creative,

65
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.290
that's a very astute point cause they all have the same fucking story cause it's

66
00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:40.090
the same story that's been going on forever.

67
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.980
They just repeat shit they've already heard.

68
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.150
Most of these people I think are full of Shit I think is entirely possible.

69
00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:49.610
That UFO is a been here entirely possible that see people have seen you at foes

70
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.690
entirely possible.
But a lot of those people,

71
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.780
my fucking bullshit radar just goes off by

72
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:55.683
<v 0>bang,
Bang,
Bang.</v>

73
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.710
<v 1>Yeah,
I,
I've talked to too many of them and when I did that television show,</v>

74
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.950
Joe Rogan questions everything,
and I met with you FOP,
Blinn bigfoot people.

75
00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:04.390
I was telling you before the podcast,

76
00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:08.470
it cured me cause I got to be around those people for hours and just talk to
him.

77
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.460
No cameras on.
I'm like,
oh,
you're fucking crazy.
Or you're delusional.

78
00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:16.300
Or your way of looking at things is not objective or you're talking to me

79
00:04:16.301 --> 00:04:17.560
because you want to convince me or something.

80
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:19.870
You're not just communicating the ideas that are actually in your head.

81
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.990
You're pitching me some sort of a speech.
You're like,

82
00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:26.230
you've got some sort of a performance you're doing for me.
I smell it.

83
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.400
And as a performer I smell it.
I'm like,
this is nonsense.
You telling me nonsense.

84
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.500
You know,
they were telling you you want evidence.

85
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:34.330
I'll back a truck up and show you the evidence.
I'm like,

86
00:04:34.331 --> 00:04:35.230
where's your fucking evidence?

87
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.960
<v 0>You don't have any other audit it today.
Yeah.
Well,
here's the thing.</v>

88
00:04:38.961 --> 00:04:43.961
Did they seem as off kilter in everything else they talked about relationships,

89
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.960
relationship,

90
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.380
<v 1>herbs,
jobs.
They're all screwballs.
They're almost all screw balls.</v>

91
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.730
The people that are most convincing are the people that see these orbs flying

92
00:04:53.731 --> 00:04:55.500
around the pilots.
Yeah.
Well,

93
00:04:55.501 --> 00:04:59.310
the reason why they see these things is there's a real phenomenon called ball

94
00:04:59.311 --> 00:04:59.821
lightning.

95
00:04:59.821 --> 00:05:04.821
It's absolutely real and it's caused by various weather conditions and they

96
00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:09.960
think that he gave in because sometimes by the right weather conditions and the

97
00:05:09.961 --> 00:05:13.740
shifting of tectonic plates that somehow or another the friction.
Yes,

98
00:05:13.741 --> 00:05:17.010
and that these ball ball lightning,
if you've ever seen videos of it,

99
00:05:17.011 --> 00:05:18.990
it's phenomenal.
It just flies around.

100
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.170
They've even had an inside airplanes somehow or another ball.

101
00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:26.820
Lightning has shot down the aisle of an airplane while I was in Florida actually

102
00:05:26.821 --> 00:05:31.380
seen it.
Have you really enlightening on a flight that was struck by lightning?

103
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.880
Whoa.

104
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.860
It was pink and it sounded like a giant BB gun.

105
00:05:37.861 --> 00:05:42.420
Hid a tin can.
Oh yeah.
Oh,
you were in a plane.

106
00:05:42.421 --> 00:05:46.530
That was hit by lightning.
Yes.
Holy Shit.

107
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:47.730
That's intense.

108
00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.830
<v 2>Okay.</v>
