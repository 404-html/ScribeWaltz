1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.110
Interesting for doom.

2
00:00:01.111 --> 00:00:05.370
Just released a statement saying that you saw to asked him to snitch.

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.800
I know what's going on with the snitch and stuff.
I don't know.

4
00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:12.030
They offered him a Alene more lenient sentence if he's willing to snitch and he

5
00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:16.710
goes,
fuck you.
And John to the,

6
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.160
I guess John was like,
cool.
I don't know.
I don't either.

7
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.760
I that's what they're saying.
I don't need a John snitched.
Did you hear Johnston?

8
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.220
That's,
that's what the statement says.

9
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.980
But John's manager says that he didn't stay what statement from who?

10
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.470
The statements from him,

11
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.970
his manager skeptically at buffets.
Dude.
But no,

12
00:00:35.971 --> 00:00:38.250
I'm not saying John.
Dude,
let's be very clear.

13
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.900
All I'm saying is he came out that statement and then uh,
he goes,

14
00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:47.250
he didn't snitch and then I was like,
wait,
what are the big Novitsky was like,
no.

15
00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:50.880
You said you're going to give us some info to help us out down the road with

16
00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:54.720
other people.
So you know,
I don't what,
yeah,

17
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.410
you saw that to released an official statement went,
hold on,
wait a minute.

18
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.290
Because Malik came out and was like,
no,
we never agreed,
so we're going to snitch.

19
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.310
And then you saw it.
I was like,
well,
well,
no,
remember really contract you sign.

20
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.890
Here's this section of the contract.

21
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.750
He said they would help them out in the future with other people.
I mean,

22
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.250
bring it up,
Jamie.
John John's world champion walking around wearing a wire.

23
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.340
Hey guys.
Hey,
can you just say work and got everyone else?

24
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.420
Anyone else just exhausted today are just so rich because your secret.

25
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.070
God,
anything Bro.
Why are you a full hoodie and sweatsuit in the sauna?

26
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.640
I don't.
You know,
I'm going to go out on a limb here.

27
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.740
I don't think that Jon cheated.
I don't need a,
you don't think you cheated?
No,

28
00:01:37.741 --> 00:01:41.130
I don't know.
I don't know.
It's very murky water.
I might be wrong.

29
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.400
I don't think he cheated.
I think he took something that was tainted.

30
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.970
I think that's why they're only giving them a year off and I think,
look,

31
00:01:47.971 --> 00:01:48.830
I'd set it on the pocket.

32
00:01:48.831 --> 00:01:52.050
You have any skeptical hippo eyes about how it's shortened sentence.

33
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.260
It's ready to go right around New York.
No,
right around this ESPN deal.

34
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.430
Monkey says there was none,

35
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.400
but I keep saying that and everybody keeps running with it.

36
00:02:02.401 --> 00:02:05.790
Substantial assistance doesn't necessarily mean it has to be on somebody else.

37
00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:07.710
It could have been on himself.
What?

38
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.340
So go up to the part that you've sought us session.

39
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.140
That's what you sought a released that statement.

40
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.310
I said there are two avenues above,
above antidoping policy,

41
00:02:16.311 --> 00:02:19.950
Lao for reduction of sanctions one individual and get a sanction reduction if he

42
00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:24.630
or she provides information that results in Usada or another antidoping agency

43
00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:29.631
bringing forward and anti-doping policy violation against other athletes or

44
00:02:29.971 --> 00:02:34.971
support personnel and or two or reduction can be given if the information

45
00:02:34.981 --> 00:02:37.680
results in a criminal or disciplinary body,

46
00:02:37.681 --> 00:02:42.660
bringing forward a criminal offense against individuals.
Importantly,

47
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.780
if the athlete or support personnel fails to continue to cooperate and provide

48
00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:50.200
credible substantial assistance,
you sought to,

49
00:02:50.201 --> 00:02:52.740
we'll reinstate the original sanction,

50
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.850
that snitching where I come from,
but I don't know.

51
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.970
Now I don't think John snitched on anyone to get a shorter sentence.

52
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.780
We'll find out if Jackson guys are popping left and right all of a sudden.

53
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:09.280
But I don't think John did that.
I think that's just in there.
Maybe or,

54
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.860
or if,
I don't know.
We,
we do not know.

55
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.590
And I like to give Jon Jones the benefit of the doubt.
And I will say this,

56
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.300
if I'm a UFC fighter,

57
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.620
I am hiring malty to be my goddamn manager because what he's done with John,

58
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.770
what he did with,
um,
fricking all his guys,
you what he did with,
uh,

59
00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:27.580
your boy Yoel Romero,
he goes to bat for them.

60
00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:30.450
No one else is fucking with the golden snitch like Malika does.
Yeah.

61
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.170
And everyone else kind of just goes,
ah,
fuck.
We got busted man.
Not Maliqi man.

62
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.160
That dude's going to the end of the earth.
The fight for your freedom.
Yeah.
He,

63
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.240
and it seems to know him that well,
I don't know him as a person,
you know,

64
00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:45.820
managers or managers,
but I'm saying if I'm the UFC,

65
00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:48.520
because they can't negotiate your sponsorship,
it's Reebok.

66
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.460
So what can they really do your contract and now you've got to deal with you.

67
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:55.720
Sato who is a huge deal Mackey's this fucking dog right now that you want in

68
00:03:55.721 --> 00:03:58.420
your back pocket.
And it's interesting that you saw that was just released.

69
00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:01.570
Like they released a statement that they're changing their policies.

70
00:04:01.571 --> 00:04:03.820
So say if you piss hot,
they don't.

71
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.840
And what's really interesting is Sean O'malley and right afterwards said,
Yo,

72
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.280
I pissed hot.
He said,
they don't want to announce people piss tot.
He goes,

73
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:14.530
I pissed hot.
He goes,
let me tell you something.

74
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.090
They're going to check my supplements.
And uh,
we think we've got it nailed.

75
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.160
We think we know what it is.
But in the meantime,

76
00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:23.140
this is why I was removed from this fight this weekend.

77
00:04:23.141 --> 00:04:25.540
So they're not going announce it.
There's going to pull you from the card.

78
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.820
They're just going to pull you from the card.
That ain't right.

79
00:04:27.821 --> 00:04:29.410
And they don't announce it.
I didn't write.

80
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.980
And then they go through the entire steps.

81
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.520
And then if you're exonerated,
you were never accused in the first place.

82
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.110
See the problem is,
is with,
is Sean O'malley,
whether whoever you are,

83
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.250
Travis Browne,
whoever name,
any fighter you want,
if you've ever been,

84
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.150
if it's even been hinted,
if you've ever had an issue,
um,

85
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.670
and you get that label,
nothing like people are just go,
he's on steroids.

86
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.500
They don't show big announcement going.

87
00:04:56.501 --> 00:04:59.920
Sorry we didn't find anything my bat we saw,
Hey Josh Barnett.

88
00:04:59.921 --> 00:05:03.920
So I had been out for 22 months my bat.
Right?
What the fuck man?
Right.

89
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.970
Give me some sort of compensation.
That's true also.

90
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.770
So it took you how long to figure this out.
I can't work during that time period.

91
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.510
And because of you I can't work and you made the mistake.

92
00:05:16.511 --> 00:05:20.920
How are we going to make this?
Right?
Oh I bet you can go fight now.
That's insane.

93
00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:24.550
Especially for Josh.
She's like 37.
He's not young or how about friends?

94
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.520
He's actually older than 37 Josh might be 40 yeah he's not,

95
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.730
he's long in the tooth.
He's been doing it for a hot minute.
Yeah,
I mean he was,

96
00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:32.650
but think of your John Jones though,
Dude.
Right?

97
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.380
Let's say he lets say you're right and he didn't do anything,

98
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.790
nothing on purpose and it was some bullshit supplement and he's been dragged

99
00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:42.520
through the mud up.
Rightfully so after hitting a woman pregnant,
all of that.

100
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.580
But with this,
that's a different thing.
That's a different thing with this,

101
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.990
you're like,
what the fuck man,
I could've fought Brock Lesnar.
I come doubled.

102
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.800
I can man live in dcs life.
But because of this I've been out,
I've been,

103
00:05:53.801 --> 00:05:58.100
my name has been tarnished forever.
Yeah,
but there was something in his urine.

104
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.110
There was a substance and that substance is a performance enhancing substance.

105
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.640
The real question is did it come like there's a lot of people that got it from

106
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:10.940
supplements.
I mean this is happening all throughout sports,

107
00:06:10.941 --> 00:06:12.320
but then there's people that say no,

108
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.170
they're saying that it happened from supplements,

109
00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:18.200
but really that's just an excuse for what p for them getting pop.

110
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.050
That's what most people,
yeah,
the majority side with that.

111
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.010
The problem in John's situation is that he tested negative and then he tested

112
00:06:25.011 --> 00:06:28.280
positive and he tested negative in a very short period of time,

113
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.120
which means that the amount that was in his system is a trace amount,

114
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.860
which is not anything that you could take that would impart performance

115
00:06:36.861 --> 00:06:37.694
enhancing benefits.

116
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.840
They said it like having a drop of steroids and a huge vat of water.

117
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.770
It's like an a benefit.
Now some people and not me,
man,
I'm,
I'm with you.

118
00:06:46.771 --> 00:06:49.580
I maybe he did take something that he wasn't supposed to,

119
00:06:49.581 --> 00:06:53.010
but I don't think it helped his performance.
But um,
some people say,

120
00:06:53.011 --> 00:06:55.940
oh well that he was micro dosing so it didn't get out of his system in time.

121
00:06:55.941 --> 00:06:58.220
That's why it's such small trace amount.
But at the time,

122
00:06:58.221 --> 00:07:01.280
if they would attest test and been a higher potency may be,

123
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.820
I don't think you can microdose this shit though.
I have no idea Joe.

124
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.640
I don't know.
But,
but listen,
they said he didn't do it.

125
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.300
Here's the shitty thing though.
Now dcs upset cause they're like,
hey DC,

126
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.180
we're going to strip you of one of your belts.
And John's going to fight for it,

127
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.810
but they haven't worked that out yet to try the Gustafson.

128
00:07:17.811 --> 00:07:21.270
Jon Jones situation is still hasn't been resolved yet.
Dang.
Dang.

129
00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.680
We're gonna find out this weekend.
Do you think we see how the card,
yeah,

130
00:07:24.681 --> 00:07:27.270
I think this weekend they'll have to announce they have to announce stuff

131
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.610
fucking month away,
man.
