1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.610
Racist Mom,
that was the,
that's like the label they get put on them,
right?
Yeah.

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:04.980
And then you know,

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.030
like that was the label that was put on the proud boys almost immediately.
Right.

4
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.120
Yet they're white supremacists.

5
00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:13.140
Even though there was people of color that were amongst the ranks and well they

6
00:00:13.141 --> 00:00:14.370
changed the definition of racist.

7
00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:17.830
Do you know what the whole origin of the proud boys is?
Yes.

8
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.580
It's kind of fucking hilarious.
Up.
Get up.
Go ahead Anthony Kumi.

9
00:00:22.581 --> 00:00:26.750
It told the whole story on this show because it happened with him and,

10
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.860
and Gavin McInnes that Gavin McInnes came up with it because of a guy that

11
00:00:32.251 --> 00:00:36.510
worked there and they were doing it as a goof and then it became a movement and

12
00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:38.910
then became like anybody can join in.
The people that joined,

13
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.920
they took it into a radical way and then it became looking to beat up antifa and

14
00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:48.190
it's just like,
fuck.
Well Gavin's crossed the line.
Yes.
That's,
you know,
there's,

15
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.260
and I'll point it out for your,
uh,
you mentioned media matters in a,
in a recent,

16
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.030
you know,
that you're talking about Alex Jones.

17
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.970
I wouldn't use them as a source for anything.
Well that's a good point.

18
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.140
But it was just clips of Alex talking.
It doesn't matter.
Uh,
they,
there's a,

19
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.430
there's a clip going round of Gavin McInnes where you can hear him saying these

20
00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:07.700
crazy things and you're like,
well,
he said it right.

21
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.950
But it turns out some of the clubs was talking about dogs.
They,
they,
you know,

22
00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:14.100
you really can't take the context out of things and these clips and understand

23
00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:18.540
that.
So what happens if I'm even afraid in my videos,

24
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.330
I don't quote people anymore because people have taken me reading a quote from a

25
00:01:22.331 --> 00:01:25.560
newspaper and attributed to me simply for reading someone else's quote.

26
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.700
And they say,
oh,
but he said it.
Right,
right.
I mean,
you look at the really,

27
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.970
the really funny instance of Count Dracula at the guy with the Nazi pug.

28
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.120
That is a hilarious story.
And they told him context didn't matter.

29
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.440
So when he leaves the courtroom,
the reporter says,
you said this phrase,

30
00:01:40.441 --> 00:01:43.980
which I'm not going to say,
and he says,
so did you,
if context doesn't matter,

31
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.710
right,
you should be arrested too.
But that's,
you know,
so,

32
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.680
so what ends up happening is these activist groups,

33
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.560
they take these quotes out of context,
but,
but admittedly,

34
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:55.380
I think it's fair to point out a lot of people recognize Gavin,

35
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.720
if you can assume there were jokes or not,
doesn't matter.

36
00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:01.430
He said things that were over the,
over the line.
Well,
Gavin's the main problem,

37
00:02:01.431 --> 00:02:04.650
the indefensible problem was the call to violence,
right?
The calling,

38
00:02:04.651 --> 00:02:08.900
calling for violence.
And I don't think Gavin's like,
he's another one.

39
00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:11.790
He's like a prankster.
He's like a punk rock style prankster.

40
00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:14.430
And he likes to burn it to the ground.
Yep.
And look,

41
00:02:14.431 --> 00:02:17.790
I'm a fan of Gavin's interviews on youtube where he'll,

42
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.090
he hoodwinks people and to sitting down and talking to him,

43
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.590
or I don't even know if they're still up anymore,

44
00:02:22.591 --> 00:02:24.870
but my understanding is he ruined some checks.
Life.

45
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.550
I mean this like somewhat figuratively,
she was a,
a left wing individual.

46
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.260
He didn't know who he was.

47
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.830
He asked her to come on and her friends basically just disavowed her immediately

48
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.750
because she was talking to him because she sounded an unintelligent,
oh,

49
00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:41.910
I gotta you.
Gotta I gotta tell you,
man,
he cornered her.

50
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.900
I don't know if you have this issue,
but for the longest time it's,
it's,

51
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.520
it's substantially harder to interview someone on the ideological left than

52
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.010
anyone else.
Right.
So I recently reached out to,
you know,

53
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.320
I regularly reach out to people.
I don't,

54
00:02:56.321 --> 00:02:59.440
I'm not going to name drop cause I don't want to drag people,
but a man,

55
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:02.030
it takes weeks trying to organize a meeting with some,
you know,

56
00:03:02.031 --> 00:03:06.550
these personalities who are progressive and on the left.
Yup.
Uh,

57
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.390
even even people who,
like I,
I've gotten messages from people saying,
yeah man,

58
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:12.610
I watch yourself stuff all the time,
but hold on,
let me,
let me think about it.

59
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:13.780
And talked to some people first.

60
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.090
And I'm not saying they're doing it because they're,
you know,

61
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.880
skittish or it's just harder.
It's a lot harder.
Well,

62
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:22.510
they're probably more cautious,
especially if you know your,

63
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.490
where your ideology,
Stan is ambiguous.
It's trying to figure it out.
Oh yeah.
If,

64
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.670
if you're,
if you're,
you know,
a man,
even,
even Dave and pat,
David Pakman,

65
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.490
Jimmy Dore get get dragged through this sometimes.

66
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.630
I see the people on Twitter calling them all to write the weirdly enough or

67
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.960
intellectual dark web Jimmy Doors.
An interesting character.

68
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:44.170
I really liked our car.
Yeah,
I think he's such an interesting guy.

69
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.360
He's very smart,
but he's,
he's like,
oh,
he's an angry lefty,
but you know,

70
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.870
but he defends free speech.
He defines question and he's 100% here.

71
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.680
Here's my thing,
man.
I was in Berkeley,

72
00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.190
it was this big protest against Ben Shapiro and there's a guy wearing a mask

73
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:03.790
with a,
you know,
communist flag full like rent gear.

74
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.730
So I got to interview him and I'm like,
you mind if I interview?
He was like,
yeah,

75
00:04:06.731 --> 00:04:09.190
yeah,
of course.
And I was like,
really?
Oh,
that's surprising.

76
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.780
And then we started talking and I said,

77
00:04:10.781 --> 00:04:13.480
how do you feel about these people that dress in all black and you know,
are,

78
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:16.730
are fighting people and causing problems?
Oh,
that's terrible.
I was like,
Eh,

79
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.700
you think so?
Really?
It's actually,

80
00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:21.600
I'm surprised because often when I see people wearing,
you know,

81
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.350
fully masked up with communist stuff,

82
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.770
they're typically in favor of the by any means,

83
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.730
by any means necessary strategies.
And he was like,
no way,
man,
that's wrong.

84
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.430
And so I'm like,
you know what man,
I don't care if you're communist,

85
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:34.810
I don't care if you're whatever,

86
00:04:34.811 --> 00:04:38.020
as long as not an authoritarian who thinks you have the right to beat other

87
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:43.021
people to instill your ideology on them or use manipulative force or coercion or

88
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.210
extortion like,
so let me,
let me,
let me,

89
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.210
let me talk about why I think what we're seeing with Twitter might be one of the

90
00:04:49.211 --> 00:04:51.910
biggest problems ever.
Twitter,
Youtube,
Facebook.

91
00:04:51.911 --> 00:04:55.540
These platforms are where we exist socially,
politically.

92
00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.340
It's where our ideas are exchanged.

93
00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.190
It's where we learn about who we are going to vote for or why we won't vote for

94
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:02.710
somebody.
When you band somebody,
you exile them.

95
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.390
They're no longer a part of that conversation.

96
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.370
So they're very much so told you are outside the city walls,
right?

97
00:05:09.371 --> 00:05:11.560
You can't come and you can't talk to us and there's nothing you can do about it.

98
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.950
But then when you realize the rules are actually bent,

99
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.410
you know they're slanted in a certain direction,

100
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.700
you can then predict where things are going.
