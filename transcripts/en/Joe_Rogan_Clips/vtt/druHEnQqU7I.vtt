00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.560
People who don't know what violence is.
It's like,
here's one that people say.

2
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.220
They'll say to a martial arts person,
like they'll see someone like a John Jones.

3
00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:11.550
Like if I was John Jones,
I just fucking kick everybody's ass.
Like,
no,

4
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:13.830
you wouldn't.
No,
you wouldn't.
Okay.

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.440
Do you know and all the problems that Jon Jones has been in,

6
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:18.810
one thing you should notice is never been in a fight.

7
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.750
There's no street fights out there with John Jones.
You know what I mean?

8
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.500
I would bet he has least the least likely person to engage in that activity.

9
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.790
I bet you're right.
Yeah,

10
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.250
because he doesn't want to do because he knows exactly the consequences,

11
00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:32.730
let alone the legal consequences of doing it outside of a cage.
Exactly.

12
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.210
But when you look at it from someone who has zero understanding,
they're like,
oh,

13
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:39.630
if I was that guy,
be kicking everybody's ass.
But no,
you wouldn't.

14
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.960
Because like violence,
people don't just accept violence.

15
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.400
You don't just hit someone and get away with it.

16
00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:48.270
They think about that shit forever and they try to get you back and either hire

17
00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:51.510
someone to get you back or they get you back on their own or they wait for you

18
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:53.430
to not remember it and then they,

19
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.400
they come around the corner and fucking brainy with a baseball bat.

20
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.670
This is what people do.
People don't like getting fucked up.

21
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.440
If you kick someone's ass,
they're going to remember it.
They're going to,

22
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.170
and this idea that you're going to be able to suppress people buy by attacking

23
00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:09.600
them and hitting them with bike locks and you know,

24
00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:13.140
and not letting them speak at universities that,
you know,
you're,
you're,

25
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.780
you're protesting at,
it's,
it's madness and it's,
it's,

26
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.090
it's so confusing because it's not indicative of what I always thought of when I

27
00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:22.290
thought about left wing people.

28
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.490
I thought there were peace loving people or well educated and instead you're

29
00:01:26.491 --> 00:01:29.520
getting these people that are from their fucking computer,

30
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.850
they're calling for violence.
Like you don't know what violence is.

31
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.880
One of the thing is too,
from what I've seen,
it didn't start with the bike locks,

32
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:36.930
right?
It started with,
you know,

33
00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:40.410
shout this person down and then it's like fist fights and then they're throwing

34
00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:43.710
rocks and then it's bike locks and now I hear people,
you know,

35
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.510
get your guns and it starts to rise to that level.
I'm like,
okay,
yeah,

36
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.720
you people need to calm down because the theory of it,

37
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.750
we need a revolution in this country.
Like let's pump the brakes,
homeboy.

38
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.240
Well first of all,
here's what we need.
We need camaraderie.
We need to be nice.

39
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.150
This is more important than anything.
We need to be calm with each other.

40
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.320
You know this,
this idea that yelling people down stops anything.

41
00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:13.230
You're just going to make people yell louder on the other side that that shit

42
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:15.750
does not work.
That's not how human beings operate.

43
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.080
When if you want human beings to appreciate your perspective,

44
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.650
find the things that you agree on and work towards a better humanity.

45
00:02:25.261 --> 00:02:29.670
Work towards a better,
more loving way of interacting with each other.

46
00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:33.450
This is possible while disagreeing and this is one of the most important things

47
00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:37.170
I think that we could ever express in terms of how to communicate with each

48
00:02:37.171 --> 00:02:37.920
other.

49
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.780
You don't have to shout people down like the the best way to do it is to try to

50
00:02:42.781 --> 00:02:45.180
figure out the points that you can agree on,

51
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.750
find out what you disagree on and find out why you disagree on it and you're

52
00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:50.310
always going to get bad actors.
Right?

53
00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:54.150
You're always going to get people that are in there that they don't care.

54
00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:54.961
They're not reasonable,

55
00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:59.530
they just want to win and well then there's a giant problem with that kind of

56
00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:03.840
communicating because it's so absolute.
It's my way or the highway like that's,

57
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.370
that's where violence comes from.
That's where that's where real.
Yeah.

58
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.210
That's where real physical conflicts,
that's where they come from.

59
00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:13.020
When there's no way to negotiate.
There's no way to communicate outside of that.

60
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.840
<v 1>I just think it's,
I dunno,
bizarre is not the right word.</v>

61
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:21.160
I think it's sad that the vast majority from,
again,
my opinion,

62
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:23.650
what I see is people who are identifying with shit.

63
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:27.130
You can see on the street sign.
Yeah.
Like left or right,
right,
right.

64
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.130
You're telling me that as a species,
that's his nuances.

65
00:03:30.131 --> 00:03:34.210
We can get you want to completely define yourself and your ideology and your

66
00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:37.660
beliefs by something literally you can see just driving your car,
turn left,

67
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.930
turn right.
It's just,
I don't understand it.
I don't,
um,

68
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.810
it's the exact opposite world to go back to,
you know,

69
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:46.850
getting out of the military and,
and,

70
00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:49.260
and just kind of entering into the world and like what's going on.
Yeah.

71
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.240
Makes no sense to me.
It makes me extremely uncomfortable.

72
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.700
I hate hearing people calling for violence.
Um,

73
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.660
<v 0>I know,
and especially calling for violence when it's not necessary against the</v>

74
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:00.840
Americans.
When you,

75
00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:05.841
what you had to deal with in the military has to be the most intense form of,

76
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.930
of conflict that's available on planet earth.

77
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.400
The most intense form of conflict is war.
That's the real conflict.

78
00:04:14.401 --> 00:04:17.370
That's real consequences.
You've suffered them physically.

79
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.060
You've seen countless friends saw for them physically.
That's the real shit.

80
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:25.800
So when you seeing people from universities from these coddled environments and

81
00:04:25.801 --> 00:04:26.634
these,
these,

82
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.260
these people with it really an completely ignorant perspective as the,

83
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.860
as to what the actual consequences of violence are calling for it.

84
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.270
It's just bananas.

85
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.260
<v 1>On one hand,</v>

86
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.790
I'm glad that they haven't experienced it because I can tell that they haven't,

87
00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:45.610
just by the way that they're acting and I'm glad that they didn't have to do

88
00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:48.490
that.
But on the other one,
it's a tough pill to swallow because

89
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.460
I just don't unders war war is a,
uh,

90
00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.950
it's about as high consequence as you can get for sure.
Like I said,

91
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:01.750
it resets your,
it resets your perspective.

92
00:05:01.751 --> 00:05:06.550
And the last thing that I would ever want to see is that here on the streets of

93
00:05:06.551 --> 00:05:11.420
the u s like I,
I just,
I can't even imagine how destructive,
well,

94
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.650
it would just,
it would destroy our country for sure.
But I also don't,

95
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.740
I can't figure out and the route out of where we are.

96
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.180
So people are calling for violence,
right?

97
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.710
It got other countries trying to incite a get groups together.
Like,

98
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.580
what's the navigatable route out of that?
Mushrooms

99
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.460
<v 0>hadn't considered that route.
I don't,
I honestly don't know.
Um,</v>

100
00:05:33.461 --> 00:05:35.560
I'm hoping that things don't have to come to a head.

101
00:05:35.561 --> 00:05:38.320
I'm hoping that we don't have a Kent state or some,

102
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.310
some horrible event in this country were,
you know,
protesters and,

103
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.950
and the people that oppose them get into some horrible deadly violent encounter

104
00:05:48.461 --> 00:05:52.500
cause so far other than Charlottesville,
that time that guy ran over,
uh,

105
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:53.830
the woman in the car,

106
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.460
we're seeing most of this violence being at least somewhat contained to

107
00:05:58.461 --> 00:06:00.710
fisticuffs.
Right.
And you know,
the,

108
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:04.160
the professor to hit that guy with a bike lock and there's a few other instances

109
00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:06.470
of people get knocked out and punched and hit with sticks.

110
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.130
We haven't seen mass shootings and murder,
but God dammit,

111
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.530
<v 1>that Shit's close.
Especially when they're doing rallies and people are like,</v>

112
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.960
you know,
yeah,
let's do an open carry rally.

113
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:21.950
And everybody show up in their operators sheikh apparel with,

114
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.120
I look at the pictures of that.
I'm like,
okay,
you have a lot of stuff.
First off,

115
00:06:26.121 --> 00:06:29.630
that's on fucking backwards.
You know,
like I'm looking,
I'm like,
okay,

116
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.450
you have all the tools,
but you obviously don't practice with them.

117
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.590
But the danger of just,
you know,
what's the next step?
First,
we're just gonna,

118
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.360
you know,
we're going to where?
All of our stuff.
All right.

119
00:06:38.361 --> 00:06:42.110
Well if it started at fist and then when bike locks and then when show up with

120
00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:47.030
your civil war gear,
right.
What's the next step after that shooting?
Yeah.

121
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.380
Yeah.
I mean,
I don't know.
I don't want to get involved in that.
I mean,
I,

122
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.390
well you picked a good spot where you're at in Montana.

123
00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.340
Where I live does not suck.

124
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.520
<v 0>Yeah.
Hang out there and move in.</v>

125
00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:05.270
Once the first few rounds have been fired,
the dust starts to settle.
I just,

126
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.580
<v 1>the problem is I would want to come off the bench.
Of course,</v>

127
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.000
the problem is if that happens and I'm not,

128
00:07:11.001 --> 00:07:13.130
I guarantee you I'm not the only one that feels like that.

129
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.340
I'm going to get involved and it's going to be a serious problem for those

130
00:07:16.341 --> 00:07:20.620
individuals because,
uh,
I'd give my military career,

131
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.130
see across the board average,

132
00:07:22.131 --> 00:07:25.640
there's absolutely nothing spectacular about my career.

133
00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:27.590
I had done more than some way less than others,

134
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.870
but I've sacrificed enough that I'm not gonna allow those people to tear us

135
00:07:32.871 --> 00:07:35.660
apart.
But it's the last thing on earth that I want to do.

136
00:07:35.661 --> 00:07:36.800
But they put me in that position.

137
00:07:36.801 --> 00:07:39.530
I know that myself and many other people are in that same boat are going to get

138
00:07:39.531 --> 00:07:42.050
involved.
And that's,
I don't know if that's going to help the problem,

139
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.480
but it's going to get ugly pretty fast.

140
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:50.590
<v 0>Remember a time where the country spins so divided in terms of,</v>

141
00:07:50.891 --> 00:07:51.131
I mean,

142
00:07:51.131 --> 00:07:55.360
I don't know whether it's because of social media and because of the Russian

143
00:07:55.361 --> 00:07:59.650
influence on social media compounded with having Trump as a president,

144
00:07:59.651 --> 00:08:03.270
compounded with,
I mean,
people that feel like they're disenfranchised and they,

145
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.530
they don't feel like they're like,
you know,

146
00:08:05.531 --> 00:08:09.910
you hear about this all the time in regards to income inequality.

147
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.270
People feel disenfranchised.
They feel like the system has failed them.

148
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:17.650
And that's why so many young kids are favoring socialism and why so many young

149
00:08:17.651 --> 00:08:19.120
kids are moving towards that.

150
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:23.590
They think that anything has gotta be better than watching these fat rich cats

151
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:25.600
with all this money controlling the world.

152
00:08:25.601 --> 00:08:29.470
And that the only way to get out of that as revolution,
but damn,
you're,
you know,

153
00:08:29.471 --> 00:08:33.010
like there's a lot of people that are not those fat rich cats.

154
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:36.610
You're positioning yourself against it or just normal regular Americans who

155
00:08:36.611 --> 00:08:38.630
happen to be conservative,
you know,

156
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.610
in conservative does not always have to equal racist.

157
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.190
It doesn't always have to equal white supremacy.

158
00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:48.820
It doesn't always have to equal all the negative connotations.
You know,

159
00:08:48.821 --> 00:08:52.900
religious fanaticism and all these different things that people always attach

160
00:08:52.901 --> 00:08:56.480
towards conservatism.
It doesn't have to mean that it couldn't,

161
00:08:56.481 --> 00:09:00.570
it could just mean people who are a prudent with their finances,
who are,

162
00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:03.270
you know,
they're,
they're cautious with the way they think.

163
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:07.230
They're more conservative in their values and their ideals.
This is,

164
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.110
that's not a bad thing necessarily,

165
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:13.860
but we've got it lumped into these two groups left versus right.

166
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.900
And there's a very little gray area,
but it's the tyranny of,
or you know,

167
00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:22.800
it's like it's as if there's only two choices.
You're either left or right.

168
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.390
Yeah.
Like where's the end?
Where's you trend to the left?

169
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:30.360
And you also have some values that are associated with the right,

170
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.730
or you're trending at that.
It's a.
