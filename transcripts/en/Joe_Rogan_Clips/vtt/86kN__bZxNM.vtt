1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.400
Her low freak bitches on his own shit,
you know,
but in any ways.

2
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.060
So we're having these arguments and then it would turn to a pejorative and I'm

3
00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:12.390
like,
well,
okay,
why are you attacking me?
I'm not attacking you.

4
00:00:12.391 --> 00:00:16.480
I'm not even being angry about your statement.
I just,
you,
you,

5
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.500
you made statement a so I don't believe in it.
I don't,

6
00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:21.900
I don't think that that's correct.
So we're having a discussion,

7
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.860
but now it became a,
a personal attack.

8
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.250
Not once even gets to that,
let alone someone,
even back in the day talking about,

9
00:00:30.251 --> 00:00:34.080
oh,
it really upsets me that uh,
no matter how angry you know,
my,
whatever,

10
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.340
if I hit you or did this,
it wouldn't matter because you're you.
It's like,
well,

11
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.940
both of these statements come from the same,

12
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.240
same with both of those scenarios come from the same place.
It's like,

13
00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:47.970
well now you're trying,
you're attacking me,
the individual.

14
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.740
Because if you're going to do that,

15
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.660
you aren't thinking about me as the person that's,
no,
no,
no.

16
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.290
I got your back through heaven and hell,

17
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.320
I will kick the gates of hell down and kill everyone there.

18
00:00:58.321 --> 00:01:01.750
If I got to the four year,
they're there.

19
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.550
They want to devalue a,
they want to devalue me,
the person,

20
00:01:05.551 --> 00:01:09.480
because they,
they feel attacked in some way.
They feel like they're,

21
00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:13.050
they're so attached to their,
to their statement,
to whatever that may be,

22
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.430
which has some attachment to maybe what they feel is their existence.

23
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.480
That to re to change that is dangerous.

24
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.040
To haul it outright wrong would be an even bigger problem.
And I mean,
you know,

25
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.490
I,
it's just like this stuff would start showing up at the house.
And so I'm like,

26
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:29.881
all right,

27
00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:32.640
I'm going to start doing research on marks and angles and all this different

28
00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:33.131
stuff.
And,

29
00:01:33.131 --> 00:01:36.240
and then as I would go further and further and further down the rabbit hole,

30
00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:37.620
I come back and I go,
oh,
okay.

31
00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:40.740
So this argument stems from this and this and this and this and this.

32
00:01:40.741 --> 00:01:44.570
And they're like,
no,
it doesn't like,
whoa.
Okay.
Uh,
why,

33
00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:46.490
why do you think people operate?
Like,
what,

34
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.270
what do you think their whole reasoning is?
You know,

35
00:01:48.271 --> 00:01:51.180
we get in these arguments about capitalism.
Capitalism is a neutral system.

36
00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:51.571
Ask you this.

37
00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:55.890
What is it about social justice warriors are left wing people that were Marxism

38
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.160
is so attractive to them.
Uh,
well for one it's,

39
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.930
it's this idea of equity,
like this sameness.
Like everybody,

40
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.610
nobody is being left behind and no one is,
is becoming greater than anybody else.

41
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.850
Uh,
it's also the idea,
I like to think of it in,

42
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I think a lot of these young people look at it as grow mom's house,

43
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.680
mom and dad's house.
So when you're a mom and dad's house,

44
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.980
someone does your laundry.
Someone who cooks your food,
you know,

45
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:26.310
you always just show up.
You got a place to live,
uh,
you know,

46
00:02:26.311 --> 00:02:30.390
the TV turns on and then the government should become mom and dad wants.
Exactly.

47
00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:33.450
So they want mom and dad's house to exist forever.

48
00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:36.720
So it's just like they can run off and do whatever it is they want to do.
Food.

49
00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:39.750
There's plenty of money for shelter.
We just need to spend it.
Right.

50
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.330
The redistribution of wealth.
Right,
exactly.

51
00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:47.331
Because if you exceed that system more than they deem that you should have,

52
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.220
then you should give it to somebody else and it's like,
well,

53
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.440
how do you think I got this?
Oh my God,
I'm sorry to interrupt you.
Go ahead.

54
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.140
Keep going.
It's just like,
how do you think I got this?
Uh,
people can say,
well,

55
00:02:58.141 --> 00:03:01.570
it was you got it through you and inherited it.
Okay.
That does happen.

56
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.100
I could also have got it through hard work and dedication and some,

57
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.510
some guile and some smarts and made it happen for myself.

58
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.380
Does that somehow mean that I had to do it at the expense of someone else?

59
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.660
Not necessarily shitty argument.
Right.
That's the,

60
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:19.180
but that's the argument that they keep pressing is that if you're successful,

61
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:22.900
you did it on the bits.
All grant.
It's all grift.
Yeah.
What do you think?

62
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.860
This is what I wanted to ask from someone else is an interesting thing too.

63
00:03:26.861 --> 00:03:29.290
It's like if someone agrees to do a job,

64
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.060
if their skillset is limited in such a way that they were,

65
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.860
that they were capable of doing this job at this moment.

66
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.130
Now of course if you're asking me,

67
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.650
they probably they have a potential to do more than that.

68
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.430
As long as they're willing to invest back in themselves and find another skill

69
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:47.120
or expand that skill,
you know,

70
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.310
if there's always possibility for growth within a human being,

71
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.840
within their lot in life,

72
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:56.470
whatever that is and that that could be transferred into work could be

73
00:03:56.471 --> 00:03:58.390
transferred into a personal goals.

74
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.940
I mean it's all about how you value things also.

75
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.930
So this person gets into this job working,

76
00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:07.540
making widgets for this guy who invented this widget.

77
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.110
This guy invented the widget,
the argument that,
okay,

78
00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:13.840
the worker deserves just as much as the guy that invented it.
It's like,

79
00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:17.830
well hold on.
Without the guy that invented the widget,
you have no job.

80
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.920
Like all of these people that are working out on working underneath them,

81
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.190
we'd have nothing.
They would have zero,
there would be no widget to build.

82
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.380
And the guy that made the widget also has the most responsibility because he had

83
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:32.980
to come up with the money to produce the widget to be able to hire the people to

84
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:33.814
make the widget,

85
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.510
to then market the widget to do all these things to the widget to get it out

86
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:42.511
there to make it successful enough to then support more people and that doesn't

87
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:45.340
necessarily mean it's on the back of that other person.

88
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.690
Because you could also say,

89
00:04:46.691 --> 00:04:49.660
well is everything on the back of the guy that made the widget?

90
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.320
I mean do you just,
his idea is not worth it is not,

91
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.630
can't be belonged to him because he created it.
We we,

92
00:04:56.631 --> 00:04:59.590
we should take it for us even though we never,
we did not come up with it.

93
00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:00.460
We never created it.

94
00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:04.060
We didn't even have the facilities to make any created and didn't invent it are

95
00:05:04.061 --> 00:05:07.540
the ones who want to define how much this guy should get for inventing it versus

96
00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:11.140
how much they are.
And I would get into arguments with my ex about,
she's like,
oh,

97
00:05:11.141 --> 00:05:14.020
I think all businesses should be co ops and my finger.
Like what does that mean?

98
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.860
Well like cooperative where everybody is getting an equal share and end into the

99
00:05:17.861 --> 00:05:21.610
business itself.
Yeah,
I would say it is hilarious.

100
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.730
And also because I would say all businesses can be co ops.

101
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.640
There is no one's stopping a business from being a co op.

102
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.670
We know what stops businesses from being a co op is somebody doesn't want it to

103
00:05:30.671 --> 00:05:34.210
be a co op or a,
someone decides,
well that doesn't,

104
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.680
I can't do it that way.

105
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.390
So it won't make as much sense for me to create a co op situation as it would to

106
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.070
not or a co op sounds nice and enforced.
Co-Op does not sound nice.
Of course.

107
00:05:45.071 --> 00:05:48.130
Clop sounds nice if like say if you and I live on a block and we said,
hey,
let's,

108
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.160
we've got this fucking patch of land.

109
00:05:50.161 --> 00:05:53.230
Let's start a garden started a little small farm.
Correct.

110
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.140
And we'll just have a little co op here.
Right.
All right,
cool.
Great.
Yeah.

111
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.690
Beautiful.
But that's not my choice.
Voluntary and says Josh Barnett,

112
00:05:59.691 --> 00:06:01.370
is this the Josh Barnett Farm?
Yeah.
Well,

113
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:03.170
you're going to have to turn this into a co op and you're like,

114
00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:06.320
what the fuck I am.
Well,
we're going to put you in jail.
Exactly.
And that's,

115
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.510
and then it comes back down to violence.
Here's the question.

116
00:06:08.511 --> 00:06:12.560
This is what I kept meaning to ask before I forget.
Do you think that the,

117
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.180
what do you think the numbers are of the people that are involved in these ideas

118
00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:20.430
that have never competed in anything?
Now that's,

119
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:26.580
my ex girlfriend is a professional fighter.
She fights and Bella tour.
However,

120
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.800
the idea of the meritocracy,
of being a fighter,
it seems,

121
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.970
it's not,
I don't think it's lost on her.
I just think that she,

122
00:06:34.971 --> 00:06:39.971
she doesn't like the way it's worked out for her and that makes her an upset.

123
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:45.180
Whereas for me,
I found success as being a fighter.

124
00:06:45.181 --> 00:06:47.280
And it sometimes it would,
it would appear that she would be,

125
00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:52.640
she would be upset at me for what I was able to do and somehow think that maybe

126
00:06:52.801 --> 00:06:57.390
I was less deserving or somehow,
um,
it's an exception that who knows what,

127
00:06:57.391 --> 00:07:00.060
but the reality is,
is like I can sit back and go,
oh,

128
00:07:00.061 --> 00:07:02.280
Mark Hunt just made $800,000.

129
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.070
Her thought might,
it might be more,
let's say if we're just,
I'm making this up.

130
00:07:08.071 --> 00:07:10.590
I'm not saying it.
She said this,
you know,
she's like,
well,

131
00:07:10.591 --> 00:07:12.360
why does he deserve $800,000?

132
00:07:12.361 --> 00:07:17.280
Why I make a $4,000 or $5,000 or whatever?
Seeing people say that,

133
00:07:17.281 --> 00:07:21.310
right?
It's just like,
okay,
well I could think of all plenty of reasons and go,

134
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:25.560
he draws more tickets.
He's got a better record.
He's,
he's one,

135
00:07:25.561 --> 00:07:29.010
he's a k one she champ or whatever,
you know,
at the end of the day,

136
00:07:29.011 --> 00:07:33.600
if any in New Zealand.
Right.
And if he's selling more tickets than you are,

137
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.830
then he gives it,
he deserves a greater percentage of that money now.

138
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.980
Now you come to me and I can be like,
well,
I beat Mark Hunt.
Right?

139
00:07:40.981 --> 00:07:44.460
But what's her argument for that when you say that?
Uh,

140
00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.710
her argument for that would be that,
you know,

141
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.920
this other person isn't any more deserving than,

142
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.680
so everyone should get paid the same.
So Jon Jones,
Fides,
Daniel Cormier,
Yay.

143
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.680
Huge fight.
Everybody on the undercard gets a fair share.

144
00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.920
Well either that or just like,
well,
I deserve more than this and it's,

145
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:03.820
and my argument would always be [inaudible] when she was upset about what she

146
00:08:03.821 --> 00:08:06.520
may be getting paid here or there and some of this,
I'd go,
we'll look,
you know,

147
00:08:06.521 --> 00:08:10.690
for,
for this,
for what we're trying to accomplish and for what,

148
00:08:10.691 --> 00:08:15.370
what is available in these markets.
That's not a bad payday.

149
00:08:15.371 --> 00:08:18.130
Well that sucks.
No,
I agree with you.
You should make more money,

150
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.740
but we can't and it's not available.

151
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.980
So we have to deal with what we have for me.

152
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.560
And then I would look at something like Mark Hunt and be like,
well,

153
00:08:26.561 --> 00:08:27.850
I beat Mark Hunt,
but so what?

154
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:33.190
I'm more glad that Mark Hunt was able to create an opportunity to make $800,000

155
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.091
so therefore,

156
00:08:34.091 --> 00:08:37.510
if he can make $800,000 now the potential for me do that exists as well.

157
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.960
And it's just similar to like the old Gina Carano thing where everyone got on a

158
00:08:40.961 --> 00:08:43.750
train about wanting to be Gina Carano fucked tuna crunch,
not even that good,

159
00:08:43.751 --> 00:08:46.090
and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
All this hate at Gina Carano.

160
00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.240
When the reality is like,
okay,
well even if you beat Gina Carano,

161
00:08:49.241 --> 00:08:51.910
you're not going to get what Gina Carano gets.
You're not going to get,

162
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.220
people aren't going to like you just as much or more.

163
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.600
It's really not about any of that.
The only thing you can control is yourself.

164
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.900
At the end of the day,
you can only control yourself.
You can,

165
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:05.760
you only you can can work to try and increase or you're in determine your value

166
00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:07.140
in terms of what you're trying to sell.

167
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:17.050
<v 1>Okay.</v>
