1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.230
In an argument with someone about the wage gap.
Yeah.

2
00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.490
They really believed that men and women work right next to each other doing the

3
00:00:06.491 --> 00:00:07.151
same job.

4
00:00:07.151 --> 00:00:10.600
And the woman is only making 75 cents to the guys dollar that's been put out

5
00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:12.850
there in no time.
This is a crazy thing to argue.

6
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.360
Like if you're going to argue that you should know what that is,

7
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.160
<v 1>you should know what that is.
Otherwise you're just talking shit like,
yeah,</v>

8
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.880
which we all do sometimes.
But you gotta be willing to say,

9
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.780
I didn't really know which studies have you read.

10
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.110
And it's almost always zero studies.

11
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.030
I like to believe this versus whatever.
Luckily,

12
00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:33.640
we're not in charge of making decisions.
People Love,

13
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.360
love to put these studies out.
Uh,

14
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.290
he like to tweet them out without having even looked at them at all.
Yeah,
it's,

15
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.130
some of these are there.
So there's studies out there that prove you everything.

16
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.290
Wage gap.
He was like,
so you're telling me I can get the same?
Look,

17
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.390
I'm a smart businessman who's made a bunch of money and I can get the same level

18
00:00:51.391 --> 00:00:56.010
of talent out of this woman or better,
well let's just say equal,

19
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.130
but 75% or better,
sorry ma'am,
sorry,

20
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.160
or or equal or probably better,
uh,

21
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.290
95 cents on the dollar and I'm a smart businessman and I'm not going to go with

22
00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:11.940
the lower costs,
equal talent,
better talent.
That's,

23
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.940
that's how can I run a successful business?
Making that kind of decision.

24
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.570
How can you,
yeah,
it would just,

25
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.490
they would be hired at far higher rights or you can look deeper at it and be

26
00:01:20.491 --> 00:01:23.210
like,
oh,
it's just like total jobs or whatever it is.
Okay.

27
00:01:23.211 --> 00:01:26.850
And I haven't raised studies,
but I just listened to people who've have,

28
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.210
<v 0>I think you're right.
I think there's something to that.</v>

29
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.570
If they're really could hire the same people for the same job and get a woman

30
00:01:34.571 --> 00:01:37.000
who's just as good at it for 75 cents,
it's horse shit though.

31
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.710
They would all join it.
Hire only women.

32
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.210
The people don't know what we're talking about.

33
00:01:40.211 --> 00:01:43.150
It's all based on what jobs you choose.
It's like,

34
00:01:43.151 --> 00:01:46.660
it's not that men don't make more money because they do the same job and make

35
00:01:46.661 --> 00:01:49.510
more money at that job and the woman does,
they do different jobs.

36
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.040
That's where the wage gap is.

37
00:01:51.041 --> 00:01:53.770
The wage gap is in the number of hours that men work,

38
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.360
the different jobs that they choose,
what they excel in.
It's,

39
00:01:57.361 --> 00:02:00.950
it has nothing to do with like two people that are both,
you know,

40
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.760
in the same line on a,

41
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.620
on an assembly line or something like that with the same amount of time and they

42
00:02:05.621 --> 00:02:10.621
both make the same amount of money and one or rather the male makes a dollar a

43
00:02:10.691 --> 00:02:14.350
dollar for every 75 cents.
That's not how the wage cap works.

44
00:02:14.351 --> 00:02:15.310
It's just different jobs.

45
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.770
<v 1>Okay.
So hearing that information,
like I remember when I first heard it,</v>

46
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.260
it was like,
you can either go,
fuck you,

47
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.160
you're just trying to fucking shit on women or you can go,
Huh,
well let me,

48
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.120
I've never thought of that.

49
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.940
Let me look into that a little bit and then I'll get back to you instead of

50
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.690
immediately reacting.
Fuck off.
Well,
people get mad like that's not what it is.

51
00:02:31.691 --> 00:02:34.410
Like,
yes,
it is what?
It is foolish if you keep arguing with

52
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.950
<v 0>me because you don't even know what it is.
This is a dumb conversation now.</v>

53
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.880
I can't argue with you when I know that you haven't read any of the stuff that

54
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.820
points to these numbers.
Like,
look,

55
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.280
the thing is no one should be like whatever you do,

56
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.390
whatever it is,

57
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.630
whether it is you make incredible sculptures or you build cars,

58
00:02:56.731 --> 00:02:59.500
oh,
you're a painter.
Whatever the fuck it is that you do.

59
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.010
No one should be able to say that you doing this definitely should make as much

60
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:09.150
money as doing that.
No things are worth.

61
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.580
<v 1>Yeah,
exactly.
Bowler.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

62
00:03:13.581 --> 00:03:18.470
At some point he was rights to,
I think top 15 in the world at his sport,

63
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.860
which is the equivalent of like a,

64
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.020
I'm trying to even think who would be like Carmelo Anthony and this Guy Tom and

65
00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:29.750
dilutes at his sport made 38 grand and,

66
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.070
and fucking and,
and Carmela makes you know 20 million.
Yeah.
Sorry.

67
00:03:35.071 --> 00:03:38.110
Your sports not as popular.
It's just not as popular way classes in his popular,

68
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.700
whatever.
Hell it works.
Yeah.
That's just how it was not fucking assault after.

69
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.600
Yeah.
I could see how you would want more money.
Yeah,
sure.
Everybody does.

70
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.190
I get that.
But like

71
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.060
<v 0>there's certain people that they're just,
it's a harder do that job.</v>

72
00:03:51.061 --> 00:03:54.600
And the reason why they do it is because they know that it's more valuable.

73
00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:56.430
So they work hard.
Definitely.
They get that job.

74
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.240
Imagine being the fucking CEO of a corporation.

75
00:04:00.241 --> 00:04:05.241
How much pressure would be on you all the time being fucking Tim Cook over at

76
00:04:06.571 --> 00:04:11.230
Apple.
Ah,
that's right.
I don't get paid as much as him.
Exactly like horrible.

77
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.710
Exactly.
Exactly.
Well that is the same.

78
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.790
This same philosophy is the reason why women approach now,

79
00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:21.660
and I say some women I should say,
cause they're super hyper aggressive,

80
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.380
career oriented women that work as hard or harder than men may be even harder to

81
00:04:25.381 --> 00:04:26.850
prove that there was tough as a man,

82
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.120
but they would take the approach that you and I would take.
They're like,

83
00:04:30.121 --> 00:04:34.010
fuck that life mean I'm not doing that.
Whereas it's PR,

84
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.240
statistically more males push themselves by working longer and harder hours on

85
00:04:39.241 --> 00:04:42.950
purpose to try to succeed.
It's just a natural thing.

86
00:04:42.951 --> 00:04:44.150
They're trying to win a game.

87
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.940
There's a competition you have is putting points on the board.

88
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.060
<v 1>By the time I serialism is fool's game to get into personally.
Yeah,</v>

89
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.510
I see people doing that.
My friends from high school and I'm like,

90
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:56.050
you're wasting your life for what?
For a digit number.

91
00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.510
You're not doing anything with yourself.

92
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.140
<v 0>The problem is when they get stuck in this loop of obligation,</v>

93
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.240
they get stuck in a loop of children and a mortgage and,

94
00:05:06.241 --> 00:05:10.540
and then once you have a car and a nice house and you know,

95
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:12.090
you maybe want to get a boat dude,

96
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.460
you get stuck and you have all these payments and obligations and you're not

97
00:05:15.461 --> 00:05:16.710
going to wear because you have a family.

98
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.080
Cause maybe you always wanted to be a rock and roll singer.
No.

99
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.230
And you never fucking got a chance to get out of the blocks and you're living

100
00:05:23.231 --> 00:05:26.800
your life in this angry state,
unfulfilled,
angry state.

101
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.090
So the advice is for the young advices for young people,

102
00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:33.970
the advices for people that look at their parents and all these other people

103
00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:35.410
that are telling them what they have to do.

104
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.410
Are they right the other or is there a fucking path out there?

105
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.210
If you just figure out what you really liked to do and just only go that way

106
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.690
because if you go this way and then I'm to take a couple of years off and go

107
00:05:48.691 --> 00:05:50.490
that way for a while and then I'm going to like,

108
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.880
I'm gonna to go back to school and get my degree just so I have something to

109
00:05:53.881 --> 00:05:57.350
fall back on.
You just didn't,
you don't,
you didn't get any further down road.

110
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.220
You're on the same spot.

111
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.120
<v 1>You would have been if he didn't do shit,
you gotta you gotta go forward.</v>

112
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.370
But if you something forward,
even if it's the wrong direction,

113
00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:06.620
is still getting experience doing something.

114
00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.120
You're finding out what it takes to succeed and make the decision on purpose in

115
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:12.890
order to get something you think is right.

116
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.220
I don't know what it's like to think more and more people are saying no to this

117
00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:18.680
old way of doing it and be like,
I want to be outdoors.

118
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:21.620
I value friendship over cash.
You know?
Things like that.

119
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:24.890
Experiences over fucking money and they're starting to go the other way.
