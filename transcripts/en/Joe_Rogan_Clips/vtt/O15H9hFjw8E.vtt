1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.290
Right down the Democratic Party.

2
00:00:01.291 --> 00:00:06.200
You don't have any candidate for president who's making reform,
uh,
uh,

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.220
even an important issue,
let alone a primary issue.
Um,

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.240
and of course we had a president who was elected under the drain,

5
00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:13.800
the swamp slogan,

6
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.820
but of course nobody believes he has any plan or any intent to do anything to

7
00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:19.570
drain that swamp.
Yeah.

8
00:00:19.571 --> 00:00:23.160
I'm hoping that having him in office is such a,

9
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.450
that the whole thing was such a cluster fuck and that so many people are so

10
00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:31.410
disturbed that it's going to make people more politically active and more aware

11
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.500
of the consequences of having someone like that in office.
Yeah.

12
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.030
And actually weirdly unifying.

13
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.020
Yeah.
Because even though the Democrats are not doing this right now,

14
00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:45.600
which is really depressing to me,
you know,

15
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.690
we have these things that we know we disagree about and we like fueled the

16
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.170
politics of hate as we kind of yell at each other about these things.

17
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.250
But there's a set of issues that we all agree about and the,

18
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.060
and the most important set of issues we all agree about is the deeply corrupted

19
00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:04.230
nature of this government.

20
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.320
And there was a poll done by a university of Maryland in the middle of 2016

21
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.540
asking about anger and frustration with government found the highest level of

22
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:14.190
frustration in the history of polling.

23
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.780
And then when they asked the reasons why they were so angry and so disaffected

24
00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:21.930
with their government,
the reasons people gave her all the same things,

25
00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:24.210
like the influence of money,
the influence of lobbyists,

26
00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:26.910
the parties care more about corporations and about,

27
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.960
and then then we broke them down about how to Republicans think about this and

28
00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:32.250
how to Democrats think about this.

29
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:36.600
There was no statistical difference between Republicans and Democrats.
You know,

30
00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:38.520
sometimes the Democrats were more concerned,

31
00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:43.410
sometimes the Republicans and the levels we're at like 80 and 90% so literally

32
00:01:43.411 --> 00:01:46.440
84% of Americans would say it is big money.

33
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.620
That is corrupting the way our Congress functions,
right?

34
00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:51.420
So here is common ground.

35
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.190
And what was so extraordinary about the 2016 election is watch a Republican

36
00:01:56.191 --> 00:01:58.810
candidate stand on a debate stage.
You know,

37
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.180
in September of 2015 Donald Trump stood on a debate stage and pointed to every

38
00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:05.220
one of those.
Kennedy's and said,
I own all of you.

39
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.640
I've given all of you money and I know the way the system works and the system

40
00:02:08.641 --> 00:02:09.474
is corrupt.

41
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.380
And he called Super Pacs and abomination and he attacked the idea of money in

42
00:02:13.381 --> 00:02:13.951
politics.

43
00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:18.951
And so what that signaled is that Republicans too could be rallied to this cause

44
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.220
of addressing this deeply corrupted political system.

45
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.490
If only we could find the candidates who would do it.

46
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.170
And I think what Donald Trump has done is teed up this moment where we can step

47
00:02:31.171 --> 00:02:33.390
back and say,
look,
we disagree about a lot of things,

48
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.660
whether it's GMO or climate change,

49
00:02:36.661 --> 00:02:39.450
whether it's healthcare for all or college for all,
whatever.

50
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.640
We disagree about a loving,
we got to work a lot of things out.

51
00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:46.140
But here is something we all agree about and we should be smart enough to

52
00:02:46.141 --> 00:02:47.940
realize if we don't fix this,

53
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.650
the nine of the things we're arguing about matter.
You know,
you can't,

54
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.190
it's not serious to stand on a debate stage and say you,

55
00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.070
you support single payer health care without also saying,

56
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:03.280
but first we're going to fix this corrupted system because there's no way to get

57
00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:07.420
single payer health care in a world where doctors and pharmaceutical companies

58
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:09.580
and insurance companies are funding elections.

59
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.440
You can't say you're going to get climate change legislation in America without

60
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:17.890
addressing the corrupting influence of money in politics because the oil camp

61
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:22.891
that the dirty energy industry has an enormous opportunity to block this change

62
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:25.470
through the way we fund campaigns.

63
00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:29.890
So this is a moment where we should be able to get everybody in this political

64
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:34.810
system to step back and say,
Hey,
wait,
the system's broken.
We can see as broken.

65
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.530
The first thing we have to do is to fix the broken congress.

66
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:39.970
And if we fix that Congress,

67
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.780
then we have a chance to have an argument about what policy makes sense for

68
00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:46.720
America.
And we each have our views,
but no views are different.

69
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:49.630
But the thing we don't agree about,
we should be able to agree on.
