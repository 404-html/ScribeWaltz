00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
That was one of the sadomasochist books that was turned into a movie.

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.310
Do you remember this movie starring Dan Akroyd?
No,
Dan Akroyd.
Oh,

3
00:00:09.311 --> 00:00:14.080
I do with Rosie O'donnell.
That's right.
It was a comedy,
right?

4
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.670
Was it supposed to be a comedy?
I mean it's,
it's beard was based off the story.

5
00:00:18.671 --> 00:00:22.720
So I think Gary Marshal might've turned it into a comedy.
Oh,
that's hilarious.

6
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.970
That's hilarious.
Bizarre.
She played a slow person.

7
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.420
Yes,
yes.

8
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.140
No,
I have it.
But Sean Penn has also played a slow person,

9
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.010
but no one has quite done it the way Ben Stiller did.

10
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.080
Did you see that people were getting mad because people,

11
00:00:44.081 --> 00:00:48.670
because some football player when as simple Jack,
the shorter oh boy.
Oh,

12
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.370
that's right.
Um,
but not just him.

13
00:00:51.371 --> 00:00:54.880
There's a couple other people that went as simple jack for Halloween and they

14
00:00:54.881 --> 00:00:57.310
were getting like,
you can't go with simple jack anymore.

15
00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.630
You can't be a simple person.

16
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.340
A simple character like dumb characters are now out the window.

17
00:01:04.341 --> 00:01:07.660
You can't be that anymore.
What happened?
What's going on with us?

18
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.930
Some weird new rules like popping up out of nowhere.
Like,
wait,
what Jack?

19
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.950
A parody of the thing,
like it was a,
it's a joke on a joke.

20
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.031
Play Simple Jack.

21
00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:21.230
It's not that he's actually portraying a realistic portrayal of,
right,
right.

22
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.230
Simple.
Jack was a character.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Even in the movie,
simple.

23
00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:29.740
John was a character in a movie,
wasn't like an actual person.
Yeah,

24
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.140
there it is.
Time.
There was a retard.

25
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.060
Wow.
Is that what it says in the movie?
Yeah.
It's a fake movie though,

26
00:01:40.061 --> 00:01:43.280
but wow.
I liked the scene.

27
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.020
That's not that long ago.
And here's the thing,
that movie also,

28
00:01:47.021 --> 00:01:48.250
that's all from tropic thunder.

29
00:01:48.251 --> 00:01:52.120
That movies also the last time anyone's allowed to wear black face.

30
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.020
That's it.
That's right.
That's it.
It's over now.
That's right.

31
00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.760
Like if Robert Downey jr tried to wear black face in tropic thunder to imagine,

32
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.710
just imagine blowback back.
Oh boy.

33
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.310
All the hurt feelings.
What happened?
Christina?
What happened?

34
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.710
They fused enormous question of what happened.

35
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.360
I'm hoping you have a fresh take on it.

36
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.470
I'll tell you want to know what I think it is.
Really?
Yes.
Okay.

37
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.970
I think since Donald Trump became the leader,

38
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.280
and I think some people are so triggered by Daddy,
right?

39
00:02:30.281 --> 00:02:32.440
Daddy's a little narcissistic at times.

40
00:02:32.441 --> 00:02:37.441
Daddy's not very socially conscious at times and I think that's affected it

41
00:02:38.081 --> 00:02:42.190
because if you say anything kind of insensitive than it's in align with that

42
00:02:42.191 --> 00:02:45.070
regime,
maybe,
you know what I mean?
Even though you're,
maybe you don't,

43
00:02:45.071 --> 00:02:49.600
I don't identify with everything.
Trump stands for it.
I like inappropriate humor.

44
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.670
Doesn't mean I aligned with him,

45
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.080
but I think because he doesn't give any sensitivity to these groups that are

46
00:02:56.081 --> 00:02:58.600
marginalized,
it makes the marginalized people upset.

47
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.970
I also think that people have realized that you can get people in trouble by

48
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:08.890
pointing out the fact they're insensitive and you can come down on them hard and

49
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:13.690
when you do,
they move.
Things happen.
There's like an a reaction.

50
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.820
Yeah,
this is happening.

51
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.060
What's interesting is the impulse to destroy it started with shaming.

52
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.440
Fire then take away their income.
Yeah.
Make them lose their house.

53
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.020
Disappear.
Louie CK banished.
Go away forever.
Right.

54
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.060
I'm not ready for you to come back yet.
Right.
Redemption and house.

55
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.400
When is redemption allowed?
How soon has he repented enough?

56
00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:43.100
Do we feel like he's earned that?
There's all kinds of stuff.
Yeah.

57
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.110
And then who's accused?
What are the grounds for accusation?

58
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.430
What's enough?
What's enough evidence?
Just somebody saying something.

59
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.820
It's good enough.
Believe all women,
which I believe obviously.
I mean,

60
00:03:54.821 --> 00:03:57.370
who the fuck,
you know?
But then again,
yeah,

61
00:03:57.371 --> 00:04:01.090
there are people who are allying who do say for sure,

62
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.500
but that believe all women thing.
Like what about Casey?
Anthony,
believe her.

63
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.030
You know what about Tonya Harding?
Believe her.
No.
Right?
He saw the movie.

64
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:11.950
Did you see the movie?
It's a funny,

65
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.050
there's a lot of dumb do you shouldn't believe.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There are people on on,

66
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.190
yeah,
exactly.
I only met her a liar with a vagina.
That's outrageous.

67
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.150
They have the giant is 10 wires.
There's a whole separate breed.

68
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.560
They're non gender specific.
That's right.
Oh,
that's interesting.
Minor.
