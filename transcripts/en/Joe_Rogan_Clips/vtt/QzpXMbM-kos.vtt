WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.720
Or three.
Two,
yes.

2
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.010
Alex Jones were alive.
Wow.

3
00:00:09.011 --> 00:00:12.190
It's going to be back for the second visit.
It's good to be here man.

4
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.870
It's good to see ya.
We've got Trump meeting with Kim Jong.
I'm,

5
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.790
we've got the colon hearings in Congress.
A lot of energy going on.
Well,

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.810
a lot of things are happening.
Planets are aligned.
Uh,

7
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.670
we should tell everybody that you and I had with,
first of all,

8
00:00:24.671 --> 00:00:28.870
we had a long conversation on the phone,
which led to just a lot of talk.

9
00:00:28.871 --> 00:00:31.090
You were driving to Vegas a few weeks ago.
It's not like an hour and a half.

10
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.390
And then we decided to do another podcast and we cleared the air on the phone.

11
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.660
We decided to clear the air more on a podcast.
There's a lot of things going on.

12
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.520
Um,
I told you a long time ago that it would have you back on.
And uh,

13
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.070
in the interest of being completely honest,
there was,
I was hesitant to do it.

14
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.750
Not because I didn't want to talk to you,

15
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.840
but because of just the amount of bullshit that I get from people that get angry

16
00:00:58.271 --> 00:01:01.810
that you and I are friends.
You know that.
Why give that guy a platform?

17
00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:05.160
That's the big one.
Why give that guy a platform?
That's the big one,
you know?

18
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.660
But you and I have always had a good time together.

19
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.190
We've always had fun together are only problems have always been when we're not

20
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.160
like if you're talking about me or if I'm talking about you,

21
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.330
not if we're talking to each other.

22
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.610
It's the distance has been the props to the telephone,
lack of communication.

23
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.160
The lack of communication has been the problem.

24
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.310
The thing that people are upset about you.

25
00:01:27.311 --> 00:01:30.780
The thing that we wanted to talk about like quick to get it over with or not.

26
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.290
Not Quick,
but just to get it upfront.
That's the best way.
Misrepresentative yes.

27
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.350
Is the sandy hooks.
Yes.
Yeah.
So

28
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.030
your take on it,
just give me your take on it.

29
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.660
Well first off,
because it's always misrepresented.

30
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.220
I believe mass shootings happen and they're real tragedies and I believe

31
00:01:52.221 --> 00:01:56.570
Parkland happened
and you believe Sandy Hook camp?

32
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.610
Absolutely,
and now just last year the media came out and said,

33
00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:05.450
Alex Jones says Parkland didn't happen and he sending people to Parkland

34
00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:09.290
parents' houses and there was no video.
No audio wasn't true.
I'd be,
like I said,

35
00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:11.000
I believe Parklawn happened show.

36
00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:13.250
I'm not going to be the mass shooting denial guy.

37
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.450
I have been branded as the sandy hook.

38
00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:20.451
I've and imagine a final cut pro video editing timeline and you go back almost

39
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.870
seven years ago,
I guess it's more than seven years now,

40
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.920
and the Internet didn't believe some of the things about sandy hook.

41
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.730
I started covering it weeks after my first articles and things are all this will

42
00:02:31.731 --> 00:02:35.300
be used for gun control and I bet the guys on Prozac and a mental patient,

43
00:02:35.301 --> 00:02:38.060
which he was of course then about couple weeks into it,

44
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.090
my listeners and other starts sending me all these anomalies and things and

45
00:02:43.281 --> 00:02:46.220
later turned out some of those anomalies weren't accurate and then I just moved

46
00:02:46.221 --> 00:02:49.340
on from it.
Okay.
I mean,
I'm not Animal Lanza.
I didn't kill those kids,

47
00:02:49.341 --> 00:02:52.400
but when I'm on the streets now,
people don't know who Adam Lanza is.

48
00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:55.940
The guy that killed those kids,
they think it's me.
They say,

49
00:02:55.941 --> 00:02:58.190
actually I believe you're not in prison for what you did to Sandy Hook.

50
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.320
All they know is Alex Jones,
Shani Hook dead kids show.
Well,
I don't think that's,

51
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.070
I think the majority of them are angry because the narrative has been that

52
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:09.550
you're sending people to the sandy hook families hopes homes.
Exactly,

53
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.020
and you'll never have the,

54
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:14.290
you're responsible for these people getting harassed because you said on your

55
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:17.080
radio show that it wasn't real.
Yes,

56
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.290
there is video and audio of me saying I can see out.

57
00:03:19.291 --> 00:03:22.310
People don't think it happened and I can see how people think it's synthetic

58
00:03:22.311 --> 00:03:26.500
users hers,
but stage events before that then gets edited,
put together,

59
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:29.530
cobbled together.
But I never said go to people's houses.

60
00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:33.340
I never said go investigate you and to say that you think it's not real.
Yes,

61
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:33.970
I did,

62
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.690
but now you do think it's real because I learned some of the anomalies were not

63
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:41.110
accurate.
That's a problem with all this conspiracy shit.
Right,

64
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.010
because the conspiracy theory stuff,
the people that want to believe,

65
00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:48.670
they believe in conspiracies with everything and I think there's a certain

66
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:51.310
percent,
and we talked about this just a few minutes ago.
Yeah.

67
00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:55.060
When I started getting accused for years ago,
a couple years into it,

68
00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:56.350
and I should know.
I think it happened

69
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.050
then people that I had interviewed and things you were just saying he's
involved.

70
00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:04.900
He's one of them because you are now saying that it happened.

71
00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:08.230
They thought that you had been compromised.
Yes,
and then I realized,
Oh,

72
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.410
this is how it works.
A certain percentage of people,
there's gets a phrenic.

73
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.710
Exactly,
and then they just think everything's a conspiracy.

74
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.090
This is the thing about conspiracies.

75
00:04:16.091 --> 00:04:19.390
It's very attractive to people that are schizophrenia,
schizophrenia.

76
00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:21.970
People think everything's a fucking conspiracy from top to bottom.

77
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:25.630
Every single interaction that people have is some sort of a stage event that's

78
00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:29.440
trying to take them down or control this or mind control that.

79
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.300
That's a big factor in a lot of this conspiracy theory shit.
His mental illness.

80
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.900
When I started to have people come to the office Shang that I'm a Beau bridges

81
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.820
or that I'm Jeff Bridges or that I am your bill here.

82
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.790
They'll hitch and people in restaurant screaming,
Fq Bill.
We know it's you.
It's,

83
00:04:47.791 --> 00:04:51.040
it's kind of like Dan rather than the guy threatening me,
I watch the signal.
Dan,

84
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.100
what's the [inaudible] what I've experienced now,

85
00:04:54.101 --> 00:04:57.640
the quote fame of being super famous mean the conspiracy guy.

86
00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.700
I was legitimately questioning things because of Gulf of Tonkin,

87
00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:03.700
Northwoods things.
It really happened.
Babies that weren't thrown on incubators,

88
00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:04.660
you're going to snack rack war,

89
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.370
but I kind of realized a few years ago that I kind of had my own mild psychosis

90
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.790
in that when you've been lied to by the media and the culture so much over and

91
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:16.450
over again,
everything,
then it starts becoming automatically.

92
00:05:16.451 --> 00:05:19.150
You're sure it's fake and that everything you,
she fits into that.

93
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.500
This would probably you'll get four or five years ago I began to realize because

94
00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:26.800
I was on the receiving end of people pulling up in white vans with guns at my

95
00:05:26.801 --> 00:05:29.650
office.
Chang,
I know you put a microchip in my head and I'm gonna kill you.

96
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.580
And so it was kind of like,
once I got super famous,
it was like,
whoa.

97
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.320
There's a certain percentage of people that are way off on the spectrum where

98
00:05:38.321 --> 00:05:39.460
they believe everything's fake.

99
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.310
And then there's people that believe everything they hear is true.
I mean,

100
00:05:42.311 --> 00:05:45.520
you should be,
you should be questioning,
you should have the right to do it,
but,

101
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:49.720
but it's somewhere in the middle.
And so this one will say about Sandy Hook.

102
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.760
I legitimately questioned it when people brought up anomalies.

103
00:05:54.761 --> 00:05:56.710
I then had debates about it on both sides.

104
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.550
The Internet pushed me to keep covering it.

105
00:05:58.551 --> 00:06:01.670
I probably covered it 20 times in the first few years it happened.

106
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.230
And then as soon as I questioned it,
uh,

107
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.170
not being staged,
I got attacked so much that I said,
screw it.

108
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.140
Mass shootings happen.
I believe that happened.
But then media would call me or,

109
00:06:14.141 --> 00:06:15.830
or interview me and say,
okay,

110
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.220
but tell us the anomalies of why you questioned.

111
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.200
They were getting me to say it again.

112
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.680
Not that I didn't have the right to question it,
but they thought,
well,

113
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:28.400
Alex Jones versus Ted kids,
Alex Jones denying an Alex Jones or asking families,

114
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.180
this is a perfect way to get this guy who so popular getting people to question

115
00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:35.600
and getting people to think.
And so it took me years,
I think I'm smart.

116
00:06:35.601 --> 00:06:37.430
I guess I'm not to figure out what's going on.

117
00:06:37.431 --> 00:06:41.170
So when Hillary few months before the election,
it gives us huge speech and says,

118
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.830
Alex Jones as a dark heart,
uh,
he knows sandy hook kids died,

119
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.490
but he says they didn't and he sends people their houses.

120
00:06:49.491 --> 00:06:51.890
He's the worst guy in the world.
So I came out and I said,
listen,

121
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.220
I never sent anybody to houses,
but I apologize.
It was taken out of context.

122
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.540
People have a right to question,

123
00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:59.820
but I am sorry for the families and I'm sorry for your hurt and I get it.

124
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.200
And I've experienced crazy people now.
Big Time.
Just like you have,

125
00:07:03.201 --> 00:07:07.280
please stop saying that.
I'm saying it didn't happen.

126
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.540
Please stop saying,

127
00:07:08.541 --> 00:07:11.570
I'm sending people to houses because here's what happens when they put it on

128
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.100
every major TV channel,
local TV channels,
radio,
I mean,

129
00:07:16.101 --> 00:07:20.450
I mean thousands of articles that then get syndicated.
I said 100,000 articles,

130
00:07:20.451 --> 00:07:21.320
that's a low number.

131
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.410
The amount of sandy hook coverage against me has been selling stain.

132
00:07:25.411 --> 00:07:28.490
It's so huge because it's supposed to be the first domino that once I'm taking

133
00:07:28.491 --> 00:07:31.340
down all the dominoes fall.
Well,
it's also clickbait.

134
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:36.260
There's also a thing if you say Alex Jones,
Sandy Hook and you put in a title,

135
00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:37.820
a certain amount of people,
we're just going to click on it.

136
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:42.290
Alex Jones is still pushing a sandy hook conspiracy theories one that I saw just

137
00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:44.660
two days ago.
Exactly,
so,

138
00:07:44.661 --> 00:07:48.920
so this is the point I've gotten to is here's the key.

139
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.860
They then they say more people are showing up in,

140
00:07:51.861 --> 00:07:53.930
in Connecticut and more people are coming to their houses,

141
00:07:53.931 --> 00:07:58.130
which they are because the media is all over the news saying there's a big

142
00:07:58.131 --> 00:08:01.190
conspiracy here.
Alex Jones says it doesn't happen.

143
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:04.610
And so people then hear it and they think,
oh,
you know,

144
00:08:04.611 --> 00:08:06.530
it's like looking for the moth man or something.

145
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:10.880
They're all running up there and the media saying it in my name and I'm saying,

146
00:08:10.881 --> 00:08:12.620
no,
I believe it happened years ago.

147
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.130
And so then I'm getting the blame and the attacks and the demonization and the

148
00:08:16.131 --> 00:08:20.000
threats for what the corporate media is saying over and over again that I'm

149
00:08:20.001 --> 00:08:21.080
saying that it didn't happen.

150
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.750
And the families are getting the threats and the families are getting the

151
00:08:23.751 --> 00:08:27.290
attacks and the families are getting called crisis actors.
Yes.

152
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:32.990
And then you can see for something different.
Oh my God.
In hindsight,

153
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.220
absolutely.
But again,

154
00:08:34.221 --> 00:08:39.221
I legitimately didn't think my show was as powerful as it was show that I wasn't

155
00:08:39.981 --> 00:08:43.160
retrospectively,
you know,
looking at everything I was doing as much as I should.

156
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.580
Nobody's perfect.
As you get older,
you grow when you learn things.

157
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:51.050
But I just began to realize about three years ago that they're making my

158
00:08:51.051 --> 00:08:53.630
identity not being a national,
it's not being a populace,

159
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:58.290
not being a free market guy.
They're making my whole identity sandy hook.

160
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.110
And I didn't know they were gonna sue me then.
Well,

161
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:03.810
it's just because that's what gets clicks.
Yes.
But then,

162
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.200
but then before I ever got sued,
I said,
I believe Sandy Hook happened.

163
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.110
That should not mind at,
I barely ever covered.
It's stop.
Right?

164
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:11.390
But you understand that's not what they do doing.

165
00:09:11.391 --> 00:09:14.160
They're not trying to make his weakness and made it even worse within not trying

166
00:09:14.161 --> 00:09:15.450
to make your identity.

167
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:20.010
They're not trying to define you or do some sort of a documenter,
a biography,

168
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:20.760
and your life.

169
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.120
They're just finding something that people want to pay attention to.

170
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.190
This is one of the problems with,

171
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.940
with news coverage today is that they find things that people want to pay

172
00:09:29.941 --> 00:09:34.230
attention to and they focus on them out of proportionate agree.

173
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:39.240
They say that I'm making money off sandy hook when when the newspapers and the

174
00:09:39.241 --> 00:09:44.090
publishing houses are using me as a lay to put out that had Shinier,

175
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.680
very hurtful thing.
Awesome to be hurtful.
I didn't mean to be in senior year.

176
00:09:47.681 --> 00:09:50.310
I was legitimately questioning because the Internet was,

177
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.610
and actually get a bunch of other stage stuff and then I say,
hey,
take it back.

178
00:09:53.611 --> 00:09:55.230
Don't do it.
And they go,
no,

179
00:09:55.231 --> 00:09:59.100
we're going to commit this hurtful thing that's chill free speech.

180
00:09:59.101 --> 00:10:02.440
But it's hurtful in your fricking name.
And then,
and then that's why,

181
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:03.750
and I'm not saying I'm the victim here,

182
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.010
I'm saying stop it because everything they do about the platform,
I me,

183
00:10:07.011 --> 00:10:10.080
the biggest frustration is I still have my huge audience and radio stations and

184
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:14.940
you'll infowars.com and [inaudible] dot com but reaching new people's very hard.

185
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.590
And then now that I've been silenced,

186
00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:20.730
the mainstream media can say whatever they want,
Joe,
about you,
about me.

187
00:10:20.731 --> 00:10:24.180
And I can't respond.
I mean,
you can go to Youtube and type in Alex Jones.

188
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.130
Well this is where you'll notice the negative stuff.

189
00:10:26.131 --> 00:10:29.880
And there's one that says white supremacy and Alex Jones and you click on it.

190
00:10:29.881 --> 00:10:33.270
It's a famous British actor and author saying,
Alex Jones says,

191
00:10:33.271 --> 00:10:36.750
kill the a of families of,

192
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:39.360
of Parkland parents.

193
00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.850
And I'm actually having lawyers getting ready to fall suit over this.

194
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.880
I warn the guy shouldn't let her,
she didn't take it.
Now I have to,

195
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.670
you could pull up this famous British actor,
I forget,
I forget his name.

196
00:10:47.671 --> 00:10:49.380
He can pull up.
You just type in Alex Jones that youtube,

197
00:10:49.381 --> 00:10:51.210
all the main stuff's put up on top.

198
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.450
It's like the seventh eighth link and it says Alex Jones and white supremacy

199
00:10:54.451 --> 00:10:58.350
what to do about it.
And he says,
Alex Jones and the lights of premise are saying,

200
00:10:58.351 --> 00:11:02.530
go to the people's houses at Parkland and kill the parents and we have to take

201
00:11:02.531 --> 00:11:04.140
him off the air because he says,
kill the parents.

202
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.440
There's no free speech for killing parents.
And I'm like,
dude,

203
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:11.340
do not say that I'm going to get killed.
I mean,

204
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:13.050
I am never said nobody died.

205
00:11:13.051 --> 00:11:16.020
It Parkman and I sure as hell didn't say kill their parents.
Let's,

206
00:11:16.021 --> 00:11:20.550
let's chill now.
Can you talk about fake news?
They have green lighted making,

207
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:25.200
anything you can imagine up about me.
And,
and it's like insane.

208
00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:27.540
And that's all I'm saying is,

209
00:11:27.541 --> 00:11:31.800
is that at a certain point it's like Jesus,

210
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:36.690
again,
let's,
let's take this step by step.
I'm sorry I'm writing this and this.

211
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:42.190
We want to give you an opportunity to communicate and clear the air and talk and

212
00:11:43.531 --> 00:11:46.330
some of the shit that you and I talked about earlier.
Um,

213
00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:50.190
there's a bunch of things going on.
One,
there's,

214
00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:54.310
it's a story that attracts people's attention,
right?

215
00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:59.530
A story of a guy who sang that people didn't get killed when they did get
killed.

216
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:02.110
And it's horrific for people to,
to look at.

217
00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.140
It's terrific to people to think about that their own children who not only get

218
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:08.620
murdered,
but then someone would accuse them of being a crisis actor.

219
00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:13.600
So then they start pushing that story and that story becomes something that they

220
00:12:13.601 --> 00:12:17.500
make money off of,
which is really in,
in some ways kind of ironic.

221
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:22.360
They keep this story in the news and they keep getting clicks off of you and

222
00:12:22.361 --> 00:12:25.250
misrepresenting some of the things that you've said yes.
And,

223
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:29.510
and some of the things that you said you wish you hadn't said,
that's,

224
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.590
that's also real.
But,
but I mean let's be clear,

225
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.940
I'm not even defending my shelf.
People learn stuff.
As you get older.
Hindsight,

226
00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:38.200
you're like,
why did I do that?

227
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.140
Like I used to whatever was the big hot thing on the Internet.

228
00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:44.320
I would just debate it cause it was interesting.

229
00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.510
But this is what I wanted to get to you.

230
00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:50.080
You were doing this show and in this show you're on the air hours and hours a

231
00:12:50.081 --> 00:12:54.550
day and you're ranting about all these various things.
Is,
is,

232
00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:59.560
is it fair to say that you weren't really 100% aware of what kind of influence

233
00:12:59.561 --> 00:13:02.860
you were having?
Absolutely.
If you did know,

234
00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.770
you would have phrase things differently and done things differently.

235
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.340
You know it's,
it's even beyond that.
I was just younger and,

236
00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:12.460
and I was covering what other people were saying.

237
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:14.800
I was not the first the 10th or a hundredth,

238
00:13:14.801 --> 00:13:18.700
the 10000th you're reading about it on the Internet was a firestorm all over the

239
00:13:18.701 --> 00:13:21.640
news that people are denying it.
And I've got producers going,

240
00:13:21.641 --> 00:13:22.630
hey look at this video.

241
00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.990
But isn't that the problem with every single national tragedy?

242
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.580
Anytime something happens,

243
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.340
there's a certain amount of people that think that there's a conspiracy,

244
00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:32.290
even when it's just a plane crash,

245
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.470
even when it's just what it fill in the blanks.
Any sort of national,

246
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.200
actually at an all,
I'm shaking ish,

247
00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:42.340
Shandy hooking up the hill on dying on I,

248
00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:47.650
I support people's right to question and I understand because there's been so

249
00:13:47.651 --> 00:13:50.760
much lying and corporate media and by governments and,
and,
and,

250
00:13:50.761 --> 00:13:53.170
and staged events that are admitted,

251
00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:57.100
the classified that once people see that one thing was staged than everything

252
00:13:57.101 --> 00:13:58.120
else must be stage.

253
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:03.480
And then I have been on the receiving end of literally thousands of made up

254
00:14:04.121 --> 00:14:08.800
conspiracies,
which you'll laugh at until people on a truckload gun show up.
Yeah.
