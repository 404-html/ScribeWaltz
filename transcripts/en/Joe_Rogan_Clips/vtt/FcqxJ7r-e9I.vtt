00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.730
The joe rogan experience.
What's up man?
How are you?
Fantastic.
You're good.

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.760
I feel good.
And that fill the,
if it would not be for my,
uh,
I like,
uh,
all sore,

3
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.400
that ad there would be a feel I feel better than than I when I was 25.
What did,

4
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.550
what did you have your colitis?
Yeah.
Call ideas yet.
What is that?

5
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.590
What causes that?
We don't really know what it caused it,

6
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.280
but uh,
the best,

7
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.890
the best theory is that,
uh,
before my last fight with Michael Bisping,

8
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:34.050
I tried to put on weight extra weight.

9
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.850
So I followed a diet or program that I was eating every,

10
00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:43.680
almost every two hours.
And um,
I think our system is like a car,

11
00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:47.280
you know,
if you do a lot of mileage,
it overuse it.

12
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.220
And so that's what happened with the stress and everything.

13
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.440
During my training camp at big problem,
you know,

14
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.120
I couldn't sleep at crazy cramps.
You know,
sometime I add blood.

15
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.490
Even like when I went to the bathroom and I want to go do some tests because I

16
00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:06.960
was worried that it was something more like,
I mean it's collide is very serious,

17
00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:11.880
but that it was like cancer or something cause he had blood.
So I did some tests.

18
00:01:11.881 --> 00:01:14.190
It came out and they get to live and I said to myself,
I said,

19
00:01:14.191 --> 00:01:17.700
this fight being delayed,
delayed,

20
00:01:17.701 --> 00:01:21.060
but postponed so many times that if I do something,

21
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.910
if I say that perfectly,
what is going on,

22
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.310
I'm going to lose the opportunity to fight for the title at one 85 so I,

23
00:01:28.311 --> 00:01:32.970
I keep it shut and I told myself,
I said,
whatever it is,

24
00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:36.930
I'll deal with it after the fight.
So I did the fight.
Everything went well.

25
00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:39.990
Then afterward I went to do a,
it's called a colonoscopy.

26
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.510
They put a camera inside of you?
Yeah,
and I did,

27
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.670
I got diagnosed with also colliders.

28
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.070
That's probably be the mix of distress and also the,

29
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.090
the fact that I was constantly eating,
I was eating and it not only eating Joe,

30
00:01:51.091 --> 00:01:54.240
I was trying to put on some weight.
It was very hard.
Sometime I was,

31
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.420
I remember many times I was having breakfast but I was regurgitating,

32
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.590
regurgitating my breakfast truing up cause you were just eating too much food

33
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:02.530
but add to,

34
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.500
because I needed to keep my seven a certain weight and def.

35
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.280
The crazy thing about it is first not realize it's a mistake.

36
00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:12.210
I should never have done it.

37
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.810
But when I made the weight at the one 85 the day before the fight,

38
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.150
I could not go back up to a one 90 there's a,

39
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.330
the higher side was going back up so that they have that fight.

40
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.480
I woke up and I add a little breakfast.
I chew up my breakfast again.
Wow.

41
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.690
Yeah.
Wait.
I was really messed up.
Then I went to weigh myself.

42
00:02:33.691 --> 00:02:37.140
I was like [inaudible] 91 they wow.
Yeah.
And what do you think Mike Wade,

43
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.270
you felt very strong.
I mean it's not really the weight at this time because

44
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.500
the way that you weigh right now,
depending on what you eat,

45
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.310
you have a lot of stuff inside your,
your your intestine and everything.

46
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.140
So you and also water retention.

47
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.480
I felt like I had a lot of water retention and,
um,
unnecessary weight.

48
00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.300
Exactly.
So it's like dead weight.

49
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.020
The second bag that you carry on your shoulders show what I should have done,

50
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:05.800
I think is just stay the same way that I am.
My natural weight.

51
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:10.801
I think nobody has a way that it's his best wait to perform an athletic

52
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:14.110
performance.
And that's what I should have done.
Right.

53
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.630
But it was a mistake of my part.
It was a big mistake.

54
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:19.450
So you were just thinking that because you're going up to one 85 and you're

55
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:22.930
fighting a guy in Bisbing that used to fight at two oh five.
Exactly.

56
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:24.790
He's a pretty big guy.
Exactly.
That.

57
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:27.940
I taught that to perform better.

58
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:31.480
I needed to elevate my weight.
But by doing that I create,

59
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.700
I create the big problem of FEA healthy.
She was so,
and that,

60
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.100
that colitis didn't exist before that,
eh,

61
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.170
not that I got diagnosed for.
No,
no.
And uh,

62
00:03:43.171 --> 00:03:46.540
I think that that's what trigger it.
And so after the fight,

63
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.710
now they've gone back to a normal diet.
Has it changed?
So,
so after that fight,

64
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.440
what happened?
And it's very interesting too,

65
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.280
I got an on medication and I met a doctor that,

66
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.890
his name is Jason Fung is in Toronto.
People can research,
has,
is amazing,

67
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.430
amazing guy.
And I met a doctor that,

68
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.470
that treat people with cancer and diabetes with the intermittent fasting.

69
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.100
So I started doing a program of intermitted fasting and time restricted eating

70
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.110
and all my symptoms diminish like every,
every week,
every month diminish.

71
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.110
So he's got the,
it's getting better.
It's not 100% now,

72
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.460
but he's getting out a lot better,
a lot better.
And I feel a lot better.

73
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.380
A lot of people eat like that now.
We had Ben Greenfield on yesterday who,
uh,

74
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.130
you know,
he's a,
a journalist,
does a lot of experimenting with his body,

75
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.150
thought a lot,
a lot of scientific stuff and scientific,
uh,
uh,

76
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.050
research on diet and in restricted eating is a big part of it.

77
00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:46.710
He does a lot of that.
It's interesting because I'm,

78
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.890
we're conditioned to think that,
uh,
when,
uh,
I want to gain muscle,

79
00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:53.980
don't want to get,
you know,
I need to eat more to accelerate my method,

80
00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:54.540
but it isn't,

81
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.540
but I never felt better in my life if we would not be for that particular issue.

82
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.330
I feel better now.
I sleep better.
Uh,
I uh,

83
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.350
inflammation and I'll,
I'll also did a test in January.

84
00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:13.270
I went to McGill university to do a scan of my,
uh,
my weight,

85
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.870
my purse,
my fat percentage,
my uh,
muscle density,

86
00:05:16.871 --> 00:05:19.900
bone density and my,
I'm in five months.

87
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.350
I did it that few days ago.
Like not,
not this week,

88
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.430
the Tuesday of that last week.
And My,
uh,
my fuck person,

89
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:29.890
that dish has a decrease.

90
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.730
My muscle mass has increased and my weight is that,

91
00:05:33.731 --> 00:05:36.220
that same than it was in January.

92
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.810
And you think this is all from restricted eating?
My,

93
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.540
my training did not have to change.

94
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.580
So they only thing has changed pretty much is the,
the,
the,

95
00:05:43.581 --> 00:05:48.580
the restricted restricted time eating and intermittent fasting.

96
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:49.291
Yes.
Yeah.

97
00:05:49.291 --> 00:05:53.290
That intermittent fasting gives your digestive system a break and it lets your

98
00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:57.210
body recuperate better.
I think that that's what had helped me out.
Uh,

99
00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.830
the mostly I think that's what it is a it I felt like,
uh,
I was like,

100
00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.300
like I said,
like a car.
I was,
he was putting too much for nothing.

101
00:06:05.301 --> 00:06:08.950
And I think as human being,
we're overfed.
I,
um,

102
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.140
I'm very interested about paleontology and,
and also a history.

103
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:18.150
And I know that human being an enter gatherer time then not eat two meals a day.

104
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.190
No,
they maybe a few times a week.

105
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.000
But when they eat they eat a lot cause I need to do with fast.

106
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.350
So I think it's more natural for a human being to do so.
And also,

107
00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.710
I now I read a lot of stuff and I watch a lot of stuff on the Internet.

108
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:37.730
How about intermittent fasting and time?
Restrict the day eating.
And I just wish,

109
00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:42.590
I,
I knew that before,
uh,
for so many years.
I,
I,
I,

110
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.950
I used to follow the rules are we need to eat at least three times a day.

111
00:06:45.951 --> 00:06:49.520
And you know,
I don't really care of what I eat,
but I,
I've,
you know,

112
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.820
even though in the morning I was not hungry,
I was always,

113
00:06:53.821 --> 00:06:56.720
am I forcing myself to eat,
which is bad,
you know?

114
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.070
<v 1>Okay.</v>
