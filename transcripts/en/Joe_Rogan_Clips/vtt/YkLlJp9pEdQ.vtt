00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.020
The joe rogan experience.
Well,
China,

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.030
China's on the side of North Korea.
That's part of the problem.

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.880
That's a part of our problem.
We can go,
she's still technically at war.

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.750
Most people don't know North Korea and South Korea.
Yeah,

5
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.290
they signed a cease fire.
They never signed an armistice.
Oh Wow.

6
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.760
So then there's no peace treaty.
They just will stop fighting for right now.

7
00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:21.700
And it helps open a Hawaii the other day.
Yeah.

8
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.920
What the fuck man,
I fucking with us Kelly Slater's Instagram.

9
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.540
I was like,
what?

10
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.720
There was a fake nuclei or a fake missile warning that a missile was coming in

11
00:00:34.511 --> 00:00:38.980
and they said it was not a drill.
Like how was that a wrong button kind of thing.

12
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.040
Like you must go through a few people before it goes out to the whole state and

13
00:00:45.101 --> 00:00:48.970
you know how you getting a phone call and you have the other option.
Yeah,

14
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.030
exactly.
So like say,
Hey,
I'll call you back.
I'm driving.
You know,

15
00:00:53.031 --> 00:00:55.780
like it's one of the two or three options that you could just press.
Yeah.

16
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.290
Is one of them.
Hey,
an intercontinental ballistic missiles heading your way.

17
00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:02.440
Hawaii.
It's like,
oh,
here's the weather.
Here's missile,
and you hit the wrong.
No,

18
00:01:02.441 --> 00:01:05.290
it shouldn't work that way.
Shouldn't be anywhere near like that.

19
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.010
Come on to the whole state.
So Stu Mcfarlane,
who was long,
her Instagram,

20
00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:13.450
I was like,
yeah,
apparently is a missile.
It was the same shit.
I was unbelievable.

21
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.650
People were fucking crying and freaking out,
apparently.
Yeah.

22
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.880
I have a friend that lives in Hawaii.

23
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.240
You know that's a state that's been hit before.
Fuck yeah.
Yeah.
Right.

24
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.330
So you gotta think mean memory of Pearl Harbor.

25
00:01:25.331 --> 00:01:27.250
This is people who were alive back then.
Plenty of them.

26
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.770
Jeremy Mother fucking Steven's dom,
dom,

27
00:01:32.771 --> 00:01:37.180

This should be war.
I am very excited about this.

28
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.110
