1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.410
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.580
I think there's a balance to doing things and it's highlighted by what you just

3
00:00:06.581 --> 00:00:07.810
said,
what you've just said.

4
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.400
There's a balance and it's a lot of what we were talking about earlier about uh,

5
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.460
Joel Jamison versus Louie Simmons versus like someone who's like super technical

6
00:00:17.711 --> 00:00:21.550
versus someone who's just a fucking mad dog and just wants you to just go out

7
00:00:21.551 --> 00:00:22.840
and do it and don't be a pussy.

8
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.380
Your your mindset that allowed you to take that fight with no training and then

9
00:00:28.391 --> 00:00:31.450
take another fight after that with no training and then take another fight out

10
00:00:31.451 --> 00:00:34.840
to that would know t d just this mindset of fuck it,
let's just do this.

11
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.310
There's a balance between that and then you realizing,
okay,

12
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.730
I got to really learn how to do this.
If I'm going to really be a fighter,

13
00:00:45.731 --> 00:00:50.410
I'm going to be really be a really defined myself and I'll really go out and

14
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.080
make a mark.
I got to learn what the fuck I'm doing.

15
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.550
Exactly this both things there.
That's that balance.
Like you need both things,

16
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.080
you know?
I mean it's,
it's,
you have to have a certain amount of fuck it in you,

17
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.340
you know,
you have to have a certain amount for a sport.
I mean,

18
00:01:06.341 --> 00:01:09.550
is he called an MMA a sport?
It always seemed to me to be,

19
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.730
it's too,
it's too defining.

20
00:01:15.731 --> 00:01:19.540
It's or two.
Uh,
it's,
it's too limited.

21
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.850
It's not fighting is more than a sport.

22
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.260
It's an expression of what you're capable of.
Absolutely.
It's,

23
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.570
you are who you are as a human.

24
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.820
<v 1>And that's where a one distinction I've made over the years is the difference</v>

25
00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:34.800
between Marshall skills in martial arts.
Every,

26
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.400
everybody always calls everything and copies it into a martial art.

27
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.720
And when we go to the gym and we're training armbars do a hundred arm bars,

28
00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:43.554
that's not art.

29
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.510
That's not your expression of your body in a combat scenario.

30
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.710
That's a,
that's a martial skill.
Now when we go in competition,

31
00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:55.920
now we're expressing our R and I think this is an important distinction to be

32
00:01:55.921 --> 00:01:59.850
made.
I think it's something that,
uh,
I get so tired of hearing,
you know,

33
00:01:59.851 --> 00:02:02.850
I trained martial arts and you know,
I trained martial skills.

34
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:04.380
And then I express my art.

35
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.430
<v 0>That's a very interesting way of putting it.</v>

36
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.680
How many years after you initially started seriously training where you on the

37
00:02:11.681 --> 00:02:15.130
ultimate fighter?
Uh,
four or five.

38
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.970
I remember when you were on the ultimate fighter and they stole your chew.

39
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.270
Somebody fuck with you.
Treat everybody remembers him.
Well,

40
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.250
I remembered that because I remember like there's some dudes that,

41
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.800
there's some guys that play tough guy.

42
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.180
There's some guys that put on a show and puff up their chest and say some shit

43
00:02:31.181 --> 00:02:33.070
that they might not necessarily mean.

44
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.130
And then there's some guys that say some shit and you go,

45
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.710
oh this dude's fucking serious.

46
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.820
When they fucked with your kid or with your shoe.

47
00:02:42.821 --> 00:02:46.510
I remember watching that and go,
this motherfucker serious.
I'm like,

48
00:02:46.511 --> 00:02:50.770
Matt Brown is not a joker.
And then when you fought Matt Arroyo,

49
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.750
that was a another example of it.
I'm like there's skill wise Mike matter.

50
00:02:54.751 --> 00:02:59.110
Roy was a very talented guy and still is good Jujitsu guy.
Good.

51
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.870
But there was something that was a battle of minds.
I agree.
Your mind,

52
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.710
<v 1>I don't know if you knew that I fought him before that too.
Yeah,
I did.
Right.</v>

53
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.860
But the first time I fought,
and this is why it was such a,
a no brainer to say,

54
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:16.410
to fight,
I fought him the first time on 24 hours notice.
So I wasn't even,

55
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.820
I wasn't training her and I was training a girl and she was going to Florida to

56
00:03:20.821 --> 00:03:23.550
fight.
And when I got there,

57
00:03:23.551 --> 00:03:26.550
we're driving to the weigh ins and the promoter,

58
00:03:26.551 --> 00:03:30.120
I heard him talking on the phone and he goes,
and I heard him say,
you know,
oh,

59
00:03:30.121 --> 00:03:33.060
we don't have an opponent for him.
Uh,
so I said,
hey,
you know,

60
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.770
what do you need opponent for?
And he's like,
wow,

61
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:40.170
this guy mad Arroyo one 70.
And I said,
dude,

62
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.640
I'll fight like how much we pay me and then I can have 400,
500 bucks.
I was like,

63
00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:49.560
dude,
I pay my rent.
Fuck yeah,
I'll do it.
And um,
yeah,
so,

64
00:03:49.561 --> 00:03:53.190
and I said,
you know,
I can't make weight because I got like one hour and uh,

65
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.571
you know,
he said it.

66
00:03:54.571 --> 00:03:57.240
He said it's cool and fight him on 24 hours notice and beat him.

67
00:03:57.241 --> 00:04:00.640
So he wanted redemption for that.
You know,

68
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:02.990
<v 0>that fight was you,</v>

69
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.030
one of the things about like watching you fight as someone who's seen a lot of

70
00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:11.770
people fight,
there's,
there's moments in exchanges were after the exchange,

71
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.790
a gile tried to take a break or gow try to catch his breath or move pays that

72
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.370
bigotry break.
Yeah,
call it,

73
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.720
there's little breaks and then there's guys recognize those breaks and push in

74
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.410
and you're a guy who pushes in.
Absolutely.
When there's a break you're like,

75
00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:29.140
oh no motherfucker,
there's no breaks here.
There's no breaks here.

76
00:04:29.141 --> 00:04:33.380
And you just get on dudes.
And it makes things very intense.
Yeah.

77
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.480
That's the thing about all your fights.
They're very intense.
You know,
there's a,

78
00:04:37.481 --> 00:04:41.260
there's a certain level of violence that you bring into the octagon that someone

79
00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:43.600
has to be prepared for,
you know,

80
00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:47.260
and there's some guys that are prepared for it and it makes for amazing fights,

81
00:04:47.261 --> 00:04:51.350
like your fight with Robbie Lawler.
Holy Shit.
Was that a crazy fight?
You know?

82
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.770
And then there's guys who just,
they just can't keep the pace.

83
00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:56.410
They just can't keep that then keeping you off of them.

84
00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.300
<v 1>Yeah.
And I think w um,</v>

85
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.630
my goal as a martial artist,
as a fighter Marshall,

86
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.840
uh,
you know,
whatever you would call a combat guy,
you know,

87
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.550
I had to get my skills up to the point where your mind where it matches the
mind.

88
00:05:12.551 --> 00:05:15.280
Yeah.
And crazy.
Yeah.
I mean,

89
00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:20.281
a lot of guys struggle the other way and I think one of the things that I talk

90
00:05:21.191 --> 00:05:25.570
about a lot that you see,
I don't think that I was necessarily born this way.

91
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.030
This is where I think a lot of people get confused.
I mean,

92
00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:34.690
I was certainly born with an inclination towards fighting.

93
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.480
I wouldn't be where I'm at without that.
But,
you know,
uh,

94
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.470
I work a lot on my mind.
I do a lot of stuff.

95
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.550
I've always been obsessed with martial arts and combat as a whole.

96
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.160
And I hear other people say they're obsessed.
Like,
Connor,

97
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.230
you made it really famous when he started saying it.
Right.

98
00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.150
I think my obsession goes far,
far beyond what anybody's even even close to.

99
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.880
I don't think they're there.
Uh,
definition of obsession,
even,
uh,
even,
uh,

100
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.920
is comparable to mine at all.
I mean,
I'm,
I'm far more obsessed.
I,

101
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:13.620
I've read probably I got a library of sports psychology,
books of,

102
00:06:13.621 --> 00:06:18.160
of strength conditioning,
books of a martial arts,
books,
all this stuff.
Um,

103
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.450
I mean it's literally on my mind 20 hours a day,

104
00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:23.600
but one of the things I really focus on is the,
the sports psychology part.

105
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:29.230
And I think that is why it's expressed that way in the fight.

106
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.150
Um,
and you hear a lot of people,
they'll say,
yeah,

107
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.290
how often have you heard like men,
you know,
my mind is already strong.
Like,

108
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:39.110
I ain't scared when I walked in.
There are stupid shit like that.

109
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:44.030
And I always say,
you know,
do you think Michael Jordan stopped packs and layups?

110
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.940
Do you think Jordan Burroughs stopped practicing double legs?

111
00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:50.060
Do you think that on a shorts and niggers stopped doing bicep curls?

112
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.440
It because it's good doesn't mean that you stop.
Yeah.

113
00:06:54.441 --> 00:06:57.010
It can be improved upon and you don't stop.
So,

114
00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.090
and I think the mind is one of those things that can always be better.

115
00:07:02.091 --> 00:07:04.040
Like we're not tapping into,
I mean,

116
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.800
what are we talking is like 10% of our brains and that's all blessed.

117
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.260
<v 0>Yeah.
That's bullshit.
You know,
they used to think that.</v>

118
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.070
They used to think that they used to it.
That's something they say.

119
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.310
But the reality is,
uh,

120
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.680
your brain has a bunch of different quadrants for all sorts of different

121
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:22.760
functions.
So when you know you're utilizing a certain portion of your brain,

122
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:26.900
that's the portion of your brain that's responsible for those actions.
Okay.
Yeah.

123
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:28.160
There's not either way.

124
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:32.720
Our minds are certainly far more unlimited and far more potential than we're

125
00:07:32.721 --> 00:07:33.340
tapping into.

126
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:38.340
I think your mind is a lot like your body and it performs and it does what you

127
00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:41.120
ask of it.
And if you just are lazy pitch,

128
00:07:41.121 --> 00:07:44.420
it doesn't do anything but sit around and watch TV and you don't ever challenge

129
00:07:44.421 --> 00:07:48.430
your mind.
I think your mind is weak and it atrophies.
Absolutely.
Yeah.

130
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:49.960
When you say that you,

131
00:07:49.961 --> 00:07:52.580
you have all these books and you say that you work on your mind,

132
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:57.050
like do you have a daily practice that you do?
Do you meditate,
you can meditate?

133
00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:01.670
<v 1>Um,
you know,
daily is sort of a,
uh,</v>

134
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.400
I hate saying I do it daily cause you know,
I skipped days and,

135
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:09.510
and I mean I have three kids,
which,
you know,
how that goes and yeah,
it's a very,

136
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:10.800
um,

137
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.800
but at the same time I try to use everything as an opportunity to practice on my

138
00:08:16.141 --> 00:08:21.000
mind too.
Right.
Um,
um,
how you do anything is how you do everything.

139
00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:24.690
Right?
Right.
Um,
and so I think,
you know,

140
00:08:24.691 --> 00:08:28.980
we can use opportunities all the time and uh,
but yes,

141
00:08:28.981 --> 00:08:33.110
I do meditate,
I do tons of visualization.
I have a,
um,

142
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.150
my strength conditioning coach I work with now,
he's a,

143
00:08:36.151 --> 00:08:38.010
he's also got degree in sports psychology.

144
00:08:38.011 --> 00:08:42.330
So we integrated a lot of that in the training itself.
Uh,
for instance,

145
00:08:42.331 --> 00:08:45.370
like doing,
we do these 200 yard sprints on the forest treadmill,

146
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:49.020
or they're just miserable.
That,
I mean,
by the time you're done,

147
00:08:49.021 --> 00:08:51.420
you just don't have anything left.
It's a complete drain.

148
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:55.500
And then as soon as you're done,
like if stand at attention,
right,
I have to in,

149
00:08:55.530 --> 00:09:00.450
you know,
like a military attention,
straight up and down and not let the,
uh,

150
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.373
the,

151
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:06.630
the concept of your body's shutting down affect your ability to maintain a

152
00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:08.670
posture.
Right?
And that's just a mental thing,
you know,

153
00:09:08.671 --> 00:09:12.570
100% right is solely mental.
Um,
the,
that's just one example.

154
00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.000
We do a million things like that.
Um,
but yeah,
I do,

155
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:19.560
I do tons and tons of visualization,
which is,
uh,
uh,
consistent,

156
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:24.840
uh,
marker of high performers are consistent thing that high performers do.

157
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:29.090
I think this is a well known.
Um,
I have a,

158
00:09:29.091 --> 00:09:33.240
a mental coach specifically that kind of holds me accountable for a lot of the

159
00:09:33.241 --> 00:09:38.040
things,
you know,
me and him,
we talk a lot back and forth about the different,
uh,

160
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:43.260
the different,
um,
ways to create habits.

161
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.530
I think that's probably the number one thing is creating habits.
Right?
Um,

162
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.470
you know,
but you know,
he holds me accountable for everything and not take,

163
00:09:49.471 --> 00:09:54.330
that's probably the biggest key is just being held accountable for every action

164
00:09:54.331 --> 00:09:57.750
that you do.
Have you ever used a sensory deprivation tank?
Absolutely.
My,
uh,

165
00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:00.360
my strength coach has one.
Beautiful,
yeah,
I love it.

166
00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:05.010
And I go in about 45 to an hour to work on shit in there.

167
00:10:05.011 --> 00:10:09.630
Do you think about techniques?
Um,
you know,
I don't really,
uh,

168
00:10:09.631 --> 00:10:12.080
I used that as a time,
so I've,

169
00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:15.420
I tried to practice this form of meditation that I,
you know,

170
00:10:15.421 --> 00:10:18.780
I can't remember the name of it,
this dude,
um,
Kish tomorrow.

171
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:20.880
You ever heard of him?
Krishnamacharya,

172
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:23.520
I don't know why he's not coming to my head right now,

173
00:10:23.521 --> 00:10:25.080
but he was one of Bruce Lee's guys.

174
00:10:25.081 --> 00:10:28.610
He's an Indian metta meditation guy and everything.
And um,

175
00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:33.630
his form of meditation was to completely clear your mind,
which is,

176
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.600
I guess I is actually impossible,
right?

177
00:10:36.601 --> 00:10:38.640
Like there's no way to just have no thought at all,

178
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:44.180
but that's sort of what I try to strive for is go literally no mind at all.

179
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.460
What I do is think about only my breath.
That's it.

180
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.490
I concentrate on my breathing in and when I do that and there's a bunch of other

181
00:10:50.491 --> 00:10:51.630
shit that gets in there,

182
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:56.580
but eventually I can kind of overpower it and just think only about breathing in

183
00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:01.230
and out.
So that's what I do to get to that state [inaudible] right?

184
00:11:01.231 --> 00:11:05.380
To get to a state where I can release everything.
But at that point,
once out,

185
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:10.320
mom relaxed,
then I go for the,
uh,
the no mine,
which again is a,
it's impossible.

186
00:11:10.321 --> 00:11:11.210
But,
um,

187
00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:16.270
my personal system of visualization or relaxation is I see the thoughts as

188
00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:22.980
clouds and the,
my mind is a sky or space.
So,
you know,

189
00:11:22.981 --> 00:11:26.190
my mind becomes this gigantic,
uh,

190
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:30.420
entity and the thoughts are just clouds that pass by.
But again,

191
00:11:30.421 --> 00:11:33.270
when I start thinking about things like that,
now you're not in the,
no mine.

192
00:11:33.271 --> 00:11:35.490
If you start thinking about your breath,
you're not in the know mine.
Right?

193
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:39.030
And I want to get as close to it as possible because in a fight,

194
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.780
in a combat situation,
I want no mind.
Right?
That's the,

195
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.230
as the way that Musashi talks about,
right?
Yeah.

196
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.300
And as customer Sasha right there.
Oh,
fuck.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

197
00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:52.500
This was a rings play on massage.

198
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:04.430
<v 2>Yeah.</v>
