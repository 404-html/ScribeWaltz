1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.930
The joe rogan experience and draping topical CBD oil,

2
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.210
which is a really good,
yes,
yes.
CBD is illegal across the board.
Okay.

3
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.790
Non Non psychoactive,
but the FDA is trying to stop that.
Of course.

4
00:00:15.791 --> 00:00:17.550
Follow the money.
Yeah,
it was creeps.

5
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.570
It's a good explanation for just about everything.
Yeah.

6
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.590
They're trying to put it in the same classification as heroin.
It's hilarious.

7
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.460
Yeah.
So stupid.
It's just 100% pharmaceutical drug companies.

8
00:00:27.461 --> 00:00:30.970
Institutions of decision making.
Yup.
Well it's just creepy.

9
00:00:30.971 --> 00:00:34.060
People with money that don't want to lose money to CBD oil because it's so much

10
00:00:34.061 --> 00:00:38.340
better for you and healthy and natural and does the exact same passion.

11
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.180
How much the drug companies would lose or gain if they started selling.

12
00:00:43.181 --> 00:00:48.070
It fucks just,
they want to monopolize it.
That's the problem.
They want patents.

13
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.120
They want to be able to patent things.
You know?
That's,
but that's a,

14
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.910
like we were talking about before about the things that are in the Amazon.

15
00:00:54.911 --> 00:00:59.911
I mean it stayed there so many different plants that can deal with so many

16
00:01:00.311 --> 00:01:04.930
different ailments that people have.
But I,
Alaska,
yeah,
that's one of them.

17
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.920
Sure.
Have you done it?
I haven't,
but it's kind of interesting.
Yeah.

18
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.600
Have you done any psychedelics?
No.
No.
Never done drugs ever?
No drugs,
no pot ever?

19
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.100
Never.
Oh,
you scared?

20
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.350
<v 1>No.
I just,</v>

21
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.260
my dad's scared the living daylights out of me when I was a kid and he told me

22
00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:22.550
that if I ever,
he's like,
you get tested for drugs and you fail,
you,

23
00:01:22.551 --> 00:01:23.910
you won't ever be a race car driver.

24
00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:25.870
You told me that about drinking and driving too.
If you get,

25
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.930
if you lose your license,
you won't be able to race.
And then,
you know,

26
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.200
what are you going to be when you grow up then?
You know,

27
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.270
he threatened me with Oh dad.
Remedial remedial jobs and um,

28
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.370
yeah,
so he'd scared the living daylights out of me.

29
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.910
Truth be told you can lose your license still race.
Also,
truth be told,

30
00:01:41.911 --> 00:01:46.380
I didn't get drug tested until way later,
but we do get drug tests.

31
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.260
<v 0>You're running a drug farm.
Oh,</v>

32
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.580
well one you're wanting a drug farm.
Well,
kind of I guess a drug farm lady.

33
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.240
It's legal buck 20 a hundred percent drug farm.
It's wonderful,

34
00:01:58.241 --> 00:02:01.600
delicious taste in drugs.
It sure is.
Yes.

35
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.140
That's fucked up on wine.
Yeah.
And what does that,
that's true.

36
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.450
And addicted to drinking alcoholism.

37
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.830
I mean there's a lot of other things that you can do that I know altering that

38
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.510
aren't addictive.
Right?
You're running a plant based drug farm.
100% cash crops.

39
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.160
Yeah.
So are you doing,
you're a drug dealer.
Well let's just go all the way.
Well,

40
00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:24.220
if I was going to do something,
what would be the first thing I would do?
Pot.
Oh,

41
00:02:24.221 --> 00:02:28.600
for sure.
Okay.
Nice and light.
Real slow.
Don't take much.
What does that mean?

42
00:02:28.601 --> 00:02:31.490
Don't take much.
It just take a little bit.
You don't want to freak out.
Like the,

43
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.210
one of the major problems that people have when they first start smoking pot,

44
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.620
they'll take like two or three heads and he can take one one like that's it.

45
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.390
Put it down,
right Jamie.
Yeah.
Jamie will tell you,
okay,
we'll hit walkaway.

46
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.990
Yeah,
don't fuck with edibles.
Leave those alone.
Those,

47
00:02:46.991 --> 00:02:49.150
those you need to build up to those things.
Those are,

48
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.740
those are completely different experience.
I experienced users.
Well,

49
00:02:53.741 --> 00:02:55.900
it's not just that even experienced users,

50
00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.110
they don't recognize the fact that it's a completely different psychoactive.

51
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.580
Yeah,
yeah.
When THC,
THC,
no,

52
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.270
when it's processed by your liver produces 11 hydroxy metabolite,

53
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.470
which is four to five times more psychoactive than THC.
It's way more potent.

54
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.251
Whoa.
Yeah.

55
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:15.810
Which is why people far reach out when they eat edibles and they just don't,

56
00:03:15.811 --> 00:03:17.680
don't eat the whole Brownie.
No.

57
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.360
She's a couple crumbs and then don't even think about having any more for at

58
00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:24.730
least two hours.
Let it settle in.
Let it,
yeah.

59
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.790
<v 1>Give yourself time.
Don't freak out if for 15,
20 minutes and be like,</v>

60
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:31.870
it's not working.
Right.
Don't do that.
Sometimes when I'm drinking,
I'm like,

61
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.960
I'm sure man,
this is my third drank.
It just doesn't seem to be working.

62
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:37.510
And then I hit it harder and then,
um,
I don't remember anything.

63
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.130
Brownout or blackout or drugs or do drugs.
Yeah.
Actually,
one of the,

64
00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:44.770
one of the first times I heard one of your podcasts,
I think it was,

65
00:03:44.771 --> 00:03:45.820
it was about DMT.

66
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:46.813
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

67
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.120
That's the motherlode DMT is the psychoactive ingredient that's in Io Osca.

68
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.270
Right,
right.
The most potent.

69
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.860
<v 1>That seems like a cleaner,</v>

70
00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.280
cleaner way to do it as opposed to Iowasca where are you?

71
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.240
<v 0>Yeah.
Throw up and shake yourself.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
You,
it's definitely probably,</v>

72
00:04:03.241 --> 00:04:06.360
uh,
it's also quicker,
you know,
like the worst,

73
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.730
the longest it's going to take a sec,
15 or 20 minutes,

74
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.520
but there's some places that are doing it now with they're doing it

75
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:17.190
intravenously.
So those trips are apparently,
that was how they did it in,
um,

76
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.300
there's a book called Dmt,
the spirit molecule molecule by this guy,

77
00:04:21.301 --> 00:04:24.780
Doctor Rick Strassman who did all these studies out of the University of New

78
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.670
Mexico.
And uh,
they were the first FDA approved clinical studies.

79
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.500
Um,
but it was a group of people.
Yeah.
Awesome.
It's amazing.
It was amazing.

80
00:04:34.501 --> 00:04:39.120
But they didn't intervene the intravenously yeah.
And they were gone.

81
00:04:39.121 --> 00:04:42.210
So for like 40 minutes,
like pull them off into the,

82
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.130
off into the other dimension.

83
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.610
<v 1>I was going to say,
so other dimension,
right?
This dream state is,</v>

84
00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:48.880
what do you think is like a dream state?

85
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.650
<v 0>Uh,
it's very similar because they believe that your brain during heavy rem sleep</v>

86
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.010
also produces DMT.
And they think that's okay because we all have it.

87
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.870
Everybody has it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Everybody has recurring and everyone,
yes.

88
00:05:01.871 --> 00:05:04.390
It's produced by your liver,
your lungs,

89
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.380
and now they know it's also produced at least in rats,

90
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.710
by your pineal gland,
which is literally your third eye.

91
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.210
It's it actually in certain reptiles,
it actually has a retina and the Lens.

92
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.000
Yeah.
Yeah,
it is.
It is an eye.

93
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.920
I'm always trying to decalcify my Pineo Glenn,
is that real?
I don't know.

94
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.000
You get that from them crystal people in Sedona.
Yeah.

95
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.770
They say it's like fluoride.
Fluoride is calcifying your pineal gland,
man.
Like,

96
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.840
okay,
cool.
Getting in there.

97
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.120
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

98
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.210
<v 0>Getting through my mouth and I said,
are you sure?
Are you sure Florence?</v>

99
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.300
Because everything you are what you eat sordo but are you what you drink wine?

100
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.620
<v 1>Yes.
Yes.
I get better with age.
Duh.</v>

101
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.540
<v 0>Yeah.
I don't know if you've really,</v>

102
00:05:54.541 --> 00:05:58.100
your pineal gland actually gets calcified by fluoride in drinking water.

103
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.910
<v 1>I didn't.
That sounds like some hippie horseshit.
It does sound hippie horse shit.</v>

104
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.510
I'd like to see some scientific proof,
but hey man,
with all the hippy shit,

105
00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:07.880
there's not a lot of scientific proof with it.
No,
no.

106
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:09.920
There's not the sense of knowing.

107
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.410
That's what it comes down to is a sense of knowing,
like,

108
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.030
do you really feel like this is making sense to you?
Does it register?

109
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.030
And you're like,
I don't know why I believe this,
but I just do.

110
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:20.990
I don't even know where it came from.

111
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.660
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
