00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:05.010
Her low freak bitches at a video.
But you,
so Eddie,
what do you,

2
00:00:05.011 --> 00:00:09.260
you don't think that like t rex is a real,
do you really that when you look,

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.090
when you look into,
uh,
when dinosaur bones or first to Scotland,

4
00:00:13.091 --> 00:00:16.260
a marijuana meme that says,
when you look into dot,
dot,
dot.

5
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.170
When you're looking at the timeline,
it wasn't just like,
oh,

6
00:00:19.171 --> 00:00:22.290
all dinosaurs were discovered.
There was a timeline.
There was a lot of,

7
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.860
there was a lot of fraudulent shit that was dude's like,
hey,
look what I found.

8
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.220
There's not bitch.
That's just a whale bond that I fuck never getting paid.

9
00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:33.060
There was a little of fraud going on in the 18 hundreds when they were

10
00:00:33.061 --> 00:00:37.050
discovering the birth,
but was that,
what about like the,

11
00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:41.220
the way the earth is like the layers and you can tell certain time periods from

12
00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:44.550
the layers of the stratus?
Well,
if you're talking about carbon dating,

13
00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:46.620
there's a lot of science that goes back and forth.

14
00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:49.210
Like it ain't shit or it's real.
Oh,
it's not the job.

15
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.470
The most universally acknowledged a carbon datings effective.
Okay,

16
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.550
well not the stuff that I'm looking into.
I don't know.
I looking on youtube,
man,

17
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.900
don't take my word for
this shit.
Be Crazy.

18
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.740
Chase your tail with this shit,
man.
No,
I'm not.
I'm having fun,
entertaining,

19
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.590
and really love it.
He loves figuring out how we're being bullshitted is very,

20
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.610
I'm obsessed with it.
They bullshitting us.
I love that.
See,
I like

21
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.120
people like this.
I think this is a crazy idea.

22
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.330
I think we're being lied to about fucking everything.

23
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.790
Your Kid's going to grow up just saying skeptical.
Fuck out.

24
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.190
I'm already telling him.

25
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.940
I'm already telling him don't trust anything you see on TV.
I'm Martin though.

26
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.330
We don't let him watch TV.
Let them watch a little cartoons here,
here,
here,

27
00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:41.280
and there.
A little bit.
Bunch Bob's corrupt as,

28
00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:45.030
but I'm going to raise him not trusting TV.

29
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.490
You know I don't give a fuck what anybody says.
You can't.

30
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.150
You can't say nobody would ever disagree with that.
That is,

31
00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:57.540
TV is not good for kids.
Not good for kids.

32
00:01:57.541 --> 00:02:00.550
Why don't you have a show on the Alex Jones Channel?
What has happened?
I agree.

33
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.450
What the fuck?
I went total retard on them.
I wouldn't full flat earth on them.

34
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:14.490
No,
no,
no,
no.
Most,
most,
most conspiracy,
most conspiracy,

35
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.870
they think flat earth is the most retarded thing ever.

36
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.740
When Joe first just correct when Joe first brought it up about a year,

37
00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:25.050
year and a half ago,
he said,
dude,
he was trying to,
he was,

38
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.290
he was trying to basically say how stupid people are.
He said,

39
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.530
do you know if people still believe the earth is flat and the sun is 3000 miles

40
00:02:31.531 --> 00:02:33.570
away?
And I remember sitting there thinking,
shit,

41
00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:37.980
that what are the Amish or something like how dumb do have to be to connect the

42
00:02:37.981 --> 00:02:41.030
world?
That slash no nothing.

43
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.580
And then you brought it,
you brought it up again like maybe six months later.

44
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.420
And I,
and I said,
and I said,
on your podcast,
I said,
that's got it.

45
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:55.030
That is so dumb.
That's gotta be some kind of CIA Cya.

46
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.160
It's going to be some kind of disruption.
Go Weird left.

47
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.310
And then I was in class and one of were,
we were talking about conspiracy

48
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.830
<v 1>theories and my f,
my buddy Manny,
full blown conspiracy,
they shift to cleanse us.</v>

49
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.940
He goes,
do you ever do have my Jujitsu class?
He goes,

50
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.530
we're talking about my youtube class.
I was conspiracy class.
No God,

51
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.150
you go to school teachers.
I teach and I know that

52
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.990
people had to kill a
bright man.

53
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.030
He turns me.
Cause did he ever look into flat earth?

54
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.030
This was like eight months ago or something and I said when he said that,

55
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.470
he said that you ever look into astronomy.
Yeah.

56
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.880
Right when he said Danny did you must fourth grade,

57
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.320
right when he said that I dropped you on your head,
I,

58
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.530
I locked.
I can't believe anything that ever comes out of his mouth again.

59
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.390
That's what I stopped my Jesus and I'm like,

60
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.610
please don't ever bring this shit up again.
You keep that shit dude.

61
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.530
Cut to do that.
Since the turn around,
another guy comes,

62
00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:53.950
I'm telling you the story.
And then,
and then earnest comes up to me and he goes,

63
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.570
hey man,
you ever look into flat earth?
Jesus,
God Damn Christ.

64
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.040
And he goes,
hey man,
I got a master's in engineering,
look into it.

65
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.130
And I just wanted to go.
I just went home and I was just going to,
how about them?

66
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:08.530
Under what fucking school that was.
We didn't tell people

67
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.230
Phoenix online and shit like,
hey man,
shit know I'm so crazy.

68
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.390
I so don't believe anyone else to do I.
I tried to,

69
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:23.240
I tried to debunk it.
I was trying to debunk it.
I was Mr Donkor,

70
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.180
there's a fucking Japanese satellite that takes a photo from $22,000 worse

71
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.820
commodities.
Japanese though,
even if the pixel is all fucked up,

72
00:04:33.821 --> 00:04:38.821
those pictures put up the Japanese pictures from 22,000 miles away.

73
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.970
You remember pictures?
Do you remember when you bought the phone?

74
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.140
I can't remember when you got a flip phone dude and you,

75
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.560
you're the front facing cameras were always dog shit always,
you know,

76
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.290
on the back face he won.
It was pretty legit.
Yeah.

77
00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:55.300
That's how it works for 22,000 miles away.

78
00:04:55.301 --> 00:04:59.020
It's a hard to take that iPhone seven have you ever seen a picture of it?

79
00:04:59.021 --> 00:05:03.280
Hold on.
Hold on.
No,
I didn't say that.
The crazy thing,
I'm not saying it's flat,

80
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.950
I'm just look into it.
I'm saying we don't know what the fuck wrong.

81
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.350
Wait a minute,
Eddie.
This Japanese satellite,
hold on.
Eddie.

82
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.610
This Japanese satellite that all these hundreds of scientists worked on,

83
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.570
they take the moon land picture every 10 minutes and you can download it from

84
00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:27.180
the website.
So Gi composites,
so constantly making CGI in some sorts of,

85
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.450
some sort of a cognitive bank somewhere.
Contact.
They do it in NASA.
NASA.

86
00:05:31.451 --> 00:05:34.990
That's what they do.
Why do you think they have the technology to make CGI?

87
00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:39.890
That looks that good.
Why don't they have the technology in the space?

88
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.830
What's the pictures from Massa?
How come they don't have any,

89
00:05:41.831 --> 00:05:44.680
they don't have that space.
Kind of that kind of a technology.
No,

90
00:05:44.681 --> 00:05:47.330
they just never did it.
They also don't give a fuck about proven.

91
00:05:47.331 --> 00:05:51.110
That's round shadows pictures.
I've seen him show me.

92
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.470
Show me a real quick,
listen.
NASA does not have one of those satellites.

93
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.160
Why do you think that's fair?
Why does it look?

94
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.820
It looks like it looks like something you'd see in a movie.

95
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.460
That's because when they do it in a move,
they try to make it look like this,

96
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:07.580
which is what it looks real.
If that's real team and you don't think it's real,

97
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.330
they faked six moon.
Moondance stop saying that because it's irrelevant.

98
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.180
We're not talking about,
looks like it looks fake to me.
Eddie.

99
00:06:13.181 --> 00:06:17.630
That's 1969 we're talking about 2017 so you think there's some gigantic

100
00:06:17.631 --> 00:06:21.080
conspiracy involving the Japanese government where they put up a fake picture of

101
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:24.440
the Earth from 22,000 miles up every 10 minutes.

102
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.840
High resolution,
downloadable photo.
Why wouldn't it be your real,

103
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:30.260
what?

104
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.730
Isn't it just as likely that the Japanese actually did launch that thing in this

105
00:06:33.731 --> 00:06:38.360
space?
Why would it be fake propaganda,
man?
He cared that it's stays there.

106
00:06:38.361 --> 00:06:42.320
A photo of this flat earth.
No,
I don't.
I like I just said again,

107
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.230
there's is there's phone,
there's no photo of,

108
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.390
of the flat earth from space.
There's no photo of the round earth.

109
00:06:50.391 --> 00:06:53.130
That's not true.
That's not true.
All felt those.

110
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.380
Why do you say they're fake though?
It's CGI,

111
00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.830
but you're not an expert in imagery.
It looks fake to me.
Convince you though.

112
00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:04.670
When I watch Avatar to be an expert,
to know what's tar.

113
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.670
Advertise at the movies and you watch some ridiculous Kung Fu video beat a

114
00:07:10.671 --> 00:07:11.690
martial arts expert.

115
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.450
If you were sitting next to someone that told you that their Sensei can't

116
00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:16.280
compete in the UFC because they're too deadly,

117
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.670
when you get pissed off because you're an actual martial arts expert,

118
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.540
that's just like you with no science background whatsoever.

119
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:28.140
Talking about photos,
I know crazy like that.

120
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.840
I'm crazy,
but why not indulge at all?
It's crazy.

121
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.690
Why not indulge the full realm of possibilities and not clean to the conspiracy?

122
00:07:35.691 --> 00:07:39.920
Every single time
NASA can get pictured,
they've been,

123
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.130
they've been doing CGI composite but pleasing this whole question.

124
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.190
I forget about stating what NASA does.
Please answer my questions.

125
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.950
Why do you always go towards the conspiracy?

126
00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:53.000
Why do you never consider the possibility that maybe they're not the same
people?

127
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:54.600
So everybody's lying.

128
00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:59.960
All the spit European space agencies like all in on it.
It's a global thing.

129
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.650
I think all governments,
uh,
most of them,

130
00:08:03.651 --> 00:08:07.130
the globalists are all working together to,
to control there.

131
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.000
What's the advantage?

132
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:16.790
What's the advantage?
That it's not round.
If they control you,

133
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.990
Bro,
fuck with [inaudible] keep you on up.
There's,
I don't know,
man.

134
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.350
I don't know what it doesn't make sense.
Why wouldn't they make sense?

135
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:27.040
Why he just controlled by,
in a sense you could find the sentence.

136
00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:30.800
The real is that you put them on a ball because again,
I'm crazy.

137
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.130
You put them on a ball.
My guesses.
You're on a ball.
You're nowhere.

138
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.890
Don't try to go anywhere.
Just stay down in the,
Oh hell no.

139
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.620
We sat down and said,
you know what?

140
00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:45.950
We've got to release some fake math that shows that you can demonstrate that the

141
00:08:45.951 --> 00:08:50.240
earth is round.
We've got to release patch earth from space.
What does that,

142
00:08:50.241 --> 00:08:52.250
we just looked at one at.
He stopped saying it is fake.

143
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:54.620
You don't know that it's fake,
but you're saying look,

144
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:58.590
it's a real problem when you say,
but don't say that.
Just stop.

145
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.480
Just stop and think because you're,

146
00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:03.180
you're communicating to millions of people and you're saying something that

147
00:09:03.181 --> 00:09:06.900
doesn't make any sense.
It does make so you don't know anything about imagery.

148
00:09:06.901 --> 00:09:09.600
You don't know anything about what?
You don't know anything about that.

149
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:10.500
It looks fake to me.

150
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.970
You don't have come on and you're just looking at it with the naked eye.

151
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.950
It looks real to everybody else in this room.

152
00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.750
Someone that I with a confirmation bias.
Crazy,
right?
No,

153
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.130
I don't think he made sure he was having fun with it.

154
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:27.510
But you don't direct inclination to always go towards a conspiracy.

155
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:32.820
Does it keeps your opinion?
It's a disservice.
That's what you think.

156
00:09:32.821 --> 00:09:36.380
Cool.
It doesn't have to like you're getting angry.
No,
I'm not getting any at all.

157
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.720
The stoners,
stoners,
I'm like,
I don't believe that shit.

158
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.360
I'm not raising my voice when I'm trying to do is corner your ideas.

159
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:45.750
I try to corner your ideas because you're saying these things to you very

160
00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:48.180
influential and you saying these things to millions of people,

161
00:09:48.181 --> 00:09:51.540
but I don't think you're thinking correct.
I'm telling,
I know.

162
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.480
That's why I've stated many times that you're crazy.
But here's the bottom line.

163
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:59.460
When you use it,
when do you think you started losing it?
I think I was,

164
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:03.780
you know,
as soon as I found out when I was 11 that everybody wasn't Catholic.

165
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.200
That was,
that's when I started losing my,
wait a minute,
I'm like,

166
00:10:07.201 --> 00:10:09.360
everybody's not Catholic.
I thought everybody was Catholic.

167
00:10:09.361 --> 00:10:12.270
There's other religions and how do we know we're right?
There's a bunch of,

168
00:10:12.271 --> 00:10:15.240
what's a Jew?
Oh Shit,
there's more Jews and Catholics.

169
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:19.480
How do we know we have the right religion?
I'm like,
okay,
yes.

170
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:21.390
That's when I started going Chris.
So funny.

171
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:26.840
People to question authority are usually looked at as crazy conspiracy theorist.

172
00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:31.650
The CCIO coined the term conspiracy.
You're a smart dude yesterday.

173
00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.980
There's a problem in the way you approach these things cause you approached them

174
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:38.910
all knowing before you even start that there are conspiracy and telling you
what.

175
00:10:38.911 --> 00:10:42.330
So that's confirmation bias.
I'm telling you,
hey dude,
when you lie so much,

176
00:10:42.331 --> 00:10:44.760
you've got to prove it to me.
Utilize so God damn much.

177
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.310
I'm never going to be saying the things that a defense,

178
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.930
but you don't hear what I'm saying.

179
00:10:48.931 --> 00:10:52.470
The thing I the prosecuting attorney with solid time.
That's what I'm saying,

180
00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.980
but it's not a good analogy because it's exactly how I look at.

181
00:10:55.981 --> 00:11:00.960
Filled with lies allows governments,
governments,
uh,
on uh,

182
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.820
being accused of lying.
I understand

183
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:10.620
they're in court and the government,
not the government.
Oh,
whoever,
whoever.

184
00:11:10.621 --> 00:11:14.490
Just in general scientists,
it's all government scientist.
You think scientists,

185
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.200
you think there's these independent scientists come.

186
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.380
It's all government scientists that I'll try to,
why would she?
Grants are all

187
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.350
the control.
You don't think,

188
00:11:22.351 --> 00:11:27.351
you don't think the globalists aren't control having control the science and

189
00:11:27.601 --> 00:11:31.650
information since day one was like a new thing there.
Name the globalists.

190
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:36.420
They'd be like,
yeah,
it's flat.
It's flat enough.
Fuck,
these guys are globalists.

191
00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:38.670
None other global.
This is what it's called.

192
00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.490
Eddie slipped me if we just spent like a day to get there.

193
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:45.060
I think he just tried to have fun.
Hey,
I'm just having fun man.

194
00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:50.100
I like finding I get is I don't trust shit and coming from the government.

195
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.520
Does that make me crazy?
You know the problem problem is this idea

196
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.360
<v 0>of the government.</v>

197
00:11:55.361 --> 00:11:59.610
The government consists of a bunch of individual science agencies.
Eddie,

198
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.330
you know they have score fighting.

199
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:04.480
Do you know like the CIA and the FBI go after each other.

200
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.350
There's no one governments,
a lot of personal shit going on in between of course,

201
00:12:08.351 --> 00:12:09.940
but it's not just personal shit.

202
00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:14.080
There's a bunch of different factions that you call the government and the idea

203
00:12:14.081 --> 00:12:16.300
that it's all like the government can't be trusted.

204
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:18.090
I just say that cause I'm not gonna.

205
00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:20.350
I mean you want me to pick out some agencies got NASA.

206
00:12:20.351 --> 00:12:24.730
I could pick out some sadness deck but just in general in general,

207
00:12:24.731 --> 00:12:28.870
it's history,
science,
education,

208
00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:33.880
energy.
Everything has always been controlled by the government.

209
00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:38.680
Since day one,
radio has been used as propaganda since the day it was invented.

210
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:43.360
You think some independent dude just invented radio and then he started

211
00:12:43.361 --> 00:12:47.680
broadcasting that like his favorite music and shit and he what his thoughts?
No,

212
00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.720
it was the government from day one and radio.

213
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:54.340
It was the government in all countries from day one in uh,
uh,

214
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.090
TV and the movies.
It was the,
it was all radio,

215
00:12:58.091 --> 00:13:01.600
TV and the movies.
You remember always been about propaganda.

216
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:04.150
Always in every country.
It's nothing new.

217
00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:07.630
It's old school gangsters are countries the most,

218
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:12.480
what does this have to do with the world?
This is this,
this,
this is how gangster,

219
00:13:12.481 --> 00:13:17.020
ah,
are,
are,
uh,
government is,
there's a,
there was a war on drugs.

220
00:13:17.021 --> 00:13:20.080
We started wanting drugs.
Turns out we're bringing it in.

221
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:24.490
Then there's a war on terrorism.
Turns out how do we create it?
Al Qaeda.

222
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:28.510
You understand why I'm crazy.
I'm crazy because of that shit.
I'm like,

223
00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.440
you could believe that shit.
You want to believe that shit.

224
00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.770
You just apply this to everything.
It basically,

225
00:13:35.771 --> 00:13:38.410
anything comes from the government.
Anything coming from the government.

226
00:13:38.411 --> 00:13:40.570
Dinosaurs don't come from the government.
Just,

227
00:13:40.571 --> 00:13:44.380
there's so much fraud when you look into government scientists.

228
00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:49.060
Let's get into it.
Look into it,
but I have looked into it.
Look,
this is,
you could,

229
00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:52.910
you could go over these different sessions of the earth that look here,

230
00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.370
we can look at the next one that comes 10 minutes later.

231
00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:57.720
Maybe you won't think that one's fake.
Like,
Oh wow,
that one's kind of right.

232
00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:58.563
It's all fake.

233
00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.810
It doesn't look fake to me it looks like what the fucking earth probably looks

234
00:14:01.811 --> 00:14:05.020
like when you're 22,000 miles away to you.
It does not to me,

235
00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:09.150
but can we agree to disagree?
Yeah,

236
00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:14.020
but why think that it does?
Because I don't trust shit.
Why think that?

237
00:14:14.021 --> 00:14:17.950
I don't trust the government does make these fake pictures of the earth.

238
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:21.160
Don't you think that would be like we could speculate.
You want to speculate?

239
00:14:21.161 --> 00:14:23.050
I mean I could show you.
I want to hear your spectrum.

240
00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:25.720
It's easier to control people when they're on a ball.

241
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:27.940
I've been trying to tell people that forever.
I don't know.

242
00:14:27.941 --> 00:14:30.130
Like we got to live in a ball.
I told it to my wife.

243
00:14:30.131 --> 00:14:31.570
It's a bit easy to get the kids to listen.

244
00:14:31.571 --> 00:14:35.430
I've just slipped on a ball from his house.
Bull Shit.
I Dunno.

245
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.160
I Dunno what to believe.
That doesn't even make any sense.

246
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:42.970
Why would it be easier to get people to listen to throwing a ball rather than

247
00:14:42.971 --> 00:14:46.150
their fun a plate?
Because if there's more land,
people going to want to work,

248
00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:49.540
there's actually more land shit.
What do you mean it's more land?
It might,

249
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:52.310
who knows if if you,
um,

250
00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:56.300
<v 1>exactly,
what are you talking about?
I don't understand what you're talking about.</v>

251
00:14:56.301 --> 00:15:00.980
Like more or less.
If the world is flat and the flat earth model is true,

252
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:02.570
what's the point of it?

253
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:07.630
What's the point of so all the math is fake on the earth is going 24 hours in a

254
00:15:08.601 --> 00:15:13.470
circle.
Is that all fake?
That it spins and it was miles an hour?
I don't,
uh,

255
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:16.700
when you look at a stationary,
haven't screws.
There's,

256
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:18.650
if you look into the experiments,

257
00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:22.160
if you look into the experiments to prove that the earth is spinning,

258
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.510
all of them failed.
Look into it.
We've been indoctrinated him.
No,
no,

259
00:15:26.511 --> 00:15:29.980
that's not true.
That's not true.
Okay.
I'm crazy.
I get it edited.
Well,
Jamie,

260
00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.600
<v 2>just,
I don't have the science in my head to back it up yet,
but that's not true.</v>

261
00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.360
You can't say things like that.
That's what Eric Dubay says,

262
00:15:36.361 --> 00:15:39.990
and he's not backing it up.
Where's the evidence that find the evidence?

263
00:15:39.991 --> 00:15:43.980
There are kids in high school right now that can show you the evidence with

264
00:15:43.981 --> 00:15:47.940
science if you can't show it to me because I'm not in class right now and I'm

265
00:15:47.941 --> 00:15:50.070
not up to date.
I'm doing jre work.
Right?

266
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.250
<v 1>Okay.
You're talking about some middle weren't on camera.</v>

267
00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.820
You're talking about some shit,
but he,
you're saying I don't trust it.

268
00:15:55.910 --> 00:16:00.170
You're saying something that people have been proving for hundreds and hundreds

269
00:16:00.171 --> 00:16:04.510
of Nicholas Mickelson Morley experiments.
That was,
uh,

270
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:09.290
Einstein said it himself.
Einstein said to this day,
Einstein said,
don't worry,

271
00:16:09.291 --> 00:16:13.070
no proof that we're moving.
Do you guys just have them do it?
That's all it is.

272
00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:17.810
There's a difference.
You'd look into it and watching youtube videos.
So,

273
00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:21.410
so let's say this,
okay,
so one gal channel,
okay?

274
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:25.160
What if it's true that Albert Einstein said,

275
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:30.120
there is no evidence that the earth is spinning.
What did he say?
He said course.

276
00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.240
You said,
that's not true.
I saw it on Youtube,

277
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.060
but what if we find out that it is true?
Then what?

278
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:38.990
What if they find out leprechauns are really but fucking genius.

279
00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:43.060
I thought that was,
I mean that's what I said.
So you're saying,
Oh,
do you really

280
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:49.370
look at what maybe a 1947 there wasn't much evidence of the Earth is spinning

281
00:16:49.371 --> 00:16:50.870
because it didn't understand it yet.
Okay.

282
00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:54.320
When we're talking about something that happened more than a half a century ago,

283
00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:58.130
Einstein is,
look,
he compare all the people that are alive today,

284
00:16:58.131 --> 00:17:03.050
whether it's Lawrence Krauss or Stephen Hawking's,
most famous field experiment.

285
00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.520
<v 2>That's the mic.
What does it morally experiment?
It was under,</v>

286
00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:08.860
couldn't recreate it.
It was an 1880s I looked this up when I was watching him.

287
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:13.800
Listen to what he just said.
Exactly.

288
00:17:13.801 --> 00:17:17.100
You keep using that.
Look at the Mickelson Warley experiments I did.

289
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.510
I ran up the information on it.

290
00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.240
It's an experiment that was supposed to be able to be recreated.

291
00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:23.340
It was not able to be recreated.
So you,

292
00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:27.990
that evidence is used by flat earth supporting people.
Like you just said,

293
00:17:27.991 --> 00:17:31.420
like go look it up.
Go look it up.
Look it up.
Repeatable.
You can't repair it.

294
00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:33.490
You don't understand.
That's what you're saying.

295
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.390
I'm trying to tell you that that's the evidence you're trying to say.

296
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.480
If they save the experiment showed the earth

297
00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:42.400
<v 1>is not spinning,
no one can reproduce that experiment.
That's why it's not real.</v>

298
00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:47.620
So this thing that you keep repeating is bullshit and this thing that you keep

299
00:17:47.621 --> 00:17:51.270
her but don't.
No,
no,
no.
Did you get this Information Jeff?
Jamie,

300
00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:54.450
where'd you get it?
When I get what?
This information,
what does this come from?

301
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.580
This is coming off the Internet.
Exactly.
American.

302
00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.350
So I'm reading some information.
I'm reading some men.

303
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:05.160
Go to the library
sources here.

304
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:07.020
There's a book called the American Journal of Science.

305
00:18:07.021 --> 00:18:11.490
I'm sure that which is bought and paid for it.
Well,
maybe it is.

306
00:18:11.491 --> 00:18:14.760
It's awkward.
It's part of the Washington Post.

307
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.890
Why would anybody be paying money for people to lie about the world's

308
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:22.680
very good question that everybody asks coming in.

309
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:27.040
Everybody off the group have a seat.

310
00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.690
They're not,
they're not huge.
Not getting knocked down.

311
00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:36.720
That's why we just read this thing that you've been siting and you didn't even

312
00:18:36.721 --> 00:18:39.300
understand it when we were reading it.
You read off the Internet.

313
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:43.770
That's how I read it.
I don't have any books here.

314
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.540
We're both getting our information off the Internet.

315
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:51.500
So you were saying is peer reviewed journals from science,

316
00:18:51.501 --> 00:18:54.520
from American journal offense.
Come on.

317
00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:56.973
That's like,

318
00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:03.180
so you think it's more likely more likely that everyone is in on it and lying

319
00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:04.140
than it is.

320
00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.020
One guy doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about and it makes a youtube

321
00:19:07.021 --> 00:19:11.130
video and you get convinced and it's attractive to you because it seems like it

322
00:19:11.131 --> 00:19:13.350
would be an amazing conspiracy to be ahead of,

323
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:17.340
and you get trapped in the fucking rabbit hole and you'd go down to flat earth

324
00:19:17.341 --> 00:19:20.310
rabbit hole and you find yourself defending things with experiments you don't

325
00:19:20.311 --> 00:19:21.150
even understand,

326
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.680
which means you just let some shit that he pulled up off the internet and I know

327
00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:29.190
you like all over it.
I know you didn't understand it twice.
It doesn't matter.

328
00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.100
But I understood it and he had explained it to you twice and you didn't

329
00:19:32.101 --> 00:19:34.830
understand that you were our,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
This is the proof of,

330
00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:39.610
now I understand there was an experiment to prove that the earth wasn't moving

331
00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:43.930
and lead them and then they,
and then they proved it,
but it won't.
But no,

332
00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.950
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I get,
they didn't prove it,

333
00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.980
but that doesn't mean that it's spinning.
Oh,
Jamie,

334
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.790
I'm sure you can find some evidence of the Earth is spinning.
Eddie.

335
00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:54.600
People who have known it's spinning forever.
That's how you,

336
00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.960
that's how the seasons,
where would he be?
Happy.
You see the sun we spin around.

337
00:19:57.961 --> 00:19:59.580
That's why it makes a claim this to this.
Why we,

338
00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:01.320
that's where you can track time zones.

339
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.440
That's where he could put a piece of stick in the ground and it after seeing all

340
00:20:04.441 --> 00:20:08.400
the connections that it acts as a Sundial,
you're saying,

341
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:09.900
oh the Shit Eddie.

342
00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.290
There's a said there's a fundamental problem with the way you approach these

343
00:20:13.291 --> 00:20:18.150
things.
Problem.
The problem is you do.
It's not that I try to shit,

344
00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:22.500
you know I don't trust you.
I don't.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

345
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:26.150
That's a flat around it doesn't matter.
That's all back.

346
00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.710
You keep saying that it's a bad fallback because what I'm,

347
00:20:28.711 --> 00:20:30.450
what we're saying is there are conspiracies.

348
00:20:30.451 --> 00:20:32.730
The problem is when you think everything is conspiracy,

349
00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:37.500
you act as a cyop guy and you fuck people over that want to look at real

350
00:20:37.501 --> 00:20:41.520
conspiracies because the real conspiracies,
the Gulf of Tonkin.

351
00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:45.240
That's what I thought.
Ticking like the Gulf of Tonkin.
Real,

352
00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:48.850
real like operation Northwoods real things that really happened.

353
00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:51.640
When you look at those things and people explore them,
they go,
oh,

354
00:20:51.641 --> 00:20:53.590
I don't think they really killed Kennedy.
Are you sure?

355
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.480
Why don't you look at this?
Look at this stuff.

356
00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:00.600
There's a lot of really crazy evidence when you start thinking that the world is

357
00:21:00.821 --> 00:21:02.530
flat,
that dinosaurs aren't real,

358
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:07.240
all this nutty shit that you believe and you just jump into it with the problem

359
00:21:07.241 --> 00:21:10.930
is it discredits all these other things that you believe that might be real

360
00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:15.190
because the other things have some validity to that you just haven't looked
into.

361
00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:18.580
That's all Ed.
I used to say the Sandy,
you're talking about the earth being flat.

362
00:21:18.581 --> 00:21:21.400
That was,
I'm saying the same thing.
You can do what you think they're all wrong.

363
00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:25.210
That's so insane.
You haven't looked into it.
I have.
Oh my God.

364
00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.270
How could I not have,
you don't think I have.

365
00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:29.740
I'm watching you go down the rabbit hole.

366
00:21:29.741 --> 00:21:31.630
You don't think I've tried to pay attention to what the fuck these people are

367
00:21:31.631 --> 00:21:33.850
talking about.
It doesn't work.
I don't think so.

368
00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:36.190
At any of there's websites dedicated to debunking.

369
00:21:36.191 --> 00:21:39.100
It is dedicated to showing you the science,

370
00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:42.070
showing you the math that you can detect them.
When you check the Internet.

371
00:21:42.071 --> 00:21:44.230
It's valid,
but when I'm on the Internet it's not,

372
00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:48.190
you're not talking about the internet,
you're talking about a guys youtube?
No,

373
00:21:48.191 --> 00:21:51.430
it's an oh guys.
There's a lot of guys.
There's a lot of people,

374
00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:52.293
but they're just youtube.

375
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:57.950
No science behind them is not verified by peer review journals.

376
00:21:58.420 --> 00:21:59.590
The science of the Earth,

377
00:21:59.591 --> 00:22:03.550
the Saudi government science that's bought and paid for.
Of course,

378
00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:07.960
you start talking about this,
so you just have third is flat.

379
00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:11.200
I didn't say that.
I said,
I dunno if it's flat or round.

380
00:22:11.201 --> 00:22:15.880
When I see a picture of earth from space,
what we're sitting on from space.

381
00:22:15.881 --> 00:22:18.250
When I see a real picture,
then we'll have the proof.

382
00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:20.380
I'm just saying we don't even have nerves going.
It's round.
No,

383
00:22:20.381 --> 00:22:23.430
we're looking at pictures while we're sitting here.
Okay.
You,

384
00:22:23.431 --> 00:22:27.580
you're not even taking into consideration the fact that this is a monitor that

385
00:22:27.581 --> 00:22:28.860
you're looking at this.
You're not.
It's,

386
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:30.610
you don't even get like the high resolution.

387
00:22:30.611 --> 00:22:32.830
I mean they must be gigantic files that they get.

388
00:22:32.831 --> 00:22:35.800
You would never be able to see him and their actual resolution on a regular

389
00:22:35.801 --> 00:22:36.730
monitor in the first place.

390
00:22:36.731 --> 00:22:40.420
You're talking about a photo of the earth photo of the Earth from 22,000 miles

391
00:22:40.421 --> 00:22:41.860
away and they take one every fucking

392
00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:49.120
look CGI to you.
You'd have to jump on a ship.
You know your side could be wrong.

393
00:22:49.121 --> 00:22:51.370
It could be real.
Too many things could be real,

394
00:22:51.371 --> 00:22:52.990
but they've been faking them so much.

395
00:22:52.991 --> 00:22:56.410
They look like all those other fake what's not as good as I've seen so many fake

396
00:22:56.411 --> 00:23:00.280
ones that NASA,
a mitts that they're CGI composites.
There's so many out there.

397
00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.430
So when you see this one,
it's like this is the same one.
Yeah,

398
00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.880
but facing so many people,

399
00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:06.670
and this is the [inaudible] composites is different when you can pay.

400
00:23:06.671 --> 00:23:10.570
I don't believe that.
Eddie,
please,
when you take one of these photos,
these,

401
00:23:10.571 --> 00:23:13.660
what are those calls?
When you fucking do that,
when you do that,

402
00:23:13.661 --> 00:23:15.220
you know what that is?
That's a composite.

403
00:23:15.221 --> 00:23:17.760
You're taking a bunch of photographs and they piece them all together.

404
00:23:17.761 --> 00:23:19.120
It makes one enormous photo.

405
00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:23.590
When you see these photos from space of the earth from a closer saddle,

406
00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.660
not the NASA one that Jamie just pulled up,

407
00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.570
which does show a full full size image of the earth.

408
00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.520
What you're seeing is they take a photo,

409
00:23:30.521 --> 00:23:32.200
they take it on the front and they piece them all together.

410
00:23:32.201 --> 00:23:36.480
There's no scenes him composites?
No,
no.
There's an actual CGI.

411
00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:41.800
Put them together,
get colors,
everything in Eddie,

412
00:23:41.801 --> 00:23:46.100
is this CGI it question for you,
is this CGI because it's con,

413
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.210
<v 2>it was made in a computer and it fits the definition of computer generated image</v>

414
00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:55.400
because that's the composite one could easily mean made this,
I'll show you.
No,

415
00:23:55.401 --> 00:23:58.550
no,
no.
I'm just saying,
but this could easily a real picture,

416
00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:01.920
but it is a real picture.
That's not a hard picture.

417
00:24:01.921 --> 00:24:05.960
Where I wasn't sure of earth from space where I physically was on the ground in

418
00:24:05.961 --> 00:24:08.360
New York City and take that with the camera I was using.

419
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:12.560
That building would not fit in my lens.
I wasn't far enough away,

420
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.450
but that's not what they're saying they're doing.

421
00:24:14.451 --> 00:24:17.210
They're saying they take strips.
That's what,
that's what they're saying they do.

422
00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.200
They're saying,

423
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.650
I'm going to show you a video of the artists who actually did the latest one.

424
00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:25.850
They go,
oh NASA,
here's the guy who did the latest.
Tell us what to look at it.

425
00:24:25.851 --> 00:24:26.684
Let's watch a video.

426
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:31.690
Just put NASA artist a CGI picture of earth and you're going to hear him talking

427
00:24:33.041 --> 00:24:35.540
and he says it did his Photoshop.
It is,
it is Photoshop,

428
00:24:35.541 --> 00:24:36.710
but it has to be fought a shot.

429
00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:40.690
He says that word for word because it's so massive asking you to,

430
00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:41.960
I would ask you to clarify that.

431
00:24:41.961 --> 00:24:44.090
I'm trying to tell you that that's what I literally had to do.

432
00:24:44.091 --> 00:24:49.091
I had to have been farther away to get the photo in one photo of that giant

433
00:24:49.161 --> 00:24:49.994
building,

434
00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:54.350
but that where I have in order to get that distance away coloring with CGI,

435
00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:57.050
there were buildings in the way.
You're saying that it in Photoshop.

436
00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:59.960
I put it into Photoshop.
He's going through the video going,

437
00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:03.320
I got it cause I got up.
I was,
sometimes I put green shades here and I kind of,

438
00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:05.450
I'm not an astronaut,
I never been to space,

439
00:25:05.451 --> 00:25:08.890
so I have to kind of use my imagination to taking black whites

440
00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:12.230
that NASA releases of earth.

441
00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:16.520
Here's the latest one like this that day that's a little exaggerated.

442
00:25:16.521 --> 00:25:18.350
The dark weren't that dark in real life.

443
00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:21.350
The brights aren't that bright and real life.
So yes,
I added color to it.

444
00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:23.860
I did some artistry to it,
but that's bull shit.

445
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:26.690
So we got the fucking building looks like.
Oh,
okay.

446
00:25:26.691 --> 00:25:29.600
Now find that the CGI artists,

447
00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:34.430
do you believe anything?
I believe shit that I can prove for myself.

448
00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.770
Like I believe the science in like a skyscraper,

449
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:41.480
skyscraper it standing there.
That's true.
But how am I believe in that?

450
00:25:41.481 --> 00:25:44.690
How much have you looked into like the science of space travel?

451
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:48.380
How much have you looked at how much work was done to try to put satellites into

452
00:25:48.381 --> 00:25:51.920
orbit?
So you'd think we went to the moon.
That's not what I asked you.
I said,

453
00:25:51.921 --> 00:25:56.900
how much did you look at the,
he answered my fucking talk.
Ridiculous.

454
00:25:57.010 --> 00:26:01.820
So he's trying circle you talking in circles.
They're ridiculous conversations.

455
00:26:01.821 --> 00:26:03.800
Everything is the government,
the government,
the government,

456
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:07.610
the government's fake pictures.
Why don't just ask you a question.
Punch up NASA.

457
00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:12.530
CGI artists.
Picture of earth.
I don't see that up there.
The head.
He's so crazy.

458
00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:16.400
Which one would you like me to click on?
Any of them?
That one right there.

459
00:26:16.401 --> 00:26:20.000
The second one right there.
I mean,

460
00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:24.110
that's just listen to him talk.
Okay.
Steering has 20,000 well,

461
00:26:24.111 --> 00:26:25.100
it's going to get more now.

462
00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:31.940
Today I want to share with you this article.
Are we allowed to play?

463
00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.830
This guy isn't a scientist.

464
00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:36.710
Are we listening to him or the the guy that made the video,

465
00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.310
you said we're gonna listen to a scientist.
Well,
I forgot what it looked like.

466
00:26:40.311 --> 00:26:44.010
The right video.
I don't know.
Look at the guy that is the artist and

467
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.730
<v 0>he has,
this is the,
that's a picture of the video.
He's talking to him,</v>

468
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:52.530
talking about how he created the latest picture of earth for NASA.

469
00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:54.120
They're celebrating

470
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:56.630
<v 3>Goddard.
It's from the Goddard webpage.</v>

471
00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.520
So he's doing a recap of something that's written on the God or webpage,

472
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:03.540
so go to the God or webpage,
find that guys page Robert and Photoshop.

473
00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.760
<v 0>There it was and we'll see what he's actually saying.</v>

474
00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:11.173
Is that it?

475
00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:13.613
<v 3>Picture?</v>

476
00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:15.980
What do you think is the most interesting that your role here at Goddard?

477
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:17.840
How do you help support God's mission?

478
00:27:17.841 --> 00:27:21.710
My role is to make imagery from earth scientists,
sciences data.

479
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:23.360
I turn data into pictures.

480
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:27.650
I looked for new interesting events and Natalie NASA satellites have seen or

481
00:27:27.651 --> 00:27:30.860
that are hidden in the latest data to anything interesting that shows off.

482
00:27:30.861 --> 00:27:34.250
NASA is unique capabilities.
Finding things is the fun part.

483
00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:38.270
I rely on engineers and scientists to produce the data.
They're reliable.

484
00:27:38.271 --> 00:27:42.850
Real time stream of 1.7 terabytes a day.
Holy Shit is incredible terabyte.

485
00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:46.760
The same as producing 3000 cds a day.

486
00:27:46.761 --> 00:27:51.350
We know where to look for the interesting stuff because each instrument provides

487
00:27:51.351 --> 00:27:55.400
a very specialized type of information.
So if I'm looking for something specific,

488
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:57.050
I know where to look.
For example,

489
00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.270
recently there was a volcanic eruption in the Red Sea.

490
00:27:59.271 --> 00:28:01.700
The only reliable imagery of this was from NASA satellites.

491
00:28:01.701 --> 00:28:06.020
We basically confirm the existence of a new island.
Okay,
so where's the,

492
00:28:06.021 --> 00:28:08.840
let's get to some Photoshop shit.
The one where he's talking.
Okay,

493
00:28:08.841 --> 00:28:10.460
but this guy's talking about science here.

494
00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:12.650
Like some of the sites have to be real,
right?
Eddie?

495
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:16.310
Like there has to be some subtle,
it's like direct TV.
Direct TV's not fake,
right?

496
00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:20.950
<v 0>Um,
I don't know.
I don't know.
But you could do all that with landline stuff.</v>

497
00:28:20.951 --> 00:28:23.940
You don't need to go bounce anything from space.
You could do a lot with my,

498
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.861
<v 3>wouldn't you?</v>

499
00:28:24.861 --> 00:28:27.710
You could just put it in space and it just broadcast and shoot it up there and

500
00:28:27.711 --> 00:28:29.090
shoot it back.
Why would you lie about it?

501
00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:32.670
<v 0>That means there's a ton of fucking space junk.</v>

502
00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:39.750
They satellites,
faith for satellites.
No pays for satellites.
The taxpayer,
they,

503
00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.570
they get bills.
We need nude telecommunication satellite.

504
00:28:42.571 --> 00:28:45.470
We got to throw it up there.
So you don't need $35 million don't think.

505
00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:48.720
And they go,
yeah,
okay,
we're going to sign it.
They get the money to tax scam.

506
00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:52.860
You don't think satellites are real?
I don't think so,
but Jesus Christ,

507
00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.080
I don't think so.
Well,
what's happening?
What about,

508
00:28:55.081 --> 00:28:57.450
what are those things up there that you can watch from the ground?

509
00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.360
Have you ever seen the space station fly overhead?
You can see it.

510
00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:02.640
They can take pictures of it.

511
00:29:02.641 --> 00:29:04.260
The time that they told me it was going to be overhead,

512
00:29:04.261 --> 00:29:06.810
I took a picture of it and everyone was in a high altitude plane.

513
00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:10.110
What's the difference?
Why would they do that?
Why would they lie?

514
00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:15.480
Why would they pretended to space?
How high do airplanes go?
30,000 feet.

515
00:29:15.481 --> 00:29:20.010
Right now they can go hire 50 plus commercial airplanes on average,

516
00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:24.270
I think just somewhere in the thirties 30 35,000 right when you're on the
ground,

517
00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.540
you could barely see it when they're at 30,000 feet,
barely fucking.

518
00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.640
When you're in therapy 30,000 feet and you look down,

519
00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.910
you wouldn't be able to see a god damn.
It's true bus or a plane.

520
00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:37.200
Now those satellites are supposed to be like hundred miles up.

521
00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:40.640
Think about that because they're in space and there are light.

522
00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.220
There are small pinprick

523
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.830
<v 3>of light that moves across the sky.
You could see him with optics.
Okay,</v>

524
00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:45.960
do you want it?
Okay,

525
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.280
but you really haven't looked and you definitely haven't looked with optics.

526
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.260
If you look with like a big spotting scope,

527
00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:52.850
these people get these telescopes and they look up and they know exactly what's

528
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:54.940
going to be.
You can actually program it into the telescope.

529
00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:58.030
There's things that you can download where you could find the coordinates of

530
00:29:58.031 --> 00:29:59.680
itch in the each individual planet.

531
00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:03.220
The way these really super powerful telescopes use amateur astronomers like to

532
00:30:03.221 --> 00:30:03.660
use.

533
00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:08.290
You Punch in the key numbers and it'll move specifically to a spot in the sky

534
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:13.470
where you can tune into the moon or tune into Saturn or into very specific areas

535
00:30:14.231 --> 00:30:17.500
of the cosmos that change all the time because of the fact that the earth is

536
00:30:17.501 --> 00:30:20.080
spinning.
We're catching all sorts of different shit all,

537
00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.510
all sorts of different times.
Especially no matter where you are,

538
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:25.780
if you're on the equator,
you're looking at a totally different image,

539
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:28.540
you know at one moment in the sky,
then you are the next moment.

540
00:30:28.541 --> 00:30:32.020
So it can tell you exactly where the space station is going to be,

541
00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:34.060
where the moon's going to be,
where Mars is going to be,

542
00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:37.750
and they punched these coordinates into these little computers and they all move

543
00:30:37.751 --> 00:30:42.100
to this thing.
You believe the Marvel Mars rover,
Israel,
man,
Eddie,

544
00:30:42.101 --> 00:30:45.700
I don't think I'm going to do this anymore because it's just like I don't see

545
00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:49.330
why.
First of all,
I don't see the money.
Hold on a second.

546
00:30:49.331 --> 00:30:53.470
I don't see where the money is to have all these hoaxes that you don't see the

547
00:30:53.471 --> 00:30:56.300
tax scam with Dalit Rovers and they get the,

548
00:30:56.340 --> 00:31:00.490
they just got nine NASA got $19 billion,
uh,

549
00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.610
for Trump.
Gave him $19 billion.

550
00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:08.080
What tells any possible so that they can actually make a rover?
Tell me what,

551
00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:11.350
tell me what the space shuttle has done for humanity.

552
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:14.620
Tell me all that money that was wasted on spacial and then they just trashed it.

553
00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.200
They went up,
I don't know how many times and then they just trashed it.

554
00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:21.970
I don't tell me how all those billions of dollars has helped humanity.
Tell me.

555
00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:22.780
Well,

556
00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:27.780
I think scientific innovation is very important to us because in our minds we

557
00:31:28.031 --> 00:31:31.960
constantly want newer bed,
better,
more innovative technology.

558
00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:35.290
Just a part of being a person in the 21st century what everybody wants.

559
00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:36.970
Everybody wants a new computer,

560
00:31:36.971 --> 00:31:40.660
everybody wants new things and a lot of this new stuff comes from NASA

561
00:31:40.661 --> 00:31:41.321
technology.

562
00:31:41.321 --> 00:31:45.400
It comes from all the science and innovation that's goes names part of me.

563
00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:50.470
There's a list right there,
but why do you say this when you don't look into it?

564
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:55.710
I just love telling highway safety down [inaudible] that how can we can caddy

565
00:31:56.651 --> 00:31:57.081
but the,

566
00:31:57.081 --> 00:32:02.081
the massive requirements that you have on the gear when you're talking about

567
00:32:02.171 --> 00:32:06.790
going through fucking space,
the insane stress of reentry,

568
00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:10.360
they figured out all kinds of crazy shit that speed and which you land.

569
00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:14.020
They figured out a bunch of crazy shit and rich baby food,
I mean portable,

570
00:32:14.021 --> 00:32:17.770
cordless vacuums,
freeze drying technology.
All this comes from space.

571
00:32:17.771 --> 00:32:20.830
There's a shit load of things that they figured out.
Harnessing solar energy.

572
00:32:20.831 --> 00:32:24.970
There's a lot of innovation that comes from the development of either the space

573
00:32:24.971 --> 00:32:29.890
station or the shuttles or a bunch of different things that they've invented and

574
00:32:29.891 --> 00:32:31.420
they continue to innovate these things.

575
00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:34.570
These new satellites they're shooting out in the space are way better than the

576
00:32:34.571 --> 00:32:38.410
Hubble.
They keep doing more and more,
better and better.

577
00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:41.960
And it's this constant rush to see who can get to the,

578
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.860
the furthest point of technology in whatever field they're in,

579
00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:49.610
whether it's the field of rocketry,
whether it's the field of satellites,

580
00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.900
there's this massive amount of competition between the top scientists in the

581
00:32:53.901 --> 00:32:54.734
world.

582
00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:58.610
And to think that that's all fake doesn't make any sense because there are some

583
00:32:58.611 --> 00:32:59.480
things that are fake.

584
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.980
So why assume that all of this technology is fake when you really could see the

585
00:33:03.981 --> 00:33:07.520
challenger,
you saw the challenger explode in the sky.
If it's fake,

586
00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:11.360
no one was there to engineer the shit that failed.
Who said that was fine?
Well,

587
00:33:11.361 --> 00:33:14.630
any of it,
any of it,
any space travel,
because this place is going up.

588
00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:16.080
It's still high altitude.
You know,

589
00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:19.520
the space shuttle goes up and they work on fucking satellites.

590
00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.860
I do know that the space station is the video that

591
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:30.320
maybe hit it.
They do this.
The problem is,

592
00:33:30.321 --> 00:33:34.910
is a lot of these things that you just automatically want to fake six moon

593
00:33:34.911 --> 00:33:39.530
missions.
Dude,
of course I don't trust show Colin females.
Even if that was true.

594
00:33:39.531 --> 00:33:44.010
Those are people in 1969 did not the same humans.
Uh,
so some people,

595
00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:45.500
they're not the same human beings.

596
00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:50.330
That's just like saying that the people who made the movies in 1969 are the same

597
00:33:50.331 --> 00:33:53.720
people that made fast and furious.
Eight is that they make the movies.

598
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:56.300
They're not the same people.
They're totally different humans.

599
00:33:56.450 --> 00:34:00.020
It's like saying the standup comedians from 1969 were the same as the one that

600
00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:03.110
was [inaudible] 69 they fake six moon missions.

601
00:34:03.111 --> 00:34:05.330
How am I supposed to believe those are not the same people?

602
00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:07.790
Even if that was true,
there's not the same people in rich.

603
00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:10.310
Richard Nixon isn't alive anymore.
He just write them all off though.

604
00:34:10.311 --> 00:34:14.350
Eddie to to me,
I don't need to believe,
but don't need to believe it.

605
00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:18.140
How's it going to add on?
Believe it.
But if it's true,
I don't give a shit.
Okay?

606
00:34:18.141 --> 00:34:21.560
It's true.
Oh,
that's true.
Okay,
but you got to prove it to me.

607
00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:23.930
Otherwise the problem isn't die handled.

608
00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:29.570
The problem is there's no proven it and you want to always assume that it's
fake.

609
00:34:29.571 --> 00:34:33.080
You don't have like this empty,
prove it to me.
Like I'm not assuming either way.

610
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:36.910
You're assuming it's fake.
Every time they fake six moon missions,

611
00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:37.671
it doesn't matter.

612
00:34:37.671 --> 00:34:40.760
These are not the same people living in a different type of people.
They want,

613
00:34:40.761 --> 00:34:42.710
they're not going to understand the logic.

614
00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:47.330
The logic is just because someone fakes something one point in time before you

615
00:34:47.331 --> 00:34:48.380
were alive,

616
00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:53.740
doesn't mean that those same human beings ever managed to download their brains

617
00:34:54.021 --> 00:34:56.360
and everybody that ever did that job for the rest of time,

618
00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:57.890
because they're not the same humans,

619
00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.400
but so that he'll be the scientists that are today,
the generations later,

620
00:35:01.401 --> 00:35:04.970
whether it's NASA or these Japanese scientists or the Russians,
the Chinese,

621
00:35:04.971 --> 00:35:07.340
whoever the fuck is putting satellites and rockets into space,

622
00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.700
they're not the same people from 1969 okay.
You can't like look at him.

623
00:35:10.701 --> 00:35:13.160
It's like in one ad,
one blanket organization can't,

624
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:17.740
I can't blame NASA in 1969 [inaudible] NASA,
uh,

625
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:19.220
Warner von Braun at Nazi.

626
00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:24.280
I can't blame today's NASA for all the lies from,
is that what you're saying?

627
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:25.940
From the early seventies?
I'm saying,

628
00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:29.400
do you believe that the space shuttles were real?
No,

629
00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:31.660
I do believe the space shuttle.
Why?
Just that?
Yeah.

630
00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:36.610
Why that I've saw plenty of video of them landing and just man,

631
00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:38.070
and that's it.
And everything else

632
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:41.640
<v 0>is bullshit.
No,
they made the Saturn five rockets and they launched him.
Okay,</v>

633
00:35:41.641 --> 00:35:44.100
so you don't know where they go into orbit when the orbiter,

634
00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:47.010
I don't know how high,
how high people are going.
I don't know.
I'm not sure.

635
00:35:47.011 --> 00:35:49.230
You don't know?
I know they're going high,
but I don't know how high.

636
00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:53.010
So why would you assume that any of it is fake?
They fake six moon missions.
Okay.

637
00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.880
You keep saying that.
No,
but that's why.
Yeah,

638
00:35:54.881 --> 00:35:58.170
but we're talking about the same people at ea,
but that's,
but it doesn't matter.

639
00:35:58.171 --> 00:35:59.550
It's the same organization.

640
00:35:59.551 --> 00:36:04.551
The problem is turned them into VA as soon as you say they but did not know.

641
00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:08.730
Let me,
let me ask you a Brendan,
do you see that?

642
00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:14.180
How I can't trust NASA because even though it was different people in 1969 to

643
00:36:14.551 --> 00:36:19.551
1973 even though the p the massive today aren't the ones that fake six moon

644
00:36:20.771 --> 00:36:24.990
missions and stole billions of dollars from American taxpayer just because the

645
00:36:24.991 --> 00:36:29.010
guys from today,
somehow they got weeded out and then NASA,

646
00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.620
I don't know that they got weeded out in a,

647
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:35.070
NASA became this honest agency of the government,
but I don't know that.

648
00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:38.950
I'm going to assume,
I'm going to assume no,
I think you're,
you're,

649
00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:42.960
it's still part of the sandy.
I could be wrong.
I could be wrong.

650
00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:46.350
Let's say those six missions were all bullshit and it was fake.

651
00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:49.470
You're going off the exception,
not the general rule.

652
00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:52.170
So it's like me coming into your academy and some guy's a dick.
I'm like,

653
00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.000
all those 10th planet guys are Dicks.

654
00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.700
Like you're just lumping all them in the same fucking,

655
00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.480
that was a big shit though.
Wasn't like side project mass employees.

656
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:04.530
This is no,
I understand you saying the same thing he said.

657
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:08.890
He's saying that just because,
dude,
that was,
you don't seem to move soon.

658
00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:14.080
So gigantic and so global and the greatest achievement of mankind and they don't

659
00:37:16.891 --> 00:37:20.370
even have the records anymore.
Joe,
you know what I'm talking about?

660
00:37:20.371 --> 00:37:23.220
We're talking about this earlier,
man.
You were talking about this early.

661
00:37:23.221 --> 00:37:25.770
You know all that moon imagery data's missing.

662
00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:30.600
They had an awesome video says,
he says,
yeah,
we don't have it.

663
00:37:30.601 --> 00:37:34.290
It's missing or maybe it's stolen,
but even if we did had an asset,

664
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:39.240
even if we did have the tapes,
we don't have the machines to play him anymore,

665
00:37:39.241 --> 00:37:42.240
so it really doesn't matter.
Come on man.
Come on man.

666
00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:47.380
At the dumbest retard detective on the planet would would be suspicious.

667
00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:51.900
That just like mission,
but you can't just lump all,
oh,
it's all bullshit.

668
00:37:51.901 --> 00:37:53.880
Then anyone with the most,
you want to see something,
Brendan,

669
00:37:53.881 --> 00:37:56.040
it'll make you think this is the most suspicious thing.

670
00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:59.640
One of the weirdest things about the moon landing is the post flight press

671
00:37:59.641 --> 00:38:04.020
conference.
Have you ever seen it?
It's really weird.
It's real weird.

672
00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:08.880
That would make sense.
The conspiracy hippos,
skeptical hippos.

673
00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:11.720
What the fuck is going on?
You guys are open to the doctor.

674
00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:13.290
Maybe they faked it because now you're going,

675
00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:17.010
you're open to the fact that maybe I,
maybe they did fake that,

676
00:38:17.011 --> 00:38:18.060
but you can't just lump,

677
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:22.200
and I'm saying the greatest achievement of man,

678
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:29.110
we got new people now.
Come on,
man.
That's hilarious.

679
00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:35.250
How can,
can you see how I can't trust shit from asset
that

680
00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:38.710
<v 1>maybe they would,
they they,
they,
you know,</v>

681
00:38:38.711 --> 00:38:42.530
all those bad people have died and there are old and the new NASA there,

682
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:45.550
the good Massa,
they can't all get to believe that

683
00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.140
there was an agenda or believe in a guy on youtube.

684
00:38:50.141 --> 00:38:52.090
It says the world's flat and dinosaurs aren't real.

685
00:38:52.091 --> 00:38:54.220
What's better if that was mom's space like that,
it's,

686
00:38:54.221 --> 00:38:56.350
there's a lot of people saying [inaudible] all those guys.

687
00:38:56.351 --> 00:38:59.170
There's a lot of people in mental institutions,
a lot of people in jail.

688
00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:02.410
So how do people that are child molesters?
There's a lot of racist people.

689
00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:03.263
Those people,

690
00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:06.910
if you gave every racist person a video camera and put made them a youtube
video,

691
00:39:06.911 --> 00:39:09.000
you'll be like,
oh,
have you watched all fit with racists?

692
00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:12.950
Have you watched history of flat earth by Eric?
Can I see that?

693
00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:17.890
How long is it?
Oh No,
don't have an hour for that.

694
00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:23.520
You're asking for from
their side.

695
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:28.210
What does Eric do?
Band in
fourth grade.
My teacher.

696
00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:30.490
I know what you don't care and that's fine.

697
00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.620
I'm not going to be mad at you for not caring.
Of course.

698
00:39:32.621 --> 00:39:34.110
Don't be mad at me for carrying.
Then

699
00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:39.790
you don't look into what scientists,
why you getting mad?

700
00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:42.810
Cause you don't look into what scientists say.
You don't.

701
00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.860
You just automatically dismiss them all this.
Correct.

702
00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:49.620
Is this fair to say the reason why you care so much about Eddie believe in this

703
00:39:49.621 --> 00:39:53.260
shit and you know Eddie going on crazy cause he said he influences a lot of

704
00:39:53.261 --> 00:39:56.860
people and you enough for yourself.
Look for the truth.

705
00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:00.580
Look into it like uh,
like you're investigating and just look into both sides.

706
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:04.130
There's a reason why it's becoming huge.
There's a reason.
Yeah,

707
00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:06.250
because people don't really go to school.

708
00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:11.170
They don't learn astrophysics,
they don't study all these things.

709
00:40:11.171 --> 00:40:14.800
It's hard to learn the bay.
The entry barrier is fucking huge.

710
00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:17.500
If you want to study physics,
you want to figure out how to,
I can't,

711
00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:19.860
I can barely pay attention to it.
I listened.

712
00:40:19.861 --> 00:40:22.060
He's books on tape and I have to go back over him three,

713
00:40:22.061 --> 00:40:24.460
four times just to understand a paragraph.

714
00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:27.070
Try to figure out exactly what the fuck they're quantifying.

715
00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:30.340
They're talking about really intense shit that thousands of people who've been

716
00:40:30.341 --> 00:40:33.520
working on in conjunction,
they all feed off of each other's innovation.

717
00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.530
There's so many people working on these things.
Eddie,

718
00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:39.970
the idea that they're all in on some sort of a giant global lie is insane.

719
00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:45.510
Yeah.
That's what everyone thinks.
Okay.
There's no,
I mean that's,

720
00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:50.320
there's no
history of flat earth looking,
doing no.

721
00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:53.200
Definitely no.
Why?

722
00:40:56.090 --> 00:40:58.960
I don't watch game of Thrones,
game of Thrones.

723
00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:05.380
I don't watch breaking bad and better call Saul.
Nope.
What do you watch?

724
00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:09.760
I watch real shit like first 48 and you're not talking about a show,

725
00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:14.380
but if you watch his game of Thrones,
he knows it's fake.
It's fake.

726
00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:18.910
It's fake.
But you don't,
I,
I'm just having fun.
What do you think?

727
00:41:18.911 --> 00:41:19.750
Is the earth flat around?

728
00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:23.050
I don't know if it's flat or round until we see a picture from space.

729
00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:26.930
They're saying this bitch could be squared around.
It could be what?

730
00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:32.140
Full ABC camera with fish.
I fish.
I bet you guys are fooled by the Fisheye Lens.

731
00:41:32.141 --> 00:41:34.030
C'Mon man.
Was plenty

732
00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:36.800
<v 3>of pictures without the fish.
I had legs.
Did you could find this fish</v>

733
00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:41.420
basic ass kindergarten.
Do you understand perspective?

734
00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:45.200
I do understand that high.
If you didn't have a fish eye lens,

735
00:41:45.201 --> 00:41:47.330
you're looking at this tiny fraction of the surface.

736
00:41:47.331 --> 00:41:51.980
The reason why they do some 1946.
How do you know that's real?

737
00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:56.900
Because it's a picture.
I read it on the Internet.
That's why I know

738
00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:09.500
Eddie,
would you be open to talking to you?
That's real.
I don't care.

739
00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:13.550
Would you be looking in to talking to an actual astrophysicist?
Yes.

740
00:42:13.551 --> 00:42:15.860
I would love to.
Like what would you do if Neil degrasse Tyson was here?

741
00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:17.960
Same arguments,

742
00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:21.560
but would you listen to him like you've yet to be told you some shit that

743
00:42:21.561 --> 00:42:24.320
actually made sense or what'd you just think?
He's a Pardot.

744
00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:29.870
I round Earth Society.
I think.
Uh,
he's um,
you know,

745
00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:33.890
there's people that they push to be the spokespeople and there's really

746
00:42:33.891 --> 00:42:36.950
brilliant people that are good at talking and their educators like him.

747
00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:38.960
And then they get on television and people love it.

748
00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:42.510
And so he comes back and then he does a hit show called Cosmos or reenact the

749
00:42:42.511 --> 00:42:44.720
Carl Sagan show.
And everybody loves it.

750
00:42:44.721 --> 00:42:47.930
And more people understand science now than ever before because he breaks his

751
00:42:47.931 --> 00:42:51.050
heart.
Eddie,
you know,
it's hard because you got to go to school for this.

752
00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:55.050
I'm not mad,
but look,
I love you man.
I love you.
You know,
I'm just done.

753
00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:56.210
I'm just trying to,
I want to,

754
00:42:56.211 --> 00:42:58.520
I want to be able to talk about flat earth and have fun cake,

755
00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:01.760
but it's not fun for me because I think there's some 16 year old kids out there

756
00:43:01.761 --> 00:43:04.520
that are listen to this and they think he makes sense.
And the problem is the,

757
00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:06.530
what's wrong with that?
Who cares about,
because those poor kids,

758
00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:10.880
what's happened here?
Me Am I am I,
my life is going to wasting time.
No,

759
00:43:10.881 --> 00:43:14.740
it's heavy.
You're wasting time.
You fucking come on.
Come on and he'd do it.

760
00:43:14.741 --> 00:43:17.330
All this shit.
They do waste time.
You would consider a waste of time.

761
00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:21.110
If someone was all in poor Paul and he was obsessed with poor,
you would say,

762
00:43:21.111 --> 00:43:23.560
you're wasting your time.
What are you getting out of?
When I hit those walls,

763
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:27.170
they're real.
They're real.
I hit those balls to go into the whole,

764
00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:31.610
it takes skill and concentration and I,
it gives me something to occupy my mind.

765
00:43:31.611 --> 00:43:34.550
It's a game.
It's a mind game and it's a body game.

766
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:38.150
When you're watching a fake video that guy made about,

767
00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:42.530
you think it's fake nuclear bombs not being real.
It's fake.
Hmm.
Okay.

768
00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:46.550
That's what to think.
Okay.
I mean,
I just feel like,

769
00:43:47.410 --> 00:43:49.140
<v 4>oh no.
The</v>

770
00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:54.140
<v 3>people that study it at all the universities have come to a conclusion and then</v>

771
00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:57.570
one guy makes a youtube video or 20 guys,

772
00:43:57.571 --> 00:44:01.080
they're saying a thousand Santos Bonacci why did,

773
00:44:01.081 --> 00:44:05.280
why would you listen to them versus stability freaks,

774
00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:08.690
generations after generations of studying the science behind it.

775
00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:12.060
We're comfortable science repeatable.
Right,

776
00:44:12.061 --> 00:44:16.320
but you just told us about this one test and you parroted it out as some sort of

777
00:44:16.321 --> 00:44:20.070
a theory that we should look up and when we did it turns out it didn't even
work.

778
00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:24.300
It wasn't repeated.
You okay,
whatever.
Eddie,
I love you,

779
00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:27.810
but I don't like the way you approach these things sometimes because I think it

780
00:44:27.811 --> 00:44:32.100
confuses the fuck out of people like I was when I was young.
I was

781
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:35.730
<v 2>super gullible.
I believed all kinds of stupid shit and I wasted a ton of time.</v>

782
00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:40.590
Like what?
Especially with successful guys,
all these goddamned Ufo people,

783
00:44:40.591 --> 00:44:44.090
man,
all those I'll Yulia Ufo stories I bought and all that.
She never got the,

784
00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:47.430
have you ever heard of the law of perspective?
Yes.
No,
that's not real.

785
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:50.190
That's not a law went about it.

786
00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:53.120
It's that that's the deaf they're giving the definition of what perspective is.

787
00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:55.980
No,
it's a law perspective is,
I'm trying to tell you though real quick.

788
00:44:56.370 --> 00:44:59.190
There are laws of conservation of energy and such in physics.

789
00:44:59.191 --> 00:45:03.000
There are actual laws that they can be translated without even speaking
language.

790
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:06.840
It's math.
The law perspective is not one of those,

791
00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:11.400
what is it?
Tell me.
It's just,
it's just a definition of perspective.

792
00:45:11.401 --> 00:45:16.140
I'm asking you what the law,
what is it?
Cause it's not really,
well,

793
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:20.420
maybe,
maybe.
So you're saying there's no uh,
love.

794
00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:25.420
I'm saying it's not a law like gravity.

795
00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:30.450
It's a definition of the word perspective.
That's not a law.
Well,

796
00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:34.590
the laws of perspective are the Herat one of the loss she has.
No,

797
00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:38.880
there are no horizon of perspective.
Our real high level,

798
00:45:38.881 --> 00:45:43.470
that's eye level.
That's not how it always happens.
It always happens.
Not a law,

799
00:45:43.471 --> 00:45:47.030
but it always happens.
It's the law.
If it happens,
that's not a law.
That's,

800
00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:50.310
this is where you don't understand part of the laws of science.
That's not a law.

801
00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:55.290
That's a definition.
Okay.
And then finishes,
what is the definition?

802
00:45:55.291 --> 00:45:59.310
Definition of a noun.
It's a person,
place thing or idea.
That's not a law.
Okay.

803
00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:03.030
That's just the definition.
Okay.
Okay.
You know what else is,

804
00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:07.830
I used to call this double lotus for years and years and years.

805
00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:10.440
And it's not double lotus.
It's full load.
It's not a lot though.
Right.

806
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:13.890
But it's not,
it's not double loaded snow a,
it's not double load.

807
00:46:13.891 --> 00:46:15.390
So that's what you're saying.

808
00:46:15.391 --> 00:46:18.880
You're talking about a different word for the same moves.

809
00:46:18.881 --> 00:46:23.881
They move what he's saying perspective Stephanie Shot Better because,

810
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.540
okay,
hold on.
It's the same thing because of whatever you call it.
God,

811
00:46:29.541 --> 00:46:32.670
Allah or you want,
well when you look up this stuff online,

812
00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:35.220
I try to type in the law perspective cause I wanted to see what your,

813
00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:40.280
what you and Eric Dubay believe that that is the only thing I ever find with the

814
00:46:40.531 --> 00:46:42.690
law perspective is the words flat earth with it.

815
00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:45.690
Or maybe there's actually the urban dictionary has a,

816
00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:47.640
has a different definition for now.

817
00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:51.000
What does it matter if it's law but it's not a lot.

818
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:55.320
Definitely say matters but that,

819
00:46:55.410 --> 00:46:59.070
but if the horizon always rises,
not lie level,

820
00:46:59.071 --> 00:47:04.020
that's not a lot though for that up.
Uh,
uh,
what would you call it then?
Um,

821
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:07.140
you don't believe in gravity though of perspective.

822
00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:08.310
I don't believe in gravity either.

823
00:47:08.311 --> 00:47:11.780
That falls at a constant of 9.8 meters per second.
That is a,

824
00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:15.600
that's a law of gravity.
Gravity is a theory I had not,
no,
no.

825
00:47:15.601 --> 00:47:18.300
You guys have a theory of what gravity is.
Density,

826
00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:19.950
but that's another scientific word.

827
00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:23.130
You guys said that if it's more dense it falls,
but why does it fall?

828
00:47:23.310 --> 00:47:27.150
Why was it fall over?
If it's deserts heavier than,
why is it heavier?

829
00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:31.620
Do you know what?
Cause it's tense.
We're only shortfalls.
Helium.

830
00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:36.190
Hocoma helium gas.
Helium was a gas.
We're only heavy.
Lighter.

831
00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:40.540
Then it's the oxygen.
It's lighter.
It's less dense.

832
00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:43.810
I'll explain it's lighter because we're in the atmosphere of earth.

833
00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:47.140
Isn't it less dense than if we were in space?
There is no atmosphere.

834
00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:51.070
That's why everything floats.
Gases and us were dense too,

835
00:47:51.071 --> 00:47:54.880
but we would float in space just like get floods.
We got into space.

836
00:47:54.881 --> 00:47:58.240
You're correct.
If we got out there,
so can we not go to space?

837
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:59.620
I don't know how far we can go up

838
00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:03.000
<v 3>the space station.
You said the space shuttle went into orbit.</v>

839
00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:06.750
<v 2>I don't know how far it went.
How high.
I don't know where it went,</v>

840
00:48:06.751 --> 00:48:10.620
but I know it took off.
Saw that and then I see it landing.

841
00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:15.540
You see that more?
I went on a plane,
right?
For sure.

842
00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:18.090
Are you not confused on what laws and stuff science are though?

843
00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:21.540
Do you not see that?
Okay.
We'll call it definition,
but what do we call it?

844
00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:24.080
But that's not,
what did we call it?
We'll call it whatever you want.
In science,

845
00:48:24.081 --> 00:48:26.910
we call things laws.
We don't call them definitions and science.

846
00:48:26.911 --> 00:48:31.600
There are laws because?
Because so what is that?
That law,
which is most of them

847
00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:37.440
called most cases,
it's math.
Hold on.
In most cases it's math,

848
00:48:37.441 --> 00:48:39.870
the law so that that math,

849
00:48:39.871 --> 00:48:44.700
then that formulaic equation can go to any country and work.

850
00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:46.980
I don't need to speak English to the guy in Germany.

851
00:48:46.981 --> 00:48:49.110
That to explain to them what I'm trying to get out of it,

852
00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:51.270
he can test it with the same things,

853
00:48:51.271 --> 00:48:53.340
the same variables and get the same thing out of it.

854
00:48:54.090 --> 00:48:56.730
That's why all these things are laws.
Not Definitely.

855
00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:01.550
Thank you for clearing that up permit.
Does that work?
Do you accept that or no,

856
00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:06.750
<v 3>but uses verbose terminology because it makes them appear smarter than they</v>

857
00:49:06.751 --> 00:49:08.400
really are to make some cross.

858
00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:12.360
No Eddie and they tried to say it in a fancier way because they really didn't go

859
00:49:12.361 --> 00:49:15.210
to school for this shit.
So they say a bunch of shit that's not real.

860
00:49:15.211 --> 00:49:19.350
Like the law of perspective and it's not a law and it belies the real problem.

861
00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:22.220
They don't have an education,
this stuff,
and they're just talking about of ass.

862
00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:23.760
That's disrespectful,

863
00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:28.260
disrespectful to the fucking generations of people that had been studying that

864
00:49:28.261 --> 00:49:29.094
their whole lives.

865
00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:32.850
That one guy can figure out all these different things that dinosaurs aren't

866
00:49:32.851 --> 00:49:37.680
real.
Nuclear bombs are real,
the earth is flat.
It's ridiculous.
It's ridiculous.

867
00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:40.170
Satellites aren't real.
It's ridiculous.

868
00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:44.290
It's one guy is the smartest person in the world.
Well,

869
00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:47.730
the one guy that one guy that you're pals with,
love that stuff.

870
00:49:47.731 --> 00:49:50.610
That guys got videos on dinosaurs on the fucking earth.

871
00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:53.610
<v 2>Figured it all the time now.
I had him on my podcast.</v>

872
00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:56.280
That's the most money he makes off to flatter it's I'd be interested in,

873
00:49:56.281 --> 00:49:59.220
now that he's writing a lot of books off and a lot of youtube videos,

874
00:49:59.550 --> 00:50:03.310
isn't everybody making money as a NASA making billions?
Well,

875
00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:05.670
he's a guy with a youtube account.

876
00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:10.770
NASA lied six times about the moon missions and I don't believe we could come

877
00:50:11.521 --> 00:50:14.490
back from that.
That's it,
but that's the root of it all,
so don't be mad.

878
00:50:14.491 --> 00:50:18.810
That's why we should understand that.
That's one of that is because of that

879
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:23.990
<v 3>posture's idea available that every photo of the earth is fake and there's,</v>

880
00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:28.160
<v 2>there's no photos,
there's no videos</v>

881
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.930
<v 1>of the composite.
Special video.</v>

882
00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:32.990
Find a problem that there's no photos of the earth being flat,

883
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:37.070
not there's no photos of the earth being round.
There's planning,
there's no,

884
00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:40.940
NASA will tell Nasa will tell you that about CGI artist.
How can we,

885
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.360
how do we skip over that?
I think we can't get any,
NASA can't even get a picture.

886
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:45.380
That doesn't mean that is

887
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:49.490
was never goes back to that for me.

888
00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:54.390
It's like they didn't see anything in there about CGI that that article said.

889
00:50:54.391 --> 00:50:56.740
He puts together data and make the photos.

890
00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:59.540
He puts together data because it has to be interpreted because you're talking

891
00:50:59.541 --> 00:51:03.720
about 1.7 you said [inaudible] video of him talking to the video.

892
00:51:03.721 --> 00:51:06.380
You told me to try it was,
that was the wrong one.

893
00:51:06.381 --> 00:51:10.670
All the fights are a terrible bunch where he's talking terabytes like a thousand

894
00:51:10.671 --> 00:51:14.270
gigabytes.
There's a word for word.
He goes,
well,
it is.
It's photoshopped it.

895
00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:18.490
It's Photoshop.
It has to be.
It's,
it's not,

896
00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:22.820
I don't know shop.
You didn't say it in that article,
but he did.

897
00:51:22.821 --> 00:51:25.110
He did said come out of his mouth.
He's got to find the other thing.

898
00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:26.280
But when you're talking about you don't,

899
00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:29.090
Photoshop doesn't mean that they're distorting the image.

900
00:51:29.091 --> 00:51:32.150
It also can mean that the connecting a bunch of different images to make,

901
00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:37.930
but when you watch him talking about how we put together the official picture of

902
00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:42.200
earth from space,
he's talking about cartoon animation type Shit.

903
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:44.540
He's talking about his own imagination.
Well,

904
00:51:44.541 --> 00:51:49.160
maybe because he's talking about this insane amount of data,
1.7 terabytes,

905
00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:52.700
maybe we don't understand how the fuck that gets interpreted into an image in

906
00:51:52.701 --> 00:51:55.430
the first place.
I don't even know if it's possible to do it.

907
00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:59.270
You know like to have an in perspective when you're looking at it like a 12 inch

908
00:51:59.271 --> 00:52:02.770
screen or 24 inch screen where the fuck your monitor would be and you're going

909
00:52:02.771 --> 00:52:06.470
to take this 1.7 terabyte image and shrink it down so it fits in there.

910
00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:08.660
I don't understand that messed with some shit.

911
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:14.660
That finished product is it admitted CIA,
CGI composite.
It's admitted.

912
00:52:14.661 --> 00:52:19.190
It's not even.
All of a sudden the Japanese got real ones.
The chaplain,

913
00:52:19.191 --> 00:52:23.570
he's got real ones,
but that's again figure it out.
Oh Eddie.
NASA does have one.

914
00:52:23.571 --> 00:52:24.440
That's what the problem is.

915
00:52:24.441 --> 00:52:28.400
They keep saying they don't from 1972 they were saying the only real one that

916
00:52:28.401 --> 00:52:31.400
happens for like two minutes pulled up is up right now that there's pictures

917
00:52:31.401 --> 00:52:35.570
from today that discover when you said throw some pictures.
Okay,

918
00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:38.200
you guys,
it was way cool.
Why

919
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:44.150
six times leaving the space shuttle,
but you don't believe in anything else.

920
00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:45.013
That's where it ends.

921
00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:50.900
Shutter goes up and flies around direct TV.
I don't want it does dinosaurs.

922
00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:54.140
I don't know.
Here it goes.
This is just,
that looks fake as fuck.

923
00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:57.480
April 16 2017 anything.
You guys taught stuff

924
00:53:00.550 --> 00:53:04.370
all the time.
You have to fake ones off.
It looks,

925
00:53:04.930 --> 00:53:07.920
it looks just like the ones that were admitted there were fake.

926
00:53:07.930 --> 00:53:09.080
Let's say that let's stop of thoughts,

927
00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:12.830
but they look exactly like the ones that were admitted.

928
00:53:12.831 --> 00:53:17.510
Fakes where you accepted we was real.

929
00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:20.540
Can I send you to space and like what do you need to fuck with?

930
00:53:20.541 --> 00:53:24.590
You want to see something that's real man.
His ass up.

931
00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:26.133
I see

932
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:29.580
<v 0>a bunch of fake ones in the show me that one I got that looks like all the CGI</v>

933
00:53:29.581 --> 00:53:32.850
ones.
I say I don't believe it.
Let's try to stick this land.

934
00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:39.570
<v 3>Damn,
this is a motherfucker of a pocket.
Jesus.
I worry about Yeti.</v>

935
00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:43.130
I really do.
We don't need to,
man.
I'm fucking group better than ever know.

936
00:53:43.131 --> 00:53:46.400
You have no idea.
I worry about you going down these rabbit holes and thoughts.

937
00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:49.980
<v 0>What's what?
What's the big deal?
Who cares if the earth is round or flat?</v>

938
00:53:49.981 --> 00:53:54.720
It's entertaining to me.
I understand.
So what's the big deal?
Who cares if,
yeah,

939
00:53:54.721 --> 00:53:57.660
if kids start looking into flat earth,
good start questioning shit.

940
00:53:57.690 --> 00:54:00.270
If you look into it and you,
and you have proof that it is around,

941
00:54:00.271 --> 00:54:03.240
instead of going,
oh,
some scientists figured out,
somebody figured it out,

942
00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:07.020
somebody figured out.
But you figure it out.
You try to figure it out.
You know,

943
00:54:07.021 --> 00:54:09.840
the one thing that all we know that we don't need scientists to figure out as we

944
00:54:09.841 --> 00:54:12.690
know a couple of things.
A compass,
a compass points to north.

945
00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:16.170
It doesn't need a battery in it.
If there's no wars.
No,
no,
I know.
Let me,

946
00:54:16.171 --> 00:54:17.850
let me explain it.
This is all we know.
There's all,

947
00:54:17.851 --> 00:54:21.130
we know it's pointing to the north.
There's um,
it's,

948
00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:25.230
it's a magnetic force in the north.
That's all we know that for sure.

949
00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:27.420
I don't need a scientist to confirm that.

950
00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:31.380
I know that there's a force in the north,
some kind of magnetic force.

951
00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:32.393
What else do,

952
00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:37.350
what else don't I need a government scientist confirmation from uh,
uh,

953
00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:40.440
the north star.
It's right over the north end.
We finish,
let me finish.

954
00:54:40.441 --> 00:54:43.650
Let me just finish.
Let me just finish the North Pole.
The North Star,

955
00:54:43.651 --> 00:54:48.651
Polaris is directly coincidentally over the North Pole where all the campuses

956
00:54:49.291 --> 00:54:52.410
are pointing.
All the company companies are pointing to the North Pole.

957
00:54:52.590 --> 00:54:57.150
There's this a magnetic force in the North Pole and coincidence Polaris.
No,

958
00:54:57.151 --> 00:54:59.550
I'm just saying it.
The Polaris is directly over the North Pole.

959
00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:04.770
It has been multiple north stars is Polaris directly above the North Pole.

960
00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:07.170
You know that there's been more than one northstar over the history.

961
00:55:07.590 --> 00:55:10.710
<v 3>Where'd you get that information from?
From the Internet.
Exactly.</v>

962
00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:15.040
So you don't believe that any,
I don't know.
I mean it's Polaris Star,
Polaris,

963
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:19.230
Polaris,
the North Star.
Let me read this please.
Cause you explain right now,

964
00:55:19.231 --> 00:55:23.040
Earth's rotation access happens to be pointing almost exactly a Polaris,

965
00:55:23.041 --> 00:55:27.300
but in the year 3000 BC,
the North Star was a star called through ban,

966
00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:32.520
also known as Alpha draconian and in about 13,000 years from now,

967
00:55:32.521 --> 00:55:37.290
the procession of the rotation axis will mean that the Brightstar Vega will be

968
00:55:37.291 --> 00:55:40.050
the north star.
That's according to NASA.

969
00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:42.540
That's according to every scientist that studies at Eddie from.

970
00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:45.790
How do you know that?
Because that's why it's still a,

971
00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:50.640
how do you know every night?
How do you know?
You just said you don't know list.

972
00:55:50.641 --> 00:55:52.380
There's no dispute about this.
I bet.

973
00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:54.960
I bet he Jamie could pull up 100 different fucking things.

974
00:55:54.961 --> 00:55:56.580
It'll show you the same thing on the Internet,

975
00:55:56.880 --> 00:56:00.060
but it's not just on the Internet and it's okay if you just hit the internet,

976
00:56:00.061 --> 00:56:02.820
but it's not okay if I get information.
It's an information war.

977
00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:04.920
That's what it is.
It's do you get your information?

978
00:56:04.921 --> 00:56:07.890
There's no information on both sides,
but it's okay.
You don't think that's true.

979
00:56:07.891 --> 00:56:11.040
You look it up and now when I look at it,
northstar changes over time.

980
00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:14.820
University of what does that Michigan,
does that make sense?

981
00:56:14.821 --> 00:56:17.380
That doesn't make any,
that's not science.
Why does that not make sense?
No,

982
00:56:17.381 --> 00:56:20.280
I said it doesn't make sense that the Internet only works for you and not

983
00:56:20.281 --> 00:56:23.160
familiar what works when you,
when you keep them looking at it over,

984
00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:24.100
over and over again from

985
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:25.120
<v 0>all these multiple sources.</v>

986
00:56:25.121 --> 00:56:28.540
Wouldn't you just assume you said over and over and over.
You didn't say,

987
00:56:28.570 --> 00:56:31.170
you'd said over and over and over and over,
and then you did.

988
00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:33.610
What are you playing games?
This is like you're playing tic TAC toe.

989
00:56:33.611 --> 00:56:36.370
You're not looking at the truth like a little GI Joe.

990
00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:39.640
If you want to believe NASA after getting all the fakes six,

991
00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:42.090
it's all government side.

992
00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:47.230
I'm telling me then why does that compass point towards the north?
I don't know.

993
00:56:47.250 --> 00:56:51.250
We,
we know.
We know it.
There's a magnetic force in the north,

994
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:53.770
in the magic in the North Pole.
Right,

995
00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:57.850
and we know the Polaris is right over the north pole and the constellations

996
00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.920
rotate around Polaris.

997
00:56:59.921 --> 00:57:03.040
Polaris is a fixed star and they all wrote the constellations,

998
00:57:03.041 --> 00:57:07.120
rotate around that and it's right over the North Pole.
Spent

999
00:57:09.310 --> 00:57:13.890
how much time you've actually spent
explaining what,

1000
00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:17.290
what did I say wrong?
You and Eric Dubay repeat that over and over again.

1001
00:57:17.291 --> 00:57:19.870
Like the sky doesn't change at night.
No,
no,
I didn't know what I said.

1002
00:57:19.871 --> 00:57:22.870
I never said that.
I said,
you said North Star.

1003
00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:27.280
Does the Polaris star stay ahead of the norm over the North Pole?
Yes or no?

1004
00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:31.610
And do the constellations rotate around Polaris?
Nope.
Yes sir.
No Sir.

1005
00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:33.640
Don't rotate.
No,
no.
They spin around.

1006
00:57:33.641 --> 00:57:36.340
When you look at time lapse photography of Polaris,

1007
00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:39.310
you could you go watch the time.
All the constellations gone.

1008
00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:41.530
Polaris is the fixed her.
That's why they can go.
You're not,

1009
00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:44.050
you could find your way around and just find the north star.
It doesn't move.

1010
00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:45.693
Explain that.

1011
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:49.280
<v 3>And if the Earth is spinning like we know it is,</v>

1012
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:53.600
what's directly above the earth would stay the same because the earth is

1013
00:57:53.601 --> 00:57:55.100
spinning faster than spaces.

1014
00:57:55.530 --> 00:57:57.620
Earth is spinning a thousand miles an hour and a circle.

1015
00:57:57.950 --> 00:58:00.620
Even though the cosmos suspending the cosmos changes as well.

1016
00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:02.570
There's a lot of things that change

1017
00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:06.440
<v 0>and the sky looks different all the time.
Change right over the North Pole.</v>

1018
00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:10.480
<v 3>But if you were spinning and you're talking about a small window of time when</v>

1019
00:58:10.481 --> 00:58:12.610
they're taking these time,
life time lapse photographs,

1020
00:58:12.850 --> 00:58:15.640
they're taking over a few hours.
Yes,
but he would do you understand that?

1021
00:58:15.850 --> 00:58:20.050
That if you looking up over a few hours and you have one light that's directly

1022
00:58:20.051 --> 00:58:21.610
overhead and the other ones are circulate,

1023
00:58:21.970 --> 00:58:24.490
the one light that's directly overhead over a few hours is not going to move

1024
00:58:24.491 --> 00:58:27.520
enough to register in the photograph,
but the ones on the sides are,

1025
00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:29.080
when you're looking at a timelapse,

1026
00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:31.060
you're looking at a time lapse over a few hours.

1027
00:58:31.210 --> 00:58:34.360
If you were looking at a time lapse over months or years,

1028
00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:35.860
you would see that thing spinning too.

1029
00:58:36.330 --> 00:58:38.400
<v 0>Polaris would still be on the same spot.</v>

1030
00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:40.220
<v 3>No.
You'd have the procession of the equinoxes.</v>

1031
00:58:40.221 --> 00:58:44.030
It changes the rotation of the earth.
Earth wobbles on its axis.

1032
00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:46.333
They've been tracking that

1033
00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:49.010
<v 0>forever.
You're going to watch time will last photography on your,
on Youtube.</v>

1034
00:58:49.090 --> 00:58:53.090
Do you know you're not listening to one time lapse photography is over a few

1035
00:58:53.090 --> 00:58:57.360
hours and then over a few hours you can see the Earth Connie,

1036
00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:01.010
thousand miles an hour and constellation circling around Polaris.

1037
00:59:01.011 --> 00:59:02.310
That's one motion,
right?
You,

1038
00:59:02.370 --> 00:59:05.870
you capture one motion and that time lapse photography,

1039
00:59:06.050 --> 00:59:09.860
but science is telling us that there's four motions going on.
There are.

1040
00:59:09.861 --> 00:59:11.300
They're just much slower.

1041
00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:14.330
You're talking about something that you're looking at it.
It's very quick.

1042
00:59:14.331 --> 00:59:18.580
Over a very short amount of time,
year after year,
decade to decade.
Polar look up.

1043
00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:21.170
Same spot.
None of these stars are staying in the same spot.

1044
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:23.010
<v 1>You got to find one a polar.</v>

1045
00:59:23.011 --> 00:59:26.480
Why would I pull a specific one that you're looking for?
Find Polaris

1046
00:59:29.950 --> 00:59:31.640
and everything's going around Eddie.
Eddie,

1047
00:59:31.641 --> 00:59:33.230
what are you looking at right there when you see that,

1048
00:59:33.231 --> 00:59:36.430
that time lapse photo spinning,
right?

1049
00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:38.570
The earth and the sky is,

1050
00:59:38.810 --> 00:59:41.300
is this guy spinning or is the earth's what do you think?

1051
00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:44.240
I think the sky spinning.
Jesus Christ.

1052
00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:49.790
Why would people be lying about that?
I think,
I think,
I think
right.

1053
00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:53.150
There's Polaris,
right?
You know why?
Because it's in the center.
Ready?
Yeah,

1054
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:56.150
exactly.
There's always that 32nd picture.
No,

1055
00:59:56.151 --> 00:59:57.580
you talking about something that happens very.

1056
00:59:57.610 --> 01:00:00.110
All those other constellations are moving really quick.
Eddie.

1057
01:00:00.290 --> 01:00:02.840
If it's the ones directly overhead.
Okay.

1058
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:05.810
If you have a ball and you spit it on your finger like Michael Jordan,

1059
01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:10.970
the outside equator of the ball is going to spin like fucking crazy and this big

1060
01:00:10.971 --> 01:00:14.780
long wide loop,
but the tip of the ball is going to spin in a very short,

1061
01:00:14.781 --> 01:00:18.020
tight circle.
Okay.
Right.
When you see the Harlem Globe trotters,

1062
01:00:20.370 --> 01:00:21.570
<v 2>you can test it yourself.
Eddie,</v>

1063
01:00:21.571 --> 01:00:24.750
if you just point a camera in the same spot out of your window for like three

1064
01:00:24.751 --> 01:00:27.800
months straight,
take a photo,
maybe even four or five tests.

1065
01:00:27.830 --> 01:00:28.663
I'm talking about [inaudible].

1066
01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:32.130
We just give you an example to test it for yourself to show you that the stars,

1067
01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:35.160
the stars in the sky that you'll see above your head like you've claimed to go

1068
01:00:35.161 --> 01:00:37.980
out and look out every night will be different throughout the year.

1069
01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:41.960
<v 1>No,
no.
They won't be different.
They're moving.
They are rotating,</v>

1070
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:45.110
the are rotating around.
Polaris not going to be in the same spot.

1071
01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:49.310
Taking the are moving.
Okay.
They are moving,

1072
01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:50.930
but you're always going to see Polaris.

1073
01:00:50.931 --> 01:00:52.760
Why would you think that this is a conspiracy?

1074
01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:56.600
Why would they lie about the earth spinning when it's really the the universe

1075
01:00:56.601 --> 01:00:59.990
spinning or they're not stars trying to control.
I don't know.
What are they?

1076
01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.450
I Dunno.
People,
LEDs.
People looking down.

1077
01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:07.460
GRANDPA happy people,
their souls.
Angels.

1078
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:10.700
You're telling me my grandma's other flying unicorns,
bro.

1079
01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:15.250
Grandma's flying Unicorn came and told you the crazy.
Oh,
you don't do shit.

1080
01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:19.360
None.
No.
Chris,

1081
01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:23.150
the craziest shit can't tell you crazy.
Crazier.

1082
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:25.910
Why save it?
I don't

1083
01:01:28.290 --> 01:01:32.390
have I how already making fun of me for Flat Earth.
I remember I'm trying.

1084
01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:35.120
I just don't,
I just don't trust NASA.
I understand.

1085
01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:38.870
You had a circle of trust or some crazy shit.

1086
01:01:38.871 --> 01:01:43.660
Please promise me end on this
crazy,

1087
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:47.100
crazy t shirt for next time.
Yeah,
just don't make it.

1088
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:54.140
If you drop it now,
we'll never make it out here and cut.
It's six o'clock.
I know.

1089
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:56.890
I just want to,
Oh shit.
Yeah.
Six o'clock.

1090
01:01:58.790 --> 01:02:02.570
Unless,
unless you want to hear it now.
I don't know if should,
it's too crazy.

1091
01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:07.460
It's too crazy.
Let's go do it.
Okay.
Chris taught.

1092
01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:12.050
We'll talk off here about this.
Crazy.
It'll discredit the flat earth theory.

1093
01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:18.260
I can't hit my mind.
Can't handle daddy everything spirit.
I left this one.

1094
01:02:18.261 --> 01:02:20.310
You need a tissue says everything is conspiracy

1095
01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:25.110
<v 3>you make.
You will make Alex Jones look like fucking like Gandhi.</v>

1096
01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:29.660
Fuck yeah.
Like Alex Jones is like Alex Jones,
like 90% of conspiracy theories.

1097
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:33.960
Like,
wow,
that's all bullshit.
You know?
But Eddie,
just these fucking,
yeah,
you,

1098
01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:38.560
you got to appreciate the hustle by adding does lack a bluebell.
Percy Paris.

1099
01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:41.970
You'd have the,
wow.
I can't believe you said that straight.
Let's end on that.

1100
01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:53.680
<v 5>Okay.</v>
