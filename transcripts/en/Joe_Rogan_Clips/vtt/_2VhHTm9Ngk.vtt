1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.430
As a CEO,
as a guy who's running this thing,
what,

2
00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.670
what is this been his experience has been like for you?

3
00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:10.050
Because I got to imagine that it wasn't anything that you predicted.

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.450
No one predicted Twitter,
right?
Yeah.

5
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.230
So to all of a sudden have this responsibility or change it everything.

6
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.630
And you're a young guy,
how old are you?

7
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.310
42 that's young to be in control of that much.

8
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.740
Like what?
And to have it over the time of,

9
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.020
but has it been 11 years or 10 years old?
They're 13 and March hill.
Yeah.

10
00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:35.100
So you were really fucking young.
Yup.
Like what is that been like for you?

11
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.930
It's been a,

12
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.230
it's been both beautiful and scary and uncomfortable and learning and it's just

13
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:44.570
been a ton of learning and evolving and like,
uh,

14
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.880
it shows me every single day where I need to push myself and what I don't know.

15
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.170
And uh,
and I,

16
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.260
I think a big part is like just the realization that we're not going to be able

17
00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:57.870
to do this alone.
And I don't think we have to either.
The,
these are,

18
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.780
these are what the technologies continue to allow us.
We can,

19
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.200
if we have to have all the answers around enforcement or policy,
what not,
we're,

20
00:01:06.201 --> 00:01:08.880
we're not going to serve the world.

21
00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:12.630
We have aspirations to serve every single person on the planet and we have

22
00:01:12.631 --> 00:01:14.450
aspirations to,
you know,

23
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.020
be the first consideration for the global public conversation.

24
00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:23.480
And you know,
if,
if we're the bottleneck for all of this,

25
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.620
we're not going to reach those aspirations.

26
00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:30.621
So it just thinking deeply about how we might distribute more of this work and

27
00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:35.280
decentralize,
uh,
more of it and look at,
look at,
you know,

28
00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:40.281
the platform itself and like what we need to change to reach that reality.

29
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.940
And I think we've got to look really deepened foundational.
It goes back to,

30
00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:48.960
you know,
the,
the,
your question on one 40,
one of the things that we saw was,

31
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.860
you know,
we,
we shifted to 280 characters and that,
you know,

32
00:01:52.861 --> 00:01:56.130
this 140 characters is so sacred.
You know,
it,

33
00:01:56.131 --> 00:02:00.240
it became this cultural thing and I was in love with it.

34
00:02:00.241 --> 00:02:01.560
And so many people are in love with it.

35
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.340
But one of the things we noticed as we move to two 80 is that the fast majority

36
00:02:08.281 --> 00:02:12.990
of tweets that are broadcast don't go above one 40 even with that limitation

37
00:02:12.991 --> 00:02:17.490
raced.
But where they do go above a one 40 is in replies.

38
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:18.930
When people reply,

39
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.550
they tend to go over the hundred 40 character limit and even bump up into the

40
00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:27.120
two to 80 limit.
And what it a lot,
what we've seen,

41
00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:31.890
it allow us just more nuance in the conversation and allows people to give more

42
00:02:31.891 --> 00:02:33.480
context and,
and uh,

43
00:02:33.481 --> 00:02:36.660
and kind of just get their experience on the table a bit more.

44
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.470
Whereas one 40 did not allow that.
So we,

45
00:02:39.471 --> 00:02:44.471
we have seen that increase the health of those conversations and the

46
00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:48.870
discussions.
So it's stuff like that that we need to question and not hold.
So,

47
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.370
so sacred.
Is there any consideration to expanding it further?
Uh,
now,

48
00:02:53.371 --> 00:02:56.410
right now we were,
how about a million characters?
I know,

49
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.240
well we don't have edit tweets now,
so we did.
That's good or bad.

50
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.530
Well if you can't edit 140 characters are going to be really pissed off if you

51
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:08.350
write a million characters in cad.
Those things.
And you know what I would like,

52
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.600
I would like edit the ability to edit.

53
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:12.040
Like if you make a typo or something like that,

54
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:15.160
but also the ability for people to see the original.
Yeah,

55
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.790
like edit but see the original like site we're looking at exactly that.

56
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.140
Oh really?
We're looking at exactly that.

57
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.860
The reason we don't have it in the first place,
places we were born on SMS,

58
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:27.040
we were born on text messaging.
When you send a tax,
you can't take it back.
Right.

59
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.250
So when you send a tweet it goes to the world instantaneously.

60
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.560
You can't take it back.
So when we have to exist anyway,
I mean no matter what,

61
00:03:35.561 --> 00:03:38.170
if you send someone something,
even if you are on Instagram,

62
00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:41.170
people are going to know the original.
Yeah,
they screenshot it and they,
you know,

63
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:44.980
they,
they do their thing.
But like you could build it such that,
you know,

64
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:49.981
maybe we introduce a five second to 32nd to lay in the sending and within that

65
00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:55.290
window you can edit.
I'm going to need more time than that dude.
I fuck,

66
00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.160
fuck something up.
I'd like someone else to tell me you misspelled that word.

67
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.720
Oh Shit.
Did I?
God dammit.
The issue is autocorrect gets,
yeah,
totally.

68
00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:06.310
But the issue with going longer than that,

69
00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:09.610
it takes that realtime nature on the conversational flow out of it.

70
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.810
Then we're delaying these tweets and like when you're watching UFC,

71
00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:16.520
are you watching like warriors basketball?
A lot of,

72
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.750
a lot of the great Twitter is like,
just like in the moment it just like,

73
00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:24.000
you know,
it's the roar of the crowd.
It's like,
you know,
looking across a,

74
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.640
at someone you're in this virtual stadium worth and just saying like,
oh my God,

75
00:04:27.641 --> 00:04:29.170
that shot.
Can you believe it?

76
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.160
Isn't clarity more important because you're not going to spend on context.

77
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.020
It depends on the kind of have the ability to communicate quickly.
Yeah.

78
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.490
But you also have the ability to clarify.
That's it.

79
00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.960
That's where we need to really pay attention.
Because

80
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.340
if you're,
if you're in the context of an NBA game,

81
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.310
you want to be fast and you just want to be at the moment and you just,

82
00:04:51.311 --> 00:04:52.630
you don't,
you want to be Robert.

83
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.860
If you're in the context of considering what the president interested or making

84
00:04:56.861 --> 00:04:59.640
a particular statement,
then you probably need some,

85
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.990
some more time and we can be dynamic though.
