WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.440
Yeah,
yeah.
Yup.

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.210
<v 1>So you just find whatever's laying around tire cinder.
Yup.
Anything,</v>

3
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.360
<v 0>you know,
if I have a wall,
I could do a lot with that.
Let's say it's a five,</v>

4
00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:12.380
six foot wall.

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.640
There's a lot you could do it that lot you could do with just a tree.
Um,

6
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.100
some cinder blocks,
you know,
uh,

7
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.550
and then every once in a while guys will bring like a 90 pound sandbag or a

8
00:00:22.551 --> 00:00:27.430
couple of kettle bells because now it's a thing,
right?
Expect it sort of like,
hi,

9
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.760
we want to do a pat Mac workout after range day.
And uh,
you know,

10
00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:34.760
Kudos to those guys because that shit that's hard.
You know,

11
00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:38.690
when you're on the range all day working your ass off and especially in a

12
00:00:38.691 --> 00:00:43.160
blazing hot sun and guys hang out to do a workout with me,

13
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.470
like bad kudos

14
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:46.460
<v 1>to you bro.
Well,</v>

15
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.830
one of the cool things about the internet is that people find other people that

16
00:00:50.831 --> 00:00:54.460
want to push themselves and they find inspiration through guys like you.

17
00:00:54.461 --> 00:00:55.091
And there's,
you know,

18
00:00:55.091 --> 00:00:59.770
dozens of guys like you online that are like fun to follow and you get,

19
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.830
you go,
this guy guy's doing it.
I got to fucking get off my ass and go do it.

20
00:01:02.831 --> 00:01:05.020
Because sometimes people just need an example.

21
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.950
They need someone to look at and go this and it literally can change the way you

22
00:01:08.951 --> 00:01:12.160
live your life.
No doubt.
See a guy who's doing what you're doing.
You like,

23
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.740
God dammit,
he's fucking intense all the time he's getting after it.

24
00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:19.190
Look at his beard
like lucky over here there's a cinder block.

25
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.650
I love that.
Eagle Lake,
Texas.

26
00:01:23.651 --> 00:01:28.570
Probably three years ago.
What's the smoke?
Is that exhaust fume or gunshot?
No,

27
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.040
the the owner.
I know what that he was,
he was smoking.
Um,

28
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.200
it was a smoker.
Oh,
he was making meat.
Oh Nice.
Yup,
Yup.
Yeah.

29
00:01:38.201 --> 00:01:40.240
But those are,
that's,
those are hard workouts,

30
00:01:40.241 --> 00:01:44.150
man swings in between the legs like that.
That's how you build the,

31
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.400
the real core strength.
If you're back and you know,
your,
your whole,

32
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.700
the whole spinal column.
Yeah.
Keep it tight and strong.

33
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.080
<v 0>No,
it's,
it's,
it's funny you get,</v>

34
00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.060
even today I read,
I'm reading some comments about whatever it is.

35
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.060
There's a lot of stupid people out there when it comes to like not understanding

36
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.490
the right way to work out,
right?
And I want to tell these guys,
hey man,

37
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.090
two things.
One is if you do,
if you do what you've always done,

38
00:02:16.091 --> 00:02:18.280
you're going to get what you've always gotten.
Number two,

39
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.980
I didn't go home last night and smoke a bunch of crack and dream of shit up.

40
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.480
I mean,
there's not,
I've,
I've done a law to freaking research a lot of,
um,

41
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.220
there's a lot of time and effort that's gone into this and um,

42
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.950
they'll say,
hey man,
you're gonna throw your back out doing that stuff.

43
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.420
No mother Fucker,
that's,
that's in your back.
You know,

44
00:02:37.421 --> 00:02:42.190
work in that transverse plane is what guys neglect a lot.
See here,

45
00:02:42.191 --> 00:02:44.890
here we go.
I'm going to get on this freaking soap box.
I swear to God,

46
00:02:44.891 --> 00:02:48.160
go ahead and go get on the bum.
Do a box where most guys,

47
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.660
most guys work out,
they live in what I call a sagittal listic environment.

48
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.780
You know,
three planes of motion,
frontal saggital transverse.

49
00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.120
So they're in this sagittal world doing bench and concentration curls.

50
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.380
Um,
out of the three planes of motion,

51
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.120
I would say that transverse is most important.
Additionally,
when we work out,

52
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.150
I would also argue with confidence that it's the plain emotion that is most

53
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:17.890
neglected.
That transverse plane.

54
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.170
I like to tell guys that in the transverse plane lives lifesaving an ass kicking

55
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.170
their full reasons why we should,
why we should exercise.

56
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.120
This is Max opinion.
Okay.
One self preservation,
longevity,

57
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.440
good for your health.
Stronger,
longer motion is lotion.

58
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.870
Number two,
the ability to save your own life.
Having that confidence,
no one.
Yup.

59
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.890
I could pull myself out of that burning coal or over that wall or whatever.

60
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.820
Number three,
more importantly to me is being Batman,

61
00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:55.870
the ability to save somebody else's life.
So that's three reasons.
The last one,

62
00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.670
kicking somebody fucking ass.
So when I look at workout,

63
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.410
I look at those four things,
right?

64
00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:05.770
They're not like cosmetics or anything.

65
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.770
Cosmetics is a cool byproducts.
Do you work out right?

66
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.590
You're going to look better.
You look better,
you feel better,

67
00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:13.540
you're more confident,
you're more confident.

68
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.840
It performed better cause confidence,
performance work hand in hand.
Sure.

69
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.150
So I mean there's no freaking magic elixir to it.

70
00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:25.690
You know it and it's,
and it's hard

71
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.570
<v 1>like to see,
there was like,
if you do bench press,</v>

72
00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:31.840
you see a chest puff up and they see those results.
I always tell people,

73
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:34.840
if there's one exercise I would recommend,
like people who do Jujitsu,

74
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.670
Turkish getup,
right?
It's the least romance week.

75
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.620
It's the least romantic of all workouts.
Nobody wants to do those goddamn things.

76
00:04:41.621 --> 00:04:44.830
Go to go to a gym.
You could go to a hundred gyms if you're lucky.

77
00:04:44.831 --> 00:04:48.970
You find one person doing Turkish getup.
Yep.
Every gym we'll have someone,

78
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.290
someone somewhere is doing bench press and someone's doing curls and lat pull

79
00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:56.440
down machine and all that normal shit.
Yeah.
Working out

80
00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.310
<v 0>[inaudible] there.
It's,</v>

81
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.190
it's like an anachronism.
You know,

82
00:05:02.191 --> 00:05:06.390
they're working in a world like a muscle and fitness world still,

83
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.460
and that's fine working in isolation if that's your job.

84
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.950
There's three people who,
three types of people who should work,

85
00:05:13.951 --> 00:05:17.640
how it concentration,
like doing uh,
a curl or some,
you know,

86
00:05:17.641 --> 00:05:20.340
a concentration curls,
a professional bodybuilder,
right.

87
00:05:20.341 --> 00:05:23.610
That's your job man at your sport.
Number two,

88
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.840
you recovering from surgery and atrophy.
So it's physical therapy.
Number three,

89
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.010
<v 1>he had no fucking idea what you're doing or you're a model and trying to look</v>

90
00:05:31.011 --> 00:05:34.190
sexy as fuck.
You know what I'm saying?
Oh,

91
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.670
that's right.
Yeah.
I mean,
yeah.
Right.

92
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.710
So they fall in that same category trying to like print out.
Yup.
Yup.
Yeah.

93
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.330
If you,
it's,
it's just not what you really need to exercise with.

94
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.180
Exercise is something that's going to mimic what you would actually do in real

95
00:05:50.181 --> 00:05:54.830
life.
Picking up things,
moving them around like farmer walks.
Yup.
Pharma Walk,

96
00:05:54.831 --> 00:05:55.850
very unglamorous.

97
00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.890
Carry a heavy ass bell in one hand and just walk around for like a half a mile

98
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.460
and be your fucking forum would be dying.
Your legs would be killing you.

99
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:07.030
Your core is going to be shaking.
It's amazing.

100
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.940
<v 0>And I liked the way you put it to carry on once,
you know,
one side of it.</v>

101
00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.930
<v 1>Yeah,
that's,
you got to do it.
People don't know that.</v>

102
00:06:12.931 --> 00:06:14.040
They try to do with two arms,

103
00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:17.910
but with two arms it bounces out and then it's really just a grip and a leg

104
00:06:17.911 --> 00:06:22.080
exercise,
a little bit of lats and traps.
But really why you want to do is one,

105
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.650
100 pounder on one hand,
carry that bitch.

106
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.700
Everything is just kind of balance it out and then turn around,

107
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.190
put it on the left hand.
Yeah.

108
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.330
<v 0>Yeah.
It's great.
We do 'em at my gym,</v>

109
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.720
a lot of that where we load one side of the time.

110
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.740
One of the things I love to hear is a guy will say,
man,

111
00:06:43.741 --> 00:06:47.970
I'd never see you doing the same thing.
Yeah.
I'm like,
well,
I pretty much don't.

112
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:53.050
Um,
because I don't want to fall into a Rut of complacent adaptation,
you know?
Um,

113
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.410
so even guys who say,
do you,
uh,
do you do like Oly Lifts?

114
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.650
Yeah,
of course.
Every once in a while I'll probably do a dead lift,

115
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.720
a standard dead lift once every two months,
but I'm doing variations of that.

116
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.630
Like a shovel dead lift or a suitcase,
you know,

117
00:07:09.631 --> 00:07:14.390
dead lifts that suck and are like you said,
are not glamorous.
Yeah.
Um,

118
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.360
I'll throw those in a bunch.
Uh,
but do you do much cardio?

119
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:24.570
Here's how I knock out cardio is uh,
have a uh,

120
00:07:24.571 --> 00:07:26.620
formula.
Um,

121
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.790
with this I have a program combat strength train.

122
00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.200
I got an e book and website and all of this.
And those are your programs,

123
00:07:33.201 --> 00:07:37.460
something that people could sign up for?
Yeah,
yeah,
they can buy the ebook.
Is it,

124
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:41.400
what's the website for Jamie could pull it up.
Combat Strength training.com.

125
00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:48.170
And the formula is work in work in anaerobic chunks in circuit to near metabolic

126
00:07:50.071 --> 00:07:54.450
threshold to meet in a robot goal and then like 30,
35 minutes.

127
00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:59.460
So that doesn't include warm up,
you know,
so you good.
Whatever it is.

128
00:07:59.461 --> 00:08:01.980
For me it's like bag work or something for warm up,

129
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.070
just to make sure everything's Loosey Goosey.
The older you are,

130
00:08:05.071 --> 00:08:09.000
the more you have to warm up,
man.
Damn.
Don't Jack yourself up.

131
00:08:09.001 --> 00:08:11.010
It's called fitness,
not brokeness.

132
00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:13.823
<v 1>Yeah.
People.</v>

133
00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.250
That's another thing that people don't like to do because it's not glamorous and

134
00:08:17.251 --> 00:08:19.050
because the people get lazy,

135
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:21.920
they don't want to do that workout where the preworkout,

136
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.710
they don't want to do all the skipping rope and all.

137
00:08:24.711 --> 00:08:28.470
They'll just switch and stances and jumping jacks and all that stuff.

138
00:08:28.471 --> 00:08:32.340
But you really need to break a sweat of real sweat before you actually start

139
00:08:32.341 --> 00:08:35.430
lifting weights.
And then even if you lift weights or do anything,

140
00:08:35.431 --> 00:08:38.880

141
00:08:38.881 --> 00:08:42.000

They don't,
I don't start off heavy.
