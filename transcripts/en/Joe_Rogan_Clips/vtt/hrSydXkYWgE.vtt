WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.400
Uh,
I guess we have to say that too.
Yeah.

2
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.970
Obviously it's a ridiculous time and,

3
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.870
and like everyone's been saying again,
you know what I mean?

4
00:00:13.871 --> 00:00:17.590
It's like,
here we go again.
Another again,
another mass shooting.

5
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.210
And that the,

6
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.110
I think the most disturbing graphic to me was the scorecard.

7
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.090
Like they showed like this guy got 58 and then the guy in Orlando got what?

8
00:00:28.091 --> 00:00:31.720
40 something.
And so because it's like,
okay,

9
00:00:31.721 --> 00:00:36.250
you just encouraged the next cycle to try to set the record,

10
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.250
you know what I mean?
Like it,
like it shouldn't be,

11
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.290
there has to be another way to say it without giving publicity to he killed more

12
00:00:44.291 --> 00:00:47.800
than anybody else,
you know?
Well,
for everybody's listening to them,

13
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.320
<v 1>the future,
this is taking place.
We're recording this on Tuesday.
Uh,</v>

14
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.340
the massacre happened in Las Vegas on Sunday,

15
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.800
so it's just a couple of days ago.
And,
uh,

16
00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:02.340
we were just going over all the details of it.
I'm,
I'm reading online here,

17
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.610
killed 59 people injured 527,

18
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:08.490
which is just fucking completely insane.

19
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.230
I mean 527 people shot.

20
00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:16.050
Is that right or is that like,
does that count?
People trampled?

21
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.350
<v 0>I think it,
it includes people trampled in injured otherwise,</v>

22
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.540
but there were a hell of a lot of people shot.
I mean,

23
00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:27.520
he opened up with automatic weapons into a crowd of thousands of people to where

24
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.660
probably,
you know,
did any bullets hit the ground?
Like there were so many people,

25
00:01:31.661 --> 00:01:35.950
if this thing that every bullet probably hit somebody,
you know,

26
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.120
or more than one person depending,
I don't know the,

27
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.950
the power of the ballistics of the a weapon,
but,
oh yeah,
he,
you know,

28
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.990
it definitely like bullets could have went through one guy into that

29
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.610
<v 1>Mac hunter since I'm sure they did.
I'm 100%,
um,</v>

30
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.270
this guy,
first of all,
there's a,
you know,
everybody's a,

31
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.990
it's becomes a big gun control argument,
which it should be.
Right.
But,
uh,

32
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.830
one thing that we got to really take into consideration,
he had an illegal guns.

33
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.150
These guns were illegal,
I think for 25 years.
So this isn't,
um,

34
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.190
I don't know how much of this could have been helped by making it more legal.

35
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.060
<v 0>Yeah.
It,
it,
you know,
that's always the debate first.</v>

36
00:02:14.061 --> 00:02:19.061
The first problem is what was going on yesterday when they say this is not the

37
00:02:19.581 --> 00:02:22.310
time to talk about guns.
And it,
it,
yeah,

38
00:02:22.311 --> 00:02:25.140
of course it's the exact time to talk about guns and,
and,

39
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.000
and I'm not a gun guy in the sense that I'm not a gun owner,

40
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.790
but I get it with guys who are into guns.

41
00:02:31.791 --> 00:02:34.990
I always compare it to my love of cars and bikes or,
you know,

42
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.020
anything mechanical or whatever.
I understand it,
but,
but the people,

43
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.430
most of the people I talk to who love guns don't have a problem with like

44
00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:48.330
registration certainly don't have a problem with education and,

45
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.380
and what I call common sense gun ownership and that there's some guns that I get

46
00:02:53.421 --> 00:02:56.690
it,
you want,
there are some guns that,
you know,
and again,

47
00:02:56.691 --> 00:03:00.610
I'm not speaking with any expertise,
but from the layman's point of view,

48
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:01.390
it's like,

49
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.250
why do you need this semiautomatic military style weapon?

50
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.860
And,
and,
uh,
uh,
you know,

51
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.250
don't tell me you have it for hunting or anything else.

52
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:13.960
Like if there's a reason you want to collect it,

53
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:17.020
just like if there's a reason you want to own a race card,
right?

54
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:20.320
And somebody says,
why do you need a car that does 200 miles an hour?
Well,

55
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:24.340
you may have a reason you want that race car,
but you don't use it on the street.

56
00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:27.610
You can't take it,
you know,
onto the streets and that,

57
00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:32.200
and I think that should be that there should be some kind of rule with that kind

58
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:34.540
of weapon,
that event.
Here's the thing,
it doesn't matter if there's a rule.

59
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:36.250
This guy,
there were plenty of rules.
Yeah,

60
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.610
that guy violated all the rules that this guy did.

61
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.420
But I'm just talking about the general attitude towards sales.

62
00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:48.421
Just the idea that you can walk into a store and buy these weapons.

63
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.620
Yeah.
It should somehow be more difficult to,
you know,
and again,

64
00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:54.730
this is my opinion,
right?

65
00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:58.840
But I think it should be more difficult to buy a weapon of that tight.
Yeah.
Well,

66
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.750
these are all illegal weapons.
This guy,
this guy,

67
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.650
he converted them to fully automatic and fully automatics illegal everywhere.

68
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:07.270
Right?
Here's what's fucked up about this guy.

69
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.600
This guy didn't have a criminal record.
He had no army training,

70
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.660
no religious or political affiliation affiliations.

71
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.810
No one has any idea what his motives were.
He was wealthy.

72
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.950
He's a big time high roller,
which is how he got this giant suite in Vegas.

73
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.710
I mean it is fucking bizarre.
Did you see his brother get interviewed?
Yeah.
Yeah,

74
00:04:26.711 --> 00:04:30.700
and,
and it's,
well,
it's,
that's the one thing about this,

75
00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:33.220
that's the thing about this kind of insanity,
right?

76
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.730
There is usually no outward.
Like,

77
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.270
like how many people are like this in this country that we don't know about?

78
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.290
You know what I mean?
That have as particularly if you're wealthy,

79
00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:47.590
if you're wealthy,
it's so much easier to hide it,
right?

80
00:04:47.591 --> 00:04:51.460
Because you may have a big house,
you may have a compound,
you may have a,

81
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.330
you know,
a camp,

82
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.770
a place you go camping in the woods that's actually stocked with a,
you know,

83
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.660
a hundred weapons or something like that.

84
00:04:58.661 --> 00:05:01.960
I mean that the randomness of this,

85
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.910
to me that is the biggest horror.

86
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.100
The worst thing about this to me is just the idea of like you went to a fucking

87
00:05:09.101 --> 00:05:10.990
concert,
right?
Like that's all you did.

88
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.350
You went to a concert in Vegas and you're never coming home.

89
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.190
Your family's destroyed everything.
I mean,
and,

90
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.510
and that is the utter randomness of it that you can't control.
Well,

91
00:05:22.511 --> 00:05:25.510
that's what's terrifying about it.
This is,
which is really strange to me,

92
00:05:25.511 --> 00:05:29.530
the definition of terrorist.
Nobody's calling this guy a terrorist.

93
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.880
Like what do you have to be like political or religious to be a terrorist?

94
00:05:33.881 --> 00:05:37.780
Like how the fuck I'm not a terrorist?
Yes,
this is definitely terror.

95
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.040
This is definitely terror because the unit,

96
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.440
you know why it's terrible because now are you going to go to a big event in

97
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:47.020
Vegas?
Are you going to go to a big outdoor calm?
You know,

98
00:05:47.021 --> 00:05:51.380
Vegas does these music festivals in front of sees these towers,
right?

99
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.550
And then someone could do something like this and the,
and the pools,
you know,

100
00:05:54.551 --> 00:05:59.551
they have those giant Edm parties at pools all summer that are literally

101
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:02.870
surrounded by the Tower of whatever hotel you're in.
So net.

102
00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:07.640
So that's why it's terror because now you have to be afraid to do that.

103
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.670
<v 1>Well,
not only that,
like this,</v>

104
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.410
now they're going to have some sort of screening when you go into hotels,

105
00:06:14.411 --> 00:06:17.530
which by the way,
why the fuck didn't they have them already?

106
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.580
How I've always thought this,
like the airports are so stringent.

107
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.160
Like you go through the airports,
they check your deck.

108
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.340
They literally will pat your Dick if you hit a random,
you know,
being,

109
00:06:27.341 --> 00:06:29.530
I'm sorry sir,
we got to check your day,
your random,

110
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.900
and they literally put the back of their hand.

111
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.560
This was a really odd to me that it's okay to touch your Dick with the back,

112
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.230
back of your hand.
It's like the less sensitive they get to see me.

113
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.830
They get to smooth it down.
But that's so weird.
Like it's okay sir.

114
00:06:44.831 --> 00:06:48.100
I'm just using the back of my hand and touch your Dick.
Like they might have had,

115
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.440
they might have had them grabbing and some guy was just like,

116
00:06:50.441 --> 00:06:53.920
I'm not grabbing a hard dick.
Yeah,
there's no doubt it was dumb.

117
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.300
They get down you the other guy,

118
00:06:55.301 --> 00:07:00.301
like I'm not getting my dick hard by some guy who's looking for a weapon.

119
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.750
It's just weird that they can do that.
But if you go to the airport,
right?

120
00:07:04.751 --> 00:07:09.250
Like airports we've decided are places where terror exists.
Right?

121
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:14.070
So you have like,
like I have a TSA pre and I have a

122
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.930
<v 0>oh global entry guy and all of that have a clear,</v>

123
00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:23.720
clear is the best.
Clear is the best way.
Fingers it,
right?
Yeah.

124
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.340
Would it have it?
Yeah.
He just put your fingers,

125
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.650
<v 1>Bam.
It's got a picture of you go right through.
It takes two seconds,
right?
Yeah.</v>

126
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.510
But that's just a place where we've decided you have terror.
Right.

127
00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:36.600
And now are we going to decide that you have terror everywhere?

128
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.660
<v 0>No,
I don't think so.
I mean,
for one thing I,
I'm,</v>

129
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.750
I'm not buying into the hotel argument.
Like there's a bigger issue here,

130
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.230
then the hotels and the issue is the weapons.

131
00:07:47.231 --> 00:07:50.300
And what can we do about the prolific,
uh,

132
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:55.110
the collation of weapons?
Proliferation.
Proliferation of weapons?
Yes.

133
00:07:55.111 --> 00:07:59.470
Sorry about that.
You started,
where did you go?
Oh,
I'm too deep into this word.

134
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:04.390
I got too deep into a word now there's no backing out all the damn weapon.
No,

135
00:08:04.391 --> 00:08:07.120
but that,
but that's the issue.
The thing about hotels though,

136
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.870
and this being the United States,
the privacy issue is huge,
right?

137
00:08:10.871 --> 00:08:15.670
You're a hotel room is basically your home away from home.
When do you get,

138
00:08:15.671 --> 00:08:19.720
what other privacy rules of checking what you bring into a hotel?

139
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:24.580
What's in your hotel room room?
Remember the,
um,
the stoplight cameras,

140
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:25.810
right?
Yes.

141
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:30.640
And they got sued and people got in trouble because they got that picture taken

142
00:08:30.641 --> 00:08:34.930
and the wrong person was in their cart.
Write that check.
Wasn't his wife.

143
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:39.700
Yeah.
Or this guy wasn't as husband.
One guy sued because he,

144
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.190
the picture was taken.
The woman wasn't his wife.

145
00:08:42.191 --> 00:08:46.710
They send the ticket to your house.
Right?
He got into a,
yeah,
exactly.
And,

146
00:08:46.711 --> 00:08:49.360
and he won the suit in the sense that you're,

147
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:53.720
there's a level of privacy that's expected in your car.

148
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:58.020
Do you understand why that it's illegal though.
Cause it's,
it's a third party.

149
00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:59.430
It's not actually even the government.
Right.

150
00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:04.110
They farmed it off some other company that's sending you a ticket and charging

151
00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:06.560
you money.
Right.
Well and everybody was like,
well what do you,

152
00:09:06.561 --> 00:09:10.600
you guys are having your hiring people to do this commissioning.
Yeah.

153
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.960
A place to write tickets they had to do,

154
00:09:12.961 --> 00:09:16.500
they had to rename the cameras to only hit the license plate.

155
00:09:16.501 --> 00:09:17.101
But that's not true.

156
00:09:17.101 --> 00:09:20.370
Cause I got one the other day and just showed you and sent me a picture of me

157
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.100
smiling.
Well it's not a little cocky.

158
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.820
Tried to go right on red and it flashed me.
But,

159
00:09:26.821 --> 00:09:30.330
but the point being in your hotel room like this,

160
00:09:30.331 --> 00:09:32.290
an expectation of privacy and,

161
00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.400
and where is that line drawn?

162
00:09:35.401 --> 00:09:38.580
The other one's going to have to be drawn in Vegas Cause people get freaky in

163
00:09:38.581 --> 00:09:43.410
Vegas.
Right.
The other big difference,
and I'll tell you a Vegas story about that.

164
00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:47.490
That's great.
I heard,
but the other big difference is when you're on an airplane,

165
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:52.440
your trapped in that airplane when you're in a hotel like you can run.

166
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.720
You know what I mean?
You can run down the stairs.

167
00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:58.770
You really know you compared to being in an airplane.

168
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.500
I don't think it's a valid comparison,
honestly.

169
00:10:01.501 --> 00:10:04.930
I mean it's like you're still in a box.
You're still,
you're in it,

170
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.860
you're in a confined space.
But I think it's easy to escape.

171
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:11.700
Now the thing about about Vegas,
this guy told me who was a security guy,

172
00:10:11.701 --> 00:10:14.460
he said the thing about the cameras is you,

173
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:19.200
you see who's with who and that there was one particular guy that kept seeing

174
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:23.490
but he kept bringing transgender hookers to a girl and like they knew who he
was.

175
00:10:23.491 --> 00:10:26.610
He was like a famous guy and they were like,
yeah we can,

176
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:30.140
we could destroy this guy if we wanted.
We got,

177
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.610
cause they got cameras everywhere in Vegas.
Right.

178
00:10:32.611 --> 00:10:34.790
They know who's coming upstairs,
right room.

179
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.240
They know what room they're going to get.

180
00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:40.470
Like super obvious transgender ones like yeah,
like the giant football player

181
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:47.280
guys.
You felt like you dresses on.
So,
uh,
you know,

182
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.240
so I had to give up that hobby.
No,
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

183
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:54.240
That's the only thing from this podcast.
It's going to go out viral.
We knew it.

184
00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:00.150
Well,
here's another thing that is a giant issue is that,
uh,

185
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.350
I haven't heard discussed at all mental health.
I mean,

186
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.790
this is really what this is all about.
This is not,
I mean,

187
00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:08.790
this is a gun issue in the sense that he used guns,

188
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:13.050
but then is it a truck issue in Nice France where that guy just drove into us

189
00:11:13.051 --> 00:11:15.180
people?
I mean,
is it,
uh,
I mean,

190
00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:18.090
there's a ton of different ways to kill people and I'm sure we're going to see

191
00:11:18.091 --> 00:11:20.100
more of these fucked up ways in the future,

192
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.670
but the real issue is a mental health issue.
Now,

193
00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:28.050
this guy's dad was a psychopath.

194
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.490
He was a serial bank robber.
He spent eight years on the FBI's most wanted list.

195
00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.170
Here's the question,
right?
Like is that genetic?

196
00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:40.830
Like does that transfer over?
Like how does that work?

197
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.920
It could be genetic or it could be that psychological thing of I want to outdo

198
00:11:46.291 --> 00:11:50.970
my dad.
This,
this guy could be,
I mean,
no,
this guy's a millionaire.

199
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.670
Right.
And so on.
Like,
so he's,
he's a high achiever,

200
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.070
but he could have that whole,
I'm not kidding,

201
00:11:57.071 --> 00:12:01.060
you could have that hole where he always wanted to do something bigger than his

202
00:12:01.061 --> 00:12:03.520
dad or he wanted some approval.
You know what I mean?

203
00:12:03.521 --> 00:12:08.370
Some weird kind of approval thing.
Just speculation,
right?
I mean,

204
00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:11.150
yeah,
I mean you could speculate,
uh,
you know,
a bunch,

205
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.840
our mental health issue,

206
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:17.530
just the health issue in this country that that's a show unto itself,
right?

207
00:12:17.531 --> 00:12:20.740
We don't,
we don't take care of ourselves.
We don't take care of people.

208
00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:24.880
We don't provide for the mental health,
the mental health problem.

209
00:12:24.881 --> 00:12:29.650
You look downtown in any city in America,
wandering the streets,

210
00:12:29.651 --> 00:12:34.450
homeless,
you got schizophrenia and,
and all kinds of people and you know,

211
00:12:34.451 --> 00:12:37.100
God forbid they got weapons,
you know,
who knows?

212
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.170
Like you talk about the other ways.

213
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.520
I'm sure there are attacks that we just don't hear about.

214
00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:47.140
You know where some guy goes nuts with a knife or a broken bottle or whatever

215
00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:47.800
else,

216
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.020
<v 1>man,
that's one of the big things that happens in places that have stricter gun</v>

217
00:12:51.021 --> 00:12:55.610
control.
And the argument would be that,
hey,
you know,
that's safer for the people.

218
00:12:55.611 --> 00:12:59.090
It's easier to handle.
There's,
you know,
more things that you can do.

219
00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:03.170
Some guy with a machine gun gunning down all of these people.
But again,

220
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:08.600
gun control's not really going to help this.
This guy was using illegal guns.

221
00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:13.130
I mean the issue at this point is that there's so many guns out there.

222
00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.350
Like even if you make guns illegal,

223
00:13:15.351 --> 00:13:18.200
what are we going to sweep or are we going to go house to house?

224
00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:22.010
And if we do sweep and go house to house,
man,

225
00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:26.690
people are going to resist that because for every one of these psychopaths that

226
00:13:26.691 --> 00:13:29.660
winds up shooting people and,
and,
and gunning someone down,

227
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.120
there's going to be genuine,

228
00:13:32.121 --> 00:13:35.000
normal people that want a gun to protect their family.

229
00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.580
Maybe they live in a sketchy neighborhood and then all of a sudden the

230
00:13:37.581 --> 00:13:38.630
government comes along and says,

231
00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:42.560
well now it's illegal for you to possess that gun.
Well then who has guns?

232
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:46.260
<v 0>Well,
already criminals.
So yeah,
I think the solution is in between.</v>

233
00:13:46.261 --> 00:13:50.970
And I think this is another one where we get,
you know,
this is a problem we have.

234
00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.830
I,
and I can't even say when it started,

235
00:13:52.831 --> 00:13:57.090
when you have the two sides and it's either or.
So it's either,
you know,

236
00:13:57.091 --> 00:14:01.560
no gun regulations or,
or far too many gun regulations.

237
00:14:01.561 --> 00:14:04.980
And I think the solution is somewhere in between.
In my opinion,

238
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:09.390
it's always been like,
why can't we treat them like cars?
Like when you buy a car,

239
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:12.060
you registered the car,
right?
So the government knows,

240
00:14:12.061 --> 00:14:15.390
like Joe knows Joe has this car,
right?
And then when you,

241
00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:19.170
you have to have insurance in case something goes wrong with the car and you

242
00:14:19.171 --> 00:14:24.150
hurt somebody.
And then if you sell the car to me,
you tell the government,

243
00:14:24.151 --> 00:14:27.870
hey,
I just sold the car to Alonzo.
I'm no longer liable for this car.

244
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.610
Alonzo's liable for this car.
And I vote.

245
00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:34.920
I've always thought that would be the level of common sense gun,

246
00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:37.620
a registration.
Well here's another one that goes along with that.

247
00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:39.390
With guns you don't really have to know how to use them.

248
00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.810
This is where unfortunately fucked up things about,
unfortunately

249
00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:45.930
<v 1>you drive a car,
you have to take tests,
you have to pass,</v>

250
00:14:45.931 --> 00:14:49.500
you have to understand the registration,
the,
the,
the,
the rules rather.
I mean,

251
00:14:49.501 --> 00:14:52.640
you have to,
you have to go,
a guy has a sit next to you.

252
00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:54.800
We have to go through a driver's test

253
00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:57.700
<v 0>and I don't see why we can't do that with guns.
You should absolutely.</v>

254
00:14:57.701 --> 00:14:59.950
You have to go to a range and show,
you know,

255
00:14:59.951 --> 00:15:04.820
like the safety of using a gun and,
and how to shoot it.
Yeah,
I don't,

256
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:08.290
I don't see why we can't do that.
And even if your family teaches you,
right,

257
00:15:08.291 --> 00:15:11.470
they say like in a lot of places you grow up with guns and it's a kid.

258
00:15:11.471 --> 00:15:14.890
Your Dad teaches you.
Well if your dad teaches you to drive,

259
00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.840
you still have to go to DMV and take the test.
So it's like your dad,
your mom,

260
00:15:19.841 --> 00:15:24.400
whoever your uncle could teach you to shoot,
but you still,
there should be some,

261
00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:28.990
some level of testing to get an idea.
Cause we have,
you know,

262
00:15:28.991 --> 00:15:33.700
just a couple of weeks ago where you had a four year old in Florida who was

263
00:15:33.701 --> 00:15:38.140
looking in their grandmother's purse for candy and shot themselves.

264
00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.280
And it's like that grandma,
there's a safety issue with the gun.

265
00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:46.810
Like you don't tell the kid to go get some candy when you know you have a gun.

266
00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.260
<v 1>I think there's a nutty number,</v>

267
00:15:48.261 --> 00:15:52.220
like 21 people a year are killed in this country by arm.
Toddlers.

268
00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.620
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
I believe it.
I believe it.</v>

269
00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:59.070
<v 1>Find out what the number is.
I think it's 21 people were shot to death by babies.</v>

270
00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:02.610
<v 0>Yeah.
Any of the other thing is,
and you brought it up like how,
okay,</v>

271
00:16:02.611 --> 00:16:04.770
if we didn't have guns then they'd be killing,
you know,

272
00:16:04.771 --> 00:16:08.270
with knives or clubs or something like,
just that idea that,

273
00:16:08.271 --> 00:16:10.440
that we have to have that discussion like,

274
00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:14.970
well what weapon at a mass killer is going to use?
That in itself is insane.

275
00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:18.720
Just the fact that we're like,
yeah,
we're going to have these mass killers.

276
00:16:18.721 --> 00:16:22.290
We got to have them working with different weapons.
Uh,
I don't,

277
00:16:22.291 --> 00:16:25.270
I don't know on the mental health I,

278
00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:29.430
I'm not even going to pretend to have the expertise to talk about what it is,

279
00:16:29.431 --> 00:16:31.620
but it's an issue that we don't spend money on.

280
00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:35.310
It's an issue not covered by a lot of insurance.

281
00:16:35.311 --> 00:16:39.180
A lot of insurance doesn't cover any kind of mental health care.

282
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.060
<v 1>Here's the thing,</v>

283
00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:45.680
even if it does cover mean a giant percentage of the people that commit these

284
00:16:45.681 --> 00:16:50.681
giant mass shootings are either on psychoactive medication or are having

285
00:16:51.051 --> 00:16:54.920
withdrawals from psychoactive medications.
So even if your insurance covers it,

286
00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.810
even if you're medicated by a doctor,
there's like,

287
00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:03.260
there's a disassociated quality apparently with a lot of these antidepressants

288
00:17:03.261 --> 00:17:07.250
and anti psychotic medications that people take that with the right combination

289
00:17:07.251 --> 00:17:10.220
of biology,
circumstances,
genetics,
whatever it is.

290
00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:15.390
People just can snap and they don't have an issue.
I mean,
what,

291
00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:18.090
what are the numbers of people that are on that stuff?
A giant number,
right?

292
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:21.620
What are the numbers of people that actually wind up and go and do shootings?

293
00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.200
Much,
much,
much,
much,
much smaller number.

294
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:27.170
But it's enough that if it happens once a year,

295
00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:29.600
like Orlando last year and then this year in Vegas,

296
00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:33.980
I mean what the Fuck Nigga again,
we don't know why this guy did this.

297
00:17:33.981 --> 00:17:35.750
We will have no idea if he was on anything.

298
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:40.520
But what the fuck is it that we have to do to stop this stuff from happening?

299
00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:43.620
<v 0>Well,
I mean,
I'm sure there were scientists who study it and all,</v>

300
00:17:43.621 --> 00:17:47.970
but I can't imagine people look at,
you can predict it.
People getting shot got

301
00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:51.600
<v 1>by toddlers on a basis this year cause Jesus Christ.</v>

302
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:55.590
How many people have killed themselves?
18 more injured themselves,

303
00:17:55.650 --> 00:18:00.390
10 injured other people to kill the other people.
That was from 2015

304
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.530
toddlers have killed at least shot at least 23 people this year.

305
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:11.790
Jesus fucking Christ.
Five months.

306
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.230
Oh my God.

307
00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:14.540
<v 0>Okay,
so we can't,</v>

308
00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:19.010
we cannot match that with no argument of toddler drivers having run over people.

309
00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:23.240
No.
Well,
irresponsible gun owners.
That is.
And,
and again,

310
00:18:23.241 --> 00:18:26.930
that gets back to what you're saying,
the education,

311
00:18:26.931 --> 00:18:31.550
like learn to own a gun safely to keep it somewhere where a toddler's not going

312
00:18:31.551 --> 00:18:35.600
to get to it.
I have something,
everything dangerous safely,
everything.

313
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:40.410
And isn't it funny how,
you know,
we do kid proof a house,
like,

314
00:18:40.411 --> 00:18:40.950
like you know,

315
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:45.770
they have some plastic things that go into the electrical sockets and the poison

316
00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.890
initially that,
what about the gun?
Hey,
throw it in the candy drawer,

317
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:53.570
put it under your pillow.
Kid's never going to get there.
Yeah,
I mean there,

318
00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.540
there's a lot of responsibility.
I don't mean to laugh,

319
00:18:56.541 --> 00:18:59.510
but I mean I'm laughing at the ridiculous of it and that,
and that is true.

320
00:18:59.511 --> 00:19:04.010
And I think the vast majority of gun owners are,
are um,

321
00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:08.630
responsible.
You know,
it is another group that's painted with the broad brush,

322
00:19:08.631 --> 00:19:08.871
right?

323
00:19:08.871 --> 00:19:13.871
That th the few gun nuts crazy what they paint every NRA member as being one of

324
00:19:15.591 --> 00:19:19.700
them.
And that isn't true.
You know,
like I said,
I know,
I know people,

325
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:24.650
people who like guns and they're not that.
But the people who are not,

326
00:19:24.651 --> 00:19:29.270
that have to accept the fact that there is a population that is that,

327
00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:30.540
you know what I mean?
You,

328
00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:33.350
you can't say that they don't exist because they do exist.

329
00:19:33.351 --> 00:19:37.940
So I big part of this,
I think like any other issue,
Joe,

330
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:42.050
we got to start telling each other the truth.
You know what I mean?

331
00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:46.580
About about these issues.
Like we,
everyone has their,

332
00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:47.900
their side,
right?

333
00:19:47.901 --> 00:19:52.901
Or their tribe or their team and they refuse to believe any truth and you know,

334
00:19:54.231 --> 00:19:58.700
any,
any negative truth about their team or whatever,
you know what I mean?
Like,

335
00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:02.720
like,
like to say,
well,
like we were saying like gun owners.
Okay,

336
00:20:02.721 --> 00:20:06.740
so there's responsible gun owners and then there's a few gun blog and just use

337
00:20:06.741 --> 00:20:07.790
the term gun nuts.

338
00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:11.750
And a responsible gun owners have to accept the fact that there was some gun

339
00:20:11.751 --> 00:20:15.860
nuts,
right.
With the police.
The vast majority of police are good,

340
00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:20.230
but the good police have to say he had,
there were some bad cops too.
Right.

341
00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:24.530
You know what I mean?
Like,
like within any,
within it,
any trial were comics.

342
00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:28.010
We know there was some bad comics.
I don't know if you know a joke,

343
00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:32.320
but I'm going to put it out there.
I heard of a family.
But,

344
00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:37.160
but until we,
until we do that,
we can never have a real discussion,
right.

345
00:20:37.161 --> 00:20:41.060
Because everybody just suddenly circles the wagons around their heard and like,

346
00:20:41.061 --> 00:20:45.200
no,
no,
no,
nothing.
You know,
it's like,
no,
we're not saying all of you are bad,

347
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:49.900
but let's admit within your group there is bad.
So we can work on that.

348
00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.820
<v 1>Yeah.
I've seen some tweets from some,</v>

349
00:20:51.821 --> 00:20:56.640
a NRA supporters the last day and a half that are just fucking stunned me where

350
00:20:56.641 --> 00:20:58.180
it just shut the fuck up,
man.

351
00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:02.530
Just re realize what the state of all this is right now and shut the fuck up.

352
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:03.221
And by the way,

353
00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:06.880
there's a video that's going around that somebody put up about me talking about

354
00:21:06.881 --> 00:21:09.850
gun control is not a recent video.
I don't know when it's from,

355
00:21:09.851 --> 00:21:13.240
but people are putting it up now,
uh,
about me,
uh,

356
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:15.790
destroying the gun control argument.
Uh,
it's,

357
00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:19.720
it would be very insensitive for me to do that and put that up right now.

358
00:21:19.721 --> 00:21:22.750
And I didn't,
it had nothing to do with,
I don't know when it was,
I don't know.

359
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:27.460
I think it was from a year or so ago,
but,
but the idea that these people,

360
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:32.700
these NRA supporters would go and tweet these pro gun messages and get crazy

361
00:21:33.581 --> 00:21:35.990
with it now is exactly what you're saying.
They're digging their heels in.

362
00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:37.300
They're supporting their team.

363
00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:41.940
<v 0>Yeah.
And,
and as many people have been saying and,
and it is a sad truth.
Look,</v>

364
00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:47.070
if we didn't wake up after Sandy Hook,
then you know,
if,
if,
if,

365
00:21:47.071 --> 00:21:50.640
when 20,
what was it,
21 kids were shot.
Yeah.

366
00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:55.080
That and people denied that it happened to,
oh,
that didn't even happen at all.

367
00:21:55.081 --> 00:21:59.100
That,
you know what I mean?
People are calling this a false flag.
Right.
So,

368
00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:03.810
so if that didn't wake us up,
yeah.
Then you know,

369
00:22:03.811 --> 00:22:08.310
58 people at a music concert,
I hate to say it,
but it's like,

370
00:22:08.311 --> 00:22:12.540
it's not going to wake us up.
You know,
I have,
I have a thing waking stop.
Mean,

371
00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:15.830
you know,
I mean wake us up to the point of take some action,

372
00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:18.850
but what's the other thing?
A lot of precedent.
Alonzo,
what would you do the,

373
00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:23.250
the um,
well to start with,
we have to have the conversation.

374
00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.710
We have to have the conversation about,
they're just like we touched,

375
00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:30.000
talked about there isn't a necessary we,

376
00:22:30.001 --> 00:22:33.930
it is necessary to change our gun laws are gun laws are too lax.

377
00:22:33.931 --> 00:22:36.600
That's the first thing.
Then what we need to do,

378
00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:41.780
we need to come up with a system just like we have with cars or anything else

379
00:22:42.001 --> 00:22:45.780
dangerous where you,
you have to be trained to use it.

380
00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:50.280
You have to register whatever it is with the government and you have to have

381
00:22:50.281 --> 00:22:53.070
liability insurance and it,
and that,

382
00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:57.900
that information transfers.
Like the big loophole is the gun shows,
right?

383
00:22:57.901 --> 00:23:01.500
Where you go to the gun show and you could just sell a gun to another person.

384
00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:04.410
You can do that with all the case.
Yeah.
And a lot of states,

385
00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.470
that's still the case.
You can do that with a car,
right?

386
00:23:07.471 --> 00:23:09.930
I can sell you my car through craigslist,

387
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:13.740
but I'm still going to go put it in that a liability thing.

388
00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:16.260
Otherwise I'm liable for what you do with the car.

389
00:23:16.261 --> 00:23:21.120
Like I protect myself by reporting it even though I sold it to you party the

390
00:23:21.121 --> 00:23:24.960
party.
Yeah.
So,
so it,
yeah,
if I'm in charge,
we're going to,

391
00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:27.470
we're going to add those things.
We're going to get,

392
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:31.380
we're going to get a handle on these guns were going to get start tracking how

393
00:23:31.381 --> 00:23:36.300
many they are,
where they are.
We're going to collect them.
Um,

394
00:23:36.301 --> 00:23:39.810
I think it was Australia and some other places that had those things where,

395
00:23:39.811 --> 00:23:42.180
look Australia,
if you own an illegal weapon,

396
00:23:42.181 --> 00:23:46.550
like a fully automatic weapon or whatever makes it illegal,
you can turn it in.

397
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:50.150
Maybe there's payment or maybe it's just no questions asked.

398
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:53.390
Just turn it in and we'll,
we'll destroy it.
Well,

399
00:23:53.391 --> 00:23:55.730
what happened in Australia is they had a mass shooting and then they put their

400
00:23:55.731 --> 00:23:59.860
foot down and they said,
no mark,
I'll show you.
Just banned them all together.

401
00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:03.980
Totally ban them.
You can still use a rifle to hunt.
But,
um,

402
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:07.280
the way we have this sort of fast and loose po,

403
00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:12.170
there's very few countries in the world that have this kind of fast and loose

404
00:24:12.171 --> 00:24:16.520
gun policy.
I think.
Yeah,
we still have the wild west mentality.

405
00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:19.010
Well,
anybody have freedom mentality,

406
00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:23.570
which you bill Riley did a fucking had a post today where he's talking about

407
00:24:23.571 --> 00:24:28.070
that this is the cost of car.
The freedom.
Yeah.
Fucking crazy.
No,
it's not.

408
00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:31.250
Oh,
it's crazy old dickhead.
And I'll give you an example,
Joe.

409
00:24:31.251 --> 00:24:32.900
Like I grew up in New York City.

410
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.050
Like guns had been illegal in New York City for a long time.

411
00:24:36.051 --> 00:24:40.790
Now there are guns in New York City,
but not as many as people think,
you know,

412
00:24:40.791 --> 00:24:45.200
because what happens is when you make it illegal,
then the average person,

413
00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.990
they don't go out of their way to get a gun.
They're like,
no,
I'm not.

414
00:24:47.991 --> 00:24:50.210
I'm not going to have one.
Yeah,
a criminal is going to have guns.

415
00:24:50.211 --> 00:24:52.040
Yas Criminals are always going to have guns.

416
00:24:52.041 --> 00:24:55.370
But you know the thing about the good guy shooting the bad guy,

417
00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.380
it doesn't happen that often.

418
00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:02.950
And my personal belief on this is because in that moment it takes a lot to shoot

419
00:25:03.171 --> 00:25:04.610
somebody.
It just happened the other day.

420
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:07.550
They just happened the other day and it was just saying that should happen.

421
00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.410
There was an active shooter somewhere that was taken out by a,

422
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.300
a good guy got on her.
It can happen.
You're right.

423
00:25:14.301 --> 00:25:17.780
It doesn't happen everywhere all the time,

424
00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:23.170
but it can happen in a lot of people get their guns stolen or taken away because

425
00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:27.170
in that moment they can't use it.
Sure.
And the criminal,

426
00:25:27.171 --> 00:25:30.200
he ain't got nothing to lose.
He's already a criminal,
you know what I mean?

427
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:33.920
Also probably used to violence.
Yeah.
A lot of people are not used to violence.

428
00:25:33.921 --> 00:25:35.460
There's a lot of soft people out there that just,

429
00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:38.780
they don't know what to do if the shit hits the fan in any way,
shape,
or form.

430
00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:42.740
I just don't know how to handle pressure.
Yeah.
And,
and it's,
you know,

431
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:46.670
that happens in the Nate,
so they buy a gun to protect themselves,

432
00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:50.720
but they're in no way equipped to use it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,
there's a lot of that.

433
00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:53.780
They're hoping that they can use it or to scare people off or something like

434
00:25:53.781 --> 00:25:57.920
that.
But most likely,
yeah,
they're not going to be able to do it.
But you know,

435
00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:00.020
then there's people that say,
well that's them.

436
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.610
I want the option because I will be able to figure it out.
You know,

437
00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:07.430
because I'm not a pussy or I'm not.
Then there's a legal way to get one.
You know,

438
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:11.090
you do what it takes to and you register it.
And again,

439
00:26:11.091 --> 00:26:12.710
most gun owners that I know,

440
00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:16.160
and I may be wrong cause it's not like I'm deep in the gun culture,

441
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:18.080
so I'm not speaking with that expertise.

442
00:26:18.081 --> 00:26:22.760
I'm just talking about of the people I know who have guns who are into guns and

443
00:26:22.761 --> 00:26:23.480
shooting.

444
00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:27.780
I only have one friend who's like doesn't want to register his guns or or

445
00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:28.730
anything like that.

446
00:26:28.731 --> 00:26:31.840
Most of them I know they're fine with having their gun residue.

447
00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:35.780
One friend's argument,
I couldn't even tell you.

448
00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:38.570
I honestly couldn't it.
I love him,
I love him.

449
00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.600
But it's crazy when it comes to guns.
He's got a little,

450
00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.160
he's got some of that paranoia.
He's got some of that.

451
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:47.280
The government's out to get me government.
Her.
No,
and then you know,

452
00:26:47.281 --> 00:26:51.660
his thing with,
um,
we were talking about,
and I know it's the wrong term,

453
00:26:51.661 --> 00:26:56.040
but it's the common term assault weapons,
assault type weapons.
Right.

454
00:26:56.430 --> 00:27:00.240
And he said like,
yeah,
well what if there's a home invasion?
That's what they use.

455
00:27:00.241 --> 00:27:04.480
And now it's like,
hey,
nobody invading your broke ass home.
You Ain't getting,

456
00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.120
you still want to get your guns.
You know what I mean?
You got,
you got,
you know,

457
00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:10.860
you had average American would a two bedroom in the suburbs.

458
00:27:10.861 --> 00:27:14.910
Ain't nobody invading your shit.
Right.
You ain't got a safe,
if you selling crack,

459
00:27:14.911 --> 00:27:17.310
you might want to worry,
you might have some cash around the house,

460
00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:20.550
even if you were a good marijuana distributed,
it'd be a bunch of cash.

461
00:27:20.551 --> 00:27:24.240
You're not allowed to put in the bank,
but you ain't nobody invading your house.

462
00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:29.250
Yeah.
Everybody wants to be John Wick.
Yeah.
Yeah.

463
00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:39.350
<v 3>Okay.</v>
