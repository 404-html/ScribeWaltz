00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.230
Warren,
Keith Ellison,
real hard left progressive stuff.

2
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.190
It is rooted in identity politics,
which I,
you know we've done already,

3
00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:10.890
but like it is rooted in something that separates us.

4
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.280
It is rooted that you should that even today.
Did you see this?
That Harvard,

5
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:15.750
I just tweeted out when I was on the way here,

6
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.980
Harvard released this statement of defending the fact that they are okay with

7
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:24.210
basically having quotas that work against Asian students because they want to

8
00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:29.211
have more other minorities basically meaning black or Hispanic minorities.

9
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.630
So think about it.
Why would you discriminate if you are hiring right now,

10
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:36.870
let's say you're hiring today,
right?
You're hiring for your studio,

11
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.690
you're going to hire,
you can hire the most qualified person.

12
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:42.810
Are you going to try to figure out every little identity thing to figure out who

13
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:46.090
you should hire?
Diversity,
Bro,
I'm all about diversity.

14
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.380
Exactly that it's racist against Asians.

15
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.990
Just [inaudible] been very vocal about it cause they,

16
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.100
they tend to just put their fucking nose to the grindstone and keep ticking out.

17
00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:59.580
So they have to use that against them.
Now that works.
So that's the new thing.

18
00:00:59.581 --> 00:01:02.130
You will not be a,
if you're Asian and you,
and why did they,

19
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.520
why did Asian Americans are Indian Americans are a great example that they have

20
00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:08.250
succeeded at every level that we measure success.

21
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.230
I think the highest socioeconomic average salary over a hundred grand,
you know,

22
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.540
education,
et Cetera,
et cetera.
If you now say,
well wait a minute,

23
00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:18.810
these people played by the rules,
they came here as it most,
you know,
like,

24
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.290
like all of our ancestors virtually came here pretty much with nothing.

25
00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:25.770
People in small businesses busted their ass,
worked in coal mines.

26
00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:28.920
It's that wherever you had to do it,
if you do all of those things,

27
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:32.100
and then you focus on education and on family and all of those things,

28
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.060
and now the system is gonna say,
well,
it worked for a while,

29
00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:38.190
but we're going to have to put you at the bottom of the thing now.

30
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.040
And you guess what?
You're not going to get into Harvard because you're Asian.

31
00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:44.790
That is racism.
So I've been calling this out for at least two years,

32
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.090
that the next move by this identity politics,

33
00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:52.470
this evil oppression Olympics machine is that they will come after Asian people

34
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:55.920
and it's starting to happen now.
So I see all these minorities,
by the way.

35
00:01:55.921 --> 00:01:56.754
So Candice,

36
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.820
who I watched the show and I know you guys definitely have disagreements on

37
00:01:59.821 --> 00:02:03.390
stuff as do I do when it comes not only to politics but tactics sometimes and

38
00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:06.330
stuff,
but I really do like her.
Um,
you know,
look,

39
00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:09.930
she's causing a massive rift in the black community and you can see it in the

40
00:02:09.931 --> 00:02:14.370
numbers.
Black male support for Trump or for Trump doubled it was at 11%.

41
00:02:14.371 --> 00:02:18.660
It's tiny too.
No one.
Well,
it's Kanye.
Kanye was the wrecking machine.

42
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.180
But I actually think,
I think in the grand scheme of things can't,

43
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.360
Candace is much bigger.
I really believe that in terms of,

44
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.860
because I think she could be a direct line to all of the political parts of this

45
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.470
if she decides to go that route because I think she could,

46
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.620
I think she could run for Senate or,
yeah.
Yeah.
I can't,

47
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.050
I'm not,
I'm not high today.

48
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.590
I'm only smoking maybe once a week on Sundays and now and now I'm on tour so I'm

49
00:02:43.591 --> 00:02:44.221
not really at all.

50
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:46.600
But I'll spark up a joint and have you reconsidered what you just said.

51
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.380
You can smoke a joint and maybe I'll reconsider.

52
00:02:49.381 --> 00:02:52.550
Send you watch the podcast I did with her.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah,
I watch.

53
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.880
I don't maybe at least at least an hour and a half of it or so.
Yeah.
Why?
Why?

54
00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.310
What?
I don't know why saying it that way.

55
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.110
Cause I don't think she should run for Senate.
No,
no.

56
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.610
I'm not saying she's a young girl with some interesting ideas and she's got a

57
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:10.810
lot of passion.
I didn't say you think she should.
I even say,
I think she said,

58
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.650
I think she could have a bigger effect.
Even then Kanye,

59
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:18.880
when it comes to just everything going on politically.
This girl,

60
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.210
she wants it.
She wants it,
man.
I'm sure she does.

61
00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:24.460
But when you share affecting people in a big way,

62
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.810
I think maybe in a bigger way than,
than perhaps either one of us understand.

63
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.710
But my,
but forgetting Candace specifically my point,

64
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:34.990
my point was nice person.
Yeah.

65
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.920
My point was though that I think all minority groups are reevaluating what's

66
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:40.410
going on here.
If you're in the black community,

67
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.650
clearly there is at the moment a reevaluation of do we have to be democratic?

68
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.750
If you're,
that is an issue.
Yeah.
It's a,
it's a racist issue.
Yes.

69
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.540
Because people assume that if you're black,
you must be a democrat.
If you're not,

70
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:55.100
you're some sort of an uncle Tom.
Yeah.
It's kind of fucked up.
Yeah.

71
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.470
Talk to my friends Larry Elder.

72
00:03:56.471 --> 00:03:59.380
I had Thomas all on the show or my buddy David Webb or,
or many of,

73
00:03:59.381 --> 00:04:02.110
there are many black conservatives.
Sure.

74
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.560
You are allowed to think however you want despite your skin color.
Right.

75
00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:08.440
So I think the black community,
Ben Carson,
I mean,

76
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.480
I think the black community starting to split,

77
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:14.530
I think the gay community starting to split because the left has sort of had

78
00:04:14.531 --> 00:04:17.800
this odd embracement of Islam,
which is bad for gays.

79
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.060
So I think the gays are starting to split.
I think that,
uh,

80
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.490
Latinos are even starting to split a little bit differently because I think for

81
00:04:24.491 --> 00:04:26.050
all the people that came here legally,

82
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.770
they're actually not as thrilled with illegal immigration as the media may imply

83
00:04:29.771 --> 00:04:30.550
that they are.

84
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.030
So I think there's just massive shifts happening all over the place.

85
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.680
And the way we look at voting where every election,
you know,

86
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.130
what's his name?
John King goes on CNN and shows you the map and it goes,
well,

87
00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:45.280
the white working class people here voted this way and the black inner city

88
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:48.160
people.
But I think all of that is about to explode.

89
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.310
And they won't know what to do because they haven't been listening.

90
00:04:51.311 --> 00:04:53.770
But I think some others have them.
Listen.
