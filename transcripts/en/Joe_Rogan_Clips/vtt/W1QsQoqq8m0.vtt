1
00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.860
Mexico decriminalize a lot of drugs,

2
00:00:02.861 --> 00:00:06.650
like fairly recently that a big supreme court decision aspect a lot of time in

3
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.140
Mexico.
And I,
you know,
I think about,

4
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.670
I think about this time I spent in Mexico really often it because it was,

5
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.920
I'm going to cover it.
I,
you know,
been to a lot of bad places.

6
00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:23.890
I covered the war in the Congo.
I've been to Iraq,
I've been to Gaza.

7
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.310
I've never seen anything like what happened to horrors when,
when I was there,

8
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.450
the,
you know,
I think it's worth explaining.

9
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.740
So when you
luck,

10
00:00:35.741 --> 00:00:38.410
I was saying when you ban drugs then it disappear,
right?

11
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.970
The transplant to armed criminal gangs.

12
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.300
If you live in a housing project in the United States where 5% of the economy of

13
00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:47.320
that housing project is in the hands of armed criminal gangs,

14
00:00:47.321 --> 00:00:50.990
that's going to be a shitty,
frightening place to be.
Right?
Place like C.
Dot.

15
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.380
Juarez,
which is on the border with board,

16
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.600
Mexican side of the United States border with them.

17
00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.580
It's the other side with our Paso.
Um,
by the time I went there,

18
00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:01.720
it was 70%,

19
00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:05.230
seven 0% of the economy was in the hands of these armed criminal gangs.
Right.

20
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.510
So I remember
going to see this guy,
Ross Saleo Retta,

21
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.030
uh,
interview people about him and horrors.
But then I went to,

22
00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:18.031
he's in prison in the United States is in Tyler County and Rosalia it's

23
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.850
interesting guys.

24
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.530
He butchered or beheaded about 70 people between the ages of 13 and 17.

25
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.580
Um,
I'm going into the prison actually to see him and the guard said to me on the

26
00:01:27.581 --> 00:01:31.320
way in,
but obviously I can't leave you alone with him cause he's like a shit.

27
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.070
All these people.
I was like,
oh great,
thanks.

28
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.130
And we have about five minutes until around the guard was fucking God.

29
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.840
But I'm saying we've Rozalia talking about his life and his,
his,

30
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.640
his story.
So Rozalia grew up in Laredo,
Texas side of the border.

31
00:01:45.641 --> 00:01:49.600
It's basically the same places,
Nuevo Laredo on the,
on the Mexican side.

32
00:01:49.601 --> 00:01:51.310
It was very easy to cross the border at that time.

33
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.470
Secret he was growing up in the,
the late nineties.
Noughties remember Sally?

34
00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.190
I was 13.
So loads get the Zetas were kind of famous drug gang at that time.

35
00:02:00.191 --> 00:02:03.580
They still are a good drug cartel.
How does eight hours were created?

36
00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:05.560
It's an insane story.
Every tax payer should know.

37
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.600
The US government decided to train and elite anti drug force for the,

38
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.860
for the Mexican government,
right?

39
00:02:11.861 --> 00:02:15.610
Like kind of navy seals for the anti-drug force or they take them to Fort Bragg.

40
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.150
They spent something like $250 million training them up,
they go back to Mexico.

41
00:02:19.151 --> 00:02:21.520
Six months later they all defected on mass.

42
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.700
Almost all of them are created a drug cartel.
There's eight is great.

43
00:02:24.701 --> 00:02:29.290
You see your tax money.
Um,
so the Zetas were this kind of a glamorous,

44
00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:32.620
in inverted commas,
drug gang operating on that part of the border.

45
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.800
Drug routes move around according to where they put policing.

46
00:02:35.801 --> 00:02:38.650
It always gets through,
but it moves,
right?
They call it the balloon effect.

47
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.270
Imagine a balloon half full of air.
You pushed down one pace,

48
00:02:41.271 --> 00:02:42.370
the air comes up somewhere else.

49
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.570
But at that time it was going through a Juarez and El Paso and Laredo,

50
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.650
Nuevo Laredo.
And Rosario.

51
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.150
So there's two stories about how Asalia gets involved with the Zetas.

52
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.460
What Russell Leo says is he was basically kidnapped by them and forced to start

53
00:02:57.461 --> 00:03:01.150
killing people.
I don't think that's true.
If you look at the evidence,
it's the,

54
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:03.070
he sort of volunteered,
but he's 13,

55
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:07.030
so I don't hold him morally responsible for that.
But either way,

56
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.860
there's one night it all begins.

57
00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:13.630
He's taken on the Mexican side of the border to a warehouse where they are

58
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.000
torturing people,
burning them alive.

59
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.910
He's given a gun by guy called Miguel Trevino,

60
00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:22.000
who later became the head of the Zetas and he's told to shoot someone in the

61
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:24.460
head.
And that's the moment you're in.
And when you're in with the Zetas,

62
00:03:24.461 --> 00:03:28.900
you'd never get out right there.
No one leaves.
Um,
no one leaves alive.

63
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.600
Uh,
and so they begin to train him.

64
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.740
He sent to us in 2005 he sent to a summer camp that's literally account for the

65
00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:38.620
teachers.
You have to behead people and do all sorts of things.

66
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.600
And he's then sent him and his friends are then sent to

67
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.620
murder people is with friends,
Jessie and Gabriel,

68
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.490
they murder huge numbers that they were called within the Zetas called these

69
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:55.090
child soldiers the expendables,
cause they don't give a shit if they live or die.

70
00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:58.150
Right.
The,
there's one person said to me,

71
00:03:58.151 --> 00:04:00.760
they prefer children because they don't understand death so well.
Right.

72
00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:03.670
Obviously it's for solid.
Got a bit older.
He understood death better.

73
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.660
All his friends get murdered,
eventually tries to get back to the US.

74
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.670
He cooperates.
He now lives in solitary confinement where he will live,

75
00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:11.890
but the rest of his life,
because when they let him out of solitary,

76
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.450
shortly before I met him,
he was immediately stabbed in the neck.
Um,

77
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.480
and again,
you think about this insane violence that we created,

78
00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:25.870
right when I went to Hawaii,
it's this bizarre thing.
So that time it wasn't,

79
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.640
you were told it wasn't quite rightly,

80
00:04:27.641 --> 00:04:29.320
it wasn't safe to stay in horror as overnight.

81
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.290
So I would stay overnight in El Paso and I'd walk across the bridge right

82
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.640
through,
through your shift passport.
I remember the customs people going,

83
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:41.120
what the fuck are you going into?
Juarez.
But go,
go in there.
It's weird.

84
00:04:41.121 --> 00:04:43.780
On on the other side of the bridge,

85
00:04:43.781 --> 00:04:47.170
there's this sign and it says welcome to historic downtown Juarez.

86
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.590
And it used to be a tourist site.
Billie holiday got married there.
But um,

87
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.390
now it's just that time it was just covered with images of missing women,

88
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.030
just everywhere.

89
00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:01.060
Because this is another really important part of what this violence doesn't

90
00:05:01.061 --> 00:05:02.230
think.
It's really important.

91
00:05:02.231 --> 00:05:06.640
We understand this is the violence caused by the system that we uphold and we

92
00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:10.390
imposed on Mexico.
Mexicans do not want this.
Right?
So there's another story.

93
00:05:10.391 --> 00:05:13.420
I think of all the stories I wrote about for chasing the scream along with one

94
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:16.240
other one I can tell you about if you want.
This was the hardest.

95
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.320
So woman in horrors.
Um,

96
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.590
when the drug war violence starts to go through called Maricella Escobedo,

97
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.940
she was a,
a nurse,
but Marissa was incredibly hardworking.

98
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.230
So she also would do these,
um,

99
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.080
I would just call them like woodcarvings basically.

100
00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:34.300
And she would sell them in the market on Saturdays and Sundays.

101
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.630
She had three kids.
My youngest daughter was called Ruby.

102
00:05:37.631 --> 00:05:41.410
She was 14 at the time and they would work on this stall in the marketplace

103
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.100
every Saturday,
I think maybe on Sundays as well,
some Sundays.

104
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.710
And one day a guy comes up to Mary Seller store called Sergio.

105
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.240
He was a young guy who was like 21.
Um,
and he's like,
you just had a baby.

106
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.590
He needs a job.
Marcella was kind of soft hearted.

107
00:05:57.591 --> 00:05:59.810
She gives him a job working on her market though.

108
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.680
And a few months later she discovers tower horror that he's having sex with a 14

109
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:07.100
year old daughter Ruby.
And she's like,

110
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.980
fires him immediately and goes to the police and says,

111
00:06:09.981 --> 00:06:13.760
you need to go and question him.
Right.
And He's 21,
she's 14.
This is a crime.

112
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.820
Police don't do anything.
She doesn't understand it.
What,

113
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:21.800
why are they not investigating this?
Her daughter starts running away to be with,

114
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.670
with Sergio.
Um,
Maricella keeps going to get her back.

115
00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:27.530
She keeps going to the police saying this is a crime.

116
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.290
He can't live with a 14 year old go and arrest and they will do anything rash.

117
00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:34.220
She completely puzzled by this.
Then Ruby gets pregnant.

118
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.770
Marcel is like fishes 15 by then it's like fuck,

119
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:40.910
I got to keep her in my life so she,
she keeps going to see ruby.

120
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.270
By this time she was kind of accepted the police on with real rage that police

121
00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:47.570
aren't going to do an it thing and one day just after the baby was born,

122
00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:51.530
she goes to see Ruby and Sergio's there with the baby and he says,

123
00:06:51.531 --> 00:06:56.360
I'm a ruby has run away with another man.
She's gone.
She's not coming back.

124
00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.820
Marisol is like,
what?
I left her baby.
No,
she hasn't done it.

125
00:07:00.821 --> 00:07:03.710
I know she hasn't done that.
I know my daughter.
He's like,
well she's gone.

126
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.180
So Marisol awaits.
Christmas comes,
no message.
New Year comes,
no message.

127
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.040
She starts to go to the neighborhood and hand out leaflets with pictures of our

128
00:07:13.041 --> 00:07:13.610
daughter.

129
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.250
Loads of women are going missing in Horace at this time or Taiwan minute.

130
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.980
I'm just saying,
have you seen this go?

131
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.240
And after a few days she gets a call from a kid called an hell who says,

132
00:07:23.241 --> 00:07:26.330
I'm really frightened to tell you something.
If you drive me out into the desert,

133
00:07:26.331 --> 00:07:31.020
I'll tell you.
So she drives an hell out into the desert.
I think he was 14.
Um,

134
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.310
and he says,
um,
Sergio murdered your daughter.

135
00:07:34.311 --> 00:07:36.530
And he made me help him dispose of the body.

136
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.600
And he told Maricella where the body was.

137
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.620
It was actually a place where they dumped a pig carcasses from the AB 12.

138
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.110
She goes and she finds the body with,
with a son,

139
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.640
and she goes to the police and the police finally do something and they arrest

140
00:07:49.641 --> 00:07:54.230
Sergio.
Sergio's put on trial in the witness box.
He breaks down,

141
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.320
admits he did it and apologizes to Maricella.

142
00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.450
And then a few weeks later he's acquitted of all charges and disappears.

143
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.420
And Marisol is like,
what the fuck is going on here?

144
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.230
So she starts to look into this and she discovers,

145
00:08:08.231 --> 00:08:12.350
and this is the work intersects with the drug war and really important way that

146
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.620
the Sergio was a member of the Zetas.
Right?
Now,

147
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.950
if you remember the Zetas at that time in horror as his different acts and other

148
00:08:18.951 --> 00:08:22.940
drug gangs displaced them,
you own the state,
right?

149
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.180
And you have,
if they control 70% of the economy,

150
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.510
you have more money than the government,
right?
So the police worked for them.

151
00:08:29.511 --> 00:08:32.210
When I went to go into be Rozalia,
he said,
when I would go murder people,

152
00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:35.330
the police would,
would come with me.
They would dispose of the body,
right?

153
00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.090
And number three is great.
And what year are we talking about?

154
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.560
This is like six years ago.
I remember the,
the,
the,
the tea.
I'm a,

155
00:08:41.561 --> 00:08:44.000
but it's actually because one of the things,
when you're in a dangerous place,

156
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.530
when you're,
when you're in a dangerous place,

157
00:08:45.531 --> 00:08:48.920
one of the things you do is you read danger from how frightened the people

158
00:08:48.921 --> 00:08:51.920
around you are,
right?
Because you don't know the place I was.
I mean,

159
00:08:51.921 --> 00:08:54.950
I was there with Julio and Cardona who is my fixer,
who's an amazing,

160
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.080
he's the Reuters corresponding wires,
one of the bravest people I've ever met.

161
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:03.470
But it was realizing how frightened other people were for me and Leanne,

162
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.570
right?
And I remember after being there for few days,

163
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.580
helion kept introducing mean by that time,

164
00:09:11.581 --> 00:09:14.610
the killings were basically all being done by the police.
And it was saying,

165
00:09:14.611 --> 00:09:15.444
you know who Leon,
this is,

166
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.750
this is important that I meet people who've been killed by the police,

167
00:09:18.751 --> 00:09:20.640
but I should also meet people who have been killed by the cartels,

168
00:09:20.641 --> 00:09:23.070
more recent knee.
And he said that he just laughed and said,
no,
that's,

169
00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:26.010
that's not how it works here I had now,
if the cartels want to kill someone,

170
00:09:26.011 --> 00:09:29.370
they just pay the police to do it,
right?
So it's this real realization,
all right,

171
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.520
someone comes to you,
there is nowhere for you to go,
right?

172
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:36.690
So Mary Seller refuses to accept that she lives in a country where there is no

173
00:09:36.691 --> 00:09:40.110
justice.
She decides,
okay,
they're not going to solve this.

174
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:41.550
I'm going to solve this.

175
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.780
She appealed low loads of women are missing because it turns out if a bunch of

176
00:09:45.781 --> 00:09:47.640
criminals control the state,
they will just Myrdal.

177
00:09:47.641 --> 00:09:48.870
Those are women and get away with it,
right?

178
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:51.450
There are some men who just want to murder women and if they give them license

179
00:09:51.451 --> 00:09:53.910
to do it,
they'll do it.
That's why so many women we're missing.

180
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.130
Maricela gathers a load of those mothers.

181
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.990
She says some of them don't know where their daughters are.

182
00:09:57.991 --> 00:10:00.570
Some of them know their daughters are dead.
She's like,
I need your help.

183
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.110
We're going to find this guy who's done this right?

184
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:09.090
So Mary Seller Tans herself with these women into a detective.

185
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:13.920
She starts tracking Sergio all over Mexico,
wherever there are sightings,

186
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.640
she walks everywhere.
She walks over a thousand miles,
right?

187
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:21.030
She walks through the desert.
It becomes a media phenomenon.
People follow her.

188
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:22.040
She's like this,

189
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.700
this symbol of the loss that's happened in Mexico and incredibly with the Front

190
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:31.440
Berta,
Alysia Garcia,
who I got to know later,
after two years,
she finds Sergio.

191
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:35.880
She tracks him down.
She goes to the police,
she tells them where he is,

192
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.930
they tip him off and he disappears.
I,
she's devastated.

193
00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:43.590
So she decided she's going to go to the governor's mansion in Chihuahua.
Uh,

194
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.700
it's the state capitol.

195
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:50.490
She goes there and she sets up 10 outside the governor's mansion,

196
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.480
and she's like,
I'm not leaving here until you people go and find this man.

197
00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:59.850
And she calls on every mother who has a daughter who's missing or who they're

198
00:10:59.851 --> 00:11:03.870
afraid of four to come and join her in this fight.
Right?

199
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:09.120
And it gets to Christmas Eve and she's preparing to it just before Christmas.

200
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:11.190
Isn't Christmas Eve.
I'm going to have this big Christmas dinner here.

201
00:11:11.191 --> 00:11:15.690
People can join me.
She gives this great speech and a man walks up,

202
00:11:15.691 --> 00:11:18.630
turned ships are in the head,
in front of all the police.
Everyone.
