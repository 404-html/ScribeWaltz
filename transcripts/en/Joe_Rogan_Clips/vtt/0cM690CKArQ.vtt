00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.110
Hey,
but is,

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.080
I mean ultimately is it making people happier right now?

3
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.510
Most technology I would say no.
In fact,

4
00:00:08.511 --> 00:00:12.890
you and I were talking about social media before this about just not having

5
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.260
Instagram on your phone and not dealing with it.
You feel better.

6
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.210
<v 1>Yes.
I think that one of the issues with social media,</v>

7
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.370
it's been pointed out by many people.
Is that right?

8
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:23.653
<v 2>MMM.</v>

9
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.440
<v 1>I think maybe particularly Instagram.
Um,</v>

10
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.750
people look like they have a much better life than they really do,

11
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.420
right?
By design.
Yeah.

12
00:00:35.421 --> 00:00:38.300
People are posting pictures of when they were really happy,

13
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.840
they're modifying those pictures to be better looking in with,

14
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.150
they're not modifying the pictures there.

15
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.070
At least selecting the pictures for the best lighting,
the best angle.
Um,

16
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.500
so people basically seem

17
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.770
they're way better looking than they basically really are.
Right.
Um,

18
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.710
and they're way happier seeming than they really are.

19
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.040
So if you look at everyone on Instagram,
you might think,
man,

20
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.570
there are all these happy,

21
00:01:05.571 --> 00:01:10.280
beautiful people and I'm not that good looking and I'm not happy,

22
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.350
so I must suck,
you know,
and that's going to make feel sad.

23
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.970
So when in fact those people you think are super happy,

24
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.500
actually not that happy.
Some of them are really depressed.
They're very sad.

25
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.630
<v 2>Okay.</v>

26
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.320
<v 1>So I'm the happiest Syrian people actually some of the saddest people in
reality.</v>

27
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.270
Um,
and,
and,
and nobody looks good all the time.

28
00:01:35.271 --> 00:01:39.890
Doesn't matter who you are.
No,
it's not even something you should want.

29
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.170
What do you want to look great.
All the time.
Yeah,
exactly.
So,
uh,

30
00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:45.651
so I think,

31
00:01:45.651 --> 00:01:49.760
I think things like that can make people quite sad just just by comparison.

32
00:01:49.761 --> 00:01:51.260
Cause you,
you just sort of,
you know,
people,

33
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.390
people generally think of themselves relative to two others.
It's,
it's uh,

34
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.130
we're constantly re we baselining our expectations.

35
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:02.763
<v 2>MMM.</v>

36
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.690
<v 1>And you can see this,</v>

37
00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:09.160
say if you watch some show like naked and afraid or if you just go and try

38
00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:12.130
living in the woods by yourself for a while and you'll like

39
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.940
go learn that civilization was quite great.
Has Lots,

40
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.470
a lot of it is people want to come back civilization pretty fast on naked and

41
00:02:20.471 --> 00:02:24.400
afraid.
Wasn't that a Thoreau quote?
The comparison's,
the thief of joy

42
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.240
of happiness is reality minus expectations.

43
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.120
<v 0>That's great too,</v>

44
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.360
but the comparison is the thief of joy really holds true to peep.

45
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.630
Is it date or Roosevelt?
Roosevelt.
Fascinating.
Um,

46
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.500
and when you think about Instagram,

47
00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:44.270
because would essentially Instagram is with a lot of people is you're giving

48
00:02:44.271 --> 00:02:49.271
them the opportunity to be their own PR agent and they always go towards the

49
00:02:49.311 --> 00:02:53.070
glamorous,
you know,
and when any anybody does show,
you know,

50
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.570
Hashtag no filter I have,
they have,
they really do do that.
Like,
oh,

51
00:02:56.571 --> 00:03:00.430
you're so brave.
Lucky you don't make up.
No.
Yeah,

52
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.550
they look good anyway.
You look great.
We doing,
oh my God,

53
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:05.800
you don't have makeup on still a cottage.
Fuck.
Do you know what you're doing?

54
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.190
I know what you're doing too.
They're there.
They're letting you know.

55
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.130
And then the feeding off that comment section.
Ooh,

56
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.900
just little kits sitting there like,
look,
it's a fresh stream of love.

57
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.510
Like you're getting right up to the source as it comes out of the earth and

58
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:23.920
you're sucking that water.
Emojis.
Yeah.

59
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.690
Literally my,

60
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:29.230
what my concern is not so much what Instagram is,

61
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.090
is that I didn't think that people had the need for this or the expectation for

62
00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:37.510
some sort of technology that allows them to constantly get love and adulation

63
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:42.511
from strangers and comments and this ability to project this sort of distorted

64
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:45.730
version of who you really are.
But I worry about where it goes.

65
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.390
Like what's the next one?
What's the next one?
Like where is it?

66
00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:53.530
Is it going to be augmented to some sort of a weird augmented or virtual sort of

67
00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:57.580
Instagram type situation where you're not going to want to live in this real

68
00:03:57.581 --> 00:03:58.180
world.

69
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.690
You're going to want to interface with this sort of world that you've created

70
00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:05.170
through your social media page and some next level thing.

71
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.860
Go live in the simulation.
Yeah,

72
00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:12.160
maybe some ready player one type shit that's real.

73
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.930
That seems we have that HTC Vive here and I've only done it a couple of times

74
00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:20.680
quite honestly cause it kind of freaks me out.
My kids fucking love it man.

75
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:21.783
They love it.

76
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.350
They love playing these Weirdo Games and and walking around with that headset
on.

77
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.020
But pardon me?
Watching them do it goes,
wow.

78
00:04:29.021 --> 00:04:31.690
I wonder if this is like the precursor,

79
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.030
just sort of like if you look at that phone,

80
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:37.600
that Gordon Gekko hat on the beach and then you compare that Alpha,
yeah.

81
00:04:37.601 --> 00:04:41.560
You pair that to like a galaxy note nine I how the fuck did that become that?

82
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.040
Right.

83
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.660
And I wonder when I see this HTC vibe and like what is that thing going to be 10

84
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:50.410
years from now when we're making fun of what it is now?
What is it,
how,

85
00:04:50.411 --> 00:04:53.710
I mean how ingrained and how,
how,

86
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.390
how connected and interconnected is this technology going to be in our life?

87
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.490
<v 1>Yeah.
Will be</v>

88
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.630
at some point indistinguishable from reality

89
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.650
<v 0>where we'll lose this.
We're lose this.</v>

90
00:05:09.651 --> 00:05:11.600
Like you and I are just looking at show through our eyes.
Hi.

91
00:05:11.601 --> 00:05:13.850
See you when you see me I think,
I hope you think so.

92
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.990
I think you probably have brought up regularize.
This could be some simulation.

93
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:19.970
It could.
Do you entertain that?

94
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.073
<v 1>Well,</v>

95
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.080
the argument for the simulation I think is quite strong because if you assume

96
00:05:29.421 --> 00:05:33.650
any improvements at all over time and improvement,

97
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.160
1% 0.1% just extend the timeframe,

98
00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.290
make it a thousand years and million years.

99
00:05:39.291 --> 00:05:41.420
The Universe is 13.8 billion years old.

100
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.260
<v 3>Okay,</v>

101
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.400
<v 1>what would it w w civilization if you counted,
if you're very generous,</v>

102
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.180
civilization is maybe seven or 8,000 years old.

103
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.680
If you count it from the first writing,
this is nothing.
This says nothing.

104
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.133
Um,

105
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.570
<v 0>so if you assume any rate of improvement at all,</v>

106
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.910
then games will be indistinguishable from reality

107
00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.170
or civilization will end one of those two things will occur.

108
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.330
Oh four we are most likely in a simulation or we're on our way to one.

109
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.620
Right?
Well it's just we could most certainly be on the road.

110
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:28.870
We could be on the road to that,
right?

111
00:06:28.871 --> 00:06:31.300
It doesn't mean that it has to have her be in base reality.

112
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:32.620
It could be in base reality.

113
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.680
We could be here now on our way to the road or on her way to the destination

114
00:06:39.191 --> 00:06:40.870
where this can never happen again.

115
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.730
Where we are completely ingrained in some sort of an artificial technology or

116
00:06:45.731 --> 00:06:49.810
some sort of a symbiotic relationship with the internet or the next level of

117
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:54.310
sharing information,
but right now we're not there yet.
That's possible too.
Right?

118
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.210
It's possible that a simulation is one day going to be inevitable that we're

119
00:06:58.211 --> 00:07:00.850
going to have something that's indistinguishable from regular reality,

120
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.190
but maybe we're not there yet.
That's also possible

121
00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.930
when you're not quite there yet.
That this is real.

122
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.270
When I touched that feels very real.

123
00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.910
Maybe that's why everybody's like getting to like mason jars and shit.

124
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.950
Mason suede shoes.

125
00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.430
People are to like craft restaurants and they wouldn't want raw wood.

126
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.950
Everyone says everyone not to see metal people.

127
00:07:19.951 --> 00:07:24.480
It seems like people are like longing towards some weird log cabin type

128
00:07:24.481 --> 00:07:25.980
nostalgia reality.
Yeah,

129
00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:30.090
like holding on like Klingon to start dragging their nails through the mud.

130
00:07:30.091 --> 00:07:33.540
Like don't take me a yes,
I want to walk.
But then,

131
00:07:33.541 --> 00:07:36.570
but then people will go get a mason jar with a wine stem or a handle

132
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.800
that's dark makes me lose faith in humanity.
Wine,
stem and a handle.

133
00:07:42.801 --> 00:07:46.550
They have those.
Oh,
the sturdy people.
That's just assholes.

134
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.220
That's like people make pet rocks rough.
Right.
This is,

135
00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:53.240
some people are just assholes.
They take advantage of our generous nature.

136
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:58.070
It was made with the Weinstein I made with Andell.
They made it that way.

137
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.420
So the,
the one on to the Macy's.
Ah,

138
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:06.850
you felt that would be fine if there was like glued it on or something.
Right.

139
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:11.690
It was made that way.
White trash sheet.
Oh this is disgusting.
It is right there.

140
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.650
Yup.
This is terrible.
Yeah.

141
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:21.170
That's like fake breasts that are designed to be hard like fake breasts from the

142
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:22.003
60s.

143
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:29.840
It's like if you really long for the ones with ripples,
here we go.
Yeah.

144
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.470
That's almost what that is.
Yeah.
What are you going to do man?

145
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.410
This is not nothing,
you know,
it's not,

146
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.160
you can do stop certain terrible ideas from propagating.
Yeah.

147
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.530
Um,
anyway,
I,
I don't want to sound like,

148
00:08:44.531 --> 00:08:47.660
like thanks for two dark cause I think like you kind of have to

149
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.800
be optimistic about the future.
There's no point in being pessimistic.

150
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.710
It's just negative.

151
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.930
<v 1>It doesn't help,
you know,
I think you want to be,
I mean,</v>

152
00:09:00.931 --> 00:09:03.990
my theory is like you'd rather be optimistic.

153
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.770
I think I'd rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right,

154
00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.800
<v 0>right.
At least we're on that side.
Right?
Yeah.</v>

155
00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:15.370
Cause if you're pessimistic is going to be as this rule.
Yeah.

156
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.650
Yeah.
Nobody wants to be around you anyway.
If it's the end of the world,
you know,

157
00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:24.130
like a fucking told you bro.
Yeah.
The world's ending.
Yeah.

158
00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:28.600
It is way less Raul.
I mean enjoy the journey,
right?

159
00:09:28.601 --> 00:09:33.070
If you really want to get morose,
I mean it is what it is for all of us anyway.

160
00:09:33.071 --> 00:09:37.900
We were all going to go unless some something changes.
Yeah.
I mean ultimately,

161
00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:42.400
you know,
even if we just sort of existed as humans forever,
we'd be,

162
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.860
we'd still eventually,
that'd be like the heat death of the universe.
Right?

163
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.870
Your years from now,
if we get a pass the sun,

164
00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.350
if we figured out a way past the son running out of juice,

165
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.820
eventually it's going to end.
It's just a question of when.
Right.
So it really,

166
00:09:57.821 --> 00:09:58.750
it's all about the journey

167
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:04.780
or transcendence from whatever we are now into something that doesn't worry

168
00:10:04.781 --> 00:10:05.614
about death.

169
00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:07.350
<v 3>Okay.</v>

170
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:08.280
<v 1>The universe as we know,</v>

171
00:10:08.281 --> 00:10:13.281
it will dissipate into a fine mist of cold,

172
00:10:15.151 --> 00:10:16.440
nothing.
This eventually,

173
00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.800
<v 0>and then someone's going to bottle it and put a fragrance to it,</v>

174
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:23.720
sell it to French people and another dimension.
It's just a very long time.

175
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:28.160
So I think it's really just about how can we make it last longer.

176
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.030
Are you a proponent of the multiuniverse theory?

177
00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.560
Do you believe that there are many,

178
00:10:33.561 --> 00:10:36.320
many universes and that even if this one fades out,

179
00:10:36.321 --> 00:10:39.050
that there's other ones that are starting fresh right now and if there's an

180
00:10:39.051 --> 00:10:40.160
infinite number of them,

181
00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.940
they're just constantly and just never ending cycle of birth and death?

182
00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:53.240
<v 1>I think most likely,
this is just about probability.
There are many,</v>

183
00:10:53.241 --> 00:10:54.620
many simulations,

184
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:59.520
these simulations or we might as well call them reality or you could call them

185
00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:00.363
the multiverse.

186
00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:04.430
<v 0>These simulations you believe are created like someone has managed running on</v>

187
00:11:04.431 --> 00:11:05.264
the substrate,

188
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:11.070
<v 1>so that substrate is probably boring.
Boring.
How so?</v>

189
00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:16.590
Well when we create a simulation like a game or a movie,

190
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:21.400
it's the distillation of what's interesting about life.
You know like it,

191
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:22.613
it takes,

192
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:27.900
could take a year to shoot an action movie and then that's all distilled down

193
00:11:27.901 --> 00:11:31.530
into two or three hours.
So let me tell you,

194
00:11:31.531 --> 00:11:34.200
if you see an action movie being filmed,
frigging boring,

195
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:39.420
super boring takes,
there's like lots of takes those,

196
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:43.680
everything's in a green screen,
looks pretty goofy,
it doesn't look cool.

197
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:49.050
But once you add the CGI and have great editing,
it's amazing.

198
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:53.740
So I think most likely

199
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.380
<v 0>if we're a simulation,
it's really boring outside the simulation</v>

200
00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.560
because why would you make simulation that's boring cause make simulation way

201
00:12:04.561 --> 00:12:09.510
more interesting in the base reality that is if this right now is a simulation.

202
00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:13.410
Yes.
And ultimately,
inevitably we're,

203
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.630
if as long as we don't die or get hit by a media,

204
00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.090
we're going to create some sort of simulation.

205
00:12:18.091 --> 00:12:21.870
If we continue on the same technological path we're on,
we're on right now.
Yes.

206
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.530
But we might not be there yet.
So it might not be a simulation here,

207
00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:30.000
but it most likely is you feel other places,

208
00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:37.250
this notion of place or where is is a flawed yes.

209
00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.460
Flawed version.
If he has this sort of

210
00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.520
that a vive,

211
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:50.150
which that's made by valve and steam and H it's really valve that made it,

212
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:54.440
HTC did the hardware but it's really a valve thing.
Um,

213
00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:00.110
makers of halflife.
Yes.
Huh.
Wow.
Have Great Company,
Great Company.

214
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:01.383
Um

215
00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.900
<v 4>hmm.
Uh,</v>

216
00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:10.590
<v 0>when you're in that,
in that sense,
in that virtual reality,</v>

217
00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:14.670
which is only going to get better,
where are you?

218
00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:20.100
Where are you really?
Right?
You aren't anywhere.
Well,
whereas in the computer,

219
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:24.420
what w what defines where you are exactly right.
It's your perception.

220
00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.990
Is it your perceptions or is it,
you know,
a scale that we have under your butt.

221
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.580
You right here,
I've measured you.

222
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:31.260
You're the same weight as you were when you left,

223
00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.880
but you meanwhile your experience,

224
00:13:33.881 --> 00:13:36.540
why do you think you're where you are right now?
You might not be,

225
00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:37.883
I'll spark up joining.

226
00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:40.170
If you keep talking to your manager is going to come in here.

227
00:13:40.171 --> 00:13:43.920
We might have to lock the door right now.
You think you're in a studio in la?

228
00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.680
That's what I heard.
You might be in a computer.
Oh listen man,

229
00:13:46.681 --> 00:13:50.100
I think about this all the time.
Yeah.

230
00:13:50.101 --> 00:13:54.030
I mean it's unquestionable that one day that'll be the case.

231
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:57.660
As long as we keep going,
as long as nothing interrupts us.

232
00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:01.290
And if we start from scratch and you know,

233
00:14:01.291 --> 00:14:05.400
we're single celled organisms all over again and then millions and millions of

234
00:14:05.401 --> 00:14:08.850
years later would become the next thing that is us with creativity and the

235
00:14:08.851 --> 00:14:10.200
ability to change the environment.

236
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:14.160
It's going to keep monkeying with things until it figures out a way to change

237
00:14:14.161 --> 00:14:16.170
reality to change.

238
00:14:16.171 --> 00:14:21.171
I mean almost like punch a hole through what is this thing into what,

239
00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:24.570
what it wants it to be and create new things.

240
00:14:24.571 --> 00:14:27.870
And then those new things will intersect with other people's do things.

241
00:14:27.871 --> 00:14:32.871
And then there'll be this ultimate pathway of infinite ideas and expression all

242
00:14:33.421 --> 00:14:34.380
through technology.

243
00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:37.003
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

244
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:41.490
<v 0>And then we're wondering,
we're going to wonder like why are we here?</v>

245
00:14:41.491 --> 00:14:44.610
What are we doing?
Let's find out.

246
00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.170
I mean,
I think we should take the actions,

247
00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:54.780
the set of actions that are most likely to make the future better.
Yes.

248
00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:56.880
Right.
Yeah.
Right,
right.

249
00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:01.810
And then reevaluate those actions to make sure they're there.
That it's true.
Why.
