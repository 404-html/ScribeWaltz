1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.080
I'm going to Fry's and he's got like his reading glasses on and I said,
hey nick,

2
00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:06.690
what's up?
He'll call,
hey Joe,
I'm only,

3
00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:08.940
I'm trying to get out of computer from my kid.

4
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.930
You know anything about these fucking things.
That's really good.
Hey Joe.

5
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.610
It was weird.
It's like I'm talking to Nick Noti.

6
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.400
Should I get a Mac that was only like 27?
No,
still confused.
I'm still like,

7
00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:22.200
I can't believe I'm really talking to Nick Nolte.

8
00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:26.130
This ended up right now with Nelson Real.
This is real.
We're at FRY's.

9
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.690
Hey Man,
nick needs electronics too.
That was during my,

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.720
my quake days when I was addicted to quake and I'd make my own computers.

11
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.190
You like you did all that shit.
But Dude,

12
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.540
you have like bill 15 screens and all that shit.
Like everyone does that.
Yeah.

13
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.110
I had a broom in my house where I had a,
uh,

14
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.500
like a conference table and it was lined up with computer monitors.
It computers.

15
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.830
I used to build computers.
Mac,
you don't play any games anymore.

16
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.000
While we're going to,
we just got,

17
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.190
when we set up these origin pcs we got a land room set up.

18
00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:02.460
Local area network room.
Oh Shit.
Oh Shit.

19
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.050
All over the world fired up.
Well you know what man,

20
00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:11.100
now that we have the studio there's so much room here and my kids come here and

21
00:01:11.101 --> 00:01:15.570
play too.
You know there's plenty of stuff to do.
Yeah,
this is a lot.

22
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.380
Lots of so I'm just going to fuck it.

23
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.720
Put some games on for them but some games on for me.
Yeah that works.
I never got,

24
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.810
I never got into it for some reason video games I like I loved him when I was a

25
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:29.700
kid and then there was this weird cutoff and I was growing up now but so many

26
00:01:29.701 --> 00:01:34.440
people still play.
Yeah,
the non grownups,
those,
those non growing up guys.

27
00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:36.770
But I wish I could play like Jamie looking at him over there.

28
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.460
Take a big sweet kid.
Ultimate wear shirt.

29
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.710
It's like ultimate warrior shirt.
He's a fully grown man.

30
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.400
Chicks level to memorial dude.
They love guys who play video games too.
Right?

31
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.610
I had to sit inside all day.
Fuck yet.

32
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.450
Just button out too.

33
00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.380
So I want to get pale more pale.
I want to Paler.
I want to be Paler,
Jamie.

34
00:02:01.381 --> 00:02:05.340
The paler,
you know,
it scares the shit out of me though.
Those multi-role player,

35
00:02:05.341 --> 00:02:09.200
what does it multi those giant role player you call them?
Yeah.
What of it?

36
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.870
What's the name?
Massively multi on.
Massive multiplayer online role playing.

37
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.660
Is that what Fortnite is?
No,
I sound like a fucking dad done.

38
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.380
Don't laugh at me shooter.
It's a third person.

39
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.040
You third question but isn't there but aren't you with a massive community of

40
00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:24.320
people?
Yeah.
People.
Yeah.

41
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.270
That's fucking blows a hundred people in the game with you.
That's a lot,
dude.

42
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.330
Yeah.
Well that's a death match.
A quake death match.

43
00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:33.990
A lot of times he'd mutton really a hundred but it can be a hundred a hundred

44
00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:36.150
seems like it's absurd.
How many people are on your squat,

45
00:02:36.151 --> 00:02:40.380
on your team up to four oh 50 on 50 match,

46
00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:42.870
which is like a special,
is it random assignment to teams?

47
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:45.510
Are you going picking your team team or you can,

48
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.960
you actually can't go in random to,
you can do everything you want.
God,

49
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:50.340
I can't wait to hear the comments on this video,

50
00:02:50.341 --> 00:02:53.580
but coaches do not know about fort night.
Dude,
I get so mad.

51
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.730
I have no idea.
I see so many references online to it and I know what it is,

52
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.200
but I have no idea what it is.

53
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.210
I remember when people would call you a newb and they'd use for OCM.

54
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.140
NEWB fucking newb
still goes on.

55
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.470
Does it still goes,
oh shit.

56
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.270
Like today there's like maybe even right now there's $2 million tournaments

57
00:03:15.271 --> 00:03:18.150
going on.
There's one there.
I think they're both for charity today,

58
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.520
but one per fortnight and then another one,

59
00:03:20.521 --> 00:03:23.340
another game that's just like a called pub g,
which we've talked about before.

60
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.860
2 million bucks.
Yeah.
How long do they have to play?

61
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.160
It might be like a two or three hour tournament.
That's fucking unreal.

62
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.200
So much money in video games now.

63
00:03:31.201 --> 00:03:33.690
Parents used to tell their kids and not play video games,

64
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.750
like you don't don't be a loser.
And they still have that shit in their hand,

65
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.410
but it's,

66
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.970
there's more money in it then like most games people make careers out of it.

67
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.330
What if there were a tennis player?
Oh,
Bobby's a pro tennis player.

68
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.060
Bobby might blow his fucking ankles out.

69
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.340
Timmy over there is making $1 billion playing fort night and like you to do is

70
00:03:52.341 --> 00:03:56.100
move his hands this all day.
I knew what college,
I know a guy,

71
00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.830
a friend of my old roommate,
my first roommate in La.

72
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.600
He was like a PR professional online Gamer and I thought I was like,
what?

73
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.640
That dude fatality reached out to us.
Jonathan Wendell.
If they tell it,

74
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.200
I'm going to try to get them on.
I forgot it.
He's still playing.

75
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.580
He was the greatest quick player or one of the the,
it's hard to say.

76
00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.060
It's hard to say the greatest,
cause there was a few of those guys.

77
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.710
He was one of them.
How old is he now?

78
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.490
He's probably in his late thirties something like that.
Yeah,
that sounds right.

79
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.810
What is he doing?
I always know what that,

80
00:04:24.811 --> 00:04:28.500
I want to know what they do when they quit all that shit.
Just,
just breathe.

81
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.351
Just chilling,

82
00:04:29.351 --> 00:04:32.040
trying to figure out how to deal with all the radiation they'd been absorbing.

83
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.100
He's working at FRY's.
Sit in front of that computer screen is,

84
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.310
hi Joe.
All your cells are mutated.
Well,
some of them now,
I think,

85
00:04:41.311 --> 00:04:44.750
I think some of them are smart enough now that they realize the,
uh,

86
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.460
how quick the rises and how quick the fall might be.

87
00:04:47.461 --> 00:04:50.490
That they're just sort of banking money and just riding it out to see how long

88
00:04:50.491 --> 00:04:52.350
that goes.
Yeah.
But it's kind of like,
okay.

89
00:04:52.351 --> 00:04:56.400
Kind of like how in golf you only get paid paid if you win.
Yeah.

90
00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.370
Not a lot of these guys can bank all that money.
Right?

91
00:04:59.371 --> 00:05:01.110
They still gotta have something to do after it's done.

92
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.450
It's the best of the best bank.

93
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.290
But the high majority of guys are just making a living.
I just said,

94
00:05:06.291 --> 00:05:08.970
and this the way,
it's different though.
They don't have to pay a coach.

95
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.500
They don't,
they're just at home in their part.

96
00:05:10.501 --> 00:05:12.290
In some cases their parent's house still.

97
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.570
Most cases I might just by their parents to new house.
That might be their goal.

98
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.210
They buy their parents house and kick them the fuck out.
Yeah.
That's happened.

99
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.820
Yeah.
By their parent's house.
The,
yeah.
You remember when you were out?

100
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.090
Like playing video games,
Mike,

101
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.890
get the fuck out and take care and with you pack our shit off to

102
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.330
Ryan's kicking us out.
Yeah.
Get the fuck out.
Uh,

103
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.930
you should have been so mean to him.
Yeah,
no,
the mom's bitching at him.

104
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.200
I didn't fucking know he could bought us this nice Tom.
Well,

105
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.600
toughen them up is why he became such a good player twice a fucking man.

106
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.790
When they're fucking assholes,
they take credit for it.

107
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.390
Toughened you up and that's why you liked this.
Yup.
