Now when you think about a guy like Deontay wilder who's got this wild style and

2
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.070
tries to knock you out with every,
with every punch,

3
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.800
are you doing anything different without giving away your strategy coming into

4
00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:14.251
this fight?

5
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:18.660
Are you doing anything different in terms of your preparation or in terms of the

6
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:21.480
way you shadow box or move or train?

7
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.570
<v 1>Not really,
no.
Um,</v>

8
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.820
how can I explain this without sounding like a clown

9
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.520
or trying your best?
Don't tie Wilda as a one trick pony.

10
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.460
I don't need to do anything special to beat him.
I just need to vent me.

11
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.350
Self jump tie wild is looking for one right hand all night.

12
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.750
It's a good trick though.
I said gold trick,

13
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.010
but we all know what happens when not trick.
Don't lumped.
Yeah,

14
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.860
you've lost [inaudible] you need mall.
The one punch to beat me.

15
00:00:53.861 --> 00:00:56.200
You need to be able to set it up with footwork,
spade,

16
00:00:56.201 --> 00:00:57.790
faints movement and he doesn't have any of that.

17
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.350
If the Great Klitschko I'd excellent footwork and ability to set that big punch

18
00:01:02.351 --> 00:01:05.770
up.
Couldn't do it.
What chance as the big swing,
a golf day when it,

19
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.310
if I get hit by a swinging right,
Tom does a survey of knocking out,

20
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.890
it's my fault.
I want it to knock me out.

21
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.300
If I let wild swing one of those wild punches from the back of the hall and hit

22
00:01:16.301 --> 00:01:18.940
me and knocked me out,
then I'll say thank you very much.

23
00:01:18.941 --> 00:01:20.110
You put me out of my misery.

24
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.560
God bless you wilder because obviously I can't be a great fight and I think I

25
00:01:26.251 --> 00:01:29.890
am.
If I'm getting knocked out by swinging punches,
it's just not possible.

26
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.870
I don't take big shots anymore.

27
00:01:31.871 --> 00:01:36.871
Years ago from before pre 2013 I used to take everything buying in the face.

28
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.610
We'll try and walk through and use my share strength,

29
00:01:40.611 --> 00:01:44.380
size and aggression at heart and determination to get through every event.

30
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.100
But as I stepped up in levels and realized that wasn't going to get me anywhere

31
00:01:48.101 --> 00:01:50.230
but a good idea and a good punching in the face.

32
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.760
So I changed the style to box in and move in,
slipping and sliding.

33
00:01:54.761 --> 00:01:58.490
And people have never seen me take any big shots because I'll just ride him.

34
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.140
Bill and Mohammed Ali used to do is take the shots on the gloves,
go with it.

35
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.010
Slim slide roll.
Even as powerful as George form on walls.

36
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.850
He was the heavy favorite go and he knocked out Frazier and Frazier beat early

37
00:02:09.851 --> 00:02:11.920
and he had great fights over 15 rounds.

38
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.960
It didn't help him in that fight because he used his greatest asset against him.

39
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.370
And if I can use Deontay wilds own power against him,
then I've worn.

40
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.000
He's looking for one punch.
I am not.
So there we go.

41
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.780
I don't believe if he can't learn upon,
she's lost every round.

42
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.710
Even he's a promoter.
Lou Dibella said recently,
he said,

43
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.220
if he doesn't knock Tyson down or knock him out,
I don't see how we can win.
