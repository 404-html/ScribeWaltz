WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.500
How weird is this a whole association to you?
Cause it's weird to me.

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.540
The IDW.
Yeah.
Oh,
IDW.
Just that of course.
Intellectual,

3
00:00:09.541 --> 00:00:12.870
dark web.
Hell it is.
It's like I've been trying to puzzle it out.

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.740
I mean I think what it is is a loose collection of early adopters of a

5
00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:19.740
revolutionary technology.
That's what it looks like to me.

6
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.290
And it we found each other because we're all doing the same thing,

7
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.930
but it's also a bunch of people that are honest,

8
00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:29.670
intellectually honest about their and maybe don't even district don't even agree

9
00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:32.240
on full.
Yeah,
we'll definitely but honest about perception.

10
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.890
Well and also I think interested in long form discussion,
right.
And,

11
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.630
and able to engage in it because otherwise we wouldn't be having the relative

12
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:42.810
success that we're having in the,
in the,
in the middle.
You,
you know,

13
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:46.260
and it got a name and that's kind of interesting.
And that's Eric though.
Yeah,

14
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:49.020
that's right.
That's Eric.
He loves it.
Oh yeah.

15
00:00:49.021 --> 00:00:53.420
He certainly loves and he's playing with fire versus spas.
Definitely.
Definitely.

16
00:00:53.421 --> 00:00:57.090
Yeah.
He denies it.
He loves it.
Which is what's most interesting about it.

17
00:00:57.091 --> 00:00:58.340
I love to rib him.
Yeah.

18
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.340
When it's got this funny conspiratorial element there that's sort of true in

19
00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:04.050
sort of mostly dramatic.

20
00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:07.740
And as a mathematician he's always looking for patterns and codes.

21
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.180
I don't know what to make of it.
I mean things get a name and then you think,

22
00:01:12.181 --> 00:01:15.120
well why did that get named?
And well someone named it.
But yeah,

23
00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:18.840
but the name stuck.
So it seemed apropos to some degree.
And well,

24
00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:21.660
what do we have in common?
Most of us are entrepreneurial.

25
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.230
Most of us have our own platform,
so we can speak independently.

26
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.550
Most of us are interested in long form philosophical discussions.

27
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.540
Primarily not political but,
but bordering on political,
well g bands,

28
00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:35.470
more political office.
He's the most,
yeah.

29
00:01:35.471 --> 00:01:38.250
But he's also very sophisticated political commentator.

30
00:01:38.251 --> 00:01:42.410
So he borders on both the philosophical and the religious.
Right.
So,
um,

31
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.160
and then we're,
we're,

32
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.120
we're all the newly new adopters of this new technology.

33
00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:50.370
And so that's enough to put us in a group.
And then,
well,

34
00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:52.320
it turns out that we've all been talking to each other.

35
00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:55.440
But part of the reason for that is while we're all doing the same thing on the

36
00:01:55.441 --> 00:01:57.810
net,
so it's not surprising that we're talking to each other.

37
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.010
So I always go for the simple explanations first.
You know,
it's not a movement,

38
00:02:02.011 --> 00:02:06.930
exactly what it is.
It's the manifestation of a new technology.
And then,
well,

39
00:02:06.931 --> 00:02:10.500
do we have anything in common that's worth discussing that would make this a

40
00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:14.790
viable group,
let's say?
And the answer to that is,
I dunno,

41
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.610
you know,
I've been touring with Ruben,
that's been good.

42
00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:20.750
It's been good to have a comedian along and he's also a good interviewer.

43
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.990
He does the Q and A's with me and it's nice to have some levity in the mix

44
00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:26.350
because the conversations are,

45
00:02:26.351 --> 00:02:28.410
the discussions with the audience are very serious.

46
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.610
Although I can crack a joke and uh,
I can't tell a joke,

47
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.080
but if something funny occurs to be,
I can say it and sometimes it's funny.

48
00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:40.620
So that's something,
um,
you know,
and we've been,

49
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.490
we've been discussing a fair bit and I had good conversations with Shapiro and

50
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:47.970
Harris for that matter.
So there is lots of interplay between us,

51
00:02:47.971 --> 00:02:49.950
but I think that's more because we,

52
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.130
we inhabit the same technological space more than the same in theological space,

53
00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.260
apart from the fact that we are actually interested in dialogue fundamentally.

54
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.120
So we'll see.
I mean,
I'm,

55
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.700
I'm watching it with curiosity.

56
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.100
<v 1>Are you apprehensive?
Do you think that there's any potential downside?</v>

57
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.640
<v 0>So there's lots of downsides to it.
Sure.
There's lots of downsides.
I mean,</v>

58
00:03:13.641 --> 00:03:15.470
first of all,
you know,

59
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.060
most of us are on an individual individualistic path.
I'm not gonna,

60
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.650
I'm not really much of a group guy,
you know,
so am I in this group?
It's like,

61
00:03:24.651 --> 00:03:28.990
well,
I'm pleased to be associated with you guys,
that's for sure.
Um,

62
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.970
but I don't really know what it would mean or if it should mean anything or if

63
00:03:31.971 --> 00:03:34.850
it'll screw up what I'm doing or if it's,
I don't know anything about it.

64
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.850
But mostly I'm curious.
It's like,
Huh,
this is a group.

65
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:41.260
I thought this is the rat pack.

66
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:44.000
I thought when I walked into the restaurant of us,
cause we were out last night,

67
00:03:44.001 --> 00:03:48.820
it was Ben Shapiro,
Sam Harris,
Eric Weinstein,
Dave Rubin,

68
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:53.440
Joe Rogan in me,
right?
And my wife Tammy.
And so we're all walking in there.

69
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:53.921
And I thought,
well,

70
00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:57.010
this is kind of like being in the rat pack in the 1950s I thought,
well,
I know,

71
00:03:57.011 --> 00:04:00.310
maybe it isn't,
but that's what came to mind.
So I thought that's funny.
And it's,

72
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:04.330
it's,
it's kind of cool and it's interesting and it's edgy and all of that.

73
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.640
But I'm not,
I'm not taking it seriously.
I'm not,
I'm not also not,

74
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.980
you know,
I'm not taking it.
Not seriously either,

75
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.730
but I'm just watching and I'm watching everybody interact because it is a very

76
00:04:15.731 --> 00:04:20.200
motley crew of people.
It is.
So,
and they're very different.
And so,

77
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.970
but it was very much think,
well,
you,
okay.
So why did you think it was enjoyable?

78
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.470
<v 1>It's good conversation.
I mean,</v>

79
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.140
everyone that was in that group has been on my podcast or I've been on theirs.

80
00:04:31.141 --> 00:04:35.430
And you know,
it's a fun group of really honest,

81
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.050
interesting people.
The Cuellar very peculiar people.
Especially Eric.
Yeah,

82
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.830
he's listening right now.
It's on fucking with them.
I love that guy.

83
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.920
But I mean they're all,
they're all,

84
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.470
everyone's different but everyone's also unique and they all bring a lot to the

85
00:04:49.471 --> 00:04:54.230
table and that's what's interesting about it.
The weird collection.
Yeah.

86
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.860
You know I'm,
I don't know what to think of it.

87
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.040
Like when Eric called me up about the whole New York Times thing,
I'm like,

88
00:04:59.041 --> 00:05:02.580
what are you talking about?
Like we're all doing this and you did that.
Hey,

89
00:05:02.581 --> 00:05:04.470
why did you do that?
What I do what?

90
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.110
What did you be part of the New York Times Article?
A barely.

91
00:05:07.111 --> 00:05:11.100
Was I just a the answered a couple of questions cause they took a picture of
you.

92
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.140
You got to picture.
Yeah,
they asked me to take a picture.
They didn't upset.

93
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.470
They should have taken a picture of me.

94
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.780
I was dressed like I was going on stage at the comedy store.

95
00:05:18.781 --> 00:05:20.320
It didn't wear anything and he definitely,

96
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.710
they were trying to make a big deal of it.
I'm like,
look,
I don't have any time.

97
00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.980
This is,
you want to take a picture of me?
This is what I'm wearing.
Yeah.

98
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.120
And we did it on the parking lot above the comedy store and it started to rain.

99
00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:34.260
I go,
we're done.
I gotta go,
I gotta go on stage.
I can't be soaking wet,
you know,

100
00:05:34.261 --> 00:05:37.170
and,
and then go on stage.
And that was it.
You know,
it was just,

101
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.870
<v 0>okay.
So your take on it is that it's,
well,
it's intra.
Your take on it is,</v>

102
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.690
it's interesting.
Yes.
Well,
this is the,

103
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.770
this is probably another thing that unites that group of people.

104
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.470
Everyone in that group of people is likely to get in trouble because they find

105
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.750
too many things.
Interesting.
Right.
And it's trade openness.

106
00:05:54.751 --> 00:05:58.520
That's another thing that unites all of us.
And so,
and you know,

107
00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:02.480
curiosity killed the cat and so good,
but we're not cats.

108
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.050
True curiosity also built the pyramids.
It did.
It did.
It did.

109
00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:07.550
And it saved a lot of caps too.

110
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.830
Let's end it with that.
All right.
All right,
Jordan.
Always a pleasure.

111
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:13.460
My friend Joe.
