1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.070
You reminded me.
Well,
no,
it's not even Trump.
It's like he,

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.450
like Kim Kardashian goes to,
you know,
get Alice Marie Johnson,

3
00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:07.860
like she's been fighting for this for years.

4
00:00:07.861 --> 00:00:10.950
She put all of her money into a legal team to do this.
Like,

5
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.800
and that's not the only case she's been working on like actually trying to help

6
00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:17.010
these people get clemency.
And she takes a picture and he's like,

7
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.650
he says something just very Ben Shapiro.
He was like,

8
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.960
we should not be worshiping slot buck metal.
He's worshiping us.

9
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.260
We're taking a meeting with communities,
not worshiping a celebrity.
These are,

10
00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:30.150
that's a little extreme of an analysis for a meeting.
And the picture is taken.

11
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:31.320
Like,
you know,
I visited the present,

12
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.080
there's a full time photographer and every person that meets to the president,

13
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.160
you've got a picture in the Oval Office.
It's like a part of the system.
Um,

14
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.400
and yeah,
so I was just like,
dude,
shut up.
Like,
you know,

15
00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:46.160
like I didn't say shut up.
I said like essentially got a good point.
In a way.

16
00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:49.460
We really shouldn't be worshiping celebrity for the sake of celebrity.

17
00:00:49.461 --> 00:00:53.750
And especially reality show celebrity and it doesn't mean that she couldn't have

18
00:00:53.751 --> 00:00:57.300
a very valid point about prison reform.
That's what I'm saying.

19
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.630
That's what I'm saying.
She wasn't like he,

20
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.130
I think he said something like we shouldn't allow celebrities to shape policy.

21
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.930
She wouldn't go there shape policy.

22
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:06.690
She literally had a case as she's been trying to get pardoned.

23
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.900
The only person that can do that happens to be President Donald Trump.

24
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.360
It's actually,
you know,
what she's trying to do is actually very honorable.

25
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.380
That's what I said.
I said,
listen.
Yeah,
she,
and she's been working on it for you.

26
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.830
Like she's actually into this now.

27
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.560
Like she's into this like prison reform and I'm passionate about it.

28
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.320
Like I grew up seeing my uncle's in prison.
So like for me,

29
00:01:23.321 --> 00:01:25.660
the only time that I like snapped back at anyone is if it's something that I

30
00:01:25.661 --> 00:01:28.330
care about.
Obviously.
Like I really am passionate about black America.

31
00:01:28.331 --> 00:01:31.390
I'm really passionate about the changes that can happen for black America and

32
00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:33.160
prison reform or something I'm really passionate about.

33
00:01:33.161 --> 00:01:36.550
So I've been observing like how hard Jared Kushner's and working on this,

34
00:01:36.551 --> 00:01:39.790
how hard Ivanka has been working on this and have really understood what they're

35
00:01:39.791 --> 00:01:42.880
trying to do.
Like you know,
I went to the prison reform summit,

36
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.000
a cup like you know,
a month ago and and Kim in this,

37
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.340
she doesn't even like agree with Trump and a lot of stuff.

38
00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:51.530
She's thrown some shade at him.
But this is something that's awesome.

39
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.680
Ray Johnson case she was doing before Trump got into office.
Yes.

40
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.190
I love about the picture of her and him.

41
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.230
What she's like where the fuck over here?
Yeah,

42
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.660
I was taking a picture with Donald.
I'd be hugging.
Yeah.

43
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.130
But she,
she cares about just the case.
But look how far away she is from him.

44
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.233
I will say,

45
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.450
I will say it is awkward though because his desk is a lot lower than you than

46
00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:20.451
you realize you have to like stand up straight like she's standing or like Ben,

47
00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:24.720
like I bent when I was in there,
which is also kind of weird too.

48
00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:27.480
So it's like you see people who either like this or they're like this and

49
00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:32.000
there's no in between.
We could do like 1950s moviestar picture like this.
Yeah,

50
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.650
exactly.
I should.
That's what I should've done.
But yeah,

51
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.670
she's closer than I thought she was.
I felt like maybe I put it in my own head,

52
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.370
which actually a pretty God damn good right there.
She's gorgeous,

53
00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:45.910
but it doesn't look anything like she used to look,
but whoever did that,

54
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.350
nobody does nowadays to surgeon.
You did some fun,
awesome work.

55
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.350
She's plump.
It looks good.

56
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.430
I guess the question is the kind of celebrity do a good act,
you know and sure,

57
00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.640
of course the answer is yes.
I mean that's,

58
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.920
that's what Chelsea handler's trying to do.
I mean that's like she's donated,

59
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.670
but she really is.
She donated $1 million to a Puerto Rico.

60
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.850
Oh yeah.
That's good.
That should be celebrated.

61
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:11.590
That's what she's trying to do with all of her money now.

62
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:14.860
She doesn't even give a fuck about like,
which is show business anymore.

63
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.990
All of that stuff.
Like when they do stuff like that,

64
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:18.010
it's great and it's honorable,

65
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:20.560
but like the stuff that I hate that celebrities do and what,

66
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.880
which I differentiate from,

67
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:26.800
and I guess this confuses people is when they just give their opinion like we,

68
00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:27.340
you know,

69
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.490
at like at the Emmy's and they're onstage just like teaching all of us about how

70
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:34.040
wrong our opinions are.
It's like I don't need the celebrity grand standing.

71
00:03:34.041 --> 00:03:34.874
Like you know,

72
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.540
if there's an issue you care about other than the fact that people disagree with

73
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:39.040
you,
then sure do that.

74
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.500
If you care about like Ashton Kutcher going after sex trafficking,

75
00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:42.790
celebrate that.
That's cool.

76
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.840
Like Kim Kardashian going over after a crime justice reform.
Celebrate that.

77
00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:47.674
That's cool.

78
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.860
But when you get these celebrities that just get up there and try to deliver a

79
00:03:50.861 --> 00:03:55.460
teenager,
it's like shut up.
Literally nobody cares what you think.
Like this.
Whoa.

80
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.301
They care enough to,

81
00:03:56.301 --> 00:04:00.520
that person's got that platform and they feel like this is their opportunity to

82
00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:05.521
say something significant and like also like thanking God or for sure a hundred

83
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.540
percent virtue signaling,
letting everybody know how moral and ethical they are,

84
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.370
even if they are,
I mean,
this is,

85
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.300
it's just those fucking award shows or weirdest shit.
