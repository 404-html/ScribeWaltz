1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:00.690
What,

2
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.650
what was it that when you first got brought into a mental hospital,

3
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.690
what was it about?
Well,

4
00:00:07.691 --> 00:00:11.110
I had got hit by a car and the,
uh,

5
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.590
the hood ornament went in my head in my brains and scramble them and I,

6
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.720
I used to be an a plus math student.
I was just great in geometry.

7
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.540
Oh my God.
I loved geometry.

8
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.260
I got straight A's and then,
you know,

9
00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:34.150
I sort of fell apart after that.
Took a long time to heal from it.
And um,

10
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.050
you know,
uh,
how much did your personality change?
Oh,

11
00:00:38.051 --> 00:00:40.150
it changed drastically.
But you know,

12
00:00:40.151 --> 00:00:45.040
you read all that stuff about a traumatic head injuries now cause I do read a

13
00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:48.580
lot and talk to a lot of football players who have the same thing and we do

14
00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:52.810
discuss it.
Yeah,
you changed right away.
Yeah.
It's still you,

15
00:00:52.811 --> 00:00:53.770
but it's like a,

16
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.420
it's kind of like an Artel artificial intelligence.
You Do,

17
00:00:58.421 --> 00:01:02.050
you find that,
did you find that you became much more impulsive?

18
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.700
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Well,

19
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.530
yeah.
Here's what happened.
I was crossing the street on my way to school.

20
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.350
How old were you?
Have a 16.
No,

21
00:01:17.351 --> 00:01:18.184
it's 15.

22
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.450
Go on the first week of high school.

23
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.710
And,
uh,
how's a big nerd?

24
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.570
And Anyway,
uh,

25
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.660
was crossing the street and then it was a top of the hill.
And this woman girl,

26
00:01:38.661 --> 00:01:43.661
she was on her way of the university and the sun blinded her and she ran me

27
00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:46.590
over.
And,
uh,

28
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.340
the rest is history.

29
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.290
How long were you in the hospital for?
Mm,
so first you must,

30
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.890
you must have been in a medical hospital first,

31
00:01:57.891 --> 00:02:01.520
and then you were miss admitted to a mental hospital after was about three

32
00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:06.290
months in between.
Right.
Uh,
but I was in the hospital for a while,
you know,

33
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:07.560
and,
uh,

34
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.560
I had a head concussion and a brain concussion and I had hamburger meat for

35
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.050
legs.
So they did all these,
um,
what do they call them?

36
00:02:18.051 --> 00:02:23.030
Skin grafts on my legs.
Uh,
and,
um,

37
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.750
yeah,
I was in there for a while,

38
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.710
then I came out of there and I had forgotten everything about math when I

39
00:02:31.711 --> 00:02:35.970
returned to school.
We're s matter of weeks after that,

40
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.020
maybe two months.
I'm really bad on time now,
but uh,

41
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.610
and uh,
I had forgotten all my math and it was just terrible.

42
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.090
That was a big depressive depression I went into because I couldn't remember.

43
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.920
I couldn't remember things,
you know?

44
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.210
And also I became way more impulsive then I was like,

45
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.070
I don't know what I did.
Then I started going really

46
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.900
<v 2>out there into the ethers.
I went way out there.</v>

47
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.970
Okay.
How so?
Why out?
You know how you go way out?
You have to go way out.
No,

48
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.480
I'm really,
I've had a lot of head injuries.
Oh yeah.

49
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.830
I've been at but not terrible.
Mostly just punches and kicks.

50
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.170
Nothin like car accidents or never played football.
Yeah.

51
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.180
But my head injuries of,
you know,

52
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:29.110
there were just more a cumulative when I was young till I was about 21,

53
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:32.470
22 where I stopped,
stop fighting,
stop sparring.

54
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.680
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

55
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.880
<v 2>But nothing but a,</v>

56
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.530
definitely I'm subject to impulsive behavior still.
Yeah.

57
00:03:40.531 --> 00:03:43.770
But I can't keep it under wraps.
I keep it under control because I'm aware of it.

58
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.080
But when I was younger,
I didn't understand what was going on.

59
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.100
I would just be subject to whims,
very addictive behavior,

60
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.490
but I've tried to keep it positive,
but it would be addicted to things,

61
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.450
addicted to doing things,
addicted to games,

62
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.850
addicted like ridiculously addictive.

63
00:03:59.851 --> 00:04:04.010
I spend 10 1214 hours a day playing video games.
That kind of shit.

64
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.880
My Kid.
Yeah,
well some of it's just normal because video games are awesome.

65
00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:12.000
But yeah,
it would be for me to be everything,
martial arts,
pool,

66
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.630
whatever do is I'll just be completely obsessed with it and to be thinking about

67
00:04:15.631 --> 00:04:20.130
it all day in port where it wasn't necessarily healthy and just on a whim I

68
00:04:20.131 --> 00:04:21.680
would just want to go do something.
I just,

69
00:04:21.681 --> 00:04:25.560
I almost had no control over compulsion's you know?

70
00:04:25.561 --> 00:04:30.561
And I think some of that is whatever brain injuries that I've had are very mild

71
00:04:30.751 --> 00:04:32.610
in comparison to a lot of people that I know,

72
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.430
certainly very mild in comparison to yours.

73
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.140
And now is a lot of trauma in the state hospital that,
you know,

74
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.750
I'm like,
you know,

75
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.230
being there and seeing and experiencing.

76
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.560
And how long did that for nine months.

77
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.600
So what was it that they brought you in there for?
What was,

78
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.780
how were you behaving that they decided that you needed to be admitted?

79
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.810
I was out there.
You say that,
like what does that mean?

80
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.983
<v 1>MMM.</v>

81
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.500
<v 2>I don't think there's any words.
The English you just can't understand.</v>

82
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.070
Didn't have a control of reality.
You didn't have control of your behavior.

83
00:05:16.071 --> 00:05:19.130
Your thinking was screwed up.
I was,
you know,

84
00:05:19.131 --> 00:05:23.210
not thinking like the normal thing that they say you should be thinking about

85
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.110
and,
but people round you had realized it,
that it was,

86
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.910
it was so bad that they had to admit you to a hospital wasn't just a over

87
00:05:30.911 --> 00:05:35.450
Rosanne.
She's eccentric.
It was,
she needs actual medical help.

88
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.010
Yeah.
I asked to be admitted.
Do you knew something was really wrong?
Yeah.

89
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.870
Hi Sean.
They admitted it was,

90
00:05:41.871 --> 00:05:46.190
did you know at the time where you completely aware that it was connected to

91
00:05:46.191 --> 00:05:49.610
your car accident?
Uh,
no.

92
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.830
You just knew something was wrong.
Yeah.

93
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.480
And back then they didn't really kind of understand that the way they understand

94
00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:58.070
it now.
No,
they

95
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:03.070
<v 0>didn't understand too much about bipolar disorder or they knew nothing about,</v>

96
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.230
um,
multiple personality disorder.
Trauma related trauma related.
Yeah.

97
00:06:08.231 --> 00:06:09.051
PTSD.

98
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:13.460
Now they call everything pts and they don't even say d anymore.

99
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.230
They say pts
post traumatic stress.

100
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.100
So when they admitted you,
what was the treatment like?

101
00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:24.620
What did they do to you when you were inside the mental hospital?

102
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.070
Well,
they right away put me on an antipsychotic.
What was it?

103
00:06:31.071 --> 00:06:35.510
Do you remember Mallory Rail and what did that do?
I don't know.

104
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.120
I wasn't there.
I was gone.

105
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.810
I was just watching these people.
I was in the mental institution with,

106
00:06:44.811 --> 00:06:48.380
and I wanted to tell that story because there was this one lady,

107
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.890
I think I told this to Paul Reubens too.

108
00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:54.140
I think it might be where he got large Marge.

109
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.980
But there's this one lady and she's in this cage,
you know,

110
00:06:57.981 --> 00:07:02.120
she's in a cage with keys on our ward there.
And uh,

111
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.040
uh,
Christ,
I can't remember her name either.
Marge,

112
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.810
her name was march.
Yeah.
And she's about 600,
700 pounds.

113
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.970
And she's funnier than hell.
You know,
I thought,
man,
this,

114
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.460
this chick's got smooth lines,
you know,

115
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.870
and I traded lines with her and she'd laugh.
You know,
you,
you know,

116
00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:27.410
I was like jokes,
you can always find a joke wherever you are,
you know,

117
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.580
that's the key to life I think.
But,
um,

118
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.333
<v 1>okay,</v>

119
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.740
<v 0>so sh oh,
everybody called me chunky.
That was my name,</v>

120
00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:43.410
chunky.
And uh,

121
00:07:43.411 --> 00:07:45.420
there was another girl in their name,
shorty,

122
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.660
so it was chunky and shorty we were like a duo.

123
00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:53.040
But anyway,
um,
so she's like,
hey,
Roseanne,

124
00:07:53.041 --> 00:07:58.041
get what's her name's keys when they go to dinner and open this up here,

125
00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.700
you know,
come in here.
I'm like,
okay.
You know,
cause,
you know,

126
00:08:02.701 --> 00:08:07.470
after all I was crazy too.
And uh,
and I trust,
I don't know,

127
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.700
I just always,

128
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.600
I never questioned that there was danger anywhere.

129
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:17.160
I always got in trouble,
you know,
caught,
beat up something,
you know.

130
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.720
But,
uh,
so I did it,
you know,

131
00:08:21.721 --> 00:08:24.570
and I can't all Onca that was her name,
the head nurse.

132
00:08:24.571 --> 00:08:29.100
I hated her because she told me I needed a base.
I'll tell that story later.

133
00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:33.990
It was horrifying.
It changed my life.
But anyway,
so they all go to dinner.

134
00:08:33.991 --> 00:08:37.530
So I go in there,
steal the case out of the thing where they are,

135
00:08:37.531 --> 00:08:40.980
you know the attendance and I go in there with Marge and

136
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.910
leave the keys in the door and close the door.

137
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:49.243
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

138
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.560
<v 0>So I'm like,
hey Margie or doe,
how's it going?
Margin.</v>

139
00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:00.630
And she's like Chunky.
You know why they put me in this cage?

140
00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:04.380
Don't you
take some drag of a cigarette?

141
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:10.950
I go,
well,
why?
No,
I don't know why.

142
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.860
Well chunky

143
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.540
because they consider me to be dangerous.

144
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:26.870
I'm Mike,
how calm
I am.

145
00:09:26.871 --> 00:09:29.180
I'm like Gomer Pyle,
right?
Seriously.

146
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.380
And I'm total gold and you're like 16 at the time.
15

147
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:40.050
about eight minutes into it I realized,
Oh shit.

148
00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.930
Oh Shit,
something's going on here.

149
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:49.790
That's how long it always took me to like zero in on what's happening.

150
00:09:49.791 --> 00:09:53.600
Cause I'm not even there.
You know?
I'm always ignoring when other people talk.

151
00:09:53.601 --> 00:09:58.400
I don't listen.
I'm thinking of funny things that they bore me,
you know?
Yeah.

152
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:03.120
So I'm always in my own head.
I never get out really except for when I work.

153
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:08.730
But,
uh,
so,
uh,
then it got,
then it took a turn in or she's like,

154
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:11.810
so it got to a,

155
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.320
why do they consider you dangerous?
You know,

156
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:20.610
I had to ask it cause she kept on getting me there to that point where she

157
00:10:20.611 --> 00:10:24.080
wanted me to ask it.
I was trying to delay it and you know,

158
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:27.840
cause I knew they'd be back in 40 minutes and it was like going on 20 now

159
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:33.760
she goes,
I'm in here because that's my voice I got to do with Margaret.

160
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.490
I'm in here because

161
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.530
I broke a couple of tenants bags and they tell you that.

162
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:46.780
No,
my ha,

163
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:50.460
how'd you do that?
And in my head I'm thinking,

164
00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:55.500
don't change.
Don't miss a beat.
Don't miss a breath.
Don't look nowhere,

165
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.850
just to keep on Ecmo.
You know,
Utah,
your dog girl.

166
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:04.530
Cause she knew she was dangerous.
Well that's when it hit my head that it was,
oh,

167
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:09.300
she's talking about,
you know,
I'm uh,
I'm feeling like pray.
Right.

168
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:14.380
You know,
and uh,
I go,

169
00:11:14.381 --> 00:11:17.710
how'd you do that?
Cause I'd figured,
Oh,
it's an accident.
You know,
it's good.

170
00:11:17.711 --> 00:11:22.380
All Marge,
she sales,
good job.
She goes,
well,

171
00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:25.620
it's easy.
You just know I'm doing me again.
I got to do her.
It's easy.

172
00:11:25.621 --> 00:11:28.570
You just put one hand here and one hand here and then you're

173
00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.440
like,
oh,
ah

174
00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:36.363
<v 1>hmm.</v>

175
00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.720
<v 0>Where'd you learn that?
I don't.
I'm changing the subject and a hundred.</v>

176
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:44.430
How was your mom?
What was the school like?
You went to,
what's your favorite book?

177
00:11:44.431 --> 00:11:46.710
What's your favorite color?
What kind of ice cream you like?

178
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:51.210
You ever seen that there's worms in the oatmeal?
You ever noticed that

179
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.870
she started?
Got that one.
Got Her.
She's like,
yeah,
I did.

180
00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:01.410
I did notice I would crawl and motherfuckers I go,
yeah,

181
00:12:01.411 --> 00:12:04.870
next week does to eat that,
this shoe,
this one.
You know,
I,

182
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.960
I like suddenly I'm transported to a confederacy of dunces when he's on the

183
00:12:10.421 --> 00:12:14.770
thing against Levi pants.
Remember that rant in that book?

184
00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:19.020
So I'm just tap dancing really.
And uh,

185
00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:27.140
then I hear it click,
man.
I grabbed,
I got up,

186
00:12:27.141 --> 00:12:31.510
fumbled the keys out of the door,
put them back in the,
uh,
attendance room.
What?

187
00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:35.950
My Room
when you said you hear it click.
Yeah,

188
00:12:35.951 --> 00:12:37.570
I knew the first door got opened.

189
00:12:37.571 --> 00:12:41.250
There was two doors that I heard the first door open.
They're coming back from,

190
00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:46.210
from dinner.
So you got away from us,
be sick,
you know,
in my room.

191
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.080
Right.
That's why I didn't go to dinner.
Yeah.

192
00:12:50.081 --> 00:12:52.540
So I'm just laying there and that was like daily.

193
00:12:52.541 --> 00:12:56.650
I mean there were so many weird people in there.
We had this one girl,
Rosie,

194
00:12:56.651 --> 00:12:58.330
her name was where she'd always grabbed.

195
00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.620
She always ended up with a pair of real sharp scissors and lunch for someone's

196
00:13:02.621 --> 00:13:07.600
throat.
We're like,
where'd you get them?
Who's bringing her them scissors,

197
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.030
you know?
But anyway,
I went on antipsychotic medicine and um,

198
00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.260
that was good that I was on there for the Shit I saw.
Now when you say anything,

199
00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.940
my friends hanging and stuff like that.
I'm sorry.

200
00:13:18.941 --> 00:13:21.600
Friends hanging out in the mental institution.
Yeah.

201
00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:27.490
So I saw worse than that.
What'd you say?
Hi.
I saw,

202
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:32.920
you know,
victims of abuse was terrible by the guards.

203
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:35.180
Know if kids come in,
you know,

204
00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:39.490
victims of abuse families that came in that were mentally scarred by it.
Yeah,

205
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.580
yeah,
yeah.
Now when they put you on anti psychotics,

206
00:13:42.581 --> 00:13:45.770
was it because you were exhibiting psychotic behavior?
What,
what,

207
00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:50.320
what kind of psychotic behavior?
While they thought it was psychotic,

208
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.790
I was just scared that they are.

209
00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.840
I think I was throwing them off cause I want him to think I was psychotic.

210
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.780
I didn't want to think them to think I was schizophrenia.

211
00:13:58.781 --> 00:14:03.210
I knew enough not to let them near me.
They,
if,
cause once you got the,
uh,

212
00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.950
once you got the diagnosis of schizophrenia,

213
00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:10.120
they would no shocks and they'd experiment on your,

214
00:14:10.121 --> 00:14:14.420
basically you're in Guinea pig and I didn't want that.
So maybe I,

215
00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.080
you know,
and then,
you know,
so yeah,

216
00:14:17.081 --> 00:14:21.850
I was doing weird things like walking down the middle of streets after I buy the

217
00:14:21.851 --> 00:14:24.850
car,
I walked down the middle of streets.
I don't know,
I thought,

218
00:14:24.851 --> 00:14:27.280
oh you got to get over your fear of crossing the streets.

219
00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:31.270
That's what was in my head.
And then I'd walk down the highway,
you know,

220
00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.320
I was in a whole other realm.

221
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:39.100
It was like a real surrealistic and metaphysical realm.

222
00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:44.200
And I grew comfortable there.
But you know,
I think most artists,
writers,

223
00:14:44.201 --> 00:14:49.120
and performers are in that world.
I mean,
we got a toe in it,
at least.
