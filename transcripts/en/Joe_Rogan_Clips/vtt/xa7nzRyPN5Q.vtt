Hello Freak bitches

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.300
<v 1>did Twitter.
But are you,
oh,
I love Twitter.
I love it.</v>

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.470
And I know that I'm a giant bitch on there and I don't do your I am you a bitch

4
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.000
always telling people to go fuck themselves.
Oh wait.
It's like,

5
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.510
because it's so enjoyable to me.
It's like playing a game and I,

6
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.660
you know,
the part of me is like,
I hate that part of myself,

7
00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:25.590
but I also really like it because I think I'm be coming.
It's to me it's not,

8
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.580
I'm not a brand.

9
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.180
There's no Julie Kedsey fighter who has to impress anybody anymore like it.

10
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.060
You know,
there's a,
granted I represent invicta to a certain extent,

11
00:00:33.061 --> 00:00:37.590
but I know I fully understand that Shannon could fire me if I say something just

12
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.120
outrageous and horrible.
She wouldn't,

13
00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:42.660
she's a wonderful person and I'm no longer at behind the scenes there.
I'm just,

14
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.380
I'm a commentator.
I'm not somebody making any decisions with the company.
Right.

15
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.220
But I don't know,
when it comes to Twitter,

16
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.380
<v 0>what do you do?
You get in flame wars with people,
some street shit too.</v>

17
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.860
<v 1>Kind of enjoy when people insult me.
And I go after.
Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.700
But I do feel my brain deteriorating a little bit when they do that.
You know,

19
00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:02.070
it was just like I'm an I.
I was just like,
okay,

20
00:01:02.071 --> 00:01:04.770
I need to stop me to put this down now.
But you know,
when they come at me,

21
00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:07.360
they're just like,
you're a Feminazi your those who I'm just looking at,
come on.

22
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.290
I know.
Feminazi I'm very outspoken,
being a feminist.
I'm very,
uh,
you know,

23
00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:13.470
and when I talk about socialism,

24
00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:16.040
when I talk about I hate Donald Trump and I talk about this,
you know,
yeah,

25
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.140
<v 0>I know,
but I would never label you in like,</v>

26
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.270
you're just a genuine person.

27
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.780
Like who happens to be a woman who believes what you believe.
Like you,

28
00:01:24.781 --> 00:01:28.570
you're not like sexist.
You're not like anti male or anytime

29
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.770
<v 1>men.
I love men,</v>

30
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.070
but the thing is I am pro woman to certain sent me when it comes to MMA,

31
00:01:39.471 --> 00:01:39.631
I'm,

32
00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:42.470
I'm more interested in what's going on with women in the sport then with men.

33
00:01:42.471 --> 00:01:46.760
That's just where I'm oriented.
That's,
that's my part of your job.
And,
um,
but,

34
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.130
well,
I don't know.
There's this association,
they'll,
first of all,

35
00:01:49.131 --> 00:01:52.700
the whole Feminazi label is just,
I mean that's the first thing.
Like I said,
yeah,

36
00:01:52.701 --> 00:01:53.870
I'm really proud to be a feminist.

37
00:01:53.871 --> 00:01:55.360
And then people are just know that means you hate men.

38
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.690
You think they're all rapists?
And I'm like,
no,
that discredits men so much.

39
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.960
Like why?
No.

40
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.881
<v 0>Well,
it's silly.</v>

41
00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:06.780
And that though the term feminist has been so cooptive by negative thoughts.

42
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.230
So many people have this negative connotation they attached to it of course.

43
00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:12.650
And Its movements that,
you know,
third wave [inaudible] this and you know,

44
00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:17.100
there's certain when whenever appeal fucking problem,
male feminists,

45
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.963
they've ruined it.

46
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.810
Those fucking twats men ruin everything they've read.

47
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:23.720
Even ruined feminine.

48
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:25.683
<v 1>That's funny.
I know,</v>

49
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.600
I know Jamie was on here and he was a friend of mine in some weird happened with

50
00:02:28.601 --> 00:02:30.910
that guy.
I don't know what's going on with his life right now.

51
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.040
But Jamie Kilstein.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Not Good.

52
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.380
I don't know what's going and I don't want to speculate on any of that.

53
00:02:35.381 --> 00:02:37.390
But we were really good friends for a while and you know,
they,

54
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.190
I know his like he was very disliked as a male feminist,

55
00:02:42.191 --> 00:02:42.990
quote unquote male thing.

56
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.740
<v 0>Well it's because everybody thought that he was when he just got accused of</v>

57
00:02:46.741 --> 00:02:50.430
being right and they're just Coonhounds that are taking that angle.

58
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.180
I I that is an interest.

59
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.330
<v 1>I honestly think sometimes people are just assholes who want sex.</v>

60
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.820
And I also think people are manipulative assholes who want sex.

61
00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:05.800
I don't see him as a manipulative person,
but again,
I might
probably not,

62
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:07.440
I didn't interact.
Yeah,

63
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.640
<v 0>I don't know either.
You know,
I don't,</v>

64
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.460
I think people are a bunch of different things depending on who they are,

65
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:13.330
what time of the day.

66
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.070
I think it'd be nice if the whole world was egalitarianism and if we all looked

67
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:20.320
at the people as just treating them,

68
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.110
who they are based on their character and their personality and not categorizing

69
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:27.400
them.
So specifically like,

70
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.460
oh you are a woman so you are less or you are a man and you are

71
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.900
<v 1>or,
or vice averse male feminist.
And it's like that's the problem.
I mean,</v>

72
00:03:33.901 --> 00:03:34.970
are you joking when you said

73
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.753
no?
I mean,
yeah,

74
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:41.500
<v 0>it's,</v>

75
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.490
the problem is there's a lot of people that virtue signal and a lot of people

76
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:49.000
that are posturing and a lot of people that are putting a label on themselves to

77
00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:52.660
try to make themselves seem like they're in a higher moral high ground than the

78
00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:55.440
rest of the folks around them,
and that's the motivation for doing it.

79
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.930
That becomes transparent and people get angry at that.
They recognize what it is.

80
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.530
So when someone like Jamie Kilstein slips up after all these years of virtual

81
00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:04.720
signaling,
they're like,
ah,
I knew it.

82
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.360
<v 1>Fuck,
here's that.
Does that really negate some of the good things that he's done?</v>

83
00:04:09.361 --> 00:04:12.030
If he's influenced some men?
I don't know the virtue.

84
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.630
I guess one of the good things,
I don't know if he's maybe said,
oh,
hey,

85
00:04:15.631 --> 00:04:19.060
a woman is actually a person.
It's absolutely fall.

86
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.770
The fuck doesn't think a woman has a personal Twitter timeline.

87
00:04:22.771 --> 00:04:24.450
Let me tell you something.
Those people cool.

88
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.990
<v 0>If there's a person out there that doesn't think that a woman's a person fucking</v>

89
00:04:27.991 --> 00:04:30.630
Jamie Kilstein is not going to change their opinion.
It's just going to,

90
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.830
he's just going to broadcast it and let everybody know that's how he thinks and

91
00:04:34.831 --> 00:04:37.830
he's going to get all this love and people are going to send him all these likes

92
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.250
and they're going to give them thumbs up and say nice things to him on Twitter

93
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.840
and that may or may not be a good thing.
It's more a good thing that a bad thing.

94
00:04:45.841 --> 00:04:46.674
It's not a bad thing,

95
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.550
but you're not going to change some asshole opinion saying something like that.

96
00:04:50.551 --> 00:04:52.530
I don't know that you are,
but I,
I don't know.

97
00:04:52.531 --> 00:04:56.070
Have you changed any assholes opinion with any gear things that if you've come

98
00:04:56.071 --> 00:04:58.860
out and said something,
have you,
do you think you've changed people's opinions?

99
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.780
I think opinions change if they value what you're saying,

100
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.470
if they believe that you're being truthful and if what you're saying is

101
00:05:07.471 --> 00:05:10.140
compelling enough for them to reconsider the way they look at things,

102
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.610
it is possible,

103
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.200
but it's not 100% and it's not the motivation behind doing things in the first

104
00:05:16.201 --> 00:05:19.170
place.
I'm not trying,
I don't ever try to change people's opinions,

105
00:05:19.171 --> 00:05:24.171
but I do try to express myself as cleanly and as accurately and as honestly as I

106
00:05:24.211 --> 00:05:27.870
can.
And I think that in my opinion,
in my experience,

107
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.540
when I've heard people like you talking about your life,

108
00:05:30.541 --> 00:05:32.610
like you just talking about your life in this podcast,

109
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.830
I take that in and I know it's pure and it will make me consider every little,

110
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.740
every thing that a person says,
every sentence,

111
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.550
every conversation that you have with someone where they're being real with you,

112
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.760
it adds more knowledge to your database of human interaction and the way people

113
00:05:49.831 --> 00:05:51.900
behave and think.
Now thinking that way,

114
00:05:51.901 --> 00:05:55.710
it does slowly make you consider more things about people.

115
00:05:55.711 --> 00:05:59.630
And that adds to the overall surface area of knowledge that you have about

116
00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:00.464
people in general.

117
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.650
<v 1>I that absolutely.
Do you in your position,</v>

118
00:06:03.651 --> 00:06:05.120
because you have considerable influence,

119
00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:10.070
do you worry about having people kind of latch on things,
hive minded and,
and,

120
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.090
and go a direction,
but do you feel a responsibility,
I guess to people?
Right.

121
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.460
<v 0>But definitely feel responsibility and not manipulating them and it definitely</v>

122
00:06:16.461 --> 00:06:20.360
feel responsibility and not taking advantage of that and not starting a cult or

123
00:06:20.361 --> 00:06:23.390
something like that.
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,
but it's,

124
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.010
the good part about it is if you don't need anything from anybody,

125
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.720
like you're not trying to get people to send you $50 a month for the fucking,

126
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:32.990
you know,

127
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.990
platinum plan where you get access to the secret messages or no l Ron Hubbard or

128
00:06:38.661 --> 00:06:40.220
whatever.
Yeah.
But you know what I mean?

129
00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:43.460
It's like you can take advantage of people in,
in certain ways.

130
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.400
And I think that the,
that that's a,

131
00:06:46.401 --> 00:06:49.180
that's a real issue with any sort of hive mind thinking.
Right?

132
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.660
<v 1>And I,
yeah,
I don't know where I get I this,
this is fascinating.
I,</v>

133
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.980
I guess religion and things like that always troubled me and,

134
00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.640
and that hive mind mentality that,
that,
that,
that troubles me.

135
00:06:58.641 --> 00:07:01.900
It troubles me that,
I mean to be honest,

136
00:07:01.901 --> 00:07:04.070
it troubles me that Alex Jones was on hair or somebody who,

137
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.650
who kind of leads that sort of thing.

138
00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.220
<v 0>Yes.
But when Alex Jones is on here,</v>

139
00:07:08.221 --> 00:07:11.490
I think people got to understand Alice Jones way more after me getting him drunk

140
00:07:11.491 --> 00:07:14.490
and stoned and have a talk about interdimensional child molesters.

141
00:07:14.491 --> 00:07:16.170
Like you get to see a child like,
oh,

142
00:07:16.171 --> 00:07:21.171
this is kind of like a half wacky show or he's also commenting on the craziness

143
00:07:21.601 --> 00:07:24.600
of the world,
but you got to see who he really is.
What I,

144
00:07:24.601 --> 00:07:28.050
the guy that I've known for almost 20 years,
like that's what I wanted to do.

145
00:07:28.051 --> 00:07:31.530
By having them on,
like people are like,
why are you friends Doug?
I'm like,
watch,

146
00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.500
watch what happens.
We'll get them fucked up.
We're going to have some fun.

147
00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:38.040
And you'll realize like,
oh,
this guy is like,
he's kind of wacky.

148
00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:42.120
Like half of what he's doing is almost like a show.
Right?
It's a band,
right?

149
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.150
Well it's like an engine.
It is and that's kind of him.

150
00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.690
<v 1>People are buying into that,</v>

151
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:51.090
<v 0>but what are they buying into that's false and what are they buying into?</v>

152
00:07:51.091 --> 00:07:53.100
That's true.
Unfortunately,

153
00:07:53.101 --> 00:07:57.120
a lot of what Alex Jones has been presenting over these years is actually true.

154
00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:01.590
I'm like,
what?
Like agent provocateurs,
like when they have peaceful protests,

155
00:08:01.591 --> 00:08:05.070
they'll send in people to smash windows and they're wearing government issue

156
00:08:05.071 --> 00:08:09.390
boots and they get rounded up and they don't wind up being prosecuted because

157
00:08:09.391 --> 00:08:13.110
they were literally brought in by the police to turn a peaceful protest into a

158
00:08:13.111 --> 00:08:14.040
violent protest.

159
00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:19.220
Like the people that took over occupy Wall Street and undercover cops that were

160
00:08:19.411 --> 00:08:21.840
doing all this fucking crazy,
chaotic,

161
00:08:21.841 --> 00:08:26.841
violent shit to get people to move in and break up these camps and break up

162
00:08:27.031 --> 00:08:28.560
these protests when they were all legal.

163
00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.850
Alex Jones sort of expose all that stuff first

164
00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.720
<v 1>to support me.
And I don't want to be,
I actually don't want to be in this,</v>

165
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.580
I'm not trying to be controversial,
honestly.
I'm just like,
no.

166
00:08:37.581 --> 00:08:39.000
It's following conversation.
Express your,

167
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.860
when he puts his support behind people like Donald Trump,

168
00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:44.590
who is actually pushing these sorts of agendas,

169
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.190
what sorts of the that the anti protesting,

170
00:08:48.191 --> 00:08:51.060
like trying to change the laws so that you can run over protesters when there

171
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:54.190
peacefully and things like that.
I don't know whether he's changing the laws,

172
00:08:54.191 --> 00:08:58.590
but these things are coming.
It's something,
uh,
it's,
it was constant or Michigan.

173
00:08:58.591 --> 00:08:59.281
There's something like that.

174
00:08:59.281 --> 00:09:03.660
They're trying to put a thing into dates and whatever it is.
Yeah,
I know.
And I,

175
00:09:03.661 --> 00:09:06.090
I'm so bad because when I follow my train of thought,

176
00:09:06.091 --> 00:09:08.880
then I can never have citations and it drives me bananas because I don't want to

177
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:11.400
present information as speculation.
Right?

178
00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:15.660
<v 0>The people are trying to stop people from violating other people's rights.
Right.</v>

179
00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.800
<v 1>But is a person's right to drive a car down the street more important than a</v>

180
00:09:18.801 --> 00:09:23.300
person's right to express themselves by saying,
I don't want this to happen.

181
00:09:23.301 --> 00:09:27.380
I am willfully challenging the law right here in a peaceful way,

182
00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:29.020
<v 0>but it's not peaceful.</v>

183
00:09:29.021 --> 00:09:31.990
If your GRANDPA's dying and it needed to get to the hospital and some asshole

184
00:09:31.991 --> 00:09:34.570
wants to stand in front of him with a macrame hat on with a,
you know,

185
00:09:34.571 --> 00:09:35.770
I'm a male feminist sign,

186
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:36.733
<v 1>right?</v>

187
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:41.180
Are you quoting specifically talking about blocking people on the road?

188
00:09:41.181 --> 00:09:43.490
It doesn't help anyone.
It doesn't help anybody.
I mean,

189
00:09:43.491 --> 00:09:47.630
I've been arrested for political protests before and I was very aware.

190
00:09:47.631 --> 00:09:49.640
I was crossing a line on to here I was doing something.

191
00:09:49.641 --> 00:09:50.870
I was going to be arrested for it,

192
00:09:50.871 --> 00:09:54.680
but it was the voices behind me and the collective voices together that we're

193
00:09:54.681 --> 00:09:57.380
doing something not knowing that they were going to be arrested.

194
00:09:57.381 --> 00:10:00.650
Knowing that the part about going to jail and being able to write about or being

195
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.020
able to understand that you are taking a stance on something.

196
00:10:03.021 --> 00:10:06.740
You're just trying to bring attention to something that you think is wrong.
Oh,

197
00:10:06.741 --> 00:10:09.260
it was many years ago and all the military guys already hate me,

198
00:10:09.261 --> 00:10:13.250
but it was the school of the Americas.
I was 18.
I got arrested twice,

199
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:16.640
18 or 19.
Um,
it was a school in America is when they were,

200
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:20.450
they were teaching the counterinsurgency techniques,
um,
down at Fort Benning,

201
00:10:20.451 --> 00:10:23.600
Georgia.
I'm banned for life there,
but it was very religious.

202
00:10:23.601 --> 00:10:25.970
Then I was very into social justice.
I was really like,

203
00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.630
I wanted to be a nun and I wanted to change the world and I wanted people to not

204
00:10:29.631 --> 00:10:30.590
kill each other anymore.

205
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.910
And I wanted us not to fund military groups in South America who were

206
00:10:34.911 --> 00:10:38.180
slaughtering people at the same time.
It was protesting.

207
00:10:38.181 --> 00:10:41.150
I was stepping deliberately onto a military base and saying,
no,

208
00:10:41.151 --> 00:10:43.610
I don't want this to happen anymore.
I'm peaceful.
You gonna go with you.
I,

209
00:10:43.611 --> 00:10:46.140
you're arresting me.
I know my rights and the,
and,

210
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:51.570
<v 0>okay,
so let's unpack that.
What you did there was you made a,</v>

211
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:53.490
you up,
there's a political protest.

212
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.870
You went to the scene of where you think these terrible things are taking place

213
00:10:57.871 --> 00:11:00.540
and you took a stand knowing you were going to get arrested and that it was

214
00:11:00.541 --> 00:11:02.160
going to bring media attention to this.

215
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.240
There's a big difference between that and you deciding we're going to block the

216
00:11:06.241 --> 00:11:09.060
one oh one because black lives matter,
you know,

217
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.330
that doesn't have anything to do with all those people that were driving to
work.

218
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.990
You're violating their rights to pass.
You're violating their space.

219
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.740
You're stopping them from being able to move freely and a lot of them are

220
00:11:19.741 --> 00:11:21.180
private deal of attention to it.

221
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:25.830
You're doing it in a way that inconveniences and puts people in danger and it's

222
00:11:25.831 --> 00:11:28.050
not necessary.
You can do it in a public space.

223
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.120
You could do it in places where you're allowed to protest.

224
00:11:30.121 --> 00:11:34.050
You can do it and you could still get your voice out and still get your message

225
00:11:34.051 --> 00:11:38.220
out and not block traffic on the highway.
The blocking traffic on the highways,

226
00:11:38.221 --> 00:11:42.260
attention Horing and it's attention whoring in a very dangerous way because you

227
00:11:42.261 --> 00:11:45.480
are stopping people from getting to medication.

228
00:11:45.481 --> 00:11:47.550
You're stopping people from getting medical treatment.

229
00:11:47.551 --> 00:11:49.830
Your people can be in the middle of giving birth.

230
00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.810
There's a lot of shit that happens.
We you,

231
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.630
you fuck with people's ability to travel and move around,
we rely on that.

232
00:11:55.631 --> 00:12:00.280
It's extremely significant.
So when you just decide that you know,
you,

233
00:12:00.281 --> 00:12:02.890
whatever,
I want transgender rights for the bathroom,

234
00:12:02.891 --> 00:12:06.760
let's block this fucking highway.
Just because you think you can get attention.

235
00:12:06.761 --> 00:12:09.160
Doing something like that doesn't mean it's the right thing to do.

236
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:12.700
There are ways to get attention doing things that are lawful and there's ways

237
00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:16.270
that are noble and then there's blocking the fucking highway like a baby.

238
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:18.540
<v 1>Are they still working though?
I'm not just talking about in a highway.</v>

239
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:21.990
The are are,
are bringing attention to things.

240
00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:25.530
I mean is that still working the Dakota pipeline and stuff like that when people

241
00:12:25.531 --> 00:12:29.250
were protesting in a peaceful way,
did it shut it down?
Shut it down,
but it just,

242
00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:31.800
it's bad for Sam has changed.
It's not,

243
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:33.810
and I don't even know if that's the best example of it.

244
00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:37.420
<v 0>Good example because it was peaceful protesting and it did get a lot of</v>

245
00:12:37.421 --> 00:12:39.750
attention,
including me and a lot of other people who protest,

246
00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:43.570
who tweeted about it and put a blinks about it and let people know about and

247
00:12:43.571 --> 00:12:47.710
talked about it on the podcast.
Yeah,
I mean it does get attention.
The the tower,

248
00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:49.410
<v 1>I get it.</v>

249
00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:53.610
I understand what you're saying and I'm not protesting.

250
00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:58.500
They're disregarding what you're saying about the highways and stuff like that

251
00:12:58.501 --> 00:13:01.380
because that wouldn't be the kind of protest that I would want to be a part of.

252
00:13:01.381 --> 00:13:03.790
This not the kind of thing I would want to enact.
Now did I believe in,

253
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:06.210
do I believe in the black lives matter movement?
Yes,
to a certain extent.

254
00:13:06.211 --> 00:13:10.680
I also believe in police officer training and better training for police

255
00:13:10.681 --> 00:13:12.930
officers and those in situations of high stress.

256
00:13:12.931 --> 00:13:16.680
I think that there's so much nuance to what's going on there and there's so much

257
00:13:16.681 --> 00:13:20.400
carried on and and the the highway blocking and the stuff like that.

258
00:13:20.401 --> 00:13:24.420
You're giving very,
very good counter arguments to,

259
00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:25.441
to this.

260
00:13:25.441 --> 00:13:29.430
But I will say that there's also something in effect when you can make the

261
00:13:29.431 --> 00:13:33.900
loudest noise
and you know something is wrong,

262
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:38.040
isn't it?
Your responsibility to try and fix things,
not by stopping the highway.

263
00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:41.040
Maybe not,
maybe not.
Maybe it's not.
So by stopping the highway,

264
00:13:41.041 --> 00:13:44.760
but if people are so determined to be against what you're saying there.
So in,

265
00:13:44.761 --> 00:13:48.970
in Rudy,
you people have to make noise in the strangest ways they have to do what

266
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.260
<v 0>people are very self righteous and they think that you have to listen to them</v>

267
00:13:52.261 --> 00:13:54.540
and you don't want to listen to them.
No,
you don't want to,
right.

268
00:13:54.541 --> 00:13:58.530
As an American to not have to listen to someone's protest as much as it's your

269
00:13:58.531 --> 00:14:00.300
right as an American,
a protest.
It is.

270
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.060
You can't force someone to listen to you because you think you're right.

271
00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:05.760
And that's what you're doing by standing in front of someone on the highway in

272
00:14:05.761 --> 00:14:06.730
blocking their passage.

273
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:10.280
<v 1>Okay.
But getting beyond the highway thing,
because again,
what you're bringing on,</v>

274
00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.540
<v 0>I have an issue with,
okay.
Okay.
Real literally,</v>

275
00:14:12.541 --> 00:14:14.250
I have no problem with protesting I think.

276
00:14:14.251 --> 00:14:17.130
But when you protesting on the highway and you're blocking traffic,

277
00:14:17.131 --> 00:14:19.610
you're a cunt.
I mean that's a shitty way to do it.

278
00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:24.420
<v 1>I,
I cannot disagree with you to a certain extent where it is a very inconvenient</v>

279
00:14:24.421 --> 00:14:25.680
thing and it can be a dangerous thing.

280
00:14:25.681 --> 00:14:28.830
And I don't think any protesting should endanger peoples lives at all.

281
00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:32.270
By the way.
I don't hate marathons too for the same reason.
Yeah.

282
00:14:32.271 --> 00:14:36.120
Well I mean it makes a lot of sense.
Those are scheduled.

283
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.690
I don't think that that's um,
caused to be able to have the right to,

284
00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.840
to run somebody over and kill me.
No,

285
00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:45.720
you shouldn't have the right to life is not worth something because they're

286
00:14:45.721 --> 00:14:47.620
expressing themselves in a way that you disagree with.

287
00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.030
<v 0>No,
but that's not necessarily what the law is saying.</v>

288
00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:53.480
No law saying that you someone responsibility if someone jumps in front of your

289
00:14:53.481 --> 00:14:55.270
car and tries to stop you that we've seen,

290
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:59.000
he brings Saul people smashed their car windows because they're trying to get

291
00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:01.730
through some sort of a protest line and they don't have anything to do with what

292
00:15:01.731 --> 00:15:03.470
the protest is.
They just want to get out of there.

293
00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:06.320
I were in their car and their stock and maybe they have their kid with them and

294
00:15:06.321 --> 00:15:08.450
the kids crying and freaking out and they hit the gas.

295
00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:12.720
<v 1>Incredibly
detailed.</v>

296
00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.720
This is an incredibly detailed example of some that I don't actually have the

297
00:15:15.721 --> 00:15:17.790
reference point to.
I don't have a citation for this,

298
00:15:17.791 --> 00:15:21.390
so I can't argue with you on any of the story that you're giving me because I

299
00:15:21.391 --> 00:15:24.690
have no way of knowing this,
this incident,

300
00:15:24.691 --> 00:15:27.020
but I do think that your speculation is correct in,

301
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.090
in the sense that I think that no,
that would be horrible.

302
00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.960
That would be horrible to have people saying,
okay,
this means more to me.

303
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:37.410
Then you're getting your kid to your sick kid to the hospital.

304
00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:39.780
I think absolutely.
I think that that,
no,

305
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:42.720
I don't think that anybody's life is worth more than another person's life.

306
00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:44.190
<v 0>What's also,
there's something going on with,</v>

307
00:15:44.191 --> 00:15:47.370
there's a lot of misdirected rage and anger.
Like my friend was very angry.

308
00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.160
My friend was at one of these things where he was trying to get his car through

309
00:15:50.161 --> 00:15:53.340
and they were all blocked and stopped and people had crossed hands,

310
00:15:53.341 --> 00:15:56.880
locked hands and blocked the highway and some guy came up to his window and is

311
00:15:56.881 --> 00:16:00.630
screaming,
black lives matter,
black lives matter,
screaming at his window.

312
00:16:00.631 --> 00:16:04.020
He's like,
yeah,
I agree man.
Okay,
I'm a great,
but I'm stuck in traffic.

313
00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:04.891
Why are you yelling at me?

314
00:16:04.891 --> 00:16:08.370
I'm not doing anything like were very angry right now because like this white

315
00:16:08.371 --> 00:16:11.220
guy yelling at him,
another white guy and he's screaming,

316
00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:15.120
black lives matter at him.
It's like,
okay,
this is so misdirected.

317
00:16:15.121 --> 00:16:19.410
If my friend is a Democrat,
votes liberal,
he's so,
so liberal,

318
00:16:19.411 --> 00:16:22.380
like down the board with a pretty much everything and someone's screaming at him

319
00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.320
and screaming at him like he has done something wrong because this person is

320
00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.700
misguided and misdirected rage and they're,

321
00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.410
they're a part of this whole mob mentality.
Everyone's together,

322
00:16:31.411 --> 00:16:34.440
they're all chanting and yelling and everyone's getting excited and they think

323
00:16:34.441 --> 00:16:36.420
that they're doing the right thing.
And these kids today,

324
00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.090
a lot of them that are involved in these protests,

325
00:16:39.091 --> 00:16:42.420
they're so enamored by this idea that they're doing the right thing.

326
00:16:42.421 --> 00:16:43.560
They're enacting change.

327
00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:47.160
They don't realize that they're also polarizing the opposition,

328
00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.890
and this is one of the reasons why Donald Trump was elected in the first place

329
00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:53.580
because so many people are so tired of people shoving in their face.

330
00:16:53.581 --> 00:16:57.330
They're righteous indignation shoving in their face is locking hands and

331
00:16:57.331 --> 00:16:59.430
blocking the highway and you have to listen to us.

332
00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:03.330
That is energy and it goes like this.
And then when it goes like that,

333
00:17:03.331 --> 00:17:06.060
people go like that.
It's in and out.
There's a cycle.

334
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.400
<v 1>And can you understand where the rage is built up of?</v>

335
00:17:08.401 --> 00:17:12.780
People felt like they've been ignored and they've been pushed back so hard that

336
00:17:12.781 --> 00:17:15.630
they actually start exploding like that and they get into these hives cause they

337
00:17:15.631 --> 00:17:15.770
have

338
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:17.060
<v 0>no other group to belong to.</v>

339
00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.810
There's definitely a way that you could see that.

340
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:22.550
There's definitely a way that makes sense.

341
00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:25.880
I guess what is the appropriate way to do things?
The way to do,

342
00:17:25.881 --> 00:17:29.360
to continue to write,
to continue to talk,

343
00:17:29.361 --> 00:17:33.770
to continue to express yourself in a way that's going to make other people

344
00:17:33.771 --> 00:17:37.740
consider what you're saying and maybe change people's minds and thoughts and,

345
00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:40.700
and it's not an instantaneous thing.
That's the problem.

346
00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.590
Not like you put up a sign and everything's fixed.

347
00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:45.170
<v 1>No,
we turned his tone.
We are a society that um,</v>

348
00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:45.500
<v 0>right.</v>

349
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.260
Well I think that's part of the rage of people screaming as they want it to

350
00:17:48.261 --> 00:17:51.150
change now and by going up to my friend's window and yelling,

351
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:54.330
black lives matter this fuck.
Head thinks he's going to change,

352
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.390
but he's doesn't even really think that.
He thinks he's got the right to do it.

353
00:17:57.391 --> 00:17:58.950
And you've got to fucking listen to me,
man.

354
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:03.750
There's this thing going on where people get these mob mindsets where they think

355
00:18:03.751 --> 00:18:07.620
they're allowed to hit a girl because she's got a red hat on that says make

356
00:18:07.621 --> 00:18:09.900
bitcoin great again.
Have you seen that video?

357
00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.680
That poor girl got maced in the face?
Horrible was a Joe cat.

358
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.660
They may stir in the fucking face.

359
00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:20.460
<v 1>I get that.
I get what you're saying.
And I'm,
I'm,
I am on board with,</v>

360
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:23.750
with the sentiment of what you're saying.
I really do understand it,

361
00:18:23.751 --> 00:18:25.560
but I also think there's such a,

362
00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:30.940
a finger pointing going on and I'm guilty of it on my Twitter because I go after

363
00:18:31.131 --> 00:18:34.520
these fuck heads all the time.
They call it usually.
Yeah,
you Feminazi and I say,

364
00:18:34.521 --> 00:18:37.790
no,
fuck Donald Trump.
Seriously,
that person is not qualified to be president.

365
00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:39.530
Well,
Hillary's bad too.
It was like,
that's not,

366
00:18:39.531 --> 00:18:40.960
I didn't say anything about Hillary.
I said,

367
00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:45.950
this person in office is not qualified.
He should step down.
Um,
but I,

368
00:18:45.951 --> 00:18:48.500
and can I really wanted to be president?
No,

369
00:18:48.501 --> 00:18:52.940
I don't think he wanted to be president at all.
Yeah.
No,
I think he's terrified.

370
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:55.220
He is a scared,
terrified little man up there.

371
00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:59.290
<v 0>He's not terrified.
Maybe he's crazy,
but he,
I don't think you wanted to do this.</v>

372
00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:00.520
It's just sort of happen.

373
00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:01.421
<v 1>Yeah.
I think,</v>

374
00:19:01.421 --> 00:19:04.870
I think he didn't think it through and I think that's when we're talking about

375
00:19:04.871 --> 00:19:07.660
not thinking it through.
I think the guy screaming at your friend in the window,

376
00:19:07.661 --> 00:19:09.430
he's not thinking it through.
He's caught on to something.

377
00:19:09.431 --> 00:19:10.960
He's caught up in a wave of something.

378
00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.730
<v 0>There's a million other people behind them.
Everyone's screaming,</v>

379
00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:15.740
he's looking at my friend,
my friend's vulnerable,

380
00:19:15.741 --> 00:19:18.640
my friends below him cause he's seated and he's just screaming.
Yeah,

381
00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.430
<v 1>black lives matter.
Black lives matter.
It's like,
okay.
Yeah.</v>

382
00:19:22.431 --> 00:19:24.980
And it's that bullshit.
But it's it.

383
00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:29.780
It's also about Twitter generation protesting eight,
you know?
But it's also,

384
00:19:29.781 --> 00:19:30.740
we have learned,

385
00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:35.240
it's so hard to just generalize and say everything is because of this and

386
00:19:35.241 --> 00:19:36.690
everything is because of that,
isn't it?
Yeah.

387
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:40.520
Everything has to come from an individual place and at the same time,

388
00:19:40.521 --> 00:19:42.050
we're all trying to belong to communities.

389
00:19:42.051 --> 00:19:44.580
We're all trying to belong to something we believe in,
right.
And,

390
00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:45.950
and we're latching onto that.

391
00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:49.310
And then I think that the sins that happen in the sense that we would ever then

392
00:19:49.311 --> 00:19:51.920
that happened along the way,
the missteps that happened along the way,

393
00:19:51.921 --> 00:19:55.970
we tend to forgive them instead of pointing out,
no,
you shouldn't do this.

394
00:19:55.971 --> 00:19:59.240
You shouldn't affect somebody who's driving their child to work or something

395
00:19:59.241 --> 00:20:00.950
like that.
But that's not what should happen.

396
00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.430
But we do tend to forgive the people who are in the same team as us.
Don't wait,

397
00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:08.840
of course.
And that's where the,
the make America great fuckers.
Sorry.
I think,

398
00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:10.250
well we did you go out of that,

399
00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:14.130
they can't see their team lose and they'll defend him now to the death of defend

400
00:20:14.131 --> 00:20:16.580
his decisions.
He does something wrong.
Well,
you don't understand how it works,

401
00:20:16.581 --> 00:20:18.770
do you?
No,
I actually,
I do understand how it works.

402
00:20:18.771 --> 00:20:20.800
This person is not supposed to be in power.

403
00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:24.740
This person's not supposed to represent America.
This is,
and,
and,
and he is,

404
00:20:24.741 --> 00:20:27.200
and he's not who I want the world to see America as.

405
00:20:27.201 --> 00:20:29.630
I think we're a great country and we fuck up a lot.
Yeah.

406
00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.440
<v 0>This is also a problem when having a popularity contest to decide who gets to</v>

407
00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:33.891
run things.

408
00:20:33.891 --> 00:20:37.310
Imagine if they had a popularity contest to get to see who the dean of Harvard.

409
00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.350
Yeah.
Like what's a corrector going to be this year?

410
00:20:39.351 --> 00:20:40.520
The curriculum is going to be Jesus.

411
00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:43.310
<v 1>All right.
I will,
I need,</v>

412
00:20:43.311 --> 00:20:46.040
that's what's going to be happening right now are getting do away with the

413
00:20:46.041 --> 00:20:48.580
public.
All the vouchers and the shit that's happening.

414
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:52.080
There's a lot of weird shit on a Jeff sessions.
Guy Scares her shit.
Oh my God.

415
00:20:52.081 --> 00:20:53.980
He wants to bring back,
just say no.
Yeah.

416
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:56.830
My spring back to 19 he's just saying he,
okay.
He just said,

417
00:20:56.831 --> 00:20:59.600
and the marijuana has the same negative effects is heroin,

418
00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:03.910
which slightly less bad than heroin.
What the Hell Dude,
like child,

419
00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:09.360
an old child and it's,
yeah,
it's not good.
No,
it's not good.
And,

420
00:21:09.361 --> 00:21:11.950
and I,
I,
cause I get worked up thinking about it,

421
00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:13.520
but do you know about these people in power?
And I got it.

422
00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.270
<v 0>As you get worked out and people get worked up rather,</v>

423
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:19.570
and they start talking about it and they also realize that,
hey man,

424
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:21.160
it really does matter if you vote,

425
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:23.200
it really does matter if you're politically active,
right.

426
00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:25.300
It really doesn't matter if you talk about these things that you care,

427
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:30.100
but the team mentality that we have,
the US versus them,
it just gets so weird.

428
00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:33.940
It gets so fucking crazy.
People get so out of control with it and they,

429
00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:36.250
like you said,
they the people that make America great again,

430
00:21:36.251 --> 00:21:38.370
people they don't want to hear shit about the left.

431
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:40.270
They didn't want to hear shit about Bernie.

432
00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:44.620
They want to say Barack Obama's a Muslim and from fucking Kenya

433
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.790
<v 1>and I'm guilty of not wanting to know good things about Donald Trump.
Yeah,</v>

434
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.340
I don't want to know them.
I don't care.
I don't,

435
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.790
I don't care because I see so much.
You know?

436
00:21:54.791 --> 00:21:57.550
It's just like there's so much that's working against human achievement with him

437
00:21:57.551 --> 00:22:00.400
being in power and the people he's appointing,
empower.
It is

438
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:04.790
<v 0>think it gives people a goal.
I think it gives people like,</v>

439
00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:08.510
I think without opposition it's very difficult to get motivated.

440
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:12.080
And I think there's a significant amount of opposition now.
And people were,

441
00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:15.500
I think they're organizing people on the left are organizing in a way that they

442
00:22:15.501 --> 00:22:19.010
never have before.
And hopefully,
hopefully people understand their,

443
00:22:19.011 --> 00:22:23.120
there'll be someone along the line that understands that the polarization effect

444
00:22:23.121 --> 00:22:26.720
that happens between choosing these hard line teams left and right,

445
00:22:26.721 --> 00:22:30.290
and not recognizing the possibility that there's so many people in the middle

446
00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.590
that just pick a side.
They just decided to go left or decided to go.
Right.

447
00:22:33.591 --> 00:22:36.740
And they could be on either side,
but both of them are unreasonable.

448
00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:39.440
Both of them are unrealistic.
Yeah.
You know,
and yeah,

449
00:22:39.441 --> 00:22:41.120
Hillary Clinton was a terrible candidate.

450
00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:42.710
She was a terrible opposition candidate.

451
00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:45.650
Hopefully next time they'll be someone that's really good and will understand

452
00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:50.600
what is the problem with having a medical maniacal Egomaniac who a fucking,
uh,

453
00:22:50.601 --> 00:22:52.940
a business vulture run,
run the country.

454
00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:56.540
<v 1>Yeah.
Which happened,
I mean,
that was the choice.
This one and this like,
you know,</v>

455
00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:05.590
<v 2>okay.</v>
