1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.290
Yeah,
no dude and cocaine.
Oh,
go back to that vest store,
man.

2
00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:08.910
So here's what happened.
So I,
you know,
I would get,
I would do some cocaine,

3
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:13.170
it thousand put on these different vests.
I don't know,

4
00:00:13.171 --> 00:00:16.080
I spent too much on them,
but I would probably say

5
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.700
the priciest one I had was probably about $210 90 damn.
Yeah.

6
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.520
And so I would get fucked up and put these vests on and put on sunglasses and

7
00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:30.270
not met.
No,
like Buffalo Bill Shit.
But at least party and by myself,
you know.

8
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.510
And one time was making a smoothie,
you know,
cause I,
you know,
I have,

9
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.850
I've got like a new on what kind of blender it is,

10
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:39.330
but it was pretty nice and I was making like a nice smoothie and I'm fucking

11
00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:40.950
coked up on party and you know,

12
00:00:40.951 --> 00:00:44.650
live in high on the hog at this two vests on maybe.
Right.
And I thought,

13
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.220
I thought I heard something outside.
Right.

14
00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:50.910
Which is kind of weird to even think of when you have a blender going.
Right.

15
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.400
So I'll leave out of my apartment to go in the hallway,

16
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.210
lock myself out with the blender going

17
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.980
<v 1>during the morning,
coked up out of my brain.
I have to go to my landlord,
dude,</v>

18
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.730
who lives right down the hall and tell him like,
hey man,

19
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.580
the more I got locked out,
blend on saying,
oh my God,

20
00:01:12.581 --> 00:01:16.630
he must have hated you.
Oh,
the blender shorts out and smoke happens.

21
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.090
The fire alarm starts going off

22
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.830
<v 0>in the building,
right as I'm ad is door knocking right now.</v>

23
00:01:22.831 --> 00:01:26.460
He's pissed and he's like,
what's going on?
And I didn't know what to say.

24
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:30.030
I told him that I was throwing a late Christmas party.

25
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.930
<v 1>It was fucking into January.
I will with you at the time,
Huh?
Oh,</v>

26
00:01:35.931 --> 00:01:39.290
this is two and a half years ago.
So I was 30 35

27
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.650
so he comes back to my apartment,
right?
He's,
he unlocks the door.

28
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.690
There's nobody in there.

29
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.290
Oh my God.
I'm like,
man.
But that's it.
It was fun.
But it was,

30
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.070
oh my God,
that was fun.

31
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.190
<v 0>You lived there for,
I still live there.
Whoa.
Yeah.</v>

32
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.260
<v 1>Passionate kind.
You know,
like I've caught him doing some things.</v>

33
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.790
I think we're all even,
how long have you been sober for

34
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.120
<v 0>year?
In two weeks.
It'll be two years.
What was the big thing where you like,</v>

35
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.020
I gotta get my shit together.
You need that.
How it was going on.
Opie and Jim,

36
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.820
when opie and Jim Norton had a radio show at serious and it was actually on,
uh,

37
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.130
it's on Ari's,
that show that he had,
this is not happening.
Um,
and I ended up,

38
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.900
uh,
doing coke all night driving a taxi.
I was in a taxi.

39
00:02:40.901 --> 00:02:45.880
The driver is dude,
Luigi,
um,
got me an escort.

40
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.840
I didn't want to ask or were doing cocaine and like Harlem or something North

41
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.350
Harlan,
the cabdriver doing coke.
And I just had,

42
00:02:53.351 --> 00:02:55.600
I was taking a cab from a party to my hotel.

43
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.290
And so we ended up off on this other excursion.
Next,
you know,

44
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.870
I'm driving the taxi,
he's in the back with the hooker.

45
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.900
It's five 30 in the morning and I got to be on the radio station at,
you know,

46
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.760
six 30 or something.
So I get to the radio and I can't even talk.

47
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.230
And uh,
and Darryl strawberry's the other guest,
right?

48
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.800
Who's the baseball player who also had drug problem,

49
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.090
but he's like 13 years sober.
And so it was this weird moment where like,

50
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.360
I thought I was kind of cool,
but then here's a man who like,

51
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.780
I'd always in my head maybe somewhere thought,
oh,
that guy's like a coke head.

52
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.550
But then here he is eloquent,
put together successful.
And here I am,

53
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:37.810
I can't even talk.
And I'm with two men that I admire.
Um,
you know,

54
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:40.570
opie and Jim Norton,
just to be honored to be on the show,
you know?

55
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:44.580
And so I was like,
this is,
um,
I'm not making choices.
Like there's some,

56
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.450
there's some unevenness here,
you know?

57
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.320
So what did you do after the 212 step programs and 12 step program?
Yeah.

58
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.580
And then,
so yeah,
so I've been in that then since then,
it has helped me out,

59
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:55.060
you know.
