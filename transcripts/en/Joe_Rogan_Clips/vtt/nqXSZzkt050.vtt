00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.480
I remember there was a pizza parlor when I was a kid.
His name was nick,

2
00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:06.960
the Greek fucking tremendous pizza,
even though he was Greek,

3
00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:07.980
like we let it slide.

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.570
He put the Sicilian by the window and there was with the flies will land on it.

5
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.790
It was like the airport for the flies.

6
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:17.610
They were late and we were breaking his balls neck,
but I'm in,

7
00:00:17.611 --> 00:00:21.480
I want an antiquated one night fucked up to the gills with vomit all over my

8
00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:25.200
shirt and every time he'd see me call me fucking Belushi.

9
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.790
That's Belushi almost died.
It was and he would have for years.

10
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.980
He called me fucking Belushi and there was another kid who had a beard and he

11
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.970
called them.
I told her command like he had nicknames for us,
but that's a weird,

12
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.470
it bothered me.
After a while he would call me Belushi and when Belushi died,

13
00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:45.600
it really started bothering me like my next,

14
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.110
he would call me Belushi till my face will look when his fucking Belushi hello.

15
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.130
I was fucked up.
I want to know when that on a quail,

16
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.770
it opened up the red pepper and threw it at him and blazers sell them jewelry.

17
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.680
Like I would sell them stolen.
Jimmy and nick would tight.

18
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.560
Nick was the pizza parlor,

19
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.550
50 yards from the high school and you could run a tab with nick and nick used
to,

20
00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:12.210
I used to give nick jewelry and he would look at me and he would go speak.

21
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.460
How much do you think that's worth?
Cause Jewelry was 800 an ounce at that time.

22
00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:22.260
Gold.
And I would bring him jewelry,
he would look at it and then take it,

23
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:26.670
give me money and put it in in one of his pockets from is does a front apron.

24
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So two days later I'd go in there and go,
nick,
let me use your bathroom.

25
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:32.910
And I go in there and stick my hand in the apron and take the jewelry back.

26
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.180
And then a week later I go back to him,
nick,
how much for the ring?

27
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.300
And he looked at me and he was racist as fuck.

28
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.890
Like he would either quality Belushi or Spec to my face.
Like,
it didn't matter.

29
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.550
There was a kid,
you know,
this is on Kennedy Boulevard,
this is a big boulevard,

30
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.760
and there was a kid that would come in there and I'm still dear friends with

31
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.720
that.
His family had money and he would go in there and buy a slice of pizza,

32
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.730
but he would cross the street because the ice t across the street was a dime

33
00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:06.180
cheaper and more than ice.
Tea came in those fucking cardboard and milk,

34
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.150
cardboard.
He would always cross the street.

35
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.970
So nick would be having a conversation and it's like,
what's going on?

36
00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:13.860
And also they go west and we'd go,

37
00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:18.480
he went across the street to get the ice cream.
He would fucking flip out.

38
00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:21.780
He'd run from behind the counter,
run onto the county boulevard.

39
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.250
Hundreds of people be out there and he'd yell at the Kid,
Tony,

40
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.600
you fucking jewel.
You fuck you.
Fuck.

41
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.520
He wasn't Jewish,
he was Italian.
He was just cheap and shit like that.
That's it.

42
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.960
10 centers that you gotta be pretty cheap to run across the street.

43
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.960
There was 45 cents for the ice tea,
but it,

44
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.030
Ashley's was 35 cents right across the street.
Then the hash ways,

45
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.410
Delhi was great because the mother was losing the hair show.

46
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.550
Every time he got a sandwich,
you get a little piece of hang,
you know,

47
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.360
and so you'd get,
you wouldn't get hair,
you'd go Ms. Harris,

48
00:02:56.361 --> 00:02:59.010
you didn't get near O'hare.
Everything had a little piece,

49
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.010
a heroin at the macaroni salad and he ate it.
Gave him a fuck.

50
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:07.550
There was tremendous,
she made the best roast beef on Rye in the world,
but every,

51
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.291
no,
in fact,

52
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:13.291
the whole family to her and the son will losing the hat and I learned from her

53
00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:15.310
son,
like her son was losing his head,

54
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.690
but he couldn't control his emotions about it.
He went to everything.
Joe,

55
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.680
he did the fucking stitches.
He would spray paint his hair.

56
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.850
He was one of those guys that had like,
he tried,

57
00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:31.390
but the head just kept falling out.
He had a male pattern,

58
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:35.140
whatever we were kids.
The mom had it to the mom hat.

59
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.630
They read something in the house.
I don't know what it was,

60
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:41.800
and you could test the dad had it and the brother had it and fucking everything.

61
00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:45.370
You got to have a little piece of hair on it,
whatever.

62
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:48.680
You got to always have that.
If you didn't get,
you were like beat.

63
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.640
His ass was so bad.
He just said to her face,
oh,

64
00:03:53.641 --> 00:03:56.470
we used to torture all the time.
We Love Mrs Hat.
