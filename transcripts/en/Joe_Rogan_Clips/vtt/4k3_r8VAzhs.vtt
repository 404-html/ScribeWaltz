Do you think that the Scandinavian model that has revealed that when you do make

2
00:00:05.851 --> 00:00:06.900
things more equal,

3
00:00:06.901 --> 00:00:11.901
you will find that people generally tend to gravitate more towards traditional

4
00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:15.000
gender roles that th th does this,

5
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.030
do you think that this makes people happier?

6
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.560
Has it been observed that this is a uh Huh

7
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.210
<v 1>beer result?
That's a good question though.</v>

8
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.640
The indices of life satisfaction are pretty high and Scandinavia,

9
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:34.070
but I don't know if anybody has done an analysis that would indicate whether
the,

10
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.560
the sexual sorting is a contributor to that.
Oh,

11
00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:41.400
that's a good question.
I mean,
the,

12
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.920
the general idea has been that the Scandinavians are happier because their

13
00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:48.740
societies are more egalitarian,
but,

14
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.920
but they're not more egalitarian in the sense that men and women are also more

15
00:00:53.961 --> 00:00:57.890
different.
So men and women are more different,

16
00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:01.880
but the opportunities are more egalitarian.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So,
but so then,

17
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.490
and then the societies are more,
are more satisfied,

18
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.460
but it's tough because there's other variables because the Scandinavian

19
00:01:07.461 --> 00:01:10.640
countries are relatively homogenous.
Right.

20
00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:15.200
And more homogenous societies tend to be more peaceful and happier,

21
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.850
not,
not more diverse societies.
And they're also small countries,

22
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.880
so they're somewhat easier to govern and they tend to be wealthy.

23
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.630
So those,
so it'd be hard to parse out all those contributors,
right.

24
00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:34.610
To figure out what it is that's making the Scandinavians relatively,
um,
content.

25
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.480
This is almost like a super tribe versus a country.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.

26
00:01:38.481 --> 00:01:42.080
Well in and those,
those sorts of societies in some sense are easier to manage.

27
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.680
So there any benefit to this,
this

28
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.120
<v 0>model that we could perhaps bring to the United States or to Canada and maybe</v>

29
00:01:52.121 --> 00:01:55.840
mitigate some of the issues that we have between the right and the left.

30
00:01:55.841 --> 00:01:59.340
Like maybe there's some sort of a compromise that will lead to a,

31
00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:01.230
a less less debate

32
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.160
<v 1>dispute.
Well,
I think that you guys in the states are doing real well actually.</v>

33
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.600
Personally.
I mean,
you know,
your,

34
00:02:10.601 --> 00:02:13.840
your system of checks and balances seems to work out pretty well.

35
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.650
There's a fair bit of,
let's say left domination right now of,

36
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.210
of the mainstream media.

37
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.100
I think that's a reasonable claim and also of academia and of the
intelligentsia.

38
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.910
But the political system is skewed pretty hard to the Republican end of things

39
00:02:27.911 --> 00:02:31.780
at the moment.
And so that's not a bad balance.
And then in the last election,

40
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.880
I mean it may be you could make a case perhaps that things had tilted a little

41
00:02:36.881 --> 00:02:40.600
too far to the republican side,
but that they had got balanced out because the,

42
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.560
the Democrats took the house again and it seems like they were more moderate

43
00:02:44.561 --> 00:02:48.790
Democrats.
That seems to be the Scuttlebutt.
So,
you know,

44
00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:52.330
it isn't obvious to me that your system isn't functioning well.

45
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.630
I think that one of the things that's happening that's making things look more

46
00:02:58.031 --> 00:03:03.031
contentious than they is that the mainstream media is under such assault by the

47
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.430
up and coming media forms,
including people like you,

48
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.090
that as their financial models deteriorate and as their journalistic standards

49
00:03:17.171 --> 00:03:17.741
take a hit,

50
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:21.040
and as they lose their fact checkers and their time to be careful with the

51
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:25.600
stories,
they concentrate more on exaggerating the extremes to attract attention.

52
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.011
And so,
you know,

53
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:30.550
there was an article published in the Atlantic monthly about a month ago showing

54
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:33.280
that didn't,
it depends on how you calculate these things,

55
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:37.360
but that the radical leftists and the radical right wingers are only about 5% of

56
00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:40.190
the population on each side.
And that Mo,

57
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.680
the vast majority of Americans considered themselves something approximating the

58
00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:46.540
relatively silent majority.

59
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.110
And so I don't think that things are polarized is as badly as they seem.

60
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.150
And it is also the case right now that if you poll people and ask them about the

61
00:03:58.151 --> 00:04:00.130
conditions of their life in the United States,

62
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:04.090
they tend to say that they're doing quite well,
but that other people aren't.

63
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.950
And so I think maybe,
I don't know this for sure,
but,
but I,

64
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.670
I think maybe that the technological pressure that's being put on the mainstream

65
00:04:12.671 --> 00:04:17.671
media is driving extreme political views as a means of gathering the attention

66
00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:23.080
of a shrinking market share.
That's,
that's a very interesting take on it.

67
00:04:23.081 --> 00:04:27.760
And I wonder how detrimental that is to us as a whole because we are constantly

68
00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:31.810
dealing with this click bait headline,
you know,
and every,

69
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.990
every everything is a dispute.
Everything's a war.
Everything's,

70
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.670
it's nerve wracking.
You know,
I mean,
I noticed this years ago,
cause I,

71
00:04:38.671 --> 00:04:42.040
I really stopped watching the news old 25 years ago,

72
00:04:42.041 --> 00:04:44.500
although I've been heavily involved in,
in the last two years.

73
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.940
Cause I noticed that most of what passed for news wasn't because my sense was,

74
00:04:48.941 --> 00:04:52.510
well,
if it isn't important in a month,
if it isn't important a month from now,

75
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:53.710
it was never important.

76
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.040
And almost everything that's news is like important right now.

77
00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.240
And so I tried to stay away from that and it was better for my peace of mind.

78
00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:05.680
And I often recommended to my clinical clients who were depressed and anxious

79
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:09.460
that they shield themselves from the news as much as possible.

80
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.230
But now there's the news is everywhere,
right?
It's everywhere.
It's Twitter,

81
00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:17.620
it's Facebook,
it's youtube.
It's like we're just inundated by it.

82
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.540
It's like CNN on steroids.

83
00:05:19.541 --> 00:05:23.890
It's 24 hour news cycle and it's produced by everyone,
whether they're,

84
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.700
um,
informed or not.
And it's really high emotion.

85
00:05:27.701 --> 00:05:31.900
And I think that that is making things look a lot worse to us than they actually

86
00:05:31.901 --> 00:05:32.110
are.
