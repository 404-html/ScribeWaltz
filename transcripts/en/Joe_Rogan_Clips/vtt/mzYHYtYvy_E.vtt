1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.460
The done.
Thankfully he was into the rice shit.

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.620
But I would see him go on stage and I would see his humility.
He wouldn't,

3
00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:11.820
he would always say Java is the ability of anything that I have.

4
00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:16.200
He would always give praises to the most high to Jah.
Rastafari.

5
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.130
Humble is fucking hell and the best musicians to ever,

6
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.380
those four motherfuckers are praised by every single fuck.
The musician today,

7
00:00:25.381 --> 00:00:27.030
if you talk doc,
Daryl,

8
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.360
Earl and Gary doctor know every motherfucking musician out there will be like

9
00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:35.340
those dudes are the fucking dance cause they study music.

10
00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:39.270
They were into jazz and they were into fucking return to forever.

11
00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:44.271
And John McLaughlin Mahavishnu doc in 81 was like they call me squids cause they

12
00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:49.500
met me in an Ey.
Yo squids,
I want to take you to the palladium returned to fair.

13
00:00:49.501 --> 00:00:52.840
One of the coaches quit cause I was that they met me in the navy.
Oh squids.

14
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.360
Like a squid.
You'll squids.
It's hilarious.
Yeah.

15
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.500
And then uh,
and then they call me Johnny Joe.
So that's where the John Joseph,

16
00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:05.400
I didn't use my last name cause I was foregoing a future.
If for 15 years.
Oh,

17
00:01:05.401 --> 00:01:09.880
that's funny.
Yeah.
So,
uh,
the,
the thing was he's,
you know,

18
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.250
returned to forever is owl Demille,
Ola,
Lenny white,
Stanley Clarke.

19
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.320
And I'm missing chicory.
Fucking do you ever listen to this shit?

20
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.080
So you want to go down a motherfucker?
No.
Listen,

21
00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:25.860
to return to forever romantic word.
You want to go down a rabbit hole?
We'd,

22
00:01:25.861 --> 00:01:29.850
how fucking amazing these fucking musicians are,

23
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.770
or weather report where any of these,
you know,
Maha Vishnu,
birds of fire.

24
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.740
Like they started turning me and he was say,
squids,

25
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.040
this is how we learn to play with the fuck we play.

26
00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:45.420
And nobody could touch the bad brains musically,
energy on stage,
nothing.

27
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.870
And I would see these dudes,
I'd be like,
what the fuck are you into?

28
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.790
And then the role models that,
like you said,
it,
you know,

29
00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:56.430
we need good role models.
There's,
there's,
you know,

30
00:01:56.431 --> 00:02:01.080
there's so many fucked up people that,
uh,
these kids want to emulate today.

31
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.750
You know,
and I see it cause I came up in New York,

32
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.770
I worked in all the underground hip hop clubs.
I work for the pope a pot.

33
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.080
I used to deliver pot to all the rap stars.
I delivered pot pot.

34
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.920
My friend,
uh,
does to Matt Work for Tristar.
He's like,
Yo,

35
00:02:16.921 --> 00:02:18.450
meet me at the Boston Comedy Club.

36
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.560
There's this black comedian there and he's going to be fucking huge.

37
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.400
And I would show up on my bike.
And you know who you know,
who the fuck it was?

38
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.280
Dave Chappelle.
They fuck Chapelle they focus your pell.

39
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.290
And when he did half bake,

40
00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:34.740
did you notice that he put the weed delivery guy in all bike gear?

41
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.600
We'll fuck you think you got that phone.
I used to show up.
I never carried a bag.

42
00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:44.601
I showed up with a $4,000 carbon fiber carbon fiber frame and I had a black

43
00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:48.960
water bottle and all the weed bags was in the two water bottles.

44
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:53.490
So it just looked like I was a cyclist out on a motherfucking out on a ride.

45
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.020
Oh Wow.
Hell yeah.
And then they,
uh,
Dave Chappelle,

46
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.750
we didn't,
he blew up.
So fairs,
Mannheim was the guy's name.

47
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:04.540
He was the publicist there at Tristar pitches.

48
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.040
And then I delivered to him at the Boston comedy club and we didn't,
like months,

49
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:14.041
he was living in some police show fucking spot on like second avenue and 15th in

50
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:18.130
the,
and I might go,

He just.
