WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.640
The joe rogan experience and they got imprisoned and they had a lot of

2
00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:07.500
resentment towards Kennedy.
I mean,

3
00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:12.420
I go into the book though a little bit about the Kennedy assassination and the

4
00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:14.250
belief that a lot of that,

5
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:17.880
a handful of those Cubans may have been involved in the Kennedy assassination

6
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:22.881
along with the Italians with the mob because they were working hand in hand with

7
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.870
the CIA.
Yeah.

8
00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:29.871
That was one of the leading conspiracies outside of the CIA killing him and even

9
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:34.650
the CIA killing him was a part of the bay of the Bay of pigs conspiracy.
Yeah,

10
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.890
and also the,
the idea that he wanted to disband the CIA.

11
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:40.680
There was a really interesting article recently and there was dismissing almost

12
00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:45.570
every single conspiracy theory about the Kennedy assassination.
They said,

13
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.250
except the CIA one,

14
00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:51.510
there's legitimate possibilities that the CIA,
well,

15
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:56.511
you can bet your ass that if the CIA was involved in Cubans or some in the book

16
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.640
you speak about Fidel's mistress.
Yeah.

17
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.620
That he got this one too with her at this particular one Margarita.

18
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.470
She had gone to New Orleans.
Yeah.
Or The Dallas.
My retail.
Lorena,

19
00:01:09.471 --> 00:01:11.290
this is very interesting.
The tortillas figure.

20
00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:15.720
She had a child with him and had an abortion and didn't have the child.

21
00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:19.110
She got pregnant with fidelity.
In fact,
Castro,
we admitted as much.

22
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:20.970
She got pregnant with Castro.
She had,

23
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.420
she had an abortion and then the CIA used her to try to assassinate Castro.

24
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.790
Um,
she had was supposed to slip him a pill and she put it in her,

25
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.023
um,

26
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.300
face cream and the pill dissolved in her face cream and that was the pill she

27
00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:42.000
was going to try to slip to Castro.
Her,

28
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.160
her case agent was a guy named Frank Sturgis who wound up being one of the

29
00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:51.540
Watergate burglars.
See the thing about Bay of Pigs and the Cubans,

30
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.820
uh,
the Bay of Pigs invasion is the key to understanding the whole ladder part of

31
00:01:56.821 --> 00:02:00.690
the 20th century politics in the United States.

32
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.690
The Cold War because the alliance between the CIA and the Cubans rears its head

33
00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:10.680
constantly throughout the latter part of the 20th century.

34
00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:14.460
The Watergate burglary,
five out of seven of the burglars were Cubans,

35
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.200
Bay of pigs veterans.

36
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.210
They had been recruited by a guy named he Howard Hunt Cih and who is one of the

37
00:02:21.211 --> 00:02:25.110
orchestrators of the Bay of Pigs invasion was also one of the people that on his

38
00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:29.220
deathbed said that he was involved in the assassination of Kennedy.
Yes.
This,

39
00:02:29.221 --> 00:02:33.180
so the CIA would come to these Cuban exiles,
the militant exiles,
and they'd say,

40
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.500
go to this operation,
go do this burglary at the,
at the Watergate.

41
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.630
And then we go get Fidel,
go do this assassination.
And then we go get Fidel.

42
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.070
And the Cubans were always ready and willing because it was all leading back to

43
00:02:47.071 --> 00:02:51.000
getting,
it was all leading back to,
did you ever see the images of a,

44
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:54.030
what they said was he Howard hunt?
It was one of the people that was arrested.

45
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.060
There was a series of,
um,
uh,
there was a bunch of guys that were arrested,
uh,

46
00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.410
that were on trains that were calling them.
Hobos were all very well dressed.

47
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:07.200
Right.
That were near where the grassy knoll woman on the grass and all,
yeah.
Oh,

48
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.870
there's lots of rumors about that,
that he,
Howard hunt was one of those men.

49
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.430
There was even a reference that Jose Miguel battle was one of those men,

50
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:19.450
but that couldn't have been the case because he was in the army at the time.
Uh,

51
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.620
the U s army,
um,
no,
so,
so it's like a,

52
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.630
it's like a subterranean narrative that runs through the latter part of the 20th

53
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:29.464
century,

54
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.850
the CIA and right wing elements in American politics using the Cuban Americans

55
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:39.400
to do all kinds of dirty covert deeds.

56
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.250
And we're talking about terrorist activity.
Uh,

57
00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.890
assassination of an ambassador from Chile,

58
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:49.891
right in Washington DC blew up his car cause he was sympathetic to Castro,

59
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.940
a bomb planted on a Cuban,

60
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.360
a jetliner flying from Panama City to advantage 73 people killed innocent

61
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.050
people,
including the fencing team from Cuba,
young people,

62
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.490
a dirty war,

63
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.350
a dirty war was waged by the anti-castro underground,

64
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.100
uh,
in combination in partnership with the CIA.

65
00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:16.810
And we know about it now because a lot of it has been declassified and it's come

66
00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:20.230
out,
we didn't know about it at the time it was taking place.

67
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.180
Why they blow up the plane.
Just an act of terrorism against Cuba to,

68
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:26.720
uh,
to,
uh,

69
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.480
show them that it could be done to instill fear and paranoia in the queue.
The,

70
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.920
the concept was to destabilize the Cuban government so they'd be vulnerable and

71
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:40.300
then you could take them over.
So any,
any act against Cuba.

72
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.480
I mean,
asking why blowing up the plane wood is asking like,

73
00:04:43.481 --> 00:04:47.050
why fly planes into the World Trade Center?
You know,

74
00:04:47.051 --> 00:04:49.300
it was just a destructive act.

75
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.290
It's pretty amazing how resilient Castro was.
I mean,
unbelievable.

76
00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:57.910
The guy's 90 miles away from Miami and just ran shit through the 60s,

77
00:04:57.911 --> 00:04:59.260
the 70s,
the 80s,

78
00:04:59.261 --> 00:05:04.261
the 90s and to the 2000 they say there was something like 632 known plots over

79
00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:10.600
over the course of four or five decades to kill Castro.
Incredible.

80
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.610
632 that seemed to happen.
It'll be 101 ways to kill Fidel.
Yeah.

81
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.360
And he went to,
he got a little train in New York and they're like,

82
00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:22.650
are you fucking crazy?
And they checked to see the other bulletproof vest on.

83
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.770
He's like,
no,
he took the train to the UN.
Wow.

84
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.390
Like he's fucking nuts.
Yeah.
He was fucking nuts.
So,
so,

85
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.670
um,
what makes this,

86
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.590
this gangster story of the corporation so interesting and different is this

87
00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:39.850
political context,

88
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.090
the framework that all this shit was taking place against the backdrop of this

89
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.860
desire to kill Castro and take back,

90
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.660
take back the homeland and anyone who was involved in that was seen as a hero

91
00:05:52.661 --> 00:05:56.470
within the community.
Joey can tell you about that.
Union city,

92
00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.250
New Jersey and Miami where the hot beds of the anti-castro movement there were,

93
00:06:01.251 --> 00:06:05.510
where it was an organization and union city called Omega seven and there was one

94
00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:10.460
in Miami called Alpha 66.
These were terror organizations,

95
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.600
secret organizations that existed to plant bombs.

96
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.130
They would plant bombs at embassies in the United,
you know,
in New York City.

97
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.510
They would put,
they would put bombs at Lincoln Center when a,
when a,

98
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.050
when an orchestra from Cuba was making an appearance,

99
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:32.260
they were trying to shut down any relationship between the US and Cuba and

100
00:06:34.071 --> 00:06:36.440
governments that were sympathetic to Cuba.
They would,

101
00:06:36.441 --> 00:06:40.100
they would do actions against them.
And this went on for like 40 years.
Man,

102
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.221
that's unbelievable.

103
00:06:41.221 --> 00:06:45.650
You couldn't mention for dome the Seventies in Union city like a joke.

104
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.620
Like it's not a joke.
Don't even,
don't even know.
Don't even bring them up dog,

105
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:50.510
cause you will get smacked.

106
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.730
Now was there any pro Fidel support amongst Cubans?

107
00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.500
There was and bad things would happen to them.
Um,
in the United States,

108
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:05.300
yes.
You Go.
What about in Cuba?
Pro Castro,
India.
Oh yeah,

109
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:10.130
sure.
I mean,
um,
was it real or was it out of fear?
It's real.
It's real.
I mean,

110
00:07:10.131 --> 00:07:14.300
I've been there numerous times.
You know,
the killing people made a choice,

111
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.553
uh,

112
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:20.590
and the revolution I believe would have happened with or without Fidel Castro.

113
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.340
I'm the guy who was in power.

114
00:07:23.341 --> 00:07:27.740
Battista had taken over the government and the coup d'etat,
he wasn't elected,

115
00:07:27.741 --> 00:07:32.030
so he was kind of a fraudulent president.
And there was an,

116
00:07:32.031 --> 00:07:33.230
ever since he got in,

117
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.340
people knew he was a fraudulent president and there was attempts to try to

118
00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.610
foster him.
And that's why he was such a dictator.

119
00:07:40.611 --> 00:07:42.110
He knew they wanted the house to him.

120
00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:47.111
So he used the military to repress any kind of movement against him and it was

121
00:07:48.021 --> 00:07:52.330
ugly and the people rose up against it.
That's what happened.
It wasn't so in,

122
00:07:52.331 --> 00:07:57.260
in my belief,
the revolution in Cuba happened for a very legitimate reason.

123
00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.690
After it happened in power,

124
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:03.740
it was revealed that Castro and Che Guevara were communists.

125
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.030
He Castro was very cagey about that during the revolution.

126
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:12.770
They never talked about Marxism and being communists or any of that.
And in fact,

127
00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:14.510
Fidel came to union city,

128
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:18.800
came to the United States to raise money for the revolution while it was going

129
00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:23.150
on.
Got Arrested in union city.
My friend's mom,

130
00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.760
the escalate,
he says,
she says,

131
00:08:25.761 --> 00:08:29.890
she still remembers taking the bus in the morning and union city and Fidelis

132
00:08:29.891 --> 00:08:32.570
talking to her on the way.
I'm talking to you.
How you doing,
Susan?

133
00:08:32.571 --> 00:08:35.610
What's going on?
Wow.
He got in a room,

134
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:40.460
he got in a bar room argument in union city and he got arrested.
Over what,

135
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.360
uh,
probably politics.
I'm sure it was a political discussion.

136
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.130
Um,
so,
so then the,
the revolution happened and,

137
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.350
and you know,
uh,

138
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:56.380
Cuba becomes a repressive communist Stalinist dictatorship,

139
00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.400
but a lot of Cubans,

140
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.780
the way they saw it is that was the choice they made to go with Fidel.

141
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:06.640
He did have a,
I think the,

142
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:10.440
the popularity of the people following of the people.

143
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:15.680
Some people are quite proud of Castro standing up to the United States.

144
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:17.460
Uh,

145
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:21.840
Cubans are very proud people and they take a lot of pride in the fact that even

146
00:09:21.841 --> 00:09:25.410
though there's so much hardship there that um,

147
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.680
it's a choice they made to go in this direction.
At least they have.

148
00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.510
There is self pride,
uh,
which is,
um,

149
00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:37.540
more in the can be said in some ways about Puerto Rico and Jamaica and Dominican

150
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:38.371
Republic.

151
00:09:38.371 --> 00:09:43.371
All these other countries in that region that are just as poor is Cuba.

152
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:48.240
Um,
so he has his supporters.
He always had his support.

153
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:53.500
Obviously.
He also had his detractors even within Cuba.
Um,

154
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.960
most of those people are the ones who got on rafts and tried to leave the island

155
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.090
at great risk to themselves to do anything to get out of there because they

156
00:10:03.091 --> 00:10:06.270
realize Fidel was so popular from within the country.

157
00:10:06.271 --> 00:10:08.760
You are never going to be able to take him down.

158
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.970
So they made the decision to go out in the ocean and try to brave the,

159
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:15.600
the risks of,

160
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.950
of either swimming or sailing across the Florida Strait.

161
00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:30.010
<v 1>Yeah.</v>
