Her low freak bitches.
So it's got to be very difficult when you're in business.

2
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:07.230
When someone like that,
especially like an executive,

3
00:00:07.231 --> 00:00:11.910
some slick character in a fine suit to find out exactly what is real motives

4
00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:13.950
really are the never been fond suits.

5
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.690
Never know how they dress in a polling suits.
Really.
Yeah.

6
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.400
I mean business is never encounter each find suits,
no pockets.

7
00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:27.240
Whereas occasionally you find a t token pocket square,

8
00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:28.740
but you can tell that heart's not in it.

9
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.420
The wife stuck it in there cause she's soul.

10
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.130
Someone on TV that had a bit of razzle dazzle about them and they thought,

11
00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:40.980
oh I and see my old man man,
one of them.
And they sort of stick it in.

12
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:44.040
The old man's be embarrassed about it and trust squeeze out of the way.

13
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.730
Suits are a thing.
The death of the suit,

14
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.880
it was the death of the suit was the present attitude toward Ongo Noah and I'll

15
00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:58.680
go,
oh,
Larry's name.
Yeah.
I won't put a tie on and on.
Don't want us to count.

16
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.530
That's how I feel.
But that's what's happened.

17
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.470
We've been brainwashed to not dress line gentlemen,

18
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.930
but I see a guy like you and I say,
that's appealing.

19
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.410
Like look how you're dressed and you're in a conservative suit.
This is a nice,

20
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.590
like,
I'm sure you could wear any suit you wanted,

21
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.670
but you chose assert that has a certain look to it.
Yeah.

22
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.310
I have spent some time asking around with this Joe,

23
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.440
but a bit like the same reason that we've spent,
uh,

24
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.250
Tom asking around with a pocket square.
It's,

25
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.400
I remember thinking how much I found the suit repugnant and I became angry that

26
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:34.290
the suit would be robbed from us.

27
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.250
And so I had to create an alibi,

28
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.640
a way in to understand why is that I'd like to suit this was the magic of Ralph

29
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.960
Lorenz,
the magic of Ralph Lauren,
Nice Jewish boy from New York called Lipschitz,

30
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.330
created a waspy empire.
There's a wonderful expression that,
you know,

31
00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:54.991
think Yiddish,

32
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:59.991
dress British and Ralph Lauren created this great empire and resold the waspy

33
00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:05.390
world back to the waspy world.
Oh,
you actually not to the waspy.
Well,

34
00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:10.391
because in England there was a sort of resentment about Savile row traditional

35
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:14.760
tailoring because it'd been robbed from them.
The officers that come along,

36
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.040
the number crunches had come along and there was no creativity in the suit.

37
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.630
A suit needs to be creative.
The person that puts it on calm be putting it on,

38
00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:28.900
but because he's told to put it on,
he's got a one or put it on.
Uh,

39
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.610
so what Ralph did is he fashioned up,

40
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:37.410
they're sort of [inaudible] new England world and soul.
He took on a trip,

41
00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:41.820
he took on a cliche and he refashioned Ackley Shea to give it a new sense of

42
00:02:41.821 --> 00:02:43.920
life,
a new sense of breadth.

43
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.580
He'd put black people in the suits where traditionally it was just a white man

44
00:02:47.581 --> 00:02:52.290
suit.
He made it feel new.
We gave it a take.
So what he did is he tipped his hat,

45
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.990
the old world,
but also tipped his hat and the new world,

46
00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.440
and it allowed wasps to find their way back into the world with an eloquent

47
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:02.560
narrative.
It was clever.

48
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.093
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

49
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.840
[inaudible]
okay.
