WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.060
Exists.
It either works or it doesn't.

2
00:00:03.061 --> 00:00:05.050
It really depends upon how much time and effort you,

3
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.420
you take working on yourself,
your act,
your perspective,

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.520
the way you deliver it.
We always had to win in Van Halen.
We had no choice.

5
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.430
We had to win the battle of the bands.
It was competitive.

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.080
We had to win over the club owner.
This was before there were dance system.

7
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:26.430
Cerwin Vega hadn't been,
hadn't figured out those base bins yet.

8
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.880
You had to have a live band,
five 45 minutes,
such a night place.

9
00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:33.930
Was he a motherfucker closer song where you knew a band couldn't go on?

10
00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:38.550
I have to.
You look the Grinch?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

11
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.440
Uh,
we were pretty good at anything.
We had no development phase.
Mm.

12
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.730
Um,

13
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.410
I have tapes of us at the Hilton Hotel in Pasadena in 1973.

14
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.770
You would if I didn't tell Ya,
you know,
wouldn't,

15
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.160
you wouldn't think it was three years ago.
Kind of a sound.

16
00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:59.700
There's virtually no development.
How'd that happen?
How did it work that way?

17
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.640
We had classical training.
Ah,
right.

18
00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:07.380
And this kind of speaks to what we were discussing earlier in that a lot of my

19
00:01:07.381 --> 00:01:12.381
colleagues are having a great time making music and they celebrate and it's uh,

20
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.500
the word fun comes into it.

21
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.000
And we grew up in classical music backgrounds where you had to challenge for

22
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:23.730
first chair saxophone every six,

23
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.700
eight months you gotta go to the conductor and say,
I want for his chair.

24
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.210
And if you're a first chair and he thinks I have a shy,

25
00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:34.770
he's going to come over to Joyce's Roth's talking bout you.
Oh,
you both,

26
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.400
you both get to play this piece front of the orchestra next Wednesday.

27
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.430
You best practice.
Ah,
okay.

28
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.850
And we'll both get up and we'll both play 18 bars of the same piece and there

29
00:01:47.971 --> 00:01:50.970
just may be a switch in front of 120 people,

30
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.670
all of them colleagues.
All right.
We learned from the music school,

31
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.120
you know,
the racy stuff was big band.
All right.

32
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.010
If you're in terms of,
you know,
uh,

33
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.560
we played rocket role in parallel,
but big band,

34
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.930
it's got a square vibe to it because it wound up in elevators in restaurants and

35
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.080
whatever.
But they had cut and contests and there was nothing more cut.

36
00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:20.310
And then Benny Goodman versus chick Webb,
big band at Roseland ballroom,

37
00:02:20.311 --> 00:02:25.230
that shit is on.
People would bet on it.
They would play the same four songs.

38
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.340
You play your version of it and we'll play ours.

39
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.520
Wow.
Yeah.

40
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.690
Wow.
Throw down a big Pan,
throw down.
Oh yeah.

41
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.740
And it was furious shit too.
You know,
it wasn't like friendly.

42
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.820
They would say dancers would stand in the middle of those sparks and that's

43
00:02:47.821 --> 00:02:49.920
where you get that.
Yeah.

44
00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:54.300
He's postures that stuff like this.
Okay.

45
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.250
And the dancers were competing.
The Lindy hoppers could be,
wow,
Frankie,

46
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.970
you know,
all these guys throw it.
Um,

47
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.850
so it was competitive and we learn that's how you do it.

48
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.320
You know,
my two mentors in,
um,
uh,

49
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.010
music or,
uh,
first and second chair clarinet,

50
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.420
the La Philharmonic,
and he comes from that

51
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.810
also.
You know,
you have a whole different vibe that,
uh,

52
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.490
I'll take a grateful dead approach,

53
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.650
which is the complete opposite of that competition,
man.
Leave that at home.

54
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.770
Yeah.
You know,
well,
we're here to celebrate and so,

55
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.270
and I completely understand that's where I'll go after work,

56
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.440
take my vest off.
But my goodness,
dad,

57
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.710
he took a totally different turn,
right?
They said,
go ahead,
take all of our shows.

58
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.830
Come on,
you know,
sell food in the parking lot,
man.
We had to,
when we,

59
00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.700
or we didn't eat boxing for money,
it's different than boxing for fun.
Right,

60
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.680
right.
Learn that very early and we learned it through music.
Yeah.

61
00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:07.440
You know,
some of the folks learn it in the rank.

62
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.910
Other folks learn it in their first few days in a law firm or,

63
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.480
and they join a team.
It's interesting the way you described it with music,

64
00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:18.640
because I tried to explain that to comedians.
I say,

65
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:23.260
think about how much time a musician has to spend practicing and how little we

66
00:04:23.261 --> 00:04:27.370
spend practicing.
We are practices in front of the audience.
For the most part,

67
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.390
it's a simplified version of the 10 big apartment.

68
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.930
A simplified version of the how many hours rule is the 10,000 hours you've heard

69
00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:43.900
about it?
Yes.
That's a very simplified version.
Okay.
That's digestible.

70
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.030
10,000 hours.
I don't know.
You break that down.
Was it take a six years,

71
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.320
maybe something like this.

72
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.810
The True Asian paradigm is 10 hours a day.

73
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.390
Every single day for 10 years.

74
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.010
If you have a little,
a little kid and he's got to have heart surgery,

75
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.530
you want that guy,
right?
It's right around 30,000 hours.

76
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.970
If you're going to go flying in a helicopter over New York,
Shitty,

77
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.460
you want Captain Paulie?
Tremonti it's about 40,000 hours.
Okay.

78
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.133
Uh,

79
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.470
my dentist Doctor Glassman who teaches is a 40,000 hour man.

80
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.210
Okay?
Uh,
so if you ever crash or get pelted gimme a call,

81
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.540
I will hook you up.
It's about 30,000 hours in.

82
00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:45.410
That's 10 hours a day.
Every single day for 10 years.

83
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.160
And that's what creates,
uh,
a jet pilot,

84
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.380
a great surgeon,
a great writer,
you know,

85
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.110
anything in the arts and letters.
That's,
that's the architect.

86
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.190
Unless you're out prodigy and g if you bundle that and typing it's tragedy very

87
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:08.210
easily.
So yeah,
prodigies and tragedies often go hand in hand.

88
00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.240
That's something about people that get things very easily that for whatever

89
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:13.610
reason it slips through their fingers more quickly as well.

90
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.990
When my shift and my dad was an eye surgeon,
okay,

91
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.100
did well and uh,
uh,
when my sisters,

92
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.030
uh,
wanting to go to college,
he said,
I think that's a great idea.

93
00:06:26.031 --> 00:06:28.410
And made her pay for it.
Oh,

94
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.810
she wouldn't value it if she didn't pay for it herself.
It's probably right.

95
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.870
I signed my first contract when I was $1,350 stereo and a three records.

96
00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.330
I worked all summer shoveling shit at the local a horse stable.

97
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.190
It's where I learned Spanish.
I don't know that you got it.
Do that.

98
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.170
You learned the same thing from sports.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Your kids do sports.
Yeah.

99
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.750
Which ones?
Um,
martial arts.
And,
uh,

100
00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:01.270
one of them is really into gymnastics.
Yeah.
Yeah.

101
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.170
Are they competitive in it or are they,
do they enjoy themselves?

102
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.740
Are they on team,
like they're unturned tournaments or,

103
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.230
and is that something that
the get go here,

104
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.620
I'll back up.
I'm leading up to something.
Can you guess?

105
00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:19.930
I think you always are folks.

106
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.800
Folks are starting to recognize certain traits in me as in I really like the

107
00:07:27.071 --> 00:07:30.460
getting ready more than the actual show.
Really.

108
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:34.630
You actual show I'm making fun here and be a poetic,

109
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.600
the Monitor blows the guitar players pissed

110
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.130
the spotlights on the wrong guy.

111
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:47.250
I have a cold but that six months,
six weeks leading up to it.

112
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:50.190
I remember the rehearsal we did it if it's thing and hey,

113
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:53.680
when we recorded the track over that they remember when we got measured for the

114
00:07:53.681 --> 00:07:58.060
shoes that fucking oh it was great and it's,
where did we eat after that?

115
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:01.330
I got to go back there and Andy,
Andy,
Andy.
Yeah.

116
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:06.630
I always sought to make those rehearsals and whatever as memorable as possible

117
00:08:07.181 --> 00:08:09.610
because you didn't do a whole lot more.
I getting ready.

118
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:15.100
Then Yara throwing the punch.
Yeah.
Ask anybody on one of your shows.
Yes.

119
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.840
Yeah.
Yeah.
You have such a great insight for that though.

120
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.110
You know,
some people,
they eat meat.
Even if they're aware of it,

121
00:08:23.111 --> 00:08:27.070
they're not consciously aware of it.
They're not focusing on all these details.

122
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:28.990
The getting ready.

123
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.090
He's as much of a,

124
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:39.360
if the band says they don't like rehearsing,
you're doing it wrong.
Hey Man.

125
00:08:39.361 --> 00:08:41.610
It's like if you're sitting on your laurels,

126
00:08:41.611 --> 00:08:43.350
you're wearing them on the wrong part of your body.

127
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.460
First off,
where are you rehearsing?
Right?
As in Miami?

128
00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:58.020
No.
Where are you training?

129
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.960
Hawaii.
Cleveland.
Okay.
Let's talk,

130
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:07.500
because even in Cleveland,
you can turn it into your place.

131
00:09:07.501 --> 00:09:11.790
Do you follow?
What is your routine you follow?
What music did you listen to?

132
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.840
You dig?
How did you warm up?
Simple,
simple things.
You know,

133
00:09:15.841 --> 00:09:20.700
most people are feared,
terrified of singing when they go in to sing it.

134
00:09:20.701 --> 00:09:22.530
Now I don't care who it is.

135
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:27.540
The first verse is always a little tight.
In the second verse is a little better.

136
00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:31.110
Why?
Because they didn't warm up.
Right.
All right.

137
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:36.350
And the idea of we'll go in and sing along with a dozen of your favorite songs,

138
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:43.410
puts your head gear on,
get the reverb to Santa for me.
That starts with Motown.

139
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:48.270
I'm a sole growler.
I'm the,
I'm closer to Wilson picket.

140
00:09:48.271 --> 00:09:51.510
Then the guy in the rolling stones,
that was loud.

141
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:57.310
I don't know what that sounds like on the headphones.
You know,
that's,

142
00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.620
I spent many.
I'm going to put the headphones on here.
There we go.

143
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.370
Now Babe.
Yeah,
that's right.

144
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:09.300
I started sounding like that when I was 12.

145
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.530
I started practicing that when I was 12.

146
00:10:13.531 --> 00:10:18.420
I started imitating the persuasions,
Jerry Butler to singer.
Um,

147
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.920
let us 13,
much to the cantors,

148
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:27.120
Chagrin in Hebrew school.
Okay.
Again,

149
00:10:27.121 --> 00:10:31.680
parallel existences.
You know,
I'm Jewish,

150
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.730
but we always walked around with little buttons back then and said,
never again.

151
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.110
I'm a combat hippie.
Peace,
love,
and heavy weapons.

152
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.920
Some people don't believe you.
Sometimes you got to get insistent.
