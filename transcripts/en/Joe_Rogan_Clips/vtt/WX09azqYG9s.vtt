00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.470
Hello Freak bitches,
boom.
And we're live.

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.560
Let's have a toast to Hugh Hefner.
Yes.

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.890
We lost one of the Great Dick slingers of the 20th century.

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.600
Certainly did in last time.

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.740
He literally had a place where guys could go to be leches.
Yeah,

6
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.990
you could just go and you had a mansion where everybody knew there was going to

7
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:24.360
be a bunch of hose.
That's why they went.
Yeah,
they,

8
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.080
they went there on purpose and there was guys that like were notorious for

9
00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:32.250
hanging around the mansion for going to all imagine parties.
Did you ever go?

10
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.320
I went twice.
I went once for a marijuana policy project,
um,

11
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.530
thing.
I think that was a company that was putting it together.

12
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.610
A or a hosted something and there's bands and stuff like that was kind of

13
00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:48.270
interesting.
That's fun.
And then the other time I went was for fear factor.

14
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.570
We did some thing for fear factor with the playboy playmates.

15
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.280
Do you have to meet?
He'll,
I never met a man.
No,
never met him.
And he's just,

16
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.260
I think at,
by that time he's,
he's old and I think he just wants to chill.

17
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.460
Yeah.
He was just kind of done.
I never went there.
I tried to get in,

18
00:01:04.461 --> 00:01:07.680
a girl tried to get me in and I guess they,
they googled me and she goes,

19
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.490
I guess I didn't have enough credits.
Oh,
come on,
sit.
What?
What was,

20
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.130
I couldn't get in.
And she's like,
yeah,
they have to look you up.
And she was nice,

21
00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:18.090
but they said no.
How long ago was this?
Probably two years ago.
Oh my God.
I know.

22
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.000
I didn't qualify to go.
Like,

23
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.140
I didn't qualify to go with his fucking girls and fucking test.
So crazy.

24
00:01:25.141 --> 00:01:27.150
You didn't have enough credits,
I guess,

25
00:01:27.151 --> 00:01:29.790
sell it or maybe they didn't have the right credits or maybe they just didn't

26
00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:32.010
care,
like whatever.
You know what I mean?
I didn't,
I wasn't even that mad,

27
00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:36.720
but I was like,
Eh,
whatever.
Credits.
Oh,
gross.
Yeah.

28
00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:39.510
She said something like that.
But uh,
she was trying to be really nice.

29
00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:41.700
Like she was trying to let me down easy because she felt bad because we were

30
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:43.410
friends and she wanted to go,
like,

31
00:01:43.411 --> 00:01:46.290
you just don't qualify to come here and look at these tits.

32
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.330
I was just really hurtful.
It was a weird place because it was super outdated.

33
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.880
Like you heard about the grotto,
the grotto,

34
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:57.360
you go to the grotto and has a phone from like the 1970s there and you're like,

35
00:01:57.361 --> 00:01:59.640
what is this?
They left it like for apply for the vibe.

36
00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:03.480
The old school vibe I guess.
Or they just never updated it because we're like,

37
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.590
you know,
he's sold the place or it was for sale.

38
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.770
But one of the caveats of purchase was that he had to live in the building until

39
00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:17.760
he died.
Yeah.
Yup.
But it was like some preposterous amount of money.

40
00:02:17.761 --> 00:02:21.780
Like $200 million or something crazy.
Well,
the land is really valuable.

41
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.450
So what do they do with that now?
Do they knock it down?

42
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.190
I mean he's there no nostalgia to it.

43
00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:29.950
Is it like kind of died on the vine anyway or do you fucking what he did?
Well,

44
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.750
he has a son and his son probably inherited it.
His son,

45
00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:38.370
I think was running the magazine.
They tried for a to have no nudity.
Oh,

46
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.920
terrible idea.
It's like fucking,

47
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.100
it's like my mechanic fucking thing with no cars in it.

48
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.200
Who wants to just read that shit stupid.

49
00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:50.670
It's like having a New York Times article with all ads.
Like what do you,

50
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.390
where's the fucking intellectual stimulation here?
And you fucking idiots.

51
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.710
That's a really bad,
no,
nudity is a terrible decision.
Well,

52
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.840
they were always in this weird area,
right?

53
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.840
Because [inaudible] was like the only acceptable pornographer like Larry Flynt

54
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.000
who did a lot for free speech,

55
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.030
who did a lot for exposing corrupt politicians,

56
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.110
but they would show vaginas and assholes.
Yeah.
And because of that,

57
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:21.550
he was always thought as a gross guy.
Yeah.
Well even their social commentary.

58
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.420
I remember when I was a kid,
it was one,
it might,
who is the feminist?
Uh,
Gloria.

59
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.760
Uh,
oh no,
no.
Gloria Allred on my guide,

60
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.180
and I think it was a Gloria Steinem parody,
but it was like,
you know,

61
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:33.070
her licking the girl's pussy,
that head period blood.

62
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:37.120
It was like some fucking vile thing.

63
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.070
He would do the most vile political colic.

64
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.590
He really showed his disdain of those people.
He was great.
He's a crazy guy.

65
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:48.140
He's still alive.
That fucker.
Yeah.
It's shot,
you know,

66
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.950
and paralyzed like way back in the day,
right?
Yeah.

67
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.600
77 maybe it was that late at night.
I think it was I that were 76.
Yeah.
Yeah.

68
00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:57.820
He's getting,
it's still got a bunch of casinos and stuff.

69
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.040
He's still out there kicking it,
but like,
who the hell is buying hustler?
Um,
well,

70
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:05.620
it's funny you mentioned I had my manager got one today.

71
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:07.600
I haven't bought one in many years because there's a,

72
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:09.600
I did an interview for them and,
uh,

73
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.280
it was actually a really good interview and they quoted me accurately show I'm

74
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:14.920
in December's hustling,
which is out today.
Wow.

75
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.360
<v 1>Yeah.</v>
