WEBVTT

1
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.730
Ooh,
it's so good though.
It is good.
It's smooth.

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.100
I like the cinnamon too.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

3
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.810
And it's in a party drink for real tequila enthusiasts though.

4
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.350
Is that like sacrilege?
Is that like an electric Mustang?
Oh yeah.

5
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.120
But that's what the monkey has always done.
Yeah.
You know,

6
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.580
it's like playing the golf thing outside of the launch gas monkey golf apparel

7
00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:31.260
line.
And so I'll be wearing a golf shirt out there and it's,
it's pretty crazy.

8
00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:34.380
It's a got a skull and all kinds of crap or whatever.
But uh,

9
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.480
whether I'm pushing the envelope as the monkey is,

10
00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:39.540
our tagline is snap and teas and fill in holes.

11
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.750
Now when you bring that to the country club to people say,
sir,

12
00:00:45.751 --> 00:00:49.710
that attire is unforgivable here.
Oh yeah.
For sure.

13
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.980
I've been thrown out of my own country club plenty of times and I've bought a

14
00:00:52.981 --> 00:00:56.880
lot of golf carts cause I've crashed him cause I thought it was fun and it got

15
00:00:56.881 --> 00:01:00.750
thrown out of your own country club a bunch of time.
Really?
For what?

16
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.770
Just raising too much.
Hell it,
you know,
I'm the,

17
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.710
it almost like the old Rodney daydreaming movies,
you know,
it's like,
sorry,

18
00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:10.560
you can't do that in here.
And I was like,
well,
I'm going to do it twice.

19
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.580
Caddyshack all time.
Exactly.
Yeah.

20
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.420
Now what did they say to you?
Uh,
just,
you know,

21
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.350
they usually just take me home because you know,
live on the course,

22
00:01:21.351 --> 00:01:25.650
so they'll drive me down there.
You have a house on the course?
I did.

23
00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:28.430
I lived downtown in Dallas now,
but,
uh,
uh,

24
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.850
the worst one was I decided to drop my Harley home on the golf course.

25
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.030
One nine agreements.
I stayed to the cart path.
I'm not a complete asshole,
but,
uh,

26
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.700
I did drive it home at about one 30 or two in the morning and my house is

27
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:44.340
probably the furthest house from the clubhouse.

28
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.970
And that thing is freaking loud when you're in that,
you know,

29
00:01:47.971 --> 00:01:52.200
this trench of a golf course.
Right.
The cops were waiting on me when I got home,

30
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.460
but thank God they were in the cops.
I was like,
you can't do anything.

31
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.280
I'm going inside fake golf course cops.
Yeah.
You know,

32
00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:02.820
the community cops community cobb's that's adorable.

33
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.640
I had a good one for you actually got arrested at this country club.

34
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.890
Well at my house for,

35
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.590
I wouldn't say arrested because they ended up letting me go,

36
00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:14.780
but they did come cuff me and put me away.
Um,
the,
um,

37
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.780
we're coming home from Christmas extravaganza,

38
00:02:18.781 --> 00:02:20.010
which I do with my buddies every year.

39
00:02:20.011 --> 00:02:24.180
Right before Christmas we get a big garden pile in and we go Christmas shopping

40
00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:27.600
for our families.
And what have you coming home loaded?

41
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.800
I supposedly threw a burrito from taco bell or something and hit the guard.

42
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.430
So there's four,
three or four of my buddies.
We get to my house,

43
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.200
we pig out on Shitty Taco bell food,
you know,
until everybody passes out.

44
00:02:43.201 --> 00:02:46.470
And the next thing I know the cop lights are,
aren't banging on the door.

45
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.100
Get out of here.
I'm,
I come to the door going,
hey,
why,
you know,

46
00:02:50.101 --> 00:02:53.610
after you've been drinking and he'd do a bunch of have food,
you're fucking gone.

47
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.690
And,
uh,
so long story short,
they said,
well,

48
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.600
you're going to be arrested for assault.
If you look,
go ahead and uh,

49
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.670
say you're sorry to this guy saw it with a burrito.
Correct.
Right.
And by the,

50
00:03:04.671 --> 00:03:08.860
and so if you charge a man with a salt,
because he throws a Burrito at you,

51
00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:12.670
you should,
you should turn in your card.
But we,
we watch the tape.

52
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.110
It was not like throwing it at him.

53
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:16.360
It's not like I've barely with a baseball right here.

54
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.890
I like chunked it to him to eat.

55
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:21.530
But he didn't see it coming until it like slapped him and fell down.
So they,

56
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.760
they cuffed me,
they take me down to the guard house.
Yeah,

57
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.020
they put me in the back of the cop car.
Kofi cops.
No,
these are real.

58
00:03:28.021 --> 00:03:30.740
It's a real cop.
He filed a report and a,

59
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.650
so this is how stupid it gets by then.
I'm so fricking loaded.

60
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:38.740
Right.
And I get there and the Burrito is still on the ground,

61
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:41.440
like it's evidence or some shit.
And they're telling me,

62
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:43.900
I got to apologize to this guy and all I can focus on this.

63
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.850
There's a perfectly good fucking burrito around here.

64
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:47.980
I'm going to eat this burrito.

65
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.600
So I sit down and literally start eating the Burrito God and you're like,

66
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.990
please just tell him you're sorry so can go back home.
And I'm like,
okay.

67
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.330
So I tell him,
I'm sorry,
I'm still eating a burrito.

68
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.200
And they just left me there like a mile from my house at the guard shack.

69
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.540
You walked home with mile drunk.

70
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.500
See The guy since then?
Oh Gosh.
Now I was like,
dude,
that was perfectly,

71
00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:14.800
I mean back,
this was in the days before.
The sprinters are so popular,

72
00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:16.600
so it was like a stretch limo,
which is,
you know,

73
00:04:16.601 --> 00:04:20.590
you just really don't ride it anymore.
And I was like,
that's a hell of a shot.

74
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.490
Came out of the back window 120 inches up to the front,
hit the gas,

75
00:04:24.491 --> 00:04:28.910
cleared the fucking chest.
I should get a medal for that.
Assault.

76
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.140
Might be a plus in here.

77
00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:35.500
Assault with a Burrito is probably the first time that we've had that are here

78
00:04:35.501 --> 00:04:39.430
and you're a little a podcast room.
I definitely think it's the first time.

79
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.280
It seems like you'd just be able to say,
Hey,

80
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.790
I just threw it to you because I was drunk.
I thought you were hungry.

81
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.500
This is really what it was.
There's one,

82
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.150
I mean you can hear me on the video going,
hey,
you want a burrito?
And uh,

83
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.710
it,
it was pretty ridiculous.
The guy got his man card Yang for sure.
Yeah.

84
00:04:56.711 --> 00:04:59.200
What someone calls a salt.
Like how dare you.

85
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.260
Some people get beaten to a pulp and you call them a Taco Bell Burrito flying

86
00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:06.460
your way.
That thing costs a dollar 99 dude

87
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:09.850
and it's barely meet.

88
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:15.390
We were going over like how much of like there's a ruling on how much meat it

89
00:05:17.411 --> 00:05:20.560
actually has to be,
we can call it a beef Burrito,

90
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.960
but there's fillers in that shit.

91
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.870
Like what is the filler was like silicone or something like that.

92
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.010
But it's something ridiculous.
Like 34% of it is not actually meet.

93
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.520
That's why,
I mean,
that was 10 years ago.
Yeah.

94
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.180
I just don't eat fast food 80% for the internet.

95
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.740
They can pretend it's meat.
Well,
the cool thing,

96
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.940
Taco bell now starting to open all their ones up with bars inside there.
What?

97
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.810
Yeah.
Well that's good for business.
You know,
get people more drunks.

98
00:05:49.811 --> 00:05:51.010
They don't care what the food tastes like.

99
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.860
Actually get them all tanked up feeling some burritos and send them on their
way.
