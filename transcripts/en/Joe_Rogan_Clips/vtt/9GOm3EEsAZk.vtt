1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.830
Be An amazing movie about him.
Oh,
there will be.
Yeah.
And who,
who would play him?

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.440
Um,
good question.
Hopefully not a white man.
Christian Bale.
Uh,

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.310
let him get fat just like he did with Dick Cheney.
We played Dick.

4
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.160
If he could play Dick Cheney,
he can do Trump.
He could play Trump.

5
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.270
He was a great Cheney.
I thought I heard.
I haven't seen him with you yet.

6
00:00:18.271 --> 00:00:21.420
I heard it was amazing.
You know the movie with like a lot of people,

7
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.300
the movie was good.
It was not,
you know,
it's,

8
00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:26.190
I loved like the big short to me was amazing.

9
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.240
I don't think it was as good as that.
But Christian Pale is phenomenal.

10
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.270
He's a phenomenal act.

11
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.400
I mean to gain that much weight to become another person.

12
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.120
That's all thing with Jesse Small at.
It's like they're all,

13
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.820
all these actors are sociopaths.
They're all sociopaths.

14
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.000
Watches Good Morning America interview and try not to laugh.

15
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.600
Well now it's crazy what he said.
He's the gay Tupac.

16
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:53.010
Like you see that what he's saying?
He fought back and great.

17
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:57.540
Those guys like,
oh my gosh,
crisis PR firm is telling them to do that.

18
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.030
The Gay Tupac,
no one's telling them to do that.

19
00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:03.090
This is all so this is Bridget Ferris.
Fetisi said it best.

20
00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:05.550
She says she's hilarious.
She said,

21
00:01:05.551 --> 00:01:08.110
this is what happens when you let actors write the script.
Well,
that's true.

22
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.840
See the plot twist coming a mile away.

23
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.830
I had the other night I was in la in an act was at the table and he was talking

24
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.690
and I'm like,
I don't know who this guy is,

25
00:01:15.691 --> 00:01:18.260
but he's not even the person he is at this table.
Right,
right.

26
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.970
He's trying out a person right now.
Have you ever been in that situation?

27
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.230
I don't know who he is,
but he's not this guy.
He doesn't know who he is either.

28
00:01:28.231 --> 00:01:31.800
He says,
no clue.
It's just good looking guy that vapid.
He's full of nothing.

29
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:36.801
He wants to get famous asap and they say things that other people are saying.

30
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.680
Here's one good to see you.
When they meet you,
they say,

31
00:01:40.681 --> 00:01:43.110
good to see you because they might have met you and they don't want to forget

32
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.860
100% I,
I've said that before,
nice to me.
And they're like,
actually we met before.

33
00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:51.240
I'm like,
fuck.
They'll ask in a very strange way,
they'll be like,

34
00:01:51.241 --> 00:01:54.900
what's going on?
Like,
what's up?
What's going on?
Like you want it,

35
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.480
they want to think you want,
they want,
they want to be fed,

36
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.410
they want to be fed information.
It's like,
what's going on?
And I'm like,
wow,

37
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.070
you know,
a lot of projects he shit bro,

38
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.850
guest spotted flappers lot of things happening and uh,

39
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.930
because you're always trying to move.

40
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.040
That's the thing about La New York is just pound yourself into the ground until

41
00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:16.680
you get funny.
That's kind of what the New York scene,

42
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.640
the New York scene is like two 57 shows a day.

43
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.330
Give up on your life.
Don't speak to your family,

44
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.500
they're losers are holding you back.
Go hard.

45
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.760
La is like,
make a friend,
have lunch,
see what happens.

46
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.000
I talked to some of the people out here and I'm like,
what's the plan?

47
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.200
I get nervous for them.
I'm like,
they're getting high.

48
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:43.800
It's mid day.
I'm like,
okay,
it's Wednesday too.
They're like,

49
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.380
we just had a meeting.
I'm like,
what you do?
They go,

50
00:02:46.381 --> 00:02:48.810
we're talking about starting a podcast.
I'm like,
that's not a meeting.

51
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.600
You're just friends with someone else.
Yeah.

52
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.750
You're talking about stuff that's not a meeting,
but here's the thing.

53
00:02:54.751 --> 00:02:57.390
It does work here and there are people that I know who've made the right friend

54
00:02:57.391 --> 00:03:00.250
and then their life changes.
Yeah,
there's a little of that,

55
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.610
but those people are super transparent and if you don't have any talent that's

56
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:07.120
never going to tell,
never work,
and then everybody resents you.

57
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.760
There's a few of those people that really don't have any talent,

58
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:13.180
but they made the right friends and they cling on to folks and everybody gets

59
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:14.360
real uncomfortable in that.
Went off.
