00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.520
Now,
I mean with what call me is doing and and you know John Jones coming back

2
00:00:03.521 --> 00:00:06.940
dinner,
the lightweights are all moving up to heavyweight.
Do you think,
you know,

3
00:00:06.941 --> 00:00:11.941
gone are the days of the huge dude who was just a physical phenom and now the

4
00:00:12.791 --> 00:00:16.220
smaller technical dues is,
is that there's a thought

5
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.350
<v 1>with the 265 pound weight class and the consensus thought seems to be that</v>

6
00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:25.650
somewhere around 240 pounds is the magic number.

7
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.270
That's what they think.

8
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.220
They think that 240 pounds is the amount of weight that you have where you're

9
00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:35.550
strong enough that you can knock out any man,
right?

10
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.640
But you have more endurance than a man that may be ways to 65 or heavier and

11
00:00:40.951 --> 00:00:44.520
cuts down to two 65 now this is not been substantiated.

12
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.760
The problem is there hasn't been a really super powerful world championship

13
00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:56.310
athlete that weighed 265 pounds.
There's been Brock Lesnar,
but

14
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.300
Brock Lesnar's enhanced.

15
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.200
You're dealing with a guy who tested positive for steroids.

16
00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:07.440
He probably has had things and then this is a new world.

17
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.220
He's also 40 years old now so it's impossible to tell what he would have been

18
00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:13.500
like at 30 if he was clean.

19
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.220
And then you have guys like Francis and Ghana who was 265 pounds,

20
00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:18.720
massive knockout artists,

21
00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:23.220
natural 265 pounds but doesn't have the wrestling base,

22
00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:26.430
got exposed in his fight with Steve Bay meo chick and you can't knock you out.

23
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.310
He's kind of doomed any tired out after the first round.
Okay,
so the,

24
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.160
it's hard to say cause there's never been a 265 pound version of Cain Velasquez,

25
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.480
Cain Velasquez.

26
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.980
My humble opinion when I look at all of the different heavyweights that I've

27
00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:44.010
personally seen,
fight cane stands out as the best.

28
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.940
The reason why Keynes stands out as the best is because he has super human

29
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:51.480
endurance and his ability to put a pace on guys.

30
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.560
You would see these guys just wilt under the pressure of,

31
00:01:55.561 --> 00:02:00.561
and I think with Cain and this is where it gets really interesting what did him

32
00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:05.850
in is probably what also brought him to the top is his mental toughness because

33
00:02:05.851 --> 00:02:09.960
his body started breaking down and he started having all these back injuries.

34
00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:13.770
He needed back surgery,
multiple back surgeries,
shoulder surgery,
knee surgery,

35
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.070
everything was getting fucked up and I think it was getting fucked up cause he

36
00:02:17.071 --> 00:02:21.550
was working through pain and because he has the ability to tolerate pain than

37
00:02:21.551 --> 00:02:25.380
most people don't have and he's just a fucking animal.

38
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.680
But that's also probably what led to him having this insane endurance is the

39
00:02:31.591 --> 00:02:33.090
same kind of mental toughness.

40
00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:36.090
I'm sure there's some genetic advantages as well because they would talk about

41
00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:39.180
how he would take months off and come back in and still fuck everybody up

42
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.270
because he's just that good.
But that also could be attributed to the,

43
00:02:43.271 --> 00:02:47.400
the cardio base that he had from competing for many,
many,
many,

44
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:51.960
many years at a high level and being known for that insane endurance

45
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.110
<v 0>and perception to fatigue.
Going back to what you said,</v>

46
00:02:54.111 --> 00:02:57.610
if you could quantify that,
you'd put cane up there with one of those people.
Yes.

47
00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.680
He has that in abundance.
Yeah.
