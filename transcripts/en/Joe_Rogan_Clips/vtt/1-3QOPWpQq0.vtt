00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.350
The joe rogan experience,
you know,
it's like,
well,
it is weird.
San Francisco.

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.060
Why is San Francisco so empty in Poland?

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.200
There was nobody alive back down people.
There was no tech company.

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.890
There's very few people.
Chat traffic was nothing back then,

5
00:00:15.891 --> 00:00:18.750
but talk to somebody about what traffic is like in 1960 in la.

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.570
I just brought that up earlier,
this show.
Well,

7
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:25.770
I moved here in 94 and I remember when I moved here,
it was nothing like this.

8
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.620
Nothing.
It's gotten a hundred percent worse.

9
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.020
It's like just twice as many people here.
It is.
What it feels like.
It's so crazy.

10
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.910
You get on the highway on a Saturday night just heading into la on a Saturday

11
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.630
night and you're stuck in bumper to bumper traffic for no reason.
No one's dead.

12
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.660
There's no accident.
It's just too,
I read,

13
00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:47.700
I'm reading a book right now called traffic.

14
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.070
It's about the science of traffic and it,

15
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.190
they did a study in La and Saturday 2:00 PM traffic is worse than any weekday

16
00:00:55.231 --> 00:00:59.790
rush hour in Los has everybody's out.
Yeah.
Everyone's out doing their shit.
Dude.

17
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.410
You know when you go to another city,

18
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.380
like if you go to a big city like Seattle and you're like,

19
00:01:04.381 --> 00:01:06.780
you're there with them and they complain about the traffic,
you can go,

20
00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:09.750
first of all,
shut the fuck up.
Second of all,

21
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.090
what I'm doing must be wrong then because I'm dealing with way too many people.

22
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.520
You guys have got it right.
This is the right amount.

23
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.140
Like you've got a lot of people and be enough.

24
00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:22.390
Too many people like in a medium size city that's not la.
Yeah,

25
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.250
and then traffic makes sense.
It goes in,
it goes out.
Yeah.

26
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.560
Like here it's just like,
hence the scooter.

27
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.920
You want to get out before it gets all blade runner.
He

28
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.520
is not going to happen.
Well,
you know,

29
00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:38.970
it's like those dudes like Magnus Walker lived in downtown La,

30
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.860
dreadlocks in his garage and his warehouse district.
Those guys like that shit.

31
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.640
Right?
He likes that Shit.
He likes being an urbanite.
I'm super fucked.

32
00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:50.880
I'm in Venice.
When that tsunami comes,
I'm super fall.
Yeah,

33
00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:54.480
you're right on the edge.
It's not good for me not looking good.

34
00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:57.270
All the cars are done.
There's will be on my room APP.

35
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.180
What's the APP that wants to give us access?

36
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.790
The early warning APP says you have 60 seconds for your fucking dead.

37
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.480
Cause that was I had in Hawaii.
Well yeah,
there's a,

38
00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:11.070
there's an app now that's working in California,
but the United,
it's the,

39
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:13.920
you're about to die.
It's,
it's an earthquake's about to hit.

40
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.270
They apparently have it depending upon the magnitude earthquake,

41
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.500
which is really scary because the higher magnitude possibility the more time you

42
00:02:22.501 --> 00:02:24.600
have.
Oh yeah.

43
00:02:24.601 --> 00:02:28.020
They can give you up to a minute to know your Foxville dude.

44
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.730
I'm just thinking what can I,
I'm thinking about one again in a minute.
Nowhere.

45
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.840
Nowhere worth getting.
I can get to like my closet.

46
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.230
Do you have stored food or anything?
I'm embarrassed that I don't,

47
00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:42.240
I have a list of shit I need for a,

48
00:02:42.241 --> 00:02:44.550
probably should probably get for an earthquake.
I don't know.

49
00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:48.660
You must have a whole room of shit in this fucking Palliser.
You're right here.

50
00:02:48.661 --> 00:02:52.140
But here I have meeting here,
but I have,
um,

51
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.090
I do have commercial freezers.
Of course you do with Lpl,
right?
Yeah.

52
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.700
But,
um,
I have,
um,
emergency rations.
Okay.

53
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.230
Have a freeze dried food,
you know,
that could last me a few months.

54
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.120
How would you,
like,
how would you physically get out of the city if you,
Holly,

55
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.220
you would really be fucked,
you said is you just start walking.

56
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.550
What'd you bicycle?
The wheel.
The real fuck would be cars.

57
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.620
There'd be too many cars.

58
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.740
There's way too many cars for you ever see what happened when the hurricanes

59
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.000
were hitting Texas and people tried to escape or Florida like flora the last
one.

60
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.610
You can't go anywhere and they just get stuck on the highway.

61
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.460
You run out of gas and the highways never be scared and desperate.

62
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.570
It's not good in w hurricanes you see common.

63
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.450
This earthquake get 30 seconds,
you know,

64
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.990
I think my scooter is,
is what's going to save me.
It's going to be there.

65
00:03:42.991 --> 00:03:44.660
You're going to go,
you're going to go somewhere.
They're going to eat you.

66
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.150
They're going to get away.
You gotta be with a bunch of survivors.
Yeah.
Yeah.

67
00:03:49.151 --> 00:03:51.880
They're going to hunt you down and put me on a spit.
Yeah.

68
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.190
They're going to keep you alive so they could eat you longer because there's no

69
00:03:54.191 --> 00:03:55.440
refrigerator federation.

70
00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.370
Just going to tie you up and cut off parts of you eat it in front of you and to

71
00:04:00.371 --> 00:04:03.520
come here and bust into this.
Fuck yeah man.
That's the move.
Come here.

72
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.900
We'll help you about this space dude,
who has a float tank.

73
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.210
That is so awesome.
Everybody should have one.
I agree.
I just,
my,

74
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.960
my real concern is the,
just that the mass of humans,

75
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.580
just the sheer number is so insane and I don't think it's,

76
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.390
I don't think it's sustainable like this number of people that are,

77
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.900
there's never been a time ever in human history when we've had masses of people

78
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:35.560
crammed into areas like we have today and not an American.
Our urban areas,

79
00:04:35.561 --> 00:04:39.610
you mean modern America?
Modern Mexico City is like that jammed up.

80
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.050
There's quite a few places that are like the,

81
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.820
the population numbers higher now than it's ever been recorded.
Human history.

82
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.790
And so the population of these cities is higher than it's ever been.

83
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.230
We've never had,
like Matt,

84
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.400
we'd never had 20 million people in a city before in America like we do in La.

85
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.380
What's that?
Jamie states with a smaller population than Los Angeles County.

86
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.360
Is that all of them?
30 something states?
I'm all of them.

87
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.350
Is La County,
20 million people yet it's like 16 something,
right.
I think of it.

88
00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:13.120
This is like on the 10 to 11 million units.
So looking at this,

89
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.901
this map,

90
00:05:13.901 --> 00:05:18.790
and it's one tiny little area of California and it has more people in it.

91
00:05:18.791 --> 00:05:22.720
If it was a state,
then almost every fucking state except Florida,

92
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.200
that and Texas,
Texas,
New York,
Pennsylvania,
Ohio,

93
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:29.610
and given me Illinois,
Illinois.
God Damn.

94
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.730
And then that is just fucking banana is so crazy.
I don't,
is it,

95
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.250
where would you live if he didn't live?
No,
if I didn't live in,
it's not it.
No.
