00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.910
Search nick gear for this go.
Yeah,
brick.

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.310
Especially if it's hot outside,

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.540
which by the way it might get hot here any minute now.

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.590
There is a fucking fire in Ventura and the winds are insane right now in the

5
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:17.610
fire.
V Through Ventura is just tearing things apart.

6
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.070
You've got the alert on my phone in the Uber drive over.

7
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.240
Careful warning.
Warning's bad man.

8
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:28.740
I mean it was bad and it scares the shit out of me because I love kids
somewhere.

9
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.050
Yes,
there's that for sure.
Um,

10
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.550
but what it scares the shit out of me is that in the short term,

11
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.210
I think most people are going to get out of there if they prepare and move

12
00:00:39.211 --> 00:00:43.710
accordingly.
But you gotta you gotta realize what this is like.

13
00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:46.530
This is something that when you get a fire of this size,

14
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.580
it's burned back that up a little bit.
So you get the numbers just in today,

15
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.820
it's burnt 45,000 acres destroyed at least 150 structures and force 20,000

16
00:00:56.191 --> 00:01:01.080
people,
27,000 people to evacuate and they can't stop it.

17
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.820
They don't have enough manpower.
When,

18
00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:07.770
when something is this big and it's this strong and the winds are this fucking

19
00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:10.230
crazy,
you look at how those trees are blown over,

20
00:01:10.231 --> 00:01:13.900
sideways and these fucking houses are up in flames and it's,

21
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.190
how do they even have enough water?
I have no idea.

22
00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:22.191
I Live City Hall just burned down the city hall building and just them putting

23
00:01:23.491 --> 00:01:27.570
the fire out.
Everyone's water went out.
So there's not enough water.

24
00:01:27.571 --> 00:01:31.530
You couldn't turn on your taps because they used it all to put out city hall,
uh,

25
00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:33.630
wonder if there's like a chart where you could see,

26
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.540
we could go back to nine 11 and post nine 11.

27
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.160
How many women got impregnated by firefighters?
Like how many?

28
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.590
Because remember when firefighters,
like after nine 11,

29
00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:45.230
remember they were real heroes.
Yeah.
No.

30
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.430
People have kind of like taking him for granted until they do something to

31
00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:50.760
actually save your house.
I used to do that bit about they've,

32
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.320
after nine 11 firefighters and cops are getting so much hero pussy,

33
00:01:55.321 --> 00:02:00.010
they were launching it like rotted octopus.
Out of,
out of luck.

34
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.580
What do you call those?
Sling shot.
Sling shot struck it.

35
00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:07.230
I'd have to swat him down with tennis rackets.
I had this whole bit about Europe,

36
00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:11.640
pussy,
they,
it's so true,
right?
Yeah.
Not well.

37
00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:13.740
Then the war came and then all the,
that was,

38
00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:17.880
I think the bit was all the troops are getting the hero pussy that nine 11 first

39
00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:21.360
responders use to get,
and now they're just hanging around bars.

40
00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:22.200
Go and remember me.
