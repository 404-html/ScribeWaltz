1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.440
Yeah,
I need levels of [inaudible] 16 fires up there.
It's impossible.

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:05.903
I like both.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.600
I like when fighters are respectful and I like when fighters talk shit.
Yeah,

4
00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:14.100
for sure.
I mean,
I did enjoy,
it was nice to see.
Yeah.
Brian Ortega.
Max Holloway.

5
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.960
They had that nice back and forth where Max,
sorry.
Pardon me.
Brian was,
you know,

6
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:19.471
he's like,
listen,

7
00:00:19.471 --> 00:00:21.990
I hobby well and hobby or over the injuries and all that type of thing.

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.670
That was nice to see.
It's great.

9
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.520
But they both were exuding confidence at the same time.

10
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.770
They were both adamant that we're going to win the fight.
So it wasn't,

11
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.740
they weren't being too overly cordio.
Yes.
You know,
I don't want to see that.

12
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.671
I don't want to,

13
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:38.880
I don't want to see two facts pretending like they were in church or meeting the

14
00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:40.260
fucking president.
Okay.

15
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.720
I want to see two guys that want to rip each other's heads off.

16
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.900
Call me an animal,
call me a Bob [inaudible],
call me whatever you want.

17
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.620
But that's what gets my engine ticking.
Well,

18
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:53.670
even when they were at the final weigh in and they're staring each other down,

19
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.150
like even though it was respectful,
there was a lot of tension.

20
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.790
There's a lot of tension.
You,
you knew how you were talking about as a way in.

21
00:01:00.791 --> 00:01:05.130
Yeah.
I never saw that one when they were at the way in and Max and Brown,

22
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.840
they just stood,
you know,

23
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:09.540
a couple of feet away from each other staring at each other and it was intense.

24
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.860
It was real.
There was a fucking hell of a fight to ballsy shit.

25
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.530
He's incredible.
He really is,
really is.
I mean,

26
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.100
I was kind of,
um,

27
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.720
not concerned and of course were the one who initially throw up the red flag

28
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.100
when you saw,
you just felt like he looked too tired or lazy.

29
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.710
Slurring his words.
He looked,
he looked half asleep.

30
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.050
He looked like he'd just got out of bed.
That's how we looked.

31
00:01:34.051 --> 00:01:38.340
And then he was slurring his words.
And then,
so I just said it,
your care Max,

32
00:01:38.341 --> 00:01:41.370
everything good.
And he's just like,
you know,
yeah,
you were slowing it.

33
00:01:41.371 --> 00:01:42.630
Simple as that.
And I'm like,

34
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.660
and of course UFC tonight you have a production meeting,

35
00:01:45.661 --> 00:01:47.310
we go over the questions we're going to ask.

36
00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:49.590
So you've got them questions there in front of you.
And I thought,

37
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.890
I can't stick to these questions.
I've got to ask this.
Go,
are you okay?
You know,

38
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.420
for you.
I'm glad you did that.
Well,
you know,

39
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.430
I felt bad afterwards because then I heard that the fire was off and then I

40
00:02:01.531 --> 00:02:04.860
thought,
shit,
if I had gone on,
you know,
two days,

41
00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:07.860
three days out from a five I got on fucking UFC tonight,
or whatever,

42
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:09.720
you're doing my obligations as a fire.

43
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.100
And then another fire on the roster is calling me out for an injury and now the

44
00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:17.160
fights off,
I'd would've been pissed off with them.
You know what I mean?

45
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.010
Maybe you know that that's my choice if I want to highlight it.

46
00:02:20.011 --> 00:02:22.770
So I felt a little bad,
but I really respect him.
Max,

47
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:25.910
he sent me a message thanking me,
you know,
he said,
thank you.
He said,
Marty,

48
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.900
you know,
he said,
dad,
I appreciate that.

49
00:02:27.901 --> 00:02:32.820
I needed someone to do that because he knew he was,
he wasn't 100%.
Um,
so yeah.

50
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.811
So anyway,

51
00:02:33.811 --> 00:02:37.320
I was saying that I wasn't fully convinced that he was okay cause it seemed like

52
00:02:37.321 --> 00:02:41.430
he was not an,
are still slow in his words or whatever,
but uh,

53
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.330
kind of a mumbler he's a mumbler.
Yeah.
So am I,
you know,

54
00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:49.050
so he's at the,
he was fine though.
He was more than fine,
dude.

55
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.570
He looked insane.
Insane.

56
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.930
And or take a fire back or take shots third round,

57
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.800
hit him a couple of big shots and then at the end of the third round like this

58
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:03.190
is my,
no,
I saw him.
That's what he told you.
Yeah,
it's crazy.
It's crazy.

59
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:07.540
And Cardio Cardio is incredible to the roof,
you know.
Excellent.

60
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.680
Footwork combinations,
cuts angles.
Well,
weeds,
the fight,
that's the main thing.

61
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:16.030
You know what I mean?
He reads the fight.
So yeah,
he reads the fine and he's,
he's,

62
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:20.530
he's so good at implementing that strategy of like consistent pressure,

63
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.810
constant angles,
switching stances.

64
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.950
And he switched his stamps as flawlessly fights.
Just as good south.

65
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.430
He does Orthodox and he'll switch in the middle of a combination and then turn

66
00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:33.640
corners on.
Absolutely.
That's right.
He's not there to be counted.

67
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.540
Not An amazing man.
Really good.
And when you hit him back,
you let claps.

68
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:39.420
He's like,
yeah,
no,
for sure won't remember.

69
00:03:39.421 --> 00:03:42.520
It gets Ricardo alarmists and he just pointed at the floor.
He's like,
come on,

70
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.200
let's go right here,
the stat and then bang it out.
Soccer.
That was awesome.

71
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.950
He was,
you know,
it's,
it's great to see that he is okay too.

72
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.580
But I'm really happy that you did point that out because there was some issues

73
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:57.860
and I think a lot of that probably had to do,
I'm just speculating,

74
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.580
but probably had to do with that massive weight cut.
I mean,

75
00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:04.540
he was trying to get down really quickly to one 55 which is crazy.
Right?

76
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:08.740
Cause he fights at one 45 he's the champion and even struggling to go down from

77
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.010
him.

78
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.930
He was in the one eighties get down to one 55 quickly to fight the fight because

79
00:04:13.931 --> 00:04:15.870
they offered it to them on last minute.
Sure.
