00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:01.740
Hello

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.300
<v 1>Freak bitches.
It does change.
I mean hate to to say Louis C take game Gamey,</v>

3
00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:11.070
crazy place once it came to having a kid,
which is very odd.
What'd he said?

4
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.160
Ah,
let it change you and I don't know Louis very well.

5
00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:16.380
She just say this too because people,
somebody,

6
00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:19.530
somebody is giving me a hard time about not commenting on it.
And then Mike,

7
00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:23.460
my thought was like,
first of all,
I want to gather my thoughts.
Absolutely.

8
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.570
And second of all,
I don't know him that well.
I don't even have his phone number.

9
00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:29.880
I've never had a phone call conversations with him.

10
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.570
I bet we've exchanged emails maybe three times ever.

11
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.080
And he and I have run into each other at clubs and said,
hi,

12
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.250
we've never gone out and hung out together.
I'm not good friends with them.
Yeah.

13
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.390
So when all this was going down,
it's not like I had information,

14
00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:48.900
like if Joey Diaz did something fucked up and people wanted me to comment,

15
00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:53.370
first of all,
I would never say anything bad no matter what Joey Diaz did.

16
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.900
Sorry.
That's just the way it is.
If there's just no way around.
Yeah.

17
00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.700
<v 0>If you knew he raped someone,
this is horrible.</v>

18
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.920
<v 1>I see.
So sorry that he did that,
but when,
you know,</v>

19
00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:06.750
I mean I would never,

20
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.560
<v 0>I would never throw him under the bus.
You know what I'm saying?</v>

21
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.990
It's like there's bus throwing and then there's bus throwing,

22
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.620
there's a comment after sort of condemning,
condemning it.

23
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.370
And then there's of course like there was a guy who was in that movie baby

24
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:23.160
driver,
um,
and he asks us basic,
no,

25
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:25.830
it was like an eighth lead or something.

26
00:01:25.831 --> 00:01:30.780
And he went on some show and just went off about Kevin.
And so everyone's like,

27
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.620
it was like,
it looked like a way to get attention.
Like,
yeah,
when I was on set,

28
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.650
he didn't seem that cool and it was so much in retrospect.

29
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.770
<v 1>Oh,
but he's not the guy that's on the walking dead,
the punisher guy.</v>

30
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.590
I don't know.
Isn't that him?
I just saw that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

31
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.310
I think it's that guy who's pretty successful.
He's,

32
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.880
he's the new punisher and that net,

33
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.040
<v 0>it just seemed very like bandwagon jumping when the Louis C K thing happened.</v>

34
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.100
I can speak from a perspective of a woman who's seen this kind of stuff.

35
00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:58.370
I don't know.
I brought him up twice at the store.
That's my knowledge of him.

36
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.090
Right.
But you get these emails from like the New York Times or like,
Hey,

37
00:02:02.091 --> 00:02:04.460
if you have anything you want to say or if you know any other things,
I'm like,

38
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.390
I don't,
and I don't want to attach myself.
I don't want to be like,

39
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.750
I didn't want to be part of that story just for the sake of it.
Right,
right.

40
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.160
Cause then you look like a fame whore.

41
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.360
<v 1>Well that's also the problem.
Like you get caught up in something where you,</v>

42
00:02:17.361 --> 00:02:22.361
you become inexorably connected to this awful event and you didn't do anything.

43
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.720
<v 0>Sure.
Yeah.
So Joey didn't do anything.
It was just,</v>

44
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.030
<v 1>it's like an,
and not Joey Joey,
but oddly enough is,</v>

45
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.830
it's crazy as Joey is,
he's a very gentle person.

46
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.150
<v 0>He's a giant,
he's Puerto Rican,
he's Cuban.
Sorry.</v>

47
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.440
Giant Cuban teddy bear.

48
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.860
He is right because he seems so tough and he loves saying Cock sucker.

49
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.340
But he is just,
he's like,
he's just so kind.

50
00:02:46.341 --> 00:02:49.910
And he's got these eyes like a whale,
like they're just ancient and big,

51
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.440
like the Hamill eyelashes.

52
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.670
He's got these like lovely I and you and he smiles at you like a toddler.

53
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.133
I love him.

54
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.020
<v 1>He's the best.</v>

55
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.020
I exchange emails him maybe once every three or four years we've texted each

56
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:08.500
other maybe 10 times ever.
All only phone calls,

57
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.550
calls me every couple of days.
What's up dog soccer?
What are you doing brother?

58
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.090
What's going on?
It's,
he wants to talk to you.
Yeah.
Joey wants to talk to you.

59
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.150
If I have ever text him is because I have to say send an address to him and now

60
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.130
he's got to like put it in his navigation system.
That's it.
He,
he calls you.

61
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.140
He lovely.
Yeah.
He's,
he's a beautiful person.
Yeah,
it's,
and,
and he's,
you know,
he,

62
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.960
he and I were talking about this whole Louis C k thing is,
he was like,
you know,

63
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:35.800
he goes,
you know what's fucking crazy?
He was like,
I held somebody at gunpoint.

64
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.810
He goes,
he goes,
it goes full armed fucking kidnapping.

65
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.460
And everybody's like,
hey,
you were crazy.
But he goes like,

66
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:47.350
this is the kind of thing crazy.

67
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.660
This is the kind of thing that sticks because he did it to one of us,
right?

68
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.670
Like if you in our world like we are all the same.

69
00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.690
We are all the same thing.

70
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.990
I mean there's gonna be some weird pettiness and bullshit and there's going to

71
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:05.710
be some prejudices and it's going to be some individuals that are out
supportive.

72
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.890
But overall amongst the good eggs,

73
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.850
the ones that you and I associate with,
we are all,

74
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.740
we all consider each other the same thing.

75
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.131
<v 0>Could we,
are,</v>

76
00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:19.460
we understand each other's hearts and we know how hard it is and what it's like.

77
00:04:19.461 --> 00:04:22.430
And we all know that it's us.
Even though the audiences are friends,

78
00:04:22.431 --> 00:04:24.560
it's US versus them.
It's the club versus you know,

79
00:04:24.561 --> 00:04:29.240
you're trying to do a job and we know exactly what this very weird job entails

80
00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.900
and we know the way the other person thinks like we have fucked up thoughts.
Yes.

81
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.980
And it's okay to admit these thoughts to each other and it's a very special bond

82
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.230
and you can't just be like,
I'm a comic.
I get it,

83
00:04:39.231 --> 00:04:43.850
like you have to kind of earn it and there's a respect there.
And so it's,

84
00:04:43.851 --> 00:04:47.450
what he did is deplorable and it was with other comics.

85
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.550
And I feel bad because I feel bad because everybody gets so angry at women.

86
00:04:52.551 --> 00:04:53.780
They're like,
why now?
And I'm like,

87
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.750
cause there's safety in numbers and no one would listen before.

88
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.460
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
