00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.190
The most important thing if you can do all those things is that the other guy

2
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:06.510
has to not know what you're doing.

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.120
That was George Saint Pierre is greatest trend.
Correct.

4
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.450
He never knew when he was punching you or he's taking you down and you were

5
00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:16.350
always,
you were always behind.
Koscheck yes.
Jab in the double it.

6
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.830
So fucking good at that here and that and he's not the best wrestler and he's

7
00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:23.820
not the best striker,
but he was the best at figuring out how to do things.

8
00:00:23.821 --> 00:00:27.150
You didn't know what was coming next,
where,
where you were overloaded for Rasa,

9
00:00:27.151 --> 00:00:31.890
hobby and him or a phenomenal combination cause for Ross is so intellectually so

10
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:34.320
smart and he's thinking rationally.
He's not like,

11
00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:36.660
you're going to go in there and you're gonna fuck him up.
None of that.

12
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.660
Some of the problems,
it's all about overloading his mind.

13
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.280
It was all very rational,
very technique based,
very psychology based.

14
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.240
But the reason that what made that GSP so good also is,
um,
he,
you,

15
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.490
you didn't know what he was doing,

16
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:54.600
but he was facing that high level competition to construct Matt Hughes with
Pico.

17
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.880
All these guys.
He goes,
oh,

18
00:00:56.881 --> 00:00:59.700
I don't need to use my restaurant and knocking on with the body shot this guy

19
00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:00.270
with him,
Kraus,

20
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.420
you're going to see the best version of in Pico cause he can't just sit there

21
00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:05.790
and fucking box of them.
You can see his wrestling.

22
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.750
I bet you're going to see some different mix it up.
Cause he's never been pushed.

23
00:01:08.751 --> 00:01:12.800
He's dominating.
Do you remember what John Danner told us the secret to GSPS.

24
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.490
Do you remember that?
Was that when we're eating at that restaurant,
he had hair.

25
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.373
John did.
He goes,

26
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.730
he said the secret to his success is it's super simple.

27
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.800
He's gonna either faint,

28
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.320
he's either going to thank a jab or he's going to actually really jab you or

29
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:34.680
faint take down or actually take,
take you down.

30
00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:37.440
So that was always a faint before everything.
Yeah,
he goes,
he just,

31
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.010
he's always still in fentanyl.
So you never know when that shot's coming.

32
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.860
My Pico de,
well,

33
00:01:43.861 --> 00:01:48.030
there was the whole thing for asa hobbies just so the two of them together

34
00:01:48.031 --> 00:01:51.690
worked so well because they both have a great check of their ego and an

35
00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:55.770
understanding of the consequences and you barely through write his name mark and

36
00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:58.230
they're both really smart and they're both really,

37
00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:00.630
really told me cause he's trying with them all the time.

38
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.580
Said that he's an amazing chess player.
Uh,
George George is an amazing,

39
00:02:05.581 --> 00:02:10.581
so he's really strategic and I feel like he could always find these out empty

40
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.270
where,
where are you?

41
00:02:12.271 --> 00:02:15.080
Where are you had a weakness near them and that's where he was.

42
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.270
Well he was super open minded to men.
I mean,

43
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.630
didn't need like learn back kicked from you are like,
yes,

44
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.340
like he just found easy place.
I felt so embarrassed that I'm,
uh,

45
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.720
I'm like,
I just felt like it was ridiculous that I'm going to show him anything.

46
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.630
There's video on youtube of Joe Rogan,
GSP,

47
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.200
but you know what I fucking kicking lesson.

48
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.410
I knew I wouldn't ever have tried to sell it to him if I didn't have anything.

49
00:02:46.411 --> 00:02:46.990
But when they're,

50
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.770
that came out of that same meeting with Donna her when we were in the restaurant

51
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.230
Donaher her set it up cause he goes,
I'm looking for,

52
00:02:52.231 --> 00:02:56.190
and he told me afterwards that he set me up.
He kinda had heard.
So He's like,

53
00:02:56.191 --> 00:02:59.430
I'm looking for someone to teach GSP how to throw a tuning sidekick.

54
00:02:59.431 --> 00:03:00.510
His technique is off.

55
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.440
It's like we're in a fucking James Bond movie or something that's funny with his

56
00:03:04.441 --> 00:03:05.010
accent.
