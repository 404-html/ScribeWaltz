1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:01.920
Yes.
Now,
I mean the,
at least,

2
00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:04.620
at least he's a character like bigger than life character.

3
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.070
You would just flip flop and you don't care and your pants are hanging off just

4
00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:12.650
to get on a flight to Boise.
Just come on.
Why Boise Boise,

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.690
I love boys.
I'm just,
what's the issue?
Because it's a shorter flight.

6
00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:18.000
I didn't want it to be,
I was like,

7
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:22.410
you can't even get it together for a short flight.
You know,

8
00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:25.380
it's disgusting.
And it was weird.
It is weird.

9
00:00:25.381 --> 00:00:27.980
It's just come on ideas about footwear.

10
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.250
I judge people when I see them with Yeezys on,
yeah.
Including Jamie.

11
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.130
I have something right there.
No,
I don't know.
You gave me some,

12
00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:40.131
I don't have exactly where she sat right here when you go there was like six

13
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:43.740
months ago,
right when he gave him to me in the box right there.

14
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.020
I've contemplated running in them,

15
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.470
running through like a cream and filming it because people love these things so

16
00:00:49.471 --> 00:00:52.300
much.
But uh,
I don't want to run it on,
are they expensive?

17
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.370
Cause I like running and choose it are actually supposed to be running in.
Yeah,

18
00:00:56.371 --> 00:00:59.900
they're expensive.
He's,
he gets it.
Look at him.
He's upset.
Jake,

19
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.860
Jamie's one generation younger than me.

20
00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:04.760
So his like idea what these things are is different than mine.

21
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.010
I feel like they're mad at you for saying that right now.
Some people are,

22
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:10.830
some people think it's hilarious.
You would do that.
That would run with them.

23
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.980
I know they're mad at me,
but they're dominant.

24
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.190
We're mad at me for what I would do with a pair of sneakers.

25
00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:20.250
You're a fucking idiot.
Right?
And you need to get your shit together.

26
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.350
It's nothing to worry about.
Thinking about sneakers too,
right?
Are you happy?

27
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.500
Are they just sitting here and there's fucking people think I'm joking.

28
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.060
What do they look like?
They're sitting here and this fucking box.
I'm not joking.

29
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.790
I mean I didn't plan this out there.
They're here.

30
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.340
The people who are into them are like,
oh my God,

31
00:01:38.341 --> 00:01:41.180
you got him there and you're not.
You go home and you're not even for Austin.

32
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.190
He should be out flaws in man where

33
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.550
he's taunting me cause I mock his all the time.

34
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.680
It looked like some sneakers from the eighties some,

35
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.260
but it's like they look like the sneaker version of that Shitty Mustang from

36
00:01:58.261 --> 00:01:59.280
1979

37
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.910
no man,
the cool whole backend sticks out like this.

38
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.200
The heel has like a duck bill behind you.
It's so stupid.

39
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.270
It's so bizarre.
Yeah.

40
00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:21.900
Look dumb that Kanye West has a large effect on humans.

41
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.210
Very interesting area.
Family feud.
They were on family feud.

42
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.560
Well,
I just heard Howard stern talking about,

43
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.590
I hope they ask them tough questions just to,
just to see the ballpark

44
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.150
is try it.
Try being a book and that house,

45
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.130
you will collect dust motherfucker.
We read,

46
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.290
I don't care.
It's broken up into chapters.
Read Shit.

47
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.360
I'll stay read tweets.
