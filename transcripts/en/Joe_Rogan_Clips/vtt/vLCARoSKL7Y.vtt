1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.330
That's the only way for justice to be served and non binary.
Yes,

2
00:00:03.331 --> 00:00:04.164
but what does that mean?

3
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.090
She's in her gender can switch throughout the film depending on where she is on

4
00:00:09.091 --> 00:00:13.980
binary gender flux,
gender fluid,
gender fluid.
Sorry,

5
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.970
what's your Pronoun Today?
A czar.

6
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.420
I'm always wanting to have a z in there.
These are cool.
Yeah.

7
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.980
Zoro Zara.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.820
I feel like your highness.
Oh,
that's good.
That's a good,
yeah,
that's good.

9
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.770
Yeah.
Your Highness can be a guy or a girl.
Whoa,
whoa.

10
00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:42.390
It's gender neutral.
Your Highness.
Now if you said I'm a princess,

11
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.350
I would go,
okay,
well you're gendering yourself.
That's true.
Yeah,
that's true.

12
00:00:46.351 --> 00:00:47.430
And I refuse to do that.

13
00:00:47.431 --> 00:00:52.170
I have two little boys and you know we forced them to be gender neutral.

14
00:00:52.171 --> 00:00:56.280
They don't,
I was watching a show,
not a legit show on that from Cambridge.

15
00:00:56.281 --> 00:00:59.550
This couple was raising their kid gender neutral.
They look,

16
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.010
they have two kids and they're both like wearing like whatever they're wearing

17
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.290
like weird clothes.
I like.
It didn't necessarily,

18
00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:08.680
literally they were wearing boys clothes,

19
00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:11.970
a girl's clothes and they didn't call them girls or boys and let them play with

20
00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:16.800
anything they wanted and they didn't call them boys.
What did they say?

21
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.390
It was fucking weird.

22
00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:23.391
It was just some poor guy who stuck with some crazy bitch and she's,

23
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:24.271
you know,

24
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:27.780
and he was probably trying really hard to be like progressive and like figure

25
00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:28.980
out a what,
you know,

26
00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:33.900
how do we not gender our children and yeah and it's interesting you do that

27
00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:35.700
voice cause they all do up speak.

28
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.760
They do most the only way to show your progressive because if you didn't notice

29
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.440
conservative people just don't talk like that.

30
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.630
Need to stop the caravan before it gets to the wall.

31
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.910
Donald Trump is our savior cause he's like the one who really appreciates like

32
00:01:56.911 --> 00:02:01.440
American values and never hear that it's,

33
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.130
it's only,
it's a super liberal calling.
It is.
It is.

34
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.600
Back to this non binary,
uh,
we,
we did a clip on your mom's house.

35
00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:14.260
There is a couple somewhere in the Netherlands and they had a three year old Zim

36
00:02:14.261 --> 00:02:15.770
or child and another dessert

37
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.460
and every day they would ask the three year old,

38
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.730
what gender do you feel like today?
And I'm like,
boy.

39
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.080
And I'm like,
I have a almost three year old.
I'm pretty sure he doesn't know.

40
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.950
He doesn't think in terms of,
yeah,
he's like,
I don't know,
I'm whatever.

41
00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:37.950
But to put the pressure like what are you today?
What are you feeling?

42
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.330
My eight year old loves to play with things like race cars and she used to love

43
00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:49.290
to play with trucks and she used to love she's,
yeah,

44
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.630
she,
she,

45
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.970
she loves to play with superheroes and things like that.

46
00:02:56.971 --> 00:02:59.470
Like some of them are like very boy,
but again,

47
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:04.330
she loves pink and she likes getting her nails done and she likes looking pretty

48
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.640
and she's,
there's some cool shit that boys like that girls like to like,

49
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:10.780
she's pretty aggressive,

50
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:13.870
which she takes me to my main classes and she throws boys around.

51
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:18.270
She gets like super hyped up when she has to wrestle with boys.
She really,

52
00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.300
she has,
it's crazy to watch like a little psycho aggressive eight year old,

53
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.410
but she's also like really sweet,
like the sweetest kid.

54
00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:30.460
Everybody just gets like real competitive with that kind of stuff.
Yeah.

55
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:33.400
They say that that's the magic age eight,

56
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.600
nine in girls and then,
uh,
where they're very confident.

57
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.160
It's like the end of the confidence era and then puberty strikes and the

58
00:03:42.161 --> 00:03:46.150
hormones take over and the pressure.
Yeah.
To be sexy.

59
00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:50.260
So PIPPI Longstocking that cool.
Last character who was doing that shit?
Remember?

60
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:54.940
PIPPI Longstocking beating up cops.
She said she had like a treasure trove,

61
00:03:54.941 --> 00:03:59.770
so she was,
uh,
she was a millionaire on her own.
Her Dad was a pirate.
Really?

62
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:03.930
Hell yeah,
I do watch those on Pippi Longstocking thanks very much.

63
00:04:03.931 --> 00:04:07.190
And remember the name.
I don't remember the narrative.
Oh,
she was great.

64
00:04:07.191 --> 00:04:09.650
And it was subtitled poorly.
And her lips,
you know,

65
00:04:09.651 --> 00:04:11.270
didn't match up with what she was saying.

66
00:04:11.271 --> 00:04:16.130
It was on channel five and la every Sunday afternoon.
Where's it from originally?

67
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.330
Uh,
Sweden,

68
00:04:17.331 --> 00:04:21.350
I believe Astrid Lindgren wrote these books about her daughter who was that age,

69
00:04:21.351 --> 00:04:25.500
eight,
eight years old is a magic age.
There she is the original one.

70
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.960
It'd be long stockings.
And she said,
girls are kind of smelly,
kind of awkward.

71
00:04:29.961 --> 00:04:32.780
And that's before puberty robs you of your,
uh,
you know,

72
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.760
why not fuck this new school?
I'm talking about,
oh,
seven days,
bitch.

73
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.870
Oh,
there she goes.
She's got a monkey.
Hey,
had a monkey.

74
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.550
I know you love monkeys.
Monkeys.
Is that a monkey?
A scarf?
Yeah.

75
00:04:46.551 --> 00:04:50.960
I didn't choose bag.
She beat the shit out of people.
Wow.
Uh,

76
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.610
but yeah,
I think I play with the boy stuff too,
because my dad,

77
00:04:55.611 --> 00:04:58.490
I was raised by a single dad somewhat,

78
00:04:58.491 --> 00:05:03.290
so he gave me like a BMX dirt bike and I would write it in the La River,

79
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.400
you know?
And then I liked dolls too.
And that's what makes a female comics.

80
00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:06.840
So you might.
