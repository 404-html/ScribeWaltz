00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.180
This a whole experiment and self government is the best on the planet earth,

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.660
but without a doubt.
But this guy,
it's not his fault.

3
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.440
That is who he is.
But he exploited it.
He showed everybody,

4
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.080
he showed everybody the holes in this fucking goofy system.
I know,
but it's,

5
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.050
he's a reality star.
Man can be president one day and you could you and me,

6
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.600
if we could run,
that's the ticket.
If Rogan Rawlings ticket,
we,

7
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.760
we could win and I'm not bullshitting.
You know,
we can win.
I could do that too.

8
00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:33.960
They did some fucking Vegas odds and they found out that I have better chances

9
00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:38.370
of winning then a lot of people that would be freaking Rad.
Yeah.

10
00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:40.740
There's like a whole like list of people who had better,

11
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.780
I like to see you just like throwing them out.
I got this,

12
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.210
but it's,
you know,
I mean no one's going to

13
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.900
work.
The most fun in that I'm having,
right this second is not even in this room.

14
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.610
So I manager my PR person,

15
00:00:56.611 --> 00:01:00.860
her back there waiting on me to fuck up on talking about politics.

16
00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:03.360
See I don't have one of those.
I don't have.

17
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.750
My manager is awesome and my PR person is nonexistent,

18
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.820
so let's get round three going,
let's go.
Here we go.

19
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.180
Seltzer Salute America,
America,

20
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.210
whoo.
I'm telling you,
it just keeps getting better.
Yeah,

21
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.170
it does keep getting better.

22
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.730
It's good whiskey or Tequila or whatever the fuck it is.
I forget now.
Yeah,

23
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.120
politics are the,
that is the one thing that,

24
00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:32.100
that people say you shouldn't talk about.
But I like,

25
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.710
isn't that what helps us to talk about it?

26
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.140
It's just that people are so fragmented.

27
00:01:37.141 --> 00:01:41.100
People fragment out everything you say and they're like,
well you know,
it's like,

28
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.750
it's like the,

29
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.940
you said something but then they turn it into this one little sentence going,

30
00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:48.770
wait a second.
He said these two descripted averages and this fucking now and,

31
00:01:48.771 --> 00:01:53.760
and this verb.
And look what he said.
He said cunt screening.
You heard him?

32
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.130
I told him if he would have,
I cut screening.com

33
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.170
I don't know what I'm going to do with it,
but where do you use it?
Well,

34
00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:03.180
if we could just figure out a way to put micro chips in,

35
00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:06.540
everybody will know everybody is and what everybody did and that way we'll know

36
00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:11.480
if you're a cut.
He walked past this little thing and it goes,
beep,

37
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.500
beep.
You'll walk by.
He throws Burritos,
but he's a good guy.
