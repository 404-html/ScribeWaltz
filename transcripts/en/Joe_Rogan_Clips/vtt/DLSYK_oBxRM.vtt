00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.600
One of the things about hunter that's really intoxicating is that his sort of

2
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:11.331
self destructive path becomes romantic when you read it and you get involved in

3
00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:15.540
his work and you kind of mimic it,
you know,
it's uh,

4
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.460
that's the greatest fallacy I think.

5
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.630
I think what he was trying to say with self destruction was that this was an

6
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:25.140
incredible threat to our American democracy.
Not,
I don't mean that,
I mean,

7
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.680
I mean his,
no romanticism teaching his,
well,

8
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.270
I mean the romantic aspect of it was that his work was fantastic.

9
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.470
I mean,
window was till it wasn't,
it was fantastic till it was,
it wasn't,

10
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.830
I mean he understood,
he didn't feel it was,
but he lived in with,

11
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.890
he spent much more time within the consequences of that pinching than he did

12
00:00:46.891 --> 00:00:48.840
within the success of the bingeing.
Right.

13
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.050
And that I think he knew that it has letters.

14
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.130
It's really beautiful and heartbreaking.
And in his writing too,
I mean,

15
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.190
I think that's what's been missed about him is there's no romanticism and self

16
00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:03.120
destruction right.
Towards the end.
He definitely lost his productivity.

17
00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:06.750
And Yon Warner talked about that in the Alex give me documentary.

18
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.130
He just sticky fingers.
It was a great,
the document,
uh,

19
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.130
the new book on the New Book on Yon Winner has great moments of Thompson,

20
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.470
the 70s just being kind of lost.
Yeah.
You know,
and I think,

21
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.820
I think we got to remember that we have an incredible times in American history.

22
00:01:20.821 --> 00:01:24.130
We have times that are going to burn brightly and it's up to each rider to

23
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.180
decide how they'd like to burn next to it.
And if you're going to burn brightly,

24
00:01:27.181 --> 00:01:28.860
they may not have other times.

25
00:01:28.861 --> 00:01:32.520
And that's I think an American thing where you can wager that bright flame,

26
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.530
which means you may have nothing left afterwards,

27
00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:38.690
but Thompson knew that he may have to live in that kind of afterlife.

28
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.180
I want one.
Thompson writes about it so beautifully.
Um,
stories,

29
00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:47.070
I tell myself there's some footage of him when he was writing for,

30
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:51.270
I forget what newspaper somewhat was it somewhere in the Pacific northwest.

31
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.250
What are ways you're writing for?
Who is the author of playing off the rail?

32
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.230
Google.
Uh,
playing off the rail.
There's a guy who was a journalist,

33
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.670
but year,
do you think it was David Mccumber?
Yes.
David [inaudible].

34
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.090
David McCumber employed hunter for a while when David was,
um,

35
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.610
I forget what publication he was working for,

36
00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:14.950
but there's some footage of them community to communicate together and you know,

37
00:02:14.951 --> 00:02:15.610
it was trying to get,

38
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.950
hunter has in San Francisco was in San Francisco and hunters out of his fucking

39
00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:23.310
mind.
I mean it was younger.
You mean he wasn't even that old,

40
00:02:23.311 --> 00:02:27.630
but he was just wrecked.
He just couldn't communicate.
He couldn't talk and uh,

41
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.740
you know,
he made a beat.

42
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.890
He makes the beast have you escape the pain of articulation.

43
00:02:31.891 --> 00:02:35.130
You escape the pain of saying this is what's wrong in American society.

44
00:02:35.131 --> 00:02:38.760
For him to say the way he did,
one of his great essays is from 1964.

45
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.790
It's by going to Hemingway's Ketchum,
Idaho.

46
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:44.980
I'm grave and Hemingway's house and it,

47
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.810
it's gorgeous because it talks about Hemingway was a good writer,

48
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.950
one of the best writers.
And when he was writing about an up period,

49
00:02:52.951 --> 00:02:54.660
he understood the 1940 [inaudible] 1930s,

50
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.230
when there was a firmness to the reality that he could articulate.

51
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.880
One of the goals is to give a pattern to chaos,

52
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.080
is to give an articulation of CAS.

53
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:06.220
But what happens in the 1960s when the chaos is multiplying repeatedly,

54
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.010
somebody like Hemingway becomes a literal relic.

55
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.820
Like his narrative no longer fits into the present that he's in.

56
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.590
And Thompson saw Hemingway's decline and he wrote about Hemingway's,
um,
uh,

57
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.720
suicide by his narrative doesn't fit Hemingway's idea of what America was and

58
00:03:22.721 --> 00:03:26.530
what a man should be fit perfectly with what I think w the twenties to the

59
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:28.030
forties when we experienced.

60
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.690
But I think in the early 1960s with our social upheaval of civil rights,
of,
um,

61
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.680
you know,
political upheaval,
Hemingway,
it was confusing to them.
It didn't,

62
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:36.910
it didn't fit anymore.

63
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.270
Like his way of operating no longer articulated the presence.

64
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.650
And so Hemingway's last act was to take away his ability to say anything at all.

65
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:47.770
That was his only the last thing we ever said was to stay,

66
00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:49.270
I'm not going to say anything anymore.

67
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.030
Was the suicide that Hemingway committed and Thompson wrote about that core?

68
00:03:53.031 --> 00:03:56.230
Justly.
Yeah.
When,
when I was young,

69
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.330
when he wound up killing himself,

70
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.550
it was almost unsurprising,
you know,

71
00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:07.870
when,
when I read that he had died,
I remember going,
Oh man,

72
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.090
well I guess,
yeah.
You know what I mean?
I mean,

73
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:16.270
it's like you knew that he was deteriorating rapidly.

74
00:04:16.271 --> 00:04:21.130
You knew that he had really bad hips.
He had had hip replacement surgery,
um,

75
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.560
the Ralph stepping leg.
Yeah.

76
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:28.561
Ralph Steadman had drawn this very crazy image of him with the artificial hip

77
00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:32.710
and yeah,
it looked like pain,
you know?
I mean,

78
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.030
but I think that it's not my place to even deal with that because Juan

79
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.100
Thompson's book writes about that moment where one Thompson was in the house and

80
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.440
that's,
that's,
that's his,
and one writes beautifully about the stakes of it,

81
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.550
how painful it was to the people that loved him chorus.
Everything about it.
Um,

82
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.540
and how that even if that's a logical outcome at that's not,
no,
it needed it.

83
00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:54.910
So it's interesting,
I would say read stories.

84
00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:59.350
I tell myself that moment is so honestly and brilliantly written by Warren.

85
00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.570
No,
I'm sure.
But Bama,
oh,

86
00:05:01.571 --> 00:05:06.250
I was getting at is that at the time of his death,
you know,

87
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.530
he was in to sort of,
uh,
the,

88
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.490
he was deteriorating so badly.
He was wearing diapers.
His,

89
00:05:15.491 --> 00:05:18.640
his entire cause of his alcoholism has ability to control.
His bladder was gone.

90
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.960
And so one gave this wonderful speech at George Mason when he came out and he's

91
00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:24.340
like,
how do you write honestly about your father?

92
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.500
And he asked the question of like,
should I include this detail?
And he's like,

93
00:05:27.501 --> 00:05:29.740
if my father was alive,
I couldn't include that.

94
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.190
But that's why I chose in a sense to write my book where my father was dead

95
00:05:33.191 --> 00:05:35.590
because I think my father would want me to write honestly,

96
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.680
but also not want me to clue that if he was still alive.

97
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.560
And so he included that detail and he talked about that,

98
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.380
the struggle to include that detail,

99
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.840
which I think brilliantly articulate what you're saying,

100
00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:50.500
which is the deterioration in the sadness of it.
And I mean,

101
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.470
we have finite amount of energy or effort.
We really do.

102
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.250
We have to take care of ourselves.
And if we don't,
we will pay that price.
Um,

103
00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.920
at some point we're gonna pay it anyway.

104
00:05:58.921 --> 00:06:03.020
So we're all headed to the same place that we want to or not,
you know?

105
00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:08.021
And so I think hunter's a really terrifying and beautiful example of one wager

106
00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:13.310
of chips that were made for the 1960s and 1970s and I think the best way to

107
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:15.010
honor that is to,
you know,

108
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.080
apply the brilliance that he forged and carved to the situation we have right

109
00:06:20.271 --> 00:06:23.340
now with corruption.
Donald Trump,
um,
uh,

110
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.060
an attack on American democracy where American democracy is basically,

111
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.800
it's like what early on says democracy is a train and we arrive at the station,

112
00:06:30.801 --> 00:06:33.800
we get off,
like they'd be basically use the ladder to get to the attic.

113
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.420
And now Trump's pulling up the ladder.

114
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.060
And I think Thompson would understand that really,
really well.

115
00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:41.630
And I think reading him now,
whether you know him or not,
helps you,

116
00:06:41.631 --> 00:06:44.840
and that's why I wrote free kingdom,
was so that it can be a lens on his,

117
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.950
his work going back or just on this present right now,
regardless of.
