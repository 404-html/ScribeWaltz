1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.110
The good guys that these companies weren't actually companies that they were on

2
00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:06.750
our side against the corporate world.
And it turns out,

3
00:00:06.751 --> 00:00:09.030
I think we've just hit this moment.
You mentioned Zuckerberg.
We,

4
00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:12.480
I think we've culturally come to this moment now where,
you know,

5
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:16.160
I think symbolized by his testimony to Congress that,
uh,
those,
that,
that,

6
00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:18.510
that honeymoon period is over,
people now view him,

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.600
I think quite firmly and squarely as a CEO of a very rich company as opposed to

8
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.130
a guy in my club that I'm friends with WHO's on my side against the world.

9
00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:33.700
You know?
And,
and that's how Google used to have that slogan,
don't do evil evil.

10
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.180
They still have it.
I mean,
the problem is the incentives are all wrong.

11
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.110
And I'm sorry,
I actually,

12
00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:44.580
I was just at Ted and will they give you a sense of how far the rot has spread

13
00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:48.140
here?
So I was,
I found myself at a dinner sitting next to a,
a,

14
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.250
a neuroscientist who thought that it was an Ezra Klein thing,

15
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:55.500
followed me around at Ted.

16
00:00:55.501 --> 00:01:00.420
And it's because many people have listened to the podcast and he thought Charles

17
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.390
Murray should have been physically attacked at Middlebury.

18
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.520
This is a neuron is a neuroscientist academic,
you know what,

19
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.970
like a impeccable person.

20
00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:13.200
Otherwise I think he was after we wound up having a fight.
Oh,

21
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.981
at dinner over it.

22
00:01:13.981 --> 00:01:16.560
I think he was somewhat chagrined by having expressed that opinion.

23
00:01:16.561 --> 00:01:21.561
But I mean that's how how emotionally hijacked people are by this issue and uh,

24
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:26.740
but it's a um,
that's incredible.
I mean it was just,
yeah,

25
00:01:26.741 --> 00:01:29.460
it was other thing that's new.
This is the other thing.
It's new.

26
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.210
The left advocating for violence.
This is very new.
Yeah.
Yeah.

27
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.920
I mean I always felt like the,
the left was a nonviolent.

28
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.950
The,
the,
the whole idea behind being progressive like nonviolence was,

29
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.830
was a genuine aspect of that.
And free speech walls.
Two things.
Yes.

30
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.630
Those are two things that have been sort of stopped.
Yeah,

31
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.180
free speech is fine as long as you're not saying speech that I disagree with and

32
00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:58.710
nonviolence.
Sure.
In less we need to use violence,
which is like,

33
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.030
and the people that are saying it.

34
00:02:00.031 --> 00:02:04.800
Like if you watch these Antifa people like Jesus Christ,
the most incompetent,

35
00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:06.420
violent people you've ever seen in your life

36
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.450
offends your sensibilities as an MMA guy.
Fucking,

37
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.720
you guys are terrible at it.
There's videos of these guys practicing.

38
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.600
There's videos of Antifa they had,

39
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.070
they got together and decided to train and prepare for violence and so they're

40
00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:26.940
doing these martial arts classes.
They have people teach them like holy shit,

41
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.910
like at the average high school kid could fuck you guys up.

42
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.220
Like this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in my life.

43
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.810
But it's almost like they're,

44
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.960
they realize that there's not that much danger in what they're doing and they

45
00:02:39.061 --> 00:02:42.060
can kind of play with danger.
They can play with violence.

46
00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:46.320
They can put the masks on there that,
you know,
they're not in Israel,

47
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.910
they're in check out of the Gaza Strip.
There are a bunch of counts.

48
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.450
There's a guy,
there's a guy who went to my old university I graduated from,

49
00:02:51.451 --> 00:02:53.600
so asked before I did my masters at the LSE.

50
00:02:53.601 --> 00:02:56.090
So [inaudible] has been embroiled in a strike at the moment.
It's,

51
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.240
the student's Union has been supporting,
uh,

52
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.100
professors who were on strike and it's over pension and pension rights and

53
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.630
refused government refusing to raise their pension rights and whatever.

54
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.010
And some of the students came out in strike file f students defending uh,

55
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:10.000
the professors and they put up,

56
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.910
they put forward a ring preventing students from attending their classes and,

57
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:14.140
and,

58
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.140
and a female black lecturer wanting to cross the strike lines to go in to teach

59
00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:25.291
her students a white male public school educated,

60
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.120
very,
very middle class protester.

61
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.480
Far-Left physically attacked her,

62
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.200
he physically attacked a female black professor.

63
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.260
So gone is suddenly gone.
Is The white privilege gone?

64
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:40.360
Is the male attacking a female,
you know,

65
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.140
gone is all of that non violence in the name of ideology.

66
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:48.940
He legitimized and allowed himself to attack a black female,
by the way.
Oh.

67
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:51.670
And she was also Muslim,
so she was,
she went to the prep.

68
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.400
You would've had the right [inaudible] in our interview.
She said,

69
00:03:57.401 --> 00:04:00.640
I'm a black Muslim female and is my kid is just a tie for wanting to teach.

70
00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:05.440
My class is crazy.
This is crazy.
It's a crazy world we're in,
man.
This is.
