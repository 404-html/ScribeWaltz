1
00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:00.750
You know,

2
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.750
I'll do three different hotels in a week cause I'll do like a Thursday,

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Friday,

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.630
Saturday like with gigs and then by the time Sunday rolls around I'm a mess in

5
00:00:09.631 --> 00:00:13.850
rough shape.
Yeah.
Is that what it is?
Yeah,
I mean it's a threat detection thing.

6
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.740
Uh,
I mean if you look at other species,

7
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.530
they can do this much more impressively than we can.

8
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.770
So dolphins or any sort of seed dwelling mammal can actually sleep with half a

9
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:29.820
brain.
So one half of that brain goes into deep sleep.

10
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.270
The other half is wide awake.
That's how people,
the DMV do it.

11
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.810
Those people that work at the department of motor vehicles,
they're there.

12
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.980
They work half asleep.
You ever meet him?
I haven't.
No.

13
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.190
Just teasing you will a DMV listen and going fuck you man.

14
00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:47.940
Next time you come in and get your license renewed,
there's my next NIH grant,

15
00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:52.440
I think looking at the DMV and sleep.
But yeah,
we essay workers.
Same thing.
Same,

16
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.700
same type of human that I've come across.
Yeah,
them too.
I'm just kidding.
Fuckers.

17
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.080
Relax.
Um,
so when you're in a hotel room,

18
00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:05.490
what is happening that you're half your brain is not really sleeping?

19
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.630
Yeah,
so there's different stages of sleep.
There are two principle types.

20
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.070
One is non rapid eye movement sleep or non rem sleep.
The other is rem sleep,

21
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.630
which is also known as dream sleep and non rapid eye movement.

22
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:21.960
Sleep is further divided into four separate stages,
um,

23
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.260
which are unimaginatively called stages one through four.

24
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.500
We're a creative bunch is easy to remember that just it is true.
Uh,

25
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.230
but I think it's also a low Iq but it's the deep stages of sleep three and four

26
00:01:34.231 --> 00:01:35.880
of that non rapid eye movement.

27
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.210
That's where a lot of sort of body replenishment takes place,

28
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.720
grief for the cardiovascular system,
metabolism,
all of those good things.

29
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.170
But that's the deep sleep that one half of your brain will resist going into

30
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.910
when you're sleeping in a foreign environment.

31
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.410
So it stays in this kind of lighter stage,
almost like a threat detection system.

32
00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.030
And you can imagine why,
you know,
it's an unusual context.
Evolutionarily,

33
00:02:00.031 --> 00:02:03.120
it would make a lot of sense to just have that sort of on guard.

34
00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:07.290
One half of the brain don't make so much sense and that,
that,
that really,

35
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.210
for me,
it fills in the blanks of like why even if I get,
you know,
seven,

36
00:02:12.211 --> 00:02:16.620
eight hours sleep on the road,
I'm still kind of just out of it.
Yeah.

37
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.600
And that's in fact,
probably one of the,

38
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.020
I think the most impressive parts of new research on sleep.

39
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.730
It's not just about quantity,

40
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.940
it's also about quality and quality can be as detrimental if you don't get it as

41
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.130
a reduction in total quality.
I mean,
both are essential,

42
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.440
but I think it speaks exactly to your point.

43
00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:39.270
You just don't feel like it's a refreshing sort of deep sleep.
Um,
yeah,

44
00:02:39.271 --> 00:02:42.150
it feels totally different.
Um,
it just,
it feels like,

45
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.440
I guess I would say it feels like half asleep.
Yeah.
I mean it's,

46
00:02:45.441 --> 00:02:49.500
it's really kind of out.
It does feel.
Um,
one of the things that I noticed,

47
00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:53.640
I did this thing with my friends called sober October where we,
um,

48
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.970
didn't smoke any pot or Dooney no drinking at all.

49
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.280
Nothing for a month and a when I did it.

50
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.600
One of the things I've found is that after about,
I don't know how many days,

51
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:09.601
but it was noticeable that I would have these incredibly vivid dreams and then I

52
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:15.031
had read that marijuana does something to suppress heavy rem sleep.

53
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.020
Like what,
what?
What is happening there?
Yeah,
so both of those chemicals,

54
00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:21.850
both of which are used as a sleep aid,

55
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:25.900
alcohol and marijuana are actually very good at blocking your dream sleep,

56
00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:27.220
your rapid eye movement,
sleep.

57
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.270
And so what happens is that the brain is quite clever in this regard.

58
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:36.271
It builds up a clock counter of how much dream sleep you should have had but

59
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:37.690
have not been getting.

60
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.790
And it starts to develop this increasing appetite and hunger for dream sleep.

61
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.350
So that finally when the alcohol actually gets out of your system sober October,

62
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:48.730
the liver,
the name,

63
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.290
that's all of a sudden where you get what's called a rem sleep rebound effect,

64
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.980
where you not only get the normal amount of rem sleep that you would normally

65
00:03:56.981 --> 00:04:00.070
have,
you get that plus the brain tries to get back.

66
00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:04.530
Some of that dream sleep that it's been losing over the past,
maybe 11,

67
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.930
11 months.
Um,
so you get this right,
20 years.

68
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.950
I didn't want to make any assumptions.
Uh,
so,
um,

69
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.880
so you get this rem sleep rebounded effect and that's where you have these

70
00:04:14.881 --> 00:04:18.600
really intense dream sleep,
um,
situations.

71
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.090
It's the same reason that people will,
they'll say like,

72
00:04:21.091 --> 00:04:24.240
I had a bit too much to drink last night.
Maybe it was a Friday or Saturday.

73
00:04:24.241 --> 00:04:27.780
They sleep in late and they say,
I just have these crazy dreams.

74
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.790
What happens there is a kind of a,

75
00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:34.770
an acute version where the alcohol is swilling around in your system and after

76
00:04:34.771 --> 00:04:38.790
about six hours,
your liver and your kidneys to finally excrete it,

77
00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:42.870
all of the alcohol and your brain has been deprived of dream sleep for that

78
00:04:42.871 --> 00:04:46.770
first six hours.
So then it feasts in the last couple of hours.

79
00:04:46.771 --> 00:04:50.550
And that's why you have these really bizarre dreams after you've been drinking a

80
00:04:50.551 --> 00:04:52.270
little bit too much.
Oh,
wow.

81
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.800
So what is happening with marijuana though specifically?
Do you know?

82
00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.630
Yeah,
so marijuana,
um,
it,
it does help.

83
00:05:00.631 --> 00:05:04.380
People will help it.
It puts people to sleep quicker.

84
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.910
Although I think the question is whether it's really naturalistic sleep or not

85
00:05:08.911 --> 00:05:13.750
that they go into.
Certainly with alcohol it's not that nightcap idea is,

86
00:05:13.751 --> 00:05:16.650
is a misnomer.
Alcohol will actually,

87
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.640
well it's a form of drugs that we call the sedatives and sedation is not sleep.

88
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.430
It's very different,
but we often mistake one for the other.

89
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.540
Marijuana seems to act in a physiologically very different way.

90
00:05:27.541 --> 00:05:29.910
It doesn't target the same receptors in the brain.

91
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.280
So it's unclear whether this speed with which you fall asleep after having a

92
00:05:35.281 --> 00:05:39.600
session with marijuana is actually natural sleep.
Let's assume it is the problem.

93
00:05:39.601 --> 00:05:43.050
However,
is that it?
Then we'll start to disrupt rem sleep.

94
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.360
It will start to block the process.

95
00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:47.600
We think perhaps at the level of the brainstem,

96
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.770
which is where these two types of sleep,

97
00:05:49.771 --> 00:05:53.130
non rem and rem sleep we'll actually get sort of worked out.

98
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.180
That's where marijuana may actually impact dream sleep and shut it down.

99
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.790
Block it.
Have there been any studies on chronic marijuana smokers like those uh,

100
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.900
dawn to dusk type characters that just are constantly high?
Like,

101
00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:10.670
and what happens to their brain from not cause they must never hit rem sleep.

102
00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.290
Yeah.
So people haven't looked at marijuana.
They have looked at alcohol though.

103
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:19.420
Hmm.
Exactly that.
So what happens is if you look at alcoholics,
um,

104
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.320
they will have some thing often when they come off alcohol suddenly called

105
00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:29.270
Delirium tremens which is where the sort of DT there,

106
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.220
what happens is that the alcohol has been blocking dream sleep for so long and

107
00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:37.640
the pressure for dream sleep is built up so powerfully in the brain.

108
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.980
It actually just spills over into wakefulness.
And so the brain just says,
look,

109
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.460
okay,
if I'm not going to get this dream sleep whilst you're asleep,

110
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.650
I'm just going to take it whilst you're awake.

111
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.920
And so you start to essentially dream while you're awake.

112
00:06:51.921 --> 00:06:55.790
It's this sort of collision of two states of consciousness.
So you get delirium.

113
00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.360
Wow.
I always thought the dts were detoxing.
Other one,

114
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:04.970
someone said someone's going through the dts delirium.
Tremor.
Yeah.
Delirium.

115
00:07:04.971 --> 00:07:06.450
Tremens mm.

116
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:10.340
So what like what is going on with them when this is happening?

117
00:07:10.341 --> 00:07:14.270
So if they are going through this delirium during the day,

118
00:07:14.271 --> 00:07:17.570
while they're conscious,
what's physiologically happening.

119
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:22.780
So it's almost as though the veil of rem sleep gets pulled over the waking brain

120
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:23.810
as it were.

121
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.050
So you have this mixed state of consciousness that you can pick up with brain

122
00:07:27.051 --> 00:07:30.500
wave recordings
and he just tells me,

123
00:07:30.501 --> 00:07:35.501
I mean in some ways how necessary sleep must be if that's the lengths that the

124
00:07:36.741 --> 00:07:40.850
brain will go to to get that,
which it's been missing.
Yeah.

125
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:42.920
Just shows you why,
you know,

126
00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:47.560
it took mother nature 3.6 million years to put this thing called an eight hour

127
00:07:47.561 --> 00:07:49.010
sleep necessity in place.

128
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.860
And we've come along and within the space of a hundred years,

129
00:07:51.861 --> 00:07:56.450
we've lopped off almost 20% of that if you look at the data.
Wow.
Really?

130
00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:01.370
Yeah.
And so many people take pride in that too.
I don't need eight hours sleep.

131
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.730
I got three,
I'm good.
Ready to go kick ass and dominate the world.
Yeah.
Yeah.

132
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:10.040
It's the sort of like sleep machismo instead of attitude.
There is a lot of that,

133
00:08:10.041 --> 00:08:13.490
right?
Yeah.
Many baby.
I like sleep.
Well,
I mean,

134
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.800
you'd be glad to know that.
Then,
you know,

135
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:19.850
men who sleep five to six hours a night,
we'll have a level of testosterone,

136
00:08:19.851 --> 00:08:24.710
which is that of someone 10 years their senior.
So a lack of sleep will age.

137
00:08:24.711 --> 00:08:29.270
You buy a decade in terms of that critical aspect of wellness for reality and it

138
00:08:29.271 --> 00:08:33.560
muscle strength testing,
sexual performance.
Incredible.
Wow.
