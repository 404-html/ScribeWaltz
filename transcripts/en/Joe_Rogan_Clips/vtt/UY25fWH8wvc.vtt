00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.280
Trey,
my daddy Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.
Well they a,

2
00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:07.740
Khabib and Tony are going to fight again though,
right?

3
00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:09.520
Aren't they totally wants to do to the culture.

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.780
But here's the thing that makes a bead might not be able to make that weight.

5
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.360
And you know,

6
00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:18.990
since Kelvin missed wait a couple of times and Dana forced him to find it,

7
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.780
one 85 I mean,
it makes sense that Dana goes,
dude,

8
00:00:21.781 --> 00:00:25.890
you got to do one 70 at least once or twice,
but we only missed one.

9
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.480
Go up in weight to fight him.
Well,
he only missed weight once or twice.
Twice,

10
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:35.250
twice.
Tony,
a huge filter again against anybody's tall,

11
00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:38.180
but he's not.
He's like,

12
00:00:38.181 --> 00:00:43.181
Tony is like five ten five 11 Tony's bill perfect for the division and he's got,

13
00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:48.450
he's got a lot of muscle.
Even though he's long.
He's very strong.

14
00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:52.220
He's excellent in the clinch.
I was looking forward to that fight so much.

15
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.150
My heart,
how big is it?
Could be,
it could be.
Got a huge frame.
It's a tank.
No,

16
00:00:57.151 --> 00:00:59.520
he doesn't have a nutritionist.
He doesn't talk.
He's not,

17
00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:01.640
you're not being professionals.
He's thick.

18
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.160
Did you hear what Tony told to get done and wondering when they were like doing

19
00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:09.390
media and it could be with saying something like why do you get your sunglasses

20
00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:12.810
on?
It's like 27 and he's like good luck or their weight cut.
Yeah,

21
00:01:12.811 --> 00:01:17.210
I hear him breathing cause your cardio sucks cause your cardio son.

22
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.930
I said Tony said to him,

23
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.980
do they have to make it at 55 because what do you do with that fucking bet?

24
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.600
That interim title
fight Floyd.

25
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:28.290
What the,

26
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.010
we can't just fucking happened the five but don't you think that that's the

27
00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:34.970
fight that has to be made in that division,
right.
That's the tone.
If it's,

28
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.690
but if he can't make one 55 can he needs to get real and get a fucking die.

29
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.830
I don't know what happened to him.
We don't eat Tiramisu the week of,

30
00:01:43.831 --> 00:01:48.210
I know that he did the corn on the embed and Tony even tweet out like for

31
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.040
shirtless fucking eat Tiramisu.

32
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.240
He really ate Tiramisu that it was on an embedded video.
Whoa.

33
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.210
That's how he smelled it.
He was like,
have fun making weight.

34
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.480
Why here you helped put him puffin garden.

35
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.730
You have to make that fight and can be,
you can do it.

36
00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:04.260
He just said he's made it before,

37
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.830
but we don't know what happened when he had to go to the fucking hospital.

38
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.500
They said he was in massive pain.
Like hold on a second.

39
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.730
Rockhold you're right.
But Luke Rockhold said something.

40
00:02:14.731 --> 00:02:18.380
There was some quote that I had read.
God Damn it.
What did it,
see?
What,

41
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.720
what they said about what,
what did,
uh,
uh,

42
00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:26.520
bebes corner list as the official issue that was happening to him.

43
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.030
He was six pounds overweight,
right?
Yes.
When he went to the hospital.

44
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.780
That's huge.
That's so heavy.

45
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.290
You're so heavy when your body's your body shutting down,

46
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.110
like you're six pounds away and your body's shutting down.

47
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.460
Come in the week of the fight.
Yeah.
But obviously fucked up with his,
uh,

48
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.730
his discipline if he's eating Tiramisu.
If that's true,

49
00:02:47.731 --> 00:02:49.920
that's even more disappointing.
Maybe you just had a bite,

50
00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:53.910
but either way you don't have a,
and I'm not saying it's the answer.

51
00:02:53.911 --> 00:02:56.580
You don't have a mic dolce or one of these guys who are helping you with your

52
00:02:56.581 --> 00:03:00.130
diet.
Right.
Tony's downlinks up and wait to find them.

53
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.830
You can't do that can make sense for Tony.

54
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.260
It makes sense for Tony mean that he wants to fight this guy,

55
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:07.840
but for the division,
it's so weird.
It's like,
well,
what is this?

56
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.693
What's the division?

57
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.120
What is this guy puts the entire fights bigger than what the division looks
like.

58
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:16.590
That fight,
that fight needs to happen.
I agree too.
I agree.
I agree with that.

59
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.150
That handles all this other shit's going on.

60
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:22.990
Mayweather and Garner all this other shit and that's the GSB Bisbing goes here

61
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.130
it goes medical,
it says a weight loss,
weight management,
medical issues.

62
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:30.730
He was treated and it's been discharged.
That doesn't say what the issue is.

63
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.760
This the official us.
See,
see if you could find out.

64
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:37.660
I feel like I read an article that was interviewing Luke Rockhold.

65
00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:41.700
Rockhold was talking about what happened to [inaudible] Dot Gov Ah,

66
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.870
did you see Dana though?
He goes,
if you,
if you will,

67
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.130
we maybe could have safe drinking.
He gave him a beer.
This isn't beer.
What is it?

68
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.070
Oh Shit.
Free.

69
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.430
Someone gave the Gremlin water after midnight.
No,

70
00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.590
but Dana was saying panicles on beer.
Oh,

71
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.770
I'm having one.
That's one.

72
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.650
I knew that the cow.
I got a copy.

73
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.460
You can't leave a guy drinking by himself.

74
00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:15.850
That was the moment the wheels fell off the podcast.
Okay,
here it is.

75
00:04:15.851 --> 00:04:19.540
This is what I read.
Habib wasn't getting any blood to his liver.
Oh,

76
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.550
this is what Luke Rockhold says.
Look,
that is fucking real bad.

77
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.410
So scroll down and let's,
let's see what Luke Rockhold.

78
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.580
It says the weight cut wasn't going very well.

79
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.270
Khabib was complaining about a pain in his side and we had to cut short the

80
00:04:34.271 --> 00:04:37.360
weight cut and sure enough it gets worse.
Over nine had to go to the hospital.

81
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.940
Unfortunately,
this is the fight I was really looking for,
blah,
blah,
blah.

82
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.020
From what I understand,

83
00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:43.570
he wasn't getting any blood to his liver and something went wrong with his

84
00:04:43.571 --> 00:04:45.820
weight cut.
It's very similar to his last fight.

85
00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:48.040
What I understand and just something went wrong.

86
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.780
You never know what these weight cuts.
I guess,

87
00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:54.160
but I think he's ready to go and we can rebook this.
That what is,

88
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.910
he was,
no,
he's a training partner.

89
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.500
He's a AK guys to a hundred pounds heavier training partner.
Yeah.

90
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.030
Well,
from the same gym.
Yes.
I mean,
it obviously ain't a hundred pounds.

91
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:13.030
He's a big deal.
Does he walk around?
That could be,
yeah.
Shit.
I Dunno.

92
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.830
I don't wanna miss the speak.
I'd assume high seventies yeah.
Looks like it,
right?

93
00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:22.120
Yeah.
And he ain't fat.
No.
They got to make that fight,
man.
That's the fight.

94
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.580
I'd say that's the Madison would have been when a fight fell through.

95
00:05:24.581 --> 00:05:27.310
Like when John and a child thing.
I really wasn't that mad.

96
00:05:27.311 --> 00:05:31.630
There's been other fights.
Uh,
John D C I wasn't that upset.
This one.

97
00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:36.190
I was pissed,
man.
I was really upset.
Tony was on fire,
his camp,

98
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.410
everything was perfect.
It was on such a good fighter.

99
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.160
<v 1>Okay.</v>
