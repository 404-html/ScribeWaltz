Hello Freak bitches.
Well,
is being a comedian too,
you mean?
No.

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.840
<v 1>Oh,
it's a bunch of different possibilities,
but it was so chaotic.
Like his,</v>

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.440
his comedy was so wild and crazy.
Like there was,

4
00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:16.260
he was a real ground breaker in that way.

5
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.190
Why else did you get into being a comedian?
I Dunno,

6
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.050
I got talking to you ain't doing it.
No,
I wasn't really very funny.

7
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.600
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.570
So it's just you and your mom and your sister?

9
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.070
<v 1>Yeah,
well my mom remarried my Stepdad who she's still with him.
Yeah,</v>

10
00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:42.790
he's great guy.
Okay.
Yeah,
super lucky.
He's a real good guy.

11
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.850
But um,
it was uh,

12
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.080
I got talked into doing stand up by my friends from martial arts

13
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.680
for real cause we would,
well you must've been funny.
Well I was only funding,

14
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.220
I was like gallows humor.
We would go to compete like,
like,

15
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.570
or we would be about the spar and I would be,

16
00:01:01.571 --> 00:01:04.390
the guy would make everybody laugh because everybody was so nervous because it

17
00:01:04.391 --> 00:01:06.340
was scary.
You beat the shit out of each other,
you know?

18
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.000
And then we would go to these competitions so he'd get on a bus and travel

19
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:12.910
across the country to go fight in these tournaments.

20
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.770
And it was super nerve wracking.

21
00:01:14.771 --> 00:01:18.340
Everyone was super nervous so you could cut the tension with a knife.

22
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.540
So I would always like be doing impressions of people having sex and making

23
00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:26.860
jokes.
And I just,
this was like long before I ever thought about being comedian.

24
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.610
I was just trying to lighten up the mood and that's how I got into stand up.

25
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.770
<v 0>So hold on a minute.
So see,</v>

26
00:01:33.771 --> 00:01:37.280
this is a bit of a surprise to me because when people fight,
you know,

27
00:01:37.281 --> 00:01:40.760
semi professionally or otherwise or at school or what have you,

28
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.620
it's nerve wracking.
That's terrifying because you're scared of

29
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.040
<v 1>pain,
violence,</v>

30
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.180
the anticipation of the possibility of losing.

31
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.440
You're worried about the,
just all the possibilities.

32
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.350
There's the just a full realm of things

33
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.300
<v 0>can happen.
Why do you do it?
I know I'm sounding like a mortar on,</v>

34
00:02:02.301 --> 00:02:05.540
I just have never had the opportunity to ask anyone who's ever done this.

35
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.410
<v 1>Um,
I was very insecure and um,</v>

36
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.760
I got bullied and I wasn't big.

37
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.680
I was a small kid and I was really nervous and I did not like that feeling at

38
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:19.440
all.
And I did,
I was always,
we were always moving around a lot.

39
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.680
We was moved to new places.
I was always the new kid.
No,
my,
my,

40
00:02:23.681 --> 00:02:25.650
my mom married my Stepdad.

41
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.330
We moved across the country from New Jersey to San Francisco and then we lived

42
00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:33.390
there for a while and then we moved to Florida and then we moved to Boston and

43
00:02:33.391 --> 00:02:37.260
he,
he switched careers and he was a computer programmer and then became an

44
00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:39.560
architect.
And so this is a lot.
Yeah,

45
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.890
there's a lot of traveling and I just was always the,

46
00:02:43.891 --> 00:02:47.790
the new kid and the new kid gets fucked boys.
And most of the time it was fine,

47
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:51.390
but as we got started getting older,
that's when it got creepy.

48
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.320
Like most of the time it was no big deal.
Like at nine and 10 it's no big deal,

49
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.380
but when it gets to be like 13 and 14,
then it starts getting violent.

50
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.900
And so like kids would pick on me and I didn't know how to fight.

51
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.260
And it drove me crazy.
Like I was like,
God,
I fucking,

52
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.560
I hate the fact that when these kids want to fight me,

53
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.950
I don't know what to do and I'm,
I'm terrified.
So I'd be like,
go,

54
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.280
go home the long way around.
So I'd avoid everybody and that kind of shit.

55
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.720
So I decided to learn martial arts.
I said,
well,
what am I afraid of?

56
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:23.170
I'm afraid of people that know how to fight.
Well,
I'm really know how to fight.

57
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.310
So I went into,
it did,
it became my whole life like from,

58
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.670
from high school freshman year on really from,
um,

59
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.010
15 is when I went crazy.
So from 15 on a,

60
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.700
that's all I did every day,
like six,
seven days a week I was teaching,
I was,

61
00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:44.520
I became a,
I was,
I was teaching when I was 17,
I was a,

62
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.281
that's what I was doing.

63
00:03:45.281 --> 00:03:50.170
Like every day I was teaching at Boston University when I was 18 and 19 and I

64
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:55.000
was,
became my whole life.
Born in Boston.
No,
I was born in New Jersey.
I come,

65
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:57.880
you don't have the crazy accident.
Got Rid of it.
Hurt myself on TV.

66
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.530
I won the bay state games.
It was this big,
like an Olympic festival.
Um,

67
00:04:03.531 --> 00:04:06.760
whether they had all the Olympic sports and was taekwondo had not been in the

68
00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:09.070
Olympics yet,
but it was about to be,

69
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:11.080
so they had it in the bay state games and I won.

70
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.980
So they interviewed me on TV and I remember Tom,

71
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.250
I was like very specifically say we were working really hard and I was like,
oh,

72
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.040
I heard that accent.
It was so bad.
I heard the video and I was like,
oh my God,

73
00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:25.420
what the Fuck is wrong with me?

74
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.590
Like I had taken on that accent out of insecurity because I only lived there

75
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.650
since I was 13 so from 13 to 19 and six years I developed a stupid accident.

76
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.730
I wanted to finish it.
Yeah.
And then I realized I'd done it once,

77
00:04:38.731 --> 00:04:39.564
so I abandoned that.

78
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.660
But it'll come out a little bit if I get drunk like every now and then somebody,

79
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.000
some words because he didn't grow up in it.

80
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.980
Of course it's gross when you hear it at a girl fact.

81
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.350
It's just like,
it's like too many Ar,
the ar thing,
it stretches out.

82
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.230
Although the artist didn't speak like that.
No,
I wish this beautiful.

83
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.730
I like that accent is pretty,
there's something about the Boston accent,

84
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.600
just particularly gross.
So sorry to these questions.
Please don't worry about it.

85
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.550
You are fighting.

86
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.050
And then your pile talked you into becoming my friends,

87
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.470
Steve Graham to my friends,
ed shorter and Steve Graham,
Steve Graham,

88
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.920
still one of my best friends today.
He was an ophthalmologist at the time

89
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.730
and still encourage you to go to,

90
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.840
he told me I should be a comedian in class or like literally grabbed me by my

91
00:05:34.841 --> 00:05:37.630
shoulders and said,
you should be a comedian.
So then what happened?

92
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.930
I went to an open mic night.
I watched the amateurs try it.

93
00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.990
And one of the good things about amateurs is,
uh,
if you go to watch,

94
00:05:43.991 --> 00:05:47.290
like most of them don't know what they're doing,
they're terrible.
So I was like,

95
00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:49.810
okay,
well I can't be as,
you know,

96
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.230
at least I'm not going to be the only one who sucks.
So like if,

97
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.890
if I go up and do that,
I can do what they're doing.
They suck.
I suck too,

98
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.800
but they suck.

99
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.420
So it's not like you're going up and Richard Pryor's on Richard,

100
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:04.700
Jenny and all this,
you could take the competition.
Well,
no,

101
00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:07.160
I felt like I wouldn't be the only one who sucked.

102
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.560
Like people who really suck inspire you to do it because they'll,

103
00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.770
they lower the bar of expectations.

104
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.280
Cause like if I went up there and it was all these really amazing Comedians,

105
00:06:16.281 --> 00:06:18.720
and then to me,
I'd be like,
oh,
I can't do this.
I said,

106
00:06:18.721 --> 00:06:22.850
I'm fucking terrible at it because the learning curve of standup comedy so long.

107
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.090
Sure.
And especially when you're 21 you don't know shit.

108
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.120
But I didn't know anything about life or anything.
Well of course you didn't.

109
00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:32.180
Exactly.
Yeah.
So I was terrible,
but somehow or another,

110
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.140
these guys talk me into doing it.
So do you still do your up?
Yeah.
Constantly.

111
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:37.940
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's great.
Yeah.

112
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.920
You turn it around on me.
Sure.
Unless you're dead.
Yeah,
it does.

113
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.650
Clever girl.
Hmm.
Yeah.
I don't know about that.

114
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.170
I wish you don't.
You don't think you're clever?

115
00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.150
<v 2>[inaudible]
okay.</v>
