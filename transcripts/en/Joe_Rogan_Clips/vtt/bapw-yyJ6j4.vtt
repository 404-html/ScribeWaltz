1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.660
He's like,
yeah,
I'm on the fucking,
what the fuck you doing?
He goes,

2
00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.930
you think this is a bad neighborhood?
And he goes,
I just put on a Russian accent.

3
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.240
Everyone's scared of me.
It's like Russians are the scariest white people.

4
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.530
They're definitely not regular white people and the women are the worst.

5
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.150
Arlene Russian women,
they will fucking cut you and laugh at your bleeding.
Whoa.

6
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.550
They're merciless.
My mom,
my grandma,

7
00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:20.950
they would do not fuck around deaf from the old country.

8
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.840
What about Russia woman that you encountered today?

9
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.620
Their worst cause they're liberated.
So they're there.
They're ruthless.

10
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.900
They're very hot.
Crazy in the head.
Crazy in the bed.
Yeah,
but I,
I can't do it.

11
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.360
I can't do it.
What?
That band that the documentary was the could get arrested.

12
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.120
Pussy riot.
Yeah.
Those bitches are low.
I've got to push it.

13
00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:43.330
Free Pussy riot tee shirt.
I don't even know what they did wrong,

14
00:00:43.331 --> 00:00:46.790
but just I'm wearing that shirt.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's the,

15
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.860
it's ballsy to criticize Putin.
Oh yeah.
Mean that is,

16
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.830
I don't care if you're a band or you're a journalist,

17
00:00:53.831 --> 00:00:58.270
like whenever you're doing that guy has killed a lot of people and laughs about

18
00:00:58.271 --> 00:01:02.390
it.
Yeah,
yeah.
You know the Superbowl ring story?
No,
you don't know that.

19
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.650
I want to hear this.
Oh fine.
Google it.

20
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.790
So I don't fuck up the stats because a Sturgill Simpson actually told me this.

21
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.283
The um,

22
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.870
there was a super bowl winner who visited Putin and as he's talking to Putin,

23
00:01:16.871 --> 00:01:18.330
Putin asks him to see the ring.

24
00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:21.970
He's got the soup bowl rang and Putin holds onto it,

25
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.830
puts it on his finger and walks away and then the guy starts going,
hey,

26
00:01:26.831 --> 00:01:29.740
what the fuck?
And Putin's body guards would put their hand on the guy like,
no,

27
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.330
it's over.
Oh yeah,
your fucking ring.
Yes.

28
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.520
<v 1>My friend Sandy Weill,</v>

29
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.960
we have just given all the rings.

30
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.570
I showed sandy my ring and he said,
why don't you show it to the president?

31
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.750
I showed it to him and they put it on and he sort of enjoyed it.

32
00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:53.200
So we kept it on.

33
00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.950
<v 0>He gets his version of it there.</v>

34
00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:02.760
There's a version of it in an actual article that's more detailed where he talks

35
00:02:02.761 --> 00:02:06.360
about how they,
you know,
he asked for it back and they were like,
no,

36
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.970
here's what happened.
The other thing is how he trailed Angela Merkel.

37
00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:13.110
You know this story now,
Angela Merkel is head of German chancellor Germany.

38
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.000
She's terrified of dogs.
So he brings out his giant black lab,

39
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:21.960
which are the sweetest braid.
And this photo is look up Merkel Putin dog.

40
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.110
And she's sitting there terrified to look at it and the dog sniffing her.

41
00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:29.100
It's like a lab and he's just sitting there fucking laughing like an asshole.

42
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.260
And he's like,
oh,
I didn't know she was scared of dogs.
I'm like,

43
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.800
how many world leaders are you're bringing your dog out to meet other than her

44
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.670
and the body language and her.
Yeah,
her,
she's freaking the fuck out.
Oh,

45
00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:42.810
look at her and look at it shows like a little scared of dogs either,
by the way,

46
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.050
at a lab.
Come on.
Yeah.
Fucking weird.
She's like,
Eh,

47
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.650
not fart.
And I learned that was so funny.
Yeah,

48
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.110
he's an asshole.
He's,
um,
it's,

49
00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.740
it's very strange what he's been able to do.
Oh yeah.

50
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.310
Did you see the assassination attempt where the guy drove into his car,

51
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.383
full clip,

52
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.950
changed lanes on the highway and went into the oncoming lane into the fast lane

53
00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:12.820
on the other side.
Full clips slammed into his car and killed his driver,

54
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:17.320
but he wasn't in the car.
Oh my God.
No,
it's why holy,
Holy Shit,

55
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:18.154
it's wild.

56
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.790
It was an assassination attempt and they just didn't know that he wasn't in the

57
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:24.160
car,
but the fact they were able to cut through the lanes,

58
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.370
get into the center where you know they're there,

59
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.880
they have access to the oncoming lanes and pick his car right out of all the

60
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:36.020
car.
I mean,
it had to be coordinated with someone.
Right.

61
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.500
Cause there's gotta be a motorcade,
right?
Because,
well they're,
oh yeah.
Wow.

62
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.610
Oh that's it already.
Oh,
just keeps running it by.
Oh,

63
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:45.720
but just do it from the beginning.
The beginning wasn't gold.

64
00:03:45.721 --> 00:03:48.910
There's a better version of it then there's a better version of it out there and

65
00:03:48.911 --> 00:03:52.800
the better version of it.
You see the guy changed lanes.
Boom.
Yeah.

66
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.610
And Slam in and had to know that that's where his car was killed.

67
00:03:57.611 --> 00:04:01.750
Him killed the driver.
But Putin was not in the car but it was Putin's car.

68
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.320
It's magic.
Well he just knew probably something was up.

69
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.960
I mean he must have a bunch of people feeding them information all the time.

70
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.530
And how many SAS nation attempts have there been on that guy?
Well,

71
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.640
I mean what about the assassination of sun on the presidents that we don't hear

72
00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:19.300
about?
Both Obama and Trump.
There've been plenty.
Really?
Yes.

73
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.280
Like what ones do you look at?
I,
I mean they just Trump.
Yes.
Really?
A red horse.

74
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:26.740
Yes.
I haven't heard anything of course.

75
00:04:26.741 --> 00:04:29.230
Cause they don't want to talk about it cause then he hit the victim and it,

76
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.040
and also you don't want to get these people's attention.
In all fairness.

77
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.810
I think that's a good move to be like,
all right,
let's not talk about this.

78
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.170
Like you don't want to talk about when terrorist attacks are foiled because then

79
00:04:38.171 --> 00:04:40.510
they'll know,
okay this doesn't work.
We're going to try it a different way.

80
00:04:40.511 --> 00:04:43.960
So that's smarter,
that press,
I think,
you know,

81
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.120
but I mean,
he's been able to run Russia for a long time.
Oh yeah.
I mean,

82
00:04:49.121 --> 00:04:52.030
he had his number,
it was like Teddy Roosevelt and Taft.
He had his number two,

83
00:04:52.031 --> 00:04:54.130
there was term limits.
He goes,
you're going to be present.
And I was like,
okay,

84
00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:56.230
I'm done and I'm going to be back in.
And the guy's like,
okay,
here you go,

85
00:04:56.231 --> 00:04:59.590
Mr Putin.
But that's what's crazy is he got back in and everybody's like,
okay.

86
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.380
And His approval rating.
So like 70% or something crazy.

87
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.420
There are some huge number.
The Russians Lovell,

88
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.750
do they love him or do they say they love him cause they're scared?
No,

89
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.020
Russians love aggression.

90
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.040
We love someone who is nasty and an asshole.
