1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.470
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.410
<v 1>So there's really like man eating crocodiles.</v>

3
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.190
<v 0>Oh yeah.
Well there's,
there's definitely Matt.
Any crocodiles?
Is this Jim Shockey?</v>

4
00:00:10.191 --> 00:00:13.400
Yeah,
this is my friend Jim.
And this guy is missing.
Yeah,
it's in Mozambique.

5
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.610
This guy's missing and hand.
This guy's missing his whole arm.

6
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.710
The fence will no wonder they Jim,

7
00:00:18.711 --> 00:00:23.420
he's a lovely Canadian fellow who travels everywhere.
So they,
they've,

8
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.950
he's a hunter and they flew him in to kill these crocodiles for them.
Nice.

9
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.780
It's crazy.
I mean,
look at that fucking thing.

10
00:00:29.781 --> 00:00:34.010
You imagine you're living right there and there's just God damn dinosaurs

11
00:00:34.011 --> 00:00:34.680
everywhere.

12
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.330
<v 1>No.
And furthermore,
if you can,
if you can get rid of the,
I don't know,</v>

13
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.260
it must be a learned behavior because most crocodiles aren't doing that.

14
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.380
<v 0>It's just that they're near people.
They'll,
they,</v>

15
00:00:44.381 --> 00:00:48.640
their brains are so small and there's so,
so reptilian.
Well,

16
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.430
they're just trying to do is eat.
And if it's a moving,

17
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.520
they're going to try to eat it.
And if it's a person solid,

18
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.460
they're targeting people,
but they found out that they can get peach crocodiles.

19
00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.590
I don't think they're just going to eat any old thing.

20
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.690
I think they eat everything they can eat their giant.

21
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.470
Talking about 1800 pound lizard,
it's been the same.

22
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.070
It's exactly the same form for 60 plus million years.

23
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.560
<v 1>You could say the same about sharks and they don't just go eat you.</v>

24
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.640
They would if they could,

25
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.070
if they just decided to start in with the parks and the people they don't eat

26
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.110
get eaten by sharks.
No,
they don't.
They don't ever,

27
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.590
no one's ever been eating mushrooms like very occasionally,
no break.

28
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.770
They are not eaten by sharks generally.

29
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.270
Don't have a taste for our blood is what you're saying.
Yeah.
Yeah.

30
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.060
We're not on the menu.
We're not on the menu,
but they will eat us.

31
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.680
They will bite you to get you out of their zone or they might mistake you and

32
00:01:40.681 --> 00:01:43.170
bite you.
They you,
cause they think there's something else,
but they don't,

33
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.100
you're saying eat,
which means like you sit down and you finish the meal.
Right.

34
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.550
I think that rarely happens.
Usually they just bite you in half and just,

35
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:55.350
you know,
follow this tastes like shit.
Fuck,
oh my zone.

36
00:01:55.351 --> 00:01:57.070
You know,
and like that's the

37
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.250
<v 0>animals that actively target people and it becomes a giant problem.</v>

38
00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:05.420
Like an India.
In India,
there's this river,
this place called the Sunderbans.
Oh,

39
00:02:05.421 --> 00:02:08.980
the bull sharks.
No,
no.
These are tigers.
Tiger Shark.

40
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.810
He pulls bull sharks are very aggressive and they do kill people.

41
00:02:11.811 --> 00:02:15.800
But these aren't tiger sharks.
Are Tigers.
Just the cat.
They kill a lot of people.

42
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.280
Kelly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The the shit out of you.
Yeah.

43
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.200
<v 1>Now sit down and like put the Napkin in their color and get like,
they're like,</v>

44
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.143
yeah.
Yeah.

45
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.900
<v 0>Well,
the actively hunt people in this one place and they've been doing it for</v>

46
00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:29.420
hundreds of years.
If they said over the last 200 years,

47
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.480
300,000 people have been killed by tigers in the Sunderbans.
Alright.

48
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.380
Yup.
Over the last 200 years,

49
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.030
300,000 people have been killed by tigers.

50
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.030
I don't know what to do with that number.
It seems implausible is insane.
Well,

51
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.110
it's just so common.
First of all,
India has a billion people,
right?

52
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.680
And a lot of them are really poor and they live in by these rivers and these

53
00:02:51.681 --> 00:02:55.640
cats are everywhere and it's tall grass.
You've ever seen that video of the cat,

54
00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.140
that giant tiger leaping up and attacking the guy when he's on an elephant?
No.

55
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.420
This is ash shows.
Yeah.
Well shows you pull it up.
Me,

56
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.500
it shows you how crazy India is.

57
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:13.360
This guy's on top of an elephant and he's walking this elephant through this

58
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:17.800
grass and this tiger runs through the grass and leaps up into the air and fucks

59
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:19.680
him up always on this elephant.
Okay.

60
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.630
<v 1>I shouldn't laugh,
but it's kind of funny.
It's like,
it's kind of funny.</v>

61
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.920
What a hell of a tiger.

62
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.870
<v 0>They're,
they're insane.
I mean,
if a tiger was in a movie as a monster,</v>

63
00:03:27.871 --> 00:03:30.410
it'd be what we want to scare us.
Monsters.
Everybody that's on Youtube by the,

64
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.180
Oh yeah,
we can't play it on youtube,
but just everyone knows what it is.
Yeah.

65
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.390
Everyone can easily it on.
You don't pull it down because somebody owns this.

66
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.270
They have a copyright.
So here's the guy,
so he's on top of this elephant.

67
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.670
Now look at the grass and they spot it and then the thing,
yeah,

68
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.750
<v 1>Whoa,
Whoa,
Whoa,
Yep.
Is on.
Oh my God.</v>

69
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.850
Jumps jump

70
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.250
<v 0>and it's going after him.
It knows that he's up there.
Look at it.
It's like bitch.</v>

71
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.670
Well if I were the elephant and I just messed that tiger up,

72
00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.000
tore the guy's arm apart.
The elephant didn't give a fuck.
It's just hanging out.

73
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.910
I looked the elephants like whatever bitch tigers can't kill me.

74
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.920
<v 1>No,
I'm fine.
Even outside,
just stomp on it.
Pretty sure tigers</v>

75
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.730
<v 0>don't kill elephants,
but lions do.
And when lions do,</v>

76
00:04:13.731 --> 00:04:16.790
they're really hungry and they get a bunch of them and they gang up on an

77
00:04:16.791 --> 00:04:17.451
elephant.
Okay.

78
00:04:17.451 --> 00:04:20.060
Don't talk about it cause you're going to talk about the baby elephants that get

79
00:04:20.061 --> 00:04:22.940
ganged up on first.
Oh this is not even necessarily babies.

80
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.110
They'll take out a real elephant.
Well not if it's with the herd.
What is this?

81
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.870
Trying to save a goat woman fights off tiger with a stick.

82
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.260
Let to go Chrysler Lee.

83
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.360
<v 1>I like the kangaroo punching ones.
Those,
that's my name.
That dude,</v>

84
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.280
I want to marry.
That dude
squaring off.

85
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.780
He's like trying to figure it out.

86
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.780
People were mad at that guy who's so cute.

87
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.530
But if you're an animal lover is going to the Kangaroos followup,

88
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.750
his dog Kangaroos,
those male kangaroos fight all the time.

89
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.350
They're always like punching.
That was just like a really fun.
Yeah,

90
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.270
and he's to get his dog.
So I would do this thing run right out there.

91
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.690
It's cause it's got the dog because this guy is so awesome.

92
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.000
Those are so weird.
They don't even seem real.
They seem to human.
Yeah,

93
00:05:15.001 --> 00:05:18.960
look at that.
Look,
here we go.
Turn off thinking about it.
Bam.

94
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.360
I was like,
yeah bitch.
I just love the kangaroo does not know what to do.

95
00:05:24.361 --> 00:05:28.080
He's like,
am I supposed to fight you?
He's so cute.

96
00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.660
<v 0>It's like fuck this.
What a weird animal.</v>

97
00:05:29.661 --> 00:05:34.100
But it bounces off like that on two legs guy though,
right?
Oh yeah,
for sure.

98
00:05:34.101 --> 00:05:36.860
And also that he didn't follow up.
What do you think they were?

99
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.520
What was it doing like just fighting it or play it on a dog was barking.

100
00:05:40.521 --> 00:05:44.390
The kangaroo decided to grab a of dog and get him in a headlock and that's what

101
00:05:44.391 --> 00:05:45.224
they do.

102
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.500
<v 1>That's right.</v>

103
00:05:46.501 --> 00:05:50.050
Like that's like generally giving you time to react a different way.

104
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.460
That's giving you a moment to not escalate.
Yes,
sure.

105
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.980
Because the dogs,
let me,
if you see the beginning of the video,

106
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.300
he's running around this kangaroo,
he thinks he's hunting.

107
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.050
He thinks he's like alerting his company in the car to the target.
Right.

108
00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.050
If you don't even seem like a real animal,

109
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.300
they seem like something from an avatar movie.
Right.

110
00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:11.240
I want to cuddle with them all when I see like,
wow,
I was like,

111
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.660
all I want is to take them all home and just cuddle with them.

112
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.890
The guy punched him right in the face and look at the fur on its belly.

113
00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:22.670
You know that for on their bellies.
Really like soft.
Do you think that's a mamma?

114
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.070
Do you think that was?
I think that's a dude.
That's a dude.
I don't see.

115
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:29.270
I don't see,
well,
he's not as big as he's,
I think that's a woman.

116
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.120
It might be because she's not very big.
Well.
That also makes sense to that.

117
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.840
That's what that pouches were.
The Tummy.
What's happening?

118
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.070
I think there's a little thing right there.
It says something.
Oh,
what's that?

119
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.300
What?
That little thing hanging down there.
You see now the tails back here?

120
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.520
No,
that can't be the penis tales.
Huge.
Right?
Oh wait,
move it.

121
00:06:48.521 --> 00:06:51.500
Move in a second.
No,
that is a penis.
Yeah.
Come on.

122
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.330
Where's the ball bouncing around?
There it is.

123
00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:56.310
Maybe that's just like the curtain for the vast,

124
00:06:56.311 --> 00:06:59.180
they are very developed kangaroo.
He's not going to win many fights.

125
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.990
He's sort of a Beta there,
right?
There's some giant Kangaroos,

126
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:07.490
those big scary world.
So cause this one knocking on the door.
Hey Man.
Hey Man.
Oh,

127
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.470
let me look at the clause.
And it was fun.
Yeah,
that's scary.

128
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.650
That's what I'm saying.
When he put the dog in the headlock,

129
00:07:12.651 --> 00:07:16.510
he could easily have taken care of that dog.
But he didn't.
He like,
yeah,

130
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.280
he kept the head.
He was like,
I'm shutting this down.

131
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:20.820
I really think we're mis-gendering.
Yes.

132
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.210
I think we're mis-gendering that kangaroo like it's a girl.
Oh,

133
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.930
that one looks like a dude.
See you look the difference.
You see his car?
No,

134
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.520
I think they're the same.
That's the same.
That one's super jazzed to do it.
Why?

135
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:35.810
Maybe kangaroo chases people.
