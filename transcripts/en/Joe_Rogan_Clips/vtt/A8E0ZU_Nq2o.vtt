00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.410
Suge knight gear for La.
Did you hear a lot about that?

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.440
Utuber what he's going through?
Logan.
Paul.
I did read that.
Yeah.
He,

3
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.240
he films someone who had committed suicide in Japan and he put it on his youtube

4
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.500
channel.
Yeah,
I guess there's this forest at the,

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.830
the bottom of a volcano or something and it's called suicide,
her,

6
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.920
its nickname suicide forest because everyone just goes her to commit suicide.

7
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.110
And he was going there supposedly to film how it's haunted and then they find a

8
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:33.000
body and it's pretty gross.
How He,
you know,
how the video,

9
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.680
he was a,
he kind of joked about it.
He used humor.

10
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.090
Jamie told me that like the thumbnail had him like posing with the guy,
you know,

11
00:00:42.091 --> 00:00:45.900
in the background and,
and you know,
he's,
um,

12
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.990
I don't know anything about him,
but I know he's a youtube guy.
Right.

13
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.160
And he's doing stuff that he thinks is interesting and provocative,
you know,

14
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.840
and for whatever reason,
the,
the,

15
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.010
the dialogue that I've read was something to the likes of that he had done it to

16
00:01:03.011 --> 00:01:04.540
bring,
he'll apologize for it,

17
00:01:04.541 --> 00:01:08.170
which seemed obviously felt terrible about the way people viewed it,

18
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.360
but that he said that,
um,
how did he describe it?
Um,

19
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.630
he was trying to bring some sort of a,

20
00:01:16.631 --> 00:01:19.600
he thought he was going to bring some sort of an awareness to suicide,

21
00:01:19.601 --> 00:01:20.850
but it was like a clunky,

22
00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:23.720
you just didn't do it right and prayed the respect that it deserved.

23
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.480
He realized that he fucked up.

24
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.620
He's basically saying he's trying to do something and you fucked up,
you know?

25
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.030
I don't know man.
It's pretty great.
I just found out that he's not the same.

26
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.970
Like there's a Jake Paul and a look and Paul,

27
00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:38.880
I thought they were the same person.
Why blood?
Why is everyone mad?

28
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.060
I don't know what anyone's mad at him for the mad at him because he showed you

29
00:01:42.061 --> 00:01:44.490
something you didn't want to see.
Is that what it is?
Because the video,

30
00:01:44.491 --> 00:01:48.000
he kind of like,
they were like,
look at his hands,
they're blue and oh,

31
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.340
he kind of was very poor taste.
He also advertised it like the day before,

32
00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:56.500
like I had this crazy sick video you guys are going to freak out about and you

33
00:01:56.501 --> 00:01:57.331
should act like that.
Oh,

34
00:01:57.331 --> 00:02:00.300
so he got a chance to look at it and he still approved it and then released it.

35
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.661
Yeah.

36
00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:04.560
And then he made a thumbnail where it looked like he posed for like photos with

37
00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:07.830
a guy in the background.
It's a very,
you know,
this was a person and,

38
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.300
and they're like laughing right next to his body.
You know,
it's,

39
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.790
but I dunno how that disturbs the shit out of us.
Right.

40
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.750
Like make it like joking around.
You could joke around,

41
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.640
but you can't joke around near a dead guy.
Well,
suicides not funny.

42
00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:28.470
So it's not,
if the guy died,
natural causes,
no one's laughing.
Yeah,
the suicide,

43
00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:31.860
the laughing at him,
joking around near the guy who committed suicide.

44
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.050
Like I'm not saying you should do it.
He definitely shouldn't.

45
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.960
I don't want to see it.
But it's kind of funny that we like decide,
like you said,

46
00:02:38.961 --> 00:02:42.900
just respectful bro.
But he didn't really do anything.

47
00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:45.330
He just showed up and this guy was dead.
You know?

48
00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:48.000
I'm not saying he should make fun of him.
He definitely shouldn't,
but it's,

49
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.220
it's weird the outrage that we have for it.

50
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.590
I'm sure he made a shitload of money that,
cause I've got 7 million viewers.

51
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.750
He made money off it as suicide.
Yeah.

52
00:02:55.751 --> 00:02:58.130
And you're talking about when we're talking about we're helping them out.
Well,

53
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.150
the video got pulled.
I guess I've got re uploaded a few times.
Yeah.

54
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.110
He just made a second apology today because the first apology a lot of people

55
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:08.900
said was very insensitive.
I'm not defending him.
Don't,
don't get me wrong.

56
00:03:08.901 --> 00:03:10.150
I'm just explore.
Look,

57
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.770
sometimes I try to look at things from as many perspectives as I can,

58
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.870
and I don't,
I don't,
uh,

59
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.800
I don't think that you ever want to make fun of someone dying.
Right.
Right.

60
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.150
When you're right there and you're,
you're,
you're taking videos and you know,

61
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.380
it was a dead body hanging.
That's a terrible idea.
