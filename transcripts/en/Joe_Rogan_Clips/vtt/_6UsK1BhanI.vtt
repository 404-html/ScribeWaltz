1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.440
In all fairness.
Uh,
what I used to see,

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.300
and I saw this many times at Nick's,

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.930
was some poor fuck who had led a couple of TV credits,

4
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:13.770
who thought he was hot shit and they would go on and they would headline at

5
00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:18.771
Nick's and they would stack the deck and it would be horrendous.

6
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.830
It was you and Lenny and fucking Knox and all these savages would go up and

7
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:31.760
Boston style comedy where there's no breaks.
It's just fucking Bang,
Bang.
Right?

8
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.430
Yeah.
There's a style of comedy,
like a,
Hey,
I know you worked all day.

9
00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:37.000
You don't want to hear anybody bullshitting up here.

10
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.270
Everybody talks fast and they're fucking funny.

11
00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:43.320
And Gavin would go up and murder and then these poor bastards would go up after

12
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:46.290
them and just these people with their TV credits,

13
00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:49.800
you would see them just be within five minutes,
they'd be lost.

14
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.090
It'd be very observational.
Have you ever gone to an airport?

15
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.120
What did just don't expect that they would see three worldclass headliners do 15

16
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:02.520
minutes in front of us.
Tell you a funny story about next

17
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.170
Sam Kennison,
right?
He,
you know,

18
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.300
he had been up for a few days obviously,
but anyway,
you know what I mean?

19
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.673
You know the era.

20
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.230
So I said s and Sam was a good friend of mine.

21
00:01:19.231 --> 00:01:24.180
He's a nice guy.
When he was straight,
he had a dark side,
you know,
like we all do.

22
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.550
But I said,
Sam,
this isn't,
this isn't la.
You know,
these guys,

23
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.900
you know Joey the job and bully the frond and fault.
You know what I mean?

24
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.520
This sitting up front and he's,
you know how Sam was and I said,

25
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.730
Sam,
I'm telling you these are the wrong guys to piss off.

26
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.890
They had to fire him because you know,
those guys don't kill it.

27
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.470
They don't.
They don't have any sense of humor.
No.
No.
Well,
not only that,

28
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.370
they don't,
they don't want to be fucked with.
Yeah.
Boston's.
So one of the weird,

29
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.830
some of the weirdest people in terms of like the way the rest of the world
works,

30
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.360
they're ready to fight.
There's a lot of people that are ready to fight though,

31
00:02:04.361 --> 00:02:06.550
ready to fight you.
They're not going to shoot you or stab you.

32
00:02:06.551 --> 00:02:08.110
They're going to beat the fuck out of you,
right.

33
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.820
They're going to do it right then and there and it'll,
it'll happen anywhere.

34
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.880
It'll happen at a restaurant or happen at a bar is one of the last places that

35
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.560
we,
when we used to towards him ready to break out what you would see real fist

36
00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:20.770
fights like all the time.

37
00:02:20.771 --> 00:02:25.000
Like Ari Shaffir used to say that like me and him while we're leaving Faneuil

38
00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:27.940
hall once and there was a fucking brawl breaking out in front of this Mcdonald's

39
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.840
and he's like,
you fucking people are savages here.
I'm like,
I'm telling you,

40
00:02:31.841 --> 00:02:36.640
it's a different kind of human.
It's cold for too much.
The women are assholes.

41
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.510
Like it's,
the men are assholes.
Everybody's ready to fight and everyone's drunk.

42
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.990
It's a different kind of place.
Well,
you know the,

43
00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.360
I grew up in Charleston,
right?

44
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.620
They did a movie about the town and all that bull shit.
It's a bullshit movie.

45
00:02:50.621 --> 00:02:55.540
But anyway,
I grew up over there and you didn't have to win,

46
00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.020
but you had a fight.
And my record was probably

47
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.640
two wins and 30 losses.
And then to,
you know,

48
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.060
there's a lot of draws because they break it up right away,
you know.

49
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.290
But there were actual fist fights.
Yeah.
No.

50
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.530
One time I'm in the projects is kid Davey ladder.

51
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.620
He did the one thing you're not supposed to do.

52
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.510
He kicked me in the balls and then everybody jumped and beat the shit out of

53
00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:23.344
him.

54
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.750
The one thing about kicking people in the balls to don't ever mess.
Yeah.

55
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.320
Cause then the other guy gets very mad.
It doesn't work as good as people think.

56
00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:36.580
It does.
Don't release.
It hurts now will you in street fights.

57
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.760
I started fighting to avoid street fights.

58
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.070
I wanted to fight like is it as an amateur like in martial arts tournaments

59
00:03:45.071 --> 00:03:48.820
because I was scared of street fights while they seem to me,

60
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.180
it seemed to me to a are frightened and he fucking terrifying.

61
00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:54.940
You never know what's going to happen.
People follow you around.

62
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.580
You never know when it's going to.
I was scared of fighting.

63
00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.340
That's why I got into it.
I was,
I just,

64
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.410
I did not like to remember that day when you were in grammar school and a kid

65
00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.240
offers you out.
Yeah.

66
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.210
At eight 30 in the morning and still thinking about it all day early in the

67
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.930
morning till three in the afternoon own.
What's that?
Running down your pants.

68
00:04:13.931 --> 00:04:17.180
Did you just shit yourself here and then you're in the school yard and they're

69
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.690
all circling around you,
you know,
and it's this whole thing.

70
00:04:19.691 --> 00:04:22.450
But my father used to train fighters,

71
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.160
boxers over at the new guard and Jim and me and my brother,

72
00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:32.161
we would get into terrible fights and my father never taught us how to throw a

73
00:04:32.651 --> 00:04:33.730
shot or anything.

74
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:37.420
It just gives us these big enormous fricking gloves and they just let you go to

75
00:04:37.421 --> 00:04:40.630
war on each other.
Yeah,
it was weird.
Why did he teach you?

76
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.410
Probably tired from teaching people all day.
Yeah,
maybe.
Yeah,
it's probably,

77
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.800
maybe he wanted us to beat the shit out of each other,
you know?
I don't know.

78
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.860
That's a good question.
I've not gone to figure it out on your own.
Yeah.
Well,

79
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.410
you know,
I remember coming back and,
um,

80
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.810
this kid beat the shit out of me.
Bobby Buckley and my father said,

81
00:05:04.811 --> 00:05:07.030
what are you doing at home?
You got to go back out there.
What?

82
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.530
I'm going to go back out and fight him again.
Fucking all right.
Yeah.
But I,

83
00:05:11.531 --> 00:05:12.364
you know,

84
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.800
there's a lot of different ways to be like in Charlestown grown up.
I mean I was,

85
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.510
I grew up with some guys that were like unbelievable.
Like,
you know,
there's a,

86
00:05:22.511 --> 00:05:27.310
there's a whole moral thing maybe or a social thing about say robbing a bank.

87
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.610
I mean,
would that ever fricking cross your mind?
No,

88
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.940
but that's a Charles town thing.
That's one thing that is true about that movie,

89
00:05:33.941 --> 00:05:37.720
that town,
but,
but what I was in awe of people that would do it.
It's like,

90
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.180
where do you get the boss that you know?

91
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.570
And I'll never forget this friend of mine,

92
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.930
Joey Rocco's no longer with us.
So I see him up at government ember.

93
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.480
You remember government center?
Yeah.

94
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.790
So I see them up there and he's got like his lunch and I said,
Joe,

95
00:05:54.791 --> 00:05:59.300
how you doing?
And he's kind of blew me off.
Then I see him a week later.
He says,

96
00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.590
say Swayne's,
what's up?
I said,
what's up?
You blew me off a week ago.

97
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:05.750
He said,
Oh,
I'm so sorry.

98
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:10.550
I was waiting to Rob Crimson travel and I had my gun there and I was into was

99
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.570
interrupting his work.
So he came into Nick's comedy,

100
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:18.200
stopped to 400 people.
I did fantastic.

101
00:06:18.201 --> 00:06:21.440
I was like practically a standing ovation,
whatever.
So Joe's in the audience,

102
00:06:21.441 --> 00:06:24.830
right.
And I,
I,
so I talked to him afterwards.

103
00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:29.270
So there's a number of things he could say like,
Jeez,
I liked his show.

104
00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:32.030
I didn't like your show.
Good for you.
Getting out at Charlestown.

105
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.280
He gave me this look.
I was like,
wow,
it's got to be a lot of money in here.

106
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.300
I said,
you think I'm here to case the joint for you?

107
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.870
It was unbelievable.
We used to,
I'm part of the thing that bugged Charlestown,

108
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.510
grown up with see how to shoplift that was,
did you do that when you were a kid?

109
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:54.140
Like,
shit,
I got caught shoplifting.
Candy,
candy.
Yeah,
you were bad.

110
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.920
You probably was terrified right.
Again to God.

111
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.620
I got brought into a manager's office,
I think it was 12.
Oh yeah,

112
00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:05.330
I got in trouble.
I was terrible too.
I was so paranoid.
But anyway,

113
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:10.420
there was a department store called Jordan Marsh and my job was to catch a

114
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:17.300
football.
They throw me the football,
I'd catch it and run down Tremont street.

115
00:07:17.301 --> 00:07:22.100
So we've just,
you know,
stolen a football.
Right.
So that's,
that was the Gig.

116
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:24.990
So one time I'm up there and uh,

117
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.290
saw the kid says to me,
pick up the end of this canola.
I said what?

118
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:35.650
He said grab the end of the cannula still in a fucking canoes was all walking

119
00:07:36.651 --> 00:07:36.861
down.

120
00:07:36.861 --> 00:07:41.210
Wash the student Boston with a condo right now I don't know where you're from

121
00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:45.590
but it's not a big item and Charlestown canoes and the projects,

122
00:07:45.591 --> 00:07:46.281
you know what I mean?

123
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:49.580
It's like not something that you felt you couldn't fence it.

124
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.200
Did you take it to the Charles River?
I don't know what we did with it.

125
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:55.090
Like you'd do try to,

126
00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:58.280
you end up either giving it away as selling it for like three bucks.

127
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.490
Cause that was back then that the river was very,
very dirty.

128
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.630
Like I used to swim in that.
Oh,
that was the,
uh,

129
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.830
well we used to call the oilies because there was so much oil in it.
Yeah.

130
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.780
And better now though,
right?
Didn't they clean it up a little bit?

131
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.550
That's what they say.
You know,
they made,
they've cleaned up the whole of Boston.

132
00:08:16.551 --> 00:08:17.900
I don't recognize boss anymore.

133
00:08:17.901 --> 00:08:22.550
They've got this pot of Boston called the sea port.
It's all these big buildings.

134
00:08:22.551 --> 00:08:26.240
It's like fricking Dubai,
you know,
there's no kids,
there's no neighborhoods,

135
00:08:26.241 --> 00:08:30.800
there's no characters.
It's all just gentrified in a very rich people now.
Right.

136
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:35.630
Yeah,
I apparently,
yeah.
What is it like bankers who,
who's got all that money?
I,

137
00:08:35.631 --> 00:08:39.950
that's what I keep asking myself.
Who,
who does have all this money?
Yeah.

138
