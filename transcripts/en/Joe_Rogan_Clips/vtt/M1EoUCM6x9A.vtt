WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.830
I can't give blood because they have a tightness.
Which one do you get?
B or c a.

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.610
Is that a good one?
Yeah,
that's the,
that's the one miss easy one.
Oh that's nice.

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.530
Yeah.
It was like a month down yellow eyes.
Yeah.
Yeah.

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.530
Like no energy a month.
That was,
yeah,
that uh,

5
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:19.860
that's a long story.
But that,

6
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:24.861
that I actually got it from a guy who was sort of saving me from something else

7
00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:29.550
that I,
they never told you the whole Scorpion and Guatemala story.

8
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.080
I think you did.
But tell me again.
Well,
it's a long story.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,

9
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.180
and you don't now though.
People will be,
well I feel like they're getting,

10
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.530
people can hear it.
I,
I've told her on my podcast and I've also,

11
00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:45.510
I told her it on a podcast called risk and I,
that's actually cliff notes.
Uh,

12
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.140
yeah,
but listen to the risk thing.
If anyone would see,

13
00:00:48.141 --> 00:00:51.090
hear the whole thing cause they added sound effects and it's really good.

14
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.640
What is risk?
It's a,
it's a podcast.
It's called,

15
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.200
it's a storytelling thing,
you know,
it's like the moth.
It's that kind of thing.

16
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.870
And they added sound effects and they produced it really well.
Yeah,
as well.
Yeah.

17
00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:07.380
What happened was I was,
I was with my girlfriend at the time,
Puerto Rican,

18
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.580
super beautiful Puerto Rican girl.

19
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.630
She tried to get you to go to a camp away and talk about Jesus or,
no,

20
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.030
she never tried to talk to me about Jesus,

21
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:18.360
but I would have listened because she was interested in how the APP,
no,

22
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.950
she was great.
Um,
so I was with her and Guatemala and,

23
00:01:22.951 --> 00:01:27.670
uh,
we had met this other couple,
um,

24
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.680
Solange and,
uh,
Fabrizio.
Whoa.
And,

25
00:01:32.681 --> 00:01:34.380
um,
yeah,

26
00:01:34.381 --> 00:01:39.180
we were at this place called t Carl in a North East Guatemala,
way,

27
00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:43.440
way back in the jungle.
And it's a Mayan ruins.
Beautiful,

28
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.660
crazy.
You know,
it was like a big city and now they're,
you know,
when I was there,

29
00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:52.420
this was 1989,
there were maybe 10 big ruins,

30
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.380
big temples that they had uncovered.
And,
uh,

31
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.160
we're staying in this camp site with hammocks.
It was very primitive at the time.

32
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.770
Anyway.
Uh,
we,

33
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:06.771
it was a full moon and Ana and I decided we were going to take some acid and

34
00:02:07.411 --> 00:02:12.411
watch the moonrise and the sunset up from the top of tumble for,

35
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.160
it's called the Jaguar temple.

36
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.530
And so we went up with this other couple and there's this ledge up there and

37
00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:22.050
it's up above tree line.
You know,
you're way above the tree line.

38
00:02:22.051 --> 00:02:24.230
You can see the monk here are the monkeys and,

39
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.160
and like see out over this flat jungle,
the Battan,
I think it's called.

40
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.660
And um,

41
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.720
so we're up there and the sun's sinking and the moon is rising and the moon

42
00:02:36.871 --> 00:02:38.730
comes up and it's beautiful.
And,

43
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.760
and there's this big bank of storm clouds and the full moon is like between the

44
00:02:44.851 --> 00:02:46.380
horizon and the storm clouds,

45
00:02:46.381 --> 00:02:49.790
but then it starts to go up behind these clouds and you can see it's going to

46
00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:52.770
get dark as fuck.
Right?
So this other couple like,
yeah,

47
00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:55.890
we're going to go back to the camp side.
They didn't know we were tripping.
Right.

48
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.680
And we timed it.
So we were peeking like now.

49
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.750
And so they're going to go back to the camp sites.
So we,
but we were like,
yeah,

50
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:06.310
we're going to just hang here.
Right.

51
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:10.600
So I went over to hold the flashlight for them as they went down this ladder.

52
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.440
He was like maybe a 30 foot ladder,
pipe ladder drilled into this,

53
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:18.400
the temples made out of limestone blocks.
And so to get up there,
yeah,

54
00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:23.320
there you go to before.
So we're at steep.
Yeah.

55
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.840
Is that type of climbed up?
Does that temple for though?

56
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.430
The Jaguar example?
I typed in temple for Jaguar.
Okay,
cool.
Yeah.

57
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.950
Yeah.
When I was there it was much more overgrown.
Yeah.
Anyway,

58
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:43.000
so we,
we went up to the top of it.
That looks like it.
They're on the right.
Yeah.

59
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:45.820
That looks like it from like when we were there anyway,

60
00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:48.170
so we're up on that ledge there and uh,

61
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.270
and see how flat the the jungle is.
It just goes forever.

62
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.130
It's so crazy how it's almost like uniform and height.
Yeah.

63
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.740
I mean it's just very,
very little bit,
but oh,
look at that picture.
Yeah.
Yeah.

64
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.480
Oh Man.
It looks like a picture I took actually up there.
Um,

65
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.400
anyway,
so it's so beautiful.
So we're up there and,

66
00:04:12.401 --> 00:04:13.234
uh,

67
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.250
and I'm holding the ladder for these guys going down and they're like,
okay,

68
00:04:18.251 --> 00:04:22.660
we're good.
I'm like,
okay.
I turned off the ladder and I take a step and fuck,
oh,

69
00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:25.270
what the fuck was that?
I turned the flashlight back on.

70
00:04:25.271 --> 00:04:26.800
I see the Scorpion going up the wall,

71
00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:31.000
stirring up the wall like four inches green.

72
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.880
And then they're like three other ones on the wall.
It's like,

73
00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:36.850
fuck this things crawling with fucking scorpions.

74
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.990
And I just got stung on the toe while you're on acid while I'm tripping and

75
00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:44.910
thank God I didn't jump cause I would've dropped 30 feet to fucking rocks,

76
00:04:44.911 --> 00:04:46.180
you know,
God.

77
00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.070
So I go back to ana and I was like,
Shit.

78
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.860
She said,
what happened to you?
I said,
I just fucking Scorpion.
Like,

79
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:58.270
watch out and like,
oh Jesus.
Right.
Oh my God.
So we're kind of like,
oh,

80
00:04:58.271 --> 00:05:02.890
are they dangerous?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Are they?
I don't know.
So,
um,

81
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.980
now it's getting dark,
right?

82
00:05:04.981 --> 00:05:09.640
Cause the moon's going behind these clouds and there's this other,

83
00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:14.080
these two dudes like way over on the other side of the ledge and we go over to

84
00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:18.040
them and they're Italian and they don't speak English,

85
00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:20.260
but honest spoke Spanish.

86
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.680
So she was talking to them in Spanish and Italian and you could sort of

87
00:05:23.681 --> 00:05:25.720
understand,
you know,
they're both Latin,

88
00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:29.320
similar languages and those guys are like,
ah,
I don't know.
And we were like,

89
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.600
watch out cause they're all around like,
oh shit.
Yeah.

90
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.260
So while we're talking to them now it's totally dark.

91
00:05:35.261 --> 00:05:40.261
This Guatemalan dude comes up the ladder with an old bolt action rifle and he's

92
00:05:40.391 --> 00:05:42.250
like the night guard or something.

93
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.930
So we go over to him and honest as to him in Spanish,
um,

94
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.030
is sewn belly,
some petty gross was a Scorpio and they got,
are they dangerous?

95
00:05:52.031 --> 00:05:55.750
The Scorpions and the guy says [inaudible],
I'm worth those.

96
00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.940
Oh they're lethal.
They're deaths.
Oh my God.

97
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.010
Fuck man.
I understood enough Spanish to get that thinking.
You're dying.

98
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:08.570
So I'm like,
yeah,
this is this.
Is it April,

99
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:11.060
full moon of April,
1989 yeah,

100
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:13.880
I was 27 it was right around the time of Trump's plane crashed.

101
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.010
What if it was exactly the same?

102
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:21.030
I think talking about being mercury was in racism in your life.
Yeah.
Yeah.

103
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.540
I was at a table with that Puerto Rican girl.
Why would you,

104
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:26.180
where would that other Puerto Rican girl up there?
Porter remained.

105
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:30.410
Girls crossed our path.
We both survived.
She was barely.

106
00:06:30.411 --> 00:06:34.760
So what happened to you?
So I'm thinking like,

107
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:35.991
fuck,

108
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:39.830
I got to get down from here because there's no way anyone else could carry me

109
00:06:39.831 --> 00:06:42.950
down the ladders and you couldn't get a stretcher down.
Right.

110
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.390
So if I'm going to survive,
I got to get down on my own quickly.

111
00:06:47.391 --> 00:06:51.080
So then they fight collapsed.
They can get an ambulance,
all that.
We're like,

112
00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.640
you know,
two days from Guatemala City and whatever the town was.

113
00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:58.040
I don't even know if they had a clinic or I don't know.

114
00:06:58.041 --> 00:07:01.850
But we were pretty remote and I'm like,

115
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:05.870
they're not going to send out a helicopter or some shit like that.
Right?
So,
uh,

116
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.610
I get down,
I,
oh,
so what happens is my girlfriend's freaking out.

117
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.360
Um,
no,
no criticism of her.

118
00:07:14.361 --> 00:07:18.230
I think it's much harder to watch someone you love die than to die yourself.

119
00:07:18.231 --> 00:07:22.580
And in this case.
And so she's like,
Oh fuck,
you're dying.

120
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:24.540
And I'm thinking,
Gee,
maybe.

121
00:07:24.541 --> 00:07:28.970
And so the one of the Italian dudes is like,
look,
you guys go,

122
00:07:28.971 --> 00:07:32.090
I'll stay with her and make sure she's all right.

123
00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:34.340
And so I go down with his other Italian dude.

124
00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:37.570
We go down the ladder and we get down to the floor.

125
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.240
We started walking around the jungle and it's fucking totally dark now.

126
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:45.740
Cause the moon's totally obscured.
And the jungle,
you know when you're tripping,

127
00:07:45.741 --> 00:07:45.981
you're,

128
00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:50.420
your pupils are super dilated so you can see light and stuff that normally you

129
00:07:50.421 --> 00:07:51.254
might miss.

130
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:56.410
Like the jungle in Guatemala was full of glowing worms and shit flying by.

131
00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.990
It's all like green and we're and,
yeah.
Yeah.

132
00:07:59.991 --> 00:08:04.010
And they're like these caterpillars and like really shit,
this place is wild.

133
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.180
So we're walking around lost,
totally dark tripping.

134
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.750
I'm tripping.
He doesn't know I'm tripping.
How,

135
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:16.730
how trip and Aria tripping.
That was three head nods,

136
00:08:16.731 --> 00:08:19.910
ladies and gentlemen.
I mean,
you know,

137
00:08:19.911 --> 00:08:23.990
I'm peeking from the acid plus all the adrenaline,
right?

138
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.730
And so this pain is running up my leg.
And as it,

139
00:08:27.731 --> 00:08:31.280
it's like running up the bone in the center of the leg.

140
00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:35.540
This is kind of fire.
And when it gets to the top of muscles,

141
00:08:35.541 --> 00:08:39.290
they've seize up.
So like,
you know my from the knee down,

142
00:08:39.291 --> 00:08:42.140
it's just like rigid.
And I,

143
00:08:42.141 --> 00:08:45.830
and then my tongue starts swelling and my throat starts swelling.

144
00:08:45.831 --> 00:08:50.831
And I got this like novacane feeling and my lips and I'm sorta drooling.

145
00:08:51.141 --> 00:08:54.830
And um,
and I'm thinking when this gets to my heart,

146
00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.980
that's when I die.
And so I'm,

147
00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:03.270
I'm with this guy and we're lost.
And,
and at first you're like,

148
00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:05.490
I'm freaked.
I'm look scared.

149
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:10.520
And then it occurs to me that I'm saying my last words to a guy whose face I've

150
00:09:15.301 --> 00:09:18.120
never seen,
cause we didn't shine the light in his face.

151
00:09:18.121 --> 00:09:19.260
And we were talking to him

152
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.310
and he doesn't understand English.

153
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.760
And that cracks me up that I just,

154
00:09:26.761 --> 00:09:31.320
I start laughing like a fucking maniac and he's like,
got his arm around me.

155
00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:35.040
He thinks I'm like losing it.
And I'm just like,
this is hilarious.

156
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:39.900
And I think about my friends and how they're going to be like,
yeah,

157
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:44.010
you know,
good on Chris.
You know,
he didn't die in some dumb ass way.

158
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.060
Like we all thought he would.
He died in this.
It's still a dumb ass way,

159
00:09:48.061 --> 00:09:51.330
but at least it's interesting.
And then I started thinking,
you know,
all right,

160
00:09:51.331 --> 00:09:54.930
I'm 27 but I've been around the world.

161
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:59.490
I literally around the planet,
I've been in love.

162
00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:04.470
I've had sex with gorgeous women who loved me,
who,

163
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.910
you know,
I've,
well,
I made a shit ton of money.

164
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:12.630
I walked away from it.
I,
I've done,

165
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.480
I've done everything I wanted to do.

166
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:21.230
I'm 27 but I've done everything and I've had a fucking amazing life.

167
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.920
Wow.
And this is cool.
I would have been crying like a bitch,

168
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.460
I believe.
Not.
Yeah.
You know,

169
00:10:29.461 --> 00:10:34.260
I felt really bad for my parents and,
and Ana.
But for myself,

170
00:10:34.261 --> 00:10:37.320
I was like,
I've had a good fucking run.

171
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:41.970
It's not as long as I would've liked,
but I've had a good fucking run.
So I,

172
00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:47.060
I really came to this piece and like,

173
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.750
the world doesn't owe me shit,
man.
I've had,
I mean,

174
00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:55.290
I'd been in Alaska two summers at that point.
I worked in New York,

175
00:10:55.291 --> 00:11:00.291
in Manhattan for two years at that point with a guy who offered me $1 million if

176
00:11:00.691 --> 00:11:04.380
I would stay.
And I said No.
And I left.
I flew to India.

177
00:11:04.381 --> 00:11:06.210
I had been in Asia for two years.

178
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.630
You've said no to a million bucks when I was 26.

179
00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:13.580
Why did you say no to a million bucks?
What was the catch was you need to do,

180
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:18.310
do you know he was a really good guy actually.
Uh,
I liked him a lot.
Um,

181
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.950
the million bucks was,
he said,
when you're 30,

182
00:11:22.951 --> 00:11:25.680
you'll have a net worth of $1 million.
And if you don't,

183
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:30.330
I'll write you a check for the whatever you're missing and we'll notarize it.

184
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.000
And this guy's worth $30 million or something.

185
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.290
So he just wanted you to work for him.
He wanted me to stay and I wanted to go.

186
00:11:37.291 --> 00:11:38.580
I wanted to see the world.

187
00:11:38.581 --> 00:11:43.581
And this guy hired me to help him manage his family's property in midtown

188
00:11:44.761 --> 00:11:45.594
Manhattan.

189
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:49.050
And the main reason he hired me is because I didn't give a shit about money,

190
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:52.740
so he knew I wouldn't steal from him.
Ah,
that's interesting.

191
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.980
And when it stopped being fun and knew,
I was like,

192
00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.730
I gotta go.
And he's like,
no,
no,
stick around.
I'll make it worth your while.

193
00:12:00.731 --> 00:12:04.360
And so there was this weird dynamic.
But anyway,
I,

194
00:12:04.361 --> 00:12:09.040
I'd had all these experiences and so I was like,
Hey,
I've had a good run.

195
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.660
So anyway,
we finally,

196
00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:14.380
we come out into this little parking lot and there's this Guatemalan kid there

197
00:12:14.381 --> 00:12:18.100
maybe 10 or something,
and the Italian guy talks to him and says,
Scorpion,

198
00:12:18.101 --> 00:12:20.710
Scorpion.
And the kid looks at me like,
oh my God,
come,
come.

199
00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:25.730
And he takes us to this trailer and we bang on the door and this horrible

200
00:12:26.411 --> 00:12:28.060
fluorescent light comes on.

201
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:33.390
And this like Guatemalan Dude who obviously had been drunk and asleep,

202
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.210
you know,
it was like what?
And like the kid says he's the doctor,

203
00:12:37.211 --> 00:12:41.230
he's not a doctor,
he's some jungle dude,
whatever.
And the,

204
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:46.180
so the guy takes us in and he's talking,
you know,
it's sort of just Saki,

205
00:12:46.181 --> 00:12:49.450
broken English.
And I explained to him,
he says,
how big is the Scorpion?

206
00:12:49.451 --> 00:12:53.260
He looks at my foot,
he says,
how big was the Scorpion?
I said,
yeah,
like this big,

207
00:12:53.261 --> 00:12:58.250
like a finger and what color?
Gray,
green sort of.
And he says,
ah,
yeah,

208
00:12:58.251 --> 00:13:01.070
yeah,
yeah.
That's not a scorpion.
That's electron.

209
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:06.070
So in Spanish and that part of Guatemala anyway,
they're two different words.

210
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:09.190
A beyond is a little red thing.

211
00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.490
[inaudible] is a big green thing,

212
00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:17.470
but they're both with the tail in know.
And uh,

213
00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:21.280
so we had been using the word Scorpion because in English that's all there is.

214
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:26.530
But Scorpion,
a Scorpion in that part of Guatemala is lethal.

215
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.730
And that's a little tiny thing.

216
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:32.470
That's a little red thing and that will fucking take you out.
But the guys like,

217
00:13:32.471 --> 00:13:36.280
look,
you're still,
this was two hours ago and you're still alive.
You'll be fine.

218
00:13:36.281 --> 00:13:39.910
Apparently it's like if you have a bad heart or you're a kid,

219
00:13:39.911 --> 00:13:44.410
maybe this'll kill you,
but if you're,
if you survive a couple of hours,

220
00:13:44.411 --> 00:13:48.390
you're going to be Ra.
Speak fucking take you out.
But the guys like,
look,
you're,

221
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:51.670
this was two hours ago and you're still alive.
You'll be fine.

222
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:55.300
Apparently it's like if you have a bad heart or you're a kid,

223
00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:59.830
maybe this will kill you,
but if you're,
if you survive a couple of hours,

224
00:13:59.831 --> 00:14:00.460
you're going to be all right.
