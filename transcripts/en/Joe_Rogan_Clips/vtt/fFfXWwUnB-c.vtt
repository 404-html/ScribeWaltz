WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:00.900
Yeah.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.470
And then he decided to bulk up how many picos all vomit.

3
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.430
No killing.
Who's testing,
nobody's testing.
If we got Picos in your,

4
00:00:10.431 --> 00:00:11.264
you saw that your gifts,

5
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.330
the thing when you are a young guy and you're indulging in various ways to

6
00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:19.320
enhance your physical recovery and then you get off of that stuff,

7
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:22.830
you're going to have an adaptation period and that adaptation period,

8
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.180
I mean this is an issue.
It's,
hold on.
Why is it an issue?

9
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.620
It's a non issue.
Well,

10
00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:32.250
the issue is your performance is going to suffer if you're saying if you're

11
00:00:32.251 --> 00:00:35.490
going off it,
if you're on,
if you're on it and you get off of it.

12
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.400
[inaudible] he's a young guy.
If he's on it,
we're assuming he's on,

13
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.700
we don't know Gordon.
Yeah.
Oh I dunno.
Yeah.
What would you say?

14
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.050
You just have phenomenal genetics.
Yeah.
Okay.
All jokes aside,

15
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.960
if you do find someone though,
not him,
let's say someone else,

16
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.110
let's say he just was taking genetics,
someone else that does it.

17
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.190
If they do do it and they're doing it in an untested forum,
like like submission,

18
00:00:56.191 --> 00:01:00.150
grappling.
Correct.
Which most of you can get away with whatever you want.
Correct.

19
00:01:00.151 --> 00:01:05.151
Eddie Meyers generalists tests like speaking completely.

20
00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:09.450
Honestly,
we,
we know for a fact that some competitors are indulgent.

21
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.040
I don't know that.
Okay,
well I'll,
I'll say from,

22
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.920
I would say yes.
Okay.
I'm sure some are.
Okay.
Every sport there,

23
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.810
the radiologist she did too.
We know for sure some,
right.
You know what,

24
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.720
I don't know to accuse any individuals,

25
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.810
but we know for sure summer when when you do have that situation where someone

26
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:31.950
is on something and then they get off of something,

27
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.710
then you have this adaptation period where they're,

28
00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:36.920
their body's not producing testosterone as much anymore.

29
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.330
They're going to have to get on something else in order to kick start it back
up.

30
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.020
But you can do that.
You can do that.
But here's the thing too,

31
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.830
you know with this John Jones thinking the Pico granting and he did test

32
00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:49.800
positive now with Vata,
right,
and they still allow him to fight.
Well.

33
00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:53.910
Now let's say you are a Jujitsu guy who comes to the UFC and you did do stuff

34
00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:58.830
prior and those Pico,
Pico Graham's get flagged,
right?
What do you mean?

35
00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:00.930
Depends entirely on what you're,
what you're doing.

36
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.400
It depends entirely on who you are Joe.
Well No,
the with you sign it does not.

37
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.950
It depends entirely on what you're doing now.

38
00:02:07.951 --> 00:02:12.420
General terms in terms of whether or not you get punished twice for the same

39
00:02:12.421 --> 00:02:13.254
crime.

40
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.120
So if they can prove exactly the same way they approve with John the field,

41
00:02:17.121 --> 00:02:20.220
one of the things is happening is that the testing is getting far better so they

42
00:02:20.221 --> 00:02:24.090
can test you for stuff now that a year ago was absolutely impossible for sure.

43
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.080
So the threshold right now that they were saying this is where it's confusing to

44
00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:28.560
me,

45
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.560
the threshold that they tested John was supposed to be more stringent than Vada.

46
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.100
Yes.
And then the,
the night of the fight,
this is where it gets weird to me.

47
00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:41.910
The night of the fight to commission tested them all the same period,

48
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.260
same pice commission,
Usada and Vada all test him.
St Piss.

49
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.590
You cited,
didn't report anything.
Commission a report,
anything,
right?
Andy Foster,

50
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.180
clear him to fight.
But then Vata did.
Does he find it have better testing?

51
00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:56.610
Now it's all the same.
So how's that possible?

52
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.680
So you think shenanigans with sign a yes,
I think it's shanks.

53
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.870
Here's the other thing,
Joe.

54
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.960
Here's what no one talks about with you Sada in the rule book,

55
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.410
no matter if it's Picos,
whatever is,
if you get flagged,

56
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:13.680
it doesn't matter if it's from residue whatevers,

57
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.330
you cannot compete until that is out of your body.

58
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.270
That's the rule book black and white.
It doesn't say,

59
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:21.970
well if Spico grant just still good,
it doesn't matter.
Right?

60
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:25.240
But do you understand that he's not testing positive for the actual steroids?

61
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.450
Again,
that doesn't matter.
That tablet in the rubric,
it doesn't say that.

62
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.210
And the robots,
yeah.
It says if you test pop regardless,
what is you,

63
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.220
we can offer the metabolites.
We cannot grant you the license to compete.

64
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.420
Interesting.
Which is interesting to me.
Well now I'm not saying they should.

65
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.250
This is why they don't suspect this.
Why?

66
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:46.300
I honestly think why they're doing this because they don't know exactly how this

67
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:49.780
is happening.
I think they have their,
their theories,
which you know,

68
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:53.260
it works right now,
but ultimately they don't really know what's going on.

69
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.260
So if they were to suspend John and he's really not taking shit,

70
00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.230
who the fuck out of them?
So I think that's what's going well.
There's that.

71
00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:01.690
And then there's also this concept of double jeopardy that they've already

72
00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:05.320
punished him for having this stuff in a system is no indication that he has

73
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.410
recently taken it.
That's not the only hat,
Joe,
I understand.

74
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:10.030
But they're making the rules up as they go along,

75
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.630
which is an issue because if this was Corey Anderson,
phenomenal fighter,

76
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.070
not the same drawing powers.
John,
what happens at gala?
Scary argument.

77
00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:20.470
The evening,
if they're making it up as they go along,

78
00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:24.190
the parameters are changing.
So the ability to test things is changing.

79
00:04:24.191 --> 00:04:27.960
So if someone takes,
say you take creatine,

80
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.870
creatine is tainted and you have some forbidden substance in your system and

81
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:35.530
it's supposed to only stay in your system for six months if it's this certain

82
00:04:35.531 --> 00:04:38.140
stuff.
But now the testing gets better.

83
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.380
And so now instead of punishing you for something that you accidentally took,

84
00:04:43.931 --> 00:04:45.670
and then they test you and they say,
oh,

85
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.680
we can prove that you accidentally took it,

86
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.570
so we'll only going to give you a six on suspension.

87
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.570
But then after the six months is over,
they can still test it in you.
Why?

88
00:04:52.571 --> 00:04:55.000
Because the testing has gotten better.
Well,
what do they do now?

89
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.540
Because in the past they would've said,
well,
you've,
you've,
it's time served.

90
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.330
This is the only argument for the,

91
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.670
the John John's thing that makes sense is that you don't want,
you want,

92
00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:07.090
you don't want to punish a guy for something you've already punished him for.

93
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.730
If you've proven that it's,
this is what he took with it.
But the,

94
00:05:10.731 --> 00:05:15.140
at the rule book is it's,
you can only compete when you pass the tab.

95
00:05:15.141 --> 00:05:19.030
You bred this rule.
Yes.
Yeah,
yes.
Um,
yeah,
I had a discussion.

96
00:05:19.031 --> 00:05:20.860
This is what me and channel went back forth on text.

97
00:05:20.861 --> 00:05:22.450
But how does [inaudible] feel about this?

98
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.290
What does he think he shouldn't be allowed to compete?
Because his understanding,

99
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:29.470
because still no matter what you meant to take it or not,
right,
right,
right.

100
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.000
The rule is if you do not pass the test,
we can't grant,
you're licensed a fight.

101
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.290
That is the rules as explained to most all of the fighters separate.

102
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.080
The real problem would be is what if it's proven at some point in time,

103
00:05:41.081 --> 00:05:43.930
let's just say a big for riff.
What if rather,

104
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.620
what if it's proven one time that they can tell if you've ever taken anything

105
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.520
ever your whole life and they just disqualify anyone forever.

106
00:05:51.521 --> 00:05:54.940
Even if it's an actual shit test.
But if that happened,
I know it's a problem.

107
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.590
You won't have a sport.
This thing is a weird thing.
This pulse,

108
00:05:57.591 --> 00:05:59.900
here's where thing,
remember the metabolite.
They don't really understand.

109
00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:02.600
Here's where it's weird.
It makes no sense.
With our youth thought of testing,

110
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.770
do you sought a testing?
Their parameters are based off Olympic testing,
right?

111
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.350
Based off suspending guys two to four years.

112
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.800
You know how fucked up that is to do a fighter like Josh Barnett that,

113
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.170
so how small is your window?
It's not,
we're not the Olympics.

114
00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:17.450
Don't come every four years.
It's such a small window.

115
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:19.910
You suspend the guys for two to four years.

116
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.620
It's fucking silly question.

117
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.100
But if a guy does juice and he hurts someone and gets away with it and then you

118
00:06:28.101 --> 00:06:30.470
catch them like you've been trying to catch them,
then you catch him.

119
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.200
How much should you suspend him for?
Save.

120
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:38.210
You got a guy who's hired some Victor Kanye type individual back when victor was

121
00:06:38.421 --> 00:06:39.290
doing this with the,
uh,

122
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.890
the clear and he hired some guy and this guy gets him on some shit that no one

123
00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:43.724
knows what it is.

124
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.030
And he's just running through people and he's looking like Yo Romero and

125
00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:51.500
smashing people,
but pastor Bellevue and everybody's like,
I don't buy it.

126
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.430
Something's wrong.
And then one day you catch him,
you spent it for food.

127
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.640
So he shouldn't have a career ever again.
I don't know why she did it with years.

128
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.340
That's ridiculous.
Cause we're going based off the Olympic curriculum.

129
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.790
What's the real question is like how many people are cheating?
Right?

130
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.290
And what should the punishment be?

131
00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:09.380
Should it be based on how many people are cheating or she'd be based on the

132
00:07:09.381 --> 00:07:12.290
philosophy we're trying to get cheating out of the sport.
I don't know.

133
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.210
You ever going to get it out?
And as you saw the answer,

134
00:07:14.211 --> 00:07:16.760
cause obviously some shady.
Do you wish,

135
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.970
do you wish that the Japanese were super crazy strict about steroids back before

136
00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:26.380
pride?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
As a fan,
no.

137
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:29.350
I think you saw this wouldn't have happened.
Right?

138
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:34.460
So Anderson was making a point the other day in a rational point for letting a

139
00:07:34.461 --> 00:07:37.850
guy like him take something so that he could recover.
You know,

140
00:07:37.851 --> 00:07:39.770
cause he's 40 years old,
he still enjoys fighting,

141
00:07:39.771 --> 00:07:41.900
but his body doesn't produce testosterone in the right way anymore.

142
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.110
She's been trained,
he's beat.
Whether they tried that for a,

143
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.300
I remember they made that leap.
It was legal for awhile.
Fucked it all up.

144
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:52.670
And I don't mean over him and Pete or their green didn't have a testosterone use

145
00:07:52.941 --> 00:07:57.050
exemption.
Vito or did it,
did it legitimately Dan Henderson deal legitimate.

146
00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:00.480
So a few other guys that had a veto like,
all right,
well,
the

147
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:08.240
way works.
Yeah,
it's way worse.
And they don't test you,
buddy.

148
00:08:08.241 --> 00:08:11.250
No,
it was like,
it was totally legal.
Just like insiders knew.

149
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:16.520
We knew where he got it too.
I remember there was a guy in our gym,
they're like,

150
00:08:16.521 --> 00:08:18.980
he got TRT pass where like,
fuck man.
