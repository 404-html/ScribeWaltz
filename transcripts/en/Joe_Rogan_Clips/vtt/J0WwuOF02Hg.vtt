00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.960
Hello Freak bitches is like in this,

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.730
in this fucking gigantic audience full of people.
And this is Leonard Skinner.

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.840
The crazy thing is Leonard Skinner came out of Florida before people figured out

4
00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:17.220
Florida sucks.
See?
Cause when I was a kid,
Florida was cool.

5
00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:19.280
And if you listen to this,
you know what the fuck I'm talking about.

6
00:00:19.281 --> 00:00:22.350
If you live in Florida.
Yeah.
Florida state.
If you listen to this,

7
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.260
you know what I'm saying,
folks.
I used to live there.
I lived in Gainesville.

8
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.710
I lived there for a while,
but Florida back then.
What did,

9
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.300
nobody had figured out the Florida socks.

10
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.210
It was like Florida is the place to go to get away from this fucking winter.

11
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.830
And then I'll go down there and then I'll move.

12
00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:38.440
And then we realized like the salted dregs of the Weirdos.
Yeah.

13
00:00:38.441 --> 00:00:40.770
I don't want to see it if somebody had a tee shirt,

14
00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:43.560
because I grew up in Louisiana.
So many teachers said Florida on it.
Dude.

15
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:48.420
That was when they were somebody's,
you know?
Wow.
They made it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

16
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.370
They're really hang Florida.
Yeah.

17
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.090
Florida to Louisiana looked up to Florida.
Oh,

18
00:00:54.091 --> 00:00:58.050
definitely did because Florida had that coast land head pitchers of sunshine on

19
00:00:58.051 --> 00:01:00.190
their shirt.
That's right.
It's on sunshine.
Yeah.

20
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.310
Have that sign or people sitting out like an umbrella,
you know,
and mark a kid.

21
00:01:04.311 --> 00:01:08.110
They weren't infested with alligators yet either.
I don't think so.
I mean,

22
00:01:08.111 --> 00:01:10.350
we didn't,
you didn't worry about it as much then,
you know,

23
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:12.120
if he lost somebody to a animal or something.

24
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:16.530
Back then I felt like it wasn't as big of a deal as it is now.
Really?
Yeah.

25
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.890
And the eighties and nineties if you lost somebody to an animal or an animal

26
00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:24.090
bite,
it was more,
you know,
part of God's plan I think.

27
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.910
Whereas now it's like just something crazy that happened at Disney world,

28
00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:29.100
you know?
It was like the biggest thing ever.
Yeah.
That little kid,

29
00:01:29.101 --> 00:01:32.990
that's pretty fucked up.
It is a monster living at Disney.

30
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.080
This is how collar and people get,
they get so silly.
They're like,
well,

31
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.390
he is here before us.
This is,

32
00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:43.290
he's probably a 17 year old alligator and this is made lives.

33
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.440
This is peaceful environment.
And he made my eight a baby.
Yeah.
Oh yeah,

34
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.170
and you gotta be a nasty alligator.
If you sit in there and you get this,

35
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.080
probably been other choices came by,
you know,
there was probably a couple of,

36
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.890
you know,
young lovers that were out there by the water earlier and you waited.

37
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.840
You know,
you might not get a young lover though.

38
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.030
A young lover might fight back and there's two of them.
That's true.
I don't know.

39
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.140
Don't worry though.

40
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:09.900
They're pretty invulnerable and if you cut off an alligator's arm,

41
00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:12.900
it just grows back.
That's gangster.
That's as gangsters gets.

42
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.500
Go ahead and chop it off pitch.
I'll see you in a month with a new one.
Dude,

43
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.030
that's the,
that's the two pocket.
The animal kingdom.
Really,

44
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.893
when you think about it,

45
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.950
two fingers full of bullet holes headed to the ambulance and he's throwing up

46
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:27.060
his fingers and how gangster alligators that their arms are so short and they're

47
00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:28.290
just so capable.
Man,

48
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.710
I'm sure you've seen the video of that new one that they found in Florida that

49
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.140
is on a golf course and it's like 15 feet long.

50
00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:37.580
It's one of the biggest gators over film and these people are on the golf course

51
00:02:37.581 --> 00:02:40.020
then looking up.
But this gator,
excuse me,
could find a Jamie.

52
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.280
We can't show it on youtube.

53
00:02:41.281 --> 00:02:45.120
You have to find it on youtube because I got that cut be pulled off Facebook.

54
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.020
There's something happens when you have these animal videos in particular,

55
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.160
when they go on Facebook,
like people own those videos.
So when they go to uh,

56
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.820
look for,
uh,
they have like an algorithm,
I can find it.
And if it's on your page,

57
00:02:56.821 --> 00:03:00.610
I'll pull your whole page down.
Yeah,
they own this.
But so this,
so many films,

58
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:01.570
there's a couple of different angles.

59
00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:03.400
I it a bunch of people filling because it was so crazy.

60
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:05.830
So these people are all playing golf and they're in the foreground so he could

61
00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:08.740
see him like there it is.
Look at that fucking thing.
Yeah.

62
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.400
The look at the guys are real animal.
Huh?

63
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.150
You realize how big it is when you see a guy now watch how this guy walks in the

64
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:20.500
foreground and the guy,
when the guy gets a little,
doesn't it?

65
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.860
It looks fake.
It looks fake.
It looks fucking gigantic now.

66
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.500
Now you see how big it is.
Now you understand how big it is.

67
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:30.340
Could you see this guy like are you a,
are you kidding me?

68
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.400
And they estimated it's somewhere around 15 feet.
And did they catch it?

69
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.350
I don't think so man.
They found it again.
They found that again in a pond.

70
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.300
See if you can find it.
Um,
they,

71
00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:44.350
they re rediscovered this a alligator in a pond.

72
00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:47.110
I think that was the,
um,
I hope,
I like the title of the video.

73
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.270
Maybe they're making a comeback.
Dude,

74
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.400
I hope something good comes in attacks at some animal.
Dude,
I'm ready for it.

75
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.060
Everybody to fight.
Don't fight alligators,
man.
You don't want to fight them.
Well,

76
00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.190
I'll get out there and do something,
man.
There's this dude that I have a,

77
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.940
I've had on my podcast before,
but he said his name is Jim Shockey.

78
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.970
He's a very famous hunter from Canada and they hired him to go to a,

79
00:04:08.971 --> 00:04:12.130
a certain river in Africa.
I think it was the Congo,
but I'm not sure.

80
00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:14.290
It might've been the denial.
Anyway,
he had to go,

81
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.040
he went down there at to kill some crocodiles that were eating people.

82
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.860
It is one of the craziest videos,
man.
You'd go there and the,
these,

83
00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:24.470
these villagers like everyone's got to stump,
right?

84
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.540
Everyone's missing an arm or a hand or they got chunk bitten out of their chest.

85
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:32.080
It's crazy when you look at these poor people and they're all just living in

86
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:36.040
fear.
And while he was down there,
a woman got taken.
Oh yeah.

87
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.700
They were up river looking for these killer crocodiles to try to shoot him.

88
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:40.390
And uh,

89
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.600
one of the women was washing clothes and she just got yanked right out of the

90
00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:47.600
water.
God,
that'd be the worst to what was really scary,
man.

91
00:04:47.601 --> 00:04:51.310
And seeing the readout laundry.
Oh yeah,
right.
Just he'd wash underwear.

92
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.500
Seeing the reaction of the people that were wailing,
just wailing,
crying,

93
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.740
you know,
because it wasn't just like they lost someone.
It's like,
God,

94
00:04:59.741 --> 00:05:03.430
they lost another person.
It's like,
that woman's gone now forever.

95
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.170
She was consumed,
consumed by a monster like that.

96
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.700
That is their actual existence.
Damn.
Sitting by a river that they need.

97
00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:17.701
It's water for life and the water is infested by monsters who are actually

98
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.520
actively targeting them for food.
Yeah.
God crazy.

99
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.450
That'd be like if somebody's like there was a killer in Walmart and they just

100
00:05:25.451 --> 00:05:26.530
didn't know who or where.

101
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.460
It was constantly like lions would jump out while you were eating at Walmart.

102
00:05:30.461 --> 00:05:34.390
Yeah.
What were you buying?
Food.
Ethylene.
Yeah.
Yeah,
we got it pretty easy man.

103
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:39.100
You know those people must be so interesting like people that live under that

104
00:05:39.101 --> 00:05:42.340
kind of pressure,
like their view of life and we can understand their language.

105
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:43.990
I bet they have like a,

106
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.500
you know like you'll listen to like read like ancient works of literature,

107
00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.100
ancient poetry,
stuff like that.

108
00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:52.990
And you think about it like these are people that are,

109
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.470
we're going through a war like the ancient Greeks and the ancient Romans.

110
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.240
Like you would read their words to go,
well,
this is fascinating.

111
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:00.230
We know it's being translated.

112
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:03.800
This is the words of someone who's gone through like sword war.
Yeah.

113
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.420
Back when they would fight with arrows and shit and swords and catapults and the

114
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:12.530
intensity of life.
Back then when death was just around every corner,

115
00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:17.390
it was everywhere.
It must be so,
so intense to talk to someone like that.

116
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.000
You should fly in a pygmy or something.
You thought about that?
No,
but I have,
um,

117
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.410
had my friend Justin Wren,

118
00:06:24.411 --> 00:06:28.460
who has been with the pygmies in the Congo is for like many,
many years.

119
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.570
He goes and builds wells for them.
Why?
He's over there for months at a time.

120
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:36.650
He's had malaria three times.
He's got to come out again soon.
He just texted me.

121
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.600
I got to text him.
We're going to find a date.

122
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:39.870
And I used to be in the wishing well,

123
00:06:39.871 --> 00:06:43.880
I used to be in the well business a little bit.
Not uh,
wishing wells,
mostly the,

124
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:45.500
not water wells,
but I worked for this.

125
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.800
This is made by a pygmy in the Congo out of a nail.

126
00:06:48.801 --> 00:06:51.720
It's a little knife that a Justin brought me.
Wow.
Yeah.
They,

127
00:06:51.721 --> 00:06:54.920
they take these nails and there's one over there to see that nail right there on

128
00:06:54.921 --> 00:06:56.780
the desk.
That's what it looks like.
The Hammer,

129
00:06:56.781 --> 00:06:59.630
these nails out and they turn them into knives.

130
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:05.110
See that starts out a nail that they find a why and they they pound it down and

131
00:07:05.631 --> 00:07:08.690
sharpen it and turn it into a knife.

132
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.990
It you'd have history came back if history struck back to we would,

133
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.530
I wouldn't make it.
I wouldn't meet with Megan.
I wouldn't make it long.
Ah,

134
00:07:15.531 --> 00:07:19.040
you'd be fine.
I don't know.
I'm not prepared for ball.
You would be though.

135
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.850
You people are adaptable.
You're smart dude.
Theo Vaughn,
I would lead,

136
00:07:22.851 --> 00:07:25.820
I would think a little bit.
I would to death.
I'd lay low in the beginning.
Yeah.

137
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.610
You know,
like somebody doesn't pick my battles.
Dude.

138
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.140
You'd have to kill somebody immediately.

139
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:31.790
You have to find the first person in your group,

140
00:07:31.791 --> 00:07:35.030
the week person and kill them in front of everybody else.
Yeah.

141
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:42.380
Like you can't just stand there.
Yeah.
He can't kill some dude.

142
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.740
Well think about that man.
You can't stand there and is be in a comedy.

143
00:07:44.741 --> 00:07:47.000
You know everybody's chatting group huddle and everybody's like,

144
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.510
you got to take somebody out right then cause that's going to show your

145
00:07:50.511 --> 00:07:51.830
dominance a hundred year.

146
00:07:51.831 --> 00:07:54.890
I mean it's going at least going to show like this dude is going to do
something.

147
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:59.330
I see what you're saying.
But I think if you think ahead,
you would think,

148
00:07:59.331 --> 00:08:00.200
well no,

149
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.930
then they're going to think that he's got arbitrarily gonna always kill the

150
00:08:02.931 --> 00:08:03.681
weakest person.

151
00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:06.110
Eventually it's going to get to know one because there's going to be,

152
00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:07.100
the next week is person.

153
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.400
That guy is dead now and the next week like who's to decide whether or not

154
00:08:10.401 --> 00:08:12.710
you're weak or you're not weak.
If you were going to do that,

155
00:08:12.711 --> 00:08:16.760
the person wouldn't have to be either a terrible person who is victimizing other

156
00:08:16.761 --> 00:08:21.710
people.
Right.
Or they would have to have attacked first who'd have to be,

157
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.980
or they would have to have been such a piece of shit that people were rooting

158
00:08:24.981 --> 00:08:28.930
for you.
Like somebody who was real chatty and you just asked them did.

159
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.810
There's no way I'm so kind of survive like,
uh,
like uh,
you know,

160
00:08:32.811 --> 00:08:36.950
the second coming of of the universe and some dudes chatty and my group,
Bro,

161
00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.310
that's not,
especially if like he fucks up some hunting parties.

162
00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:43.490
You're out there with sneaking up on a pig and he's like,
oh my God,

163
00:08:43.491 --> 00:08:47.510
it's so hot out.
You fucking the pig runs away and everybody's hungry.

164
00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.290
Yeah.
Sadie would be the first man I think about that kind of stuff.

165
00:08:51.291 --> 00:08:53.580
Like if a plane crashed,
I already know I'm planning ahead.

166
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.910
Did I'd eat a Vietnamese guy.
Wow.

167
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.270
Cause it's easier to start or move if you attack somebody bigger.

168
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.180
If you eat somebody bigger in front of other people,
it's going to alarm people.

169
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.380
But you,
you gotta eat a small person.
So stature is important.

170
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.320
I think if you come down a Viet,
people aren't gonna be that upset at you.

171
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.640
What it means people are going to be super upset.
What are you talking about?

172
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:18.390
Tony's dad.
Yeah,
their sacrifice.
They're more understanding of things.

173
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:23.100
Dude,
this is a character you're playing.
No,
but if you eat a black dude,

174
00:09:23.101 --> 00:09:26.190
you eat a black lady and her family's there,
they're going to be pissed.

175
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.500
So you think at Vietnamese person,
we'll let you slide.

176
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.520
I think that they'd be much more forgiving over a couple of day period.
I think,

177
00:09:32.521 --> 00:09:36.990
uh,
like our relatives.
You don't think so?
Honestly,
one thing,
no,
I don't think so.

178
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:40.260
I definitely think there'd be super pissed at you,
especially modernized ones.

179
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:44.320
But what is interesting is like Vietnam was one of the few places where,
um,

180
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:48.840
Americans can go back to Vietnam and they don't seem to hold any grudge at all.

181
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.490
Exhibit a
exhibit a man.

182
00:09:53.491 --> 00:09:55.460
Honestly it will.

183
00:09:55.620 --> 00:10:00.620
Asian people in general are just much more forgiving and understanding it seems

184
00:10:00.781 --> 00:10:03.860
like after like,
I think,
I mean I don't have much,
I think,

185
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.500
I think that's a giant generalization.
It probably is.
You know,

186
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:12.150
I mean I did a fast for like four days and then it was at the best buy and um,

187
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.960
and I'll remember this Vietnamese guy was trying to help me out and I couldn't

188
00:10:15.961 --> 00:10:16.471
even hear him.

189
00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:21.180
I was so hungry and I couldn't ended up fast for four days.

190
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.210
You're trying to prove,
I don't know,
man.

191
00:10:24.211 --> 00:10:26.310
I was probably just dealing with some stuff and I'm just trying to find a

192
00:10:26.311 --> 00:10:28.620
different way to handle it,
you know?
Right.
Um,

193
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.400
and then I remember this Vietnamese guy and I remember thinking,

194
00:10:32.401 --> 00:10:35.160
if everybody turned the other way for a second,
I could eat this young fella.

195
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:41.220
His name was Ben actually over here in Westwood.
Um,
but,

196
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:45.180
and I'd never thought,
God,
it's so ridiculous.
Well,
I mean,
but here's the thing.

197
00:10:45.181 --> 00:10:46.650
I never thought that before.

198
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:50.310
So you only thought you got to the verge of cannibalism after just four days.

199
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.840
Yeah.
Damn.
How much weight did you lose?
I probably lost about four pounds pounds.

200
00:10:54.841 --> 00:10:59.760
I needed to know,
but I got clear,
man.
I could,
and I could hear,
swear to God,

201
00:10:59.761 --> 00:11:02.820
y'all could hear somebody fold a piece of bread from 80 feet away,
bro.

202
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.480
I was so hungry,
dude.

203
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:09.060
I could hear a fucking skittle hit the semen across the street.
I really could,

204
00:11:09.061 --> 00:11:09.894
man.

205
00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:18.250
<v 1>Yeah.</v>
