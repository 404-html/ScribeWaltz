1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.750
It's not as bad as him.
I've passed your car,
you only got that strap,
you know,

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.620
you're moving around and banging around in there and in the race car you were in

3
00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:08.780
there pretty tight.
Yeah.

4
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.960
Do you feel weird when you're in a passenger car too is for the lack of support,

5
00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:15.420
lack of support and safety?
You know,
I,

6
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.190
I do because compared to way the way our cup cars are now or the race cars are

7
00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:23.910
now,
man were cocooned in their,
the seat and everything.
The headrest,
you got six,

8
00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:28.230
seven point harness.
I mean in the street car you really just got the strap.

9
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:32.370
I mean it's um,
uh,
certainly,
uh,

10
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.180
you know,
and more,

11
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.690
I'm much more cautious as I get older on the highway and,
and people like,

12
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:40.560
hey man,
how do you do that?

13
00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:44.310
How do you drive on how you drive a race car and then go 45,
55 on the road?

14
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.720
And it's really easy actually,
you know,

15
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.560
just kinda chill out all your fast driving out of the way.

16
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.080
When I was younger I was getting speeding tickets all the time.

17
00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:56.460
But when as I got older I just didn't care to be in a hurry anymore.
Yeah,

18
00:00:56.461 --> 00:00:58.620
I would figure the way you drive for a living,

19
00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:01.950
you just get it out of your system.
Yeah,
plenty of.

20
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.990
I had plenty and plenty of high speed action and high jinks on the race track.

21
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:11.520
I don't,
I calmed down the road.
What kind of car do you drive in real life?
Well,

22
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:15.420
it's funny,
I um,
uh,
uh,
just bought a brand new Silverado.

23
00:01:15.421 --> 00:01:17.490
I hadn't bought a truck and a long time.
I had,

24
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.520
I still have my old Silverado about what it's about Oh four oh six.

25
00:01:20.521 --> 00:01:24.150
But there's new one.
Uh,
I like a lot of new ones are bad.

26
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.940
I didn't like the old ones that much.
They just look kind of basic.

27
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.300
The new ones are really sweet looking,
the character lines and the body lines.

28
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.230
It's just a good looking truck.
So I bought that.

29
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.853
Um,
but my,

30
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
what I was driving before that I got a 48 a pickup truck and uh,

31
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.650
it's all rough as hell on the outside and um,

32
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.240
original faded all messy and ugly looking,

33
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.540
but it's got a Vortec motor and good drive train in it drives good but it's easy

34
00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:56.010
to work on and I just love fooling with it.

35
00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:59.670
I took the original Binks bench seat out and put these old bucket seats in from

36
00:01:59.671 --> 00:02:03.060
an 80 a Chevy blazer and a,

37
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.180
so I made it comfortable and just the way I wanted it.
So I drive,

38
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.210
I drove that a lot this summer until I got this new truck and I got a 76 Chevy

39
00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:15.380
Laguna that I love to drive.
Yeah.

40
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.220
That thing just kind of floats,
floats down the road,
man.

41
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.120
It's a dark midnight blue tinted windows and just a really cool,

42
00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:28.860
because I love the 70s in the style of the cars in the 70s even though kind of

43
00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:32.610
the bigger ones,
like in the late seventies,
like the four 42 Oldsmobile cutlass,

44
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.070
those big,
big,
big cars.

45
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.740
There's something about those guys that I really did cause that your car,

46
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.820
that's my car right there.
Yeah.
I love that thing man.

47
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.800
I had a 1973 Chevelle.
Yeah.
That reminds me of that kind of body style.

48
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.320
That's it.
I got it for 42.

49
00:02:49.321 --> 00:02:54.320
That's sort of the sister that also bill for 42 that's red and um,

50
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.650
kind of the same.
Tended wouldn't same.
I did the same wheels,
same tire,
same tent,

51
00:02:58.651 --> 00:02:59.200
same.

52
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.560
I put a spoiler like a NASCAR style spoiler on the back of the front and kind of

53
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:06.820
look because those cars were big in Nascar.
Uh,
so those,

54
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:10.780
those cars don't get as much love as the 16th muscle cars.
Well,
we'll get there.

55
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.100
I think as we get older.
That what cool gets older.
Reemay yeah.

56
00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:19.890
Like I mean nothing.
I mean this camera,
the 67 Camaro,
those cards if 50.
Yeah.

57
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.970
Yeah.
I got a 67.
I thought I had a 69,
but uh,
like the 55 shit,

58
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:28.390
all those things will always hold their rightful place in history.

59
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:32.560
But these cars,
like that car right there or that wasn't very cool.

60
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.750
10 15,
20 years ago.
No,
but as we get older,
that car becomes cool,

61
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.010
you know,
and,
and,
and you know,

62
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.160
one day we'll be driving around in like a 85 pickup trucks going,
man,
this thing,

63
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.520
so,
so awesome.
So yeah.
Thanks.

64
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.530
So I may know about that.

65
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.870
I just think that the car might just be cool cause you own it.
I don't know.

66
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.410
I think that it's got these old character lines,
man.
And I really like,

67
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.330
it does have old care.
You know what's interesting?
I was,

68
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:04.800
I was just talking to a friend of mine about this when in 1970 uh,

69
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.940
my mom bought a barracuda.
Yeah.

70
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.170
And when I was in high school in 1981 I was a freshman in high school and she

71
00:04:11.171 --> 00:04:14.770
had this Barracuda and it was like a classic car and there was like a classic

72
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:18.430
muscle car.
Right.
But like that's the only 11 years old.
Yeah.

73
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.330
Like if you had a car today from 2007 well,
there,
yeah.

74
00:04:23.331 --> 00:04:28.210
You wouldn't be a car class car.
Yeah.
You're right.
It's weird.
It is weird.

75
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.931
It is weird.

76
00:04:28.931 --> 00:04:33.400
Like a 1969 when I was in high school in 1969 which is only an 11 year old car

77
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.740
was amazing.
Like whoa.
People would stop and stare at it.
Dude.

78
00:04:37.741 --> 00:04:39.400
Look at that 69 Camaro.

79
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.010
I got an 88 s 10 that was the first pickup truck I owned or had,

80
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.730
that was like what the car I got when I was 16 years old and I got one and

81
00:04:48.731 --> 00:04:52.610
restored it and a,
which was a terrible investment.
But um,

82
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.130
it makes sense for me because it,
you know,

83
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.380
because it was my first truck and I didn't think anybody would give a shit about

84
00:04:59.381 --> 00:05:00.940
it.
Right.
Cause it's an Stn,

85
00:05:00.941 --> 00:05:05.670
it's like the bottom of the barrel and pickup trucks for Chevrolet in 1988 and,

86
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.470
and,
but I drive that thing around and people were like,
wow,

87
00:05:08.471 --> 00:05:12.040
that's the cleanest as 10 I've seen in,
you know,
1520 years.

88
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.390
That's it right there.
Oh,
that's a nice car.
And so,

89
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.670
I mean that's what's something about seeing one of those,
it's in great shape.

90
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.730
Yeah,
I like that it made it through.
Yeah,
there's not many of them left.

91
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.180
I mean for,
for good reason.
But what was your first car?

92
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.680
My first car was a 73 Chevelle,

93
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.430
a 70 Chevelle Chevelles good car man.
Oh I love,

94
00:05:33.431 --> 00:05:35.750
she's so would you buy a civil,

95
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.790
would you get a 73 and restore it to what would get a 76 my favorite.

96
00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:42.280
You're 69 and 70 are my favorite years.

97
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.580
I go back and forth between 69 70 with Chevelles.
Both amazing years.
Yeah.

98
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.870
Yeah.
I liked those cars.
They're,
they're uh,
they're a big muscle car.
Yards.

99
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.330
A big ride.
It's bigger than the Camaro.
Yeah.

100
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.720
I have a 1969 Nova.
Really?
Yeah.
I would just like a smaller,
yeah,

101
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.600
like that right there.
Ooh Daddy looking car.

102
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.020
That is as classic and American muscle cars you get.

103
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.620
It's a 1970 with silver with black stripes.

104
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.300
Camo and I used to race Novas my dad raced a Nova.
Yeah.
No,

105
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.050
I liked novas cause the light is a light car and cause you know,

106
00:06:18.051 --> 00:06:21.920
you put a big engine in it and new suspension and you know,

107
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.500
I have a,
a Nova,

108
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.280
a wagon that I just bought a 66.
Oh Wow.

109
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.220
That's my next project,
um,
about it from a buddy for five grand and um,

110
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.690
it's in,
it's,
it's pretty bad shape,
but I'm going to,
that's my next project.

111
00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:43.130
Soon as I get some time I had this little girl,
um,
Allah and she's six months.

112
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.320
Um,
so it's kind of made it tough to do any kind of project with Greg.
Thanks.

113
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.860
It's awesome.
But it does,
uh,
it does eat up a lot.

114
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.870
Everything is on the side right now and it will be

115
00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.080
forever
until they move out.

116
00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:03.380
And then it's still a little bit on the side cause you got a call and check on

117
00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:08.210
them.
Yeah.
It's awesome though.
Yeah.
It is this amazing.
I couldn't,

118
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.360
it's like getting married and having a kid and all that stuff is not nothing

119
00:07:13.431 --> 00:07:14.210
like I thought it'd be.
