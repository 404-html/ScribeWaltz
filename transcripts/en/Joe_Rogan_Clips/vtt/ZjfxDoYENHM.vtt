1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.360
Man.
I mean,
it just seems like there's so many promising things.

2
00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:06.810
It would be really fascinating if you could document that you could take one

3
00:00:06.811 --> 00:00:11.730
person.
It was like a,
a wealthy man in his mid to late sixties.

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.380
Yeah.
Well there's this four inch element in anti aging.
In fact,

5
00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:17.730
I don't even like the term anti aging.

6
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:22.731
It's what do you like longevity research or we're about to announce,

7
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.540
uh,
maybe this is a sneak preview for everybody.
Uh,

8
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.730
an academy for aging research of the,
the top,

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.920
I think 20 scientists in the world are banding together to,
to,
uh,

10
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.250
produce white papers and opinions.
Um,
but yeah,

11
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.340
we call it longevity research.
And so anti aging is,

12
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.910
is more that the botox and that kind of stuff that we don't want anything to do

13
00:00:45.911 --> 00:00:48.690
with.
But that's nonsense.
It's not really anti aging.

14
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.250
You're not doing anything about aging.

15
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.340
You just freezing your skin so it doesn't move.
That is,

16
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.990
that to me is one of the weirder things,
especially with men.
When I see a man,

17
00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:00.680
his forehead doesn't move,
I want to smack them in the mouth.
Like,

18
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.980
what's wrong with you?
Sir,
how dare you spark.
It's just,

19
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.330
it's not,
it's a,

20
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.770
it's not like botox or fillers or any of those things.

21
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.990
You're not doing anything for your health or your actual real vitality.

22
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.000
You're just weirdly doing something cosmetic.
Right?
Yes,
you are.

23
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.570
Um,

24
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.220
and though I think their defense is you feel better if you look better and

25
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.070
psychologically it might help.
I don't think they look better though.

26
00:01:29.071 --> 00:01:33.720
They just look different.
Yeah.
Well that's the problem.
It is true.
Um,

27
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.700
yeah,
I don't spend a lot of time thinking about the cosmetic industry,
uh,

28
00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:42.810
for obvious reasons.
I'm trying to save humanity and,
and improve the planet.

29
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.040
Um,
I actually,
I do think we will,
we would be judged as a,
uh,

30
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.380
as a species if an alien came down and they said,

31
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.820
you're shooting botulism in your face with fries.
Right,
exactly.
You are a weird,

32
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.970
you're not allowed in the club of advanced species.
Well,

33
00:01:56.971 --> 00:02:00.750
would that would only be one thing that we are weird from.
Yeah.
You know,

34
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.570
but what would,
what would they ask you that?
Well,
they'd ask us,

35
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.830
have you figured out the speed of light?

36
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.910
They would ask me why I have drawings all over my arm.
You know?

37
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.620
Now they might appreciate art maybe,
but like they'd be like,

38
00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:16.110
why didn't you just get it?
And there's wash it off or something.

39
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.290
Why you have to get it drilled in your scans too.
That's coming.

40
00:02:19.291 --> 00:02:20.430
But I think what did that,

41
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:23.940
one of the most important questions they'd ask to tell if we are an advanced

42
00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:28.350
nation or advanced species is,
have you figured out aging yet?

43
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.210
Mm.
Right.
Deterioration.
Yeah.
And you know what?
We're so pathetic as a species.

44
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.290
Our answer would be,
you mean that's a thing?
You can do something about that.

45
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.110
And they're like,
come back in a thousand years.
