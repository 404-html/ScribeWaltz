WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.920
And it was using the bodybuilding industry for a long time because when you

2
00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:07.160
inject it,
it gives you,
uh,

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.230
like this amazing Tan and they call it tad stimulates your melanin on that

4
00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:17.700
fucking show that was turning black.
She believed that she was,
yeah.

5
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.110
Then the wrong skin.

6
00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:23.040
So she was shooting something and do her body and she got black like Congo
black.

7
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.150
Well,
I,
I tried it out.
I tried it out for about a week.
You tried to get black?

8
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.360
No,
I didn't try to get black.
Just wants us,

9
00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:33.030
wanted to see what happened to the Tan.
I started to get some freckles.

10
00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:38.031
But the side effect of this is you get massive boners that last a really

11
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.810
annoyingly long time.
So you can't say no,

12
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:47.340
but people will use,
this is like almost light,
like a,
an Ed type of drug.

13
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.070
But it,
and I don't even know the mechanism of action.

14
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.800
Like I don't know how it's even working.
Well,
it's giving you a black,

15
00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:56.250
so basically you get it.
Yeah.
You get a Tan and boners.
Yeah.

16
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.080
I don't know.
That's not how you would administer millennial talent.
She's,

17
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.000
she's doing some kind of like a volume.

18
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.960
What is that thing that she's doing with the syringe?
What?

19
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.770
That looks like a caulking gun.
Like what is she doing?
Picture.
I don't know.
Yeah,

20
00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:12.180
that bitch isn't another type of thing.

21
00:01:12.181 --> 00:01:15.990
Like the Kardashians are doing to their ass cheeks like fillers.

22
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.000
I don't know what they're doing throughout ass there.

23
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:20.220
They're doing something that seems like,
well,

24
00:01:20.221 --> 00:01:22.620
it's very popular with the young people these days.

25
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.700
They're taking fat out a certain parts of their body and putting it in their
ass.

26
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.330
Right.
It's not,
I don't,
well let's,

27
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.320
we should find out what is he getting diaper.
But just Google.

28
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.830
How are women today?
How are Instagram models getting diaper?

29
00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:40.740
But I'm curious because that's what it is.
It's what you're using their own.

30
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.370
So they're taking their fat from somewhere else on their body.
Yes.
Injecting.

31
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.580
I know that some people do that.
We should do that.

32
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.730
Cabs that way we could start an Instagram calf channel.
No,

33
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.290
I don't want fat calves.

34
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.950
Will the jiggling walk like a girl's butt while he's pulling that up?

35
00:01:55.951 --> 00:01:59.790
What kind of coffee is this?
Uh,
this is black rifle coffee.
It's good.
Yeah,

36
00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:03.390
it's good stuff.
Yeah.
I figured out something.

37
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.730
Thank you by the way,
for hooking me up with trigger.
Oh,
that's great.
Right.

38
00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:08.750
I will just trigger Timberline's.

39
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.320
So those are the Shit I've been making a coffee rub for the style coffee rub

40
00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:13.801
before.
Yes.

41
00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:18.150
I have trigger has her own coffee rub you well they have their own I love you

42
00:02:18.151 --> 00:02:22.230
trigger but that I sometimes never know what all is in some of these spices and

43
00:02:22.231 --> 00:02:23.710
rubs.
You know,
they'll add some time,
you know,

44
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.250
Maltodextrin and show her and stuff.
Yeah,
there's some sugar in there.

45
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.990
So I find grind,
grind,
grind coffee and I mixed that with black cone assault,

46
00:02:30.991 --> 00:02:32.580
Cayenne pepper and Paprika.

47
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.860
And you can just make that rub his thick as you want.
Put that on the Ribeye.

48
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.160
And I've almost switched completely from doing my,

49
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.280
my stove top sear followed by the quick broil on either side to do in like a one

50
00:02:47.251 --> 00:02:50.880
and a half to two hour smoke in the trigger with that coffee rub on.

51
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.880
And they're just finishing it on the grill with the tracker.
Yeah,
I did a uh,
uh,

52
00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.750
uh,
what,
what would you call it?
A prime rib,
you know,
like,

53
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:01.540
so instead of eat,

54
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.140
it's basically ribeye roast and I did one on the trigger and I cooked it for

55
00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:09.910
like four hours at 220 degrees.
Holy Shit.

56
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.260
You smoked it four hours.
Yes,
yes.
And that it had,

57
00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:18.400
I used the traders scrub smoke at that temperature.

58
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.680
This is a super smoke setting at two 25 and below press the super smoke button

59
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.420
and it constantly infuses this pump of smoke.
Like,
like it's like,
whoa.

60
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.210
I've never tried super smoke at that high of a temperature.

61
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.520
Good delicious dude.
And the,

62
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.750
but the Trager prime rib rub,
I know it has sugar in it.

63
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:40.150
It's taste too delicious to not,
but holy Shit,

64
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:41.530
when it's in there for three and a half,

65
00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:43.570
four hours and it has that crossed on it.

66
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.530
There's some lord some about that long smoke.
Have you tried to beer?

67
00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:51.140
Can chicken beer can chicken?
I've,

68
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.110
I've tried a bunch of different rubs on that,
but just,

69
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:56.890
just core salt and black pepper works fine for the beer.
Can Chicken.
Yeah.

70
00:03:56.891 --> 00:04:00.080
Empty about half of the beer can you open up the beer can,

71
00:04:00.081 --> 00:04:03.280
but then you poke a couple extra holes in the top so you get more of the steam

72
00:04:03.281 --> 00:04:05.650
so they inside of the chicken gets even more moist.

73
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.490
But then when I figured out is if you use like a little little scalpel or exacto

74
00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:12.940
knife and you cut open the skin of the chicken around the outside a little bit

75
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.830
and you stuff that with pads of butter and then you do your smoke pads of butter

76
00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:21.460
and said the chicken that the skin gets crispy,

77
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.380
like super crispy.
And so you just,
it's like,
I think it's like an hour,

78
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.180
an hour and a half.
He Cook that one and he can't,

79
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.370
you can't smoke that one very successful.

80
00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:32.980
Like you want to run the grill with the smoke on but you can't super smoke.

81
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:37.300
It didn't seem to work so well,
but that beer can chicken.
That's fricken amazing.

82
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.530
Whoever figured that out,

83
00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:43.240
whatever drunk figured that out as the God damn genius do.
It works.

84
00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:44.470
But I've wondered before,

85
00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:48.790
if there are other things that will work even better than beer.
We've got Jamie,

86
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.850
it says in most cases what I'm finding is either Brazilian butt lift or just

87
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:56.590
like a fat graft or fat injection.

88
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.070
But there have been cases where I'm seeing that they had to get an injection

89
00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:02.350
taken out within weeks because it was causing a problem.

90
00:05:02.351 --> 00:05:04.150
So like I don't know if that was just fat,

91
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.610
but you got the fat put in then you have to get a take it back out.

92
00:05:06.611 --> 00:05:09.610
Yeah cause they were gonna they were dying.
It'd be a bummer.
Great.

93
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.940
And then you have this fucking war zone of an APP.

94
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.480
Most of that is like leaves,
some barks,

95
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.100
a Syrian few POCs.
Airstrip.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No more.
No more.

96
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:21.934
G string,

97
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.460
32 people died supposedly in 2017 from wonderful.
Yeah.
Yeah.

98
00:05:27.461 --> 00:05:29.950
That's like the same amount of people that died from coconuts falling on their

99
00:05:29.951 --> 00:05:34.900
head.
That's a fucking ridiculous way to die.
You know?
And here's the thing,

100
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.450
the,
what they're doing is not aesthetically pleasing because it violates your

101
00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:43.660
sensibilities.
Cause you look at the ass and you look at the legs and you go,

102
00:05:43.661 --> 00:05:46.990
what's wrong here?
How did you get that ass with those legs?

103
00:05:46.991 --> 00:05:48.190
They don't go together.

104
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.090
Like if you look at like a cross fitters legs,

105
00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:56.020
like one of them powerful gals with a big butt,

106
00:05:56.021 --> 00:06:00.740
but they also have to see with those high neon compression socks.
Ooh,
la La.

107
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.140
It looks right.
It fits.
Like if the ass fits the thigh,

108
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.050
it's not entirely disproportionate when the ass pumps out and then he goes to

109
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.840
these little toothpick legs.
He like,
that's gross.
That's weird.
You know,

110
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.790
like it's comparable.
That's a real ass.
That's a real Instagram.

111
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:23.360
We may be evolving as a species to find these type of things.

112
00:06:23.361 --> 00:06:24.410
More attractive though,

113
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.070
because that's the whole idea was social media is you get a dopamine hit every

114
00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:32.870
time you click on the little blue notification button or you look at a new

115
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:33.261
photo.

116
00:06:33.261 --> 00:06:36.800
So maybe we're just going to eventually develop a real appreciation for that

117
00:06:36.801 --> 00:06:39.520
type of symmetry.
No,
we'll redefine.
All right.

118
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.940
Know what true human symmetry is incorrect.
It doesn't look as good.

119
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.440
It just doesn't look as good.
It's a,
it's a cheap fix your squats.
Yeah.

120
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.510
Get your ass to the gym.
Girls.
To some dead lifts.
