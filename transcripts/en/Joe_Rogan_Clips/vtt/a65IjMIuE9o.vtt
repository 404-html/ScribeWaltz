1
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.720
Speaking of blood fucking let's talk about you sorta yeah.
Without the loop.

2
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.810
Yeah.
We were,
um,
we,
we started this podcast.

3
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.480
I'm talking about what we talked about your,

4
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:16.860
your situation with Brendan Schaub and I had talked about your situation where

5
00:00:16.861 --> 00:00:18.690
you a war,

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.960
you tested positive from a tainted supplement,

7
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.560
like legitimately tested positive from a tainted supplement.

8
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.440
You were cleared,
but this whole process was a goat rope.
Yeah.

9
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.180
Right.
It took a long time to work out and you didn't feel like you were fairly

10
00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:36.560
treated.
Yeah.

11
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.910
<v 1>Not In the least.
It,
it,
uh,
it started one way,
then took a fucking curve.</v>

12
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.950
What happened?
Well,
so did you take a,

13
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.600
I took a supplement that had tribulus in it.
That's all.

14
00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:49.870
It was just a Chinese herb.

15
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.590
<v 0>It's a Chinese herb that stimulates testosterone and by the way,
barely work.</v>

16
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.000
<v 1>Yeah.
It's not,
it's not a,
it's not going to turn you into superman or anything.</v>

17
00:00:58.001 --> 00:00:59.350
Like if you get more sleep,

18
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.990
it's better for your testosterone production than Tribulus.

19
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.500
So it's just tribulus is all it was.
And,
uh,

20
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.510
they in it,
the,
the supplement itself as it turns out,

21
00:01:10.511 --> 00:01:14.740
was contaminated with a sarms called [inaudible].

22
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.810
But when I say contaminated,

23
00:01:16.811 --> 00:01:21.460
I mean like it had such trace amounts that the people that did the lab testing

24
00:01:21.461 --> 00:01:24.880
on it said,
well,
it's clearly just contamination because this wouldn't help you.

25
00:01:24.881 --> 00:01:26.530
This wouldn't do anything for you.

26
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.720
<v 0>And those,
let's explain how that happens.
A lot of these places,</v>

27
00:01:29.721 --> 00:01:34.520
I know this for a fact because I am one of the owners of on it on it is a third

28
00:01:34.521 --> 00:01:39.521
party tested company where we get our stuff tested by an independent party to

29
00:01:39.831 --> 00:01:41.570
make sure that there's nothing funky with it.

30
00:01:41.571 --> 00:01:44.040
But we've had some issues in the past with stuff being in our,

31
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.240
with our earliest formulations of Alpha brain and weren't supposed to be in

32
00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:51.650
there.
And what it comes from is you buy your ingredients from a company.

33
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.700
The company has these vats that they mix everything in and they don't properly

34
00:01:55.701 --> 00:01:58.240
clean the vats.
And if they don't properly clean the VAT,

35
00:01:58.241 --> 00:02:02.120
so you're buying some stuff from China who knows what they're chucking in there.

36
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.970
They got steroids in there.
They got this,
they got that.

37
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.730
A lot of creatine is tainted,
were all sorts of shit,

38
00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:09.910
a lot of different supplements or tanked.
And that's what you saw it.

39
00:02:09.911 --> 00:02:14.420
I thought it could have been at first.
Tim Means yes,
it happens to um,
uh,

40
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.010
Yoel Romero.
Yes.

41
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.620
<v 1>Lots of goals.
So this stuff is,
is,
is contaminated.
Right.</v>

42
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.740
And so you saw it was,
was testing me.

43
00:02:23.741 --> 00:02:28.741
I had had a fight in September of 2016 against our Lawsky and then after that I

44
00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:34.480
was like,
Yo,
I'm just going to take a break for a while.
I'm not fighting for,

45
00:02:34.481 --> 00:02:38.140
I'm going to tour Europe and goof off and whatever.
And then when I get back,
I,

46
00:02:38.141 --> 00:02:40.570
you know,
I don't really,
I dunno what I'm going to get back in the ring.

47
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.580
And they're like,
all right,
whatever.
And Ufc we told them and,

48
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.150
but you saw it would still come around and test and it's like,
okay,
fine,

49
00:02:49.151 --> 00:02:49.610
whatever.

50
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.170
<v 0>So this is post testing positive.
This is pre.
Pre.
Okay.</v>

51
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.030
And so you fought Arlovski and you said,
I'm just going to chill for a while.

52
00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.340
<v 1>Yeah.
And then one day,
uh,
well like for one,</v>

53
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:02.830
when I'm out there in Europe and I let them know like,
Hey,

54
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:07.831
I'm going fucking where the wind takes me in Europe and I don't have a

55
00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:12.220
whereabouts to fill in because I could be on a train moving here,
moving there,

56
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:15.580
whatever,
which is your prerogative,
right as a human being.
And they,

57
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.300
they know that and yet then they go ahead and sent someone to my fucking house

58
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:22.150
to try and test me while I'm in Europe and I'm just going,
Whoa,
okay.

59
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.220
Isn't there like an app or you feel as an APP?
But if I'm at work,
you have,

60
00:03:27.221 --> 00:03:30.130
you can fill out what you're supposed to be ahead of time for the most part.

61
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.460
So on Tuesday the 16th,

62
00:03:33.461 --> 00:03:37.300
I'm going to be at this place from this time to this time and then,
and then,

63
00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:38.350
but what is your home base?

64
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.740
So if we don't go to these places and we'll just meet you at your home at some

65
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:45.460
time or whatever,
he just decided to go to Japan.
Yeah.
Do you have to tell them,

66
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:45.731
hey,

67
00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:50.260
today I'm going to take a train to Osaka today I'm going to go to the mountains.

68
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.330
So you have to give them a detailed itinerary every day.
Every day.
Okay.

69
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.140
And so I'm like,
Fuck Dude,

70
00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:59.020
I'm just trying to be out here living just doing whatever.
I'm not fighting,

71
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.170
but you know,
when I get home,
you test me wherever you want.

72
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.090
You just want him to enjoy a vacation,
just travel.
Correct.
And uh,

73
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.000
they go,
they send someone in my house.
I was like,
fuck.
All right.

74
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.830
And then there are times where,

75
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.510
so what happens when they send someone to your house,

76
00:04:13.511 --> 00:04:17.290
but you told them you weren't there?
Uh,
well for one,
no one told them.

77
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.970
I don't know how,
what mechanical elements within their organization,

78
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:25.540
how that works.
But they sent someone there anyways.
I'm not there.

79
00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:28.960
That can use a head count.
Does it count because you,

80
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:32.200
did you tell them that you were going to be on the road?
I,
we did.

81
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.550
So they still counted that as you not being there for a test?
Yes.

82
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.620
Well that doesn't make any fucking sense.
Well,
it is what it is.
So,
uh,

83
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.600
but wait a minute,
if they're going to give you a strike,
like don't,
don't,

84
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:49.300
they have to follow their protocol and their protocols.

85
00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:52.840
You have to inform them of where you're going to be.
Right.
Because you did that.

86
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.400
You inform them.
Where are you going to be?

87
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.950
My manager literally told new whiskey and the UFC,

88
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.430
he's not going to be home for almost a month and he's fucking practically

89
00:05:06.161 --> 00:05:09.220
backpacking all through Europe going from place to place to place.

90
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.930
So he's going to be real hard to get ahold of.
Good time to take steroids.

91
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.430
Oh yeah.
Get just,
just,
just fucking get that.
Come back

92
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.680
to the gills.
Yeah.
You'll pass.
If they showed up in Europe,

93
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.550
you did give them your location and you told them where you are if they would,

94
00:05:27.551 --> 00:05:31.090
but I was gone.
I didn't fill in any locations.
I just went wherever I went.

95
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.140
So when you went,
wherever you went and your manager told you,

96
00:05:35.141 --> 00:05:39.430
saw that you were in Europe,
they still showed up your house in La.
Okay,

97
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.480
well that doesn't seem to make any sense.
And,
and they give you a strike.
Yes.

98
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.900
So I'm like,
okay,
that's aggravating.
I don't cowboy is strike when he was at UFC.

99
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.480
Yeah.
Yeah.
So it's stuff like that and I saw that and I'm like,
you know what,

100
00:05:52.481 --> 00:05:56.110
I just,
I,
I can't fuck around with any of this stuff.

101
00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.110
I don't want people to use this as some sort of a kindling to try and start a

102
00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:06.260
fire about me.
And so then I get back home and they're,
you know,
test me again,

103
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.040
like all right,
fine,
whatever.
And then they test me again and I'm like,
okay,

104
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.620
now you made,

105
00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:15.740
just made me late to an audition as you just showed up out of nowhere.
Cool.

106
00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.670
I can do that.
Like they can just show up.
You can't say,
Hey,

107
00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:22.460
I have an appointment to keep their there.

108
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.610
We even if you're not fighting,

109
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.910
like say if you're running out the door and you have a business appointment,

110
00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:32.030
how long does it take for them to test you?
A depends on what they're doing,

111
00:06:32.031 --> 00:06:35.270
whether it's blood and urine or just urine.
Both me,

112
00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:38.390
it's always been blood in urine.
So you can't say,
hey,

113
00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:40.600
you guys are going to have to come with me because uh,

114
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.640
I got to go to this fucking audition,
you know,
I dunno,
I didn't try that.

115
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.070
I would say that get in the car bitch,
boom.

116
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.970
Well how are you going to sit there and have someone draw blood and not going to

117
00:06:49.971 --> 00:06:51.650
you?
You guys are going to have to deal when I'm done.

118
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.920
Like if you want to keep an eye on me,
come with me the whole way.

119
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.350
I always took it as they showed up.
It's like,
well here it goes.

120
00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:58.850
That doesn't seem to make any sense.

121
00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:02.720
If you have previous commitments and you have to do something,

122
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.990
they shouldn't have like ultimate precedent over your life.

123
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.510
Like they shouldn't be able to just decide like showing up randomly.

124
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.310
I San Jose could,
they could make an argument in some way on that.

125
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.270
But if you have a life,
well in any case,
so I take this test and I'm like,

126
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.660
all right,
I'm just going to retire for now.

127
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.770
I got too much shit I got to do.
I'm not fighting anytime soon.

128
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.420
I've got my new Japan and stuff,
I've got auditions,
I've got all these things.

129
00:07:29.421 --> 00:07:33.980
I'm traveling and I just,
I'm not going to fight.
Right.
So just leave me be,

130
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.120
and then I'm in Japan and the fucking,

131
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.620
the very last test I took right before retiring.

132
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:48.290
Oh,
your flag.
And I'm like,
you gotta be fucking kidding me.
Really,

133
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.280
really.
All these tests over all these years,

134
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:56.330
me being the first person to do complete out of competition or are in

135
00:07:56.331 --> 00:08:00.080
competition,
random urine and blood testing.

136
00:08:00.081 --> 00:08:03.350
When I worked with a water and then Nevada state athletic commission when I

137
00:08:03.351 --> 00:08:04.250
fought Travis Browne.

138
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.760
So no one had ever done actual random testing before and there was no,

139
00:08:07.761 --> 00:08:11.510
you saw to involve in the UFC yet going through,
why did you do that?

140
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:16.780
It was something that the NSAC wanted to see done and I'm like,

141
00:08:16.971 --> 00:08:17.721
fine.
You know what?

142
00:08:17.721 --> 00:08:20.160
I wanted to see that done because you had tested positive in the past.

143
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:21.201
And so I was like,

144
00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:24.170
do you tested positive before in the past you've taken some stuff,
right?

145
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.920
I tested positive for antibiotics in the past while,

146
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.050
but I mean the supplement market used to be way wilder than it used to be.

147
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.640
Well and also well end the way.

148
00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:35.270
The just fighting was way wild riding was way while they're,

149
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.850
the supplement industry was way wilder.

150
00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.340
It's like back in Oh two you could still buy all this shit over the counter.

151
00:08:40.341 --> 00:08:42.980
That bio for got reclassified as steroids.

152
00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:47.981
I remember I was taking this shit called Mag 10 I remember 10 what was the name

153
00:08:48.141 --> 00:08:52.480
of the company that makes that a death incorporate ethic cooperated that she I

154
00:08:52.481 --> 00:08:56.910
should is all steroids is steroids.
It was steroids.
100%.

155
00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.000
I remember [inaudible] he came like 10 pounds in six weeks on that shit.

156
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.700
You just get Jack.
But that was all over the counter.
Yeah.

157
00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:04.770
You used to be able to buy a lot of stuff.
And by the way,

158
00:09:04.771 --> 00:09:07.240
liver toxicity is probably off the charts.
Probably.

159
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.540
It was a lot of those things that are like super bad for you.
Yeah.

160
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:14.460
But real effective,
they fucking work.
This stuff worked.
But,
uh,
so,

161
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:18.600
you know,
there was a whole different era.
And then with California,

162
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.260
you know,
I,
I had an issue with,
with a contaminant,

163
00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:25.270
what I believe ultimately to be a contamination,

164
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.290
but I didn't take all the steps that I had this time.

165
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:32.160
And once that whole process was such a motherfuck,
I'm like,

166
00:09:32.161 --> 00:09:36.120
this is never going to happen again.
So every supplement lot that I took,

167
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.800
I would always keep bits of it behind for,
until I need,
I could,

168
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.900
I felt there was enough time it expired and get rid of it because no one's going

169
00:09:42.901 --> 00:09:47.550
to come back and test me.
I passed all my tests.
So,
so once you pass your test,

170
00:09:47.551 --> 00:09:49.860
you would get rid of the old site.
I don't need to keep those lots.

171
00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:52.710
And you're supposed to take the only third party verified.

172
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:57.210
That's not what they say necessarily.
They suggested,
I guess now,

173
00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.110
but I know that,
uh,
with this brand of Tribulus I'd taken,

174
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:06.000
I had taken three or four different other supplements in the same company and

175
00:10:06.001 --> 00:10:10.230
all pass no problem on their test.
Right.
So it was just some weird contamination,

176
00:10:10.231 --> 00:10:12.870
which does happen again.
Happened at Tim means,
yes,

177
00:10:12.871 --> 00:10:15.840
it's happened to several funny as far as I can tell.
I mean,

178
00:10:15.841 --> 00:10:17.520
I'm not testing their whole product line,

179
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:21.750
but it just seemed like a fluke and just such a simple supplement in any case

180
00:10:21.751 --> 00:10:25.320
over one ingredient deal.
So then they come back,
they're like,
oh,

181
00:10:25.321 --> 00:10:28.980
you tested positive for this.
I'm like,
well,
that ain't fucking possible.

182
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.210
So then I send in some supplements,
which I had to pay for to have them tested.

183
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.840
They run him through the testing and then bang,
they find it all right.

184
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.820
There you go.
There's your deal.
Then they went out and bought a brand new bottle,

185
00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.840
unopened.
Same Lot tested that one.
Verify the results.

186
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:49.800
Same thing.
Test,
same thing.
Doesn't happen.
Then Tim means as well.

187
00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:53.940
So then you were in contact with Usada throughout the entirety of this.

188
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:59.040
So we don't ever break contact with Usada.
Uh,
we have a specific guy,

189
00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:00.450
and I'm not going to throw his name out there or anything,

190
00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:05.430
but we have a guy that we spoke to directly the whole time through my manager.

191
00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:05.980
Uh,

192
00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:10.980
speaking with him and I've seen the emails and so we're talking about how we

193
00:11:11.401 --> 00:11:15.210
know this is a contamination.
And when,
you know,
when we get done with all this,

194
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:19.490
why don't we even try to put together something,
some,

195
00:11:19.491 --> 00:11:20.850
some promotional stuff,

196
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.730
anything that we can do to try and keep athletes from ending up in the same

197
00:11:23.731 --> 00:11:26.970
issues.
And we,
we'd like to do whatever we could to help you guys out with this.

198
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.050
You know,
we're not against you.
We're up.

199
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:32.910
We don't mind being a part of the system and we understand why you're here.

200
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:37.620
And I'm not against them wanting to do drug testing or whatever and try to keep

201
00:11:37.621 --> 00:11:42.210
a,
a,
a clean and fair playing field.
I,
I get the point of it.

202
00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:46.140
Uh,
so we get the supplements tested,

203
00:11:46.141 --> 00:11:49.680
they test the secondary batch,
they have all their information.
It's like,

204
00:11:49.681 --> 00:11:54.040
all right,
this would be a fucking rock and roll.
And then they got real quiet.

205
00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:59.260
Okay.
Uh,
now you're not talking to us anymore.

206
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.290
What do you mean?
Like you would contact them,
they wouldn't respond.

207
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:04.540
They would take him a week,
two weeks.

208
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.570
And what were they saying when they do respond?
Uh,
you know,
I,

209
00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:11.320
I can't entirely remember myself if my manager was in touch with them.

210
00:12:11.321 --> 00:12:12.220
And what is the protocol?

211
00:12:12.221 --> 00:12:15.940
If someone tests positive for something that's a tainted Sapa men and it's a

212
00:12:15.941 --> 00:12:19.960
third party supplement and where it's not or it was not third party verified

213
00:12:19.961 --> 00:12:20.531
rather well,

214
00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:23.530
I don't even know if it was third party verified that anything would be any

215
00:12:23.531 --> 00:12:26.110
different.
Hmm,
okay.

216
00:12:26.111 --> 00:12:30.190
Well if it is third party verified and still is tainted,
yeah,

217
00:12:30.191 --> 00:12:33.670
that would be an issue,
right?
Yeah.
If you tested positive,
he tested positive,

218
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:34.540
they found a supplement.

219
00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:39.840
I think the idea about third party verified is it's much less likely to be a

220
00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:42.480
taste.
It does include solve anything.
Right.

221
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.730
And this is coming from someone who's in the supplement business,
you know,

222
00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:49.560
there's a certain amount of this stuff you farm out.
So,
uh,

223
00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:54.580
as far as I know what the deal is,
there is a period of ineligibility sort of,

224
00:12:54.581 --> 00:12:55.414
or basically what,

225
00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.930
what happens is you're effectively suspended until this thing is all finished

226
00:12:58.931 --> 00:13:03.190
out and they tried to say that you're not suspended.
There's no suspension,

227
00:13:03.191 --> 00:13:04.750
but that's not true.

228
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.720
But no one's going to book you for a treat you as you're suspended.

229
00:13:07.721 --> 00:13:11.920
I tried to Corner Travis Brown cause I was training him and they wouldn't let
me,

230
00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:16.300
it wouldn't let you the corner mission with let me try it.
Yes.
Okay.
And so a lot.

231
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.780
And they're like,
you're suspended so you can't,
you can't corner.

232
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:22.580
But you said you're not suspended.
Yeah,
exactly.
Okay.

233
00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:26.620
So you're effectively suspended.
You can't work.

234
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:30.400
You can't even work as a tertiary individual,
as a,

235
00:13:30.401 --> 00:13:32.860
as a corner man or anything like that.
He can't be at the event.

236
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.870
And this is after the fact where you brought them,
the supplements,

237
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:42.040
they independently verified that it was tainted.
And uh,

238
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.570
so then we start talking and,
and throughout the process I said,
look,

239
00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:51.930
I'm not taking a punishment for contamination and I'm not even fighting.

240
00:13:51.971 --> 00:13:55.070
I'm not fighting anytime soon.
I'm not you.

241
00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:58.660
You can't like what you did with means and these other people,
you punish them.

242
00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:02.620
You know that there was contamination,
but you punish them.
Yeah.

243
00:14:02.621 --> 00:14:06.310
They gave them many months.
Yes.
Of A,
you know,
suspension.

244
00:14:06.311 --> 00:14:09.190
So that they weren't able to compete or make a living during those months.

245
00:14:09.191 --> 00:14:11.320
And I'm like,
no,
I'm not dealing.
I'm not taking that.

246
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:15.370
That's not acceptable because I'm not,
that's not what's going on here.

247
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:19.870
Nobody is doping.
Nobody's trying to cheat the system.
There is no,

248
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:23.320
I'm not even fighting you.
You don't get by punishing me.

249
00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.820
You're trying to live guilt on me.

250
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.670
You're trying to make me out to be some sort of,
uh,
uh,

251
00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:30.700
you know,
uh,

252
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:35.410
guilty party as if I'm trying to be achieved of some sort.
And I was like,

253
00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.890
I'm not dealing,
I'm not taking that.
So how did it ultimately get resolved?
Well,

254
00:14:38.891 --> 00:14:43.480
ultimately what ended up happening is we had to go to arbitration.
That was all,

255
00:14:43.481 --> 00:14:48.210
it was really left to us because then they started trying to bring up,
uh,
uh,

256
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:51.980
stuff from my past and then weigh that against me as well.
And it's like,
Whoa,

257
00:14:51.981 --> 00:14:53.360
dude,
you guys weren't even around.

258
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:57.460
And now you get to decide to add to the weight of,

259
00:14:57.461 --> 00:15:02.150
of whatever punishments you want to levy against me based on things that didn't

260
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:05.690
involve you.
Great.
What were they talking about?

261
00:15:05.691 --> 00:15:07.610
They're talking about 2001 no,

262
00:15:07.611 --> 00:15:12.440
2008 they went to 2008 yeah,
they tried and they tried to say,

263
00:15:12.441 --> 00:15:15.490
well,
oh yeah,
well this happened.
So then therefore,
you know,

264
00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.650
now they start talking about two years.
[inaudible] thank you.

265
00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.060
And you gotta be fucking kidding me.

266
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:22.910
They start talking about suspending you for two years for a tainted supplement.

267
00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:27.170
Yes.
Wow.
And I'm just going,
there's no way.
I wouldn't even expect six months.

268
00:15:27.171 --> 00:15:28.430
You think I'm going to take two years.

269
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:31.850
And so we go and we inquire on the Arbor and I've done,

270
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.450
I did an interview with the guy that we were dealing with through Skype.
Uh,

271
00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:37.850
we've,
we've been in touch.
It's just like at some point,

272
00:15:37.851 --> 00:15:42.200
everything turned and changed.
Their tone changed there.

273
00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.860
Even the original penalties,
they were looking to levy increased.

274
00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:50.060
New Shit gets brought in.
It's like they became a completely different animal.

275
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.160
As soon as you know,

276
00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:57.370
there was the evidence of contamination and that I wasn't gonna I wasn't willing

277
00:15:58.941 --> 00:16:03.530
to take punishment for it.
It wasn't.
What do you think their motivation is here?

278
00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:06.260
I don't think that they,
and this is just my opinion,

279
00:16:06.261 --> 00:16:09.800
I think the way you saw to looks at it,
and it's an easy way to go about it,

280
00:16:09.801 --> 00:16:13.040
is that the more people they deem,
the more effective they appear.

281
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:17.330
It's their affect.
Their efficacy is based on Punnett,
on punishments,
doled out,

282
00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:21.950
not necessarily,
not on lack of punishments at all.
So do you think this is,

283
00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:22.340
you know,

284
00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:27.200
also remembered by the people that are working there so they arbitrarily get to

285
00:16:27.201 --> 00:16:29.000
decide how things go about right.

286
00:16:29.001 --> 00:16:32.630
There's not like a very strict protocol that they must follow.

287
00:16:32.631 --> 00:16:34.980
They're tainted supplements are for this?
No,

288
00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:38.290
there is actually quite a bit of a lever or there's,

289
00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.840
there's leeway in terms of how they can enforce them,
what they can enforce.

290
00:16:41.841 --> 00:16:46.460
So when,
so subjective it's up,
there is subjectivity in it.
Um,
they uh,

291
00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:51.320
they have a lot of discretion.
There is some outlined elements of protocol,

292
00:16:51.321 --> 00:16:56.240
but there is no,
it is always this or it is always that.
And,
uh,

293
00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:56.840
you know,

294
00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:00.770
I didn't begrudge them for a period of ineligibility while you're going through

295
00:17:00.771 --> 00:17:04.670
the process of finding out whether this is contamination or what have you doing

296
00:17:04.671 --> 00:17:07.460
any testing.
And that makes sense to me.
That's fine.

297
00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:11.570
I understand that if this guy supposedly has something in a system,

298
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:15.410
well let's figure out what it is and once we have a better idea,

299
00:17:15.411 --> 00:17:18.410
then we can decide about whether you can go back into the pool or do this or do

300
00:17:18.411 --> 00:17:21.830
that or with,
if you're going to ever any punishments make sense to me.

301
00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.140
But in addition to that,

302
00:17:24.141 --> 00:17:26.600
then tacking on more shit in terms of my case and I was like,

303
00:17:26.601 --> 00:17:30.140
that's not acceptable.
So we,
we go,

304
00:17:30.141 --> 00:17:33.140
well I guess the only thing left to us as to go to arbitration.

305
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:36.440
And so my manager spoke with,
um,

306
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:41.240
when I was working through them to arbitration and we said,
okay,
well we'll,

307
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:42.680
what is that going to take?
Well,

308
00:17:42.681 --> 00:17:45.880
that's going to cost more money out of my pocket.
Um,
you know,

309
00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:47.390
the arbitration process,

310
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:52.200
these are guys that they're paid by Usada to do their arbitration.

311
00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:53.940
Like they worked for them in a way or they're not,

312
00:17:53.941 --> 00:17:56.010
they don't work under them directly,
but they are,

313
00:17:56.130 --> 00:18:01.130
they do get paid to be a arbitrary to somehow there's some something get

314
00:18:01.771 --> 00:18:05.610
contracted by Usada.
Yes.
And uh,
and so that was like,
ah,

315
00:18:05.611 --> 00:18:08.180
I don't necessarily feel the most comfortable with that,
but I don't,

316
00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:09.960
I can also understand how it's not,

317
00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.350
there's probably not an easier way to go about it,
but,
okay.
I got it.

318
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.530
Then when we,
uh,

319
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:20.550
then we get notice back from Usada that we have to limit the scope of our

320
00:18:20.551 --> 00:18:24.370
argument.
We're like,
Whoa,
Whoa,
Whoa,
what you,

321
00:18:24.371 --> 00:18:27.300
you're going to tell us what we can and can't argue.
And arbitration,

322
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:33.660
I don't remember what the definitions were exactly,
but it was like,
you can't,

323
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:38.010
you know,
you have to keep it within this boundary and this realm and this.

324
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.950
And I'm like,
well,

325
00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:43.890
you can't fucking try to say the levy this against me and then you stuff from my

326
00:18:43.891 --> 00:18:46.050
past and then tell me I can't argue my full case.

327
00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.570
So they're limiting the amount that you could defend yourself as though you're

328
00:18:48.571 --> 00:18:53.400
saying basically like they were limiting the,
um,
the range of argument.

329
00:18:53.401 --> 00:18:55.860
You could make the argument be that you would bring up,

330
00:18:55.861 --> 00:18:59.790
that they would want to limit?
Uh,
that's a good question.

331
00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.010
I don't know exactly.
Did they define that?

332
00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.870
They know they had definitions in the emails with,

333
00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:09.300
with back and forth with my manager.
And he goes,
well fuck we,
you know,

334
00:19:09.301 --> 00:19:14.160
cause we could argue about,
um,
you know,
this is contamination.
Um,
and,

335
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:18.300
and go from there.
But if it's something really potentially limiting,

336
00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:21.300
which was weird about how they put it,
I just don't remember what exactly,

337
00:19:21.301 --> 00:19:24.180
I don't remember all the details.
It's very detail oriented.
It's legal ease.

338
00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:29.040
And uh,
and then so we get to the point,
it's like,
well fuck,

339
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:32.880
well this doesn't even look like a very,
you know,

340
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.320
this might not even be a,
a useful way of trying to approach this thing.

341
00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.590
And it got down to the wire to where,

342
00:19:40.591 --> 00:19:44.880
and we kept pushing it back and pushing it back and saying like,
you know,

343
00:19:44.881 --> 00:19:46.530
we can we get an extension and,

344
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:50.370
and to try and figure out how the hell did we approach this.
And,

345
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:51.410
and also like how,

346
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.780
how could we approach it without having to spend money on having lawyers get

347
00:19:54.781 --> 00:19:55.261
involved.

348
00:19:55.261 --> 00:19:58.320
I mean that's the last thing you want to do is get to litigation or you know,

349
00:19:58.321 --> 00:20:02.110
even arbitration.
It's a legal process.
It's complex and it is,
it's,

350
00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:03.180
there's a lot of uh,

351
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:08.270
and lawyers love billable hours or they do and so it gets down to the wire

352
00:20:08.941 --> 00:20:13.530
essentially.
And we,
I just sit back and I go,

353
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:16.950
I won't accept any ruling if it's a punishment at all.

354
00:20:16.951 --> 00:20:20.160
I don't care what they say.
I'll just be like,
Nah,
not I,
I don't,

355
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:23.070
I'm not going to abide by it.
You can't force me to do shit.

356
00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:24.510
And I guess we'll have to cross

357
00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:30.030
<v 0>position is that if you are accidentally taking a tainted supplement and also</v>

358
00:20:30.731 --> 00:20:34.630
trace amounts that have absolutely zero effect on performance,

359
00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:39.070
there's nothing that you're doing by accidentally taking that that in any way

360
00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:41.730
would help you and that's a fact.
That's a proven fact.
Yes.

361
00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:44.290
So your position is you shouldn't be punished.
Correct.

362
00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.040
Then you're out of the year when,
once you,

363
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.180
<v 1>the time that you've been out.
Here's the thing,
that's enough.
Exactly.</v>

364
00:20:52.181 --> 00:20:56.560
It's one thing you don't need to say,
oh well if you,
if it took six,

365
00:20:56.561 --> 00:20:59.740
if it took a seven months to get the,
the,

366
00:20:59.741 --> 00:21:03.280
the information that you needed the data,
right to then clarify,
okay,

367
00:21:03.281 --> 00:21:07.210
well you're not at fault to then say,
oh well we'll suspend you for six months.

368
00:21:07.211 --> 00:21:08.800
But since that six months is already past,

369
00:21:08.801 --> 00:21:11.380
it's like we didn't suspend you at all.
No.
Motherfucker,

370
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:14.920
when you look in the end of the hunt at the data,

371
00:21:14.921 --> 00:21:18.820
when you go and look at this case,
it says suspended,
which means you punished me,

372
00:21:18.821 --> 00:21:21.010
which means I was guilty in some way.

373
00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.610
You said I'm guilty because that's how you got to punish me,

374
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:27.620
<v 0>right.
It's not,
it's under investigation or you know,</v>

375
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:32.630
after investing you're exonerated after invest.
No,
it's just,

376
00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:34.930
<v 1>no,
you still love to punishment in there to say,</v>

377
00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.700
look how we caught this guy and we punished him and I'm like,
I'm not,

378
00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:41.750
I'm not gonna,
I'm not down for that.
And so oddly enough,

379
00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:46.310
so I was like on aerials or something like that and I said,
I,
I won't accept,

380
00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:49.640
I don't care what they say.
I don't care what punishment they tried to levy.

381
00:21:49.641 --> 00:21:53.520
I don't abide by it.
I won't agree to it.
And I'm done with them.
I,

382
00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:56.750
and someone from the arbitrary,

383
00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:00.350
the arbitrators office who we were dealing with calls us out of the blue and

384
00:22:00.351 --> 00:22:04.940
goes,
so he,
so you still sure you don't want to do this?
I'm like,
well,

385
00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:05.990
and my manager goes,
well,

386
00:22:05.991 --> 00:22:10.760
they said that we have to limit the scope of argument to this and this and we

387
00:22:10.761 --> 00:22:14.150
can't talk.
And then he goes,
no,
you don't.
You can talk about,
you can,

388
00:22:14.151 --> 00:22:16.940
you can bring any argument you want.
Who is saying this to you?

389
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.290
The arbitrator's office,

390
00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:23.370
<v 0>this,
so who would initially come to you and said the elite,
the scope,</v>

391
00:22:23.371 --> 00:22:26.250
your argument.
Usada okay,
so you saw it.

392
00:22:26.251 --> 00:22:29.940
It was attempting to establish some boundaries for your arguments.

393
00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:35.120
But the people who are the actual arbitrators said that that's not true.

394
00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.360
<v 1>Right?
They,
that's not the case.
You don't have,
it doesn't,</v>

395
00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.760
they can't force you to argue in a certain,

396
00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:44.180
<v 0>oh,
okay.
So is it possible that you sought as lawyers?
We're trying to,</v>

397
00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.030
here's the thing I've found about,
about lawyers,
like yeah,

398
00:22:47.031 --> 00:22:50.240
for sure they're necessary and that's all well and good and you need them.

399
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:52.100
But there's a reality,

400
00:22:52.101 --> 00:22:54.890
and this is something that I had to deal with recently in doing something with a

401
00:22:54.891 --> 00:22:59.891
friend through lawyers where they attached to a bunch of shit to this deal that

402
00:23:00.171 --> 00:23:02.540
wasn't supposed to be in there and he didn't even know it was in there.

403
00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:06.230
And then my lawyer is like,
what the fuck is this?
And so I contact him,

404
00:23:06.231 --> 00:23:08.660
what the fuck is this?
And he's like,
what the fuck is that?

405
00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:10.850
So he contacts his lawyers.
What the fuck is this?

406
00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:14.150
And it turns out this is a common thing.
Lawyers,

407
00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:16.300
they wanted to do with each other.
Yeah.

408
00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:19.460
We put this in to give you leverage.

409
00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:21.890
I don't think you necessarily want that,

410
00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:23.930
but we're looking out for your best interests.

411
00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.900
And so now you have a good negotiation point.

412
00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:29.690
If you just go in with what you want,

413
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:31.970
then they're going to ask for more than that.

414
00:23:31.971 --> 00:23:35.090
And then you're not in a strong position because you can't ask for more after

415
00:23:35.091 --> 00:23:36.660
you've already established your initial position.

416
00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:41.730
Everything convoluted there grows by.
But that's the world we live in.

417
00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:46.010
Grandfather was a Tejas world,
pretty,
pretty fair lawyer was assistant attorney

418
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.540
<v 1>general,
the state of Washington.</v>

419
00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.110
He actually wanted me to get into law of all things,
but I'm like,
Eh,

420
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:54.590
I think are the beat out.
My brain's yet seems like,
well,

421
00:23:54.591 --> 00:23:59.240
you haven't beaten them out.
Very impressive with your memory.
So we,
uh,
we get to,

422
00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.910
uh,
my manager comes back to me.
He goes,
hey man,

423
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.970
they just contacted me out of nowhere.
And they're like,
well,

424
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.600
if you want to do this,
you can,
and no,
you can't,
you,
you can make the argument,

425
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:12.770
there's no limiting in the scope of your argument or anything.
So then it's like,

426
00:24:12.771 --> 00:24:17.600
well yeah,
all right,
I'll go for it.
Cause we went to our least.
Yeah.

427
00:24:17.601 --> 00:24:20.820
Cause at the very least I thought maybe I could have some sort of record down
of,

428
00:24:20.821 --> 00:24:23.960
of what,
what we talked about,
what was discussed,
the arguments made.

429
00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:27.680
So in the end,
you know,
no matter how it came out,
I can go here,

430
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:30.830
here's what's legit and then you can,
you can make your own decision from there.

431
00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:35.830
And so we go in,
uh,
I brought my legal team.
They,
he,
they had a,

432
00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.020
their lawyer come who was the same guy we were dealing with throughout the

433
00:24:39.021 --> 00:24:41.450
entire process.
And they made,
you know,

434
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:44.420
their argument and we made ours and you know,
and there,

435
00:24:44.421 --> 00:24:47.840
there are times where I'm sitting back and I go,
you know,
making,

436
00:24:47.841 --> 00:24:50.780
they're making closing arguments,
each lawyers,

437
00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:54.140
and I'm just sitting there listening to the Usada Seigel oh man.

438
00:24:54.141 --> 00:24:58.730
He's just pushing them and he's just moving the goalposts.
He's,
uh,
how so?

439
00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:03.590
Well,
it's just taking a certain element and then trying to use slippery slope

440
00:25:03.591 --> 00:25:05.390
arguments and moving the goalposts on things.

441
00:25:05.391 --> 00:25:10.070
But he's just doing anything he can to use rhetoric instead of logos at this

442
00:25:10.071 --> 00:25:11.120
point because,
you know,

443
00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:13.910
they're lawyers and they're trying to make their case and trying to find

444
00:25:13.911 --> 00:25:17.030
impassioned responses when you're saying this,
you know,

445
00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.120
consider the people listening at home don't really know your case,

446
00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:24.410
don't know the scope.
So it's like trying to say that,
uh,
you know,

447
00:25:24.411 --> 00:25:28.220
find ways at which to move the goalposts in terms of,

448
00:25:28.221 --> 00:25:30.710
so what,
like I said to you earlier,

449
00:25:30.711 --> 00:25:35.090
I keep batches of all the supplements that I take,
especially when I'm in these,

450
00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:36.260
this program.

451
00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:40.430
And especially after dealing with the cluster fuck that was California.

452
00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:40.971
And it's like,
well,

453
00:25:40.971 --> 00:25:45.380
I didn't have anything that I could bring to you that I could fuck,
you know,

454
00:25:45.381 --> 00:25:48.980
so I'm like,
this is never happening again.
So I keep everything.

455
00:25:48.981 --> 00:25:53.330
They go and they test stuff and they find it and I kept notes.

456
00:25:53.331 --> 00:25:56.280
I kept this.
And it's like,
how,

457
00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:00.470
what more could I have done for you guys?
Even if it doesn't matter if there's,

458
00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:02.540
let's say where they were all third party tested as well.

459
00:26:02.541 --> 00:26:06.290
I would still keep batches of the supplements in any of this stuff.

460
00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:08.880
I take third party testing.
What was the issue then?
Well,

461
00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:10.110
it's just simply it's this,

462
00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.910
they kept trying to say that I didn't do a good enough job that uh,

463
00:26:13.911 --> 00:26:15.460
did you use the,
uh,

464
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:19.370
did you see this thing on supplement form one one?

465
00:26:19.371 --> 00:26:23.960
It's like that came out after the fact and yes I have seen that.
In fact,

466
00:26:23.961 --> 00:26:28.190
I use all the resources that you provided your global dro,
your other supplement,

467
00:26:28.191 --> 00:26:33.020
four one,
one two check against ingredient lists,
supplement names,

468
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:37.070
company names to make sure none of this shit is on the list so that I don't make

469
00:26:37.071 --> 00:26:41.330
that mistake.
So I use the resources that you give me.
I keep batches of my,

470
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:46.260
my supplement so they can be tested if be I do what's available to keep from any

471
00:26:46.261 --> 00:26:47.094
issues.

472
00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:51.450
And yet they just kept moving the goalpost on that and trying to say that.
Well,

473
00:26:51.451 --> 00:26:54.450
but you didn't,
uh,
you didn't hire a psychic.
You know,

474
00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:58.680
it's just that kind of shit.
I'm like,
well,
how,
how can this have been any better?

475
00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:00.450
And not to mention I'm not fighting.

476
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:05.570
<v 0>Right.
So at the end of the day,
what were they looking for in arbitration?</v>

477
00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:06.510
<v 1>Uh,</v>

478
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:11.510
they wanted to levy a punishment against me and suspend me for years.

479
00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:13.440
And this is,
you saw.
Yes.

480
00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:14.780
<v 0>So you saw it ultimately,</v>

481
00:27:14.781 --> 00:27:19.010
even though they knew that you took a tainted supplement that had no effect

482
00:27:19.011 --> 00:27:20.390
whatsoever on your performance,
right?

483
00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:24.230
They still wanted to punish you for two years.
That seems stupid.

484
00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:26.840
That just seems stupid.
Now,
let me,

485
00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:30.470
let me read Jeff Novitsky because Novitsky texted me because I told them this

486
00:27:30.471 --> 00:27:34.280
was going to go down and his take is a little bit different than yours.

487
00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:37.460
<v 1>I don't imagine.
It isn't.
All right.
I'm,
I'm not surprised that it is.</v>

488
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:41.170
<v 0>And I,
uh,
I told you what it was,
um,
the,
so this is,</v>

489
00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:43.240
I'll just read you what it says.
Uh,

490
00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:48.000
he said he'll complain about the amount of time that went by with Usada process,

491
00:27:48.001 --> 00:27:52.170
but he notified us of retirement right after the positive sample was collected

492
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:54.330
before,
uh,
positive was announced.

493
00:27:54.331 --> 00:27:59.331
So he was off in the wind for many months and not communicating with you sought

494
00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:01.170
out a big reason.

495
00:28:01.171 --> 00:28:05.430
The case took so long to resolve to his positive was from a tainted supplement,

496
00:28:05.431 --> 00:28:07.110
but he didn't do the number one thing.

497
00:28:07.111 --> 00:28:11.130
We advise the UFC athletes on UFC athletes on supplements.

498
00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:15.340
He didn't choose a supplement that was third party certified,
uh,

499
00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:19.110
as a banned substance free like on its supplements are,

500
00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:24.570
there are literally hundreds of certified supplements out there in virtually and

501
00:28:24.571 --> 00:28:29.010
virtually ensures no issues,
uh,
for an athlete if they stick with those.

502
00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.680
Uh,
one other point for Barnett,

503
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:36.120
when he was unresponsive to case he missed all of his deadlines to file for

504
00:28:36.121 --> 00:28:37.740
arbitration.
Uh,

505
00:28:37.741 --> 00:28:41.130
he came to the table later and said he wanted to go to arbitration.

506
00:28:41.131 --> 00:28:43.530
You saw to made an exclusion and let him,

507
00:28:43.531 --> 00:28:47.250
which ultimately led to his favorable ruling by arbitrator.

508
00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:52.110
Their reasoning was that they wanted to rule in favor of fairness to athlete

509
00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:57.000
rules.
Say they didn't have to after time,
uh,
to file expired.
Well,

510
00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:00.090
but they're saying you it ruled favorably towards you

511
00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:04.800
<v 1>Melanie at the end of the day.
Yes.
They like gobbly Goop,
this,
that,
the other.</v>

512
00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:10.020
It's just like he says that uh,
oh well he retired and he was in the wind.

513
00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:12.120
You know what my in the wind was?
It wasn't even that long.

514
00:29:12.121 --> 00:29:15.000
I was in Japan for rising with my athlete.

515
00:29:15.001 --> 00:29:18.060
Alyssa Garcia wasn't in the fucking wind.
Sounds good though.

516
00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.250
The wind and the wind.

517
00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:24.150
<v 2>What fucking dude you and that motorcycle jacket just drives him.
Yeah,</v>

518
00:29:24.151 --> 00:29:29.010
I'm a car from behind me,
like Django through the Nevada

519
00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:31.810
<v 0>desert.
Somebody pulls you over and got eight days growth on your face.</v>

520
00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:35.930
You charge Barnett some days.
Where you Sada we're,
we're looking for bro Broken.

521
00:29:35.931 --> 00:29:37.420
I,
he pissed this cup for me.

522
00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:41.810
<v 1>Breakup.
Just,
yeah,
I was in Japan at,
you know,</v>

523
00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:46.090
I wasn't in the wind and uh,
they,
so it takes in your favor.

524
00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:49.240
They arbitrary arbitrator and what did they say?

525
00:29:49.241 --> 00:29:52.240
This is the same guy that the arbitrator is,

526
00:29:52.241 --> 00:29:55.660
the same guy that put together is he's an ICARUS.
He produced ICARUS,

527
00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:59.260
the movie on,
on doping.
He is,

528
00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:03.430
he's one of the major figures in terms of the world of anti-doping.

529
00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:08.440
So it's one of the guys who worked with Bryan Fogel.
Uh,
the arbitrator,

530
00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:11.980
it's Bryan Fogel was the guys who started in Icarus.

531
00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:15.860
This guy is a arbitrator for water.
Okay.

532
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:20.280
Actually why am I doing this?
Either way,
Jamie,
Jamie can handle this,

533
00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:24.940
but it doesn't matter.
Uh,
and so this guy has day everything in terms of,

534
00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:28.330
of drug testing the rule in your favor.
Yes.
And he said he does it.

535
00:30:28.331 --> 00:30:32.280
He couldn't see any way that I could have done hardly a better job than I would

536
00:30:32.281 --> 00:30:35.290
meticulous with my record keeping that uh,
I may,

537
00:30:35.291 --> 00:30:40.291
I did essentially anything I could in the means of a normal person to do.

538
00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:45.070
How was it resolved at the end?
Uh,
it was a,
the last of reprimand.

539
00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:49.830
That's it.
Reprimand?
Yeah.
What does that,
what do they do?
Richard Eight.

540
00:30:49.831 --> 00:30:53.710
Chef Richard Mclaren Claren.
Oh,
see,
chief arbitrator.
Yes.

541
00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:59.080
Okay.
So at the end of the day,
after all this,

542
00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:01.240
they say they give you a reprimand.
What does that mean?

543
00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:05.080
That just means like don't do that.
Be careful.
Yeah.
Okay.

544
00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:09.040
But this took no punishment.
Right?

545
00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:14.110
And so all that two year shit from Usada was unwarranted.
Right?
And heavy handed,

546
00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:17.550
heavy handed as hell.
And,
and junior dos Santos went through that too.
Right?

547
00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:22.000
Started at at six months.
And then by the time we,

548
00:31:22.001 --> 00:31:25.000
they have both supplements tested,

549
00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:28.900
then all of a sudden it starts getting weird.
And you know,

550
00:31:28.901 --> 00:31:33.670
this claim by new whiskey that we were out of,
no,
we were always in touch.

551
00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:35.740
Novitsky doesn't work for you saw it.
And I know,

552
00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:40.960
and this is so what's Kinda funny is new whiskey is such a public face on this

553
00:31:41.021 --> 00:31:45.940
kind of thing.
But when it comes to actually dealing with Usada,
he's all,

554
00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:48.130
he's hands up.
I mean,
he'll come and he'll,

555
00:31:48.131 --> 00:31:52.600
he'll make sure to put something out there in any of the sphere.
But in reality,

556
00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.390
he ain't got a fucking thing to do with any of them.
Okay.
But in his defense,

557
00:31:55.391 --> 00:31:59.680
he's a UFC employee and it's inappropriate for him to have any influence

558
00:31:59.681 --> 00:32:02.930
whatsoever on the way they rule things that,
but that's,
that is that is that,

559
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.100
I think that's actually the proper thing for him to do it in a way.

560
00:32:06.101 --> 00:32:08.890
But I mean it's just,
it's a,
it's a,
it's it,

561
00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:11.680
the presentation is a bit of a misnomer.
I think so.

562
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:16.450
Well initially he was responsible for the drug testing.
Now he's,
what is he,

563
00:32:16.451 --> 00:32:20.200
the president of athletes?
Safety and wellness.
Fuck a flower thing.

564
00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:23.050
They're running the performance institute.
Yeah.
I mean what they're,

565
00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:27.490
what they're concentrating on now I'm just saying it for Jeff and his draft that

566
00:32:27.491 --> 00:32:32.450
I think they're concentrating more on encouraging fighters to train and,

567
00:32:32.451 --> 00:32:32.721
and,

568
00:32:32.721 --> 00:32:37.150
and fortify their body with nutrition correctly and giving them education on how

569
00:32:37.151 --> 00:32:39.830
to do this and that Jeff is at the forefront of that stuff and showing them

570
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:44.900
<v 0>how to avoid accidentally taking something and definitely had a little boy where</v>

571
00:32:44.901 --> 00:32:49.100
I'm coming with this is that he is not fully in the loop with what happened

572
00:32:49.101 --> 00:32:52.200
between me and Usada cause he's not involved.
Right.

573
00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:56.630
So some of some of what he's saying there is incorrect and it's not,

574
00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:01.250
I don't blame him because he's not a part of it.
So is he misinformed?

575
00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:05.370
I at the very least,
I think that they,
they're not being straight with it.

576
00:33:05.371 --> 00:33:07.670
It sounds to me like they wanted to punish you badly.

577
00:33:07.671 --> 00:33:11.240
They wanted to punish me badly.
Yeah.
Two years is a fucking crazy punishment.

578
00:33:11.241 --> 00:33:13.010
And also when,

579
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:18.070
when people get to remember when I'm Nick Diaz was uh,

580
00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:24.200
was being interviewed by all these people and then there was that mean lady who

581
00:33:24.201 --> 00:33:27.740
works in Nevada [inaudible] commission and she was grilling him and I'm like,

582
00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.830
well you were talking about pot here.
You crazy lady.

583
00:33:30.831 --> 00:33:34.070
Like what in the fuck are you doing?
You're acting like you've robbed a bank.

584
00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:37.460
Even not if he's not getting the ring.
Hi.
And then leave him alone.
Exactly.

585
00:33:37.461 --> 00:33:39.520
And I think he probably did a few times,
I think.

586
00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:44.140
I think in the go army fighting,
he might've been high.
It was like,
oh,

587
00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:46.880
I'm bleeding.
Oh my God,
maybe I should choke him right now.

588
00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:51.560
He didn't give a shit fight.
Jon Jones is going through this right now.

589
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:53.000
I don't know where John Jones stands,

590
00:33:53.001 --> 00:33:58.001
but it's been pretty well established that at the very least what the numbers,

591
00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:02.630
if you look at the numbers when he was tested.
Um,
and you know,
I don't,

592
00:34:02.631 --> 00:34:05.150
I know a lot of people like to say that he's a cheater.
There's,

593
00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:08.690
there's a lot of this going on right now.
Look real clear.

594
00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:13.250
The first test was proven that he took tainted Dick Pills.

595
00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:14.460
Okay,
that's fine.

596
00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:16.350
<v 1>Well it was actually,</v>

597
00:34:16.351 --> 00:34:19.920
so that got brought up to my attention as part of all this because you know,

598
00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:24.420
you saw fell in that relevant,
the difference between that first one,

599
00:34:24.450 --> 00:34:27.190
let's say,
and I'm not,
I don't know about the second shift with John.

600
00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:28.410
I don't really follow close on this,

601
00:34:28.411 --> 00:34:31.320
but this came across my plate because he had,

602
00:34:31.321 --> 00:34:36.321
he was taking like a liquid Cialis and it was from a company that sells sarms

603
00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:40.640
and peptides and all that.

604
00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:44.470
So it was a company that also sells banned substances.
Right.

605
00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:46.950
And so their argument was that dude,

606
00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:50.280
you're buying or using shit from a place full of illegal shit.

607
00:34:50.281 --> 00:34:51.330
You're not supposed to take.

608
00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:52.390
<v 0>Definitely a dumb move.</v>

609
00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:57.550
Does it mean God damn prescription for Cialis?

610
00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:01.540
Right?
You don't need to take this funky shit.
I imagine.
Um,

611
00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:03.610
the second one,

612
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:08.910
what he took had such a minuscule trace amount that he tested negative.

613
00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:12.220
Denny tested positive,
then he tested negative again.

614
00:35:12.221 --> 00:35:14.500
And this is something that's supposed to stay in your system for months.

615
00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:18.700
So this is indicative of someone is not taking something to get into performance

616
00:35:18.701 --> 00:35:22.570
enhancing benefit from it,
but rather someone who had something that was tainted.

617
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:23.950
And these lab technicians

618
00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:27.160
<v 1>are smart on this shit.
Like the guy who saw,
um,</v>

619
00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:31.880
the results from the,
the,
the first little batch of supplements we gave him,
he,

620
00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:36.310
he had seen everything and then some under the sun and all different levels and

621
00:35:36.311 --> 00:35:40.140
this guy knew what,
what constituted contamination,
right?

622
00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.950
Wasn't he could tell,
right?
Of course they can tell just by the numbers.
Look,

623
00:35:43.951 --> 00:35:46.110
if you'd taking trace amounts of anything,

624
00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:49.800
it's not going to do a damn thing to your body in terms of performance
enhancing.

625
00:35:49.801 --> 00:35:52.560
But it is going to show up in these tests because these tests are incredibly

626
00:35:52.561 --> 00:35:54.750
thorough.
Hey Jamie,
Google,

627
00:35:54.751 --> 00:35:58.350
what's going on with Jon Jones case because particularly after this weekend,

628
00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:00.840
it's very,
very relevant.
You know,

629
00:36:00.841 --> 00:36:03.910
I mean with Brock Lesnar getting in there with DC,

630
00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:08.370
just you becoming the first light heavyweight to consecutively hold the light

631
00:36:08.371 --> 00:36:11.490
heavyweight championship and the heavyweight championship,
you know,

632
00:36:11.491 --> 00:36:16.260
and the spectacular fight by DC.
But Jon Jones is always going to be sure.

633
00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:18.000
I mean there you cannot,

634
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:23.160
you can go on and on about the extra curricular woes of John Jones.

635
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:27.360
Sure.
His capabilities as an athlete,
his talent is,

636
00:36:27.361 --> 00:36:31.950
is it's undeniable,
undeniable
look,

637
00:36:31.951 --> 00:36:34.860
whatever the fuck he took Dick Pills,
it's not making them a better fighter.

638
00:36:34.861 --> 00:36:37.920
He didn't knock DCL out because of Dick Pills.
That's crazy.
No,

639
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:42.870
it has to deal with great skill and beautiful left high kick.
That's what it was.

640
00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:48.160
And he recognize a tendency,
DC knows he has,
you know.
Uh,

641
00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.400
but with this whole Usada process,

642
00:36:50.401 --> 00:36:54.980
it just became an it drug on because,
you know,

643
00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:59.250
we said to them,
I'm not going to take a punishment.
And they said,
we won't,

644
00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.770
we're not giving you any option on this.
And so that's,

645
00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:05.870
it's like there was this negotiation.
What,
what happens,
what I want,

646
00:37:05.871 --> 00:37:08.580
one of the things that I've talked about when it comes to police officers is

647
00:37:08.581 --> 00:37:10.470
that when you have police officers and you know,

648
00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.180
people they're trying to arrest it becomes a game.

649
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.370
And I don't mean a game in terms of his bullshit.

650
00:37:14.371 --> 00:37:18.060
I mean it's a game in terms of one person's trying to win and they're trying to

651
00:37:18.061 --> 00:37:19.220
get people and arrest them.

652
00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:23.280
And this is why people plant guns and plant drugs trying to,
when trying to win.

653
00:37:23.281 --> 00:37:26.730
And that's what killed me was that,
to me,
in my opinion,

654
00:37:26.731 --> 00:37:28.500
you soda was trying to win.

655
00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:33.030
It was more important for them to win than it was for us to have a clean sport.

656
00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:36.330
This comes back to what were talking about earlier when it comes to arguments

657
00:37:36.331 --> 00:37:39.930
and discussions that people oftentimes are not really searching for the truth.

658
00:37:39.931 --> 00:37:41.880
They just want to be,
right.
Yes.

659
00:37:41.881 --> 00:37:44.490
And I've had this argument about bureaucracies in general,
right?

660
00:37:44.491 --> 00:37:46.770
And this goes to,
this isn't just about,
you know,

661
00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:49.510
not you saw it and their bureaucratic elements.
I mean,
they're tight,

662
00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.920
like the government.
There are other things.
So you come and you say,
Oh,

663
00:37:52.921 --> 00:37:57.660
you fucked up.
And then the bureaucracy's go,
oh shit,
we didn't fuck up.

664
00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.140
And they're going to say we didn't fuck up to the very,

665
00:38:01.141 --> 00:38:04.630
they'll take that to the very longest lever until either a they'll scape goat

666
00:38:04.631 --> 00:38:09.450
someone or be,
they can figure out a way that they didn't.
Because looking,

667
00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:14.760
making a mistake on a bureaucratic level makes it seem like,
okay,

668
00:38:14.761 --> 00:38:18.840
well fuck if we f and here's the thing,
if you saw this as,
oh,
you know,

669
00:38:18.841 --> 00:38:23.190
you're not you,
you didn't,
you're not going to get punished then to means,

670
00:38:23.191 --> 00:38:27.780
and you'll run Merrill go,
uh,
what did I get punished?
Or if they,

671
00:38:27.781 --> 00:38:30.210
if you sat down and say,
Oh,
well,
you know,

672
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:35.010
that was a miss that that was a mistake.
Well if that was a mistake,
we'll then,

673
00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:37.840
hey,
I got fucked on that mistake.
You got to take care of me.

674
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:42.910
So no drug testing is bad,
but too much oversight is also bad.

675
00:38:42.911 --> 00:38:45.910
I think that a clean sport is,
is AOK,

676
00:38:45.911 --> 00:38:48.580
and the idea of the random testing and all is fine,

677
00:38:48.581 --> 00:38:53.581
but you can't do it at the expense of the athletes in that were in the

678
00:38:54.101 --> 00:38:58.240
administration of the testing that you're trying to blast them.

679
00:38:58.241 --> 00:39:03.010
Like these three Brazilian guys that just got busted over contamination that

680
00:39:03.011 --> 00:39:06.400
they traced back to a compounding pharmacy.
I don't know,
different things.

681
00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:07.660
This is just recent.

682
00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:12.220
So you got three different guys in the UFC and they were all getting supplements

683
00:39:12.221 --> 00:39:16.030
from a compounding pharmacy and everything was traced back to it.

684
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:18.610
It almost seems like you shouldn't take any fucking supplements.
Well,

685
00:39:18.611 --> 00:39:19.271
that's the other thing.

686
00:39:19.271 --> 00:39:22.000
It's like you'll do we are we not allowed to take anything,
anything at all?

687
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:26.320
Nothing.
No on it.
What supplements,
what do they do?
They help your performance.

688
00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:29.440
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
Should you take no performance and answers?
She should.

689
00:39:29.441 --> 00:39:32.500
We take nothing.
She just eat food.
I mean,
it's gotta be someone out there.

690
00:39:32.501 --> 00:39:35.530
It's just,
well,
there's food that will enhance your performance too.
Right?

691
00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:39.730
Like kangaroo meat,
the Frank Mir took it takes some bad kangaroo meat.
Oh Man.

692
00:39:39.731 --> 00:39:43.270
That kangaroo meat,
he'd get a good pump on that.
First of all,

693
00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:47.950
ain't nobody giving steroids to kangaroo.
Okay.
Kangaroos are fucking everywhere.

694
00:39:47.951 --> 00:39:51.280
Investigation identify as compounding pharmacies as a source of tainted

695
00:39:51.281 --> 00:39:56.100
supplements behind three positive Santos Alomeda and Antonio and yeah,

696
00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.480
uh,
Minotauro and here's the weird thing.

697
00:39:58.481 --> 00:40:03.130
So it comes all the way down to it and then they're there highlight on this is,

698
00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:06.760
and you know,
they've,
oh,
we put give them a suspension that,

699
00:40:06.761 --> 00:40:10.030
but at the time has already lapsed so they won't actually have to serve any
time.

700
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:13.960
It's like,
but you just fucking suspended them nonetheless.

701
00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:15.460
You didn't have to do that.

702
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:19.150
So they took seven or eight months or whatever for this get cleared up.

703
00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:23.470
And that's unfortunate.
Jr the tested positive for a diuretic,
is that correct?

704
00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:24.340
That's what it was.

705
00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:27.790
Which core something I'd leave just diarrhetic which is crazy because he's a

706
00:40:27.791 --> 00:40:29.680
fucking heavy one,
not losing any weight.

707
00:40:29.681 --> 00:40:33.180
And g junior's not on the high side of heavyweight.
He's not like a to 65 God.

708
00:40:33.181 --> 00:40:35.410
It's kind of wait to make the upper limit.

709
00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:37.200
Like he's just trying to keep those wrinkles on his face.

710
00:40:37.201 --> 00:40:40.410
Just trying to look good.
Maybe just last ride.
Does diuretics make you look good?

711
00:40:40.411 --> 00:40:43.060
Look,
I don't know.
I don't know.
That may seem show herself.

712
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:47.200
Just tried to write essentially I just pulls all the,

713
00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.830
pulls all the water on bones.
Jones keeping mind.
Life is a journey.
Not a race.

714
00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:55.120
God's will for me to be there.
Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
I forget,

715
00:40:55.121 --> 00:40:57.240
I'm still the youngest guy in the top five of heavyweight and light everywhere.

716
00:40:57.250 --> 00:41:02.110
Yeah,
he is young.
What does that,
what does unique Miseq,

717
00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:05.890
what does that,
oh,
what was he responding to?

718
00:41:05.891 --> 00:41:10.300
Somebody tweeted that a couple hours ago up to a four year span.

719
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:14.340
Right now he remains a provisional suspension of wind in the outcome of the

720
00:41:14.341 --> 00:41:18.010
situation with Usada after testing positive for steroids.

721
00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:22.660
Last July following the knockout went over,
call me.
Um,
was it as Deb Roy?

722
00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.780
Uh,
man,
I couldn't tell you.

723
00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:30.100
John faces up to four year suspension due to second violation.

724
00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:33.970
UFC is anti-doping poverty policy,
but obviously young side,
every champion,
but

725
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:37.040
<v 0>obviously first of all,
when it says second violation,</v>

726
00:41:37.041 --> 00:41:41.120
the first violation was proven to be something tainted.
So it's,
he's not,

727
00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:46.040
when you say violation,
I want,
I want to hear this guy took steroids.

728
00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:50.480
He took steroids because he was trying to get a performance enhancing result

729
00:41:50.481 --> 00:41:55.220
from it.
Suspend that guy.
I don't want to hear,
oh,
he got toothpaste.

730
00:41:55.221 --> 00:41:58.610
It's from China and had fucking something in it that you remember that too,

731
00:41:58.611 --> 00:41:59.060
don't you?

732
00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:02.690
Wasn't that a fucking crazy story about the toothpaste that had some poison in

733
00:42:02.691 --> 00:42:05.180
it or something that they were selling in China?
Yeah.
What was that?

734
00:42:05.181 --> 00:42:07.070
Some wild shit.
What was that.
