Talk about talking to you today is that you represent reason and well thought

2
00:00:04.891 --> 00:00:09.660
out opinions and those two things are very rare.
Well thought out.

3
00:00:09.661 --> 00:00:14.661
Opinions are way more rare in my opinion than what you usually get,

4
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.340
which you usually get as a conglomeration of opinions that seem to make sense

5
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.060
per peripherally or casually.
They have,
uh,

6
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.550
a veneer of logic to them and be like,

7
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.550
I'll go with that because I don't have the time because most people don't have

8
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:30.250
the time.

9
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.610
<v 1>Well,
going back to Israel,
I know we're probably,
are we wrapping up?
No.</v>

10
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.720
Going back to Israel for one second,
it's become like a pillar,
right?
It's like,

11
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.530
okay,
if you're on the left,
I believe in,
you know,

12
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.180
criminal justice reform,
like any number of things.
Oh,
and by the way,

13
00:00:46.181 --> 00:00:46.871
Israel is bad.

14
00:00:46.871 --> 00:00:50.020
Like it became one of those things that most people don't really think about.

15
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.580
Right?
Right.
And like,

16
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.170
I think it's really important to think about things issue by issue and not just

17
00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.071
be like,
Yep,

18
00:00:57.071 --> 00:01:02.071
signing up for this whole slew of policies and views on things when actually

19
00:01:02.081 --> 00:01:04.090
some of those things don't go together at all.

20
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.680
<v 0>Well one thing than the woke left you're not allowed to do is criticize the more</v>

21
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.330
repressive aspects of Islam.
You're not allowed to,
you don't do it.

22
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.360
If you bring up anything becomes Islamophobic in even if it's homophobic

23
00:01:18.941 --> 00:01:19.330
thought,

24
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.330
if the ideas are homophobic or if women have to wear restrictive clothing,

25
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.280
all any,
any of the things that are incredibly commonplace,

26
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.110
you are not allowed to criticize those because those fallen to a protected

27
00:01:35.111 --> 00:01:39.670
category.
I remember when I first ran into this in college when,

28
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.540
<v 1>um,
we were talking,</v>

29
00:01:41.541 --> 00:01:44.960
I was in a conversation with other feminists and I definitely consider myself a

30
00:01:44.961 --> 00:01:47.120
feminist about female genital mutilation.

31
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.050
And I encountered for the first time a species that I've come to know well,

32
00:01:51.051 --> 00:01:55.130
which is feminists who sorted defend female genital mutilation on the grounds of

33
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.650
cultural relativism.
Who are we to judge?

34
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.960
And I remember just like I did not get over the shock of that.

35
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.100
<v 0>You shouldn't do.
I'm not,
that is fucking terrifying.
I mean,
that is,
look,</v>

36
00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:10.380
I'm a,
uh,
outspoken,

37
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.220
rabid critic of circumcision.
I think it's disgusting.

38
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.530
I think it's ridiculous.
It doesn't make any sense,

39
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.030
but at least your Dick still works.

40
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.720
The idea that someone tried to equate circumcision and female genital
mutilation,

41
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.670
a person on the left did when I talked about it recently.
Yeah,

42
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.450
some fucking asshole online.
I don't remember who it was,
but you know,

43
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.190
I didn't even,
I didn't even exchange.
I just,
I just,

44
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.390
I read it and I went there.
Their Vagina doesn't work the same way anymore.

45
00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:42.110
Do you understand that you can't have an orgasm anymore?
Okay.

46
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.380
You're cutting off a woman's clutter is to not because of cleanliness or any

47
00:02:46.381 --> 00:02:51.381
fucking weird logic that they're using today to try to justify circumcision.

48
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.660
Way Worse,
you'll,
you're,

49
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.700
you're doing it to try to eliminate pleasure because you don't want the woman to

50
00:02:56.701 --> 00:02:59.710
leave.
It's the same reason why you want to cover up with some

51
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.210
<v 1>crazy,
but why,
Barb,
how are we hearing the whim,</v>

52
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.750
the leaders of the women's march talk about sad or no honor killings,

53
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.880
female genital mutilation,
forced marriage for,

54
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:16.340
for for girls,
children,
children.
No.

55
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.050
Instead they're talking about bds in Israel.
I don't get it.

56
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.600
I'd love to ask someone about that.
