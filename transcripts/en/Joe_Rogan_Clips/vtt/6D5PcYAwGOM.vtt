1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.830
That's all right.
Did you see Roy McDonald ask him?

2
00:00:03.831 --> 00:00:08.750
Ben Asks you to sign with del Toro and Ben asked her wants to do it too.
Um,

3
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.380
I then asked her and still owes fights with one fc though.

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.030
So they would have to do some sort of a [inaudible] contract with them.
Yeah,

5
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.230
he owes two fights.
He owes two fights.
One FC,

6
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:23.840
I know you're listing do us all a solid,
do all the hardcores Assad them out,

7
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.000
man.
So you're never going to set them out.
What they would do is they would cope.

8
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.260
I'm out and it's possible you now,
if you want to fight in the UFC,
it's possible.

9
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.080
Oh hell.
Co-Promote with one fc you would have to,

10
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.280
it would have to be favorable conditions with the UFC where like they just,

11
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.970
you know,

12
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.510
you can make some sort of a deal with one of seeking stream it or some shit.

13
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.640
Then they would have to be something or they give them a piece of the revenue,

14
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.500
but it would have to be a very small,

15
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.200
the odds are already against and the sign with the assignment,
you go all right.

16
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.840
Now you got to make this deal with one FC and Dana [inaudible] kick rocks.

17
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.140
Well he should do is he should get out of that contract.

18
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.350
That's what he should just smoke two news real fast.
Just smash two dudes.

19
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.380
Just gimme two cans,
but he's the can crusher over there.

20
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.450
Rich Franklin's the guy who does the hell did he Kinko's?

21
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.340
Matt Hume is to Matt Hume's a partner when I was fellow.
What's up?

22
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.010
Let's get this one of the greatest fights all the time.
Roll in my man.

23
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.830
Well who would you have in fight Woodley?

24
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.710
I he's friends with with their trading partners.

25
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.130
I'd have them fight GSP first and they'll hand fight.
Could Be,

26
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.320
do you think GSP would take that fight?

27
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.830
But nobody knows who asked her name is outside of the hardcore fans.

28
00:01:31.831 --> 00:01:34.890
He said he would could be convene three months ago.
70 yeah.
I don't know.

29
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.480
[inaudible] started 70 oh shit.
That is the fight I want to see.

30
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.190
It could be and no ass grin.
Oh,
me too.

31
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.600
Khabib is what I would want to set my number one five d because good luck taking

32
00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:50.460
GSP down.
Just good luck and good luck standing with them too.
You know the,

33
00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:54.720
the standup,
there's a big gap between Ben Asker and stand up at GSP,

34
00:01:54.721 --> 00:01:58.650
so this isn't a big gap between Ben astrons grappling.
Just scrapping.
Sure.
Cap.

35
00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.880
It's true.
It's amazing.

36
00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:04.881
Fight when there's a big gap between what Ben Grins is grappling and GSPS

37
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.770
grappling.
Really big gap.
There's a big gap.
Shit.

38
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.570
Olympian.
Legitimate GSP.
Yeah.
GSP and aspirin.
Big Gap.
Yup.

39
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.840
If they wrestled,
that's great.
Okay.

40
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.010
Do you think y'all good Woodley [inaudible] Woodley GSP has more takedowns in

41
00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:25.790
UFC history.
You're right.

42
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.100
I never write a guide at the level of aspirin when it comes to wrestling.

43
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.000
He's the best guy.
He's a black belt in Jiu Jitsu.
No,
you're right.

44
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.100
If it gets to the ground,
the best,

45
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.470
the best guy he fought as far as wrestling credentials,

46
00:02:37.471 --> 00:02:40.560
who probably Josh Koscheck my,
yeah.

47
00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:45.430
My thought would be that GSP would never let,
oh,

48
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.650
he's doubled up too.
