WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.690
Only because of his daughter.
Yeah.
Cause I can relate to him just like,

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.700
just like I say this,
the store were,
were free reselling with the,
uh,

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.830
mental illness and stuff.
Like how people was mostly tired.

4
00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:15.210
Like I got emotionally tied to our teams because he was a father that dealt with

5
00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:17.460
a child with a disability as well as I,

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.660
so I know how hard it is to take care of children with disabilities.

7
00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:24.180
And I know it takes a lot of money,
you know,

8
00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:28.150
so I'm always for him,
you know,
I've,

9
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.430
I've been talking about him every since that time we fought,
win,
lose or draw.

10
00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:34.570
I would've still been talking about him because of the,

11
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.590
the emotional ties that I had with them.
I understand them.

12
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.490
And when you understand the person,
you root for that person,
no matter what,

13
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.270
no matter who's side you on,
whatever,
when a person has something,

14
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.740
you feel like it's worser than the next person.
Or you can relate,
you know,

15
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.720
you,
you,
you want them to win,
you know?
Now that's beautiful man.

16
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.700
And I think that,
uh,
having a guy like Ortiz,
uh,
as,
uh,

17
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.840
an opponent that's one of those fights that I think for a guy like you who

18
00:01:02.841 --> 00:01:05.300
doesn't have a lot of amateur experience,
when you,

19
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.290
when you fight a guy that's that seasoned and you get to see like what it looks

20
00:01:09.291 --> 00:01:09.980
like,

21
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.560
you get to see what it looks like when you're in the ring with a guy who's had

22
00:01:12.561 --> 00:01:17.450
just as you said,
300 plus amateur fights overall.
That's a,
I mean,

23
00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:20.930
that's an amazing learning opportunity,
right?
Oh,
most definitely.
Most definitely.

24
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.060
And um,
you know,
I just just had to confident that I was the,
I was the best.

25
00:01:26.061 --> 00:01:30.170
I was,
no matter what he had always going with that confident though I blocked

26
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.790
everything that,
um,
his accomplishments in that we knew what we was up against,

27
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.450
you know,
but,
you know,
they was calling him to the Boogie or the division.

28
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.170
And at that point of time I still needed to prove myself because,
you know,

29
00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:43.970
people still doubted me.
They,
you know,

30
00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:48.320
I've been down with me from the start of my career and I was like,

31
00:01:48.321 --> 00:01:51.920
since nobody don't want to fight them,
I want to bless him with this opportunity.

32
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.520
So these next moves that I made was to burn too then or teeth.

33
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.040
Then theory,
well there's to Vern highlight,

34
00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:03.530
knockout was one of the most ridiculous all time.

35
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.940
When you stand there with your hands down,
step forward and it's like,

36
00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:10.940
it was a comic book scene.
It's like the way you knocked him out.

37
00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:13.400
Like I said about like you've been a bad guy in the movie.

38
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.640
It seemed like you were a bad guy in a boxing movie.
It didn't make any sense.

39
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.550
You were the guy.
Like if I was say if there's someone that was a,

40
00:02:19.551 --> 00:02:23.270
I was a coach of a good guy and I was sitting ringside and I was watching you do

41
00:02:23.271 --> 00:02:27.440
that,
we'd be like,
Shit.
Yeah,
okay.
I'm going to tell you,
man.

42
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.220
When I stood over them like that,
I was outside of my body.

43
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.940
I could see me and him standing there and be like,
I was a third person.

44
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.090
I can't explain it.
You know?
And then when I started throwing the punches,

45
00:02:41.091 --> 00:02:45.020
like I went back into my body and start wailing on him or whatever.
I can't,

46
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.050
I can't explain that.
Why that feeling?

47
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.860
There's so many different things that happen.
One,
two,

48
00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:55.150
because that got shared so much online.
That was the start of it.

49
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.350
Millions and millions of people saw that online and they're like,

50
00:02:57.351 --> 00:03:01.420
what in the fuck is this guy got in his hands?
And that's when they started it.

51
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:04.290
Who is this guy?
We haven't heard about this guy before him.

52
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.080
It's like everybody's waking up to the heavyweight division.

53
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:11.170
All of a sudden it was so true and it was the perfect convert.
There it is.

54
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:14.560
I did dude play it from the beginning,
Jamie.
Here it goes.

55
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.560
Come on.
You know,
straight boxing skills.
You know,
I,
I got boxing skills.
You know,

56
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:23.680
when,
when I first photo,
I showed order it,
I stayed disciplined.

57
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.950
I didn't abandon the game plan and a,
you know,

58
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:29.470
and I showed people that I could box.
Yeah.
And he did.

59
00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:32.620
That was probably the only time I just really just stayed super disciplined.

60
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.500
Not despite,
but it's the first one.
This part right here.
This one right here.

61
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.620
I went outside of my body right here.
I was standing.
Then I came back.

62
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.610
I kid you not.
I don't know what the hell was going on with me.

63
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.420
That was ridiculous.
It was ridiculous.
No he did.

64
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.690
Yeah he was uh,
he was quite upset.

65
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.500
That's the strangest little concoction he's got on his dreadlocks there.
Yeah.

66
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.460
Look like tape.
Yeah,
that seems like that would get in the way.
They keep it up,

67
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.710
you know Haitians believe in that too.
That was,
that was sweet too.

68
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.200
Then.
Then the referee get gummy riff.
I don't really
know.

69
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.650
It would have been funny to the with the Lego and he wrote to the other corner

70
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.280
and talk about a movie that would have been,

71
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.960
but you know that fight right there was the real start of it all.
You know,

72
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.780
in terms of public perception.
Exactly.
Exactly.

73
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:25.300
I knew I was really going somewhere with that,

74
00:04:25.301 --> 00:04:29.890
especially when it went viral and then coming back with the rts.

75
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.120
Maybe cause the people,

76
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.190
it made that much more interesting to see what I'm going to do now.

77
00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:38.410
Cause people tuned in now whether they they love me or hate me,

78
00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:40.540
they tune in and see can I knock the next personnel.
