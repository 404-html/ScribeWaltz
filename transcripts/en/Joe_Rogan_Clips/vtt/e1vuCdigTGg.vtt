1
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.000
I see this side too.
There's another dark side of the marketplace though.

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.750
You know,
I think the news nowadays,
you know,

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.520
makes a lot of money on clickbait and,
and so you,
you now have companies,

4
00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:19.290
whether it's the Huffington Post or CNN or whatever who are less interested.

5
00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:23.400
It seems an objective reporting of the news and way more interested in

6
00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:25.290
generating clicks.

7
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.580
Did you feel fucking Newsweek title the,

8
00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:32.730
that they put out about Trump and the Nazis like stealing Christmas?

9
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.630
Did you see?
There you go.
That's a classic seed can find it.
What is that?

10
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.330
I'm already intrigued.
You know the news,

11
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.470
the world is such a public infotainment.

12
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.750
That's a tragedy.
Newsweek,

13
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.040
which you would always say there compete met.
They have to compete.

14
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.680
That's what it is.
They have to compete.
But you'd always think they're measured.

15
00:00:52.681 --> 00:00:55.980
They're intelligent.
This is Newsweek.
They get respected when,

16
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.120
when Chris Rock Dep,

17
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.560
when Chris was working on a bit how Trump and the Nazi stole Christmas to

18
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:06.050
promote white nationalism.
Hey,
fucking slow down.
Yeah.

19
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.010
This is just,
is there,

20
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.610
you're going to get Caitlyn Jenner elected president if you keep this shit up.

21
00:01:11.611 --> 00:01:13.710
Exactly.
Like you have to understand what's happening here.

22
00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:14.850
People are going to go nuts.

23
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.470
The media's approval rating the opposite according to some polls,
the media,

24
00:01:19.471 --> 00:01:22.470
his approval rating is in the single digits and I think they deserve it.

25
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.620
I really do.
I,
um,

26
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.380
am not nearly as cynical as a lot of people,

27
00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:30.780
but as I get older and I see how her responsible,

28
00:01:30.781 --> 00:01:33.810
a lot of the news is how much money there is to be made by just,

29
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.830
just hinting or sort of,
you know,

30
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.920
associating somebody's name with something kind of volatile shore product of

31
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.251
their environment.

32
00:01:47.251 --> 00:01:50.070
Like they're dealing with what gets a response and when it gets clicks.

33
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.580
So all good questions.
Societies are the ones who are telling them to do this.

34
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.460
They're not just making this shit up.
That's right.
Right?
They're like,
well,
if we,

35
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.480
if we say Trump,
the Nazi stole Christmas,
how many clicks are going to get?
See,

36
00:02:00.481 --> 00:02:03.360
but this is what they're doing is they're being more inclusive.
Hold on.

37
00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:05.070
They're being disingenuous here in this article.

38
00:02:05.071 --> 00:02:08.730
Scroll up a little bit because here's one of the things it says.
It says,

39
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.690
Donald Trump wants America to thank,
he reinvented Christmas.

40
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.110
We can say merry Christmas again.
He has said on numerous occasions,

41
00:02:16.111 --> 00:02:17.850
both during the campaign of president and presidency,

42
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.980
Christmases back better than ever before.

43
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.020
He told supporters month before the Christmas season,

44
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.040
fuck he is doing what a guy who's very persuasive does to try to get people on

45
00:02:27.721 --> 00:02:31.800
his camp.
He's a falcon.
Politicians got a sense of humor,
but it's not even true,

46
00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:32.640
but what,
what?

47
00:02:32.641 --> 00:02:36.660
What he's doing here is not even true because he in the past did a lot of tweets

48
00:02:36.661 --> 00:02:38.550
about happy holidays,
happy.

49
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.690
I like people pulled them up that he used to say happy holidays all the time,

50
00:02:42.691 --> 00:02:47.691
like really recently was tweeting happy holidays and then the idea that Obama

51
00:02:47.881 --> 00:02:50.260
never said merry Christmas is 100% horseshit.

52
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.310
There's a whole video of Obama saying merry Christmas,

53
00:02:53.311 --> 00:02:56.490
Merry Chris was over and it was wrong.
The Marianists miss nothing wrong with it.

54
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.480
This idea is he's trying to sell people on the idea that you,

55
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.640
your Christian values have been suppressed by this mediocre left wing government

56
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.080
and he's stepping in here to make America great again.
It's all a hustle,

57
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.910
but it's not white nationalists and Nazis.
Like you can't say Nazis.

58
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:17.911
The problem is when you say that you leave the word Nazi loses its fucking

59
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:20.980
meaning.
Yeah.
They're irresponsible journalists.
They're not journalists.

60
00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:25.690
They're irresponsible.
Yeah.
What he's doing is he's being a fucking politician.

61
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:29.440
He's been a weasel.
He's trying to pretend that Christmas was never,
we never,

62
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:30.540
we never had Christmas before.

63
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.030
We're going to have Christmas now and all the dopes,
all the yokels,
but

64
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.180
you know,
this guy's out there with make America great again.
Tattoos.

65
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.920
You just understand this.
This is real.

66
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.590
Like there's people with red hat tattoos that say,

67
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:48.280
make America great again on there's dummies every fucking quadrant of this
earth,

68
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.170
but do you know that?
I have to say that the mainstream media,
and I'm,

69
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.880
I know I'd never been a fan of Trump,

70
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.660
but the way they treat him with this kind of stuff that I constantly hear this

71
00:03:58.661 --> 00:04:02.380
petty shit.
The way it drinks water and stuff.
It's funny,

72
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:07.250
it's made me more sympathetic.
But when you drink water,
drink water like this

73
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.560
12 guys,
it's fucking,

74
00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:18.520
when you drink 12 diet cokes might be true or I don't believe it.
You know,

75
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.470
I don't know what to believe anymore.
That's the other problem.

76
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.240
There's another bunch of,

77
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.570
cause he quotes series of quotes from him from back in the day saying,

78
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:27.640
why would you drink that coke and drink diet coke?

79
00:04:27.641 --> 00:04:31.000
People drink diet coke or all salt fat diet coke makes you fat.
It's been proven.

80
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.350
There's a whole series of tweets.

81
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.760
Like he might've just forgot he made those tweets.
Well he shred.

82
00:04:34.761 --> 00:04:39.250
It just doesn't give a fuck.
Yeah,
but I think that,
you know,

83
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.550
first of all,
he as a president,
here's a weird one,

84
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.910
there was a terror attack that was thwarted by the FBI in San Francisco.

85
00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:49.570
You didn't hear a God damn peep about it because he's against the FBI because of

86
00:04:49.571 --> 00:04:53.260
this.
All this investigation shit.
So the president in the United States didn't,

87
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.960
it didn't like congratulate the FBI,

88
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.360
didn't tell the American people that the FBI had done a great job at the FBI.

89
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.450
I know,
I know about the terrorist attack.

90
00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:05.710
I read boarded a legitimate terrorists attacked and this is all this whole make

91
00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:08.110
America great again.
Stuff,
right?
If you want to stop the terrorists,

92
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.390
he is a political point.

93
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.830
He avoided this crazy guy is terrible.

94
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.300
Raj Arrest Man,

95
00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:20.110
suspected of plotting isis inspired Christmas terror attack in San Francisco.

96
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.110
It was a marine who would,
you know,
started going crazy.
Yeah.
Yeah.

97
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:31.170
Well it's just very handy.
It's very crazy.
And how about he started to,

98
00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.680
they,
they caught him.
He started to like,

99
00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:37.210
like isis post on Facebook and then he reached out to isis and went,
hey,

100
00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:41.560
look into complete this mission.
How do I get ahold of the guns and bullets?

101
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.820
Nicest.
Like homeboy,
if you have to ask for the gear,
might not be for you.

102
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.800
Like what the fuck?
They're dumb.

103
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.050
I go meet us on the dock where the asshole get out of here man.

104
00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.370
Y'All clog on your truck as you pull up.
Make it super obvious.

105
00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.911
Every time.

106
00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:01.730
I've been pier 39 and I've been there every time I go to San Francisco,

107
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:03.800
I always think that I'm always like,
I don't think like,

108
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:07.010
damn that's a lot of people though have been making this comment on why did the

109
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:08.510
president not discussed this?

110
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.090
Like well this is something that like when you address the nation,

111
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.080
you have to talk about it.

112
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.710
And even if he's in some sort of a squabble with one aspect of the FBI,

113
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.530
you have to recognize that they did their job here.

114
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.130
This is why they're doing a great job.
Yeah.
And this is why they're important.

115
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:27.220
Like the literally protected American lives and he's not mentioning it bullshit

116
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.850
that day.
Do when they're saying things like how Trump stole Christmas with white

117
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:36.170
nationalists and Nazis,
that petty,
that kind of petty shit and forces his petty.

118
00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.760
Yup.
Yup.
That's in a way of real news.
And they go at it.

119
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.870
They go at each other back and forth and nothing gets done.
So when these,

120
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.740
to grow the fuck up and it should be the president,
but he will weak.

121
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.040
She needs to grow the fuck up too.
You can't say things like that.
That's silly.

122
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.180
We,
we should be able to rely on the mainstream news,

123
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.900
and I know I'm going to get a lot emails about the main Eddie Bravo was calling

124
00:06:56.901 --> 00:06:58.530
you right now,
but we should be a little bit,

125
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.580
we should rely on them to at least report the facts,

126
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.120
at least objective facts.
That was the whole point of journalism.

127
00:07:05.121 --> 00:07:09.020
They were the fourth estate they keep,
they keep power in line.
They hold,

128
00:07:09.021 --> 00:07:12.200
they speak truth to power.
That's the whole idea.
In a democracy,

129
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.510
you need a free press.
You need,

130
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.700
but now with money ratings,
it has corrupted.
Well.
