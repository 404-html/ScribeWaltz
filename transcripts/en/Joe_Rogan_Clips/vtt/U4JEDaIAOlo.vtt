WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.470
So,
uh,
what do you got it from me?
So we were going to talk about,
yeah,
the uh,

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:07.650
I was wearing,

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.900
she told you because we talked last time about my book about depression,

4
00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:11.880
loss conditions and when things,

5
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:15.390
it was just as to me as we talk about the book I wrote about addiction and the

6
00:00:15.391 --> 00:00:20.360
war on drugs and really was that out last time you a book that came up for your

7
00:00:20.361 --> 00:00:20.580
sports,

8
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.190
just kind of in a new edition where there's loads of extra material particular

9
00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:26.490
about the opiate crisis and essentially cause so you added to it.
Yeah,

10
00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:29.980
loads of new stuff because the epics about five years old now and um,

11
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.880
although with loads of new stuff now,
but you know,

12
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.150
it was something I cared about for this really like personal reason that one of

13
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:39.510
my earliest memories is of trying to wake up one of my relatives and not,

14
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.530
not being able to,
I didn't,

15
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.830
I didn't understand why then because it was little boy.
But as I got older,

16
00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:45.360
I realized we had drug addiction in my family.

17
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.600
And it goes to the point where I was writing,
chasing the scream,

18
00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:51.150
my book about the drug war,
about,

19
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.600
I guess I started eight years ago and some of the people I love,

20
00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:57.540
we're in a really shitty condition,
terrible state.

21
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.090
And I was trying to figure out what to do.
Nothing I was doing was working.

22
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.910
I think I was doing,
was helping.
And I decided,
right,
okay,

23
00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:08.760
well there are lots of people all over the world are trying to deal with this

24
00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:11.430
problem.
I want to go and meet with them,
talk with them.

25
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.680
So I ended up going on this big journey.
It took three years.

26
00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:17.670
I traveled over 30,000 miles.
I wanted to sit with,
um,
you know,

27
00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:21.000
people who'd been through addiction actually led to a lot of other aspects of

28
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:22.710
the war on drugs.
It doesn't count as important as the,

29
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.730
what we do about addiction.
Um,

30
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.110
I don't want to sit with the places that had the harshest possible policies.

31
00:01:28.111 --> 00:01:30.340
Like we mentioned,
Arizona where I went out with this,

32
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.890
these women were made to go out on chain gangs and they're humiliated and,
and,

33
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.460
and tormented Vietnam where they make people with addiction problems go into

34
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.940
literally forced labor camps and the places that had the most compassionate

35
00:01:41.941 --> 00:01:45.360
possible policies like Portugal where they decriminalized all drugs when

36
00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:48.750
incredible results.
Switzerland where they legalized heroin,
incredible results.

37
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.710
Um,
and I guess I ended up just spending so much time.

38
00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:56.400
It's such a crazy mixture of people from a transgendered crack dealer in

39
00:01:56.401 --> 00:01:59.790
Brooklyn who ended up actually being one of the smartest people I know to a hit

40
00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:02.910
man for the deadliest Mexican drug cartel who's definitely not one of the

41
00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:05.580
smartest people I know.
And I learned loads of things.

42
00:02:05.581 --> 00:02:10.140
But I guess the heart of what I learned is just so much of what we've been told

43
00:02:10.141 --> 00:02:11.310
about this for so long.

44
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.370
It's now 100 years since we started fighting the war on drugs in this country

45
00:02:14.371 --> 00:02:16.140
and it was then imposed on the rest of the world.

46
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.260
So much of what we're told is wrong.
Drugs aren't what we think they are.

47
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.100
Addiction isn't what we think is the war on drugs isn't what we think it is.

48
00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:25.860
And the alternatives to the war on drugs aren't what we think they are.

49
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.920
So in some ways it's kind of daunting to Rick go all over the world and realize

50
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.980
so much of what we take for granted isn't right.

51
00:02:31.981 --> 00:02:35.640
But that opens up this whole exciting other set of possibilities.

52
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.490
The main reason why people assumed that people do drugs just to escape reality.

53
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.890
Um,
what do you think is the primary thing that they're running from?

54
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.660
So you've got to separate out two things.

55
00:02:48.661 --> 00:02:52.620
And this surprised me cause my family's experience was pretty bad and

56
00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:55.890
catastrophic addiction.
But most drug use,

57
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.660
even the main drug war body in the world,

58
00:02:57.661 --> 00:03:02.620
the UN Office of drug control admits that 90% of all currently banned drug use

59
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.150
is what they call non problematic.

60
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:06.580
So the person isn't addicted and it doesn't damage their health,
right?

61
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.460
So 90% so let's set that aside.
We'll come back to that.
Okay.

62
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.060
There's like 90% that's recreational use where people use because it makes their

63
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:17.930
lives better.
Then you've got the 10 coffee sip of wine or,
or uh,

64
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.110
oh boy,
NRC or a whole range of a whole range of currently cannabis,

65
00:03:22.111 --> 00:03:24.280
a whole range of currently illegal drugs.
Um,

66
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.040
in most cases there are some people who have addictions to cannabis,

67
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.710
but you said that you don't got,
got to ask,

68
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:33.370
well what's happening with this 10% who have got a problem?
Right?

69
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:34.204
What's going on?

70
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.480
And one of the things that really blew my mind in the research for chasing the

71
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:41.530
scream was realizing I had deeply misunderstood what addiction is.

72
00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:44.980
I had misunderstood the thing I thought I had been seeing in front of me since I

73
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:47.200
was a kid.
Right?
So most people,

74
00:03:47.201 --> 00:03:50.920
let's think about heroin addiction because it was close to me.
Most people,

75
00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:55.360
if we stop the next 20 people to walk past your,
you know,
your,
your studio.

76
00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:57.580
And we said to them,
what Causes Heroin Addiction?

77
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.790
I think they'd look at us like we were stupid.
And they'd say,
well,

78
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:04.780
the clue's in the name dip shit,
right?
Heroin causes her.
In addition,

79
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.400
we've been told this story for a hundred years.
It's become totally part of our,

80
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.410
our common sense,
right?
We think if we took the,

81
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.270
we took the next 20 people after that,

82
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.470
he walked past the studio and we injected them all with heroin everyday for a

83
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.500
month.
At the end of that month,
they'd all be heroin addicts for simple reason.

84
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:24.760
There's chemical hooks in heroin that their bodies would start to desperately

85
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:26.290
physically need.
Um,

86
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.080
and we think that a lot of people think that's what addiction is,
right?

87
00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:33.460
It's this physical hunger for the chemical hook inside the drug,
right?

88
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.540
Um,
there is some reality to chemical hooks.
They exist.
They're real,

89
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.380
but that's actually a very small part of what's going on.

90
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.890
The first thing that alerted me to the fact there's something wrong with that

91
00:04:44.891 --> 00:04:48.850
story we've been told is when it was explained to me by loads of doctors in

92
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:49.810
Britain,
where I'm from,

93
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.830
if you step out into the street and you get hit by a truck and you break your

94
00:04:53.831 --> 00:04:57.400
hip,
you'll be taken to hospital and you'll be given loads of a drug called

95
00:04:57.401 --> 00:05:01.360
diamorphine.
Diamorphine is heroin,
right?
It's the medical name,
Vera minutes.

96
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.360
The stuff you'll be given in a hospital is much better than the shit you buy on

97
00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:07.690
the street because it's medically pure,
it's not contaminated.

98
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.570
And if what we think about addiction is right,

99
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.570
that it's just caused by exposure to the drug,

100
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.840
what should be happening to all these people in British hospitals who have been

101
00:05:16.841 --> 00:05:19.510
given loads of heroin,
right?
Anyone watching this podcast,

102
00:05:19.511 --> 00:05:22.900
he's got a British grandmother who's had a hip replacement operation.

103
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.180
Your grandmother's taken a shit ton of heroin,
right?

104
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.070
And if what we think is right,

105
00:05:27.071 --> 00:05:30.400
the addiction is caused primarily by exposure to the chemical hooks,

106
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.340
lines of these people should believe in hospital and trying to score on the

107
00:05:33.341 --> 00:05:36.940
streets,
right?
This has been studied very Catholic.
Virtually never happens,
right?

108
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.650
And when I learned that,
it just seems so weird to me.

109
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.410
I thought it couldn't possibly be true,
right?
How could it be?

110
00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:48.640
You've got someone in a hospital bed who's taking loads of really potent heroin.

111
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.730
They don't become addicted.
And in the alleyway outside,

112
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.680
you've got someone who's using a actually a weaker form of the drug who becomes

113
00:05:56.681 --> 00:05:58.820
addicted.
How can,
how can that be?
What's happening here?

114
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.100
And I only began to understand it when I,

115
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.690
when I went to Vancouver and met this amazing man could professor Bruce

116
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.720
Alexander who did an experiment that's really transformed how we think about

117
00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:09.770
addiction all over the world.

118
00:06:09.771 --> 00:06:12.440
It's led to a new way of thinking and loads of new evidence.

119
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.250
So professor Alexander explained to me this story that we'd been told,
right?

120
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.420
The addiction is caused by the chemical hooks primarily comes from a series of

121
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:22.670
experiments that were done earlier in the 20th century.

122
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.080
They're really simple experiments.

123
00:06:24.081 --> 00:06:27.260
Your viewers can try them at home if they're feeling a little bit shitty today,

124
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:28.830
right?
You take a rat,

125
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.420
you put it in a cage and you give it two water bottles.

126
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.620
One is just water and the other is water laced with either heroin or cocaine.

127
00:06:36.621 --> 00:06:40.130
You might remember in the 1980s there's a famous partnership for drug free

128
00:06:40.131 --> 00:06:43.040
America ad that's,
that shows this experiment,
right?

129
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.830
And the rat in this cage starts to drink.

130
00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:50.831
The PF always prefers the heroin water and almost always kills itself within a

131
00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:54.350
week or two,
right?
So there you go.
That's,
that's our story.
The,

132
00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.760
you're exposed to the drug,
it takes you over and then you just die,
right?

133
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.090
But in the 70s professor Alexander comes along and says,

134
00:07:02.091 --> 00:07:05.260
he was working with people with addiction problems and he's like,
well,

135
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:06.103
hang on a minute.

136
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.430
We put these rats alone in an empty cage.

137
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.880
They've got nothing that makes life meaningful for rats,
right?

138
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.920
What would happen if we did this differently?

139
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.680
So he built a cage that he called rat park,

140
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:22.430
which is basically like heaven Veracyte's,
right?
They've got loads of friends.

141
00:07:22.431 --> 00:07:25.490
They've got as a cheese,
they got as a colored balls,
they can have loads of sex.

142
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.730
Anything arap finds meaningful in life is there in rat park.

143
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.260
And they've got both the water bottles,
the normal water and the drug water.

144
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.100
And of course they try both.
They don't know what's in them.

145
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.480
This is the fascinating thing in rat park,
they don't like the Waterbury much.

146
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.020
None of them ever use it compulsively.
The heroin,
the heroin,
water,

147
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.320
none of them ever use it compulsively.
None of them have overdose.

148
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:50.470
So you go from almost 100% compulsive use and death by overdose when their lives

149
00:07:50.541 --> 00:07:52.730
are shitty to none.

150
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.400
When they have the things that make life meaningful and has loads of human

151
00:07:55.401 --> 00:07:58.040
examples.
I'm sure we'll,
we'll we'll talk about,
but the,

152
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.490
the main thing I took from this is that the opposite of addiction is not

153
00:08:01.491 --> 00:08:03.500
sobriety.
The opposite of addiction is connection.

154
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.580
We have to ask ourselves what are the contexts in which people become addicted?

155
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:11.120
Because there are some contexts where people find these drugs extremely

156
00:08:11.121 --> 00:08:14.840
addictive and there are some context where they don't become addicted at all.

157
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.510
There's something,
the drug plays a role.
Chemical Hooks are real.

158
00:08:18.511 --> 00:08:20.780
I can talk about how we know that they play some role,

159
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.700
but they're actually a surprisingly small role of what's going on.

160
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:26.030
Small amount of what's going on.
We know this from,

161
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:27.080
I mean there's so many examples,

162
00:08:27.081 --> 00:08:30.470
but could you give me another one in at the same time as rat park,

163
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.520
there was an experiment going on that everyone listens to this repetitive,

164
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:38.630
the Vietnam War,
right?
In Vietnam,
shitloads of American troops were using heroin,

165
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.270
right?
It was very easy to get it out of there.
They'd actually insanely,

166
00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:44.570
they had cracked down on cannabis and so people would move to heroin because

167
00:08:44.571 --> 00:08:47.840
sniffer dogs can't detect,
um,
heroin disease lays cannabis.

168
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:51.770
So calories was everywhere.
Sorry.
Uh,
heroin is everywhere.

169
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.450
Loads of American troops were using it.

170
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:56.850
And if you look at what people said at the time,
the authorities,

171
00:08:56.851 --> 00:08:59.850
the Nixon White House,
they were shitting themselves cause they're like,

172
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.020
they believe this chemical hooks theory of addiction.
So they're like,
fuck,

173
00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:06.450
when this Warren's,
we can have,
you know,

174
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.750
half a million heroin addicts on the streets of the United States.

175
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.760
There's a really good study that followed these,

176
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:16.790
these men home and it found that the vast majority of them just stopped,

177
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.260
right?
They didn't go into then go to rehab.

178
00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:21.690
Most of them that didn't go into horrific withdrawal.

179
00:09:21.691 --> 00:09:26.040
Some of them had an uncomfortable flu like symptoms,
but most of them just stop.

180
00:09:26.041 --> 00:09:29.760
Now,
if you believe this old theory that chemical hooks take you over,

181
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:31.530
that makes no sense.

182
00:09:31.531 --> 00:09:35.010
But if you understand what professor Alexander is saying and that all the new

183
00:09:35.011 --> 00:09:37.740
evidence about addiction that I go through and chasing the scream,

184
00:09:37.741 --> 00:09:42.090
it makes it makes perfect sense,
right?
You,
me,

185
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.010
everyone in this area,

186
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:49.040
if I took any of us and put us in a horrific pestilential jungle where we don't

187
00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:49.681
want to be,

188
00:09:49.681 --> 00:09:52.470
and I made you kill a load of people and potentially die at any moment,

189
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.700
you would find heroin much more appealing than you do now,
right?

190
00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.760
If we want to understand why people turn to painkillers,

191
00:09:59.761 --> 00:10:03.740
we've got to understand why they're in pain,
right?
Um,
and,
and the,

192
00:10:03.741 --> 00:10:05.940
the core of addiction it's made me,

193
00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.610
I learned from these amazing experts all over the world,
the,

194
00:10:08.611 --> 00:10:09.990
the core of addiction.

195
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.370
It's about not wanting to be present in your life because your life is too

196
00:10:14.371 --> 00:10:17.220
painful,
a place to be.
And once you understand that,

197
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.550
you can see why what we've been doing is such a disaster,
right?

198
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.820
Cause the theory we have with the war on drugs.
Think about Arizona.

199
00:10:23.821 --> 00:10:25.980
We can talk about that more,
but I,
you know,
like I say,

200
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:30.570
I went to this nightmare prison it Estrella prison in,

201
00:10:30.571 --> 00:10:35.130
in Phoenix,
Arizona,
where people are humiliated.
And the theory behind that,

202
00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.460
part of the theory behind the war on drugs is if you've got people who are

203
00:10:38.461 --> 00:10:41.850
addicted,
you got to inflict pain on them to,
you know,

204
00:10:41.851 --> 00:10:43.830
give them an incentive to stop,
right?

205
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:48.270
But once you understand that pain is in fact the fuel of addiction is in fact

206
00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:50.040
the primary cause of addiction.

207
00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:54.600
You can see why sometimes people say that doesn't work.
Truth is much worse.

208
00:10:54.601 --> 00:10:56.490
Right?
That makes addiction worse.

209
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.820
Those women I went out with and spent all that time with who were,
you know,

210
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.800
humiliate.
I remember in that prison,

211
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:06.360
we come back from being on the chain gang where they have to,

212
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.420
sometimes they have to dig graves.
They weren't doing that the day I was there.

213
00:11:09.421 --> 00:11:13.290
They had to collect garbage the day I was one of the days I was there.

214
00:11:13.291 --> 00:11:18.291
But we come back and normally with prisons as a journalist,

215
00:11:19.021 --> 00:11:21.000
they don't want to show you anything,
right?
You're like,

216
00:11:21.001 --> 00:11:23.970
you have to kind of really finagle to get them to show you anything in this

217
00:11:23.971 --> 00:11:28.260
prison.
Um,
it's like a pantomime of cruelty.
They wanna show it to you.

218
00:11:28.261 --> 00:11:30.210
The whole point is to humiliate these people,
right?

219
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.870
So the women I've been talking to in the men were really terrified of what they

220
00:11:33.871 --> 00:11:38.550
called the whole right is the solitary blog.
And so I said to the gods,

221
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.650
will you show me the whole,
I'm sure they say no.
They're like,
yeah,
sure.

222
00:11:40.651 --> 00:11:43.470
Come on Australia.
So go around to the whole,

223
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.810
and these women who put up the most like trivial infractions,

224
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:52.110
like having a cigarette is literally a hole,
right?
It's like a concrete block.

225
00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:53.770
You're on your own.
There's nothing in it.

226
00:11:53.771 --> 00:11:57.830
There's a tiny window where you can see sunlight,
no TV,
nothing.
Um,

227
00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:01.210
and I remember speaking to a woman who was in this and suddenly thinking,

228
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:07.380
this is the closest you could get to an exact human recreation of the cages that

229
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:12.340
guaranteed addiction in rats.
Right?
And this is what we're doing,

230
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:15.010
thinking it will stop these women being addicted.

231
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:19.180
It's that the system we've built,
a doctor,
Gabor Martay,

232
00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.320
an amazing guy said to me,
you know,
if negative consequences stopped addiction,

233
00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:25.480
there won't be a single addict in the world.
Ryan,

234
00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:27.790
what have people with addiction problems not suffered?

235
00:12:27.791 --> 00:12:31.090
What humiliation have they not endured?
So we've got this,

236
00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.420
I think we've got to really shift a perspective on what addiction is.

237
00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:36.820
And there are places that have done this that have led to incredible results.

238
00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:38.410
<v 1>The,</v>

239
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:42.740
I love that rat experiment one because that had always been parodied as this is

240
00:12:42.741 --> 00:12:46.280
the proof positive that these drugs are so terrible for you.

241
00:12:46.281 --> 00:12:49.220
But once they figured out that if you take those rats and put them in a

242
00:12:49.221 --> 00:12:51.350
wonderful place and they don't have addiction,

243
00:12:51.351 --> 00:12:54.860
it really does make you step back and go,
okay,
what is exactly going on here?

244
00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:56.300
Obviously there's chemical hooks.

245
00:12:56.301 --> 00:13:01.070
They are real like people that are on sustained prolonged use of opiates,

246
00:13:01.071 --> 00:13:04.970
especially people with back injuries have an incredibly difficult time kicking

247
00:13:04.971 --> 00:13:09.770
them,
even really positive people who don't necessarily have awful lives.
But,
um,

248
00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:14.870
it's,
it's one of those things that gets in your head and then you sort of,
it,

249
00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.270
you,
you've,
you've heard it,
you repeat it.

250
00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:22.640
But it's the reason why I asked you the question.
It's like,
what,
what is,

251
00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:26.390
what is the cause for most people,
you believe it's,
uh,

252
00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:31.450
an unfulfilled life or a painful life or painful self image or remorse for your

253
00:13:34.941 --> 00:13:37.000
past?
Or like what is it that,

254
00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:42.050
do we have like primary reasons or primary attributes that we attach to these

255
00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:45.163
people that are drug?

256
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:48.810
<v 0>Yeah,
so this was what my more recent book,
which is called loss connections,</v>

257
00:13:48.811 --> 00:13:51.570
uncovering the real causes of depression and the unexpected solutions is,

258
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:55.020
is about,
cause I think the core of addiction is,

259
00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:57.120
it's about trying to deal with pain,
right?

260
00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.090
But the causes of human pain are obviously huge.

261
00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:05.580
But what I learned is the scientific evidence for nine causes a kind of deep

262
00:14:05.581 --> 00:14:07.860
despair right now.

263
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.890
If you think about depression and it's very similar factors play out with

264
00:14:10.891 --> 00:14:14.930
addiction,
they're actually densely interconnected,
um,
uh,
phenomena.
But,
um,

265
00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.280
there are real biological factors,
right?

266
00:14:17.281 --> 00:14:19.020
Your genes can make you more vulnerable to that.

267
00:14:19.021 --> 00:14:21.750
Just like some people find it easier to put on weight than others.
Um,

268
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.020
and there are real brain changes that happen when you become depressed or

269
00:14:25.021 --> 00:14:27.510
addicted.
That can make it harder to get out.
Right?

270
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:31.140
But at most of the factors that are causing this,

271
00:14:31.141 --> 00:14:35.490
despair are not factors in our biology.
There factors in the way we live.

272
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:36.543
I think it's a kind of,

273
00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.840
this doesn't cover all of the causes that I learned about Veloce connections,

274
00:14:39.841 --> 00:14:41.100
but it comes a lot of them.

275
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.520
Everyone watching your show knows they have natural physical needs,
obviously,

276
00:14:44.521 --> 00:14:48.930
right?
You need food,
you need water,
you need shelter,
you need cleaner.

277
00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:52.400
Exactly.
If I took those things away from you,
you'd fucked pretty quickly.
Right?

278
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.170
But there's equally strong evidence.

279
00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:57.950
The all human beings have natural psychological needs,
right?
You need to feel,

280
00:14:57.951 --> 00:15:01.160
you belong.
You need to fill.
Your life has meaning and purpose.

281
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.400
You need to feel that people see you and value you.
You need to be,

282
00:15:04.401 --> 00:15:06.170
you've got a future that makes sense.

283
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.690
And this culture we've built is good at lots of things,

284
00:15:08.691 --> 00:15:10.820
and I'm really glad to be alive today for all sorts of reasons.

285
00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:13.340
Had to go to the dentist the other day.
I'm glad to be alive now,

286
00:15:13.341 --> 00:15:14.330
not like a hundred years ago,

287
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.050
