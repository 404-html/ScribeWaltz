1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.530
Now when you train for the Mayweather fight,
what,
first of all,

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.590
how much time did you have to prepare for that for 10 weeks to the day?

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.940
That doesn't seem like a lot.
No,
no.
I remember just getting the,

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.800
getting the message.
Do you think that that was calculated and Floyd's part?
Uh,

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.920
maybe he's a very smart guy because it seems like most of his fights or planned

6
00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:23.910
way in advance,
but that one was like what?
It's a couple of months away.

7
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.520
Just sort of half in.
Yeah.
Yeah,
it was,
was it August?

8
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.590
Is that when the fight took place?
And it was August.
August,
yeah.

9
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.550
And so I remember hearing about it and thinking of like,
wait,
wait,
August.

10
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.450
That's fucking really close.
Right?
Like for a Mayweather fight,

11
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.350
you would think six weeks or six months or something along those lines.

12
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:45.351
But I would feel like for Floyd is as great as he is and probably the best ever

13
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.460
in terms of boxing technique and not being hit.
I mean,
he's so elusive,

14
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.990
still really wouldn't want a guy like Conor preparing for a long period of time.

15
00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:58.820
It really getting acclimated.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,

16
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.280
it was kind of funny how that all came about because when he fought Eddie in

17
00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:04.140
November,
the year before,

18
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.340
I remember shortly after that we were at a function and I kind of pulled him

19
00:01:08.341 --> 00:01:12.030
aside and I shook his hand and said,
right,
you're doing all the best,

20
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.710
enjoy the rest of your life.

21
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.650
And he was kind of shocked it was saying this to him,
but I said,

22
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:19.350
what else are you going to do you,
you're the two h champion.
You've,

23
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.860
you've got out the other end of this grind,
this,

24
00:01:22.861 --> 00:01:24.970
this meat grinder with no damage.
You,

25
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.330
you're in a very small percentage and you've,

26
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.200
you've made plenty of money often enjoy yourself.
And then,

27
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.930
and then telling my past couple of months went past and then this,

28
00:01:33.931 --> 00:01:37.230
the Mayweather fights start talking and I could,

29
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.640
I could understand that because now his grandkids were going to be financially

30
00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:45.120
secure.
So it made sense because it was a big pay day.

31
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.910
It didn't really make sense for any other reason.
He enjoyed it.

32
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.200
The competition side of it.

33
00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:51.930
That's no matter what you're doing Makonnen it's going to be competition.

34
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.440
I don't care what it is he's going to look.
How quick did you do that?

35
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.520
You're like,
oh,
it's been for pis.
Yeah,
I'll do a quicker.
He's just that way,

36
00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:01.770
so it didn't start having a bit of a back and forth.
He's like,
yeah,
okay,

37
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.500
let's put the boxing and be the best boxer in the world.
And for me,
my second,

38
00:02:05.501 --> 00:02:07.320
you know,
I was on the outside go,
okay,

39
00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:10.590
I understand what you know that makes sense to do and nothing else was really

40
00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:13.470
making sense at the time.
It's going to be damaging.

41
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.240
Boxing is a horrendous for to prepare for and to compete in because we're just

42
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.620
looking at one thing,
really punches to the head,
you know?

43
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.330
Of course it's a buddy's house as well,
but,
but it's,
it's so damaging.

44
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.480
The only justification I can see for that was,
you know,

45
00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:30.420
your grandkids are financially set.
Yeah.
Tremendous,

46
00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:34.920
tremendous hype behind a tremendous amount of money.
Did you think he could win?

47
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.470
I,
of course,
I'm a,
I'm,
I'm always gone to think that way.
You know that,

48
00:02:39.471 --> 00:02:43.090
that's my mindset.
Let's that's prepare as best we can.
It's,
it's,

49
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.280
it's their options here.
Um,
when he landed that uppercut in the first round,

50
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.710
what did you think?
Yeah.
Like even when he went out to do that.
So,
you know,

51
00:02:52.711 --> 00:02:56.010
we did a whole training camp and we brought in,
you probably heard,

52
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.290
we probably haven't even thought about.

53
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.780
And that was my first ever seen them against the,
uh,

54
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.320
recognize boxer cause in the gym we have a local guys really happened in those

55
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:07.470
sparring sessions.
Cause what we got to see,
the,

56
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.720
the clip that was released was Connor lighting mal analogy up.

57
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.380
But Paulie Malignaggi insists that most of the sparring was him dominating.

58
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.060
Now that's not what I saw.
Um,
you know,
when we,
when he,
when he came back from it,

59
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:26.160
like he did it a spar,
he went away,
it all broke because he had a picture,

60
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.240
got leaked.
And then he'd,
Paul,
he did a lot of interviews.

61
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:32.560
He was on the East Coast,
uh,
work in a show.
So when he came back,
he came back,

62
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.570
it was coming back to have a fight.
And it was actually,

63
00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:38.250
it was a weird night in the gym because,
uh,
the,
the Fatina rotors come in,

64
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.860
Dana Command was a few celebrities command.
It was a fight,
you know,
and,
and,

65
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:43.660
and the,
the referee was there.

66
00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:48.430
Joe Cretae is a great guy and they did 12 hard rounds.
And I do it,

67
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.960
I think there is something being released on Netflix soon at documentary based

68
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:56.560
around our fight and it will have all the,
have all the rounds.
So I guess really,

69
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.130
yeah,
I mean we have,
of course we have the rounds.
We have to 12 rounds and a,

70
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:03.760
it's,
as far as I'm aware,
I just actually did an interview for a recently there.

71
00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:06.400
I think it's the tree park documentary that's going to be on Netflix soon.

72
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.160
And uh,
so people will get to make up their own minds about it.

73
00:04:09.161 --> 00:04:10.900
But just going back to the fight.

74
00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:15.220
So what did you think though about the sparring when he walked in?

75
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.170
When they walked out first and I went to myself,

76
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.700
I've no idea what's going to happen.

77
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.540
I seen unboxing amateurs back home and some pros,
I,
I'm,

78
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:25.450
I'm horrendously ignorant to the boxing world.
I just,

79
00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:28.630
I just don't really follow it.
And he was schooling those guys and I was like,

80
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.230
yeah,
but they're in a world champion,
you know,
then at that elite level.

81
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.010
So that night when he went into the ring of Paul,
I was like,
you know,

82
00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:38.380
me and Owen are kind of like,
what's going to happen here?
Is He,

83
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.100
is he just going to get too old?
And then we have to scratch our heads and go,

84
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.140
shit,
we're going to do here.

85
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.210
But he came back after the rounds and me and him were gone.
We wait a second,

86
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.630
it's not magic.
It's still punching in its range and there's techniques.
And

87
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.020
so I got,
my confidence was growing,
my confidence was growing.
I knew it.
I knew,

88
00:04:59.021 --> 00:05:02.350
no matter what happened,
who's going to be a good fight,
I wasn't going to be,

89
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.040
you know,
you could win and just,
this looks terrible.

90
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.760
He's missing whatever you shard and he's being made look silly.
What was it?

91
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.710
A good fight?
You know,
it's entertaining.

92
00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:14.230
I think no one in the crowd was saying that was ridiculous.

93
00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:16.860
No one was saying that was a waste of money.
It was,

94
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.230
it was an entertaining fight and it's going to be one of those things that I'll

95
00:05:20.231 --> 00:05:24.280
be an older man than I am now and I'll be talking about the time we went into

96
00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:25.810
the boxing world and for flight,

97
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.090
even though the night I was kind of just look at it scratching me,

98
00:05:28.091 --> 00:05:33.070
what am I doing here?
You know,
that's Floyd Mayweather and his dad over there.

99
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.360
These are guys that,
you know,

100
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.870
of all the boxes I always preferred watch in Floyd and anyone else because I

101
00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:38.704
love defense.

102
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.360
Defense to me is the most intriguing part and him and Tony and uh,
those,

103
00:05:43.361 --> 00:05:46.720
those type of guys.
And that,
that's how we worked the Philly shell and it was,

104
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.550
it's beautiful.
It's so interesting to watch and getting on a bit,
um,

105
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.940
but still able to compete so fanatic this,
his whole career was defensive space.

106
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.810
Everybody took the shots and they were never was damaging to gym.

107
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.950
There was damage in fights.
But yeah,

108
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:05.240
when he was in the ring and working in the corner in air corner,
I'm just going,

109
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:09.260
what the hell is Connor doing?
Fight and flight.
This is just strange.

110
00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:11.820
Even even at the beginning,
you know,
and so he used to Bruce boyfriend,

111
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.080
it was a different guy and he hit the bell three times.
I was like,
Oh yeah,

112
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.080
you do that in the rocky movies.
I remember that thing.
Ding,

113
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.170
ding ladies and down kind of the beginning of the ceremonial and I was like,

114
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.530
Oh shit that they're actually going to parks,
you know?
Right,
right,

115
00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:27.710
right until the end of it.
It was still just head scratching and then,
you know,

116
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:30.710
flight coming over at the end and given us a little compliment.
You know,

117
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:33.140
he's got a hell of a Shawn and he's tough as nails and it was just,

118
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.020
it was a great experience.
I wouldn't do anything different.

119
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.740
It's the Polamalu Nrg sparring session,
which you said was like a fight.

120
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:44.120
If it was scored as a fight,
you think Connor would have won the fight?
Um,
yeah,

121
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.420
of course I want to say yes and we'll say,
well no,
everybody was there and the,

122
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.970
I had asked Dane Actually Dana,

123
00:06:50.971 --> 00:06:54.830
those a lot more about boxing the media than I do and all of those guys were

124
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:57.710
going,
okay,
we have a fight on our hands here.
This is going to be,

125
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.650
this is going to be an interesting contest.
So yeah I buy,

126
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:02.870
I'm of course going to say,

127
00:07:02.871 --> 00:07:06.020
yeah I guess people will sit around and make up their own mind but it wasn't as

128
00:07:06.021 --> 00:07:06.561
one side.

129
00:07:06.561 --> 00:07:09.940
It is those clips that were released where it's kind of course of course Polly

130
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.240
behind his shots as well.

131
00:07:11.241 --> 00:07:15.650
Of course he's a brilliant boxer was for me as a trainer it was,

132
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.510
it was amazing looking at me and he does that.

133
00:07:17.511 --> 00:07:21.170
He's put on a little bit of way easy and you still have to go 12 rounds because

134
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.290
after about round four was gone and he's not going to continue her cause he's

135
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.510
breeding very heavy and he'd been hit hard and he'd been sat down once and

136
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.110
whether it was a push or a poem,
shoot,

137
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.880
you guys can make up your own mind adapt but a lot of heavy shots and I'm

138
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:33.740
thinking he's going to be able to here by six.

139
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.190
So we had another sparring partner ready and I was like,
okay,

140
00:07:37.191 --> 00:07:40.470
just be ready to go cause I think this will go about six rounds.
And then Paul,

141
00:07:40.471 --> 00:07:43.370
you just hit this rhythm and start running his own shots and it turned out to be

142
00:07:43.371 --> 00:07:44.900
a great,
a great content.

143
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.150
You know it's a contest because it wasn't a spiral they were talking to all
time.

144
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.430
Paul,
he was talking to me,
he was talking to the camera man he talked to,

145
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.410
he was almost better than Conrad.
It was great to watch.

146
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:58.650
Everybody had a great night and I think they bill actually bizarrely enjoyed it

147
00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.670
like Kinda or an aid.
It's Batman.
And the joker,
like,
you know,

148
00:08:01.671 --> 00:08:04.220
they both need each other children below regenerated.

149
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.880
It's a weird dynamic when you,
when you see a contest like that.
Well Paul,

150
00:08:07.881 --> 00:08:12.620
he was campaigning for a fight.
Yeah.
He's trying to get Connor to,
to box him.

151
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:17.270
Yeah.
I've,
it's not out of the realms of possibilities real.

152
00:08:17.271 --> 00:08:19.770
It's absolutely an outer realms of possibilities.
There's,

153
00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.900
there's all sorts of crazy rumors going around the managing team and the fight

154
00:08:23.901 --> 00:08:27.740
team and,
and what might happen next?
It could be boxing and cook.
It could be him,

155
00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:31.610
it could be Floyd,
Floyd again,
I,
we've all sorts of names being thrown around.

156
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.720
Well,
one thing that happened in the fight there was undeniable.

157
00:08:34.721 --> 00:08:38.750
So Konner started to fade and we've talked about this,
that the endurance issue.

158
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:43.350
Like what,
what do you think is that issue?
Well,
it certainly in,

159
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:45.260
in that fight,
you could see,

160
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:51.430
and what I learned too about it was it was just brilliant to watch Floyd how he

161
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:52.610
managed his energy.

162
00:08:52.611 --> 00:08:55.920
I think it's one punch in real warm and maybe not much more around too.

163
00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.780
He was just so,
you know,
it's such an amazing strategy.
And then,

164
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.720
and then switching from the usual style to kind of does hands up.

165
00:09:03.721 --> 00:09:07.690
I'm walking in and,
and Connor did on load a lot on his forms,

166
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:09.600
very inefficient,

167
00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:12.870
which is the opposite of what I would describe Connors fighting style,

168
00:09:12.871 --> 00:09:16.020
these efficient,
very few shots,
maximum return.

169
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.250
This was a lots of punches and it was one of the few bits of advice I gave them

170
00:09:20.251 --> 00:09:22.860
in the corner that was of any use because I'm not a boxing guy,

171
00:09:22.861 --> 00:09:25.740
was let's pick a show and there's a reason why he's not trying to anything.

172
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.020
You don't try anything.
This is 12 rounds.

173
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:32.240
It's almost like this tree parts to a fight as one to forward his five to uh,

174
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:36.720
Asian.
Then there's nine to 12 and fly just worked out beautifully and there'd be

175
00:09:36.721 --> 00:09:40.810
something that we would definitely do a lot more if we were to ever get a boxing

176
00:09:40.811 --> 00:09:44.910
fight.
It was recognized that as 12 rounds,
pace yourself.
He was,

177
00:09:44.911 --> 00:09:48.210
he was kind of in the MMA mode of the big shots and late the guy up.

178
00:09:48.211 --> 00:09:51.300
But Floyd's the best in the world not being lit up.

179
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:55.410
Do you think it's a pacing issue and not an endurance issue?
I think it's both.

180
00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:00.500
Um,
it's specifically for the boxing.
Yeah,
it was,
it was,

181
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:04.650
there was pacing and endurance in a new field.

182
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:08.580
No clench work at all.
We had a few little kind of funny clinched techniques.

183
00:10:08.581 --> 00:10:12.780
We were going to try out hammer fist to the back of the head.
There was a,

184
00:10:12.781 --> 00:10:14.290
well he was aiming for a decided ahead.

185
00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.710
It was supposed to be like at the anal weed.

186
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.560
We played around with little stretches of the rules and we'd see what Joe

187
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.090
Cortese pulls up on and could we do a little,
you know I,

188
00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:24.930
I'm a chunk are fine as well and you need comes from wrestling and you see him

189
00:10:24.931 --> 00:10:28.800
doing kind of what almost look like arm drags and,
and,
and tie ups and stuff.

190
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.510
So we were trying to use that and we've just got broke every time we,

191
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.070
we had very little opportunity to kind of,
you know,

192
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.330
even going towards the back and holding the hip and hit me with one hand.

193
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.840
I couldn't find anything in the written rules that there were against that,

194
00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:41.640
but we were pulled on the straight away.

195
00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:44.190
So some of the areas where we taught we had to rest and,

196
00:10:44.191 --> 00:10:48.870
and maybe make Floyd use energy that he's on used to clinch.
We didn't get that.

197
00:10:48.871 --> 00:10:52.260
It was,
it was a media breaks and that's,
you know,
that's the sport of boxing,

198
00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.770
but that's just how it is.
So he had,
it would have to be all those,

199
00:10:55.771 --> 00:10:57.570
all those types of adjustments.

200
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:03.060
One of the more fascinating rumors was that there was going to be some sort of a

201
00:11:03.061 --> 00:11:07.860
striking match in the octagon.
Yes.
That is with MMA gloves.

202
00:11:07.861 --> 00:11:08.660
It's being talked about.

203
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:13.150
There was being talked about is being talkative that's being gone around as well

204
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.340
as up to Dane about that.
And he said it was harsh it.
Oh,
okay.
Uh,

205
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:20.160
well I don't deal with them.
You might heard about this.
I had heard of it.

206
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:22.350
Who's talking to you about it?
You know,

207
00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.440
speaking with Connor and speaking with [inaudible] to talk about like you can

208
00:11:25.441 --> 00:11:29.820
only trow leg kicks,
but uh,
you know,
dancing with it.
That would be the end.
Yeah.

209
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:34.860
I mean especially Lloyd did the site,
the site and Stan says,

210
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:35.491
you know what,

211
00:11:35.491 --> 00:11:38.750
it's like if you get a leg kick in in that way you must face straight on so you

212
00:11:38.751 --> 00:11:43.170
can check layer cakes.
If they allowed leg kicks and only leg kicks,

213
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.580
no head kicks.
Connor would fuck him up hundred percent quickly.

214
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.830
100% kager would be the first kick.

215
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.610
No one even understands it'd be the first leg kick.
Yeah.

216
00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:56.440
Now I will say right away that Connor,
absolutely it doesn't want to do that.

217
00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.560
He wants to fight UFC rules or boxing rules.

218
00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:05.050
Zero zero interest on the high reflects just that alone.

219
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.650
A hybrid fight.
Just leg kicks alone.
Yeah,

220
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.040
he would fuck Floyd Mayweather up.
Doesn't he want to fuck Floyd Mayweather up?

221
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:16.230
He does,
but,
but we didn't want it.
The two rule sets.
It does.

222
00:12:16.231 --> 00:12:20.800
It does take six leg kicks.
Just let him throw lake is just a few.

223
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.930
I mean it doesn't matter what fucking stands for.

224
00:12:22.931 --> 00:12:27.580
It stands in either inside leg kicks,
outside leg kicks.
Just one of those.

225
00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:30.020
It would be like we've,
we've allowed to,
you know,
Ireland is,

226
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:34.890
we have very good boxing history and I'm very good athletes and we get the odd

227
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.750
time and a good boxer will come now for spar and you know,
they,

228
00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:43.170
these guys can take shots all day long and wouldn't leg kick and Dave ruin,

229
00:12:43.171 --> 00:12:47.170
you know,
it's such a pain that they've never felt before.
You know,
like you said,

230
00:12:47.171 --> 00:12:49.660
it just,
it changes everything very,
very quickly.

231
00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:52.570
It would change Floyd's entire game.
He has no idea.

232
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:57.570
Do you remember what cool Vince Phillips fought Masato in Japan?
No.

233
00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.330
When Vince Phillips is at the top of his game,
when he was,
you know,

234
00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.670
a real elite boxer,

235
00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.470
it was just starting to slide and he went over and fought Masato and k one and

236
00:13:07.471 --> 00:13:10.420
Masato just for his legs up.

237
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:15.010
Sure as fuck those legs up.
It was horrifying to watch.

238
00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:20.260
The only one that I remember that went over there and actually,

239
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:25.040
oh,
Shannon cannon,
Channing the cannon.
Shannon Briggs fought,
uh,

240
00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:25.900
uh,

241
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:29.560
Tom Erickson and Tom Erickson cracked him with a couple of leg kicks and Shannon

242
00:13:29.561 --> 00:13:32.500
actually talked about it on the podcast.
He's like,
champ.

243
00:13:32.501 --> 00:13:35.320
He kept me with a couple of those leg kicks and I was ready to quit champ.

244
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:39.240
He was like,
it hurts so bad.
She goes,
but I'm pretended.
He goes up,

245
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:43.780
pretend today nothing.
He goes,
I'm in agony chip.
It's just a different pain.

246
00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:46.930
It's just a stomachs.
You can get whacked in the head all day long.
And then,

247
00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:50.800
you know,
most fighters won't even recognize that,
but the right buddy shot,

248
00:13:50.801 --> 00:13:51.041
you know,

249
00:13:51.041 --> 00:13:55.120
you had that liver or the right leg kick and there's just no grit in truth.

250
00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:57.910
It's stunning for people that have never been kicked before.

251
00:13:57.911 --> 00:14:01.720
It's stunning to watch WWE.
They're like,
what just happens all the time.

252
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.530
And if you watch like a k one match or a,
you know,

253
00:14:05.531 --> 00:14:08.680
a glory match or Moitai,

254
00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:12.430
it's just crazy how often they get kicked and they just learn how to absorb it.

255
00:14:12.431 --> 00:14:16.900
They learn how to check it and eat it and you know,
it just takes time.

256
00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:19.420
But that would,

257
00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:24.420
that would be if you could somehow or another talk Conor and Floyd into a boxing

258
00:14:25.001 --> 00:14:28.450
match with leg kicks.
Did Floyd actually say that?
That would be something.

259
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.730
It was just one of those,
while I'm talking to Connor eat,

260
00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:34.120
you'd regularly trow stuff at me.
Then I'm going to be like,

261
00:14:34.121 --> 00:14:35.800
what the hell are you talking?
I mean there's,

262
00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:38.770
I'm always having weird conversation and this was just one of them where it come

263
00:14:38.771 --> 00:14:40.540
up that there was a possibility it is,

264
00:14:40.541 --> 00:14:44.030
and they were talking about at hybrid rules and he shut it down straight away.

265
00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:46.910
You'll find them out.
You'll fight him off the seat and the,
they would be,

266
00:14:46.911 --> 00:14:51.640
of course,
ideal.
I think Floyd is a very intelligent guy.

267
00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.640
He's not good absolute intelligent guy.
He's not going to do that.

268
00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:57.910
I don't even think you would do the leg kick.
I don't think so wider.

269
00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:01.450
I think he flirts with a lot of this stuff.
I'll come over to your world,

270
00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:04.450
but he's,
no,
he's no fool.
He's super smart.
