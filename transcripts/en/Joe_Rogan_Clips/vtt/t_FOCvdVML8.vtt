WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.840
Two one and we're alive,

2
00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:11.740
Ladies and Gentlemen,
uh,
or gentlemen to the ladies and gentlemen listening.

3
00:00:11.741 --> 00:00:15.460
But Youtube,
unless you have some non-binary handle that you enjoy,

4
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.080
it's a new world.
Uh,
please,
please introduce yourself.

5
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.130
Sure.
So,
uh,
I'm Dr Mychart originally from Saint John's,
Newfoundland.
Uh,

6
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.440
now I'm residing in London,

7
00:00:26.441 --> 00:00:30.130
Ontario and I'm a family doctor and I've been practicing cannabis medicine for

8
00:00:30.131 --> 00:00:31.810
just over five years.
And

9
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.070
<v 2>My name is Alex Berenson.
I used to be in New York Times reporter.
Uh,</v>

10
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.410
then I became a spy novelist.
And most recently I wrote the book,

11
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.920
Tell Your children the truth about marijuana,
mental illness and violence,

12
00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:45.560
which came out last month and,
uh,

13
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.040
has not endeared me to the cannabis advocacy community.
I'd say

14
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.580
<v 1>have they attacked you mercilessly for this book?
Yes.</v>

15
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.250
And that's,
and that's okay.

16
00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.010
<v 2>Um,
uh,
I've also heard from a lot of parents,
uh,
you know,
some users,</v>

17
00:01:00.011 --> 00:01:04.690
but parents who've told me,
uh,
that the book really encapsulates their,

18
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.120
their family's problems in the last couple of years.

19
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.210
<v 1>Um,
I suspect my,</v>

20
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.610
my real thoughts here before we even get started,

21
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.090
we're going to find that the truth is somewhere in the middle here.
Um,

22
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.810
I don't think marijuana is a hundred percent safe,

23
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.110
honestly for everybody.
I really don't,

24
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.030
I know too many people that have had experiences where they took too much,

25
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.240
particularly edibles and,
uh,
I don't,

26
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.240
I want to say I know anybody who had psychotic breaks,

27
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.650
but I know some people that freaked out for weeks,
you know,
in fact,
a,

28
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.730
we just had a,
a,
a comedian here from Brazil.
Um,

29
00:01:42.731 --> 00:01:43.750
a couple days ago,

30
00:01:43.751 --> 00:01:47.530
Rafi Barstow's who said he took a couple of hits of a vape pen,

31
00:01:47.531 --> 00:01:52.180
he was high for 14 days,
went to a psychiatrist and,
and he's a big guy.

32
00:01:52.181 --> 00:01:55.540
He's like six foot five,
six,
six,
you know,
and you know,

33
00:01:55.541 --> 00:01:58.960
they told him to keep taking it cause you know,
he's like,
you're so big,

34
00:01:58.961 --> 00:02:01.420
just keep smoking.
And so he,
he doesn't smoke.

35
00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:04.540
So he just kept hitting this vape pen.
He said I was high for fucking two weeks.

36
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.000
You need to do it properly,
right.

37
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.460
Need to be held to the same standard as any other medicines.

38
00:02:10.461 --> 00:02:15.460
So you need to identify that there's risks and there's benefits to it and some

39
00:02:15.461 --> 00:02:19.720
people are definitely going to be more susceptible to those risks.

40
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.710
And we need to kind of tease out those people and make sure that those people,

41
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.180
you know,
don't put themselves at risk.
Yeah,
I think so as well.

42
00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:30.700
And this is one of the reasons why I want to state this because I'm a well known

43
00:02:30.701 --> 00:02:34.120
marijuana advocate,
but I,
I do believe,

44
00:02:34.121 --> 00:02:37.030
I believe absolutely there are great benefits to it.

45
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.500
I think there's great benefits in terms of uh,
relieving pressure,

46
00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:44.320
ocular pressure for people that have glaucoma,

47
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.570
people with aids who are on medication,

48
00:02:46.571 --> 00:02:50.140
people with cancer that are going through chemotherapy find great benefit in

49
00:02:50.141 --> 00:02:53.860
terms of helping them.
And then there's also some people with autism.

50
00:02:53.861 --> 00:02:57.550
I know people that their children have autism and they give them small amounts

51
00:02:57.551 --> 00:02:59.020
of edible marijuana and stops.

52
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.360
<v 2>It's incredibly beneficial in the form of CBD for a lot of different ailments.</v>

53
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.550
But I think with all things,

54
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:11.140
and this is a stance that I've kind of like really come to accept over the last

55
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.390
few years with all things that affect the mind,

56
00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:17.860
they affect everyone slightly differently.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
Alex,

57
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:21.120
he wanted to say something.
They're not full of force.
I suspect,
you know,

58
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.740
there were people who said,
don't go on with Joe.
He's just going to,
you know,

59
00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:26.950
he's going to try to eat you alive and,
and especially there'll be,

60
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:30.460
it'll be two on one.
I told them the truth.
First of all,
I,

61
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.080
I'll go on with anybody and I am glad you had me on or you're having me on

62
00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:39.550
because,
uh,
you know,
Bill Maher,
he won't have me on.

63
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.530
He's afraid to talk to me about this.
Why,
what did he say?
Well,
he,
you know,

64
00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:47.470
he told the,
or his people told the Simon and Schuster PR people,

65
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.270
we just didn't want to have him on.

66
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.050
And a and NPR had a national NPR show,

67
00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:56.710
had an interview scheduled with me,
an hour long segment and they canceled it.

68
00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:59.740
They said,
they said,
we don't believe in the conclusions of the book.
Okay.

69
00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:03.460
You don't believe in the conclusions in the book,
have me on ask me anything.

70
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.870
And that's why I'm so happy that you're not afraid to have me on that.

71
00:04:07.871 --> 00:04:11.650
We can have a conversation that we can have a conversation come at me with any

72
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:15.070
question you want about the science.
Um,
I mean,
I'll say right off the top,

73
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.050
I don't think marijuana is medicine.
Uh,
it has a few,
uh,

74
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.430
medical uses,
uh,
that had been,
you know,

75
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:24.580
CBD has been shown to reduce seizures and kids.
That's great.

76
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.030
A THC has been,
uh,

77
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.750
shown to reduce the nausea associated with chemotherapy.
That's nice.
Uh,

78
00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:32.890
but for the most part,

79
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.910
people use THC and cannabis has recreational and toxicants.

80
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.520
They used them to get high the same way they use alcohol the same way they use

81
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:43.120
other drugs.
And the sooner we,
we accept that reality,

82
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.650
the better off we'll all be.

83
00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:49.330
That this is a drug and it has risks and benefits and the risks and benefits are

84
00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:51.370
different than alcohol.
They're different than other drugs.

85
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.700
But I don't think if you look sort of on a population level basis,

86
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:57.970
they're less than alcohol.
I don't think you can even say that.
I don't,

87
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.760
I really strongly disagree with that.
And I mean,

88
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.640
you just have to look at the death rate,
right?
Uh,
you know,

89
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.380
more people die from alcohol and you know,
almost all drugs combined.

90
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.270
But when we're looking at cannabis,

91
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.710
there's zero deaths attributed to the use of cannabis itself.
Sure.

92
00:05:14.711 --> 00:05:15.730
You could say,
you know,

93
00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:19.510
someone could use cannabis and jump off a cliff or something like that,

94
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.530
but we're talking about the lethal dose.
You cannot die from cannabis.

95
00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:27.160
And just based upon that alone,
it makes it much,

96
00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:31.930
much safer than alcohol.
So the district,
could you say that that is the case?

97
00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:34.340
So,
okay,
so that's a really good question.
Uh,

98
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.860
the normal number that's used for us deaths from alcohol,
it's about 90,000 now.

99
00:05:38.861 --> 00:05:43.660
About 30 to 40,000 of those deaths are desk from the physical effects of
alcohol.

100
00:05:43.661 --> 00:05:47.500
Right?
Essentially liver damage,
either chronic liver damage,
you get cirrhosis,

101
00:05:47.501 --> 00:05:51.670
you die.
In some cases you can drink so much that you kill yourself in a night.

102
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.370
Uh,
so that's about 30 to 40,000 deaths.

103
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.310
The other deaths are generally associated alcohol,
meaning

104
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.330
<v 1>somebody drank exactly violence,
suicide,</v>

105
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.820
car accidents and the,

106
00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:09.650
all those numbers are basically based on studies from the 90s and before where

107
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.131
you know,

108
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:13.250
people looked at traffic accidents and there were certain number of those

109
00:06:13.251 --> 00:06:17.240
accidents where people had a blood alcohol content of higher than 0.1.
They said,

110
00:06:17.241 --> 00:06:20.630
okay,
that's an alcohol associated death.
That's a fine way to count.

111
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:24.740
As far as I'm concerned,
nobody has ever done that count for cannabis.

112
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.750
And I can tell you based on the,

113
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.780
on the tox screens that I've seen from Colorado where people,
uh,

114
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.290
had cannabis in their blood and committed suicide,

115
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.430
people had cannabis in there are I should say THC and their blood and uh,

116
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.810
and got into a fatal confrontations with police officers.
If,
if,
if,

117
00:06:41.811 --> 00:06:45.590
and when we do this number for cannabis,
which we need to do as soon as possible,

118
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.690
the number's going to be a lot higher than zero.

119
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.000
I suspect it will be in the 10 to 20,000 range.

120
00:06:50.001 --> 00:06:53.300
We won't know till we actually do it.
Okay,
well let's,
let's eliminate,

121
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.100
let's go even over the alcohol.

122
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.660
Let's eliminate all things like violence and what's eliminate suicide.

123
00:06:59.661 --> 00:07:02.060
And let's assume those people would have committed violence and committed

124
00:07:02.061 --> 00:07:02.960
suicide.
Without it.

125
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.400
You're still looking at a giant number of people who drink themselves to death.

126
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.970
Thousands and thousands and thousands of people every year versus zero with

127
00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:12.590
marijuana.
And you're aware,

128
00:07:12.591 --> 00:07:15.580
I'm sure that correlation does not equal causation and that,

129
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.610
especially in a place like Colorado where you're dealing with cannabis,

130
00:07:19.611 --> 00:07:22.460
something that stays in the system for many,
many weeks.

131
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:27.170
If you're testing people and they test positive for marijuana and they wind up

132
00:07:27.171 --> 00:07:30.290
committing suicide or they wind up committing violence,

133
00:07:30.291 --> 00:07:34.040
they don't even necessarily have to have been under the influence of it.
Well,

134
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.710
as you know,
there's w when you test the blood,

135
00:07:36.711 --> 00:07:40.690
you can test the both the active metabolite and the inactive metabolite of THC.

136
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.880
So,
so the test,
when you do a blood test on somebody who's,
you know,

137
00:07:43.881 --> 00:07:47.170
has committed suicide,
it's sophisticated enough to tease that out.
Um,

138
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.830
so there's a lot of people who have the active metabolite in their blood.
Um,

139
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.050
I agree.
Alcoholics,
they physically toxic substance.

140
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:58.060
Cannabis is a neurotoxin for a lot of people.
But in addition to,
you know,

141
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:02.750
the death,
there's also just the morbidity that's associated with alcohol.
I mean,

142
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:06.800
it ruins people's lives.
That ruins marriages.
Uh,
it leads to weight gain.

143
00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:08.840
It leads to a lot of metabolic disturbances.

144
00:08:08.841 --> 00:08:11.270
Thank you can say that for some people with marijuana too,

145
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.790
I think you could say some people,
especially weight gain,

146
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.850
that some people smoke a lot of pot and they get lazy and they started eating

147
00:08:16.851 --> 00:08:21.680
Cheetos all day.
And,
and you could also say that with some people,
you know,

148
00:08:21.681 --> 00:08:25.250
the wakened bakers that,
you know,
seem to be wasting their lives away.

149
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:29.280
And that's like the stereotypical negative con,
you know,

150
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.790
when you were talking about a negative description of a marijuana user,

151
00:08:31.791 --> 00:08:33.920
it's the waking Baker.
At first it was high all the time.

152
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:37.040
You could absolutely said that could really ruin relationships.

153
00:08:37.041 --> 00:08:41.300
You could absolutely say that it would ruin your job.
You could.
But again too,

154
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:41.631
you know,

155
00:08:41.631 --> 00:08:46.460
we're using the term marijuana and really we should be using THC or high THC

156
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:48.620
when we're saying that because you know,

157
00:08:48.621 --> 00:08:52.790
people who use a high CBD every day as we know are most people listen,

158
00:08:52.791 --> 00:08:56.070
this is pure CBD,
is non psychoactive,
not get you high,

159
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.670
<v 3>super beneficial.
That can be extremely beneficial for you know,</v>

160
00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.340
a variety of different disorders that people have.
So,
you know,

161
00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:05.810
we really need to be careful about using canvas versus using,
you know,

162
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.540
THC because it's really the THC that can do that.
And to your point,
you know,

163
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:13.200
but you know,
you say like THC can cause the munchies and of course that's,

164
00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:17.990
you know,
not good for someone who doesn't want to gain weight and just,
you know,

165
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.220
so people know the,

166
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:23.280
the way that it does do that is when she see attached to the CB one receptor,

167
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:28.110
you had an increase in a hormone called Ghrelin and Ghrelin can actually induce

168
00:09:28.111 --> 00:09:31.650
hunger.
And that's why people get get the munchies.
But you know,

169
00:09:31.651 --> 00:09:36.600
that is not necessarily a bad thing if you're someone who has cancer or if you

170
00:09:36.601 --> 00:09:40.470
or someone you know,
who,
who's wasting away from,
from,
from a terrible illness,

171
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:44.150
you know,
sometimes,
you know,
having,
uh,
having the munchies is,

172
00:09:44.151 --> 00:09:47.190
is definitely a good thing.
Um,
and I know,
you know,

173
00:09:47.191 --> 00:09:49.560
a lot of people have said to me,
you know,

174
00:09:49.561 --> 00:09:53.460
it's not available so you should probably not talk about as much,

175
00:09:53.461 --> 00:09:57.810
but there is another cannabinoid called THCV.
So you know,
there's,

176
00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:01.260
there's over a hundred cannabinoids in cannabis cheat seeing CD are only two of

177
00:10:01.261 --> 00:10:03.330
them.
You know,
those are the main ones that people know about.

178
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.050
So THCV has been shown to actually reduce appetite.

179
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:11.190
So if we can get that out there in the market,
you know,
like we have with,

180
00:10:11.191 --> 00:10:15.750
with CBD,
then we can almost feel eliminate or potentially,
you know,

181
00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.770
substantially reduced the problem that people have with,
with,
uh,

182
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:23.430
with THC by using it,
uh,
with THCV darker.
And I have a question for you.

183
00:10:23.431 --> 00:10:25.650
When people come into your practice,
did they,

184
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.120
do they want high CBD products or did they want to get intoxicated?
And No,

185
00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:32.850
absolutely.
Absolutely.
Sure.
Of course.
Yeah.

186
00:10:32.851 --> 00:10:36.360
So it's like if they don't need to go to him to get intoxicated.
So people,

187
00:10:36.361 --> 00:10:39.780
so you're seeing a population that is genuinely interested in the health

188
00:10:39.781 --> 00:10:43.950
benefits?
Absolutely,
because I mean if enemies,
I'm glad that that,
uh,

189
00:10:43.951 --> 00:10:47.160
that's legalized in Canada because it does make my job a little bit easier

190
00:10:47.161 --> 00:10:50.160
because be like basically everyone who is coming to me now,

191
00:10:50.161 --> 00:10:53.130
I know that they want to use it medically because if they want to use it

192
00:10:53.131 --> 00:10:56.040
recreationally,
I mean they just go to the store,
right.

193
00:10:56.041 --> 00:10:58.000
Cause it's kind of a pain to,
you know,

194
00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:01.170
get in to see me come in and have the discussion,
all that type of stuff.

195
00:11:01.171 --> 00:11:03.600
So you know,
the people who see me now,
um,
you know,

196
00:11:03.601 --> 00:11:06.390
they're all using it medically.
Um,
and then,
you know,

197
00:11:06.391 --> 00:11:09.930
to answer your question though,
Alex,
almost all my patients,

198
00:11:09.931 --> 00:11:12.420
as soon as they come in,
they say I don't want to get high.

199
00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:16.230
I don't want to get high.
Like that's almost what everyone says.
So,
you know,

200
00:11:16.231 --> 00:11:19.410
I think the word is out there that uh,
you know,

201
00:11:19.411 --> 00:11:22.440
CBD is non psychoactive and it doesn't get you high.

202
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.760
And I think that a lot of people are really interested in that compound and you

203
00:11:26.761 --> 00:11:27.730
know,
if,
if,

204
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:31.440
if the people didn't have the success that they've had over the past few years,

205
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.670
you know,
it wouldn't be as popular as it is.
So,
you know,
I think that,
um,

206
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.040
you know,
we do need to look at the scientific evidence,

207
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:41.540
but we do need to listen to others in the anecdotal evidence is,
you know,

208
00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:45.030
something that,
that,
that we should consider because it is so strong.
Alex,

209
00:11:45.031 --> 00:11:45.841
let me ask you this,

210
00:11:45.841 --> 00:11:49.860
why don't you consider it medicine when it has proven medical benefits?

211
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:54.250
It obviously can be medicine for these narrow things that FDA has approved

212
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:58.620
<v 2>it for.
But as you know,
I'm sure when people talk about it as Madison,</v>

213
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.060
when the,
the,
the,
the,

214
00:12:01.061 --> 00:12:04.690
the ballot initiatives that have gotten it approved as a medicine have really

215
00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:09.170
essentially deceive voters about the process.
Right?
So you go to a,

216
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:13.150
you go to a pot doctor,
you get an authorization.

217
00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:17.230
That authorization essentially enables you to buy as much cannabis as you want

218
00:12:17.231 --> 00:12:20.410
for the next year.
Most of the time,
in reality,

219
00:12:20.411 --> 00:12:23.410
these doctors are not giving you a real medical examination.

220
00:12:23.411 --> 00:12:25.600
They're saying to you,
Hey,
do you have pain?
Do you have anxiety?

221
00:12:25.601 --> 00:12:26.660
Here's your authorization.

222
00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:31.580
<v 1>I don't think you should speak for every single doctor loan or we don't do that.</v>

223
00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.540
Uh,
at my clinic.
And I know that,
you know,
a lot of the clinics in Canada anyway,

224
00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.960
uh,
we definitely do not do that.
And,
uh,
you know,

225
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:42.800
we provide a lot of education at my clinic and there's other clinics in Canada.

226
00:12:42.801 --> 00:12:43.460
The also

227
00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:47.670
<v 2>sure education and,
and I,
and I imagine there's a spectrum,
but in the US,</v>

228
00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:50.430
this was a [inaudible] and I spoke to advocates from our book.

229
00:12:50.431 --> 00:12:51.870
I spoke to Rob Kampia,
who,
you know,

230
00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:56.100
who ran the marijuana policy project for a long time,
um,
for the book.
And He,

231
00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.650
and he acknowledged,
you know,

232
00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:01.570
the advocates knew that this was a backdoor route to legalization in the yoga.

233
00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:05.670
I used to joke around about it.
Yeah.
My doctor said,
uh,
why do you do pot?
I said,

234
00:13:05.671 --> 00:13:08.190
I'd get headaches.
He said,
when do you get headaches?
I said,

235
00:13:08.191 --> 00:13:12.000
whenever I think about the fact that pot's illegal when wrote me a prescription.

236
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:15.930
I mean,
let's be honest about it.
I'm not,
look,
I say in the book at the end,

237
00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.510
I don't think this should be,
this substance should be legal.

238
00:13:18.511 --> 00:13:20.850
I have favorite decriminalization.
We're sort of jumping ahead here,

239
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:25.020
but if it's gonna be legal,
I'd rather have it be legal for recreational use.

240
00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:29.850
I'd rather that we don't pretend that THC high cannabis is a medicine and I'd

241
00:13:29.851 --> 00:13:30.780
rather separate out.

242
00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:35.860
<v 1>Yeah,
but why are you saying don't pretend?</v>

243
00:13:35.861 --> 00:13:39.130
Because there's many medicines that have horrific side effects.

244
00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:41.080
The medicine,

245
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:46.200
THC in regards to children's autism is pretty significant and well documented.

246
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.370
The epilepsy,
autism,

247
00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.840
those are two huge things that happen with children that they've been shown to

248
00:13:52.841 --> 00:13:55.990
severely mitigate with with edible marijuana.

249
00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.460
<v 2>So I have to push back on you a little bit.</v>

250
00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:02.260
CBD has been shown to reduce seizures in children with epilepsy.
It's,
it's okay.

251
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.120
It's approved for me.

252
00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.150
<v 1>Be Anecdotal,</v>

253
00:14:04.151 --> 00:14:09.151
but I have a good friend who has a child who he uses it on it and he showed you

254
00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:12.070
mean it's been a game change,
right?
Yeah.

255
00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.960
I mean I let just let me interrupt for sex.

256
00:14:13.961 --> 00:14:17.820
Like I had a patient four or five years ago and uh,

257
00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:22.150
she was 20 years old.
She couldn't drive a car because she had seizures.
Right.

258
00:14:22.151 --> 00:14:25.810
So you can imagine being 20 years old,
not being able to drive a car,

259
00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:30.220
all your friends are driving around.
So she uses a little bit of CBD,

260
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.940
not even every day.
She's never had a seizure since.

261
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:37.540
And now she's able to drive her car.
But this is,
we're talking about CBD,

262
00:14:37.541 --> 00:14:39.040
he's talking about THC.

263
00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:43.070
<v 2>So you're talking about,
you're talking about a case.
Okay.
And,</v>

264
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.140
and I'm not saying that your friend's situation didn't happen.

265
00:14:46.141 --> 00:14:47.010
I'm not saying it's not real.

266
00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:52.040
What I'm saying is that the reason we have clinical trials is because science,

267
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.670
the way you know whether a medicine works or not,

268
00:14:55.671 --> 00:14:58.370
whether a chemical compound works,
whatever that company is,

269
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.940
the best way to know is you give it to two groups of you give,

270
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:05.540
you give the real medicine to one group of people and you give a placebo to the

271
00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:09.830
other group and you see the changes in those two groups over time and you find

272
00:15:09.831 --> 00:15:10.641
out whether you're not,

273
00:15:10.641 --> 00:15:14.810
your theory about whether this works on a population level basis is real or not.

274
00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.990
That's how that is at the core of medical science.

275
00:15:17.991 --> 00:15:21.260
And we've basically thrown that rule out for THC.

276
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:23.750
Well that's not entirely correct.

277
00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.630
You do know that there's were studies that were run during the Nixon

278
00:15:26.631 --> 00:15:29.690
administration that showed the efficacy of marijuana and the safety of it,

279
00:15:29.691 --> 00:15:31.490
and those were all squashed.
And you also,

280
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.580
I'm sure you know like when we're talking about marijuana,

281
00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:36.440
you talking about something that's federally illegal,

282
00:15:36.441 --> 00:15:40.680
it's not something that's ego that's easy to run these FDA studies on.
Yes,

283
00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.280
and I do.
And I said at the end of the book,
I think we should drop that.

284
00:15:43.281 --> 00:15:47.510
I think anybody who's got a legitimate interest in researching either THC or

285
00:15:47.511 --> 00:15:50.690
cannabis or any of the compounds for a,
for a medical condition,

286
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:55.700
let them run phase one,
phase two,
phase three,
trust.
Let's see if this,
if this,

287
00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.300
if this plant is good for these things,
I think that's a great idea.
But still,

288
00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:03.020
why are you saying that you don't think it is medicine when all these people

289
00:16:03.021 --> 00:16:07.340
find benefit in it?
So,
so do you think they're getting it from just the CBD,

290
00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:11.930
the minimal amount of CBD and marijuana?
No,
I think that,
again,
there,

291
00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:17.080
there's been a lot of research done on THC and cannabis to see whether or not

292
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.090
those,
whether THC is a compound in weather,
smoke,

293
00:16:20.091 --> 00:16:22.880
cannabis can treat these conditions.
And for the most part,

294
00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:26.240
the studies have been negative.
The,
again,
there's negative in what way?

295
00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:29.270
Meaning they haven't shown any actual,
uh,
like,

296
00:16:29.271 --> 00:16:33.110
can you stay cite these studies there?
I mentioned that in my book.

297
00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.620
Okay,
well what,
what were the conclusions of these studies?

298
00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:39.260
When you're saying that they're not positive,
that they,
again,

299
00:16:39.261 --> 00:16:42.710
that they didn't work,
that the drug didn't work on what?

300
00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:47.690
On cancer,
on Alzheimer's disease,
on irritable bowel syndrome,
on.

301
00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.650
<v 3>So Alex to mean,
you know,</v>

302
00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.480
you're throwing a few different things out there and you know,

303
00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:55.480
I appreciate the fact that we can't be going around.
You're saying things like,

304
00:16:55.481 --> 00:17:00.160
you know,
cannabis cures cancer,
right?
But you know,
I,
uh,
you know,

305
00:17:00.161 --> 00:17:03.970
and I've done videos on this even like recently stating that,

306
00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.830
but if you look at the research,

307
00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:09.300
I mean specifically if you look at specific cancers,
uh,

308
00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:13.810
there are studies that have shown that THC and CBD can help.
Like it's safe.

309
00:17:13.811 --> 00:17:17.410
We're talking about breast cancer.
And I did a video on this recently.
You know,

310
00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.640
if you are her two positive and use cheats seeing CBD,

311
00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:26.350
it came in fact,
uh,
reduce tumor size and it can reduce tumor growth.

312
00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.630
Now if you have,
what does,
I'm sorry,
can I interrupt you?
What does that mean?

313
00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.640
What does this subset of of breast cancer,
right?
So,
um,
there's,

314
00:17:33.641 --> 00:17:36.850
there's different types of breast cancer and that's just one subset of,

315
00:17:36.851 --> 00:17:37.690
of breast cancer.

316
00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:42.100
So there are other breast cancers which do not express cannabinoid receptors.

317
00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:45.070
And you know,
I've seen a one study,
at least,
again,

318
00:17:45.071 --> 00:17:48.400
it's only one study that show that when they gave cheat seat and that animal

319
00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:52.740
model and actually cause a proliferation of,
of tumors,
so it worse than them.
So,

320
00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.350
you know,
I do agree with you Alex,
and the fact that,
you know,

321
00:17:55.351 --> 00:17:58.770
we have to be careful about using terms like that,

322
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.740
but that just doesn't mean that we can't say that cannabis has no good for

323
00:18:01.741 --> 00:18:03.000
cancer at all.
And I mean,

324
00:18:03.001 --> 00:18:06.650
even in the National Academies of Science and Engineering Report,
you know,

325
00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:07.710
they said that cancer was,

326
00:18:07.711 --> 00:18:12.330
was great for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting.
Right.
So,
you know,

327
00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:16.410
it's,
it's definitely a really good,
um,
you know,
medicine for,
you know,

328
00:18:16.411 --> 00:18:20.430
a lot of different things.
And when we're talking about cheat,
see,
you know,
I,
uh,

329
00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.640
I said earlier,
of course,
and we need to be careful about,
about THC,

330
00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.790
but it definitely is still a medicine.
And you know,

331
00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:29.180
to your point with regards to,
um,
you know,

332
00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:32.580
not being a medicine say for something like Ptsd,
you know,

333
00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:37.110
I come from it from a clinician's point of view,
so I'm not a researcher,

334
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:40.440
so I need to make sure that my patients are getting better.

335
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.470
It's very frustrating for me just to say to someone,
oh,

336
00:18:43.471 --> 00:18:46.620
there's nothing I can do for you.
There's nothing I can do for it,
you know,
so,

337
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:47.940
and I understand that,
you know,

338
00:18:47.941 --> 00:18:52.560
doing something sometimes a is not going to be beneficial just because you're

339
00:18:52.561 --> 00:18:56.190
doing something,
you have to do something that actually works.
But,
you know,

340
00:18:56.191 --> 00:19:00.870
we do have epidemiological studies and we have,
uh,
other studies have shown that,

341
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:04.620
um,
you know,
when patients are given a cannabis,

342
00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:09.180
it can reduce their symptoms of PTSD.
There's also another study,
you know,

343
00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:11.460
I don't use this drug too often,
call it called Nabilone.

344
00:19:11.461 --> 00:19:13.620
So nabilone is just pure THC.

345
00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:18.870
Nabilone was shown to reduce nightmares and people who have PTSD.
So,

346
00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:20.730
you know,
it's just saying,
just so,

347
00:19:20.731 --> 00:19:24.540
just because THC is psychoactive doesn't mean that it's not a medicine.

348
00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:29.010
And just to keep on the topic of,
of PTSD.
Um,
in addition to that,

349
00:19:29.011 --> 00:19:33.510
we've identified mechanisms of action.
Um,
I know there's one study,

350
00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:35.980
I think Matt Hill was on the,
uhW,

351
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.630
was one of the authors of that study and he noticed that and people who have

352
00:19:39.631 --> 00:19:44.010
PTSD,
there's an over 50% decrease in,
uh,

353
00:19:44.011 --> 00:19:47.790
in levels of [inaudible].
So a nature on the naturally occurring,

354
00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.050
which is,
which is a naturally occurring in the canal when it correct.
Um,

355
00:19:52.051 --> 00:19:54.840
so you can get that through,
through exercise,

356
00:19:54.841 --> 00:19:57.870
which is one excellent way to do it.
And you know,
and that's part of the,
uh,

357
00:19:57.871 --> 00:20:00.150
the high that,
that you get after you exercise.

358
00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:04.550
But the other way that you can get it is by using cannabis.
So when,
when she,

359
00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.360
she attaches to those CB one receptors,

360
00:20:06.361 --> 00:20:09.120
you can get a release of an anti mind and,
uh,

361
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:14.400
Kinda dial can actually increase in antibiotic by another mechanism of action as

362
00:20:14.521 --> 00:20:19.140
well.
So,
you know,
there's different ways where we can,
you know,
raise a level of,

363
00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:23.040
of deficiency.
So,
you know,
to me as a clinician,
you know,

364
00:20:23.041 --> 00:20:26.340
if I have someone who is not doing very well,
you know,

365
00:20:26.341 --> 00:20:28.350
they've been on a bunch of different medications,

366
00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:32.790
I've identified that they have PTSD,
we have mechanisms of action,

367
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.310
we have studies.
And then again too,
you know,

368
00:20:35.311 --> 00:20:38.750
don't discount my clinical experience.
Right.
I've been,
uh,

369
00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:43.080
working for over five years,
you know,
just with,
uh,
just with cannabis.
I mean,

370
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:46.260
I do other medicines,
I use prescribed other medicines as well,

371
00:20:46.261 --> 00:20:49.720
but I've been doing medicine for over five years and you know,

372
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:53.560
there's a lot that,
that I've learned,
right?
So as much as I've learned,
you know,

373
00:20:53.561 --> 00:20:55.770
through reading studies,
um,
and,

374
00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.240
and through going to conferences and things like that,
you know,

375
00:20:58.241 --> 00:21:03.241
for sure that the best resource as a clinician is to learn from your patients

376
00:21:04.211 --> 00:21:07.300
and to hear what your patients tell me.
And you know,
the,

377
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:11.530
the things that my patients tell me is that THC is really effective for the

378
00:21:11.531 --> 00:21:15.010
sleep at night.
And a lot of my patients,
especially my veteran patients,

379
00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:19.210
had done really,
really well with that.
And just,
just one further point too,

380
00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:22.660
you know,
there was a,
I know it was,
it was in 2015 I believe it was.

381
00:21:22.661 --> 00:21:25.720
There was a Meta analysis done.
I can pull it up if we need to,

382
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:27.820
that indicated that,
um,
you know,

383
00:21:27.821 --> 00:21:32.500
a lot of medicines that are being used now for PTSD or just simply ineffective.

384
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:36.160
And the other thing too is that there's never been a medicine made specifically

385
00:21:36.161 --> 00:21:37.750
for PTSD.

386
00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:41.200
So all the medicines that people are using or for anxiety or there for

387
00:21:41.201 --> 00:21:45.100
depression or the for insomnia there,
Arthur for something else,
you know,

388
00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:50.020
but when we look at a study that says people with PTSD have a lower level of

389
00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:54.340
[inaudible],
and then if you can increase that a level of Nando mind,
you know,

390
00:21:54.341 --> 00:21:57.640
that's a good way to treat someone.
It doesn't matter whether it's a vitamin,

391
00:21:57.641 --> 00:22:01.330
whether it's a hormone,
if belongs as you are correcting a deficiency,

392
00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:04.030
you're generally going to get excellent clinical results.
