1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.930
The joe rogan experience.
It's instant trauma.
I mean,

2
00:00:04.931 --> 00:00:09.340
I have mental illness.
I have a cousin who is paranoid schizophrenia.

3
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.190
All right.
And my dad would tell me,
but he's my,

4
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.540
I don't know how the fucking second remove shit works is my father's first

5
00:00:16.541 --> 00:00:19.330
cousin.
Okay.
Still alive.
Dude.

6
00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:23.410
Smoked a carton of cigarettes in three days.
Whoa.
I mean,

7
00:00:23.411 --> 00:00:26.290
we have no idea how he's ever a throat fucking left.

8
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.820
But he was really fucking,
he was a black belt in karate.

9
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.330
He was great at Lacrosse.
He had Hopkins,
Syracuse,

10
00:00:34.331 --> 00:00:38.740
big schools looking at him and then he'll tell you he started doing drugs and he

11
00:00:38.741 --> 00:00:42.100
went fucking the Syd Barrett route and he just went off the fucking deep end.

12
00:00:42.101 --> 00:00:47.080
And he's permanent disability,
diagnosed paranoid schizophrenia.

13
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.400
And um,
you know,
he's,
we all love him but,

14
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.230
and he's fucking hilarious.

15
00:00:53.231 --> 00:00:55.780
Like he'll play with it because sometimes he's on his meds and you can tell

16
00:00:55.781 --> 00:00:58.380
you're like,
oh,
you're dialing in right now.
Start telling family secrets.

17
00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.320
I'm like,
don't listen to him.

18
00:00:59.321 --> 00:01:01.180
Like not an option right now is when you listen to them.

19
00:01:01.181 --> 00:01:02.320
I can see it in their eyes.

20
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.320
The other times when he's off looking over here like that,
you don't know.

21
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.680
But we would go like he had an apartment and I would go visit them from time to

22
00:01:11.681 --> 00:01:16.681
time and he had poetry and sayings and stuff written all over the wall.

23
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.060
And I'm like,
what is this?
And he's like,

24
00:01:19.061 --> 00:01:23.830
well at night when I'm home alone to doctors come in through my window,

25
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.580
they drop liquid acid in my ears and they knock me out and then they start

26
00:01:27.581 --> 00:01:30.970
taking samples of my body and after they leave,

27
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.180
the love of my life comes and I can't communicate with her.

28
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.860
So this is how I communicate with are these are there for when she comes in to

29
00:01:38.861 --> 00:01:41.650
speak for me and I'm like,
Whoa,
whoa.

30
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.180
So his windows are nailed shut to keep the doctors out and like how's that work?

31
00:01:46.181 --> 00:01:47.014
And he's like,
it's not.

32
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.960
So one day I'm over there and he's watching TV with the volume all the way down

33
00:01:56.711 --> 00:02:00.340
and the radio up and that's how he's watching this program.

34
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.150
And I'm telling you,
it started to fucking make sense.
I was like,

35
00:02:04.151 --> 00:02:06.710
I gotta get the fuck out.
I gotta get Outta here.
Gary,
sorry,

36
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.940
I'm out of here on this.
There's a disease that,

37
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.100
<v 1>um,
I'm trying to remember the name of it,
but it,</v>

38
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.130
it basically is when people are around schizophrenia x for too long,

39
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.730
they develop schizophrenia themselves.
Really?
Yeah.

40
00:02:22.731 --> 00:02:26.990
There's some people who are sympathetic to it,
to the point where,
God,

41
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.660
I want to say,
I want to say it's called Allah phrenia.
There's,

42
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.680
there's a some sort of a disease that occasionally infects people or,

43
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.850
or gets people that visit people in the hospital that are schizophrenia.

44
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.990
So someone will come,

45
00:02:41.991 --> 00:02:46.991
like family member will come visit you and they will get diagnosed and they will

46
00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:52.100
get admitted themselves and know hat they'll actually get it.
They get it.

47
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.940
I don't know like to what stage,
but apparently it is an,

48
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.860
it's a potential issue for some people because like,
look,

49
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.850
have you ever been hypnotized?
No.

50
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.030
I thought it was horse shit to my friend Vinny shoreman,

51
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.510
who is a sports hypnotist who works for a lot of fighters.
He hypnotized me.

52
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:12.130
I'm like,
Whoa,
this is real.

53
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.880
It just puts you in a very bizarre stay feel that state.
Yes,
you're there,

54
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:18.760
you're awake,
you're conscious,
but you're in a strange state.

55
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.070
It's almost feel something.
Yeah.
I like,
you're like,

56
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.840
like you're in a tube of consciousness or something,
like you're in a womb.

57
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.520
It's very,
very interesting.
But I'm listening to him and he's a friend.

58
00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:33.670
I trust him.
He's a great guy.
So it wasn't weird about it.
So I was like,
Oh yeah,

59
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:36.460
you could do it.
God,
let's see.
Let's see what happens.
I was Kinda skeptical.

60
00:03:36.461 --> 00:03:38.950
I was like,
this is horseshit.
But I've been to,

61
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:42.130
have your been to one of those hypnotist comedy shows?
No.

62
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.960
My friend Frank Santos,
he was a guy who,
uh,
he's passed away,

63
00:03:46.961 --> 00:03:51.961
but he was a big time comedy hypnotist guy in Boston and in Rhode Island and he

64
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:55.450
had a show and he,
I saw his show man.

65
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.470
He used to do like one night a week it stitches and one night a week at Nick's

66
00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:04.060
comedy stop.
And Dude,
we would go down there on days off just to watch.

67
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.080
It was crazy.

68
00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:07.690
He would take people out of the audience like who wants to be able to touch and

69
00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:09.370
he had a weird way of talking and who want to be hitting ties.

70
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:10.720
You want to be hypnotized.
Fun of con.

71
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.960
It was like a around jolly fellow real friendly glasses,
you know,

72
00:04:14.961 --> 00:04:16.930
like totally unassuming.
You didn't think you'd,

73
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.250
and then he would bring these people on stage and he would just be able to take

74
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.680
sweetie,
you're going to go under,
you're gonna,
you're gonna fall asleep.

75
00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:26.350
You're gonna fall asleep.
When I snap my fingers,
you're going to thank you.

76
00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:28.990
Our Sally fields at right next to you is Burt Reynolds

77
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.660
and he would see these people and they really,
they were like smokey.

78
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.100
We got to get away from the police.

79
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.080
Like they really believed he had this one guy.
He told her they would,

80
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.880
they would actually speak like that person.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

81
00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:46.120
They didn't know what they were out of the mind.
This one guy,
he told the guy,

82
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.900
this was the 80s he told the guy that the guy was having sex with Madonna.

83
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.020
He's like underneath you as Madonna and you're squeezing her booties.

84
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.680
You're booby her boobies and she's naked and you're about to have sex with her.

85
00:04:56.681 --> 00:04:58.480
You're going to have sex,
you're having sex with her right now.

86
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.860
And the guy had an orgasm on the stage.
He's,
he's sitting there on the stage.

87
00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:06.210
He's like,
ah,
and the audiences,
I'm talking people,

88
00:05:06.211 --> 00:05:10.690
I fall it out of their fucking chairs crying,
laughing,
you couldn't,

89
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.050
but it was real man.
And some people,
it wasn't real.

90
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.390
Like some people would look at him and you go,
hey,
hey buddy.
Hey Buddy,

91
00:05:16.391 --> 00:05:18.650
look at me.
Look at me.
You're not under good.
Come on.

92
00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.170
Come off and say this guy was like,
ah.

93
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.330
And the guy would come up to say he would know who was under,

94
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.870
who wasn't under this guy was a man.

95
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.770
He would work with people who are trying to quit smoking and you're trying to

96
00:05:26.771 --> 00:05:31.210
quit gambling,
smoking thing,
gambling,
booze.
They can,

97
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.780
apparently they can do it with a lot of different things with it,
but it,

98
00:05:33.781 --> 00:05:37.750
smoking is a big one.
But he,
he just could do it to some people.

99
00:05:37.751 --> 00:05:38.860
And I'm telling you quick,

100
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.370
he would do it and there's fucking 300 people in the room,
but he would be like,

101
00:05:42.371 --> 00:05:44.440
I'm going to cut my fingers from the count of three.

102
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:47.260
You're in the car and the police are chasing you.
One,
two,
three.

103
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.110
What are you doing now?
I'm in the car.
The cops are chasing me.

104
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.400
And it was just instant man.
I mean it was,
it was some people,

105
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.180
they just fall into these states of mind and open to suggestions.

106
00:05:58.181 --> 00:06:02.390
Some people can be hypnotized.
And this is why some people I think join cults,

107
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.600
like I'm watching this new,
the Netflix program.
Wild wild country.
Yeah.

108
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.500
Fucking crazy.
Crazy.

109
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.800
But some people I think are more susceptible to suggestion and more susceptible

110
00:06:15.321 --> 00:06:19.010
to cults.
And I think that is,
that's what's happening.

111
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.680
I think that's what's happening with,
with this Allah phrenia thing.

112
00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:25.490
If that's what it's called.
Um,
I might be remembering that incorrectly,
but this,

113
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:27.860
this thing that being around his schizophrenia person,

114
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.880
like whatever weird error they're brain is making your,

115
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.380
your brain tunes into that air and you start going crazy too.

116
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.240
As soon as that shit made sense.

117
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.660
Miles like I gotta get the fuck out of here cause he's done.

118
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.490
He's harmless.
He's never heard anyone,
but he still,
you know,

119
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.030
these days he's what he's prop guy.
He's probably in his sixties,
nothing

120
00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.250
<v 0>shape.
But back then when he still knew of martial arts,</v>

121
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.700
oh he was stage a man who was dangerous,
but he never hurt anybody,

122
00:06:56.701 --> 00:06:59.430
but he knew how to.
And um,

123
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.630
so one day there's eastern avenue in Baltimore's,
for lack of a better term,

124
00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:07.170
the Ventura Boulevard of Baltimore shops everywhere and everything.

125
00:07:07.171 --> 00:07:11.910
And there was this one woman,
the had cut his hair one time and for him,

126
00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:16.270
excuse me,
to touch his head,
was a big deal for him.
This.

127
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.670
So he immediately fell in love with this lady.
Her name was Carissa.

128
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.350
So he went home and got his guitar.
And the thing about this guitar,

129
00:07:25.351 --> 00:07:28.800
like this dude would pawn his bed,
his guitar,
everything.

130
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:32.520
But that guitar was always out of tune.

131
00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.970
Exactly the same way.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Does that make sense?

132
00:07:35.971 --> 00:07:40.110
Okay.
So always fucked up,
but always consistently fucked up every guitar he had.

133
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.340
That's how he tuned it.
That's how he heard it.
Oh Wow.
So he writes her,

134
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:50.520
he writes her a love song and he wants to go up to her shop and now sing it for

135
00:07:50.521 --> 00:07:51.354
her.

136
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.820
So he goes up and he stands out in front of the shop and he's gets her

137
00:07:56.821 --> 00:08:00.540
attention.
He's got his guitar and he's gone.
It starts off where he goes.
He goes,

138
00:08:00.541 --> 00:08:04.730
Chris,
I love you and Baltimore accents.
Current name's Karissa.
But he says,
Chris,

139
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:08.910
Okay Chris,
I love you Chris.
I need you.
Then he goes,

140
00:08:08.911 --> 00:08:11.580
Chris had all died because of Chris at all crack cause I to die Chris at all.

141
00:08:11.581 --> 00:08:14.090
And she's freaking out like,
what the fuck?
Yeah,
like your eyes.

142
00:08:14.091 --> 00:08:18.890
So they call the police,
he gets arrested.
Oh No.

143
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:23.130
And he doesn't understand why he's arrested in his mind.
What did I do wrong?

144
00:08:23.131 --> 00:08:26.460
I just wrote a beautiful song for someone I care about and I wanted to share it

145
00:08:26.461 --> 00:08:30.750
with her.
So my cousins,
all of us were like,
we gotta go to court and watch this.

146
00:08:30.751 --> 00:08:35.300
This is going to offend because he's got,
he's got to go to court.

147
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:39.330
So they bring them out from tobacco.
Oh No.
And he stands up and it's a,

148
00:08:39.331 --> 00:08:43.290
it's a female judge and my,
his mom,
my aunt Margaret and my great aunt,

149
00:08:43.291 --> 00:08:44.071
my grandma's sister,

150
00:08:44.071 --> 00:08:49.071
but extended family big time and we're all there watching and the judge says ask

151
00:08:49.861 --> 00:08:52.350
the girl her side of things and she's like,
well this happened.
And he's like,

152
00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.930
she's like,
would you like to speak on your behalf?

153
00:08:54.931 --> 00:08:57.030
And like I just don't understand what I did wrong.

154
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.390
I wrote a song for someone I care about and I just wanted to share it and she's

155
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:04.500
like,
would you mind sharing some of the lyrics of,
we're all like,
oh shit.

156
00:09:04.501 --> 00:09:07.400
And He fucking Chris,
I love you Chris.

157
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.140
I need you crystal all crack cause I want to die.
She goes,
okay,
okay,

158
00:09:10.141 --> 00:09:11.340
that's enough.
That's enough.

159
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.510
And then they're about to let him go because they understand I'm going to put a

160
00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:18.960
restraining order.
He's under supervision,
but they're about to let them go.

161
00:09:18.961 --> 00:09:21.780
And she goes,
oh wait a second.
Oh,
there's a,
Oh,

162
00:09:21.781 --> 00:09:24.510
there's still an open charge here on the books,

163
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.200
so we're gonna have to take you back to it.
He starts losing his shit.
Like what?

164
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.150
Maya?
Marguerite stands up and to a judge,
she goes,
Hun,
we dropped those charges.

165
00:09:33.151 --> 00:09:36.160
Everyone calls,
people hunt in Baltimore.
She goes,
Hun,
we dropped those charges.

166
00:09:36.161 --> 00:09:40.350
That lady said,
first of all,
you don't call me Hud.

167
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.470
I am a judge.
You address me as your honor.
We're all like,

168
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:48.650
I have augury got scolded by the judge and they fucking took him back and he was

169
00:09:48.991 --> 00:09:53.460
screaming going on.
They put,
uh,
the family put a charge on him.
Yeah,
he had,

170
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:57.600
he would do things like,
he would show up to their place in a cab demand.

171
00:09:57.601 --> 00:10:01.120
They pay for it.
They didn't,
he throw a brick through the window.
So they had a

172
00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.880
head of a resident for that Jesus Christ.
And they really did drop the charges,

173
00:10:08.881 --> 00:10:11.850
but it was just a clerical error that never made it to the paperwork.

174
00:10:11.851 --> 00:10:14.280
And she's like,
I got to do what I gotta do.
We're taking you back today.

175
00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:18.510
And he was,
they were pulling it back and he was gone nuts.
Oh my God.
Yes.

176
00:10:18.511 --> 00:10:21.750
It ended up that fucking haircut and he would say shit to him.

177
00:10:21.751 --> 00:10:24.780
He would swear to me that nurses would give him head in the hospital.

178
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.530
He would and,
and,
and part of the time,
I don't know,

179
00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:31.470
but one that really blew my mind was um,

180
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:35.550
he had to scab on his stomach and he was like,

181
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.700
they keep coming in and cut me in testimony and they're taking me to the doctor

182
00:10:38.701 --> 00:10:43.560
today,
Ryan,
I think I got something.
I think I got a disease and that,
that cut.

183
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.840
I'm like,
what are you going to do?
He's like,
I got a plan.

184
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.480
So I talked to him later that day and I was like,

185
00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:50.550
what did you do about that disease,
man?
He goes,

186
00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:53.070
you know what I did with that scab?
I picked it off and throw it away.

187
00:10:53.071 --> 00:10:57.050
He thought like the scab held the,

188
00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:59.940
and you could just pick it off the flick it away and be like,

189
00:10:59.941 --> 00:11:03.240
that shit's gone now Madison.

190
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.350
That's where he get that talk about it.
People,
it's not funny.

191
00:11:07.351 --> 00:11:09.810
Melted and it's not.
Mental illness is obviously not funny,

192
00:11:09.811 --> 00:11:13.920
but the shit he would do,
we would take him,
so it'd be me and my two brothers,

193
00:11:13.921 --> 00:11:17.460
his daughter and two Tucson's on Christmas Eve,
we'd go over,

194
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:18.870
we take them a plate of food,

195
00:11:18.871 --> 00:11:21.810
we'd hang out with them for a little while and shit and there'd be times where

196
00:11:21.811 --> 00:11:23.940
he's like,
you guys got a joint,
like we shouldn't be smoking.

197
00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:31.200
So we give them a joint and he smokes it and now we're driving back to my aunt's

198
00:11:31.201 --> 00:11:35.400
in the city,
which is 12 minutes away.
We get back.

199
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.870
What are you all given him?
We Hebrew,
he would rat us out.
He's like,

200
00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.950
Hey,
they came over,
gave him that food.
Thanks by the way.

201
00:11:43.951 --> 00:11:45.250
They give you a big fat joint.

202
00:11:45.251 --> 00:11:47.610
So then we would play it at why you listen to his crazy ass.

203
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.260
Nobody gave him like we all had to be able to say t

204
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.900
oh he would.
He,
he con he smokes.

205
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.030
He would come to my grandma's house when I live with her.

206
00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:02.980
He'd sit in a chair and he smoked cigarettes like this and he doesn't pull it

207
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.760
any farther away than three by three inches from his mouth and not just down

208
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:09.450
done down,
done.
And he'll do,
he'll go through three pack.
My,

209
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:12.730
his mom died of breast cancer and she would say all the time,

210
00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:16.240
I don't know how he even has a fucking throat left and I'm dying of cancer over

211
00:12:16.241 --> 00:12:20.170
here and he is,
he's still alive.
Still alive.
Smoking cigarettes like that too.

212
00:12:20.171 --> 00:12:24.070
Still Smoking cigarettes.
Like to chain a carton in three days.

213
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:28.630
What does a carton,
I don't even know.
20 packs.
That's roughly seven packs a day.

214
00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.500
<v 2>A day for,
for decades.
For decades.</v>

215
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.190
Oh my God.
That is so crazy.
Now what,

216
00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.730
do you remember what he was like before

217
00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:46.250
<v 0>schizophrenia?
I don't,
because when I was a kid he was already gone,</v>

218
00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:49.470
but my dad loved them and would bring them out to the house cause he was safe.

219
00:12:49.471 --> 00:12:52.320
He was just crazy.
He would say shit and he'd be like,
don't you know,

220
00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.170
don't give him a break.
Yeah,
don't vignettes.
Right.
Be Nice.

221
00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:58.320
They'll give them a bug in Britain,
but my dad would tell me all the time,

222
00:12:58.321 --> 00:13:01.980
he was a phenomenal athlete.
Like I said,
great at karate.
He had a black belt.

223
00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:06.660
He was cross,
no,
just a sweat.
He tried to tell me.

224
00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:10.350
So Highland town is the area where,
uh,
my aunt never is,

225
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.320
is the old Greek town in Baltimore.
It's not,
it's,
you know,

226
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.120
Greek as long gone in that neighborhood.

227
00:13:15.121 --> 00:13:18.420
But that's where he grew up and he would try to tell me that Highland town was

228
00:13:18.421 --> 00:13:20.250
the Haight Ashbury in Baltimore.
I was like,

229
00:13:20.251 --> 00:13:24.270
get the fuck outta here at that garbage.
But he was doing acid,
you know,

230
00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:29.130
early 11
and he dabble.

231
00:13:29.131 --> 00:13:30.330
I think he said that early.

232
00:13:30.331 --> 00:13:33.990
And then eventually after like into the college years,

233
00:13:33.991 --> 00:13:37.490
the 20s he really fucking ramped it up.
And he was all mine

234
00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.860
<v 1>before that.
Yeah,
100% he made himself crazy story.</v>

235
00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:45.840
The common story is people that have a tendency to schizophrenia or there may
be,

236
00:13:45.841 --> 00:13:49.800
they have a likelihood of developing it later in their life.
Acid trips,

237
00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:53.940
mushroom trips,
heavy.
Psychedelics tend to bring out schizophrenia.

238
00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.040
They tend to make it manifest.

239
00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:59.490
<v 0>So maybe he was ripe for it because there's,</v>

240
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:03.720
there's no other mental illness in the family.
It's just him.
Just him.

241
00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:07.490
<v 1>Um,
yeah,
man.
I think especially when you're young,
you know,
I mean,</v>

242
00:14:07.491 --> 00:14:11.390
think about how many people have had horrible,
horrible acid trips.

243
00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:16.430
Just taken way too much and tried to fight it and just been fucked up for days

244
00:14:16.431 --> 00:14:20.450
and weeks and then you still feel slippery.
Like life feels weird.

245
00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.680
Even after those trips,

246
00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:25.820
I had a DMT trip one time that fucked me up for a couple weeks.

247
00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.470
Like for a couple of weeks afterwards,

248
00:14:27.471 --> 00:14:29.840
I'd be driving my car and to be thinking there's going to be a car,

249
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:32.570
it's going to launch itself off the fucking,
the,
the,

250
00:14:32.571 --> 00:14:35.570
the oncoming lane and fly right into me.
I was thinking,

251
00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:38.270
I had this image that was going to be upside down in the,
the,

252
00:14:38.271 --> 00:14:42.230
the car was going to hit the windshield flying upside down and down and just

253
00:14:42.231 --> 00:14:45.810
slightly for weeks,
weeks,
weeks afterwards.

254
00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.050
That's why I'm scared of that shit.
It's because,

255
00:14:59.050 --> 00:14:59.130
<v 3>okay.</v>
