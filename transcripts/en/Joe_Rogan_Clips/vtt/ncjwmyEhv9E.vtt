1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.083
What is it?

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.620
I mean it has to be a lot of responsibility to try to give people advice and try

3
00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:09.890
to straighten her life out and show them the,

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.460
the flaws and the errors that they're making.
Yeah,
it is.
And you know,

5
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:16.770
people ask me sometimes they say,
you know,

6
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.560
doc field or problems,

7
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.270
you think problems are as simple as you make them out to be.
And the truth is,

8
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.740
I don't think problems are simple at all.
In fact,
I think problems are really,

9
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.220
most of the time,
pretty complex.
They're pretty layered.

10
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.850
They have a lot of different origins and they're oftentimes Comorbid.

11
00:00:37.851 --> 00:00:42.450
A lot of things exist together.
So I don't think problems are simple at all.

12
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.960
But to solutions are often simple.
Don't you think?
I mean,

13
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.120
it's kind of like the old joke.
You go the doctor and you say,
this hurts.

14
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.650
And he says,
well then don't do that anymore.

15
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.790
It's a lot of times it's very simple in it.

16
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.280
Somebody will have a complex thing that comes from childhood or maybe it's a

17
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.770
drug background or they've had trauma in their life,

18
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.580
but the solution is change your behavior.

19
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.940
I mean stop rewarding bad behavior.
Uh,

20
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.930
choose a different path in life.
Just behave your way to success.

21
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.330
Sometimes the solutions are very simple,

22
00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:22.650
even though the problems are very complex because at some point you have to stop

23
00:01:22.651 --> 00:01:26.760
focus econ.
Why?
And start focusing on what instead of why it happened,

24
00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:30.210
what am I going to do to change it.
So sometimes the solutions are pretty simple,

25
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.220
but implementing those solutions are often very,

26
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.610
it's often very difficult for people to change their lives,

27
00:01:35.611 --> 00:01:39.990
change their patterns.
It is.
And,
and patterns is the key.

28
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.820
Um,
you know,
nobody does anything in pattern if they don't get a pay off.

29
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.020
And if you can identify,
that's why,

30
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.390
that's why insights so important.

31
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.560
That's why I think it's the number one outcome to whether somebody is going to

32
00:01:55.561 --> 00:01:58.350
respond to a talking therapy.
For example,

33
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.280
if somebody can identify what their payoff is,

34
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.010
where they really can figure out,

35
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.730
I'm doing this repeatedly and my payoff is I don't have to work,

36
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.440
or I don't get held accountable for this,

37
00:02:13.441 --> 00:02:16.920
or I'm escaping accountability over here,

38
00:02:16.921 --> 00:02:20.760
or I get attention or sympathy.
Or if they can figure out what their payoff is

39
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.330
and they can then control that,

40
00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:26.340
whether it's for themselves or their kids or whatever.

41
00:02:26.341 --> 00:02:31.070
If you control the currency,
then you can control the behavior.
Mm.
Yeah.
It's,

42
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.530
it just seems that people have a,

43
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.790
they have this comfort in their patterns and even if their patents are self

44
00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:42.750
destructive,
even it's drug abuse or alcoholism or did those,
those,

45
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.110
the comfort in those patterns falling into those patterns,

46
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.810
it seems very compelling to a lot of people.
Yeah.

47
00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:53.450
And pay offs don't necessarily mean that it's a positive payoff.
I mean,

48
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.900
the pay off for taking heroin as you get high,
and so you're high for a while.

49
00:02:57.901 --> 00:03:02.140
That's not a positive payoff,
but it's a payoff.
Right.
And if you,

50
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.210
if you get high and so you don't get a job and you don't take care of your kids,

51
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.490
that's a payoff.
That you're not doing things that you need do,

52
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.140
that you should be accountable for.
It's a pathological payoff,

53
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.290
but is a payoff nonetheless.
And so that does reward you,

54
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.850
even though it's a pathological payoff.
It's a pathological thing.
Uh,

55
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.210
you call it a reward and if you,

56
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.590
but if you can identify that when they say,
look,
I'm,

57
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.500
I'm not doing what I need to do and I need to stop rewarding myself in that way

58
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:37.810
and hold myself [inaudible] need to be there for my kid.

59
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.340
I tell my kid I'm going to be there every day and I don't show up because I'm

60
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:45.740
high on drugs,
then you know,
I need to stop doing.
I don't need,

61
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.140
I need to not let myself get away with that and instead require myself to show

62
00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:54.760
up for the kid.
When I say I do say I will,

63
00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.130
and then you see what's in the kid's eyes.
You share the experience with them.

64
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:03.040
Now that becomes your payoff.
So then you'll start showing it for your kid.

65
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.880
<v 1>Yeah.
How,
how many people take your advice?</v>

66
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.800
How many people just listened and try for a little bit and then bail?
You know,

67
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.890
<v 0>it's hard to say because I think our,</v>

68
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:19.891
sometimes our most productive guest are the ones that don't get it because the

69
00:04:22.331 --> 00:04:25.540
mail we get,
they'll say,
oh wow,

70
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.120
that guy didn't get her to that woman.
Didn't get it,

71
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.150
but I saw myself in them and I'll never say that again.

72
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.060
I saw them being such a right fighter or I saw them being so hard headed or so

73
00:04:40.691 --> 00:04:45.691
oppositional and I s I heard them say things I've said and they laughed and

74
00:04:47.771 --> 00:04:51.400
didn't get it.
I got it on.
Never do that again.

75
00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:56.401
So sometimes those that don't get it at all while they're there are the ones

76
00:04:56.741 --> 00:04:59.470
that are the best teaching tools for the millions of people that are home

77
00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:00.060
watching.

78
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.080
<v 1>Yeah.
That's interesting,
isn't it?
When you watch people fail and you go,
oh,
okay,</v>

79
00:05:04.081 --> 00:05:07.590
I see that in myself.
Yeah,
I just got to not do what that guy do it.

80
00:05:07.591 --> 00:05:11.100
And then also do you see the stubborn pigheadedness that some people have what

81
00:05:11.101 --> 00:05:16.020
they won't listen to advice and you could clearly see how they're ruining their

82
00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:18.120
lives by not being honest.

83
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.440
<v 0>Yeah.
And sometimes the story that we might have is maybe extreme where you say,</v>

84
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.870
I don't do all six things they're doing,

85
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.180
but I do two of them and they are in sharp relief to me.
So I get that.

86
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.500
I ain't going to do that anymore.

87
00:05:32.501 --> 00:05:37.060
So I mean that's where I think you get a pay off and you know,

88
00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:42.040
people go and find these things on the Internet.
I mean last year,

89
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.150
you know,
we have a channel where we put up,
you know,

90
00:05:44.151 --> 00:05:48.640
different clips from divorce shows or parenting shows or whatever.

91
00:05:48.641 --> 00:05:52.210
And we had over 2 billion views,
you know,

92
00:05:52.211 --> 00:05:55.450
last year are people just going and finding that information and looking at it.

93
00:05:55.451 --> 00:06:00.380
So know people are seeking the information out and looking at it beyond the show

94
00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:01.160
itself.

95
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.160
So they must be seeking information and we just don't have a good distribution

96
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:09.980
system for mental health in America.
So I think they look,

97
00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.440
I think they're hungry for it.

98
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.180
<v 1>They look for it.</v>

99
00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.520
Well there's so many people out there that are trying to do better.

100
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.140
They're trying to get their lives in order and you know,
shows like yours and,

101
00:06:19.141 --> 00:06:19.720
and you know,

102
00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.940
just advice shows people that are giving out inspiration and knowledge.
It's so,

103
00:06:23.941 --> 00:06:26.180
it's such an important thing for people to,

104
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.270
especially for people that didn't grow up with wise parents or they'd be a good

105
00:06:30.271 --> 00:06:31.440
support system around them.

106
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.240
<v 0>You know,
I think that that's true.</v>

107
00:06:35.241 --> 00:06:40.241
And I grew up with an alcoholic father and it was a pretty violent home and,

108
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.720
and he was a really bad alcoholic.

109
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.520
And I know having grown up in that,

110
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.570
you wind up with what I call a damage,

111
00:06:53.571 --> 00:06:58.571
personal truth and you feel second class and the problem that kids make.

112
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.900
And uh,
cause I know I did it and,
and I,

113
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.610
and I see others do it is you compare your personal truth,

114
00:07:10.611 --> 00:07:15.611
what you know about yourself and how you really live and what's really going on.

115
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.520
You compare your personal truth to everybody else's social mask because you go

116
00:07:22.461 --> 00:07:23.660
to school and you know,

117
00:07:23.661 --> 00:07:28.190
well I know that last night the windows got kicked out of my house.

118
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:33.380
I know that the utilities got turned off and I know there was a big fight in my

119
00:07:33.381 --> 00:07:36.770
kitchen last night and the kid sitting next to me,

120
00:07:36.771 --> 00:07:41.720
he's got on a shirt that's all ironed and his face is all bright and clean and

121
00:07:41.721 --> 00:07:41.961
you know,

122
00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:46.580
he looks like he's just got it all together and you compare yourself to that

123
00:07:46.581 --> 00:07:50.360
person,
that kid and you feel like you're second class.

124
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:55.520
And the problem with that is we generate the results in life we think we

125
00:07:55.521 --> 00:08:00.440
deserve.
So if you think your he is,
do you think you're second class?

126
00:08:00.441 --> 00:08:01.640
You will generate

127
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.200
results that you think a second class person deserves.

128
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.860
So if you don't fix your personal truth,

129
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.270
then you'll spend the rest of your last saying,

130
00:08:12.271 --> 00:08:16.100
well you know those really good results,
those belonged for somebody else.

131
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.950
It's not for me as for somebody else.

132
00:08:18.951 --> 00:08:23.900
And you'll settle for second best and you won't get what you might otherwise

133
00:08:23.901 --> 00:08:26.360
generate for yourself if you don't fix your personal truth.

134
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:32.270
And so I think a lot of people are struggling looking for a way to kind of get

135
00:08:32.271 --> 00:08:36.420
out of feeling not good about themselves.
And damage,
self esteem,
damage,

136
00:08:36.421 --> 00:08:39.960
self worth,
and they really don't know where to go.
So,
uh,

137
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.650
and that's why I do the show.
I don't look,

138
00:08:42.651 --> 00:08:45.890
I'm not down to the misapprehension that we're doing eight minute cures up
there.

139
00:08:45.891 --> 00:08:48.350
I mean,
come on you,
we're not doing that.

140
00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.830
But I think if you can point people in the right direction,

141
00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:55.800
if you can raise their awareness,
you can get them thinking about it.

142
00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:58.830
You can create a narrative where they at least say,
you know,

143
00:08:58.831 --> 00:09:03.510
how do I feel about myself?
I mean,
is there stuff I need to resolve?

144
00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:06.960
I mean,
what am I saying to myself?
If you can get them thinking about that,

145
00:09:06.961 --> 00:09:08.700
then you know,
maybe you've done something.

146
00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.070
<v 1>Yeah.
You know,
Tony Robbins once said once said,</v>

147
00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.450
it's incremental changes over the long haul and the way you have to look at it

148
00:09:14.451 --> 00:09:17.870
as if these two boats are going in a parallel direction and one of them just

149
00:09:17.871 --> 00:09:20.570
shifts five degrees over the course of time,

150
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.870
this boat is going to be in a far different place than the other boat that's

151
00:09:23.871 --> 00:09:25.370
going in the same way.
It was always going.

152
00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:26.531
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

153
00:09:26.531 --> 00:09:31.531
And the important thing to realize as well is the next year it's going to go by

154
00:09:31.631 --> 00:09:34.950
whether you're doing something about your life or not.
I mean,
we're,

155
00:09:34.951 --> 00:09:39.951
we're sitting here right now at the end of February and the next 10 months are

156
00:09:42.821 --> 00:09:47.500
going to go by whether somebody is working to make change or whether they're
not.

157
00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.660
And they may think,
you know,
Oh my God,

158
00:09:49.661 --> 00:09:53.800
I'm so far away and I'll never get her under control or I'm so behind in my

159
00:09:53.801 --> 00:09:56.980
bills or I'm so,
uh,
you know,

160
00:09:56.981 --> 00:10:01.450
just depressed or everything is so out of control.

161
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:06.210
Well,
you know what,
you make those incremental changes and then you know,

162
00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.770
pretty soon in December you go,
Hey,

163
00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:13.330
I'm way better off than I was at the end of February.
So Shit,

164
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:17.290
you made little changes and they all ended up and if you don't,

165
00:10:17.291 --> 00:10:20.320
by the end of the year,
you're just in deeper.
So every little bit matters.

166
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:22.650
<v 1>Yeah.
I,
I tell people to write things down.</v>

167
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.860
I say one of the best ways to get things done is to write things down.

168
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:27.810
Write down what you're trying to get done.

169
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.720
Write down what you need to get done on a longterm basis and what you need to

170
00:10:30.721 --> 00:10:34.110
get done in a short term basis and write off a checklist.
Force yourself.

171
00:10:34.111 --> 00:10:34.944
Be Accountable.

172
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:39.180
You know the difference between a dream and a goal is a timeline and

173
00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:41.730
accountability.
Accountability is gigantic.

174
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.200
<v 0>You got to have somebody it,</v>

175
00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:47.900
whether it's yourself or a friend or somebody that's going to say,
look,

176
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.020
did you do what you said you were going to do by this time?

177
00:10:51.021 --> 00:10:54.380
And if you don't hold your feet to the fire,
because I mean,

178
00:10:54.381 --> 00:10:59.060
just sitting around dreaming some day,
some day I'm going to get a different job.

179
00:10:59.061 --> 00:11:03.920
Some day I'm going to change.
This will someday ain't a day of the week.
You know,

180
00:11:03.921 --> 00:11:05.990
there's Monday,
Tuesday,
Wednesday,
Thursday,
Friday,
Saturday,
Sunday.

181
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.220
Look on your counter some days not on there.
So you gotta say,
okay,

182
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.490
I want to take this small step by here,
this small step by their,

183
00:11:13.491 --> 00:11:16.040
this most hit by there.
And then pretty soon,
you know,

184
00:11:16.041 --> 00:11:19.670
we don't leaps tall buildings in a single bound.
We take it a floor at a time.
