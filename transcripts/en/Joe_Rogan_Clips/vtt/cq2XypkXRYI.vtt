1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.060
I was dying and I realized,
all right,
you know,
I need to keep working.

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.510
What am I gonna do?
I went back and revisited some of these songs,

3
00:00:06.511 --> 00:00:08.130
but I realize I have to rerecord them.

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.150
That's why I didn't see that they were my songs because I recorded into my way

5
00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:16.170
that I thought other people would want to use them.
So I went and recorded about,

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.840
I dunno,
five or six of the songs that were already here.

7
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.070
And then my buddy evidence from dilated peoples,
um,

8
00:00:23.071 --> 00:00:26.070
got involved with me and we recorded a few of these rap tracks and it started

9
00:00:26.071 --> 00:00:28.800
kind of coming together and it kind of started coming together in a similar way

10
00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:31.370
that the original Whitey force things to blues record did.

11
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.620
That's why I kind of also named it what it is.
Um,

12
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.770
there was a lot of similarities and I feel like I just pulled everything from

13
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.950
every part of the toolbox that I've learned from since I started.

14
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.660
You know what it was the ice tea years are the house of pain years or the Whitey

15
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.710
Ford years.
I just drew on it all and trying to see what you're,

16
00:00:51.711 --> 00:00:53.550
like I said it was in the eight years of life,

17
00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:57.990
it's not like a literal representation of what's happened to me,

18
00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:01.640
but it's an emotional journey of like all the kinds of feelings and shit that,

19
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.540
a lot of struggles and a lot of it's,
it's,
it's,
it's my best record,
you know,

20
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.690
but eight years right here.
So I've never been in a rush.

21
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.540
That's a big statement that it's your best wreck.
It's my best record ever.
I'm,

22
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.660
I'm confident in it.
Is it available everywhere?
Like on a file stream,

23
00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:22.080
the shit out of it.
I own my masters.
I mean how does that work?

24
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.760
If you own your masters,
do you get more stream?
Well,
if you own your masters,

25
00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:30.090
you get paid outright.
Like,
you know,
you're the label on my own label.

26
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.140
So that people that complain about not getting paid by streaming or people that

27
00:01:34.141 --> 00:01:39.141
are signed to record deals that are getting a small piece of what the masters

28
00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:42.650
getting.
Uh,
if you own the master,
you know,

29
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.390
you still streaming is viable for someone who owns the master.

30
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.730
I mean as viable period.
I mean kids,
I mean that's the way it is.
It's just the,

31
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.660
it's the future.

32
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.060
But the people who say it doesn't pay their in shitty deals,

33
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.000
you know what I mean?
Cause it,
it pays.
No,
I would like it to pay a little better,

34
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:02.310
but you know,
it pays.
It pays all right.
Who Was it?

35
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.110
I think if you take a million streams it equals out to around $8,000.

36
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.240
That sounds like it just in general,
like that's the payment for it,

37
00:02:11.241 --> 00:02:14.250
for what that is to have to a label,
like it would be around a label,

38
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.480
like a million streams is,
is about the equipment,
about eight grant.
And uh,

39
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.940
that doesn't sound like a lot,
but a million streams is like,
you know,

40
00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:24.840
a thousand guys that,
or people,
fans of yours that stream your shit,
whatever,

41
00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:27.150
a thousand times,
a hundred times.
Right.
You know,
it's not,

42
00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:27.990
it goes quicker than you think.

43
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.710
I think Drake like streamed a billion streams as first week.
Right.
You know,

44
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.990
that's a nice chunk of change,
man.

45
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.740
David Crosby was tweeting about how bad streaming deals are,

46
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.790
but that is because he has a bad deal as he doesn't own his master.
Yeah.

47
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:42.160
If he does,

48
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.540
if he's like recording a deal for another record for the record company,

49
00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:48.900
you know what I mean?
Then he's all his older songs.
Oh,
that's,
yeah.

50
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.660
Then he's probably got shit deals and I mean,
some of my older stuff,

51
00:02:51.661 --> 00:02:54.510
I don't get paid on what I feel like I should,
but it's like the stuff,

52
00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:57.900
since I've owned my masters,
which is the last 15 years of my life,

53
00:02:57.901 --> 00:02:58.734
you know what I mean?

54
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.950
It's fascinating from me on the outside looking at what happens with labels and

55
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:06.190
how the,
how they do things.
It's,
it's just,
it's amazing.

56
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:08.080
They're sort of survival instincts.

57
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:13.081
Have they figured out how to stay in Naples or signing podcasters now because of

58
00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:17.980
streaming,
streaming tech?
You should be getting checks from this,
Joe.
I don't,

59
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.920
I don't allow them to stream me,
but would honestly,

60
00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:23.710
you could be coming Dora Spotify,
I say,
nope.
Well,

61
00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:26.730
you'd probably have to be exclusive to one of them is the deal too.
Um,

62
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.840
well either way what they are is just,
it's not just streaming.

63
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.160
Your Youtube views are streaming.

64
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:36.700
That's streaming doesn't have to be with a streaming service.
Right.
I mean,

65
00:03:36.701 --> 00:03:40.090
but you,
you should have a digital company that is representing you,

66
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:42.970
that's collecting all that.
If you don't yeah,
no,

67
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.320
I do for that and just make sure.
Yeah,
but that's like that's all streaming.
It's,

68
00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:48.310
you know what the youtube thing,

69
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.710
the most fascinating thing about it is that there's only youtube.

70
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.180
That's the crazy thing.

71
00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:55.840
We think about how big the Internet is and there's really only one thing like

72
00:03:55.841 --> 00:03:58.510
youtube,
it's a,
it was a good moment.

73
00:03:58.511 --> 00:04:02.090
They came and the branding and everything they did,
I saw like,

74
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.630
I don't know if it was a documentary because it wasn't full length,

75
00:04:04.631 --> 00:04:07.720
but it might've been just like a little like feature like it within a news kind

76
00:04:07.721 --> 00:04:09.700
of segment thing about how,
you know,

77
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.560
the original videos that were huge on on youtube where like a kid biting another

78
00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:17.350
kid and like their original first for the longest time,

79
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:20.990
the most played video on youtube was the Charlie biting the kid or something.

80
00:04:20.991 --> 00:04:23.080
You know?
And that's where it all came from.

81
00:04:23.081 --> 00:04:27.970
Like it almost came from America's home video of funniest home video kind of

82
00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:30.810
thing.
Youtube kind of filled in that void for a long time.

83
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.870
They were memes before there were memes,
they were just viral videos,
you know,

84
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.460
so long ago.
That's crazy.
It's like a decade ago.
And that,
well,

85
00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:44.290
I mean the necessity of having to change the music business is what changed

86
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.071
youtube,
you know,

87
00:04:45.071 --> 00:04:48.910
because they caught on like our itvs and I was in play videos anymore and

88
00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:51.970
nobody's buying records.
So we got to,
so you know,
the whole,

89
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.330
the whole thing for the longest was like when the bottom had really fallen out

90
00:04:55.331 --> 00:04:59.320
for a while of making any money off of actual records was like,

91
00:04:59.321 --> 00:05:01.900
well you can bootleg my record and you can download my record,

92
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:06.310
but you can't download the tee shirt.
I,
I,
so it became sell the lifestyle.

93
00:05:06.311 --> 00:05:10.090
So the music became background music to the,
you know,
everything else.

94
00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:13.210
It was a part of the lifestyle and the cars and this and all I wanted you to do

95
00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:16.540
is really go by this limited edition tee shirt that I'm sending you right now.

96
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.373
You know what I mean?

97
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.590
That's what that's the game changed into and it's still that,

98
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.440
you know what I mean?
That's why the fuck are we in the troll Islam and all that.

99
00:05:23.441 --> 00:05:24.940
Because people want eyes on them.

100
00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:29.140
So the next thing they have the opportunity to sell,
they can sell.
Yeah.

101
00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:32.590
That's what's interesting to me about labels is now labels get a piece of

102
00:05:32.591 --> 00:05:36.960
everything.
They do these three 60 deals,
that's Satan correct scene.

103
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.000
That was unheard of.
You didn't get pieces,
not only t shirts,
there's,

104
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.980
you get pieces of it,
they get a piece of live money.
You get every,
you know,

105
00:05:43.981 --> 00:05:48.610
and it's like how it used to be like I had to pay you.
I used to be like,

106
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.060
all right,
a record label would give me half a million dollars.
All right.

107
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.340
And I'd go and make a record with that.
I'd have,

108
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.770
I could spend whatever I want to make an a record and whatever the rest of money

109
00:05:57.771 --> 00:05:59.840
left over was mine.
That 500 grand was mine.

110
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:03.200
I can spend it all making a record or I can spend 50 grand making a record and

111
00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:07.910
pocket the rest.
That was up to me.
Um,
and then after that,
my GI,

112
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.770
your job was a label is to sell that record.

113
00:06:09.771 --> 00:06:13.850
My job was to hit the road and go tour and I go to her for a few years and at

114
00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:15.740
first I'm not even making money to her.

115
00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:18.560
And you're giving me money to go out there and sore.
It's called tour support.

116
00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:23.090
That used to be,
and that actually gets added onto your bill paid?

117
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.400
No.
You would get like money for tour,

118
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.360
but like it wouldn't cover like a bus and a band and all this so that the label

119
00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:31.730
would supplement that with what they called tour support,

120
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.760
which would also become part of the debt.
You owe the label,

121
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.180
but as you build your live audience,

122
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.520
your guarantees would go up sooner or later.

123
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.520
You could stop taking that money and then your record sales would pay that off

124
00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:46.131
hopefully.

125
00:06:46.131 --> 00:06:49.430
If you were doing well enough and now you got your own stream of revenue with

126
00:06:49.431 --> 00:06:52.910
live t shirts,
all this other outside shit that it's yours.

127
00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.170
That's the way it was when I came up.
Now it's like that's not a deal.

128
00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.840
They want it all out.
How'd they sneak that in?

129
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.520
Because when Napster and should drop the bottom out of the record business,

130
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:04.910
nobody was paying for records.

131
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.900
Labels weren't gonna give you a half a million dollars just for your record

132
00:07:08.901 --> 00:07:12.050
because nobody was buying records.
They want to sell your tee shirts too.

133
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.460
It's that amazing note.

134
00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:16.640
They figured out how to stay alive like that just because they always knew that

135
00:07:16.641 --> 00:07:18.600
people are going to be needy.
It always it.

136
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.950
It all boils down to this too and I host somebody one day like really

137
00:07:21.951 --> 00:07:25.580
investigates this and make some sort of like documentary about it is like they

138
00:07:25.581 --> 00:07:29.120
had so many opportunities to be ahead of the movie industry didn't take the same

139
00:07:29.121 --> 00:07:32.600
hit.
They took hits and they deal dealt with piracy,
but they,

140
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.600
the music industry had a moment.
If you remember,

141
00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:39.230
there was like some kids they got in trouble for downloading ridiculous amounts

142
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:42.920
of music and their parents were being held responsible and the music industry

143
00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:46.400
backed off of it because the news wasn't good.

144
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.220
The movie industry never backed off of that kind of shit.

145
00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:51.470
They've told you we're going to fucking sue your life off.

146
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.670
People did get sued for your music,
but the music industry backed off though.

147
00:07:55.671 --> 00:07:58.780
They didn't put the pedal down and keep the foot on the neck like you're going

148
00:07:58.781 --> 00:08:01.910
to steal this,
this costs.
You got to remember back then,

149
00:08:01.911 --> 00:08:04.580
if I would've got a half a million dollars,
I probably would have spent up to,

150
00:08:04.581 --> 00:08:05.690
to have that on a record,

151
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.950
$200,000 just on them making studio time.

152
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.720
Whoever's got to be involved in engineers,
producers,
200 grand off top,

153
00:08:14.721 --> 00:08:17.750
just that's minimum we would have spent on a record.
And then it gets,

154
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.540
you go out and people steal it.
Right.
You know what mean it's the same,
you know?

155
00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:24.050
Did you ever download shit for free?
Um,

156
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.990
my thing we not at first my thing became later like,
okay,
this is what they,

157
00:08:29.991 --> 00:08:32.510
this is the wave,
whatever.
But if I doubt my,

158
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:36.320
my philosophy was if I downloaded your shit and I liked it,

159
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.290
I would go,
I'd go buy it.
Like I,
if I,

160
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.130
if I download it and it was trashed and bay,
I looked at it as like a taste test.

161
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:47.660
That's okay.
Okay.
Maybe if more people adapted that things would it.
But again,

162
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.590
the record industry had plenty of opportunities to jump ahead of it.
And B,

163
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:51.981
they didn't,

164
00:08:51.981 --> 00:08:54.440
there was technology out there already that people were dealing with.

165
00:08:54.441 --> 00:08:56.670
Sound bringing it so that I'm telling him and this wave is coming.

166
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.220
So when the record industry was making so much money at that time,

167
00:08:59.221 --> 00:09:02.190
if you look at the amount of money they were making off of the boy bands and the

168
00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:02.911
Brittany Spears,

169
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:07.140
is it not that it was retarded how much money was in the record business and

170
00:09:07.141 --> 00:09:10.380
they let it all go down the drain because they thought they had all the answers

171
00:09:10.381 --> 00:09:13.230
and they thought it had it.
No one money.
What could they have done to stop it?

172
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.850
I'd have to go,
I have some books on it.

173
00:09:15.851 --> 00:09:18.180
It sounds like there was taking out a lot hole for string equal.

174
00:09:18.181 --> 00:09:21.510
There were people ready there to help set up things like nasty and how to

175
00:09:21.511 --> 00:09:24.450
monetize it and control it.
Like there was ways to deal with it.

176
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:29.250
There were ways to be part of it instead of like wait until it was too late.

177
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.110
Well,
think about the movie industry too though,

178
00:09:31.111 --> 00:09:35.780
is that people want to go to the movies.
Like the experience is not as good.

179
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.810
Apple music saved the music industry like apple at first.
Itunes.

180
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.200
Why didn't the record history like there were people telling them this is coming

181
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:44.100
and I didn't mean to interrupt you,

182
00:09:44.101 --> 00:09:48.300
but it don't think they could've made iTunes first,
not called iTunes,

183
00:09:48.301 --> 00:09:52.620
but like it's security industry itself should have had digitized and been ready.

184
00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.530
It would have been asked simple come up with their own version of iTunes and

185
00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:00.390
they could have invested a lot more money to music industry is booming,

186
00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:04.080
but artists are losing big because most artists are signed to record deals with

187
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:05.790
just 12% of revenue.

188
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.140
12% whoa.

189
00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:14.880
$43 billion a year was its most profitable year since 2006 Yup.

190
00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.870
Listeners to spending more money than ever,

191
00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:22.320
largely on streaming and live music with consumer spinning tow totaling more

192
00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:25.240
than $20 billion last year.
Wow.

193
00:10:25.241 --> 00:10:28.360
Yet artists aren't feeling the increase of that 20 billion music industry

194
00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:34.020
entities such as record labels took home 10 billion musicians taking home just

195
00:10:34.031 --> 00:10:38.080
5.1 billion with the majority of their revenue coming from touring and concert

196
00:10:38.081 --> 00:10:42.580
sales.
It's amazing.
That's amazing that it's like a parasitic industry.

197
00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:43.870
It's like you,
they don't,

198
00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.980
people don't necessarily need them the way they used to it.
Nina.

199
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:50.080
Not they'd like they used to.
I was going to just play devil's advocate and say,

200
00:10:50.081 --> 00:10:53.750
well,
it used to be that I'm the guy to put up all the,
if I'm the label,
Oh,

201
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.070
I'm putting up millions of dollars in advance.
Gambling it on you right now.

202
00:10:57.071 --> 00:11:00.370
When you,
when you want to take away my blind,
share it.
No.
Fuck you.

203
00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.310
Now it's totally different.
Now you can do this on your own.
Yeah.

204
00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.750
You know what I mean?
You could start an Instagram started youtube,
start this,

205
00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:11.080
and you can make beats on your laptop and like living wrapper.
Right?

206
00:11:11.081 --> 00:11:13.060
Isn't that the guy who does everything?

207
00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:17.700
Everything he's done is his own shit online.
Sure,
sure,
sure.
Yeah.

208
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.140
You don't believe it.
What do you mean?
Oh,

209
00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.120
Jamie's got a conspiracy theory conspiracy,

210
00:11:22.121 --> 00:11:26.950
but he's got more support than he would say now he does.
Sure.
Yeah.
No,
it does.

211
00:11:26.951 --> 00:11:30.550
Maybe,
but I mean,
basically he's become huge all on his own.
Right.

212
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:35.680
And you didn't meet me.
You look,
it's like so many viral music hits.

213
00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:36.700
You know they get,

214
00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:40.300
they get big online just because kids share it and they like it then then it

215
00:11:40.301 --> 00:11:43.930
becomes gigantic.
Like what the music industry that the industry,

216
00:11:43.931 --> 00:11:47.280
the labels have nothing to do with that,
right?
No they,

217
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:49.620
there's labels that are doing their thing after that.

218
00:11:49.621 --> 00:11:51.880
They actually know what they're doing and marketing wise and all that.

219
00:11:51.881 --> 00:11:55.780
And there's still a lot of kids that are being made famous by label.

220
00:11:55.781 --> 00:11:58.830
So there's some benefit.
I mean there's a lot,
at least not a lot of the reasons.

221
00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.990
Some of these artists are only seeing 5.1 minutes cause they're signed to record

222
00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:04.690
deals.
You know,
Jay z ain't only seen five,
you know,

223
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.440
5% of what you he's do cause he,
you know,
he's been in the game long enough.

224
00:12:08.441 --> 00:12:10.240
He know and they started out with their own label.

225
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.810
They started to bend the beginning.
Rockefeller records was independent.

226
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:15.940
So that's the kind of,
you know,

227
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:18.760
those guys and guys are never going to lose as long as you know,

228
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.480
they can still make music that people buy.
Yeah.

229
00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:26.580
They figure out a way to rope you in early to where like even if your record is

230
00:12:26.591 --> 00:12:28.370
successful,
the second record you,

231
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.970
it's not like you're going to be able to be independent in the second record.

232
00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:34.330
They'll you,
they own you for several down the line.
Right.
Usually,

233
00:12:34.331 --> 00:12:38.540
I mean it used to be,
I think the standard was like eight eight yeah,
it's that.

234
00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.820
But that's it.
That's,
it's,
it's,

235
00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.720
it's misleading because it depends on where you're from too.
There's also like,

236
00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:43.901
you know,

237
00:12:43.901 --> 00:12:47.080
if your first record is very successful and you have a lawyer that has anywhere

238
00:12:47.081 --> 00:12:49.480
with all you're renegotiating before you do a second record,

239
00:12:49.481 --> 00:12:50.800
you know what I mean?
These are things you learn,

240
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:54.910
but like if you're struggling at eight record thing too.
Also,

241
00:12:54.911 --> 00:12:57.280
if you study the record business,

242
00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:01.860
it goes back to like when actually artists used to be built that like over w

243
00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:04.300
nobody expected the first album to do anything.

244
00:13:04.301 --> 00:13:06.930
Like when they would sign bands like in the 60s the bike,
but you know,

245
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.220
they had a plan like my album three and four here's where we'll be.
You know,

246
00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:11.530
they used to build artists.

247
00:13:11.531 --> 00:13:16.360
They used to be a and are they actually used to nurture and fucking take care of

248
00:13:16.361 --> 00:13:18.250
a band for a long time and watched them grow.

249
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.040
What I mean that's the way it used to be until like,
you know,

250
00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.610
whatever it was maybe the 80s it changed.

251
00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:28.750
I had a record deal for my comedy album in 1999 I had a record deal with Warner

252
00:13:28.751 --> 00:13:32.380
brothers.
It was like a real record deal,
like good met with them.

253
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.710
They promoted it,
the look,
the whole deal.

254
00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:39.520
It was like I went through the whole record industry business.

255
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:41.610
There was always a comedian or two on labels.

256
00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:46.510
I don't have that anymore because Tom many albums,
they're do it yourself.
Well,

257
00:13:46.511 --> 00:13:48.820
it's not just that you definitely can do it yourself,

258
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:52.430
but comedy albums just aren't that popular anymore for some strange reason.
Well,

259
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.690
because it's,
it's,
it's a piss poor.

260
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:59.380
It's also the art form you want to watch it exactly was about to say it's so,

261
00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:04.410
it's so visual that now comedy albums were big when everybody didn't have a TV

262
00:14:04.421 --> 00:14:07.270
screen or everything.
He was like,
you could listen and imagine what we,

263
00:14:07.271 --> 00:14:08.100
what he was doing or saying.
