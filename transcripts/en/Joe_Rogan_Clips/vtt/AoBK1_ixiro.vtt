00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.200
Hello Freak bitches.
This part of the,

2
00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:06.450
what I like about the Internet is like,

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.730
did you read or did you listen rather to the radio lab podcasts on Shiloh,

4
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.990
the mouth Lebouf and now I didn't answer the fucking great.
I sent it to Jamie.

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.530
It's fucking great.
What is it called again?
Twitter Truth trolls.

6
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.590
You have to find it because they took it down.
How do you take it down?

7
00:00:22.591 --> 00:00:23.460
I just got enough.

8
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.000
You had it already downloaded on your phone because you've our auto download

9
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.240
Radiolab podcast,
so when I went to go find it I had to go search for it.

10
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:31.470
There was an,
I sent you that link.

11
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.220
They had taken it down the next day or something because people thought that

12
00:00:35.221 --> 00:00:38.100
they were endorsing endorsing that trolling.
Yeah,
exactly.

13
00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:40.290
They should be endorsing it.
It was awesome.

14
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.950
What the four Chan guys did was fucking amazing.
This is what they did.

15
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.570
Shai Lebouf.
So when I say his name,
whatever that fucking crazy assholes name,

16
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.380
he was doing some weird art piece where he like stood around with a bunch of

17
00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:58.560
other people and it was like,
he will not divide us.
He will not divide us.

18
00:00:58.561 --> 00:00:59.394
They would all say that.

19
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.980
And then all of these four Chan people found out about it.

20
00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:06.060
So they showed up and started yelling a bunch of fucking Trump shit still up

21
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.800
live right now.
The camera's still on this one.
All after that whole thing ended,

22
00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:14.100
they ended up like selling this to another company or our people when they're

23
00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:18.120
handling all of it now.
So shy names not attached to any,
so this,

24
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.900
he will not divide us thing.
Right.
He would go to these places and say,

25
00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:23.400
he will not divide us.
He will not divide us.

26
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.520
And people would show up and they would show up with like Keck is Stan shirts on

27
00:01:28.771 --> 00:01:32.010
with pepe the frog.
They would wear make America great again.
Hats on.

28
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.320
And they weren't even necessarily Trump supporters.

29
00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:37.320
They're just people trying to have fun,
right?
They're trying to fuck with people,

30
00:01:37.321 --> 00:01:41.250
right?
So what they did was Sheil above,

31
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.460
put up a flag in the middle of nowhere that said he will not divide us.

32
00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:51.921
And then had a live stream where you could go and look at the flag as it's

33
00:01:52.141 --> 00:01:55.830
waving in the breeze.
Right.
They found the fucking flag.

34
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.650
They found out where it was.
The way they found it was genius.

35
00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:01.230
And it's all detailed in this radio lab.

36
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.890
The fact they took it down is actually making me mad.
Why would they?

37
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.330
Because what these guys did was awesome.
All right.
First of all,
it was brilliant.

38
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.450
They found social media posts that showed that people had met Shilo Lebouf in

39
00:02:15.121 --> 00:02:17.500
some pieces that I say it's fucking name come off the bus.

40
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.850
They found out that they had met him in some weird place in Tennessee.

41
00:02:20.851 --> 00:02:22.800
So they triangulated where he would be,
right?

42
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.790
So then what they did was they went around,

43
00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:31.170
they had one of their members go round with a car and beeped the horn.

44
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.960
So they get to hear the horn on the camera.

45
00:02:33.961 --> 00:02:36.540
And once they heard the horn on camera,
then they knew he was there.

46
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.920
Or then they knew that the fire was there.

47
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.310
So then they found out where it is by stars.

48
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.380
They looked at the fucking stars and they figured out where the area is because

49
00:02:46.381 --> 00:02:47.250
when it's nighttime,

50
00:02:47.251 --> 00:02:50.070
you could see the stars on the live feed and they figured out what constellation

51
00:02:50.071 --> 00:02:54.240
it was.
They went to the fucking flag,
took it down,

52
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.260
put a make America great again hat on and a pepe the frog thing up there and the

53
00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:01.410
guy walks up to the camera and goes,
Fuck Shai Lebouf

54
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.220
and that's the end of it.
So great.
The fact of radio lab took that down.

55
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.400
That's depressing.
Why do they do that?

56
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.080
Did they not understand what's happening here?

57
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.070
Here's a here's is how they did it.
So like when he was moving around,

58
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.890
they found the log cabin he was in and they're like,

59
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.310
let's look for rental cabins that matched the wood pattern.

60
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.710
They were around 3000 rental caverns in Lappin Lapland.

61
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.930
We just need to match the wood patterns easier.
Just,

62
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.360
they just spend time doing shit like this or animals.
I fucking love this.

63
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.470
I don't understand why they were mad.

64
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.100
Here's the how they did it too.
But,
but this one,
I understand.

65
00:03:43.101 --> 00:03:45.760
I don't understand why radio lab would take that down.
Why don't you Google that?

66
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.770
Why did radio lab take down the Twitter truth or trolls?

67
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.090
Trolls,
trolls,
trolls,
whatever the fuck.
So Ray,
you,
you're listening to radio.

68
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.750
I've never listened to radio lab,
but what is it?
It's an amazing podcast.

69
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.570
It's really good news.
Or it's one of my favorite podcasts.

70
00:04:01.571 --> 00:04:02.950
They have all kinds of crazy shit on.

71
00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.240
I mean they have stuff on all sorts of different inch,

72
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.750
oh radio lab removes its truth trolls episode from podcast feed.

73
00:04:09.751 --> 00:04:13.470
And I suppose I was trying to find the actual cause it say why.
Yup.

74
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.600
They posted the reason why and this isn't second well what but it's saying that

75
00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:19.770
they removed it,
right?

76
00:04:19.771 --> 00:04:22.530
That was someone wrote in the article but obviously they removed it.

77
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.890
Editorial radio lab is decided to take down this episode.

78
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.730
Some listeners call this out saying that and telling the capture the flag story.

79
00:04:29.731 --> 00:04:30.600
And the way that we did,

80
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.670
we essentially condone some pretty despicable ideology and behavior.

81
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.451
Aw,

82
00:04:36.451 --> 00:04:41.451
come on to all the listeners who felt that way and everyone else,

83
00:04:42.541 --> 00:04:46.110
please know that we hear you and that we take these criticisms to heart.

84
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.300
I feel awful that the things we said could be interpreted that way.
That's on us.

85
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.430
It was certainly not our intention and we apologize.
Come on folks.

86
00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.080
You guys are missing the humor of this.
These,
these aren't despicable people.

87
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:06.140
They are saying things that are ridiculous because it's funny like there's a lot

88
00:05:06.391 --> 00:05:10.410
of people that say a lot of fucked up shit online.

89
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.670
Do they actually mean this stuff or are they saying it because they are

90
00:05:14.671 --> 00:05:18.840
anonymous and because it's fun to say fucked up things online that you're not

91
00:05:18.841 --> 00:05:22.200
supposed to say?
I would say the latter.
I don't.

92
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.320
I think there's a bunch of people that are really legitimately fucked up online.

93
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.440
There's a bunch of other people that think it's fun because they're stuck at

94
00:05:28.441 --> 00:05:33.150
some God damn soul sucking job in some fucking cubicle somewhere and they have

95
00:05:33.151 --> 00:05:37.020
access to the Internet and so they go on message boards and they fuck around and

96
00:05:37.021 --> 00:05:41.250
they troll this asshole Sheil above is a dumb dumb.
All right.
He's,

97
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.660
he's a fucking plagiarist.

98
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.740
I mean this guy has been busted for plagiarizing like giant chunks of other

99
00:05:46.741 --> 00:05:50.110
people's work.
Right?
Like what did he get busted for plagiarizing?
He's a,

100
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.270
he's in jail every couple weeks for being an asshole and being drunk and like

101
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.393
fool.
Yeah.

102
00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.160
I think that that Gig being a fucking movie star is insane.

103
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.990
I think it's insanely pressure filled.

104
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.250
It's way harder than what we do in terms of like dealing with all the people

105
00:06:07.251 --> 00:06:12.251
that like you and managing all the relationships and brief history of Shai

106
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.790
Lebouf copying the work of others.
Yeah.
It's like a ton of shit.
What does it say?

107
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:21.791
He played your eyes an apology to Alec Baldwin in 2013 he bluffed roughly quit

108
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.870
what would have been his first Broadway show orphans due to creative
differences.

109
00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:30.280
That is he couldn't get along with Alec Baldwin.
According to reports buff,

110
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.710
decided the best way to explain his departure would be to tweet out a photo of

111
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:37.780
his email apology to the cast and Baldwin by name.
Unfortunately,

112
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.900
parts of the prose sample a man owns up dot.dot.

113
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.040
A man Ellipsis,

114
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.300
a man grasps his mistakes was ripped off verbatim from a 2009 Esquire article

115
00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:54.590
titled,
What does a man,
people including the articles,
author notice.

116
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:59.810
Hmm.
BARF.
Yeah,
that's,
that's not that bad,

117
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.610
but it is easy to plagiarize a bunch of shitty plagiarize his directorial debut,

118
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:05.960
his short film,

119
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:10.990
Howard can tour.com premiered in 2012 Cannes film festival until it was posted

120
00:07:11.511 --> 00:07:14.990
online.
December 16th,
2013 that re,
uh,

121
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.800
viewers began to notice that the film is almost an exact adaptation of a graphic

122
00:07:18.801 --> 00:07:21.260
novel.
That's what the one by Daniel Close,

123
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:25.900
best known for ghost world close told,
budge,
buzz feed,
which uh,

124
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.290
bought much of this story to public light brought much,

125
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.620
much of the story to public light.

126
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.950
The first I ever heard of the film was the morning when someone sent me a link.

127
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.440
I've never spoken or met Mr Leboeuf.

128
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:41.240
I've never seen even one of his films that I can recall and I was shocked to say

129
00:07:41.241 --> 00:07:46.241
the least when I saw that he took the script and even many of the visuals from a

130
00:07:46.521 --> 00:07:50.810
very personal story I did six or seven years ago and pass it off as his own
work.

131
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:55.640
Yeah.
Wow.
I actually can't imagine what was going through his mind.

132
00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:00.620
He didn't apologize for plagiarism by plagiarizing a Yahoo answers post from

133
00:08:00.621 --> 00:08:02.450
four years ago.
God,

134
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.960
he says copying isn't particularly creative work.

135
00:08:05.961 --> 00:08:10.370
Being inspired by someone else's idea to produce something new and different is

136
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.630
creative work.
Uh Huh.

137
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:19.820
Well that's not totally copying what he said from the Yahoos answers,

138
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.980
but it's pretty God damn clothes,
whatever.

139
00:08:21.981 --> 00:08:26.600
He's obviously got mental issues and whether they're real or whether he's

140
00:08:26.601 --> 00:08:28.070
trolling or whether he,

141
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:31.850
whether he's having a psychological meltdown because of all the pressure of

142
00:08:31.851 --> 00:08:36.380
being an actor,
this is a shitload of pressure and being in transformers

143
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.030
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

144
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:47.290
yeah.
