1
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.550
The joe rogan experience.
Really.

2
00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.220
You put something in that book that really blew my mind.

3
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.250
You said that in 1975 and 76 in Hudson county where I'm from,

4
00:00:11.321 --> 00:00:14.750
there was 40 car bombings.
Oh Man.
40 car bomb.

5
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.840
I remember one bombings,

6
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.430
not all car bombings in Hudson county from seventh street.

7
00:00:21.431 --> 00:00:24.760
The 88th street there where you have bay on.
Oh,
boken.
That's up.

8
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.310
There was 41 car bombings system.
Correct.

9
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.350
<v 1>In the 70s in the u s where bombings,</v>

10
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:36.351
homemade bombs were like the preferred a weapon of organized crime.

11
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.850
There were,
there was a,
there was a bombing,

12
00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:42.170
Warren Cleveland over this Irish gangster in the 70s.
It was

13
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.180
<v 0>pretty common for Billy to,
they made a bomb with the nails to guy had gotten,
uh,</v>

14
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.220
the Sicilians are good bomb.
They did make a movie about Danny Green.
Yeah,
yeah,

15
00:00:52.221 --> 00:00:55.180
yeah,
yeah.
What was that movie called?
Kill.
Kill the Irish man.

16
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.060
And now that we're doing it again while they're doing the Irishman,

17
00:00:58.061 --> 00:01:02.930
a different movie.
Yeah.
It's fascinating stuff,
man.
Now,

18
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.370
did anything surprise you when you were,
you were putting me in,

19
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.610
obviously you're well versed in organized crime and well versed and these kinds

20
00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:10.990
of things.

21
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.190
<v 1>I think it,
uh,</v>

22
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.240
the dominant feeling people have when they're reading this book is the dominant

23
00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:19.720
feeling I had when I was researching,
which was,
why don't I know this shit?

24
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.700
I mean,
this is like really,

25
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.900
this is not only a great story really interesting,

26
00:01:25.901 --> 00:01:27.610
but it's really important history,

27
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.790
all this political connection to anti-castro movement and the role the u s

28
00:01:32.981 --> 00:01:34.390
government might have played in it.

29
00:01:34.391 --> 00:01:39.220
And the idea that this criminal conspiracy organization was allowed to go on for

30
00:01:39.221 --> 00:01:44.221
40 years because certain elements in the u s government didn't want to go after

31
00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:49.090
them because they were afraid it would open the lid on the Cuban relations with

32
00:01:49.091 --> 00:01:54.010
the sea,
the anti-castro relations with the CIA,
the politics of it.
That's,

33
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.080
that's,
that's not only interesting history.

34
00:01:56.081 --> 00:02:01.081
It's important history to understand a certain social political relationship

35
00:02:02.741 --> 00:02:07.330
between the US and Cuba,
the Bay of Pigs,
the residue of the revolution.

36
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.770
That's the way that shaped the cold war shaped us politics.

37
00:02:11.771 --> 00:02:16.060
Over a period of about 50 years.
So I was like,
why don't I know this?

38
00:02:16.061 --> 00:02:19.360
This is amazing.
This is like almost like a hidden history.
I mean,

39
00:02:19.361 --> 00:02:23.200
I knew what got reported in the newspapers,
but you know,

40
00:02:23.201 --> 00:02:24.520
you lift up the rug and you,

41
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.300
you look underneath the rug and you start to get into the details of it.

42
00:02:28.301 --> 00:02:33.301
It just makes me so aware that what we're receiving as information on a daily

43
00:02:33.611 --> 00:02:34.900
basis from the meat,

44
00:02:34.901 --> 00:02:39.901
mainstream media and everything is a version of what's happening.

45
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.060
There's a whole other version of what's happening in that we don't see.

46
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.650
And you usually only find out about it 30 years later,
30 years after the fact.

47
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.650
And that's a good thing to know.
No.

48
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.640
<v 0>Yeah,
I mean it sounds to me like this is,
uh,
I mean I've,</v>

49
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.130
I haven't heard a peep about this.
I mean,
when you brought this up to me,
Joey,

50
00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.540
and I was like,
what the organized crime,
the corporation.
What,

51
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.070
what is this like this is not discussed.
It's just not,
well,

52
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:07.660
hopefully this will change.

53
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.080
I grew up in it and I never talked about it because like I said,

54
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:13.620
I have a hundred stories.
We'd go for a ride.
I lose

55
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.660
a lot of shit.
I say him that I don't say it because number one,

56
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:23.800
you're not going to believe me and number two,
it's not my position.

57
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.250
I was raised enough for me to say,
you know what I'm saying?
Yes,

58
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.410
but I saw that as a child and then what made it worse than me?

59
00:03:30.411 --> 00:03:35.050
It was moving to North Bergen.
Once I moved to North Bergen,

60
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.430
I saw

61
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.320
what they would do in union city in a bigger way,

62
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.730
which is all political.
I swapped things that are,
make it tone drop.

63
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.260
That's why I don't give a fuck about politics and the like,
well,

64
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.600
I see people talking about politics.
I want to go up to him and go,

65
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.940
if you knew what you were talking about,

66
00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.090
you wouldn't say a word because you have no idea what real politics means,

67
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:04.330
how it works.
If it works like that in a micro system,

68
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.380
I can't imagine and a real so I don't want to pay attention to it.

69
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.790
Let me ask you a question because I,

70
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:17.760
I joined and I connected when I had more or less written this already.
Um,

71
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.060
if I had come to you way back at the beginning of this,
out of the blue,

72
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.160
all of a sudden this Guy Tj English,
I don't know,
you guess you knew the West,

73
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.560
so you knew who I was.
He knew I was legit.
If I had contacted you and said,

74
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.010
will you talk to me about this history when you have done it with everything,

75
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.520
I it would take us a week to debrief me.
So you would have been ready and we'll,

76
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:43.390
I woulda told you now you see what's interesting thing I would have known

77
00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:48.220
because somebody's Hacia here,
this fucking story.

78
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.200
He opened up the door for me.

79
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.760
I have a responsibility now that I have another story to add to this.

80
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.150
Yes he does.
I have the nuts and bolts of how this works.

81
00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.250
Have you thought about an addition to this?

82
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.610
I think there's going to be a number of spin off books from this.

83
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.890
This is really a book that comes from,

84
00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:10.810
this is going to tell their personal glory shot.
I will end up dead.

85
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.390
Really,
I will end up dead.
Not because of the,
because of what I'm exposed.

86
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.020
The where we know who did it in,
in uh,
in,
uh,
you know,
I grew up,

87
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.340
when I was growing up,

88
00:05:21.341 --> 00:05:25.390
the power in that Hudson county was the waterfront of Ge.

89
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:31.140
That picture in New York City that people see thousands of people died for that

90
00:05:31.661 --> 00:05:32.494
waterfront.

91
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.730
That waterfront was controlled by Wheelock,

92
00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.530
but everybody wanted a piece of it.
And North Bergen,
one of the piece of it.

93
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.620
So my eighth grade teacher was the Weehawken man.

94
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.450
You ever have a teacher that was a man?

95
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.130
Why would your teacher be a mayor of a town?
Why?
Why,
why?

96
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.290
Who's ever had a teacher tweet that was the mayor of a fucking town at the same

97
00:05:56.291 --> 00:05:59.500
time I did.
And guess what?
At the end of my eighth grade year,

98
00:05:59.501 --> 00:06:04.070
I show ATF come in and pull them out of that real,
I did 11 years.

99
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.090
Okay.
He doing,
he was selling the waterfront.

100
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.880
He all that,
that they knew that was miles.

101
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.600
There's a particular family that I will not mention because I won't even make it

102
00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:21.370
to the four oh five and they were buying that property up.

103
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.660
Look changes 16 no,
no,
no.

104
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.740
They were buying that property up in the 60s they were posing as politicians.

105
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.820
They chop up 30 million a month now between four and then sell it.
No,
no,

106
00:06:33.821 --> 00:06:36.860
no.
This is from all of the pop property.
They own it.
And Hudson county,

107
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.840
they bought everything.
Jersey City Hoboken.
They make their profit selling it.
No,

108
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.940
no.
They made them profit.
Renting.
Well,
renting it.

109
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.190
So the four of them before brothers Trump up 30 million.
They go their own ways.

110
00:06:49.191 --> 00:06:52.880
Every month they chop up 30 million.
So I switched from North Bergen.

111
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.240
When I tell you stories about calm mind bows,
I know he was a cop.

112
00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.700
He was a cop that I,
I got invited into.

113
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.970
He opened up his home to me and then his son died.
The one that was my age.

114
00:07:04.971 --> 00:07:09.380
So I became a pseudo sun.
So here I am running with the Cubans during the week.

115
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.250
They're talking about numbers and drugs and everything and I'm growing up in a

116
00:07:13.251 --> 00:07:17.960
cop's house.
That's also the driver for the mayor.

117
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:19.810
And he would do whatever.

118
00:07:19.811 --> 00:07:23.910
Like I saw him handcuffed dude's and throw a beat on him and they called him

119
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.720
Vinny the tours they called him Karma and the torch.
Balzac no,

120
00:07:26.721 --> 00:07:31.160
because his job was to burn your building down.
The last one he burned down.

121
00:07:31.161 --> 00:07:33.770
Kids were like Mr Mr that smoke and he's like,

122
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.480
here's $10 who can ice cream?
I'll call the fire department.
He never called.

123
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.140
He faked a heart attack.
So you don't have to talk to reporters.

124
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.250
First thing you do is you fake a heart attack cause you don't have to talk to

125
00:07:46.251 --> 00:07:47.084
reporters.

126
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.500
That gives you two days to get your story straight with the attorney that you

127
00:07:51.501 --> 00:07:53.810
have no idea what I know now.

128
00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.000
<v 1>Now the reason I asked showing the question about what whether he would have</v>

129
00:07:57.001 --> 00:08:02.001
been willing to talk is a lot of people reached out to me early in this book

130
00:08:02.431 --> 00:08:03.930
process.
The,
uh,
the,

131
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:08.310
the movie rights were optioned before I even wrote the book based on the book

132
00:08:08.311 --> 00:08:13.311
proposal and that got a lot of media attention and I started getting emails from

133
00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:19.370
nieces and nephews of sons and daughters of key characters in the story.

134
00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:25.130
And these were people like Joey who had kept this personal family history is

135
00:08:25.561 --> 00:08:27.130
bottled up bottled 30 years,

136
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:32.110
hadn't talked to anybody about it and now they saw I was doing this book and a

137
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:36.120
and I needed to get it off their chest.
They needed to talk about it.
I would go,

138
00:08:36.121 --> 00:08:37.080
I met these two,

139
00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:41.070
these two girls who were daughters of one of the guys who became a snitch,

140
00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.080
testified against the corporation.

141
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.960
The family went into the witness protection program.

142
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.200
These girls had never talked to anybody.
When I met,

143
00:08:49.201 --> 00:08:50.700
went to meet with them in a bar,

144
00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:52.920
they weren't even sure they were going to talk to me.

145
00:08:52.921 --> 00:08:56.100
We were just meeting to talk about whether they were going to talk

146
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.880
<v 0>to me.
I got to meet them.
They talk nonstop for three hours.</v>

147
00:08:59.881 --> 00:09:03.150
Once they thought they could trust me,
they just,

148
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:05.070
they couldn't stop talking about it.

149
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.240
They had all the stuff they needed to get off their chest.

150
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:12.810
We were raised not to say,
oh Gosh,
oh gosh.

151
00:09:12.811 --> 00:09:17.130
The first raid I saw,
my mother,
I was five.
They sat me on the couch and read it.

152
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:21.090
My mother had already thrown the coal golf about the total lady downstairs.

153
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.320
The landlord had already called and I said,
the cops are on the way out the door.

154
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:26.670
We lived on the west side,

155
00:09:26.671 --> 00:09:31.200
terrorist facing a new New Jersey and the lady downstairs,

156
00:09:31.201 --> 00:09:34.920
she would pay her rent and tell it,
hold this bag,
and my mother threw it.

157
00:09:34.921 --> 00:09:38.550
They came up,
sat us down.
They asked us to leave with the 88th street,

158
00:09:38.551 --> 00:09:41.910
88th street.
We never got raided.
When I moved to North Bergen,

159
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.490
I would get raided before I got raided.
The phone would ring and be calm.

160
00:09:45.491 --> 00:09:48.420
My Masano tell your mom,
clean the house.

161
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.720
I'd wake my mom up to others to clean the house and come over here.

162
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.340
I don't want you to see what's going to happen.

163
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:55.380
Cops will come with the rest of my mother.

164
00:09:55.381 --> 00:09:59.490
I would walk the coal mines house with my basketball right past the cops.

165
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.600
And it was that easy.
It was daddy's.
Wow.

166
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.360
Do you wish you ran into Joey before you started writing this?

167
00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:08.280
It would've been a different book.
He wasn't.

168
00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:13.200
Why I enjoyed this book so much is because no matter how much history this

169
00:10:13.201 --> 00:10:14.610
motherfucker dropped on you,

170
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.780
he let you know Jose Battle was,

171
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.440
he kept you reminded who hosts a battle was that's big for an author.

172
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.890
He never got away from Jose Battle.
And when you read the book,

173
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:33.390
no matter what type of person you are,
you kind of get mad at Jose Battle.

174
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.620
But there's something about Jose bally away cause you didn't,

175
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.160
you want that guy and you go on it.

176
00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:48.080
<v 2>Okay.</v>
