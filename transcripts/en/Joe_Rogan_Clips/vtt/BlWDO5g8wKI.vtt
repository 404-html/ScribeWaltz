1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.690
Do you have any other hobbies outside of a comedy?
And,

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.580
<v 1>um,
I'm not a big hobby guy.
Growing up,
my parents always used to say,</v>

3
00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:11.580
the lady,
what are you interested in doing it?

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.220
So I gotta be happy now.
Yeah.
And I'm like,
Holy Shit,
look,
you worked out.

5
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.110
My hobby is a standup comedy.
Really.
I mean,
um,
I like to cook,

6
00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:26.190
don't get me wrong.
I like to travel.
Um,
my wife and I really,

7
00:00:26.191 --> 00:00:31.080
really enjoy going to different places.
And,
uh,
I love hotels.
It's a,

8
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.300
I mean,
these aren't really hobbies.
It's just a,

9
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.190
I like hospitality.
So that's my,

10
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.920
that's my passion.
Uh,

11
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.950
I like having people over at the house and I'm making them feel good.

12
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.830
That's,
that's what I like to do.
I like to entertain.
Um,

13
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.450
if I find out you like a specific drink or you like something that's,
uh,

14
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.720
you know,
I,
I take,
I take notice of what people like.

15
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.890
So when you come to my house,
I got what you like there.
That's very talent.

16
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.330
It's very,
very Italian.
And,
um,

17
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.270
I've always had,
I,
you know,
I worked for the Four Seasons Hotel and a,

18
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.860
that chain taught me to anticipate people's needs.

19
00:01:13.861 --> 00:01:18.570
So anytime I have anything at my house,
whether it be a birthday party,

20
00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:20.790
it get together.
If it's going to be a fight,

21
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.820
I make sure when you come over you are taking care of not only with your alcohol

22
00:01:27.331 --> 00:01:31.770
needs.
Here's one.
I ain't a punt gay.
Right.
I don't,
I don't smoke pot.

23
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.080
We want to start.
I listen,

24
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.990
but I ain't got pot at the house just in case you want some really.

25
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.520
So I thought,
you know,
you have alcohol,
you have beer,
you have scotch,

26
00:01:47.521 --> 00:01:49.470
you have wine.
Right.
So what if,

27
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.120
what if someone doesn't have a taste for alcohol and they want a joint?

28
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.190
<v 0>Wow.
I got a couple of joints where you get it from PDC,
from the comedy store.</v>

29
00:01:59.191 --> 00:02:00.970
I think I got it from,
you know,
from,

30
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.490
<v 1>no,
I think it's a,
what's the Med med men.
Yeah,
men.
Yeah.
I went in there.</v>

31
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.330
He went in there specifically just for hospitality.
Hospitality.

32
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.270
If you came over and I go,
Joe,
you want to join?
And you're like,
hey,

33
00:02:17.271 --> 00:02:18.500
you want to smoke?
No,
I don't smoke.

34
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.830
You know there have edit just to have even a cigar.

35
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:29.200
I got to say,
God,
I don't smoke cigars.
You want one?
I,

36
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.123
I dunno,
I get,

37
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.310
I get joy in making others happy.

38
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.020
<v 0>So when you looked at your house,
did you look at your house and go,</v>

39
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.390
this is a good house to entertain in?
Ah,
yeah,

40
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.130
we see that like when you see like a youtube video on a home and they're showing

41
00:02:47.131 --> 00:02:50.370
the homes.
So a wonderful entertainers,
home,
entertainers,
home.

42
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.740
What does that mean?
A Sanger guys playing the piano.
It was,
I mean I like,

43
00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.150
I like a living room that bleeds into the kitchen.
All right,
that's,
that's,

44
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.990
<v 1>I like that,
right?
There's not really a a,
a wall in between the two.</v>

45
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:08.290
It's got to be,
and then I like indoor,
outdoor.
He live in California.

46
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:10.630
I like to go outside.

47
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:13.900
Maybe you want to have a drink outside and bring it back in.

48
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.860
Like the different,
that's what they want.
That's what they're talking about.

49
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:22.810
When it's a in there,
I like a fire outside.
Oh,
fire,
fire pit,
fire pit.

50
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.960
Do you try to bring people,
like if you have a party,

51
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:27.880
do you try to bring people over that you think would have interesting

52
00:03:27.881 --> 00:03:30.700
conversations?
Yes.
Um,

53
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.420
although we have a problem at this particular point,

54
00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:38.470
we're in a transition period.
Um,
we have a child,

55
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.460
so I don't know if you went through this,
but a lot of,
uh,

56
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.960
sometimes when you're coming from on a single couple but a couple with no kids

57
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.730
and now you have kids,
now you're,
you're finding other people who have kids,

58
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.590
right?
So that's what we're in.
We're a,
we're not yet into the preschool.

59
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.680
Uh,
so we're kind of in limbo.
We're looking for new friends,
right?

60
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.270
That are old friends are,
are bad.

61
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.620
It's just now we have other obligations.
We have a child.
We can't,

62
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.120
we maybe can't go out at the dinner at eight o'clock at night like we used to

63
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:16.720
now.
Now we're looking to bring it to the house.
Yeah,
no,

64
00:04:16.721 --> 00:04:17.800
I know exactly what you're saying.

65
00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:21.160
We went through that exact same transition and a lot of times you pick up some

66
00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:22.180
dead weight along the way.

67
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.330
You run into these people and the only thing they have in common is the kids are

68
00:04:26.331 --> 00:04:30.400
the same age and then they'd have to talk to some fucking guy.
Oh.

69
00:04:30.401 --> 00:04:33.590
And they give you ear beatings about their job and just like you,

70
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.880
just some people just not interesting.
It's unfortunate.
Yeah.

71
00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:41.620
I mean you do run into that where you meet a guy,
like I went to a toddler group,

72
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.510
uh,
last week.
Now some,

73
00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:46.750
sometimes I do this obviously because I want to hang out with my daughter.

74
00:04:46.751 --> 00:04:51.751
But sometimes the material that comes on at going to something like that is

75
00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:54.130
gold.
Now it's me,

76
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.520
15 women and a gay guy at this toddler group.

77
00:05:00.431 --> 00:05:03.670
Right.
So I mean it's just like,

78
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.680
it's almost writing if that writes itself,
although I'm in a,

79
00:05:07.681 --> 00:05:12.280
in a circle sitting Indian style,

80
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.840
hey,
it's,
it's strange,
but man,
it's,

81
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.020
that's the things I want to do because I feel if I live more of my life,

82
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.600
I could draw so much more humor from it.
And it's,
it's a,
it's,

83
00:05:28.601 --> 00:05:32.650
it's,
it's two pronged.
It's,
I want to hang out with my family and I want to,

84
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.250
I don't want to talk to people who are living in these life experiences because

85
00:05:36.251 --> 00:05:41.251
what I've noticed is I want to keep the same kind of lifestyle I've had when I

86
00:05:42.491 --> 00:05:46.990
wasn't successful because I feel that when you start detaching yourself from the

87
00:05:46.991 --> 00:05:50.590
daily routine,
let's say,
even going to target,

88
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.860
if you have somebody go to target for you,
you don't,

89
00:05:53.861 --> 00:05:57.400
you miss out on like what happens on a day to day.

90
00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.380
And I want to still keep that rich and,
and,
and,
uh,
available to me.
