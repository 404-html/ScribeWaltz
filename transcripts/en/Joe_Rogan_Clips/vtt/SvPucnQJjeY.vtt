1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.020
Yeah.
How many without booze,
boy,
that would be a struggle.
That would suck.
I mean,

2
00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:05.880
our whole job is entertaining drinkers.

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.330
I wonder what it would be like if we had liquor free comedy nights.

4
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.720
Have you played,
you have to have played like those we'd rooms.
Yes.
Yes.

5
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.960
Those are too crazy or insane.
We did the Toronto one.
The underground room.
Yup.

6
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.470
There was no air for the candles on the table.

7
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.850
The candles were running on a promissory note.
Yeah.

8
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.070
There was no oxygen in the room.
It was all just weed smoke.

9
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.100
I was onstage midway through jokes and having second thoughts like every linear

10
00:00:31.621 --> 00:00:34.500
thought was a tree branch that was growing where I'm like,
which one?

11
00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:38.400
White follow.
Well,
not only that,
what did I already talk about?
Yes.
What am I,

12
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.430
what am I covered?
All right.
I have no fucking idea.
Do you guys know?
Well,

13
00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:46.980
when I was doing it was doing it with Tripoli and Tripoli was sober at the time.

14
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.500
Okay.
But we walk in this room and the secondhand smoke is a fucking real thing.

15
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.930
That's what I mean.
I hadn't hit a joy going to wait until after my set.

16
00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:59.070
I don't like doing comedy high and I felt I felt high on stage and it's that

17
00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:01.410
thing where it's like,
well,
you just got to run with it.
You can't,

18
00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:05.240
you can't fight the tide.
Don't swim upstream.
You're not getting any better.
No,

19
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.690
you just got to keep going.
Ah,
I did.
There's a show that a guy,

20
00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:12.660
Andy Haynes had called midnight run where you'd smoke right before he got on

21
00:01:12.661 --> 00:01:17.661
stage and you just hit this big joint and I was doing great and then I had this

22
00:01:19.561 --> 00:01:24.060
huge setup and then my brain just the bottom fell out.
Everything fell out,

23
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.780
all ideas,
all thoughts,
my name and I just went.
It was like,

24
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.340
and then the girl turns to me,

25
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.390
I've got to go and I walked in the middle of a set up and then it was a crushed

26
00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:36.820
any cause people were laughing so hard because I just pulled the ripcord.

27
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.570
I literally was like,

28
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.720
I had a parachute that came out my backpack that pulled me out of the room.

29
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.040
Sometimes marijuana is your friend,
and sometimes it will fuck up your whole set,

30
00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:51.660
but sometimes it'll go,
why?
Why is that?
Then people go,
yeah,
why is that?

31
00:01:51.661 --> 00:01:54.570
And then you're off on this tangent that you probably would have never been on.

32
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.410
And that tangent might be the best part of that set.
Yeah.
I mean,

33
00:01:58.411 --> 00:02:00.370
I think about people that were like,
uh,

34
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.290
from very regimented backgrounds and went into the military,
you know,
in the 60s,

35
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:08.550
and then hit their first joint and went,
this is dumb.
Yeah,
I hate this.

36
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.080
What do they,
cause that's the thing about,

37
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.640
I found it about marijuana is it introduced true.

38
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.910
There's about myself that I found hard to face.
Uh,

39
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.560
and they were maneuver my new truth.
They weren't anything big that I,

40
00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:21.750
that I was afraid of or something,
you know,
that like,

41
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.940
I really want to kill someone or something stupid.

42
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.780
But it was just little things that would like bubble up.
And I think that's,

43
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.770
that's,
that's the craziest thing about that plant to me.
Well,

44
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.960
the idea that it makes you paranoid,
right?
That's it.
It's the paranoia,
right?
Oh,

45
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:38.700
I don't like pot.
It makes me paranoid.

46
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.000
I really think it makes you hyper aware of all sorts of things you've been

47
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:45.420
suppressing.
That's it.
Because when I'm feeling good,
when I'm happy,

48
00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:48.030
like I've been a good person.
I've been nice to,

49
00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:50.100
people have done the things I'm supposed to do.

50
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.080
I can get high and I enjoy the shit out of it.

51
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.550
But when I got loose ends [inaudible] I got things that are fucking with me,

52
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.880
you know?
Maybe like something that went wrong in my life or whatever,

53
00:02:59.881 --> 00:03:01.650
and then I smoked pot and then it just gets weird.
