1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.490
Um,
on his first jump off of the cliff in Italy,

2
00:00:02.491 --> 00:00:06.900
the first time you put a wing suit on and it's a,

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.100
that one stung a bit.
So it's on pause potentially forever.

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.330
As far as base jumping goes,
I'll still skydive.
But it's a,

5
00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:19.070
it's a question mark on the base jumping south.
You such risky shit.

6
00:00:19.071 --> 00:00:22.200
This guy that I was like,
yeah,
skydiving.
That's no big dust sky dive.

7
00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:25.590
I'll jump out of a fucking plane that I will do with my eyes closed every day.

8
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.800
That's the high risk ratio on that one is we're,
we're all set.

9
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.670
What is the risk ratio on skydiving?

10
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.930
Like what percentage of those things go wrong?
It's incredibly low.
Um,

11
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.340
so that you have a main parachute and a reserve parachute.

12
00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:42.630
I don't think there has been a true double failure.

13
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.520
Meaning your main parachute malfunctions,

14
00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:49.050
you cut it away properly and deploy your reserve parachute and have that also

15
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:53.700
fail in 20 some years.
People die skydiving all the time.

16
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.130
Well not all the time cause I guess it,
you know,

17
00:00:56.131 --> 00:00:59.340
the population of people that do it is not huge.

18
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.610
But I would say the vast majority of people who die skydiving,
they,

19
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.660
they kill themselves,
they make a poor decision.
Um,

20
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.440
and most people who die skydiving die under perfectly functioning equipment.

21
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.010
Really.
So the,
the canopy size,

22
00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:17.250
the main canopy that you're flying the wing over your head,
the smaller it is,

23
00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:20.610
the faster it goes,
the faster it descends.
But also quite frankly,

24
00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:24.300
the more fun it is.
But with fun there's consequence.

25
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.630
So they're our canopies that you can initiate a turn and if you initiate the

26
00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:34.410
turn too low,
you cannot pull the canopy out of the turn.

27
00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:37.590
You will impact the ground at a high rate of speed regardless of what you do.

28
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.770
And if you get under that canopy with not enough experience,

29
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.660
obviously your odds of making a bad decision,

30
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:46.110
you're going to go through the roof.
So most injuries and fatalities,

31
00:01:46.111 --> 00:01:47.460
at least from the stuff I've seen,

32
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:52.461
is from people making poor decisions under good equipment or choosing to execute

33
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.540
an emergency procedure,

34
00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:56.850
which would be cutting away your main parachute in deploying reserve,

35
00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.760
either out of sequence or doing it too low,

36
00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:01.860
or the reserve parachute doesn't have time to open.
To me,

37
00:02:01.861 --> 00:02:03.450
that's not a failure of the parachute system.

38
00:02:03.451 --> 00:02:06.750
That's the failure of the individual who is driving that parachute system.

39
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.070
So if you have a main parachute and you jump out and you hit the main parachute

40
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:14.670
and there's a malfunction,
how do you cut off to put,
to get the other one?

41
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.280
So there's two Pilus,
one on each side,
the right hand side.

42
00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:20.580
You literally need to do this in the correct order,

43
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.860
even though people have killed himself by going backwards.

44
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.870
So you pull to full arm extension you,

45
00:02:25.871 --> 00:02:29.430
it's literally just a pillow with velcro that has two cables and the cables are

46
00:02:29.431 --> 00:02:33.000
what's actually holding the parachute on your shoulders.
If you pull that out,

47
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.650
a three ring release system,

48
00:02:34.651 --> 00:02:38.580
which is basically just a load reduction system unwinds itself in,

49
00:02:38.581 --> 00:02:41.940
your parachute's gone and you're going back into free fall and you just pull the

50
00:02:41.941 --> 00:02:45.630
other pillow.
It sounds worse than it is.

51
00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:48.000
And before I had my first cut away,
it was terrifying.

52
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.630
And then after you have four or five,
you're like,
okay,
I got this,

53
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.780
had four or five main parachutes fail.
I think I'm at about seven.

54
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.420
Well,
I've been jumping for 20 years.
I want to hear that man.

55
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.330
I started jumping in 99.
Ah,
statistically I'm actually,
I think under,
uh,

56
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.110
I think it's like one in every 888 jumps,

57
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.200
you'll have the malfunction or a gear failure.
It's honestly like,

58
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:18.460
it's your first one is an emotional experience,
I would imagine you're saying.

59
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:20.650
What was the first one?
Uh,

60
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.580
deploying your parachute and just sitting there looking at it as it's because

61
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:26.830
they want to open and you can,

62
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.380
I can tell now within an instant of trying to deploy my parachute,

63
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.630
whether or not it's going to open or not,

64
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:36.280
just by looking at the shape by sometimes listening to it and just seeing how it

65
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:40.870
opens sometimes.
I mean,
so packing a parachute people think is really difficult.

66
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.430
If you can fold a tee shirt,
you can pack a parachute.
Sometimes though you,

67
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.821
you know,

68
00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:48.730
you just get off of the jump and you only have 10 minutes to make the next jump.

69
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.390
So you skip a few steps or you rush through a few steps.

70
00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:54.520
Is that what happened with you?
Potentially?

71
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.540
I may have skipped all of the non essential steps and a few of the essential

72
00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:00.550
steps to get the pair of shoes.
Really.

73
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.340
I was just rushing and I didn't have a lot of experience.

74
00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:06.430
So as stuff in the thing in there and when I tried to deploy the parachute,

75
00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:10.870
it just,
it was asymmetrical.
So sometimes it'll,

76
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.810
it'll open and it'll start spinning and then you're flying with your back to
the,

77
00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:16.750
it gets,
that would be considered an exciting moment,
I would say.

78
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.060
So what happened with you?
What exactly went wrong?

79
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.860
It just came out asymmetrically.

80
00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:23.860
The parachute wasn't opening and we have spinning.
No I wasn't.

81
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:26.770
I actually was able to recognize just by,
it should come out.

82
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.600
It looks like a rectangle more than anything.

83
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.650
But if you look like a rectangle with its twisted,
there's no way to fix that.

84
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.720
No Way.
So just get rid of it.
And that's what I did.

85
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:39.220
I looked up and I said okay that's not going to work.
Reach,

86
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.040
pull,
reach,
pull and your reserve open so fast.

87
00:04:42.041 --> 00:04:46.150
Like by the time I felt like by the time I had pulled the reserve handle,

88
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.540
cause I had a handle that point by the time I had moved my arm to three quarters

89
00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:53.290
of extension and it fired off.
Wow.
Yeah Dude.

90
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.870
But the difference,
and you were asking what the difference,

91
00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.370
like why is risk skydiving lower is because you have time,
thousands of feet.

92
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.290
Whereas base jumping,

93
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.920
you might have hundreds or if you're really pushing the envelope,

94
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.110
you might have sub 10 feet because you're flying close to the ground to sauce.

95
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.010
You can go did your friend Alex who died,

96
00:05:13.011 --> 00:05:15.430
did he died base jumping or he died wingsuit base jumping.

97
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.960
It's something that I was,
I mean he was my main base jumping partner.

98
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.020
What is the difference between wingsuit base jumping and regular base jump?

99
00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:26.230
Eight regular base jumping.
You just have a quick deploy parachute,
right?

100
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.770
So you have one parachute system when you base jump instead of two because there

101
00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:33.160
is not time for a reserve to open.
So that has just taken out of the system,

102
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.820
right?

103
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.710
So you pack your primary or only parachute very similar to a reserve.

104
00:05:38.711 --> 00:05:43.510
It's designed to open rapidly.
It's designed to take a lot of load.
Uh,

105
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.500
but so base jumping is just jumping off of aesthetic.

106
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.400
Object based stands for building antenna span or earth.
So four types of object.

107
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.200
The addition of the wing suit is really the only difference which allows you to,

108
00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.010
like myself personally,

109
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.360
I'm not a huge fan of jumping off buildings and cliffs without a wing seat

110
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:06.680
because I don't like being from me to that flag when a parachute opens because

111
00:06:06.681 --> 00:06:09.350
if it doesn't open exactly in the direction you want it to,

112
00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:11.870
you better be Johnny on the spot or you're going to have a fucking problem.

113
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.590
So it's to me if you have enough altitude,

114
00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:20.150
you put a wing suit on and two or three seconds,
the suit is mocking forward.

115
00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:22.880
So then your hundreds if not thousands of feet away from the object,

116
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.070
then your parish,
she can open up however you want it to.

117
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.710
Have they made any improvements in the technology or this stuff since you first

118
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:32.720
started jumping?
Huge improvements.

119
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.290
I mean the first wing suits were literally just fabric that had like the little

120
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:38.360
thumb loops you'll find on like cold weather,

121
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.680
long sleeve shirts sometimes seriously like Patrick [inaudible],
he kept it on.

122
00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.580
That's how they kept it on.
I didn't show up any of those goddamn things,

123
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.000
but I mean,
I think Patrick Day garden is how you say his name.

124
00:06:50.001 --> 00:06:52.370
He was one of the first and they would just sit there and just,

125
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.020
they would just jam their appendages and lock them out and use their entire

126
00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.400
musculature to sail this fabric as far out as they could get.

127
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.300
Fuck.
And then the suits now were unbelievable.
So each wing,

128
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.960
like the wing between your legs and the wing betweens,
each of your arms.

129
00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:11.480
So there's three of them.
They're totally independent.

130
00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:12.800
They have a ram air opening,

131
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.010
so the air rushes into that and makes the wings semi-rigid.

132
00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.280
So it reduces the stress on your body and they,

133
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.010
their flight characteristics are insane.
You can go,

134
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:27.140
you can get the suit flying faster,
you can fly it flat or you can float it.

135
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.320
Everything about it is improved except for the decision making process of the

136
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.780
monkey who is actually jumping in.
That's the original one,
Jamie.
Oh,

137
00:07:37.781 --> 00:07:38.890
that guy's dead for sure.

138
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:47.110
It says madness.
Mickey Morgan,

139
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.930
where he's 100% of that wing suit.
Is that ridiculous?
Well,

140
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.160
who was the first fucking psycho that thought that this was something that they

141
00:07:54.161 --> 00:07:58.000
should try?
It could potentially been,
oh my God,

142
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:59.223
this guy is like,

143
00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.170
he looks like he's living in the 18 hundreds when did they invent these fucking

144
00:08:02.171 --> 00:08:03.060
things?
I Dunno.

145
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.210
I know one of these guys died going off the Eiffel Tower in an exhibition.

146
00:08:06.211 --> 00:08:10.780
This is 1900 right here,
Tina hundred why in the fuck?

147
00:08:10.781 --> 00:08:14.020
Look at that guy strong.
You know what,
man,

148
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.360
if you were living in 1900 you'd probably be like,
listen,

149
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.160
let's just get this over with.
Fuck living in 1900 everyone has syphilis.

150
00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:25.310
Fucking whiskeys illegal.
I'm just jumping off.
Look at that.

151
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:30.100
That is crazy to see that.
I mean,
that's,
I mean,
honestly,
I'm not going to lie.

152
00:08:30.101 --> 00:08:34.090
It would probably jumped out of an airplane.
Teen 95 Oh,
he's the inventor.

153
00:08:34.091 --> 00:08:36.760
Earl Stein.
He died in the first attempt.

154
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.790
Oh Jesus Christ.

155
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.650
He died in the first attempt honor to a modern hero.
All right,
settle down.

156
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:45.700
But here's the thing,
Joe,

157
00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:50.840
there's like 60 some people who are associated with the modern day wingsuit and

158
00:08:50.841 --> 00:08:53.990
testing and evaluating to get it to this point.
They're all dead.

159
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:59.190
All of them are dead.
Every one of them.
She,
but that suit like,
I mean,

160
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.310
that suit and the difference between that and where we are now,

161
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:03.960
it's night and day,

162
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.560
but everyone involved in the creation of these wingsuits died in a wingsuit.

163
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:13.350
Yup.
Fuck man.
Yup.
That is not good.

164
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.280
Like it wouldn't be a whole lot of black belts in Jiu Jitsu.

165
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:20.520
Everyone who got to a certain point died.
You know what I'm saying?

166
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.100
It's hard to justify or rationalize the behavior for sure.

167
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:27.600
I'll be the first person to,
what is it?
Like what,

168
00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:30.760
what is it about jump?
But it's dog.
That's dean potter,

169
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.570
which helped him with his dog.
Oh,
the poor dog.
So the dog,
the dog's fault.

170
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.530
The dog I believe is that looks like Switzerland.
Crazy asshole fucking owner.

171
00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:43.390
So Dean was an insane,
right.
He's a world class rock climber.

172
00:09:43.391 --> 00:09:47.090
He's also dead from jumping wingsuit.
He died and Yosemite's.
Um,

173
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:51.840
it's like I said,
the technology advances,
uh,

174
00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.250
I am not,
I was not there the day the dean died.

175
00:09:54.251 --> 00:09:56.490
I've talked to people who've looked at it,
uh,

176
00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:00.250
as to the conditions that led up to it.
And,
uh,

177
00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:05.380
one thing people generally don't want to do is place the responsibility on the

178
00:10:05.381 --> 00:10:08.290
individual making the choice.
But what from everything that I have seen,

179
00:10:08.291 --> 00:10:11.070
he made a choice to jump at a time when he should not have been jumping due to

180
00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.320
visual conditions.
So even though the suits are amazing,

181
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:17.830
really the only thing that doesn't seem to be evolving as the person that's,

182
00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.740
that's jumping at it most of the time,
just like skydiving,

183
00:10:20.741 --> 00:10:24.790
it's just a human being making it very poor choice to include.
Alex.

184
00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.620
What is it about people,

185
00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:31.120
and I mean particularly people like yourself that love these thrills.

186
00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.150
Like what are you getting?
What are you getting out of the,

187
00:10:34.151 --> 00:10:38.620
other than this mad adrenaline rush?
I mean,
what is it like,

188
00:10:38.621 --> 00:10:40.360
what motivates you to keep doing that?

189
00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:42.493
<v 1>Uh,</v>

190
00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.280
<v 0>so I look back at it objectively.</v>

191
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.880
I think when I initially started pushing hard down that path,

192
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:57.170
I was trying to replicate a headspace or a feeling or a sensation that I had in

193
00:10:57.171 --> 00:10:58.004
my old job.

194
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.570
So if you want to talk about clarity of thought,

195
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:05.870
and I think we might've talked about this the very first time that we sat down,

196
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.100
stripping away all ancillary bullshit that has absolutely no meaning,

197
00:11:10.101 --> 00:11:11.870
but for me at least spend,

198
00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:15.260
I spend 99% of my time worrying about things that have no impact whatsoever,

199
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:17.300
right?
So He's sitting on a helicopter,

200
00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.420
did you pick the battle space that you're in and you,

201
00:11:19.421 --> 00:11:23.330
you get a five minute warning and you really stop worrying about whether or not

202
00:11:23.331 --> 00:11:26.090
you have enough money in your checking account to cover your mortgage.

203
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.020
And then you get a three minute warning and then you kind of stop worrying about

204
00:11:30.021 --> 00:11:33.020
whether or not you just had an argument with your wife or you just sent off some

205
00:11:33.021 --> 00:11:33.890
snarky email.

206
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:37.640
Then you get a one minute warning and a 32nd warning and the closer and closer

207
00:11:37.641 --> 00:11:40.310
and closer you get,
everything has gone.

208
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.220
And it is still to this day,
the,

209
00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:48.460
the sensation and state that I have been in that is by far I had no question

210
00:11:49.071 --> 00:11:49.904
about uh,

211
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:55.480
my purpose and I had the utmost clarity that I've ever experienced in my life.

212
00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:57.963
And you get,

213
00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:01.690
you get used to operating in that headspace of just being in the moment,

214
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.900
the first one to three seconds in front of you,
nothing else matters.

215
00:12:04.901 --> 00:12:07.990
I'm going to solve this problem and move on to the next one.
This problem,

216
00:12:07.991 --> 00:12:08.824
move on to the next one.

217
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:14.020
Well then I lost that ability to do that and it sucked because I liked operating

218
00:12:14.021 --> 00:12:15.240
in that headspace because it,

219
00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:19.060
it helped me deal with all the other bullshit in my life because it reset for
me.

220
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.250
My,
what matters and what doesn't matter.

221
00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.060
Ratio I was able to get rid of like I would describe it,

222
00:12:24.061 --> 00:12:25.960
it just the white noise in my head or go another way.

223
00:12:25.961 --> 00:12:30.040
I would describe it as like,
Jamie's got a bunch of levers that he can push up.

224
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:33.490
I think in this,
I'm included in this,

225
00:12:33.491 --> 00:12:36.070
I think most people are pegged out at a 10 almost all the time.

226
00:12:36.071 --> 00:12:38.290
They're fucking white knuckling through life.

227
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:43.090
But if you can get into that state where you have that clarity of purpose,

228
00:12:43.091 --> 00:12:44.080
clarity of focus.

229
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:49.350
I felt like it pulled everything back to a three and so that state helped me in

230
00:12:49.511 --> 00:12:53.170
things that had nothing to do with that activity and it lasted for a long time.

231
00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.550
So when your base jumping and you're standing on a cliff and you're scared out

232
00:12:57.551 --> 00:13:00.910
of your mind and you can't talk as your mouth is so dry and you have the p rang

233
00:13:00.911 --> 00:13:01.511
on your suit,

234
00:13:01.511 --> 00:13:05.620
which is why you always get dark suits so people can't see your peering ring and

235
00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.780
every alarm bell in your body is telling you don't jump.

236
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:13.470
And it had the same experience.
I wasn't worried about checking account,

237
00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:15.630
wasn't worried about what was going on in life.

238
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:20.660
I was just living in that moment and it helped me be a better dad.

239
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.970
It helped me be a better husband.

240
00:13:23.971 --> 00:13:27.330
It helped me be better at any business decision that I need to make because it

241
00:13:27.331 --> 00:13:28.200
allowed me to Paul,

242
00:13:28.201 --> 00:13:32.670
all of those stereo levers back down so it's less for me and I can only speak

243
00:13:32.671 --> 00:13:35.910
for me it's less about a thrill seeking cause I get that all the time.

244
00:13:35.911 --> 00:13:38.820
Like you're an adrenaline junkie.
I'm like Ah,
I enjoy,

245
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:40.650
I'm going to adrenaline enthusiast.

246
00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.700
I certainly enjoy that but I actually like what I get from the activity more

247
00:13:44.701 --> 00:13:45.840
than the activity itself.

248
00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:50.820
What do you think is going on where people are pegged at 10 all the time with

249
00:13:50.821 --> 00:13:54.660
nonsense and that's something that's life threatening can bring it back to a

250
00:13:54.661 --> 00:13:55.920
three and offer clarity.

251
00:13:55.921 --> 00:13:59.550
I mean the has to be something that you've discussed or thought about in depth.

252
00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:04.320
I just think it helps you
control alt,

253
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:07.440
delete your hard drive a little bit.

254
00:14:07.441 --> 00:14:11.640
It helps by not having,
like when I'm standing on a cliff,

255
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.320
right before I get ready to jump,

256
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:18.200
there is absolutely nothing that I am thinking about other than where I want to

257
00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:19.440
be in the next three seconds.

258
00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:25.110
And by being able to focus on something so singular,
and maybe I don't,

259
00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:26.040
I don't meditate,

260
00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:28.890
but I've heard people talking about it by a male to clear your mind.

261
00:14:28.891 --> 00:14:30.360
It helps them deal with everything else.

262
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:35.340
I think there might be some connection there.
Um,
but I just,
I just think that

263
00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:41.810
the removal of the noise that bombards everybody all day long,

264
00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:46.200
even for a little bit,
helps you.
It's,
uh,
you know,

265
00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:51.080
yet you have a iPod or not iPod,
iPhone and headset.
Headphones for sure.

266
00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.750
[inaudible] you ever noticed,
like when you're listening to it,

267
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:55.520
you listened at the same volume level,

268
00:14:55.521 --> 00:14:58.190
but then it just doesn't seem to be as loud.
So what do you do?

269
00:14:58.191 --> 00:14:59.600
You Click it up a notch,
right?

270
00:14:59.601 --> 00:15:02.180
And then you get used to that volume level and then you click it up a notch and

271
00:15:02.181 --> 00:15:05.120
then you get used to that volume load receptor downgrade phenomenon.

272
00:15:05.121 --> 00:15:06.950
Your body gets used to it,
so it adapts to it.

273
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:11.450
But if you pull that stimulus out and leave it at that high volume,

274
00:15:11.451 --> 00:15:13.940
but listened to it like two weeks later,
it's going to blow your ears out.

275
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:15.420
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

276
00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.060
<v 0>It'll seem loud.
It's not gonna blow your ears out,</v>

277
00:15:17.061 --> 00:15:19.760
but it's going to seem much louder than it would if you slowly just

278
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.210
incrementally started adding that volume.
So it's,

279
00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.580
there's something in there that is allowing me,

280
00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:29.570
and I'm not recommending that anybody pursue therapy via the directions that I

281
00:15:29.571 --> 00:15:32.870
do,
but there's something in there that's allowing me to,

282
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:37.350
instead of ad an ad,
an ad,
an ad,

283
00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:42.030
that activity allows me to detach.
And then when I come back to it,
I realize,

284
00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.860
you know,
it just,
it just feels different for me.

285
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.580
I don't know if that's a good description of the mechanism,

286
00:15:47.581 --> 00:15:49.500
but that's the best that I can probably describe it.
