1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.990
When did you start working as an EMT?
That was around the same time,
wasn't it?

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.700
Emt was about 12 summers ago for me.

3
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.180
I was turning 50 and I started going back to school for outdoor med response,

4
00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:17.780
camping,
climbing and what,

5
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.600
what is it like when you go to one of those classes and they realize who you
are?

6
00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:23.010
How weird is it kid?
Ah,

7
00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:27.690
sometimes you can get a little bit uptight because I'm the oldest guy in the

8
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:30.770
room.
Okay.
Right.
And I want to clarify something.
Okay.

9
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.520
When I became an EMT shield number three,
two seven,

10
00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:37.650
four 66 47th precinct,

11
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.160
big shout out to all of you who taught me and tolerated me until I became an EMT

12
00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:46.200
and put on that uniform.
I wasn't somebody,

13
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.620
somebody cleaned the fucking truck up

14
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.530
until I put on that uniform.
Joe,
after training for how many months?

15
00:00:58.531 --> 00:01:02.250
It's almost a year for me like this.
I wasn't someone,

16
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.800
someone clean up the track

17
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.430
and that was my job starting right off.
But,
uh,

18
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.010
I was also the somebody who dragged the oxygen box all 13 floors up in the

19
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.160
didn't walled projects should artists to artists.

20
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.370
How many times have you driven past something,

21
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.590
whether it's a huge building or a teepee,
I wonder what's in there.

22
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.410
Mm.
And then you go into them,
I wonder what's in the frigerator.

23
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.630
I wonder what they listened to in there and I wonder who the they are.

24
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.460
I have a fascination for that.
Mm.

25
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.790
My pop had a big sprawling I think.

26
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.780
Is it simply empathy for people?
You know,

27
00:01:49.781 --> 00:01:54.760
when the fellows started getting age in the early eighties he started treating

28
00:01:54.761 --> 00:01:59.590
him.
He's an eye surgeon and everybody,
my sisters and stuff started saying,

29
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.640
but this is a time when you think you can catch that shift from breathing it pop

30
00:02:03.641 --> 00:02:05.980
and whatever.
And he turned to me,
I'll never forget,
he said,

31
00:02:05.981 --> 00:02:10.380
I don't get to choose my patients.
Wow.

32
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.850
I don't get to choose my audience.

33
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.600
So what was the motivation to start doing that though?
We'll see what's in there.

34
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.830
Where is your rater Joe?

35
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.400
And you'll walk in first cause you're way stronger than me in case there's

36
00:02:22.401 --> 00:02:27.110
trouble and you'll go and be on lunch and in case somebody comes at us,

37
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.003
you handle it.

38
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.133
Oh,
I had a,

39
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.140
I had a mentor named Kesha who had to pile or dread locks up so high that it was

40
00:02:39.051 --> 00:02:42.350
as long as from her shoulders to the top of her head,
her haircut,

41
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.720
it was like she had cheered.

42
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.970
She put her hand up on top and Kesha walked in that door.
First Homie,

43
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.630
domestic disputes.
She dealt with the guys.

44
00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:58.550
You had to be there for domestics as we.
Yeah.
Oh those are those.
Gary is a very,

45
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.640
and get an eye on your audience.

46
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Stops being audience starts being the neighborhood and pretty soon you live in

47
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.940
the neighborhood.

48
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.010
I was under the train once in the Fulton Street station talking to a homeless

49
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:19.660
valid quick briefing.
Act like nothing's wrong.
See if I can get them to come out.

50
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.103
<v 2>Hi,</v>

51
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.940
<v 0>you're hungry.
Train breathes.
Okay.</v>

52
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.790
Subway obtained breeze.
It doesn't just sit there silently

53
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.450
and you got to go real.
Geez,

54
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.970
I'm laughing now,
but that's a nervous laugh.

55
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.960
And now every one of those folks is in my voice when I sing.
Whoo.

56
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.600
I liked that.
I liked that thought process.

57
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.350
When you decided to do this,
was this a conscience,

58
00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.120
a conscious effort to try to just enrich your experiences?

59
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.640
Cross training,
cross training.

60
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.440
I'll give it to quick rationale and I also know it's going to change me.

61
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.650
Don't know how,
but she got to get in it.

62
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.650
And after a certain point in your life,

63
00:04:13.651 --> 00:04:18.651
maybe a go where there is no shallow and challenge yourself as just as I move

64
00:04:20.411 --> 00:04:24.470
somewhere.
That's a foreign language as you can't even read the street signs,
uh,

65
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.770
in Japan for example.
Um,
but you know,

66
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.440
you start off on the bunny slopes.
You don't serve 40 footers.
Righto.

67
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.140
At first you got to move to New York and go through that whole thing of what

68
00:04:37.141 --> 00:04:40.320
have I done?
But what's the,
so what's the thought process when you like,

69
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.120
I'm going to be an EMT,
I'm going to study for a year.
I'm on a train,

70
00:04:43.121 --> 00:04:47.870
I'm going to go out there and I'm gonna actually do it.
I okay.

71
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.160
Sometimes when I go for a walk in the city,

72
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.300
my plan is to just follow where the sun is beaming.

73
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.930
I get to an intersection,
the sun is on that far corner.

74
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.340
I'll cross over to that and then I'll look down the block and see where the sun

75
00:05:02.341 --> 00:05:05.790
is and I walked down the block and get into that part and just do a lot of this

76
00:05:05.791 --> 00:05:10.650
by yourself.
Oh yeah.
I did the same thing with EMT training.

77
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.100
Jeez.
My Dad was a doctor.

78
00:05:14.101 --> 00:05:17.550
The first aid merit badge I got as a boy scout was first aid.

79
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.560
I was that guy and I learned that for skinny guy like me.

80
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.670
Real power probably came from being cool when everybody else is going.

81
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.640
Yeah.
Cause my dad had to do that.

82
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.160
I assisted him in surgeries at a very early age.
Oh yeah.

83
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.660
And you know and stuff that made everybody else I this pocket.

84
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.960
I have a good ambulance voice.
You want to hear it?
Let me do that.
Okay.

85
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Hold on again.
You're going to be just fine.

86
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.790
Can you imagine,
you know,
being in an ambulance,

87
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.030
you look up and it's motherfucking David Lee Roth telling you you're going to be

88
00:05:55.031 --> 00:05:57.290
okay.
He'd be like,
Oh,
I'm dead.
I must be dead.

89
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.450
I only twice has that actually happened cause I only worked in the hood.

90
00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.500
I only worked around it at night.
I only worked,
she,
you know,

91
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.560
you would never expect to see me once was after Oz fest football stadium.

92
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.810
Yeah.
Unfortunate was uh,
you know,
uh,

93
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.440
drank too much or whatever and he was out of sorts and you know,

94
00:06:21.441 --> 00:06:22.131
sitting in a corner,

95
00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:27.131
somebody phoned him in from the local liquor store and you could see that

96
00:06:27.201 --> 00:06:30.940
disbelief in his face,
you know,
and I leaned over and said to him,
Hey,

97
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.210
you're going to be just fine.

98
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.540
Like this is like the lyrics of an Ozzy song come to life,

99
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.030
you know?
But beyond that,
no,

100
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.180
nobody ever really did.
And uh,
you know,
Jesus,

101
00:06:47.181 --> 00:06:48.800
I weighed 15 more pounds.

102
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.540
I was doing the Arnold routine at the wage stack because I was somebody,

103
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.730
well,
somebody help me lift this
my fourth day.

104
00:06:58.731 --> 00:06:59.060
I'm not,

105
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.800
I'm them not a pretentious about what my fourth days work.

106
00:07:03.801 --> 00:07:07.100
So you bulked up for the job?
Oh yeah.
And a,

107
00:07:07.101 --> 00:07:11.030
I wait 15 more pounds and I lifted man,

108
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.470
I could lift.
I lifted people out of bathtubs.
I lifted him out of the ocean,

109
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.680
I lifted him out of the projects,
I lifted him out of the truck,

110
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.500
I lifted him into the other truck cause the first truck just broke down in the

111
00:07:21.501 --> 00:07:26.180
snow.
I live
and uh,
just do this for all.

112
00:07:26.181 --> 00:07:27.530
Sorry.
How long did you do this for?

113
00:07:27.531 --> 00:07:31.690
I research did once about four and a half summers.
Four and a half years.
Okay.

114
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:36.470
And I,
you know,
in between,
uh,
uh,
playing and whatever,

115
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.190
and again,
a big shout out to all my teachers and mentors,
not a day goes by.

116
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:44.620
I don't think about it.
And not a day goes by that,
uh,

117
00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.740
I don't use some skill including that,
you know,

118
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:53.810
that'll level your head a little bit.
Yeah.
Somebody go make some coffee,

119
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.673
Joel.

120
00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.800
So you feel like for a guy like you who was such a gigantic superstar and you

121
00:08:00.801 --> 00:08:04.400
just touring these huge arenas and people were freaking out every time they see

122
00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:09.350
you,
for you,
it was,
um,
maybe a good way to balance things out too,

123
00:08:09.351 --> 00:08:14.351
because you're seeing people in a life or death situation and dire straits when

124
00:08:14.481 --> 00:08:19.400
they're unhealthy and they need help and you're out there in the down and dirty

125
00:08:19.401 --> 00:08:23.300
and the nitty gritty,
like,
you know,
like you said,
trucks breaking down,

126
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.290
picking people up out of the bathtubs.
Well,

127
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:29.900
a lot of what you just described is the first response team.
Yes.

128
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:34.790
We always describe our patients,
our friends and clients.

129
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39.590
Okay.
But the struggle for our,

130
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:43.670
I'll call it the uniform,
starts with military police,

131
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:48.700
fire first response I'll throw in nursing or emergency room,

132
00:08:48.831 --> 00:08:50.720
and those of us with bells and whistles,

133
00:08:50.721 --> 00:08:54.780
who she called the ambulance and et Cetera.

134
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.620
You see that from the inside out.
Yeah.

135
00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:01.340
And that really will sharpen your vision.
