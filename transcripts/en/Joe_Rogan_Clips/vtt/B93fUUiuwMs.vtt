00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.860
You know what,
like kind of like Jamie said,
it's dangerous in a lot of ways.

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.090
It's dangerous to control people's thoughts and behavior because who are you to

3
00:00:09.091 --> 00:00:10.790
say and when does it end?
You know,

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.470
it just keeps going and going and going and going.
It gets,

5
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.060
it gets very slippery when you have one group that thinks it's right and they're

6
00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:22.820
trying to control another group that thinks they're right.
Man,
that is a,

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.400
it's,

8
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.050
it seems so simple when you're just talking about dead naming transgender people

9
00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:32.310
or not degrading people based on their looks or their ethnicity or their this or

10
00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:33.144
their that.

11
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.330
But what you're doing is you're trying to dictate how humans communicate with

12
00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:38.220
each other and people don't like it when you tell him what to do.

13
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.340
The problem with telling people what to do is they want to do the exact
opposite.

14
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.240
This is one of the first things you realize when you have kids like,
oh,

15
00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:47.040
they don't want to listen to me.
Like,

16
00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:49.920
I got to figure out a way to sneak information into them,
you know,

17
00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:53.850
or you gotta you gotta figure out a way to not be too bossy.

18
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.860
People don't want someone telling them what to do.

19
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.200
This is what I missed when I was edited,
headed into that conversation.

20
00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:04.800
I missed how other people looked at that guy and what he stands for.

21
00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:08.310
I don't think it's correct.
I think it's way more complicated.

22
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.850
I think it's an insane business to run it.
No,

23
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.480
I don't think he really knew why Alex Jones was banned or what anybody else has

24
00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:16.620
been.
I don't think he really knew.

25
00:01:16.621 --> 00:01:21.621
I think he's dealing with a giant corporation and he's a young guy and he wears

26
00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:26.790
sandals.
Like come by here on,
wait,
wait,
what kind of Sandoz?
There's a weird ones.

27
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.680
Nice guy.
Like leaning on Bro.
Let's just choose.

28
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.410
He runs a couple of different companies.
He's not,

29
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.740
he's not sitting at Twitter offices.

30
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.880
That's another thing that Alex Jones brought up today that uh,

31
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.680
he sponsors the podcast through the,
the cash app,
which is also,

32
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.680
he also runs so 100% true.
But I would have,

33
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.780
and I think we talked about it on the podcast,

34
00:01:45.781 --> 00:01:49.170
we even talked about the cash app being a sponsor and about how it's helped

35
00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:50.880
Justin wren is fight for the forgotten charity.

36
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.470
So Alex Jones or ruinously said that I didn't mention it so we did mention it.

37
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.770
It's worth mentioning and Alex Jones is a,

38
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.210
he having to like respond to people that want to know if I've seen what Alex

39
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.780
Jones is said about me lately is one of the weird things that I've dealt with

40
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.300
because first of all I've always had good dealings with Alex in person,

41
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.480
person to person,
but he's obviously in a world of shit right now.

42
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.160
There's a lot going on with him with the sandy hook stuff and he wasn't entirely

43
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.050
honest with me about what he had said about Sandy Hook.
Maybe he didn't remember.

44
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.330
Maybe he was trying to phrase it in a way other than the way I interpreted it

45
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:37.260
when I saw the videos,

46
00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:40.500
but there's a media matters video that shows all the time where he said that

47
00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:43.920
Sandy Hook was fake.
This is a very complicated,
to me,

48
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.190
this is one of the reasons why I struggled with bringing him back on the
podcast.

49
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.900
That's very complicated.

50
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.670
It's that is even though,
um,

51
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.200
I've known the guy since 1998 and if I'm around him,

52
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.570
I'd say that's my friend Alex Jones.
He's a friend.
He's off.

53
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.730
He obviously did something fucked up and the parents that had to deal with what

54
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:11.200
he did,
there's parents that had to deal with people calling them a crisis actor.

55
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.890
They had to deal with people harassing them at the courthouse and harassing them

56
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.970
if they met them in public because they were saying that they were lying about

57
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:24.010
their kids being killed.
So not only the kids being killed,

58
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:28.630
but they have to deal with someone harassing them and saying,

59
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:31.000
you're a liar and you're enactor.
It's insanity.

60
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.980
And I wouldn't,
I would think about it differently.

61
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.130
I've definitely think about differently if I wasn't friends with Alex,

62
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.700
but it would also think about it differently if he hadn't made shit up about me.

63
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.900
He said that I was told to stop talking about conspiracies or they threaten my

64
00:03:48.911 --> 00:03:52.900
family.
That's a hundred percent horseshit and he has my phone number.

65
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.860
He could have called me.
I called him after I heard about it.

66
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.100
He told me that someone told him that I talked,

67
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:03.100
I talked to the person who told him that I'm like,
this is fucking bananas.

68
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.040
Like you out of your mind,
call me.
This is so stupid.

69
00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:09.760
You think I'm not talking about whatever.
Fill in the blank.
Whatever.

70
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:14.740
Ridiculous conspiracy,
the Rothschilds,
the fucking Rockefeller's,
whatever it is.

71
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.260
I'm not talking about that because the government threatened my family.

72
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:21.790
That is fucking wrong.
It's ridiculous.
And now you've put it out there.

73
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.950
So Alex Jones went on afterwards and he apologized and corrected it.

74
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.740
Then recently,
because I haven't had them on the podcast,

75
00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:34.140
he decided to start saying that I worked for the CIA and then um,
uh,

76
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.610
George Soros talking points,

77
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.690
which I don't even know what he's fucking talking points our talking points

78
00:04:40.691 --> 00:04:45.580
about him and specific not talking to anybody.
No one's giving me talking points,

79
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.390
not George Soros.
That's not what Eddie Bravo has been saying.
He got it.

80
00:04:49.391 --> 00:04:53.680
He got good.
He got good information through even say that.
So stop.

81
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.180
Joey Diaz did fuck with Eddie for awhile though.
But,
but the point being,

82
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.420
the point being Alex is you're out there.

83
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.070
I still like you as a person.
If I saw you,
I'd still give you a hug,

84
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.570
but you're making shit up and this is,
this is not helping.

85
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.070
Anybody wants to defend you.
It's not helping me as a person.

86
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.790
Talk about the good qualities in you and you know the,

87
00:05:18.791 --> 00:05:20.890
these things that you're saying are made up.

88
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.410
You're making up the fact that I'm in the CIA.

89
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.670
You're making up for the fact that the Hollywood insiders have given me

90
00:05:27.671 --> 00:05:30.940
information and tell me what to say.
That's not true.
You know,
it's not true.

91
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.840
You know me,
I don't have time to be a CIA insider.

92
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.820
I can't take on another job in between doing standup and podcasts and UFC

93
00:05:39.821 --> 00:05:44.770
commentator running a family.
I can't do it.
I wouldn't do it.

94
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.420
I'm not interested.

95
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.950
I'd rather stop doing everything then work for any government organization.

96
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.480
No one's ever approached me.
No one's ever approached anybody I've ever heard of.

97
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.640
I don't even know if that really happens.
I don't know if that's real thing.

98
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.930
The thing is they will say is that the CIA would talk to the people in Hollywood

99
00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:07.640
and tell them what to say in terms of propaganda and maybe,
I don't know.

100
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.260
I don't have any personal knowledge of it.

101
00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:13.490
I'm sure someone has decided that if they're going to make a movie about like

102
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.790
zero dark 30 that they have to get some sort of approval and I'm sure that a lot

103
00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:22.080
of movies that are very inspirational that I have to do with the military,

104
00:06:22.081 --> 00:06:25.130
it would be great for recruitment.
So I'm sure there's some involvement.

105
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.230
I'm sure there's also some patriots that work in show business that want to put

106
00:06:30.231 --> 00:06:35.231
out these movies about the government and about the military and a very positive

107
00:06:35.631 --> 00:06:38.600
way.
That's probably the case in some instances too,

108
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.450
but not everything's a fucking conspiracy and this is why it's stupid in white

109
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.570
stupid is some things are fucking conspiracy and Alex Jones has talked about

110
00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:52.520
some things that were real conspiracies.
That nine 11 documentary,

111
00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:53.900
the road to tyranny details,

112
00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:58.901
the World Trade Organization protests where they sent in these agent

113
00:06:59.601 --> 00:07:02.270
provocateurs,
the,
which are essentially soldiers.

114
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:06.890
They send in soldiers and military people dressed up in all black and cover

115
00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:10.520
their face and they smashed windows and tip over things and they take a peaceful

116
00:07:10.521 --> 00:07:14.330
protest and they turn it violent so then the police can move in and shut down

117
00:07:14.331 --> 00:07:16.730
the protest.
And then not only did they do that,

118
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.270
but they made a no protest zone and the United States of America,
uh,

119
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:21.590
no protest zone.

120
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.430
Was it the United States of America wasn't Vancouver was it was Seattle I think.

121
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:26.750
No,

122
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:31.610
I think at Seattle World Trade Organization protests with the boots and they all

123
00:07:31.611 --> 00:07:33.680
have the same shoes.
Yeah,
that shit.

124
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.860
But Alex detailed this in detail and it was real when he makes things up.

125
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.170
Like there was one recently,

126
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:47.000
the David Pakman show had on about a Alex talking about people eating babies

127
00:07:47.001 --> 00:07:51.620
pituitary glands and scattered vandalism of downtown Seattle.
Yeah,
Seattle.
See,

128
00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:56.570
so the enforcement,
no protest zone.
That was in 2009 in 1999 rather

129
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.640
was it [inaudible] 99 yeah,
December 1st,

130
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:06.210
1999 the October 27 2009 was the article.
Um,

131
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:08.090
yeah,
Alex did that.
That was real.

132
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:12.290
That was legit and it was very informative because I didn't know that that is

133
00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:14.000
how the government operated sometimes.

134
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.930
Did you contact him the second time and go talk to him?

135
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.520
I sent him a text message,
so this is why I won't talk to you.

136
00:08:19.521 --> 00:08:21.350
You say crazy stupid shit like this,

137
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:25.430
but I don't hate the guy.
He's,
you know,

138
00:08:25.431 --> 00:08:29.030
he'll scream and yell and call me a demon.
He's not a good place.

139
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.420
You're not in a good place when you're defending against that and what all these

140
00:08:32.421 --> 00:08:36.020
other conspiracies like it's all fun and games until you're talking about

141
00:08:36.021 --> 00:08:38.900
people's kids getting murdered and then all of a sudden people are like,

142
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.810
fuck you.
And that's basically what happened with him.

143
00:08:41.811 --> 00:08:46.730
If he was just ranting about government conspiracies or you know,

144
00:08:46.731 --> 00:08:50.030
who shot this guy or who's stealing money from here.

145
00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:54.680
Some of what he talks about is beneficial,
but Alex is not,

146
00:08:54.681 --> 00:08:56.130
I don't think in a good place.

147
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.050
I don't think he's in a good place mentally and I don't,

148
00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:01.620
I don't think he's in a good place in terms of his situation with the law.

149
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.970
I don't hate you Alex Jones.
If you listen to this,
if I saw you,

150
00:09:05.971 --> 00:09:06.900
I'd still give you a hug.

151
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.380
I'll still even do your fucking show when I come to Austin.
I don't care.
You can,

152
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.950
we can come and hang out,
but just stop making shit up.
It's silly.

153
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.460
And you know,

154
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.520
I'm sorry if there's bad stuff between us a more sorry of what you said about

155
00:09:22.681 --> 00:09:26.580
those kids.
I'm sorry about everything.
Um,
it's,
it's unfortunate.

156
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:31.140
It's all terrible now.
Something like that.

157
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.530
What's the road to redemption for someone like that?
Cause some,

158
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:36.030
this is the thing about people is,

159
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.190
and I think this is also what's going on with Alex.

160
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:42.930
People need a road to redemption.
Like if,

161
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:46.440
if someone fucks up horribly and does something terrible,

162
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:52.230
should that be the end of them?
This idea that we don't need them anymore,

163
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.220
no matter who it is.
I mean what,

164
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.750
what does a person have to do to grow and learn and for,

165
00:09:59.751 --> 00:10:04.530
for people just accept them again and let them on to all platforms again.
What,

166
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.520
what,
what does a person have to do?
It's a real good question.

167
00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:10.400
<v 1>I think it's per person now.</v>

168
00:10:10.401 --> 00:10:12.950
Like somebody like Alex to seems like he's getting worse and worse.

169
00:10:12.951 --> 00:10:15.200
Like this seems like what he did teach us.

170
00:10:15.201 --> 00:10:19.130
You is just doing it to me cause it's mad at me cause I haven't had him on that.

171
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.910
He,
I'm sure he asked you or if he was in town,
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:26.530
<v 0>No,
no.
Do you not listening?
I said I didn't want to have him on one.</v>

173
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.600
I was trying to figure out whether I would have in mind but when I watched the

174
00:10:29.601 --> 00:10:33.210
media matters video it was very clear to me he wasn't being on.

175
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:38.240
I asked him if he had said that it was fake and he said he questioned whether or

176
00:10:38.301 --> 00:10:42.140
not it was real.
But then eventually he acknowledged that it was real,

177
00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:46.580
which he has done.
But there was many times where he said it was fake.
Not One,

178
00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:49.520
many times.
It's absolutely fake.
It was a hundred percent fake.

179
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.990
There's video of it.
I didn't see the video before we did our nine 11 podcast.

180
00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.860
I've seen it now and I still thought about having a model.

181
00:10:57.861 --> 00:11:01.250
It's still thought about talking to them about it and talking to him about all

182
00:11:01.251 --> 00:11:02.450
this shit and what it's like.

183
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:07.830
<v 1>I think it's,
he plays a character.
Honestly.
I don't think so.</v>

184
00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:11.640
I mean their rep tiled guys and people and the things that he says,
none of it.

185
00:11:11.641 --> 00:11:14.600
Half of it's just like,
what the fuck are you talking about?
I think he,

186
00:11:14.601 --> 00:11:16.830
he definitely goes,
goes crazy with

187
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.210
<v 0>things,
but I don't think he's doing well.
Um,</v>

188
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.490
but he was talking about eating babies pituitary glands.

189
00:11:23.491 --> 00:11:28.060
Where at Cvu find that David Pakman video.
David Pakman who's a progressive,

190
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.280
a commentator online.
He,
he was going,
look,

191
00:11:32.281 --> 00:11:35.190
something's wrong with him.
Like he's playing this video,

192
00:11:35.191 --> 00:11:37.950
like what he's talking about them breaking into more

193
00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:39.580
<v 1>what is happening in the Alex Jones.
Yeah.</v>

194
00:11:39.581 --> 00:11:43.340
See if you can find the part on the video where Alex is talking.
It's early on.

195
00:11:43.341 --> 00:11:44.530
It sounds like schizophrenia.

196
00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.740
It sounds like any episode of the live PD or a cops,
you know,

197
00:11:47.741 --> 00:11:52.050
and people are talking like,
I saw aliens upstairs in my house,
you know,

198
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:54.340
like the guy,
I wouldn't Benjamin

199
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.710
<v 0>look at him,
he played this place real quick.
Okay.</v>

200
00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.410
<v 2>It's all in plain view of these people.</v>

201
00:11:58.411 --> 00:12:03.090
They're just put it in our face and they want a system where we can't do

202
00:12:03.091 --> 00:12:05.890
anything to stop them.
That's like a Domar.

203
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:08.850
And the name of his production company is Sha kid love,

204
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:12.330
which is isn't Apple's slogan.
Basically,

205
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.160
they may shows about having sex with kids all the time and says it's okay to

206
00:12:17.161 --> 00:12:18.030
have sex with,
you know,

207
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:23.220
kids that have section 35 year olds from the 12 just incredibly outrageous,
evil,

208
00:12:23.221 --> 00:12:25.740
pathetic stuff of these solace demons

209
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:31.680
like Bill Maher.
But,
uh,
Josh was saying he had a theory,

210
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.000
the only one what?
Walnut sausage,

211
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:40.020
and I know you would say it's the pituitary gland because they confirmed the

212
00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:43.670
Jimmy Chevelle and others would a torsional kids to death.

213
00:12:43.671 --> 00:12:45.300
But I think because we get regular wants to kill,

214
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.600
if everything was to grab a kid,
run over more the cars,
they could say,
oh,

215
00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:49.950
there's a police report.
They get run over.

216
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.340
But they would hurry to the morgue and they work with different,

217
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.730
different governor controlled morgues and eat the pituitary gland as quickly as

218
00:12:56.731 --> 00:13:00.060
possible,
uh,
and,
and,
and get high off of it.
So yes.

219
00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:05.030
<v 0>Yeah.
Okay.
That's,
yeah,</v>

220
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:10.520
that's first of all,
Bill Maher has done a fucking pedophile.
This,
this is crazy.

221
00:13:10.521 --> 00:13:12.290
This is like a weird rambling,

222
00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.700
and this is not Alex that I knew from 1998.
It's just not,

223
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:20.450
it's not the same guy.
This guy not doing well.

224
00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:26.660
So my apology,
um,
as a human being to Alex Jones,
if,

225
00:13:26.661 --> 00:13:29.000
uh,
you were hurt that I didn't have you back on the show.

226
00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.480
If you are hurt that I've occasionally poke fun at you,
I have to.

227
00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:36.950
You're hilarious unfortunately.
But,
uh,
I don't hate you.

228
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:41.480
Don't wish you wish you badly.
And,
uh,
back in the day I enjoyed it.

229
00:13:41.481 --> 00:13:45.110
A lot of your stuff,
people lose their way,
you know?

230
00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.640
So
I think that,
um,

231
00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:54.320
it's a real bad feeling being stuck on the outside too.

232
00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:59.630
When they all band together and kick you out and everybody kicks you out.

233
00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:01.310
Everybody,
Twitter,

234
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:06.260
Facebook and everybody and Youtube and Twitter was the last one.
But,
uh,

235
00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:10.850
that was Jack Dorsey didn't even know why l Sean's got kicked off Twitter and

236
00:14:10.851 --> 00:14:13.070
people are like,
well,
let them back in then.
Like,
yeah,

237
00:14:13.071 --> 00:14:15.560
but somebody knows like somebody,
like,

238
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:20.300
I don't think Jack Dorsey is really the guy who's looking at each individual

239
00:14:20.301 --> 00:14:21.530
person that gets banned.

240
00:14:21.531 --> 00:14:25.400
I just have a feeling that that stuff is compartmentalized.
Right.

241
00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:29.450
I felt he thinks it's about the people hunting for 7 million monthly active

242
00:14:29.451 --> 00:14:33.110
users on there.
Right.
But how many people are,
um,

243
00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.740
responsible for banning people and real high profile people?

244
00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:41.000
I'm sure there's a whole,
like maybe 12 people.
They have to have a meeting.

245
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:44.510
Then they,
you know,
maybe they talked to Jack.
Maybe they don't,
maybe they,

246
00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:48.500
it's an opposition who,
yeah.
Right.
And he may be,
he doesn't,
we don't know.

247
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:49.730
I'll ask that for sure.

248
00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.670
But maybe he didn't know when people got banned until he liked maybe got a

249
00:14:52.671 --> 00:14:56.690
company memo.
Maybe he wasn't involved in the,
of course,
maybe.
I don't know.

250
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.350
Maybe he's the one that calls him up and said,
get rid of this motherfucker.

251
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:01.430
That's possible too.
