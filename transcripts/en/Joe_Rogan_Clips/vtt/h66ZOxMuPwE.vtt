WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.530
See you man.
Good to see you.

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.620
I purposely didn't ask you or talk to you about the grizzly bear attack cause I

3
00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:11.610
wanted to save it.
You want it,
you want,

4
00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:16.611
what is it like to have survived but literally being two feet away from an

5
00:00:18.741 --> 00:00:23.400
attack and grizzly close if you could have grabbed it.
Yeah.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
Easily.

6
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.960
Easily.
Oh it was,
that was just nuts.
It was one of those things.

7
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.760
Okay.
I've thought about it a million times.
I'm sure.
How long ago was this?

8
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.350
This was,
so that would have been early October or mid October.

9
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.310
So you've had two or three months.
Three months to California.
Yep.
And uh,

10
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.801
yeah man,

11
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:48.360
it's just one of those things that I've thought about it so many times in my

12
00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:51.750
head and I've always been,
I think Steve was the same way.
Like,
oh,

13
00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:55.320
it'd be pretty cool to,
uh,
survive a bear attack.

14
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.850
Get scratched up a little bit after that experience.
I thought to myself,

15
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.180
if that never happens,
you know me.
Okay.
Yeah.
Steve,
you so always say Steve or no,

16
00:01:04.181 --> 00:01:07.860
we're talking about from the immediate or podcasts and he has a two part series

17
00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:10.860
on this particular bear attack,

18
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.480
but he always say he wanted to get clawed across the chest and have like not a

19
00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:17.170
tattoo,
but like a big cough.

20
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.810
Get a marking like w what are the odds that that happens?
Yeah,

21
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.780
I think that in order to get that you have to go through a really,

22
00:01:24.781 --> 00:01:29.781
really horrible experience and there's guys that have had those attacks or

23
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.700
there's guys that have had those detects a lot.
But yeah,

24
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.790
I mean I've been around a lot of wild animals and seen a lot of things and been

25
00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:42.660
charged by bears and this was just different.

26
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.530
It was that kind of attack where while it's happening,
you're going,

27
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.110
this is not gonna Pan out.
Well,

28
00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:53.700
somebody is going to die something either you're just looking at this bear and

29
00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:57.900
it's coming in hot and just everything.
It's a weird experience.
You don't,

30
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.050
your memory's a little foggy of it and everything happened so fast,

31
00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:05.360
but it felt like it was so long.
So the adrenaline must have overwhelming.

32
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.790
Yeah.
And you don't even think about,

33
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.480
I just remember it was,
it was a weird situation.

34
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.250
So maybe I'll just kind of recap the story.
Um,
so we're,

35
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.970
we're on a fog neck island and we're hunting in a fog.

36
00:02:20.971 --> 00:02:23.040
Mac Island is off a Kodiak.
Yeah.

37
00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:26.130
So a fog neck island has some of the largest bears in the world.

38
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.940
They're brown bears there.

39
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.470
They are big brown bears and it can be over a thousand pounds.

40
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.230
So we're hunting elk there.

41
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.950
My brother and myself have hunted elk on that island before and it's just a

42
00:02:40.921 --> 00:02:42.330
miserable place to be.

43
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.930
What's a fascinating hunt the way you guys were describing it,
because the,
the,

44
00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:49.200
just the fact that you would choose out of all the places you can go,

45
00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:50.870
you pretty much can go anywhere you want.
Yeah.

46
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
You chose to go on this brutal adventure hunt because it's so difficult once is

47
00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.540
it?

48
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.510
Because like Rinella was talking about this once and the way he described it as

49
00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:04.960
like,
there's things that are fun while you're doing them,

50
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.320
but they're not fun later.
Like rollercoasters.
Yeah.

51
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.110
And then there's things that are terrible and awful,

52
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.710
but you'll think about them forever and look back at them fondly.
Yeah,

53
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:18.160
that's exactly what this is,
is that,
uh,
after the fact,

54
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.100
you think back and you get them in the moment,
you go,
I will never do this again.

55
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.970
And then about a year later,
yeah,
we should do that again.
It's weird.

56
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.260
And what is it about the place it's so miserable?
Well,
it's just,

57
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.390
it's hard to walk through it.
It looks,

58
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.590
it looks easy hiking and there's just this big mountain where you can get to

59
00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:37.251
with a plane,

60
00:03:37.251 --> 00:03:42.251
you've kind of got to climb this big mountain and the vegetation is so thick and

61
00:03:42.561 --> 00:03:47.270
it's so steep that it takes forever to go somewhere.
So to put it in perspective,

62
00:03:47.271 --> 00:03:52.170
to go say a mile might take five hours.
Whoa.
That's how much vertical,

63
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:53.660
like a map mile.

64
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.280
So the way the crow would fly if you're just going a mile and then another

65
00:03:58.281 --> 00:04:01.130
distance could take you half that time or a quarter of that time.

66
00:04:01.131 --> 00:04:06.131
But there's a big mountain in between where you need to go plus the vegetation.

67
00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.880
And it's really steep.
So you've got all that kind of working against you.

68
00:04:10.881 --> 00:04:13.130
Plus you can't really walk and just a straight line there.

69
00:04:13.131 --> 00:04:15.560
You've got to navigate around all kinds of,

70
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.200
definitely as you from play some of this Jamie,

71
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.960
that was z droid and

72
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.290
rough gay.

73
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.650
So that was after the bear attack.
Well,
I'll have to figure out,

74
00:04:31.651 --> 00:04:33.970
cause I pope right after the bear attacked,

75
00:04:33.971 --> 00:04:37.240
I pulled out my phone and it was just kind of like recording everyone's

76
00:04:37.241 --> 00:04:41.080
reactions and then I put it on my Instagram story,
but I'll,

77
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.080
I'll try to find it tonight and I'll post it on to some,

78
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.520
I'll figure out a way to,
yeah,
it's instigates stories.

79
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.390
They let you save them now.
Now they say,
yeah,

80
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.860
this was like three weeks before that,
unfortunately.

81
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.020
So this place is miserable.
It's rainy all the time.

82
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.420
High winds,
thick,
thick,
dense vegetation and literal monsters.

83
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.340
Yeah.
I mean giant bears and then big,
um,

84
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.490
the elk are probably with they way they wait,

85
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.190
they can wait up to 1400 pounds,
these elk.
So sex is way bigger.
Yeah.

86
00:05:14.191 --> 00:05:18.330
It was like the size of two normal elk weight-wise cause like an average elk

87
00:05:18.331 --> 00:05:21.870
would probably be around 500 pounds in most places.

88
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.840
Really big one.

89
00:05:23.841 --> 00:05:26.660
Like we were talking about the California ones that to hone sometimes can get to

90
00:05:26.661 --> 00:05:30.530
a thousand this is another 400 pounds.
Big.
Exactly.
It's a lot.

91
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.290
It's a big game and there's bears eat those giant ant giant.

92
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.490
The the barriers can be over 1200 1500 pounds themselves.

93
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.390
11 feet.
Yeah.
11 feet and feet.

94
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.490
It's nuts.
11 foot bear.
Nope.

95
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.890
This one that attacked you guys.
How big do you think it was if you had to guess?

96
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.910
I would say,
well I would say it's 11 and a half feet.

97
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.740
No,
because actually after we went in there,

98
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:03.110
my friend who's a pilot there and dropped us off,

99
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.500
he called me about a week or two later and he's like,

100
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:10.370
they shot that bear that when after you guys,
somebody went in there,

101
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.620
same place.
Bear attacked him.
They killed it in self defense.

102
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.820
It was 11 and a half feet and I think almost 1200 pounds.

103
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.570
So there's very good odds that that was the same bear.

104
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.650
I would imagine that it was.
There's a very,
I mean cause I just,
same area,

105
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.790
same area had taken over that area,
seemed about the same sock when I,

106
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.740
when it came in,
I thought that's a big bore.

107
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.990
It wasn't one of those ones you think,
oh that's a,

108
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.630
it looked like a big mature animal

109
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.570
in there piecing together what happened in my mind later.
But yeah,

110
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:47.270
so we're hunting elk on this island.

111
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.070
Stephen's up getting an l,
we hang it in the tree.

112
00:06:52.071 --> 00:06:55.400
We do all the stuff you're supposed to do,
get the meat away from the carcass.

113
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.310
But we had yet to see a bear up until this point.

114
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.400
And when my brother and I went in there a few years earlier,

115
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.050
we just saw bears every day.
We'd see six beers a day.
So your mind's just bear,

116
00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:07.490
bear,
bear.
When you're seeing him all the time,

117
00:07:07.491 --> 00:07:08.690
when you weren't seeing him all the time,

118
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:14.080
you get a little lax and that's where we really screwed up because the attack

119
00:07:15.531 --> 00:07:17.690
went down.
No one was prepared.

120
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:22.690
We were just sitting around having some sandwiches and one of the,
so we're,

121
00:07:22.691 --> 00:07:23.000
we're,

122
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.840
we're filming and there was six of us all together and I think that large group,

123
00:07:26.841 --> 00:07:31.841
that six is what saved us because when the bear Ranney and it was six of us

124
00:07:32.571 --> 00:07:36.200
sitting kind of in like a semi circle strange circle.

125
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:41.740
And when that bear came in we did that scatter effect and I think that scatter

126
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.590
was kind of like if a lion is going after a zebra,

127
00:07:45.591 --> 00:07:49.940
they use their numbers and stripes to confuse the lion is that scattering of

128
00:07:49.941 --> 00:07:54.650
things just going everywhere that that caused confusion for the bear.

129
00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.920
So I think the bear went in thinking whatever's under that tree,

130
00:07:57.921 --> 00:07:58.790
I'm going to kill it.

131
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:03.020
And it thought it was one thing and when we blew up into six different pieces,

132
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.740
it just tried to kill everything at once and couldn't actually get one person,

133
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:11.690
God.
But so lucky.
Yeah,
it was crazy because we're sitting down,

134
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:16.390
we decided,
oh we'll have lunch before we hiked back.
Cause the day before we,

135
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.990
we hiked along ways.

136
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:22.790
We got back to camp at three in the morning or something.
I can't remember,

137
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:27.320
two or three in the morning,
we'd barely eaten.
So everyone was just thinking,

138
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.470
let's have lunch,
regroup,
hike out.

139
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:36.190
So we're pat when the other guys that was with us brought the jet boiled boil up

140
00:08:37.431 --> 00:08:38.264
some coffee.

141
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:42.890
So I was going around collecting water from everyone to get coffee going around.

142
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:45.500
And when I sat down,
I took my pack off and I,

143
00:08:45.501 --> 00:08:48.470
the whole week I've been doing this thing where I take my pistol from the PAC

144
00:08:48.471 --> 00:08:51.230
belt and put it on the holster on my body.

145
00:08:51.231 --> 00:08:53.720
When I dropped my pack and I,

146
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.090
it was that weird deal where I took the pack off and I'm thinking about

147
00:08:57.091 --> 00:09:01.590
switching and I'm like,
no,
it's fine.
You know?
And I thought,
I'll just sit,

148
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.510
because there's few times I'd set my pack down and I was like,

149
00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:07.040
I'll just sit a lay on my pack,
like as a chair,
a backrest,

150
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.340
and then I'll flop the,
you know,

151
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.240
have the pistol right there so it's within arms reach and I'll be sitting there

152
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.620
while I go around and get the water.

153
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.080
And then someone had moved kind of where I was sitting.
So now,

154
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:21.410
so I sit down across from the pack where my pistol is and then thinking,

155
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.970
and I was thinking about,
Oh hey,
hand me that pistol.
But I just was like,
Eh,

156
00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:30.160
you know,
you don't want to be that guy.
Like oh yeah,
the guys that need it.

157
00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.570
Exactly right.
We did not,
everybody had pistols,

158
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:39.060
just me and Yanna set a pistol and then,
and then Pat's behind us.
He goes,

159
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.350
I hear something and I look up and that's,
that bears like dead set.

160
00:09:43.351 --> 00:09:46.710
So Steve would be where you are.
The bear behind Steve.

161
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:51.150
So like Steve was between me and the bear,
his back was to it.
Like how far away?

162
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:56.100
Not Far,
I dunno,
30 yards or something the first time you see that 30 yards.

163
00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:01.800
Yeah,
it's dead run super fast.
And I just locked eyes with this thing.

164
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.110
I mean I see it coming in the whole way,

165
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.760
just bdis locked in on me and I think this is going to kill me.

166
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.390
And so I'm thinking,
you know,
when I say I'm thinking,

167
00:10:12.391 --> 00:10:14.910
I don't know if I'm thinking,
I'm just,

168
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:19.080
I just remembered what I was kind of going through my head at the time.

169
00:10:19.081 --> 00:10:21.330
I thought,
Oh fuck,
I'm gonna die.

170
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.690
And my protections right there like I'm going to die.

171
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.420
This is that situation where I'm dead.

172
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.820
And they talk about it and he could have saved himself,

173
00:10:29.821 --> 00:10:31.920
but his guns on the ground.
And I think that that was like,

174
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:36.270
go for the gun was my whole thing.
So I start to go for the gun.

175
00:10:36.271 --> 00:10:38.820
You honestly would have been here as I remember it.

176
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:41.490
And so I start to go for the gun and realized,
fuck,

177
00:10:41.491 --> 00:10:42.630
I don't have time to get to my gun.

178
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:47.660
And it's three feet away to that bears right there comes down on me so fast.

179
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:52.020
So I kind of do like a football juke move left,
right.

180
00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:53.520
And then wheel around right.

181
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:56.850
Do like a spin with my back and they start running to the left.

182
00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.040
And at that point Yonis it,
I,

183
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:03.540
I didn't know this at the time cause I looked at some pictures afterwards,

184
00:11:03.541 --> 00:11:06.540
kind of piece everything together.
So Yannis was sitting right next to me.

185
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.900
I think he got up to turn.
There were some trekking poles right here.

186
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.900
He grabbed a trekking pole.
So probably while I was joking,

187
00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:15.900
he reached around and grabbed the trekking pole,
swings around,

188
00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:20.310
hits the bear in the face.
She's so then the IC,
the bear running off.

189
00:11:20.311 --> 00:11:22.650
Then I see someone going down the mountain with the bear.

190
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:25.020
I'm thinking he's got someone.
So I grabbed my pistol,

191
00:11:25.021 --> 00:11:28.580
start going down the mountain yelling,
Oh,
count off,

192
00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:33.090
I guess I count off.
And everyone's like,
Whoa,
whoa.
And I'm like,
Oh shit.

193
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.560
Who's missing.
Right.
And then Garrett pops up out of the bushes and his,

194
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:41.730
he's like,
why he died?
So Garrett,
Ak dirt,
dirt myth.

195
00:11:41.731 --> 00:11:45.660
He's the one who was on top of the,
somehow he's on the barriers back.

196
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.920
So I think when the bear wheeled around you like hit him and he ends up on the

197
00:11:49.921 --> 00:11:52.830
back.
So I saw just legs and bear going down the,

198
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.580
I saw his legs on the back of the bear scene.
Maybe the bear had him in his job.

199
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.580
Yeah,
that's what I was thinking.
Wow.
I mean,
who would think

200
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.160
like if that was in a movie you'd be like,
get the fuck outta here.

201
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:09.580
I think what was the anchorman where the guy's like,
you're riding the bear.

202
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.780
It's exactly like,
yes.

203
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:18.370
And then we just kind of circled up around the tree and the real scary part was

204
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:22.390
that bear.
Why it was so thick.
You really couldn't see.

205
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:24.790
And you could see maybe as far as the Wallace from us,

206
00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:29.650
which was that the true eight feet.
Yeah.
And just real thick brush.

207
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:31.780
And you'd hear the bear charge.
And again,

208
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.320
and we only have the two pistols Yiannis and I and the the,

209
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.350
the wind was so strong,
there's no way we could use bear spray.

210
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:43.330
So we hear the bay charging in and me and Yannis or like pistols out ready,

211
00:12:43.331 --> 00:12:46.840
waiting for this thing to pop out at point blank range and then it would,

212
00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:47.853
and you were yelling

213
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:55.000
and then that thing stops and then it would just crash off and then it would

214
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.800
charge in from the other direction.

215
00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.280
She ain't gotta like circle around the tree the other way and did that,

216
00:13:00.281 --> 00:13:02.830
I think three times.
That was just a nerd.

217
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:06.040
It's like a horror movie where it keeps coming in from different angles.

218
00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:10.630
It was weird.
It was not a fun feeling.
You just felt so small.

219
00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:14.560
So you guys had come back to the carcass that was hanging in the tree and it had

220
00:13:14.561 --> 00:13:16.270
probably claim that carcass.

221
00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.720
We don't know it knew the glorious was there.

222
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:24.750
I assume now the weird thing was is it came in with the wind,

223
00:13:24.851 --> 00:13:29.851
so the wind was blowing pretty stiff and say into our face and the bear came in

224
00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:36.280
with the wind,
so he wasn't going into the scent.
Normally they go around,

225
00:13:36.281 --> 00:13:37.780
they catch the scent and they charge in.

226
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.110
So I don't know if you'd heard something if he was there.

227
00:13:41.111 --> 00:13:44.050
We saw what slightly looked like bare sign.

228
00:13:44.051 --> 00:13:48.670
Both Steve and Steve and I kind of pointed it out,
but we weren't,

229
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.150
we were thinking maybe it was something older you wouldn't you say bear sign?

230
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:56.860
You mean bear shit?
Yeah,
bear shit in the base of the tree.
Yeah.
And so I think,

231
00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.560
you know,
we did some things that were wrong,
but in,

232
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:04.680
in the instance what saved us all now if we were to do it a hundred times over,

233
00:14:05.621 --> 00:14:09.280
I would say I would do it differently.
But it worked out how it worked out.

234
00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:10.910
So I obviously wouldn't,

235
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:15.490
I would never opt to just have nothing and have this weird scatter effect.

236
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.810
But I think that what saved everyone from getting anyone from getting hurt,

237
00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:23.680
which is a miracle,
was the fact that when we scattered,

238
00:14:23.681 --> 00:14:27.580
it just confused that bear because he kind of had this look after you started.

239
00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.260
You started wheeling around kind of like trying to pick a person,

240
00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:32.740
trying to go,

241
00:14:32.741 --> 00:14:37.360
and he couldn't target one individual and then things started hitting him and

242
00:14:37.361 --> 00:14:40.810
somebody is on his back and I think it just freaked him out and he went off to

243
00:14:40.811 --> 00:14:43.330
regroup,
keep charging back in,

244
00:14:43.331 --> 00:14:48.100
but never made that full charge all the way back in again.
Wow.
That's crazy.

245
00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:52.760
How many people have ever gone through a bear attack?
Unscaved like that.

246
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:54.570
And a group of six.
Yeah,

247
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:58.970
and the thing about it was it wasn't just a bear attack,

248
00:14:58.971 --> 00:15:01.760
but had looking at it later,

249
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:05.180
had someone even been grabbed and mauled,

250
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:06.920
not to death but injured,

251
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.300
I think that it would've been very unlikely that that person was survived

252
00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:15.320
because we,
the weather that came in was so bad.

253
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:18.440
I don't know if it was a hundred mile an hour winds.
I mean,

254
00:15:18.441 --> 00:15:21.230
you weren't getting rescued in a hundred mile an hour winds,
I wouldn't think,

255
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.810
I dunno those coast guard helicopters.

256
00:15:23.811 --> 00:15:26.720
I'm not really sure what they're capable of.
Maybe someone would just say,
yeah,

257
00:15:26.721 --> 00:15:29.480
we'd,
we'd go,
but that would be a very hard thing.
