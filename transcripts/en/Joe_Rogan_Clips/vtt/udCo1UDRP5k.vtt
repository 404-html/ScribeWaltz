WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.110
To the shoulder or to the biceps and the animal like this to the elbow to the

2
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.380
shoulder.
Different.
No,
no,
no.
You have to do it.

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.330
We're talking fricking ongoing abuse.
Number one.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,

4
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.610
no.
Well,
dream.
And then you come right back.
DMT.
If you hate that shit.

5
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.980
James is on point as well.
Let's get serious.

6
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.800
Let's get Siri just share a few things before he goes down this road.
Okay.

7
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.190
These are the,
what are the rope?
But I wasn't going down.
I'll roll.

8
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.160
We just talking about,
we know what the road is there talking about George Soros.

9
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.780
No,
no,
no.
We passed that.
Well,
we just talking about,
uh,

10
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.740
you were talking about the Strip club.
The Guy Choking the girl,

11
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.100
the girl truck and the guy out.
The Guy Falling and hitting his head.

12
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.180
And then what happened after that?
Any ideas,
Jamie?
No one.

13
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.110
Everyone's stupid for that one or that one time I got choked out.

14
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.160
I remember watching the babies.
I remember one time it was,
it was cool.

15
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.900
I don't think I've ever been choked completely out of 35 seconds.

16
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.300
The first time I got chucked out,

17
00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:59.301
it was like the 17 year old super hot chick and I was like 13 tied up and she

18
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:03.150
lived down the street.
No,
no.
She goes,
I already,

19
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.820
I got permission so I was pretty young like 12 and she goes,

20
00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:08.040
I'll have sex with you.
It was a true story.

21
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.910
I'll have sex with you if you let me put makeup on you so I'm not in the gates.

22
00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:16.830
Everything show the girl puts the makeup on it as sex with her and she's super

23
00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:20.370
hot and then like a week later she goes,
now I'm going to choke you out.

24
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.700
In that relationship went really well until like 30 year old boyfriend caught me

25
00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:29.910
at her place wants cause her mom was always working and trying to kill me in the

26
00:01:29.911 --> 00:01:34.170
parking lot.
Oh my God,
I'll have sex with you.
I can put makeup on you.

27
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.680
I let her go full deal.
You listen,
you're a wise man.
She can.

28
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.130
That bitch can dress me up like a clown.

29
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.000
Here's some of the things I have and then we'll get to go forever.
He goes,

30
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.800
not conspiracies,
but real world programs developing a breakaway civilization.

31
00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:57.030
What does a breakaway civilization?

32
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.100
You understand that it's the key to everything.
Standardized total surveillance,

33
00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:05.490
control grid,
the power.
Despise the power control.
Human animal hybrids.

34
00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:09.090
We recover that.
Mass farming of humanoid tissue transhuman end game.

35
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.850
We come into and multilayered binary weapons delivery systems.

36
00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:15.360
That's when we haven't had,
oh what's that?
Well,
we'll get into some of that.

37
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.610
The pain is five g behavioral modifications.

38
00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:21.270
We hit that Trojan horse delivery system,
cell phones,
vaccines.

39
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.410
Gmos have been tested and designed to hurt you.
Again,
vaccines are real.

40
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.220
You can give somebody something that gives them the cure.

41
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.170
Another disease that doesn't yet,
but they're jacking it like a cell phone.

42
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.000
They're adding stuff in your ticket to immortality that we think so.

43
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.670
Let's cover that.
What do you think is happening with vaccines?
I know,
okay,

44
00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:41.910
tell me what's going on.
I always use this cause everyone's heard of it.

45
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.570
Everyone heard about 1947 to 1983 and it only came public because the program

46
00:02:50.401 --> 00:02:53.970
was exposed in Peru and promote disclosed in West Virginia.

47
00:02:53.971 --> 00:02:56.010
But the media picked up because it was white on black,

48
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.950
not all the white people that happened to,
I don't care if you're black or white,

49
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.470
injecting over a million people with live syphilis in the name of vaccines.

50
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:07.450
You know about Tuskegee that do know about that.

51
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.310
But you only know about Alabama and over 40 something years only injecting

52
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:16.180
blacks.
But it happened all the world search engine.

53
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.480
Hillary Clinton apologizes for syphilis experiments in Tuskegee.

54
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.570
It was [inaudible].
It was,
it was in Peru.
Can I ask you,

55
00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:28.060
this was the Tuskegee was the,
um,

56
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.660
the conventional story that they had syphilis but they weren't really curing

57
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:37.210
them.
That's a cover.
No,
but it's not what they say if you actually read it.
No,

58
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.410
they were giving him selfless.
Okay.
I understand what you're saying.
But was the,

59
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.900
the,
the conventional explanation of what happened was that,

60
00:03:45.901 --> 00:03:49.160
that they knew that they had it and they allowed them to know that was the

61
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.550
[inaudible] came out.
Okay.

62
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.120
Have you heard about hearing this right there us apologizes for Guatemala,

63
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:59.880
STD experiments.
They did all the different ones.
Just type Peru,
ruin medic.

64
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.330
Hold on.
Gift him for in this.

65
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.850
Can you make that a little goats scroll up so I can read it.

66
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.410
A U s government medical researchers intentionally infected hundreds of people

67
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:13.411
in Guatemala including institutionalized mental patients with gonorrhea and

68
00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:19.060
syphilis without their knowledge or permission more than 60 years ago.

69
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.580
Jesus Christ.
Show Joe again.
Um,
when you've read,

70
00:04:24.581 --> 00:04:28.540
cause what I do is,
oh Jesus Christ.
Look at this.
Many of those infected.

71
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:32.770
We're encouraged to pass the infection.
As you judge as part of the study,

72
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.660
where does this end?
What is NBC News?

73
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.990
Imagine finding out you have syphilis but you've never had sex before.

74
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.870
Let me stop.
Let me,

75
00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:44.110
Shaw's is gone and you imagine how confusing are you ready for another ultra

76
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:47.740
secret since this 46 to what?
46 two sorry.

77
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.110
It says at the [inaudible] 69,
1948 God damn.

78
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.700
Nine 46 months.
That's all I watched.
That's not okay.
It's not two years.
Okay.

79
00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.640
She'll,
she'll,
she'll let me expand
then.
Imagine Joe,

80
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.980
here's what's happened.
Okay.
We had a real liberal media in this country.

81
00:05:05.981 --> 00:05:08.050
They weren't leftist.
That's,
that's a cultic that's different.

82
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.510
We had a real liberal media in this country that had problems,

83
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.090
but they really cared.
They were open minded.

84
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.660
When I said Delta has done information a few years after I proved Delta Force

85
00:05:16.661 --> 00:05:20.260
was and she had one and [inaudible] 99 and proved it.
They all shed.

86
00:05:20.261 --> 00:05:21.610
Alex Jones just ride.
It's incredible.

87
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.160
That's the WTO tape that I always cite that tight that we showed.

88
00:05:25.161 --> 00:05:29.310
The agent provocateurs went into a peaceful protest and started smashing windows

89
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.260
and I'm not against the army,
but Delta Force rent because I always go,
oh no,

90
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.640
the army's terrorist.
Like you should.

91
00:05:33.641 --> 00:05:36.700
I don't call it the whole garden meant a select group of the army did that.

92
00:05:36.701 --> 00:05:39.390
They staged it.
Show,
imagine use to the,

93
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.540
the press would get a lot of stuff right,
but they would get demoted or whatever.

94
00:05:43.541 --> 00:05:47.080
What happened once Trump got in,

95
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.360
which I don't think Trump's pad and a gut level that he's good,

96
00:05:49.361 --> 00:05:52.330
but I almost think like it's more sophisticated.

97
00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:55.680
They putting them in knowing it piss everybody off to get the liberals who

98
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.730
traditionally have been the real watchdogs free speech and against human

99
00:05:58.731 --> 00:06:02.180
experimentation and suddenly they're like in Gallup polls,
we love war.

100
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.340
We love experimentation.
We love everything.

101
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.010
I'm getting chills right now and so imagine Joe,

102
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.310
I've been on air for 23 years and I'm a news hound.

103
00:06:10.311 --> 00:06:11.840
I spend four or five hours a day reading news,

104
00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.100
so I will probably leave NBC news that our government gave people.

105
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.000
Notice I said Peru because that was a big document,

106
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:22.790
a case you just found Guatemala,
different things.
He track of this.

107
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.590
We'll just went under the A's.
It's still going on,
so imagine,

108
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.810
imagine I have literally by the time Sandy Hook happens,

109
00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:37.811
I've literally seen 10,000 articles and documents are more where they're

110
00:06:37.941 --> 00:06:42.230
admitting.
In 1962 the joint chiefs of staff under Llm,

111
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.800
Sir came to President Kennedy.
This was on PBS and said,

112
00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:47.420
we're going to blow up buildings.

113
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:52.220
Shoot up schools and movie theaters and bomb army bases and marine basis.

114
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.170
We're going to have people with their kids with name change and or CIA get on a

115
00:06:57.171 --> 00:07:01.400
jumbo jet.
The techs off it gets blown up over the Caribbean.

116
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.690
We blame Cuba,

117
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.280
but that plane really lands and there's another plane that's a drone.

118
00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:11.660
We blow up and then Kennedy says,
no,
but his brother says,
no,
I'll do.

119
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.480
It's why they killed Kennedy because Bobby said he would,

120
00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:16.880
but then he got pissed when they killed his brother sold declassified.

121
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
He wanted to bomb the Honduran embassy and blow up stuff and go to war with

122
00:07:22.371 --> 00:07:26.930
Moscow.
Bobby was bad.
You could actually,
this is,
you can pull this up,
pull up.

123
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.440
Bobby Kennedy wanted to bomb the u s embassy in Honduras.

124
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.510
This is declassified.

125
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.840
And so imagine you see hundreds of these and then a sandy hook happens and your

126
00:07:38.181 --> 00:07:42.860
listeners don't buy it and then it's a psychosis where then,
well,

127
00:07:42.861 --> 00:07:46.400
because every,
every man I knew,
and this is hypothetical debate,
that was great.

128
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.090
Every man I knew when I was a kid backhanded me and beat the crap out of me.

129
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.540
So men are bad or a woman that's been raped.
She takes all men are bad show.

130
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.620
I get like the psychosis and I'm not trying to put myself down like I'm a
victim.

131
00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:58.551
I'm being honest.

132
00:07:58.551 --> 00:08:03.380
Retrospectively that got to where when I learned that so much stuff was false.

133
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:07.580
Then later I experienced where I had the guest.

134
00:08:07.581 --> 00:08:08.420
I did the thing,

135
00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:12.680
I knew it was true and then people made up a whole story because they don't

136
00:08:12.681 --> 00:08:15.200
believe anything anymore.
So that's all I'm trying to say.

137
00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:18.550
Do you think it part of it is that even though this stuff does exist,

138
00:08:18.551 --> 00:08:21.760
it's almost like there's too many things happening for one person to pay

139
00:08:21.761 --> 00:08:25.540
attention to all of them.
And if you're only focusing on emotional overload,

140
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.430
if you're only,
but hold on,
if you're only focusing on that aspect of life,

141
00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.100
it can be incredibly overwhelming cause you start thinking that's the whole

142
00:08:33.101 --> 00:08:36.550
world that the whole world's these conspiracies cause these are the things

143
00:08:36.551 --> 00:08:40.670
you're concentrating on primarily.
But this,
this what I'm saying?
That's his,

144
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.640
he just talked about operation Northwoods,
that whole thing.
Yeah.

145
00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:48.190
Operation Northwoods.
Yeah.
That is some,
that's about as ABC,

146
00:08:48.191 --> 00:08:50.960
that's about us.
That's true.
Clear as day clear.

147
00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.650
But if you break it down and you look at it and say,

148
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.160
you look at Operation Northwoods,

149
00:08:56.161 --> 00:09:01.161
you look at that shit that is about as gangster and sinister and evil as we went

150
00:09:02.131 --> 00:09:04.230
over just a little while ago,
we were going into totally.

151
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:09.680
My point is if you believe that no other conspiracy theory,

152
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.600
whether they're right or wrong,
like government conspiracy should be ridiculed.

153
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:19.170
You shouldn't,
there's no,
there should be no ridicule.
You're right.
You should,

154
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.110
instead of looking at them with riveter,
cool.

155
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.660
You should look at them objectively and event.
Exactly.
And the only,

156
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:29.690
the only people that have a right to ridicule a conspiracy theories are people

157
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.020
that don't believe in any conspiracy theories.

158
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.030
If you don't believe in any of them,
yes,

159
00:09:36.031 --> 00:09:40.410
I understand why you're really killing it people all the time to leave them.

160
00:09:40.411 --> 00:09:45.270
Some of them,
if you believe in some of them,
the other ones you don't believe in.

161
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:49.770
I think you should be more.
Uh,
I don't believe in that shit,

162
00:09:49.771 --> 00:09:53.890
but I understand why my defense almost now almost we could probably get the

163
00:09:53.891 --> 00:09:57.080
store on a cord.
I'm also looking forward to trial in Texas and,

164
00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:00.390
and Connecticut because I want to,
and the Lord has already agreed.

165
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:04.260
I'm going to sit there and I'm going to show them history and all these things

166
00:10:04.261 --> 00:10:07.380
and say like,
I mean,
I watched the,
uh,

167
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.610
it's already been out for like a year or two,

168
00:10:08.611 --> 00:10:12.840
but I watched the minions three or four and it's like in the 60s.

169
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:16.180
And they break it down to the set of Hollywood and the moon landings being

170
00:10:16.181 --> 00:10:19.530
staged now.
Now astronauts died doing that.

171
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:23.790
So how traumatic is that for their family?
But I believe that [inaudible]

172
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:28.700
we're going to have to in a minute.
Wait,
wait.
Astronauts done which ones?
Oh,

173
00:10:28.701 --> 00:10:31.620
a space shuttle.
When we're going to talk about it.
No,
no,
they just,

174
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.170
the bus from Apollo launchpad

175
00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:37.760
was talking to one or not

176
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.300
practicing.
Yes,
they were practicing.
I'm curious.
