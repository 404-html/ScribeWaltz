Hello Freak bitches and aren't binary star systems really comments more than

2
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.140
half the stars you've seen the night sky or binary or multiple systems.
In fact,

3
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.090
the iconic image from Star Wars,

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.850
the original star wars movie before they numbered them,

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.770
I think what star wars for [inaudible] right when they were,
well,
yeah,
whatever,

6
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.120
whatever that that,
that,

7
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.210
that desert planet that Luke was on and he comes out after visiting his was what

8
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:27.691
is the step parent?

9
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:31.650
Know his adoptive parents wa I don't remember who he was visiting.

10
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.540
He comes out and you see a double sunset.

11
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.490
So that's basically the only accurate science and the entire series.

12
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.310
It's star wars series
thousand.

13
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.980
Nothing I really enjoyed is you're taking a part of gravity gravity and how many

14
00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:50.160
people got mad movie?
Yeah,
you don't.
So I stopped coming.
Come movies.

15
00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:53.730
I don't need to Piss people off.
I think when I watch a movie,

16
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.800
I'm having those thoughts anyway,

17
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.950
so I might as well share them with people if you're interested.

18
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.270
So I did just that.
And then people,
the last time I did it was for star wars.

19
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.710
The Force Awakens Star Wars seven.
I had a series of tweets,
you know,

20
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.590
one of them was um,
BB eight,

21
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.620
a smooth rolling metal spherical ball would have skidded uncontrollably on sand.

22
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.980
People got angry so much.
So what?
Tweeted back,
shut the fuck up.

23
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.080
Okay.
So,
so I said,
okay,
I'm not here to get people angry.

24
00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:32.130
I'm just here to enlightened to help people enhance their movie going
experience.

25
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.610
But to the extent that is not accomplishing this,
I don't need to do it.

26
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.170
I'm just saying I don't,
I'm an educator.
I thought I was being nice.

27
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.410
I don't need to do.
So I haven't tweeted about a movie since then.
I got tweets,

28
00:01:43.411 --> 00:01:47.220
I could post them,
stop.
I have tweets I could post about arrival

29
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.680
was a little bit of a shut it off.
Okay.
No,
you've got to give it a chance.
I,

30
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.340
as soon as I see a movie that starts out,
I don't spoil.

31
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.460
Alert starts out with a sick kid.
I'm like,
fuck you.
No,
no,
no.
You're doing no.

32
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.170
In fact,
it's very not about the kid.

33
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.000
I'm sure that's why I keep is totally not about the kid.
Chamie hated it.
Oh yeah,

34
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.930
yeah.
Okay.
So you just give it a chance.
But anyhow,

35
00:02:09.931 --> 00:02:13.710
so I just stopped.
Maybe I'll come back,
but I'm,
yeah,

36
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.350
and people need to know gravity.

37
00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:20.010
That was good that you explained that not only is this not plausible,

38
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.610
those two satellites on anywhere near each other,
they're like,
God said,
oh,

39
00:02:23.611 --> 00:02:24.300
there's the,

40
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.630
there's the international space station and I'm on the Chinese space station.

41
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.980
Let me just jet pack my way there.
Do you really,

42
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.190
excuse me lady.
Hey Lady.

43
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.530
Do you know how far away these are from one another?

44
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.040
You can just jet around from one space station to another.
No,
can't do it.

45
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.150
There are tens of thousands of miles from one another,
but goodness sakes.
So,

46
00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:46.440
but anyhow,
so I,
yeah,

47
00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:50.940
you remembered it was like 15 tweets and I didn't know that was when I realized

48
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.590
like the press was reading my movie tweets and those tweets.

49
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.710
There's now a couple of years ago when the gravity came out with Sandra Bullock

50
00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:03.250
and,
and,
and um,
uh,
uh,

51
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.050
what's the dude's name?
George Clooney.

52
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.290
So I tweeted it and they got talked about on the t on the today show,

53
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.020
set the set the weekend today show on NBC.

54
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.390
Then it was talked about on NBC nightly news.

55
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.230
Then my tweets were talking about on Saturday night lives,
the weekend update.

56
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.600
It was like the NBC Trifecta.
And I said,
my gosh,
this was,

57
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.070
I had not,
that was not the point.
I didn't seek this,
that fine.

58
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:33.970
I'm glad they are reacting this way because that means they care about the

59
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:36.960
science may be.
But what Seth Meyers it,

60
00:03:36.961 --> 00:03:40.170
cause he was doing weekend update at the time.
He said,
uh,

61
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.300
astrophysicist Neil degrasse station harshly criticized the movie.
Granary uh,

62
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.740
saying has contains a number of scientific and accuracies,
for example.

63
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.840
There is no way George Clooney would have spent that much time talking to a

64
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:56.860
woman his own age.
That's hilarious.

65
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.960
I think Sandra Bullock's still younger than George Clooney though.

66
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.620
So they should have got their facts but not,
yeah,
but not by much.
I mean,
yeah,

67
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.420
they were the same neighborhood.
Yeah,
I think it's important.

68
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.260
I think you enjoy the movie.
It's great.
It's fun.
And everything like that.

69
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.710
But it's important to point out what the science errors are.
I think.

70
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.910
I think that the,
I think the movie could have done better,
honestly.
You know,

71
00:04:18.911 --> 00:04:21.120
things they could have made the same movie I did collect.

72
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.680
Some people thought I didn't like the movie when all I was doing was pointing

73
00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:27.220
out things they got wrong.
By the way,
they did some stunning things correctly.

74
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.170
For example,
this was,
this was brilliant.

75
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.420
If you're in zero g a fire basically puts itself out.

76
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.240
So think about when you burn a candle on earth.
Uh,
so you light the wick.

77
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.460
If there's people have candles anymore,
they'd forgot what a candle.

78
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.780
You light it with a match that you used to get from smoking lounges and bars.

79
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.230
All right,
so you light the candle and it stays lit.

80
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.820
The fuel is the wax.

81
00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.300
The oxygen continually comes in because it heats the air around it in the air

82
00:05:00.551 --> 00:05:05.530
rises,
hot air rises and fresh air comes in from below and has fresh oxygen.

83
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.220
So the candle stay lit until it burns all the way down in space.

84
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.820
If you light a candle,
you can light the candle.
It'll heat the air,

85
00:05:12.821 --> 00:05:16.840
but the air will not know where to go because it's not lighter than everything

86
00:05:16.841 --> 00:05:20.440
because it's in zero g it's a stake clustered around the candle.

87
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.370
The candle will use up all the oxygen in that bubble and that it'll put itself

88
00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:27.010
out.
They did this in the movie,

89
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.520
so why did they have some good science?
Because they make,

90
00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:32.790
you can't think of everything,
so they just have you on staff.

91
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.360
She couldn't think of anything if I,
so you can't think of everything.

92
00:05:37.361 --> 00:05:40.360
So I wasn't judgemental so much as this movie.

93
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:46.380
The fact that it got so much right is what put it on my map to criticize what it

94
00:05:46.751 --> 00:05:50.740
got wrong.
That makes sense at,
does that make that make sense?
Okay,

95
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.530
that's good to hear the word Yo.
All the hair,

96
00:05:53.531 --> 00:05:56.830
her bangs should have been floating,
floating all over it.
Now if you might think,

97
00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.120
am I the nit picky?
No,
because if you'll get any picture of somebody with hair,

98
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.990
okay,
in space in zero g there,
here is flying everywhere.

99
00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:09.590
It was the first thing you notice about them.
It is so obvious like,
wow,

100
00:06:09.591 --> 00:06:13.280
that's the cool,
you're not thinking about the space ship or the tie technology.

101
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.911
You look at it,

102
00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:17.780
the hair doing stuff you will never see happen on earth unless someone is like

103
00:06:17.781 --> 00:06:19.730
underwater and they're jiggling their head.

104
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.040
So they would have to film it all in zero gravity.

105
00:06:22.041 --> 00:06:25.050
They would have to film it on when those drop things or the drop thing,

106
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.310
they'd have to be clever about it.
And she only had bangs.

107
00:06:28.311 --> 00:06:31.280
That's all you have to figure out how to,
they did other clever things.
So anyway,

108
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:34.220
that's all I did play.
By the way.
In all fairness to movies,

109
00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:37.280
I'll call out something that's good.
That science,

110
00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:40.790
that movie got right that otherwise got no science.
Right.
I'll be,

111
00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:45.020
I'm the first in line to do that.
Like what?
Oh,
uh,

112
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.610
in the movie monsters inc.
Oh my gosh.
You've in fact doing the thing.

113
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:53.360
I was going there.
And did you,
uh,
those doors were four dimensional portals to,

114
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.100
to another.
That's possible.
Well,
if you had four dimensions,

115
00:06:58.101 --> 00:07:00.470
that's what it would look like.
Do you remember the movie?
Yes.

116
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.400
They take the doors home.
Yes.

117
00:07:02.401 --> 00:07:06.830
They opened the door and they're in the closet of the kid that they're going to

118
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:11.030
terrorize.
Yes.
That's a wormhole.
That's what that is.

119
00:07:11.031 --> 00:07:14.390
What access to the fourth dimension looks like?
Do you think scientifically?

120
00:07:14.391 --> 00:07:19.040
That's possible one day?
I hope so.
I hope so.
Cause here's the example.

121
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.730
W W we've got a nice broad desk.
We here at that,
at this interview,
right?

122
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.830
So desk is two dimensions.

123
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.630
It's got length and width and I can start putting papers on this desk and I can

124
00:07:29.631 --> 00:07:31.760
lay them out mosaic style.

125
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.060
And then all of a sudden I have no more room to put a sheet of paper.

126
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.710
If I'm an aunt living in this surface of the desk,
I say,
no more room,

127
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:41.540
but wait a minute,

128
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:46.540
we are three dimensional people and I can put an organizer and and and stack

129
00:07:46.911 --> 00:07:51.911
things vertically so I can take a sheet of paper and now I can put it higher up

130
00:07:52.281 --> 00:07:56.180
than the surface of the desk.
The aunt will say,
we did it go,
oh my gosh,

131
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.990
it disappeared in some portal.
We're no,
no.
What?
What is that?

132
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:04.670
It went into the third dimension and the aunt bound and obviously as a three

133
00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:08.180
dimensional thing,
right?
And imagine it only lives in two dimensions.

134
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:12.680
You would have made that paper disappear into a third dimension and it will have

135
00:08:12.681 --> 00:08:15.650
no clue where it went because you had a portal,

136
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.290
you had access to the extra dimension.

137
00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:23.770
So look at how much you can store on a desk when you have access to a third

138
00:08:24.201 --> 00:08:25.100
dimension above it.

139
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.500
Vastly more than just papers mosaic out on the surface.

140
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.100
So now let's up this example by a dimension.

141
00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:38.400
You're storing boxes in a room or I ran out of room.
No you didn't.

142
00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.390
Let's open this four dimensional door.
You open it,

143
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:46.160
put the boxes through the door,
close the door,
boxes gone.

144
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.950
That'd be awesome.
For hoarders you,
you look around the other side of the bar,

145
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.550
the door,
there's nothing there,
right?
The your side of the door,
nothing there.

146
00:08:53.551 --> 00:08:58.551
It's just a door that a portal to a fourth dimension that can hold vastly more

147
00:08:58.951 --> 00:08:59.784
content.

148
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.840
Then what is what you're stuck storing in the three dimensional space of your

149
00:09:03.841 --> 00:09:06.600
room.
Now that sounds so the,
that's a brilliant concept.

150
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.960
And even though it has monsters that don't exist that all speak English and is,

151
00:09:09.961 --> 00:09:12.150
one of them is a cycle ops,
and one of them is,
uh,
you know,

152
00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:15.270
I'm not judging the biophysiology of these creatures,

153
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:20.040
but they got the physics of a four dimensional portals completely accurate.

154
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:24.160
Now the concept of dimensions is where it gets really abstract with Pete,

155
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:28.660
I love me some dimensions,
and it is abstract.
It is.
No,
and that's why you,

156
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:29.610
you've take,

157
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:34.260
let the math take you into those higher dimensions because our intuition will

158
00:09:34.261 --> 00:09:35.520
not,
will fail for us.

159
00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:44.200
<v 1>Yeah.</v>
