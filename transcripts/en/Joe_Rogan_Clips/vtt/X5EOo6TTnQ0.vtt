WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
So anyway,
since that time I've,
I've gone after many different things.
Um,

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.470
peanut pop off the evangelists said he was getting the word of God.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.830
Randy came to Houston in 1986 the guy that had the earpiece in.
Yeah,

4
00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:13.950
I found the earpiece.
Oh,
you found that was me.
Yeah.

5
00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:17.670
So Randy was writing an article,
I think it was a hustler magazine.

6
00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:20.240
It was one of those magazines on evangelists.
Angela.

7
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.410
So it was a good place to hide something.
It was one of those things.

8
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.390
It may not have been hostile.
I,
so I don't want you to quote me on that.

9
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.950
Then the house did a lot of those and that's what I'm saying.

10
00:00:29.951 --> 00:00:32.080
I might have been penthouse,
but I don't think it plays a lot.

11
00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:33.090
I think it was hustling,

12
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.000
but I could be wrong is one of the ones that people actually read.

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.560
Cause the girls never take their panties off.

14
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.520
So you get bored with just looking at what they do now though.

15
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.350
Didn't they go back to,
well they don't know they were,

16
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.120
they went [inaudible] all,
they did not do that at all.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

17
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.820
Show amazing will power.
Sorry.
Yay.
Um,

18
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.860
went to like bikinis or underwear.
They stopped taking their clothes off,

19
00:00:55.861 --> 00:01:00.810
but then sales inexplicably tank.
So strange.
There's articles.

20
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.980
Great.
They did have good articles,
did playboy interviews.

21
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.350
They had a lot of groundbreaking on it.
Goes to through the years,

22
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.610
had a book of all the different playboy interviews over the years.

23
00:01:11.611 --> 00:01:16.230
And I was like,
you probably have some good stuff.
Yeah.
So Randy,
yeah.
Randy.
Randy.

24
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.260
Yeah.
Writing for us law on an evangelist.
He said,
Hey,

25
00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:21.980
do you want to come see this Sif Angeles with me?
I'm like,
yeah,
sure,
I'll come.

26
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.550
So went there and um,
it's about 10,000 feet.
What's downtown?
Big Auditory.

27
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.110
And he was a huge auditorium.
You know,

28
00:01:28.111 --> 00:01:32.790
all these people sitting around and a pop off comes out on stage.

29
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.620
He starts saying he's getting the word of God.
He's telling people their names,

30
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.440
information,
who their doctors are,
what their ailments are.
And he's,

31
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.760
he started healing.
People have cancer.
He starts healing people live blindness.

32
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.120
People walk in again.
And it was really,
really emotional for me.

33
00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:50.000
I tears in my eyes,
but I knew that it was all bullshit,

34
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.480
but I had to news bullshit and he's still crying.

35
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.870
It get you get this whole fucking life.

36
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.440
Like when you see a little kid crying and running down the aisle,
you know you,

37
00:01:59.441 --> 00:02:03.210
you want to get angry,
but at the same time it's like,
it's just so emotional.

38
00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:06.150
It's just you get caught up in this whole thing.
He just do.

39
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.850
So he asked for people to collect money.

40
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.330
He's just asking random people to come up,
grab a bucket,
go collect money.

41
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.060
I got down there,
I mean when I was like the 15th bucket,
I got my bucket.

42
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.810
I walk around,
I get checks.
I got probably an album,
I don't know how much,

43
00:02:18.811 --> 00:02:21.810
10 grand,
20 grand,
I don't know.
You know what I've got,
I mean money.
First of all,

44
00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:24.690
getting money.
Then you've got to go.
I'm thinking I'm done.
He said,
nope.
Yeah,

45
00:02:24.691 --> 00:02:24.961
okay.

46
00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:28.110
Once you got to go back out and collect checks and how are we going out getting

47
00:02:28.111 --> 00:02:30.510
checks in the bucket.
Then it's like go out,

48
00:02:30.511 --> 00:02:33.270
get sealed offerings and people were dropping envelopes in there with like

49
00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:36.600
watches,
rings and stuff like that.
As I come back,

50
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.500
I hand the bucket up to pop off and I look up and I noticed that he's got a

51
00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:45.330
piece of plastic in his ear.
I go back to Randy and I say,
Randy,
I said,

52
00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:47.100
look,
either this man of God,

53
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.150
God doesn't like him enough to heal him and he's got a hearing aid or something

54
00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:52.770
else is going on.
I don't know what,

55
00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:55.700
but something else is going on and I think that's how he's getting information

56
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.420
and Randy was like,
no,
he's using the Marnix.

57
00:02:57.421 --> 00:03:00.400
Mnemonics are basically memory systems.
All right.
I you,

58
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:04.120
I have to use a lot of mnemonics to memorize things because otherwise I have

59
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.180
major issues and I know a lot about mnemonics.

60
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:08.950
You either memorize a lot about things,

61
00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:12.430
about a few things or you memorize a few things about a lot of things,

62
00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:15.700
but you don't memorize a lot of things about a lot of things.

63
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.190
And he was memorizing a lot of things about a lot of things.

64
00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:22.780
If that was the case,
I said,
I don't think so.
So they went out to the next pet,

65
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.570
pop off a congregation thing,
which was in San Francisco,
got a friend of Al's,
uh,

66
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.670
from uh,
Alec,
Jason,
I think his name is,
uh,
from uh,

67
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.080
who was an electronics engineer and that was everything about electronics.

68
00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:38.980
And he brought this little scanner and dressed up as a security guard hanging

69
00:03:38.981 --> 00:03:41.380
out in the back.
And he was scared to death.
He was going to get called.

70
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.460
Nobody questioned him.

71
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:46.240
He's there in a security outfit and he scans all the frequencies ahead of time

72
00:03:46.241 --> 00:03:49.810
and he blocks out every one of those frequencies that are known frequencies.

73
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.170
The moment pop off,
hits the stage,

74
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.260
a brand new frequency pops up and turns out,

75
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:03.490
I think it was a 37 point.
I can tell you in just a second here.
It was a,
yeah.

76
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.630
Was that the frequency that he was on was yeah,
I thought it was right.
Yeah.

77
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.540
39.7 megahertz.
That's what God broadcasts on.

78
00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:13.270
And it sounds an awful lot like Peter Popoff offs wife.

79
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.310
So what we did was we taped all this and went to the Johnny Carson show.

80
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:20.890
This is how long ago that was now on the tonight show with Johnny Carson.

81
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.600
Randy takes it on the tonight show and keep in mind that,
um,

82
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.700
pop off with tape every single one of his shows and sort of edit it real time as

83
00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:34.030
well.
You put them on television.
Yeah.
He would put them all on television.

84
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:37.660
The Sallie Mae,
you know,
tons of,
I mean,
they were,
they had a,
a monthly budget,

85
00:04:37.661 --> 00:04:42.370
I think it was like $550,000 every single month.
You know,
that's,
yeah.
That,
that,

86
00:04:42.371 --> 00:04:43.850
that,
that,
that was a working budget,

87
00:04:43.851 --> 00:04:45.450
that that's not the money they were actually making.

88
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.860
So God knows how much that's how much they were spending.

89
00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:49.720
That's how much they were spending.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

90
00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:53.380
So how would a dirty business,
yeah,
it's so dirty.

91
00:04:53.381 --> 00:04:55.690
It's so dirty to just lie to people like that.

92
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.950
I would make a great evangelists if I wasn't ethical.
There are times like,

93
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:02.950
Oh God,
you know,
but I just couldn't do it.
I couldn't do it.

94
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.300
So on the tonight show,
they play,

95
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.110
they play the footage that they have from his TV show,

96
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.850
they play all that and then they,
oh,

97
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.620
and this was the one time that Johnny always wanted to know everything that was

98
00:05:14.621 --> 00:05:17.650
going to happen.
They,
she didn't want any surprises,
but his staff said,
no,

99
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.070
you want to be surprised by this.
Trust us.
So sure enough,

100
00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:24.850
they play that footage and then they play the footage with pop offs wife and

101
00:05:24.851 --> 00:05:28.090
she's saying things like PD.
The first thing she says,
PD,

102
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.340
nod your head if you can hear me because if you don't,

103
00:05:30.341 --> 00:05:33.880
we're going to have trouble tonight.
He nods his head as he's talking,
you know,

104
00:05:33.881 --> 00:05:37.720
doing this whole event gelical thing.
Um,
and uh,

105
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.870
then she started saying,
oh,
there's a live one up in the back.

106
00:05:40.871 --> 00:05:43.520
She's got cancer in her breast and make her run up and down the island,

107
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.710
shake those breasts.
You know,

108
00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:47.500
it's just all these like re and there's a lot of nasty stuff.

109
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.830
Some of that stuff we couldn't play on this night show,
but we showed enough.

110
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.360
And so just a disdain the marketing of these people.

111
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.640
She actually had breast cancer and she's telling her that,
yeah,

112
00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.590
these people do these.
It's a real ailments that all these people,
well,

113
00:06:00.591 --> 00:06:03.240
almost real elements.
I'll get to that in a second.
Um,

114
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.490
cause we sent some stooges in and um,
so yeah,

115
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.370
just nasty,
nasty stuff.
But anyway,
the stuff we showed on the tonight show,

116
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:13.820
Johnny sits there and he never eaten,
didn't like to edit a shows either,

117
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.690
but he had to edit this because a moment that came on Johnny's like,
Oh shit.

118
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.310
And you couldn't say shit on TV back then.

119
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.280
And so we had to edit that out at that point.
And he says like,

120
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.370
do they know about this?
And like,
nope,
they do now.

121
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.930
And at first pop off,
try to say that we,
we,
we,
uh,

122
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.490
we hired actors to be his wife and then when it was obvious that we didn't,

123
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.810
he then came out and says,
I thought everybody knew that.

124
00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:38.150
I use that to enhance the word of God.

125
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.430
And it took a long time for him to go on to that.
Here's the,

126
00:06:42.431 --> 00:06:45.530
here's the crappy thing about this,
right when I was there,

127
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:49.130
he's doing stuff like telling people to throw their medications up on stage.

128
00:06:49.131 --> 00:06:51.290
You don't need them.
God's going to take care of,
you know,

129
00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.110
imagine somebody throws up some digitalis bills or something they really,

130
00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:55.970
truly need and think God's going to heal them.

131
00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:00.170
So people do die from these things.
And he was using a lot of other tricks like,

132
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.630
oh,
I'm,
part of the way he was getting the information was this,
right?

133
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.280
So people fill out prayer cards ahead of time and they put them in these boxes

134
00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:10.220
in the back of the room when nobody's really paying attention,

135
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:11.840
the boxes get switched out.

136
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.160
So all those prayer cards with all this information goes backstage to the wife

137
00:07:16.161 --> 00:07:19.190
and she's able to send that information to him.
Another thing,

138
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.830
she would come out on staff,
she would come out,

139
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.480
people come to these things to hours and hours ahead of time,
like literally,

140
00:07:23.481 --> 00:07:27.440
and they leave the hospital on carts and everything else.
And she would walk out,

141
00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.950
she'd say,
Hi Mrs Pop,
off we go.
I hope my husband gets to you tonight.
You know,

142
00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:33.620
where are you from?
Oh,
that's nice.
Why?
What's wrong with it?
Oh,
I'm so,

143
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.560
we'll all pray for you.
And she gets all this information again.
She'd go back,

144
00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:39.590
she had a big tape recorder in her purse and she would write that information

145
00:07:39.591 --> 00:07:43.850
down.
Another one was what I call like the Kathryn Kuhlman trick.
Uh,

146
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:47.480
and Catherine Coleman was an evangelist way,
way back,
who had all these great,

147
00:07:47.481 --> 00:07:49.430
great little like scam trick things.

148
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:54.790
And what they do is they wait for somebody to come walk in with a cane and then

149
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:57.350
they can walk but not well.
And they're using a cane.

150
00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.910
They walk up to them and say,
you know,
what?

151
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:00.980
Wouldn't you be much more comfortable in a wheelchair?

152
00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:03.350
And we put you up right up front,
you'll be right next to the reverend,

153
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.950
who's gonna say no to that.
So they get pushed up in the wheelchair.

154
00:08:06.951 --> 00:08:09.500
And as I push him along,
they said,
where are you from?
Who's your doctor?

155
00:08:09.501 --> 00:08:12.440
You know what's wrong with you getting all this information?
Go back out,

156
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:14.660
write the information down and give it misses pop off.

157
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.860
So the wheelchair sitting there,
reverend comes out.
At some point,

158
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.980
he can look at that person and he said,
so name.
And he says,

159
00:08:21.981 --> 00:08:25.040
we've never talked before.
We'd never met before,
have we?
Because they haven't.

160
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.880
It was the usher that was pushing him down.
The guy that didn't fall,
he says,

161
00:08:28.881 --> 00:08:30.890
you know,
God says you can be healed now.
God said,

162
00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:33.290
I'm getting from God that you can't walk.
Is that right?

163
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.560
And the guy is sitting there,
he's thinking,
this is a man of God,
right?

164
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:40.850
So I'm not contradicting him.
And he must mean everybody at a walk properly.

165
00:08:40.851 --> 00:08:42.020
Again,
that's what he's saying.

166
00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:44.240
He's saying that my doctor says I can never walk properly again.

167
00:08:44.241 --> 00:08:47.270
So he doesn't contradict him.
He says,
I say,
you can.

168
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:51.560
God says you can stand up.
The man stands up.
Well,

169
00:08:51.561 --> 00:08:53.570
that's your first miracle because everybody else,

170
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:57.900
their perception is this guy's in that wheelchair cannot walk.
He says,

171
00:08:57.901 --> 00:09:01.290
take a few steps.
Got It.
Takes a few steps.
He got that beat.
It's war,
right?

172
00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:03.000
So now you've got the emotion going even more,

173
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:04.560
because here's a man that couldn't even walk.

174
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.100
He stood and now he walked pop off,

175
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.670
then goes and gets in the wheelchair and sits in it.
He says,

176
00:09:11.671 --> 00:09:14.310
walk to the back of the wheelchair and the guy hobbles to the back of the

177
00:09:14.311 --> 00:09:18.630
wheelchair,
he says,
pushed me,
and the guy pushes them.
Real miracle,
right?

178
00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:21.630
But think about it.
That wheelchair is now acting like a fricking Walker,

179
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:22.440
you know?

180
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.620
And then the great climax of the whole piece of this trick is he takes her

181
00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:27.540
wheelchair,
puts it back where it is,
and he says to him,

182
00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:30.420
now that's your wheelchair.
Meaning Joe,
like if you got up right now,

183
00:09:30.421 --> 00:09:33.670
walked across the room and say,
Hey Joe,
that's your chair.
You'd say,
yes.
Well,

184
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.400
it actually is your chair.
You own it.
But I mean,

185
00:09:35.401 --> 00:09:38.340
in normal circumstances I say you were in my studio,
you'd go,
yes.

186
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:39.930
It doesn't mean it's your chair,

187
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.110
it just means it's where you're sitting in that moment,
right?

188
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.100
So the person sits down and you've seen this whole miracle.

189
00:09:45.101 --> 00:09:46.740
So he's got all these tricks like that,

190
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.140
the old trick of one leg longer than the other,

191
00:09:49.141 --> 00:09:51.090
and you make them both the same size.
Also,

192
00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:53.640
people get caught up in the moment and they're on television.

193
00:09:53.641 --> 00:09:57.330
They want it to be real and the they get,
I think that's in emotion.

194
00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.930
That's a lot of things.
Um,
but I don't think so.
In this case,

195
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.620
I think this is more of a religious thing that people truly believe.

196
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.500
And when you have,
it's like when I was talking in tongues,
when I was yelling,

197
00:10:07.501 --> 00:10:08.640
you know,
I've got all this stuff,

198
00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:10.630
me and I got all this adrenaline flowing through my body.

199
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.620
You get caught up in it.
It's like when I was watching it,
you know,

200
00:10:13.621 --> 00:10:16.860
I'm getting caught off.
I'm having all this reaction to my body despite the fact.

201
00:10:16.861 --> 00:10:21.090
I know it's all bullshit.
I'm still having this,
this entire reaction.
You know,

202
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.790
it's,
it's,
you know,
mediums I,
to me,

203
00:10:23.791 --> 00:10:27.270
the worst scum out there right now are the mediums.
And why did I say that?

204
00:10:27.271 --> 00:10:29.820
Because they're taking advantage of a person in a vulnerable moment in their

205
00:10:29.821 --> 00:10:33.300
life and they're doing it for that long game.
They're also doing it for money.

206
00:10:33.301 --> 00:10:38.250
And a lot of people will say,
well,
they're making them feel good.
You know what?

207
00:10:38.251 --> 00:10:41.130
I can give crack to a junkie.
It doesn't mean it's good for him,
right.

208
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:45.240
The grieving process is a natural part of the state that you have to go through

209
00:10:45.241 --> 00:10:49.470
to stay with the living.
We had a very good friend whose son died of cancer,

210
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:53.200
10 years old,
died of cancer.
She's understanding,
understandably,

211
00:10:53.201 --> 00:10:56.100
has this huge gaping hole,
right as huge gaping hole,

212
00:10:56.101 --> 00:10:59.430
which she's just feeling sad.
She's upset,
she needs to fill it with something.

213
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.570
Normally you turned to your family for those things,
but she met,

214
00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.690
she met a a medium who convinced the she could talk to her dead son.

215
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:09.180
So she stopped talking to her two living daughters.

216
00:11:09.181 --> 00:11:11.520
She stopped talking to her husband,
she started talking to the meat,

217
00:11:11.521 --> 00:11:14.130
even talking to her,
her dead son almost ended up with a divorce,

218
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.680
almost lost her entire life as a result,

219
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:21.630
and this happens all the time and it is so,
so sad and dirty people,

220
00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:26.310
very dirty people.
Long Island,
medium.
You Ever Watch Hotel Theresa Caputo?

221
00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:27.343
Yeah,

222
00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:32.550
and the worst part is the networks at edit the stuff to make it look even
better.

223
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:34.650
If they don't give a fuck up,
just trying to make money.

224
00:11:34.651 --> 00:11:36.220
It just trying to make money.
They that,
that's all.

225
00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:37.330
They don't care about this being,

226
00:11:37.331 --> 00:11:40.580
they somehow or another feel like they're not a part of the scam.
I mean they're,

227
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.740
they're literally committing fraud.
They aren't there.
No,
I agree.
They're,

228
00:11:43.741 --> 00:11:47.040
they're perpetrating the fraud.
Well,
the network's not involved with what it is,

229
00:11:47.041 --> 00:11:50.250
is a production company.
The production company is bringing it to the network,

230
00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:54.760
but the network should know the process and put it on,
knows what's going on.

231
00:11:54.761 --> 00:11:58.420
They know it's bullshit,
but it's like,
you know what?
I was going to get ratings.

232
00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:00.880
It's going to do this.
Let's promote it.
Let's push it.
You know,

233
00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:04.450
they shouldn't walk on set Onsi Fi and the network.

234
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:07.840
They didn't want me just debunking everything.
Nope.
And I had to tell them,

235
00:12:07.841 --> 00:12:10.180
I said,
the problem is everything's bullshit.
Yeah.

236
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.810
It's not that I'm trying to debunk everything,
we're just really looking at it.

237
00:12:13.811 --> 00:12:17.060
Yeah.
Everything's bullshit.
Way To why in my show I,

238
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.240
I started to go on this a little bit of going on that show telepathy where I

239
00:12:20.241 --> 00:12:23.530
talk about telepathy and what it is and everything else.
But as I'm doing it,

240
00:12:23.531 --> 00:12:27.910
I'm performing and there's a part in that show where I feel really,

241
00:12:27.911 --> 00:12:31.900
really dirty and I feel really,
really bad,
but I feel like I have to do it.

242
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.010
And I actually talked to some people's dead relatives in that show,

243
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.740
and it's like the most despicable,
horrible thing.

244
00:12:38.741 --> 00:12:40.690
And it makes me want to cry every time I do it.

245
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:44.620
But it's because in the second half of the show I go,
what is telepathy?
Well,

246
00:12:44.621 --> 00:12:48.490
I think I know what it is.
I think it's a,
a,
a subset of magic.

247
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.060
I think it's a form of entertainment and very cruel form of entertainment.

248
00:12:52.061 --> 00:12:54.520
I know I played with emotions.
If you,
any of you here this evening,

249
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:59.590
but how else can I convince you on an emotional level and on a logical level

250
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:02.230
that you can do is bullshit.
Because here's the thing,
right?

251
00:13:02.231 --> 00:13:03.064
It's like your friend,

252
00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:08.260
they've had this one experience that's an emotional experience meeting the

253
00:13:08.261 --> 00:13:11.170
psychic and the psychic telling them.
If you tell them,
hey,

254
00:13:11.171 --> 00:13:13.900
well I've got this friend vantage check that could do that same thing for you.

255
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.770
He's going to,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
but this is,
you know,
or if I do,
I hate to say Ben,

256
00:13:17.771 --> 00:13:21.580
a check is a real scifi tries to meet him and then I do it and he goes,
wow,

257
00:13:21.581 --> 00:13:23.770
that guy's real.
Then now you say it's bullshit.

258
00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.380
Now they'll think a little bit and go,
well,
you know what?

259
00:13:26.381 --> 00:13:30.250
I had that same emotional experience.
I had that same feeling.
Maybe,

260
00:13:30.251 --> 00:13:32.110
maybe I'll look at it.
My job,

261
00:13:32.111 --> 00:13:34.570
I feel he's never to break down a person's belief systems,
you know,

262
00:13:34.571 --> 00:13:36.550
you can believe whatever you want,
you know,
that's fine.

263
00:13:36.551 --> 00:13:39.790
So long as you're not hurting anybody else,
I'm Kinda sorta okay with it.

264
00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:41.170
But the big thing is,

265
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.620
the problem that I have is with the people that have taken advantage of those

266
00:13:44.621 --> 00:13:47.920
people's beliefs,
cause it's always than sheep's clothing.
