1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.380
Build the imagination.

2
00:00:01.381 --> 00:00:04.920
That's why when you read sounds of the lambs and you watched a movie,

3
00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:08.730
you got to get all everybody in that room and give them a big hug because they

4
00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:12.980
kept it honest.
They kept it real.
When you read William Blakely's,

5
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.820
the exegesis,
and then the excess is,
has been on for the last two weeks on AMC.

6
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.170
And I've been watching bits and pieces of it and I can't applaud it more,

7
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.480
you know,
it was fucking great.
That movie,
the priest,

8
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.490
that's Jackie Gleason son in law,
is it really?
Yes.
Who's Jason Stoll?
Who's Jason?

9
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.620
Whatever,
his father,
Jason,
whatever it was that he was in sleepers with,

10
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.210
uh,
with,
uh,
with,
uh,
Brad Pitt Deniro.

11
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.540
He played the newspaper reporter.
That's his fucking father.

12
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.040
But Damian Karras plays the priest.
That's Jackie Gleason,
his son in law.

13
00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:48.660
He married Jackie Gleason,
his daughter.

14
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.270
And it's been funny because last week I was in my office typing and my wife

15
00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:57.570
called,
she goes,
I'm gonna be home in 20 minutes with the baby,

16
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.380
so I don't know what you're doing.
Like,
all right,
so I want it the living room.

17
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.260
And I turned the TV on and just to be out there,

18
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.750
cause I know that you're going to want to watch cartoons or whatever,

19
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.530
and I saw the exorcisms on,

20
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.320
I turned it on and dog it came on when the priest comes to the door,

21
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.590
which if I have a bump into that director,

22
00:01:16.591 --> 00:01:21.540
I will take his dick out and suck it because that's what real directing is he

23
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:24.110
scheduled without showing you anything.
Yeah.

24
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.710
Remember when the priest comes to the door,

25
00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:29.130
all you see is an image from a priest and you don't want to see what his face

26
00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:33.420
looked like and it scares you.
But when he walks in,

27
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.650
he takes this motherfucker and the guy says to him,
can I get you something?

28
00:01:37.651 --> 00:01:41.550
How was your trip?
Can I get you something?
And he goes,
do you want some coffee?

29
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.710
And he goes,
no,
let's do this.

30
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.820
And this guy's a psychiatrist.
You have to watch the gun.

31
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.530
This guy's a psychiatrist.

32
00:01:49.531 --> 00:01:53.820
Not only is he a priest and he starts dropping and psycho and the priest looks

33
00:01:53.821 --> 00:01:57.300
over and goes,
knock it off.
The devil was cutting,
you know,

34
00:01:57.301 --> 00:02:00.930
tack your psychological like nobody else.
Do not listen to him.

35
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.710
And he just breaks it down.
And then the guy says to him,

36
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.660
do you want to know the three levels of manifestation?
And he looks at them.

37
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.350
He goes,
no,
there's only one saint Ignace,

38
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.250
same dog.
It's just right there.
You're like,

39
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.570
so my daughter walks in,
bots on the five year old,

40
00:02:21.571 --> 00:02:25.130
walks in and she sits on my lap and she's a Bible beater.

41
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.510
I don't know if you know this,
that mercy is a Bible beater.

42
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.360
She loves anything with God.
And you know,

43
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.800
I got a little fucking things she gave me with Jesus.
A fish.
Yeah,
mercy.

44
00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:38.730
My daughter's a Bible beating,
even though she goes to fucking public school,

45
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.040
she'll come home with Tom and they didn't talk about God to that.

46
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.520
So she's watching this whole manifestation of these two priests talking about

47
00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:50.830
God is powerful.
God is going to kill Satan,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.

48
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.270
And all of a sudden they walk into the room and she's sitting up and she's like,

49
00:02:56.401 --> 00:03:00.470
Eh,
my daughter it so good.

50
00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:05.471
Like 30 seconds to just look at me and she's just right out of the room like she

51
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:10.000
doesn't know who Satan is,
nothing.
She just ran out of the room.

52
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.860
This is one of the scariest movies,
one of the finest movies.

53
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.820
She elevates herself.
Calms down.
What about when they,

54
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.400
so they do the first thing they walk out.

55
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.950
And what about when they walked back in and he's a,

56
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.150
he's a doctor so he's checking her heart and she turns into the mother and the

57
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:32.760
hospital and start saying,
BME,
why you do this to me?
And,

58
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.300
and the priest told him,
don't listen to him.
That the devil's Connie,
you know,

59
00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:39.460
and all of a sudden,
what about when he comes in?
He goes,
father,

60
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.540
how about sparing five science from an all off the bar because the devil start.

61
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.230
I mean Bro,
you have to watch it and while all this is going on,

62
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.440
you have to remember that there's a murder going on because the first night when

63
00:03:52.601 --> 00:03:56.720
she came down,
before the devil came in and some guy was talking,
shit,
I'm not,

64
00:03:56.721 --> 00:03:58.360
fee was talking shit.

65
00:03:58.361 --> 00:04:01.930
A Jewish guy was talking shit about a Nazi or something and she comes down and

66
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:04.820
peas and says,
you're going to die motherfucker.

67
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.740
She just say gonna die up there to an astronaut,
wasn't it?

68
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.940
Wasn't he an astronaut?

69
00:04:09.941 --> 00:04:12.670
He was something downstairs and she said something like that,

70
00:04:12.671 --> 00:04:15.820
you're going to die up there.
No,
no.
He was downstairs.

71
00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:18.020
They were in the living room and they were singing and it didn't she,

72
00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.580
she was talking to a guy who was an astronaut and she just said,

73
00:04:21.581 --> 00:04:22.480
you're going to die.

74
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.790
And then she peed the car pass and then there was a dinner party and then a

75
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.620
couple of nights later they found the guy in the bottom of the stairs,

76
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.010
but it couldn't have been a girl because they twist with his neck all the way

77
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:33.844
around.

78
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.590
So it had to be a man and that's why you have to watch that movie when the cop

79
00:04:38.591 --> 00:04:41.410
comes to talk to her mother.
I was just famous actress.

80
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.760
The last time I watched it was like five or six years ago.
It's first of all,

81
00:04:45.761 --> 00:04:48.070
it's a deep,
dark moving.

82
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.260
That girl got fucked up doing that movie.
You know,
listen,

83
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.790
how can they make a 12 year old girl just took across my pussy?
I mean,

84
00:04:57.791 --> 00:05:01.450
let's talk about,
she started crossing the push.
He took it out,

85
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.090
grabbed her mother by the ears,
put her in such shock chocolate,
eat me like,

86
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.380
yeah,
all right.

87
00:05:08.381 --> 00:05:12.520
And then picked her up and smacks her and throws her across the fucking room.

88
00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:15.700
She says,
your mother's sucks Cox in the house.
After she told her one breaks,

89
00:05:15.701 --> 00:05:19.060
then you'd do I show that in the movie theater.
Shame on them.

90
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.540
Like if I could sue the union city cinema today,

91
00:05:22.541 --> 00:05:27.190
I was sued because they didn't check my id.
They didn't give a fuck.

92
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.910
They took my $2 and let me,
cause they threw me to the fucking wolf.

93
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.240
But I also saw,
what was her name again?
Linda Blair.

94
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.170
She showed up 20 years later she started hanging out with Rick James.

95
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.970
Um,
she,
she showed up 20 years later.
Richard,

96
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.160
I wonder what Linda Blair is doing today,

97
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.670
but I hope they paid her a lot of money because she never really recovered from

98
00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:50.890
that.
She never really worked after that.

99
00:05:50.891 --> 00:05:54.240
It's tough to get work after you put across from your pussy.
I mean,

100
00:05:54.241 --> 00:05:56.590
as Ginger Lynn,
I,

101
00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.950
it's tough to get to commercial for fucking bounce I,
yeah.

102
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:04.160
Well it's also people never forget you are that person.

103
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.210
Like it's very difficult for people to have a changed perception where she walks

104
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:10.550
down the stairs.
Yeah.
Backwards.

105
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.180
What about one of the head spins around in front of the priests?
I mean,

106
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.940
it's just too out there for a movie.
They could never,

107
00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.670
they think of remaking that every once in a while and they looked at each other.

108
00:06:20.671 --> 00:06:21.504
Look at it.

109
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:24.003
<v 1>Okay,</v>

110
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.270
<v 0>Jesus Christ.</v>

111
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.560
<v 2>That was a creepy fucking movie.</v>

112
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.630
And you kind of realize that back then there was nothing like this before this

113
00:06:34.631 --> 00:06:37.900
movie.
This movie was so extreme,

114
00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.970
like there had been horror movies before,

115
00:06:39.971 --> 00:06:44.200
but it was like Frankenstein or Dracula.
They were kind of scary,

116
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.370
but the warm bloody,
there was nothing like this movie.

117
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.120
This movie was so over the top and people,

118
00:06:52.121 --> 00:06:54.640
a lot of people at the time or like this,

119
00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:59.080
the movie represented something and represented a changing of boundaries that

120
00:06:59.081 --> 00:07:03.220
people,
these young kids,
these people today,
like what the fuck are they doing?

121
00:07:03.221 --> 00:07:04.230
What kind of movies of them?

122
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.960
<v 0>What is this?
I remember being,</v>

123
00:07:06.961 --> 00:07:11.570
I remember being in Catholic school and they would just piss there with Thomas

124
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.010
not to go see it.
We weren't allowed to go see it out,
bro.
That's,

125
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:21.890
I was right there when the movie got released and I had to see it and they you,

126
00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.690
you can't see it.
Yeah,
right.
You're going to see it blew my fucking,

127
00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.180
that's where I saw all rocky,

128
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.780
where everybody was on their feet yelling for rocky.

129
00:07:30.781 --> 00:07:32.510
This is what America was different.

130
00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:37.820
Every body was yelling rocky and they also saw the longest yard daddy original

131
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:43.530
and Eh,
this was a movie theater that was basically Irish,
Italian.
I'm Cuban,

132
00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:49.080
but they,
they talked,
they yelled at the screen,
you know,

133
00:07:49.081 --> 00:07:53.740
they threw things at the screen and when the fucking longest yard one for

134
00:07:53.741 --> 00:07:57.030
rentals was coming back,
the whole places on their feet.

135
00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:00.090
This is a great movie theater and they let you in that.

136
00:08:00.091 --> 00:08:03.800
Then they played the last movie at 1130 I just thought,

137
00:08:03.801 --> 00:08:06.960
you know how many times I just want to enter the dragon in that,
the late movie,

138
00:08:06.961 --> 00:08:11.370
my mother would let me walk up there cause it was on 48th street and my mother's

139
00:08:11.371 --> 00:08:13.400
ball was on 29th street and she'd go,
go to,

140
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.950
and I saw everything that fist of fury,

141
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:22.770
the outlaw Josey Wales,
all those fucking movies.
I saw that.

142
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.320
And even when they played,
I just go there as a Spanish kid,

143
00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.280
watch it and learn the language and loved it.
