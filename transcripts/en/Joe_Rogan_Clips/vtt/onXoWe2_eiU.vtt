1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.980
So enough.
Yeah,
I'm pretty good with pain.
Doesn't really bug me.

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.300
What about a edibles?
Haven't really done it.

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.130
You don't fuck with animals really?

4
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.950
I haven't had anything for 10 years.
Nothing,
nothing.
Zero.
No alcohol,

5
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.700
no weed,
no nothing.
Damn.
Yeah,
10 years,
which was a big,

6
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.200
well after my accident as well,
I was fed,
you know,

7
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:29.730
four months in a hospital being fed morphine every day for four months and then

8
00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:32.280
being on all these bipolar meds and everything else,

9
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.190
I honestly didn't want to put anything on my body when I got out.

10
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.340
I didn't even take painkillers when I got home.
Now.

11
00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:42.060
What kind of bipolar meds they put you on?
Dude,
I don't even remember.

12
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.170
I was on like four or five,
just bipolar and they,
I mean I had like,

13
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.060
I had so many,

14
00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:52.140
I probably had like 12 medications I got sent home with and I did it for about a

15
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.940
week or two and then I wouldn't see my doctor.

16
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.650
I had actually overheard one of my friends talking who was like a brother to me

17
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.710
and I had heard him talking to someone else and he was like,
Yo,

18
00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:05.130
like to Travis seems a little different,
you know,

19
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.540
like it seems a little bit slow or something.
And,
and I had overheard him.

20
00:01:09.541 --> 00:01:12.870
He didn't know I overheard him,
but I was,
these meds,

21
00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:15.720
I had been telling my docs too.
I was like,
I just don't feel like me.
I feel,

22
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.080
I don't know,
I feel weird and I just don't feel like myself.

23
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.560
So I just flushed them down the toilet one day and the next week I came back to

24
00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:24.030
see him and he's like,
how are you doing?
I said,
good,

25
00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:27.390
I'm off all of those meds you told me I'd be on for the rest of my life.

26
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.710
And they're like,
oh dude,
from what you've been through,
like you,
you,

27
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:34.320
it's okay to be on something like that.
And I was like,
yeah,

28
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.320
I'm doing fine though.
Like I don't need those,
you know?

29
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.470
And he said he wanted to put you on a,
because of the plane crash.
Yeah.

30
00:01:40.471 --> 00:01:42.360
They're like,
don't shame yourself,
you know,

31
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.860
by giving yourself a hard time that you have to take these pills.
And I said,

32
00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:48.330
well,
you know,
I honestly,

33
00:01:48.331 --> 00:01:50.220
I don't feel like they're doing what they're supposed to for me.

34
00:01:50.221 --> 00:01:53.070
And that actually happened like a negative effect on me,
so I don't,

35
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.490
I really don't want to take them.
You know,
they also told me I'd never run again.

36
00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:58.110
I'd never do this.
I never do that again.

37
00:01:58.111 --> 00:02:00.390
So I think I just got to the point where I was like,

38
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.550
let me see how many things I can prove otherwise that they've told me.
You know,

39
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.130
once I stopped taking the pills,
Jesus.

40
00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:12.480
So they put you on bipolar medication because of a traumatic crash?
Yeah,

41
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.100
that seems odd to me.
I mean,
I'm not a doctor obviously,
but,
well,

42
00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:18.810
I was kind of crazy,
you know,

43
00:02:18.811 --> 00:02:22.880
I was like suicidal when I was in the hospital.
Um,

44
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.020
I was on so many drugs I could even,

45
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.030
I didn't even know my friends had passed away.

46
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.800
I didn't even know the two pilots had passed away.
I didn't remember anything.

47
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.210
I kept thinking like everyone was in the hospital,
including the two pilots,

48
00:02:36.211 --> 00:02:40.380
including my two best friends and am I thought everyone was just in different

49
00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:45.150
rooms till about two weeks before I left.
And then I went crazy.

50
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.220
Then it was like they had a,
you know,
51 50 case on their hands.
You know,

51
00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:54.030
I wasn't,
I wasn't in a good place.
So yeah.
Then I did,

52
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.650
I did a lot of like post traumatic like therapy when I was in the hospital to

53
00:02:58.651 --> 00:03:03.580
kind of like calm things down.
Um,
once I got through all my surgeries and then,

54
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.960
yeah,
I mean,
over time it was,
it was cool,
but it was never cool,

55
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:12.100
but I started to feel better,
you know.
Um,
but yeah,

56
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.640
I think it was because I was so crazy at the time.
But that's,

57
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.600
it's interesting that,

58
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.720
<v 1>that I would think that bipolar medication would be something that you would</v>

59
00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:26.731
give someone who has like a condition that just is sort of pre predisposed to

60
00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:30.820
it.
Yeah.
I don't know anything about bipolar,

61
00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:34.780
but I would think that that's something that you just have,
you know,

62
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:36.850
it's like you have a mental condition.

63
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.510
I wouldn't think that it would be something that they would give you to overcome

64
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.680
a traumatic incident.

65
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.340
<v 0>Yeah.
I think they were afraid I was gonna be,</v>

66
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.700
I had like a mental condition after everything happened.
You know,

67
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.620
<v 1>they think like maybe because you're an artist that you're probably a little</v>

68
00:03:50.621 --> 00:03:51.454
crazy anyway.

69
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.770
<v 0>Possibly.
Yeah.
I mean,
yeah,
I think,
but I was a mess too.
Like,
you know,</v>

70
00:03:55.771 --> 00:03:59.230
like I had done,
I'd smoked so much weed,
you know,
every,

71
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.140
every day and I'd taken so many pills and I would self medicate quite a bit that

72
00:04:04.141 --> 00:04:08.250
I woke up probably out of 11 at my 30 surgeries I had in the burn center,

73
00:04:08.251 --> 00:04:10.140
I woke up swinging on doctors.

74
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.220
So it's because I would wake up and I would just,

75
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.910
I'd be opened up and I would just go crazy.
Jesus Christ.

76
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.880
So trying to get off the table.
Yeah.
I would just try to get off the table.

77
00:04:20.881 --> 00:04:24.750
I don't even think I really knew what was going on.
I just wasn't,

78
00:04:24.751 --> 00:04:28.050
they couldn't give me enough medication and knock me out cause I had been self

79
00:04:28.051 --> 00:04:32.370
medicating for so long and abusing meds for so long.
Wow.

80
00:04:32.371 --> 00:04:34.560
So you would get up from anesthesia,

81
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.750
you would just wake up in the middle of anesthesia.

82
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.600
So yeah,
that was,
that was a problem.

83
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.710
Um,
how did you clean up?
Um,

84
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.030
I think after that,
I think the last time I swung on a doctor,

85
00:04:51.031 --> 00:04:54.390
they were kinda like,
you,
you're not going to,
you can't be here no more.

86
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.490
And then I was like,
wow,
well I need x amount of more surgeries.
And I,

87
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.690
I really was just fighting demons.
You know,
I had just figured out,

88
00:05:03.691 --> 00:05:07.860
like my two best friends had passed away and the pilots had passed away and I

89
00:05:07.861 --> 00:05:11.310
was just like in an ugly place.
And,
um,
you know,
my,

90
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.720
my kids couldn't come visit me because 65% of my body was burnt,

91
00:05:15.721 --> 00:05:19.140
so I couldn't be around people.
So I was just in it,
man.
And then,
um,

92
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.730
and then I just,
I don't know.

93
00:05:20.731 --> 00:05:25.731
I turned a corner and then I was like a team player and I don't think I was on

94
00:05:25.921 --> 00:05:30.540
as many meds.
Most of my surgeries were over and just learning how to walk again.

95
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.220
Um,
being able to take a shower by myself again,
all that stuff,
man.
I,

96
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.000
I think that was just,
those are the good points that helped me turn the corner.

97
00:05:39.001 --> 00:05:43.350
And I don't know,
I just had more strength,
you know?
So.
Wow.

98
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.910
So you just just turned a corner in your mind and just sort of accepted it and,

99
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.090
yeah.
Same with drugs.
Like I didn't never do rehab or anything.

100
00:05:51.091 --> 00:05:55.140
I think it was mainly my kids and just a second life,

101
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.310
a second chance at life was enough for me.
I was like,
I don't,

102
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.250
I never want to do any of that stuff again,
you know?
That's cool.

103
00:06:01.251 --> 00:06:05.660
So once you get a certain amount of distance between you and those days,

104
00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:10.190
does it seem like,
like it wasn't even real,
it wasn't you doing those things,

105
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.910
you look back and you're just like,
fuck yeah,

106
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.160
I still talk to those doctors to this day.
Like Dr Grossman.
He's,
uh,
he's,

107
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.310
he's so awesome.
And he,
he basically saved my life,
you know.
Um,

108
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.880
but I still talk to him and he lives out here in the valley and he has Grossman

109
00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:30.410
burn center.
And I go over there at Christmas and,
and see burn,
you know,

110
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.090
burn victims that are over there in the,

111
00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:35.250
in the burn center and help out any way I can.
But yeah,
he's great man.

112
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.110
That's really cool.
Yeah.
Um,

113
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.500
many of my friends that I know that I had real bad drug problems and then now

114
00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:46.430
are off drugs,
they look back and they go,
what?
I don't,

115
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.130
what the fuck was I doing?
Like how did I do?
How was that me?

116
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.010
It's interesting how that happens in your life,

117
00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:54.200
who you have these new chapters in your life and,

118
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.860
and then sometimes it could just be something that happened like two weeks ago

119
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.280
and you're like,
who the fuck was that guy two weeks ago?

120
00:07:01.281 --> 00:07:02.600
I'm not even him anymore.
Yeah.
