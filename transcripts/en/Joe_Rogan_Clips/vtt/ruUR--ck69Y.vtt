1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.440
Because I like that feeling at night when I listen to music,

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.100
I'm a big music,
like I was not,

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.400
I called you like it was like October 3rd and I was in the call you to tell you

4
00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:16.260
that I love to participate in sober October,
but because of my love for music,

5
00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:20.130
it's not going to happen because my thing is to go home at night or sometimes I

6
00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:21.060
go to the office.

7
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.250
Like I told you my house is dead at 20 to nine the kid goes to bed at fucking

8
00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:28.560
eight dirty and my wife's in bed 10 minutes later.

9
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.880
So some nights I don't have a spot on a podcast.
I just go to my office,

10
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.680
I bring a notebook on an Ipad,
get stoned and I put it in the whole of the album.

11
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.510
My and I go down the album road and I just get fucked up and listen to that

12
00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:44.950
music.
I love the chat row.
That's my mommy.

13
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.290
And once a week I go to the album store and I buy in a while.

14
00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:52.740
I'm a new vinyl album.
Lately,
I would not let a led Zeppelin and two road,

15
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.050
that's one of the greatest,

16
00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.500
dirtiest still CSR and it opens up with a whole lot of love.

17
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.370
It's just dirty.
And then with weapons song and then the heartbreak,

18
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.820
it's just dirty.

19
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.870
And then I've been listening to fucking physical graffiti.

20
00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:15.910
I loved going into those foxholes way that night.
Stone.

21
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.530
Yeah,
there's something about that music.
They,

22
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.550
they were the first drug culture music in America,

23
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.020
right?
If you think about it,

24
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.920
like Zeppelin and pink Floyd showed up and they went to India,

25
00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:36.960
they grew long hair and they came back with those four outcomes.

26
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.970
Then there was rumors of acid.
If you listen to the,
you know,

27
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.440
one revolve.
I think it's evolved.
One of those John Lennon spreads,

28
00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:49.630
acid bond.
That was it.
I mean there's a,

29
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.650
there's a lot of musicians from that era that are great that aren't associated

30
00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:55.770
with drugs.
But if you think of Hendrix,
if you think of,

31
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.320
I mean Hendricks was always associated with drugs.

32
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.990
Janis Joplin always associated with trucks.

33
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.660
<v 1>Okay.</v>

34
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.980
<v 0>You know,
good or bad.
It's,
it's very interesting.
It's very interesting.</v>

35
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.070
The sound is so it lasts like it's so relevant.

36
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.300
If you listen to some Zeplin today,
it's still so God damn good.

37
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.750
They were so good.
They were so good.

38
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.360
Zeplin too called bring it on home at the end he comes out like with a harmonica

39
00:02:26.571 --> 00:02:31.370
slow.
Then Jimmy page kicks him with the guitar.
Y'All got to stop.
Yeah,

40
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.740
like now it's like you're like,
I should do,

41
00:02:33.741 --> 00:02:37.700
I jump out a window like legs up when the two,
there's a couple of albums.

42
00:02:37.701 --> 00:02:41.930
I got metal office that I put on such a part of my childhood.

43
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.940
I think about my mom coming into the room saying yelling lower that fucking

44
00:02:46.941 --> 00:02:50.400
devil music.
You know what I'm saying?
Weight bias.
I moved,

45
00:02:50.401 --> 00:02:55.220
she got up on it and I would blast it at fucking six in the morning.

46
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:56.270
Oh,

47
00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.640
the neighbors next door with Jehovah witnesses and he would knock on my door.

48
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:04.030
You have to please lower your immune music.
I would never load it.
Lowered it.

49
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.500
At that age I had a fissure stereo.
Okay.

50
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:12.400
And I already knew not to get components like I was already hit.
Like,

51
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:16.660
I never bought the album with the eight track and the cassette.
Fuck you.

52
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.500
I bought an amp and I bought on a cassette deck and I had a turntable and I

53
00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:28.200
would fucking blasted.
I Dunno where I got the speakers from my bottom.

54
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.150
They fell off a truck.
I love music.
Loud.
My,

55
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.630
my eye storm every time till this day,

56
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.740
every time led Zepplin final album comes out.
Um,
you know,

57
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.050
into the outdoor comes on the radio or something.

58
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.560
I think of my mother banging on the door freshman year ago and if I got a knock

59
00:03:46.961 --> 00:03:48.160
on this door one more time,

60
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:52.450
I'm throwing that scenario out the window like seven in the morning.

61
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.300
How does that full fucking speed.
Rolling joy,

62
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.000
getting ready to walk up the hill,
smoking a joint.
I wouldn't smoke at the house.

63
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.650
Nothing like that.
She had no idea.

64
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.350
You playing the album albums with a record player.

65
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.840
Fuck.
And I still get what you don't do.
You have a good needle.

66
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.960
Remember you'd go over due to houses.
They had a special needle.

67
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.960
I let you go to NATO.
I just went and got new needles.

68
00:04:16.961 --> 00:04:21.660
I haven't had an order of my mind.
Fucking impressive a guy.
And I'm like,

69
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.970
I'm fucking cool looking needle.
I still had,

70
00:04:24.971 --> 00:04:27.130
I had a friend that had a reel to reel Jimmy.

71
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.830
I had a record player at my house for sure.
Wow.
You gotta reel to reel.

72
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.750
I friend of mine had a real,
a real high school.
Oh my God.
And the sound,

73
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.060
he bought the speakers and everything.
He's a sound.

74
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.090
You could hear like the musician pulling away from the microphone like Sam was

75
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:49.960
that good.
So when he's playing this reel,
the reel,
it's got like a,

76
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.610
like a projector screen type deal.
No,
he was,

77
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.110
he had a room like this and uh,

78
00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.420
he had a shelf and on the shelf he had speakers and he had a reel to reel.

79
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:01.803
I think I've,

80
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.850
he was connected and it would have two or three hours of music on it.

81
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.720
So whenever he would have a party,
he would just put on the reel to reel.

82
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.030
At that time,
that was the threat that it's going to reel the reel.

83
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.690
That's another thing I projected.
Right.
It's going to reel the reel.

84
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:23.170
That's the new threat that never made it.
It then went from,

85
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.200
it went from albums to cassettes to fucking cds.

86
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.880
So if you put something through that,

87
00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:33.850
you would have to kind of like do it like you were working in the projection

88
00:05:33.851 --> 00:05:37.510
room.
You take the from one of them and it works on,

89
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.060
my sense is just really large cassette tape player.

90
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.450
I just forget how he put the music on there.

91
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.950
I forget how he put the music on that.
Could you buy me?
He's a god,
I think so.
It,

92
00:05:46.951 --> 00:05:48.640
that's the record button on this too.
It looks like.

93
00:05:48.641 --> 00:05:51.760
So you could have recorded something on there if you had a cable to plug it in.
