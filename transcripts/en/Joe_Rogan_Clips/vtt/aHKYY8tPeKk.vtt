00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.380
Her low freak bitches.
It's God's side job,

2
00:00:04.381 --> 00:00:07.470
fucking children because that's not whatever it is.
It's not working,

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.170
but we forgive them.
We will.
It's not all bad.

4
00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:13.590
We don't want to break the whole thing up.
Definitely don't want to do that.
No,

5
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:18.360
stealing is not that fucking a kid is the same as like some minor bullshit

6
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:22.470
infraction and society and thousands,
thousands of cases,

7
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:24.090
maybe even millions of cases.

8
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:28.020
It's and then still you have these world leaders like Trump met with the pope.

9
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.210
The pope was all bummed out.
Trump should be like,

10
00:00:30.211 --> 00:00:33.420
I'm bummed out to be next to you,
motherfucker.
You represent.

11
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.060
You're mad at me cause I'm pulling out of the climate accord.

12
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.670
What about all the kid fucking bro,

13
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.910
you should bring up the kid fucking he's been fucking kids.
Oh that's right.

14
00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:45.150
You do a good Trump.
Have you seen the pictures of Trump with the pope?

15
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.770
You have to get hopes.
Totally disenchanted.
Rail bumped pope should relax.

16
00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:53.150
He should slow his fucking role.
You're part of a giant kid fucking ring yet.

17
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.200
Who Do you think you are?
Right?

18
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.740
You're getting cocky because the billionaire guy who tricked American to voting

19
00:00:57.741 --> 00:00:59.400
for him,
he's uncomfortable.

20
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.730
Do you know what the thing that bothers me the most is the church is all about

21
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.230
fucking the community and the people.

22
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.170
They don't pay taxes on all this great real estate.
They own tons of it.

23
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.260
How come they can't house homeless people or sick people in those churches all

24
00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:13.080
day long while they're there?
That's free property.
Yeah.
I don't understand.

25
00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:17.130
There it is.
Yeah.
This trumps like my hair looks good.

26
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.600
Good hair day.
It's a good hair day puppy.

27
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.790
Like my hair touch it real.
I got a dead.

28
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.430
The guy that I used went to Tony and guy the hairstylist school.

29
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.520
The color of his hair is like the color of every retired Florida Golfer in his

30
00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:37.170
70 [inaudible] fucking so gross.
He's got this weird blonde grey thing going on.

31
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.060
It's like he moves it around a little,

32
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:43.560
like some days it's like a darker Brown Sundays.
It's like a blog,
like blonde,

33
00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:47.250
grey.
It looks,
it's just like sand.
He's getting it worked on is what I'm saying.

34
00:01:47.251 --> 00:01:50.970
Like this is not the color of the hair.
Now you do one of two things.

35
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.020
Let me be clear about this.

36
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.740
Either you work on your hair or you don't work on your hair.
Okay,

37
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:59.520
so either you die your fucking hair or you don't dye your hair.

38
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.750
It's one of those two things.
How fucking when you dye your hair be consistent.

39
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.190
You can't go gray and then be blonde again and be dark haired.

40
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.810
It's too confusing to me.

41
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.320
I need to know what kind of a person are you like how much you working on your

42
00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:15.750
hair?
What's your level of haircare?

43
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.380
How much time you spending putting that together every day?
It does.

44
00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:21.840
Did Donald Trump changes?
Herrick?
Of course.
It was like an obvious.

45
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.620
Of course he did.
He's changed his hair color.
It goes.
He's moving it around.

46
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.610
Just keep moving though.
You don't,
you know,

47
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.510
just talking too much and not moving and I'll do it.
Yeah.

48
00:02:30.511 --> 00:02:33.540
There's not enough happening here.
This complaining about other things happening.

49
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.760
I get it again,
it,
it's not good.

50
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.060
The climate change agreement is a terrible thing to leave.

51
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.140
It's a bad thing to leave his own daughter told them not to leave,

52
00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:48.030
but I never liked Chris and so we got to get out of Paris.
She did.

53
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.050
She has owned his own daughter was like,
this is a bad idea.
This guy's crazy.

54
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.130
He just,
when he is in science,
he is perfectly out of his fucking mind.

55
00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.070
He's going against science.
Like the scientists are saying,
Hey,

56
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.270
we've got to reduce emissions hundred percent we're polluting the air.

57
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:09.190
We breathe.
We're ruining the very air that we need to exist on.

58
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.720
Yup.
Now that's true.
Don't agree.
We buy,
we bought new air.

59
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.840
There's show by chair.
Have you ever seen how much air there is?

60
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.180
Maybe he's doing this because he's about to move.

61
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.250
Move into position to use one of those gigantic building sized air filter

62
00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:24.551
things.

63
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:27.760
Maybe it's going to have a Trump air filter filters and set them up in every

64
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:28.594
city.

65
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.650
You could all go back and buy diesel trucks and no one's going to care anymore.

66
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.820
We're going to clean that air.
Nice.

67
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.620
<v 1>Okay.</v>
