Hello Freak bitches.
I think it's a great idea,

2
00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:07.020
but I think the world is being starved from a Charlie Murphy TV show.

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.660
That's what I'm saying.
So when he used to follow you.
Yeah,
we got that,

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.870
we got that and we also got the other show I'm doing and the thing is going to

5
00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:16.930
be rich,
fallen asleep,
but

6
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.900
there was the whole digital thing.
We get ready to build up,

7
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.840
you know when it's going to be a camera,
the whole digital thing.
Yeah.

8
00:00:25.841 --> 00:00:28.740
We get married.
Only a man such as Charlie Murphy can get away with saying that,

9
00:00:28.741 --> 00:00:31.620
you know the whole digital thing.
That's your thing that's going on right now.

10
00:00:31.621 --> 00:00:35.040
You open that up,
you build up my whole digital department of,
you know my,

11
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.170
didn't you start a podcast?
I am.
That's all them.

12
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.720
All in the makings.
But I only could do one thing at a time.

13
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.080
And what I was focusing on this year was writing that movie.

14
00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:49.210
I just finished writing and you know,
getting ready to do the TV show.

15
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.100
I we were doing 20 episodes over the next six weeks.
Wow.

16
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.790
I'm focusing on those two things and once that's done,
boom,

17
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.120
then it's onto the next,
then the next area.
I'm not,

18
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.300
I don't sit back on my hunches at all.
Definitely not.
You got DVDs,

19
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:07.080
books and movies,
everything.
And then you got to your website where the wife man.

20
00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:10.480
Yeah.
I keep working hard.
I'll have one eventually.
You know,

21
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.790
it said it's kind of be hard to marry after your wife dies.
What does it feel?

22
00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:19.230
It's not going to be hard to marry.
It's hard to be single,
right?
Being single.

23
00:01:19.231 --> 00:01:22.440
It sucks,
man.
It doesn't,
especially if you get kids,

24
00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:26.430
because like I have to sneak the APP stacks,
man.

25
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.640
Come on man.
You go through that when you were in high school,
but if you,

26
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.830
if you're,
if you're a person that you're married to,

27
00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:38.260
happens to pass away or whatever,
you can't bring chicks around and bone them.

28
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.030
You can't do that man.
Especially not being filed or your lab slip.

29
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.890
You can't sneak them up sitting room,
any of that.

30
00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:46.470
Because when they come in and if you have a daughter,
she's going to go,
Hey,
what?

31
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.080
Who?
Who was that?
That's so my daughter.

32
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.850
Then she goes right over to the person and start monopolizing them.
Who are you?

33
00:01:53.851 --> 00:01:55.830
What are you doing here?
And she makes sure,

34
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.240
so you're having a sleep over and no she's not.
So you have to sneak.

35
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.340
Yeah man.
Being singles know after you were married for years is wack.
Well,

36
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.410
I was married for years,
so I want to be,
you know,
the lifestyle,

37
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.530
you know,
my wife is gone,
but the lifestyle,
yeah,
I missed that man.

38
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.680
Definitely being single sucks.
Make single checks.
Don't cook for you.

39
00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:21.720
You don't want them to cook.
You don't even trust them.

40
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.910
Especially if they suggest to you is exactly what spaghetti and no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

41
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.930
You can't.
You know,

42
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.740
you got to be married to trust them,
to enjoy those things.

43
00:02:33.741 --> 00:02:35.730
It's also got be hard when you're on the road,

44
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.440
you know you're on the road constantly.

45
00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:40.140
It's hard to spend time with someone to get to know them.

46
00:02:40.141 --> 00:02:42.720
Once you take them with you and you can't take somebody with you,

47
00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:46.140
they have their own life going on.
And if you say,
come with me,

48
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.940
you get basically saying quit your job,

49
00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:52.880
but I'm not telling no one to quit the job.
Quit your job and come with me.
Oh No,

50
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.090
I'm not doing that.
So it's hard man.
Especially when you barely know them,

51
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.040
you know,
cause that's really what it is until live with someone.
You

52
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.040
<v 1>don't really don't know him that well.
You do,
but you don't.
You don't,</v>

53
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.830
you don't live with them.
That's a key part.

54
00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:10.540
And that's when they can get to know you talking about a year of living with

55
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:13.140
someone,
I mean living with someone,
do you got,

56
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.860
you got to say at least three years cause something's going to have three years

57
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:22.720
is a good time [inaudible] at some point.
Right,
right,
right.

58
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.000
<v 0>Hmm.
Did you get to know the person?
Yeah.
So you know,
that's,
that's like my,</v>

59
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.970
that's the paradox in my life right now.
You know,
people were looking go ease,

60
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.631
everyone likes him,

61
00:03:33.631 --> 00:03:37.320
he's doing great in his business and then it's show business and blah blah blah.

62
00:03:37.321 --> 00:03:42.120
Yes,
that's good.
But that's not real life.
That's a job.
A real lag is my family.

63
00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:45.360
My real life is when you come home at night with lights go off,

64
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.510
you ain't on stage and that's the part where there's you go,

65
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.030
there's a big hole because my wife is gone and it's not as simple as one would

66
00:03:54.031 --> 00:03:57.960
think,
oh,
it's hard.
It's harder than you would think.

67
00:03:57.961 --> 00:04:01.830
As far as friends,
somebody to to fill in that area.

68
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.030
Of course there's plenty of people would say,
oh,
I would do it outcome,

69
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.820
but it's not the person you want.
You have to be very careful.

70
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.300
You have around the children.
Yeah,
man.
Oh,
I want to slap a few of these checks.

71
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.190
Okay.
How can I move in with you and take care of your children?
Really you will.

72
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.430
You you a horror.
The horror.

73
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.780
<v 1>What are you guys with that horror,
horror,</v>

74
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.180
horror or woman who was at the best of just getting confused by the accent?

75
00:04:33.181 --> 00:04:37.120
I thought it was an inside joke that I was missing out on
the

76
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.060
tuition for your brother and while you're actually touring as a comedian,

77
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.060
that's gotta be really hard.

78
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.000
<v 0>Yeah.
Meg.
Nick says,
I got my kids with me out of here,
man.</v>

79
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.420
I got my son son's in your living room right now.
Yeah,

80
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.400
I got my kids out here with me right in there and you know,

81
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.150
schools giving a start,
so they're going to be with me till September.

82
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.660
[inaudible] taking them back home,
hanging out with him that week.

83
00:04:57.661 --> 00:05:02.080
School starts then you know that that was back when we get got to New Jersey.

84
00:05:02.081 --> 00:05:04.770
That's than just,
you're still in the live in New Jersey and Pennsylvania too.

85
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.100
But this was in Philly last weekend,
man.
Yeah.
I live in,
have a of Strausberg.

86
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.400
No,
but I'm just saying once that goes back into effect,

87
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.090
I'm still going to be coming.
I gotta come back out of here,
work on the show.

88
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.750
I got to go to Europe.
I got to go to Cuba.
Just said it's the jar Rahab,

89
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.440
so I can't complain.
I'm glad I had the job.

90
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.100
But that's the part of it that the fact that their mother is that here.

91
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.540
That makes it really rough.
Yeah.
Automatic.

92
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.990
If I was leaving you with your mom was I wasn't even,
I bet.
Yeah,
that's right.

93
00:05:36.991 --> 00:05:39.950
I'm not leaving with you.
What's your mom's leaving you with nannies,
right.

94
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.800
You know what I'm saying?

95
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.500
Cause my whole family lives out here on the west coast or whatever.

96
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.640
And because I'm at the kind of person that leans on people like that,

97
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.120
I appreciate your help,
but I'm going to ask them for it.

98
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.240
And if you don't offer it,
I'm,
I'm not going to complain about it.

99
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.960
I'd do it myself.
Yep.
And that's how I raised kids.
You know what I'm saying?

100
00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.640
I got paid,
my name's,
I don't ask somebody to help me out.

101
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.680
I'll do what I gotta do.
But at the same time,

102
00:06:03.681 --> 00:06:07.640
there's a feeling that goes along with that and don't feel good,
you know,

103
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.030
as do you do like video conferencing with your kids.

104
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.540
You try to do as much as possible and Skype and all that.
But that's good.

105
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.420
You know what I'm saying?
My kids young man,
I got a five year old daughter,

106
00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:20.720
you know,
and I just don't want this.

107
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.150
The thing you do is to support them and be the thing that,
that,
uh,
uh,

108
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.730
disables them.
I'm like,
when they grow up,
Yay.
My father was never home.

109
00:06:28.731 --> 00:06:32.200
He was always working and blah,
blah,
blah.
And that's the reason why,
you know,

110
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.100
my life went this way.
That's my fear.
You know,
I work with that one constantly.

111
00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:39.350
You know,
that's the fear of every father.

112
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.880
How much time can you spend in doing what you want to do for a living?

113
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.130
The more your kids man,
cause if you don't do it,
he's getting moldy,

114
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.270
moldy or whatever.
You don't teach him,
he's going to learn somewhere else.

115
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.070
You know?
And it may be,
you know,
warped sense of,
uh,
like me for instance,

116
00:06:55.071 --> 00:06:59.630
when I was growing up,
you know,
my dad was always at work always.

117
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.730
I was seeing one day a week Saturday.
And usually that wasn't,
you know,

118
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.130
to be next to it.
That's what you was getting your ass whipped for,

119
00:07:07.131 --> 00:07:09.620
what you did during,
during the week.
You know what I'm saying?
Yes.

120
00:07:09.621 --> 00:07:14.390
When you dad showed up to whip your ass and sanity.
As a result.

121
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.280
When I grew up and became a man,
when it came time for me to deal with women,

122
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:25.280
I learned how to deal with women by listening to guys that were in the street

123
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.710
bombs,
guys,
nick t-bones,

124
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:32.090
slick and big and whatever.
And because of that,

125
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.040
the first couple of relationships I had with women,
I was abusive.
Dude,
man,

126
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.280
I would think of think what you're talking back to me.

127
00:07:40.281 --> 00:07:43.730
The answers I'm supposed to hit you because that's what slick told me.

128
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.950
That's not doing what you're supposed to do.

129
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.220
If your dad is there to teach you that,
you know better.

130
00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:50.700
But if you don't grow up with that around,

131
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.940
grew up with something else because you're going to be seeking analogy.
You Go,

132
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.120
you go out and do the wrong thing.
You know?

133
00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.540
So that's what I think about what my kids that I want to,

134
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:01.360
you want to be at and make sure you did it.

135
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.080
Just deliver all the lessons they need.

136
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:08.210
But then when you go to half my team is gone.
Is that not to do about that?

137
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.250
It makes it real scary,
especially when you start looking at,
well,

138
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.340
all the people who are talking about,
they want to be the replacement.

139
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.140
You must be out of your mind.
You think I'm a bring you,

140
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:25.100
bring you around.
I mean,
our relationship is fine over here,

141
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:28.610
but do you think it would bring you,
I think we found the show.

142
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:33.460
This is the show,
this show,
the show was doing.
So Comma,

143
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:36.110
and what's really fucking going on in your life now?
Well,
that's why,

144
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.950
that's why the show I'm doing,
it's not the adopted son.

145
00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:45.080
Exactly.
See me,
my kids,
man.
Right.
And I'm,
I'm single.

146
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:50.150
I'm going to have the same challenges as I have in my real life and I could

147
00:08:50.151 --> 00:08:54.340
definitely bring it,
uh,
uh,
experience.
Do you bring,

148
00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:59.430
do you ever,
do you ever have done it?
But my kids don't.
Kids don't like to,

149
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.810
uh,
be at work with you.
Right.
You know,

150
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:07.060
for no longer than five minutes.
When they get there,
they check it out,
but okay,

151
00:09:07.061 --> 00:09:09.990
then where's the toys that,
where is my world?
Right,
right,
right.

152
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.040
Where's the kitty things?

153
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:15.240
So I had my kids with me on the road when their mom mom was alive,

154
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.740
but since she's passed away,
I haven't had them with me because I'm a horrible,

155
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.730
uh,
uh,
fun buddy for a kid.

156
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:28.050
We go to Seattle.
Oh,
let's go,
let's go check out to dinner.

157
00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:30.300
Then I'll be in the room,
go,
well if I go there,

158
00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:35.010
I'm going to have to sign autographs and take pictures.

159
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:39.450
I'm not going to be able to do it the way you guys.
So it's gone.
It's gone.

160
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.380
You don't go to just like go to Disneyland.
I have to go on certain days,
man.

161
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:45.630
You know what I'm saying?
I don't go when it's,
when it's peak,

162
00:09:45.631 --> 00:09:50.190
you know everybody's dead because then I become goofy or,
or,
or,
or Mickey Mouse.

163
00:09:50.191 --> 00:09:53.480
You know what I'm saying?
To the people who came here on vacation,
you know,

164
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.430
you have the day we were staying on a vine on 17,

165
00:09:56.431 --> 00:09:59.280
17 branch resort hotel called the Red Berry.
Right.

166
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.800
It's right on the walk of fame and all that.

167
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:06.180
My kids in the hotel looking out the balcony,
we want to go for a walk.

168
00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:08.060
And I said,
okay,
you can go for a walk with the nanny.

169
00:10:08.061 --> 00:10:13.061
It's no way I want to walk on the walk of fame in broad daylight with my kids.

170
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.280
And I know that that's a tourist attractions.
People on buses,
you know,

171
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.140
driving around here,
the tour buses,

172
00:10:19.141 --> 00:10:21.300
driving around on star searches or what have you.

173
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.860
And if you from Kansas or wherever you may be from him and you go to Hollywood

174
00:10:25.861 --> 00:10:28.410
and you see someone you've seen on television,
when are you going to do,

175
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.920
you're going to go crazy and you should.
So that's why I was like,

176
00:10:31.921 --> 00:10:35.160
you better stay in your room because if you go down there with your kids it's

177
00:10:35.161 --> 00:10:38.280
not going to be,
have you ever thought about it like disguises,
like blonde way?

178
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.200
Absolutely not.
I refused

179
00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.180
the blue.
That actually happened.
Patrick Stewart,
they brand new,

180
00:10:48.181 --> 00:10:52.830
they Patrick's Day parade a week before that,

181
00:10:52.831 --> 00:10:55.320
it was a blackout in my town,

182
00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.170
had lost power at my house for like a week,

183
00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.240
staying in New York and the London hotel.

184
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.050
So Saint Patrick's Day was during and we got it.
I wasn't,

185
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.750
I'm an Irish even though my name is Murphy,
I don't,

186
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.930
and I'll be aware of when Saint Patrick's Day is coming up,
you know,

187
00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:14.310
so last name is Rogan and I don't know why it's coming up.
I walked outside with,

188
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:14.641
you know,

189
00:11:14.641 --> 00:11:17.960
my two kids and he was walking around Manhattan supposedly going to walk over to

190
00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:22.190
central park and I see all the Hoopla and fit man.
And I'm like,
Oh,

191
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:26.840
it's St Patrick's Day.
Do you kids want to go to the Saint Patrick's Day parade?

192
00:11:26.841 --> 00:11:30.720
And it's like,
Yeah Daddy.
Because they had never been.
I walked him,

193
00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:33.780
just me and my two kids,
man.
I walked him up to the crowd,

194
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.180
put my daughter on my shoulder and we were watching the parade and heard

195
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:42.810
somebody go,
Yo,
that's Charlie Murphy,
Yo,

196
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:46.170
that's Charlie Murphy.
Then it started from this side,

197
00:11:46.171 --> 00:11:49.170
the left and the right and then you see the people looking at you and they're

198
00:11:49.171 --> 00:11:52.140
coming forward.
And my daughter started screaming,
man,

199
00:11:52.141 --> 00:11:55.850
because it was a lot of people and they had expressed,
pressed on the wall,

200
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.900
the building
screaming,

201
00:11:58.901 --> 00:12:02.650
and my daughter's screaming from fear,
man,
I'm holding my son's arm.

202
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.940
And it had to just turn it to like an animal man.

203
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:11.490
Get the f out of here.
This just push through the crowd and I look my kids,
man,

204
00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:13.480
and as I'm doing it,
I'm going,
you're an idiot.

205
00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.980
What made you think that you could stand on fifth avenue in,

206
00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:22.570
in broad daylight on Saint Patrick's day and of crowd,
which the children,

207
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.860
and that was the safe thing to do,
but I forgot for that one split second.

208
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:31.810
What I do full live,
it came,
you know what I'm saying?
It can't make the bay me.

209
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:35.110
There's
blonde wig.
