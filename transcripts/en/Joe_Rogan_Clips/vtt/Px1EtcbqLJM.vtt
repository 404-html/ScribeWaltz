WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.440
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.720
<v 1>Let's get into,
we,
we briefly touched on weight cutting,</v>

3
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.240
but I know that the UFC has recognized that there's,
there's a real issue and um,

4
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.290
what steps have we taken to try to mitigate the problems that are caused by

5
00:00:17.291 --> 00:00:18.520
weight cutting?
Yeah,

6
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.270
it was interesting and another one of the reasons why I love the performance

7
00:00:22.271 --> 00:00:25.300
institute and the staff that we had there and that before them.

8
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.050
And it really stemmed from the Usada program where under the water code you ban

9
00:00:30.051 --> 00:00:32.020
the use of Ivs.
And so,

10
00:00:32.021 --> 00:00:36.050
cause I was kind of the point person obviously explained why ivs or problem,

11
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.940
it goes back to the,
to the cyclists.

12
00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:42.941
They were using ivs to basically flush their system of drugs to manipulate their

13
00:00:43.151 --> 00:00:44.890
bicycle biological passport.

14
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.420
So if is blood doping or using EPO and um,

15
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.190
it would have a tendency to lower those and,

16
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.860
and normalize those biological passport levels.

17
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.670
And so lot to learn that through some of the investigations that,
you know,

18
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.700
there were conducted and determined that ivy use in excess of 50 milliliters

19
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.740
every six hours would be prohibited.

20
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.460
So when we announced that we were adopting the water prohibited lists and

21
00:01:09.461 --> 00:01:12.460
prohibited methods,
um,
there was some,

22
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.490
some blowback within the UFC community saying,
hey,

23
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.390
these things are used regularly because fighters are pushing themselves to the

24
00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:22.540
edge to make weight and do you understand what you're doing here?

25
00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:25.240
You're going to put fighters and unsafe positions where they're going to get in

26
00:01:25.241 --> 00:01:30.010
and not be,
um,
rehydrated.
So we took a look at that and,

27
00:01:30.011 --> 00:01:34.090
um,
spoke with you,
saw it,
and he said,
hey,
you know,
maybe we should,
you know,

28
00:01:34.091 --> 00:01:38.080
slowly rolled out the ivy bands.
So we actually delayed that by three months.

29
00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:42.760
The program went into effect July 1st and we instituted the IB band,

30
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.800
um,
October 1st.
So we had three months of getting fighters prepared for it,

31
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.480
educating them why,
um,
that they were banned.
Nevertheless,
I mean,

32
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.920
real quickly the whole weight cutting issue came kind of into my plate.

33
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.410
And while,
you know,
I wasn't an expert in it,

34
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.110
I had to get out and talk to a lot of fighters,
camps,

35
00:02:02.111 --> 00:02:05.010
coaches about ivs and give them,
you know,

36
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.820
alternatives to rehydrating the right way.
And so I,
again,

37
00:02:09.821 --> 00:02:10.990
not being an expert myself,

38
00:02:10.991 --> 00:02:14.190
I reached out to what I found were we're experts in the world.

39
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.850
A certain guy by name of Doctor Robert Kenefick who is a phd exercise

40
00:02:18.851 --> 00:02:19.780
physiologist,

41
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.970
works at the US Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine Studies,

42
00:02:24.971 --> 00:02:29.200
environmental effects on soldiers,
his expertise being dehydration.

43
00:02:29.201 --> 00:02:32.860
So soldiers in the Middle East that are marching for hours,

44
00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:37.000
days upon a time run out of water,
dehydrate themselves.

45
00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:38.680
How do we get these fighters back?

46
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.640
Are these soldiers back rehydrated and back into the fight and thought,
hey,

47
00:02:42.641 --> 00:02:46.480
this is the type of expert that we need to talk to.
Its extreme dehydration.
Not,

48
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.370
you know,
some kid that has diarrhea,
it's mildly dehydrated with some,

49
00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:53.940
some pedialyte.
So we brought him in.
Um,

50
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.910
had him actually the week of UFC 200,
um,
he was in town,

51
00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.500
got a chance to talk to lot of the,

52
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.250
the fighters coming in and analyze the message they were using.
Um,

53
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.160
he recommended to us,
hey,
you know,
here's the maximum amount of weight fighters,

54
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.370
you know,
that you should recommend.
Fighters are losing that fight week.

55
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:15.730
And that's how we came up with our weight guideline of 8%.

56
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:20.440
So we recommend when those fighters check in Tuesday for a Saturday fight,

57
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.650
they're within 8% of their goal weight,
usually on Friday.

58
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.070
I'm not a requirement or recommendation,
but you know,

59
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:31.930
we put that out there and educated heavily on that.
Um,
since then,
uh,

60
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.030
you talked,
I think last week about Andy Foster,

61
00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:37.240
the executive director of California who's really taken the lead in terms of

62
00:03:37.241 --> 00:03:41.200
commissions on combating dangerous weight cutting.
Um,

63
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.120
he worked with US pretty closely on developing his 10 point weight cutting plan

64
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:49.590
or plan to combat serious weight cutting.
Um,

65
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.400
includes his commission making calls to fighters on the car 30 days out,

66
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.080
10 days out,
making them a little bit more accountable,
uh,

67
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.830
farther out than fight week.
Um,
he's also got a provision where fight night,

68
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.090
he takes the fighters weight,

69
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.250
weighs them and their recommendation is you only put on 10% of your weight back

70
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:11.620
on plus a pound.
Um,

71
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.830
if they're over that California can recommend the fight or move up a weight

72
00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:18.670
class.
Um,
so really,
yeah,
I mean just a lot of,
you know,

73
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:21.640
education recommendations,
not here.
A lot of people talk about,

74
00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:25.120
and I'm curious for your thoughts on this,
hey,
we can,

75
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.960
we can stop this instantaneously.
See instantaneously just put rules out there.

76
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.170
If you lose this much weight or put this much weight back on,

77
00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:35.480
you're suspended for six months,
12 months,
you know,
whatever your,

78
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.830
we're just not going to let you,
you fight my concern.
There's,

79
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.900
when you have absolute rules,

80
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.090
fighter's going to do everything possible to,
you know,
to make weight.

81
00:04:46.091 --> 00:04:49.180
Say you had a rule that if you miss,
wait,
you can't fight it again for 12 months.

82
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:53.080
You have to move up a weight class fighter's going to kill themselves to make

83
00:04:53.081 --> 00:04:54.280
weight.
My fear would be that you,

84
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.390
you put an absolute rule out there and someone get hurts because of the rule

85
00:04:58.391 --> 00:05:02.140
that you put in place,
which is,
hey,
you know,
I think it's a measured approach.

86
00:05:02.141 --> 00:05:04.030
You have to continually reevaluate it.

87
00:05:04.031 --> 00:05:07.990
But I think right now the rules that are out there between our recommendations,

88
00:05:07.991 --> 00:05:11.590
California's rules are more guideline recommendations.

89
00:05:11.591 --> 00:05:15.910
And then that in conjunction with what we're doing at the performance institute

90
00:05:15.911 --> 00:05:16.830
where,
I mean,

91
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.840
you saw last week there was no excuse if you have issues making weight or you're

92
00:05:22.151 --> 00:05:23.590
not sure what your weight class is,

93
00:05:23.591 --> 00:05:28.570
that you have every resource available the best in the world to you to come in

94
00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:32.680
and find that out,
to be given a plan on how to safely and make weight.

95
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.910
Um,
so,
you know,
it's,
it's,

96
00:05:34.911 --> 00:05:39.190
it's a multimillion dollar investment that the UFC has put I think toward that

97
00:05:39.191 --> 00:05:43.070
problem and you know,
hey,
maybe two,
three years from now we say,
hey,

98
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.230
that was with good intentions,
but not enough.
We need to do more.

99
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.980
But I think right now,
um,
that's our strategy,
uh,
on the issue.
Well,

100
00:05:50.981 --> 00:05:54.820
I think a couple things would have to happen to really stop weight cutting.

101
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.380
One thing you're going to have to blow up these weight classes because there's

102
00:05:57.381 --> 00:06:00.320
going to be champions in these weight classes that really won't be in that

103
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:01.340
weight class anymore.

104
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.520
If you cut all the real heavy duty weight cutting out of the picture.

105
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.570
I think what one FC is trying to do is they're,

106
00:06:10.571 --> 00:06:13.250
they're doing hydration test and they do a series of them.

107
00:06:13.251 --> 00:06:16.970
I believe they do three leading up to the fight,
which really was it.

108
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.440
Benevidez was telling me this,
someone,
someone was telling me this,
um,

109
00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.560
that they've essentially made it almost impossible for you to cut weight.

110
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.600
So they do an hydration test on weighing at the way they're doing hydration test

111
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.600
three different times,
three different times leading up to the fight.

112
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.070
I don't know the exact protocol,

113
00:06:34.071 --> 00:06:37.130
but what they've done is essentially made it so that you can't be dehydrated.

114
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.980
Like you can't,
when you weigh in,
you have to weigh in and as you know,

115
00:06:39.981 --> 00:06:43.390
like if you're fighting at one 70 but you know,
you,

116
00:06:43.391 --> 00:06:46.310
you get on the scale and you're fucking dying.
Like they're like,
no,

117
00:06:46.311 --> 00:06:50.360
you're not really one 70 like,
and that,
that's really where it should be.

118
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.540
This idea that the best way to fight is to cheat and to drain all yourself of

119
00:06:55.731 --> 00:07:00.050
fluids and then pretend that you're 160 pounds,
then get back on the scale,

120
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.280
you know,
15 hours later at one 85.

121
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.800
That's fucking crazy.
That doesn't make any sense.

122
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.500
You're not really 160 pound fighter.
You're 185 pound fighter who almost died.

123
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.310
Yeah,
it's interesting,
you know,

124
00:07:14.311 --> 00:07:17.460
if talk with forests a lot about this because he went through it and again why

125
00:07:17.461 --> 00:07:22.370
he's such a great asset to,
to the probe,
to the company.
Uh,
but he says,

126
00:07:22.371 --> 00:07:27.140
look,
there's certain guys and girls that have,
uh,
genetic,
um,

127
00:07:27.141 --> 00:07:30.830
ability to,
to carry,
you know,
the have good muscle mass.

128
00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:34.760
Usually that just carry a ton of water and it's not,
it's not difficult.

129
00:07:34.761 --> 00:07:37.800
It's not dangerous for them to drop 10 or 15 pounds.

130
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:42.040
But it would be if they fought 15 pounds under c.
If,

131
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.720
if they're a fighting at 170 pounds,

132
00:07:44.721 --> 00:07:48.770
they really weigh one 85 and if they cut down to one 70 they make that weight

133
00:07:48.771 --> 00:07:51.380
and then thought right then,
then it would be dangerous.

134
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.060
Their performance would be radically diminished.

135
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.280
So we're lying when those people get on the scale,

136
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.570
when they get on the scale and they flex and they say one 70 sure you're one 70

137
00:07:59.571 --> 00:08:01.360
for about an hour,
you know,

138
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:04.520
and then you're going to go right back up to what you were before you dehydrated

139
00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:06.530
yourself.
This is madness to me.

140
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.070
Goes against what fighting is supposed to be.

141
00:08:10.071 --> 00:08:14.180
What we talked about before about discipline and focus and and and technique and

142
00:08:14.181 --> 00:08:17.270
training.
That's what competing is supposed to be about.

143
00:08:17.271 --> 00:08:22.271
It's supposed to be about a fight or two equally skillful individuals try to

144
00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:25.220
figure out who's got the best strategy and who's got the best we'll and

145
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:26.203
technique.

146
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:31.370
It's not supposed to be about who can do this legal cheating thing best cause.

147
00:08:31.371 --> 00:08:35.570
That's what weight cutting is.
You know,
really the modern history of the UFC.

148
00:08:35.571 --> 00:08:39.170
And the reason I think it's so successful is the Renzo and Dana ran toward

149
00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:42.750
regulation,
right?
Yes.
They said,
hey,
this is a no,
you know,

150
00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:47.030
marketed as an no rules,
no hold bar event.
They ran toward rules.

151
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:50.360
And so I think you know what you're talking and I actually had a discussion with

152
00:08:50.361 --> 00:08:52.790
Bob then at about this executive director of Nevada.

153
00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.730
He's Graham last week and you know,
he's looking what California is doing.

154
00:08:56.731 --> 00:09:00.990
He says,
look,
we have physicals after the way in.

155
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:03.480
So you know,
we do the way it is now at the host hotel.

156
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:07.020
So it's usually done at a ballroom fighter,
gets up on the scale,

157
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.250
makes weight immediately,

158
00:09:08.251 --> 00:09:11.100
goes behind the curtain and has their pre-fight physical.
Right.

159
00:09:11.101 --> 00:09:14.130
But do they have a hydration test?
They don't.

160
00:09:14.131 --> 00:09:16.800
I know California does some hydration testing fight night.

161
00:09:16.801 --> 00:09:19.030
But would Bob told me is I have the most experience,

162
00:09:19.031 --> 00:09:22.370
ringside physicians in the world that have seen more,
you know,

163
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.030
combat sports events and everywhere.

164
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:28.680
I'm comfortable that these guys are evaluating these medical professionals or

165
00:09:28.681 --> 00:09:31.320
evaluating these fighters in this scenario.

166
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.130
And if they feel or see is not safe for that fight or to compete the next night

167
00:09:35.131 --> 00:09:37.050
that they'll call them off.
I think that's wonderful.

168
00:09:37.051 --> 00:09:41.010
But I think all that does is keep fighters from getting to the point of death.

169
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.340
I mean,
getting to the point where they're sick and Tara,

170
00:09:43.341 --> 00:09:45.690
they're definitely compromised when they're making the weight.

171
00:09:45.691 --> 00:09:49.170
They're not really at that weight.
What I would really love in a perfect world,

172
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.490
besides the bare knuckle thing,

173
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:55.080
what I would really love is a weight class every 10 pounds.
Just have every time.

174
00:09:55.081 --> 00:09:56.610
I mean there's just giant gaps.

175
00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:01.500
The gap between 85 and two oh five is 20 fucking pounds.
That's a lot of weight.

176
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:02.851
I hear that.

177
00:10:02.851 --> 00:10:07.851
But let me give you a scenario where it shows that alone and can work female new

178
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.240
division for the UFC one 25 right?

179
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.240
Because we had a one 15 to one 35 pound gap,
right?

180
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:17.460
What happened in our first championship fight,

181
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:22.340
so Jara Eubanks couldn't make weight.
She,

182
00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:25.500
she wasn't even there.
That in and of itself,

183
00:10:25.501 --> 00:10:27.960
just making a weight class I don't think solves the problem.

184
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.320
But she's also relatively inexperienced young to sport and this is a brand new

185
00:10:33.541 --> 00:10:35.390
way class that they really didn't have a,
like,

186
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.880
I'm not saying he had more weight classes wouldn't help,

187
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:39.390
but they're not going to help by themselves.

188
00:10:39.391 --> 00:10:41.970
You gotta it's gotta be a multiple ag wrong attack.

189
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.790
I think the hydration test should be along with that,

190
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:49.650
the hydration test and weight classes every 10 pounds and then give the champion

191
00:10:49.651 --> 00:10:52.640
the benefit of the doubt.
Like whoever is the champion,
each division,
whatever,

192
00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:54.120
whatever weight class,

193
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:59.730
you know what we find out what they really way and they have an opportunity to

194
00:10:59.731 --> 00:11:02.210
fight for the title in that weight class.
You have to,

195
00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.740
I think we talked about it when you her through the Pie,

196
00:11:04.741 --> 00:11:09.741
but we have on a couple of occasion use that bioelectrical impedance machine to

197
00:11:09.781 --> 00:11:14.350
determine is that the proper term?
I don't know.
Um,
but it basically can,
you know,

198
00:11:14.351 --> 00:11:15.680
you step on the scale and you,

199
00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.430
you hold on these handles and it gives you some type of hydration reading.
Um,

200
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:24.600
we've done that a few times on checking day,
weigh in day.

201
00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:27.780
We're not sure exactly what the numbers look like,
but that's something that,

202
00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:28.920
you know,
we're looking into.

203
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:33.960
Clint also does a lot of specific gravity testing fight week on fighters where

204
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.840
you know,
it'll be a Tuesday or Wednesday and I think he showed you that,

205
00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.490
that chart.
Um,

206
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.180
he'll look at how much weight fighter has to lose and then look at what their

207
00:11:42.181 --> 00:11:45.720
specific gravity reading is,
how diluted or concentrated the urine is.

208
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:49.980
And you know,
if you see someone with a bunch of weight to lose that is,
you know,

209
00:11:49.981 --> 00:11:53.350
relatively dehydrated specific gravity wise,
then you know,

210
00:11:53.351 --> 00:11:56.710
it can alter their plans.
So yeah,
I mean we've got a lot of,

211
00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.240
a lot of that stuff going on.

212
00:11:58.241 --> 00:12:02.560
I don't necessarily disagree with you that that more needs to be done the right

213
00:12:02.561 --> 00:12:07.090
now our plan of attack is to use these resources,
use the facility of the pie.

214
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.740
You know,
in an ideal world,
I think rather than making these absolute rules,

215
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.340
trying to educate our fighters,
trying to show them,
I tell you one thing,

216
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:19.630
you can talk until you're blue in the face about things being bad,

217
00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.640
unhealthy for a fighter.
They're like,
I'm bullet proof.
Not only that,

218
00:12:24.641 --> 00:12:28.750
they're fighters,
they're fighting.
That's bad for you anyway.
Right?
Like,
oh,

219
00:12:28.751 --> 00:12:31.600
cut and weights bad for me too.
Okay.
Where they start listening,

220
00:12:31.601 --> 00:12:34.240
and I think this is where the performance institute comes into play when you

221
00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:38.710
start talking about the effect on your performance.
Um,
so if you tell them,

222
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.310
hey look,
if you can come to,
you know,

223
00:12:42.311 --> 00:12:47.311
your proper weight and a more measured approach and not lose a whole bunch and

224
00:12:47.321 --> 00:12:48.370
put that one look,

225
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:53.400
look at the difference it's gonna make on your performance 24 to 30 hours later

226
00:12:53.591 --> 00:12:56.500
because you see this,
I mean,
you see this occasionally when fighters go through,

227
00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:00.760
you know,
tough weight cuts.
You see them softer around her too.
Right?
Oh good.

228
00:13:00.761 --> 00:13:03.760
He's looked moving up to 170 pounds.
I mean,
it's just phenomenal.

229
00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.200
I also think now it's interesting,
there's,
you know,

230
00:13:06.201 --> 00:13:07.870
on one side of it the criticism would be,

231
00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:11.410
well you're just encouraging even greater weight cuts and regains.

232
00:13:11.411 --> 00:13:14.320
But I think this morning weigh and thing that we've,

233
00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:18.550
we've put together I think has had a positive impact in a couple of areas.

234
00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:21.010
Explain that for people in the world we're talking about.
Yeah.

235
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:22.630
So actually Andy Foster again,

236
00:13:22.631 --> 00:13:26.650
California before UFC 199 came to me and said,
hey,

237
00:13:26.651 --> 00:13:30.880
we've been doing this morning weigh in for a couple of regional local shows.

238
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:35.470
Would you guys be interested in it?
Where we do it at the host hotel,
we do it,

239
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:35.681
you know,

240
00:13:35.681 --> 00:13:40.681
we'd open the scales from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM and the idea would be a fighter

241
00:13:40.931 --> 00:13:43.180
gets on weight in their hotel room,
upstairs,

242
00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.750
hops on the elevator steps on the scale.
They make weight,

243
00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:50.650
they can start eating and drinking again right away with the idea of they don't

244
00:13:50.651 --> 00:13:53.230
have to wait until 4:00 PM and that's exactly what the idea of,

245
00:13:53.231 --> 00:13:55.870
I think one of the dangers of,
you know,

246
00:13:55.871 --> 00:13:59.510
weight cutting and being dehydrated is the amount of time that you're at a,

247
00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.210
you know,
at a loss of that water.

248
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:05.210
And in the past when we'd have the weigh ins at an arena,
um,

249
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.270
it would be the fighter would have to check in.

250
00:14:07.271 --> 00:14:11.220
Downstairs we had the way ends at four o'clock in an arena,
the firewood,

251
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.950
the fighter with check in downstairs that maybe two,
um,

252
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:16.870
two 30 the bus would leave.

253
00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:20.680
I remember when Rio were in one time on a bus for an hour,

254
00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.221
hour and a half to the arena.

255
00:14:21.221 --> 00:14:23.860
Everybody's depleted and dehydrated on the bus ride,

256
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:26.740
you step on a scale and a cold,
you know,

257
00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.410
environmentally unfriendly arena.

258
00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.740
You then get back on the bus drive another hour,
hour and a half.

259
00:14:32.741 --> 00:14:36.520
You're talking multiple hours where these fighters are in a depleted state.

260
00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:39.310
So I think the morning way and protects against that.

261
00:14:39.311 --> 00:14:41.500
I think the other benefit we've seen out of it,

262
00:14:41.501 --> 00:14:44.020
and I think it's more of a longterm than a short term benefit,

263
00:14:44.021 --> 00:14:47.650
is we've seen a lot more fighters missing weight since we went to the morning

264
00:14:47.651 --> 00:14:52.651
weigh ins and I think that's a product of timing and that in the past you had

265
00:14:53.031 --> 00:14:54.800
four,
you know,
four or five in the afternoon,

266
00:14:54.801 --> 00:14:59.070
you had all day long to cut weight and you would see fighters at 10 or 11 said,

267
00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.970
I can't do anymore and a one or two o'clock.
I said,
no,

268
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.640
I can do a couple more pounds and just all day long now,

269
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.190
unless you're literally not sleeping the night before you fight,

270
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:10.190
you have a shorter window in the morning to do that.

271
00:15:10.191 --> 00:15:11.450
And I think a lot of those myths,

272
00:15:11.451 --> 00:15:14.840
weights has help identify those fighters that I'm probably in the right,

273
00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:18.500
the wrong weight class.
I can't make that weight of waking up,
you know,

274
00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:19.490
five or six in the morning,

275
00:15:19.491 --> 00:15:21.800
a couple hours and it's probably too much weight to lose.

276
00:15:21.801 --> 00:15:24.800
And we've seen some fighters move up in weight class because of that.

277
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.830
We've also seen some fighters that have decided,
hey,

278
00:15:27.831 --> 00:15:31.790
I gotta take this more professionally and hire a nutritionist.
Like could be,

279
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:35.780
could be a number of Madoff who made weight easily for his last fight and the

280
00:15:35.781 --> 00:15:40.010
fight before that obviously fell out of the fight because his body shut down.

281
00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:43.400
He had to go to the hospital.
It'd be rehydrated.
Yeah,
I mean I,
again,

282
00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:46.460
I don't think it's a one size fits all solution.
You have to be careful.

283
00:15:46.461 --> 00:15:49.340
Hey Habib,
missed weight that last time.
Went to the hospital.

284
00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.500
You don't have a knee jerk reaction would be you.

285
00:15:51.501 --> 00:15:54.350
You can't fight this weight anymore.
What we saw this time,

286
00:15:54.351 --> 00:15:56.570
he just changed the way he did things.
He came in,

287
00:15:56.571 --> 00:16:00.500
he was on wait the night before.
He had a couple of pounds to lose fight week.

288
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:04.340
Yeah.
So it can be done and again,
that reverts back to the performance institute.

289
00:16:04.341 --> 00:16:09.050
I think there's no excuse now that if you're a new fighter and you're not making

290
00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:12.360
a hell of a lot of money and don't have the resources to hire,
you know,

291
00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:15.200
George Lockhart,
whoever you now have,
Clint Wattenberg,

292
00:16:15.201 --> 00:16:20.201
who's an ivy league educated Sports Dietitian that can provide you all that

293
00:16:20.361 --> 00:16:24.200
remotely.
If you can't get to Vegas,
he'll give you a full plan over,
you know,

294
00:16:24.201 --> 00:16:28.100
over the phone,
over email.
Um,
if you can get to Vegas,

295
00:16:28.101 --> 00:16:30.920
not only will Clint plan things out for you,

296
00:16:30.921 --> 00:16:35.660
but you have a kitchen and cooks and staff that will provide you that meal

297
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:38.200
throughout your whole fight camp.
I just want to be there for free.

298
00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:47.780
<v 2>Yeah.</v>
