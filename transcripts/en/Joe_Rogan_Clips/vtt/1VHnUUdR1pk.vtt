1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
It makes you think that like,
it seems crazy now,
but it really won't be crazy.

2
00:00:04.651 --> 00:00:09.651
I think a generation from now for another country to threaten at least sanctions

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.000
and maybe military action to deal with that.
You know,
after World War II,

4
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.340
we built a whole liberal international order around the principle of human

5
00:00:17.341 --> 00:00:18.174
rights.

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.720
That would have been unthinkable in the 20th and yet it led to a series of

7
00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:24.750
military invent interventions over the next century,

8
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.080
half century because people were behaving badly toward their own citizens.

9
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.220
If we could do that,

10
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.390
it doesn't seem all that crazy to me that say 30 years from now,
uh,

11
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.190
unempowered imperial China looking at someone like Boston,
Ireland,

12
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.450
Brazil would just be like,
no,
you can't do that.
I'm just going to,

13
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.120
we're just going to go in and like take you out.

14
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.930
And this is what I mean when I say it's a kind of all encompassing,

15
00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:47.820
all impacting threat.

16
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.320
Our politics will be shaped by it are geopolitics will be shaped by it.
Our,

17
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.270
you know,
our,
everything will be shaped by it.

18
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.650
We could have climate wars like in the not too distant future.
Jesus Christ.

19
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.140
How is this being received?
The book?
Yeah.
Are People,
people resisting him?

20
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.380
Is there any anybody that wants to debate you on this?
So I,
you know,

21
00:01:07.381 --> 00:01:09.930
I wrote this article a couple of years ago that produced,

22
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.910
I mean it was a huge sort of viral phenomenon,

23
00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:15.810
but it produced also some scientific criticism and um,
you know,

24
00:01:15.811 --> 00:01:18.660
we published a fully annotated version where every single night we showed where

25
00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:19.830
every single line came from,

26
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.540
but there were still scientists who were arguing about whether the messaging was

27
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.130
precisely calibrated,
whether it was too bleak to dark.
Um,

28
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.570
the book has had none of that.
I mean it's first of all,

29
00:01:33.571 --> 00:01:37.590
it's been to best at first week it was on the times bestseller list number six,

30
00:01:37.591 --> 00:01:41.640
it's bestseller in England.
It's been in that of the Amazon top 10.
Um,

31
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.180
and all of the reviews have been really kind.
Um,

32
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.310
I think this goes to what you were saying before.

33
00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:48.750
I think like the conversation is changing.

34
00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:51.180
People are actually really interested in

35
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.120
talking seriously about just how big a deal this is in a way that they might not

36
00:01:57.121 --> 00:02:00.210
have been just a year ago.
Where is the resistance though?

37
00:02:00.211 --> 00:02:03.450
Is there any resistance to it right now to the bus?
Well,
not just the book,

38
00:02:03.451 --> 00:02:08.190
but just the concept in general.
73% of Americans believe climate change is real.

39
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.830
70% of Americans are concerned about it.

40
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.840
Those numbers are up 15% since 2015.
Who are the 27 that don't,
I mean,

41
00:02:15.841 --> 00:02:19.560
I think it's,
you know,
it's a hard right wingers.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But you know,

42
00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:21.170
those numbers are,
we live in,

43
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.210
we live in a culture now where like most people's worldview passes through a

44
00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:29.100
prism of partisan politics.
So like,
you know,

45
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.910
there's amazing studies that show that in the night in the early nineties,

46
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.760
there was no partisan divide between,
uh,
on the,

47
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.720
on the question of whether Oj Simpson was guilty when you control for race,

48
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.860
Republicans and Democrats had the same idea about Oj Simpson's guilt.

49
00:02:43.861 --> 00:02:45.270
That is totally unthinkable today.

50
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.800
And there's now a huge partisan split on whether 12 years a slave deserves an

51
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:53.490
Oscar.
Partisanship has totally taken over our,

52
00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:58.491
our minds such that the fact that we have 73% of Americans believe global

53
00:02:58.651 --> 00:03:00.970
warming is real and happening.
To me,

54
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:04.530
that's a really fucking high number actually,
because one of the two parts,

55
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.930
I don't think that the Republican party is really anymore a denier party.

56
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:11.740
I think they're just a party of skeptics and self interest.

57
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:13.990
They want to like look out for business interests,

58
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:15.910
which actually the calculus there is changing.

59
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:18.010
Wish I could talk about in a second.
Um,

60
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.720
but people don't want to believe that horrifying things are real because who

61
00:03:22.721 --> 00:03:27.040
would,
it's terrifying.
Um,
but 73% of the country,

62
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.140
that's a lot.
I mean that's,
you know,

63
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.800
that's more support than there is for just about anything.
Um,

64
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.240
so I'm like basically,
and the speed at which that,

65
00:03:36.241 --> 00:03:37.660
those numbers have grown is really dramatic.

66
00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:42.661
I said 15 points since 2015 eight points just since March has moved up.

67
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.810
That's incredible.
Um,

68
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.520
and I do think that the economic logic is really powerful here.

69
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:51.100
So it used to be the case that there was economic,
conventional wisdom.

70
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.230
That action on climate was going to be really expensive because you were

71
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.710
required massive upfront investment and it would mean also foregoing economic

72
00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:04.180
growth.
But all of the new research the last couple of years reverses that logic.

73
00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:04.541
Totally.

74
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:09.541
So there was a big report 2018 that said that we could add $26 trillion to the

75
00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:13.480
global economy through rapid decarbonization by just 2030.

76
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.760
We could avoid all of these horrible $600 trillion impacts that we're talking

77
00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:21.370
about if we decarbonized rapidly.

78
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.700
And there are also obviously business opportunities there,

79
00:04:24.701 --> 00:04:29.470
their whole solar empires to build their whole new electric grid to build.
Um,

80
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.850
so the economic conventional wisdom is now that fast action on climate is better

81
00:04:33.851 --> 00:04:34.684
for the economy,

82
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.870
then slow action on climate that hasn't yet totally taken over the perspective

83
00:04:40.121 --> 00:04:44.860
of our policymakers globally.
But I think it will soon.
And when it does,

84
00:04:44.861 --> 00:04:49.480
I think that we'll see like a real sea change in,
in their,
um,
perspective.

85
00:04:49.481 --> 00:04:52.900
Because I think for a long time,
even people who cared about climate thought,

86
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.520
well I want to do something,
but if I have to like cost some people,

87
00:04:57.521 --> 00:05:00.220
some jobs and costs like a percentage point of economic growth,

88
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.490
that's not worth it.
Let me just kick the can down the road.

89
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.760
This is a slow moving phenomenon.
We'll invent our way out of it.

90
00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:10.510
We'll grow our way out of it.
But all of the new research says like,

91
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.570
let's get started right now and

92
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.390
we'll see how that plays out.
I mean,

93
00:05:16.391 --> 00:05:20.530
if we really have to have global emissions by 2030,
it means really,

94
00:05:20.531 --> 00:05:23.440
really aggressive action,
which I don't think is possible.

95
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.340
But I do think that we'll see much more aggressive action in the decade ahead

96
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.000
than we've had in the decades in the past.

97
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.150
<v 1>So you think that once there's a financial incentive for people to,
uh,</v>

98
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.030
either,
uh,

99
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.140
some sort of an industry that reduces carbon or something along those lines,

100
00:05:38.141 --> 00:05:41.650
industries that are working to mitigate global warming,

101
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.140
that once there there's a financial sort of a benefit for these people to it to

102
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.030
innovate and to,
to move forward with this,
that that's what we're going to see.

103
00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:49.760
Real change.

104
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.810
<v 0>Yeah.
Well also that,
um,
I mean direct investment of particular companies,</v>

105
00:05:53.811 --> 00:05:55.790
but also,
you know,

106
00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.230
government leaders who around and say if the economic picture is going to be

107
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:01.580
better 10 years from now,

108
00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:05.030
if we make massive investments in green energy than it would be an,

109
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.600
and even like pass laws,
you know,

110
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.550
regulating safety,
fuel efficiency,
or even banning internal combustion engines,

111
00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:16.350
which I think will happen within a couple of decades.
Um,

112
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.640
if that's going to be at the economic picture,

113
00:06:19.641 --> 00:06:23.090
taking that path is much rosier than the economic picture of inaction.

114
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.370
I think they'll go down the path of action.
Um,
and you know,
again,

115
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:31.880
the question is how aggressively,
how quickly,
um,
and in what form.

116
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.490
But I do think that,
you know,

117
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.450
I do think the incentives will be different five years from now than they looked

118
00:06:38.451 --> 00:06:41.780
five years ago.
And that'll be,
that'll be huge.
So that,

119
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.560
that you think would be a great motivator for people to shift their perceptions

120
00:06:45.561 --> 00:06:50.561
and particularly right wing folks maybe amongst the 27% that are in denial?

121
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.520
Yeah.
Well,
I mean,
if you look around the world,

122
00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:54.170
denial is not really a problem anywhere,

123
00:06:54.171 --> 00:06:56.720
but the u s there's a little bit of an in the UK,

124
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.550
but it's a totally American phenomenon.

125
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.940
And when you understand that the u s is only 15% of all global emissions,

126
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.630
cause that's just typical American arrogance.
Like what,
what do,

127
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.300
what do you think is the root of that?
Uh,
I think it's,

128
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.330
it's basically bad behavior by the oil companies.
I mean,

129
00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:15.860
they've like put out really aggressive,
um,
disinformation in denial.

130
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.180
You ever see the movie a merchants of doubt?
Yeah,
yeah.
Perfect example of that,

131
00:07:20.181 --> 00:07:23.780
right?
Yeah,
totally.
Um,
yeah,
and I know that the people who wrote the book too,

132
00:07:23.781 --> 00:07:26.840
who are really,
really great,
um,
and you know,

133
00:07:26.841 --> 00:07:31.130
it's especially horrifying because in the sixties and seventies that the oil

134
00:07:31.131 --> 00:07:34.520
companies were like doing some of the most ambitious research on climate.

135
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.510
So they are,
you know,
then they ended up suppressing that going forward.

136
00:07:38.511 --> 00:07:43.511
But they knew shit about how the planet was going to change before any of the

137
00:07:44.541 --> 00:07:47.430
rest of us.
Really.
Um,
yeah,

138
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.780
there's no alternatives back then and there was no real emission standards.

139
00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:54.980
So it's like this a,
that's when catalytic converters started being enacted.
Well,

140
00:07:54.981 --> 00:07:59.690
you know,
somewhere around then if we had started decarbonization in 2000,

141
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:03.440
which just coincidentally was the year that Al Gore won the popular vote for

142
00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:04.910
president,
um,

143
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.900
we would have had to globally cut emissions by about 3% per year to get below

144
00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:12.980
two degrees.
We're now at a spot where we have to cut them by about 10% per year.

145
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.250
And if we wait another decade,
we're going to have to cut them by 30% per year,

146
00:08:16.251 --> 00:08:18.160
which is like an unthinkable of great.

147
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:22.730
So we wouldn't have had to take such aggressive action if we had started early,

148
00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:27.680
we would have had to just be doing moderate kind of on the margins,

149
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:28.790
um,
changes.

150
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.850
But we're now in a situation where the problem is way too big for that.

151
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.540
And there are people who want to talk about the solutions that could have been

152
00:08:35.541 --> 00:08:36.680
useful 20 years ago.

153
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.340
Now I'm talking about the carbon tax is like one quite popular thing to talk

154
00:08:40.341 --> 00:08:44.570
about.
Um,
the UN says that in order to be effective,
the carbon,

155
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:49.430
a global carbon tax would need to be perhaps as high as $5,500 a ton.

156
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:50.990
And there's nowhere else in the world.

157
00:08:50.991 --> 00:08:54.620
There's nowhere in the world where there's a tax that's even one 100th as high

158
00:08:54.621 --> 00:08:56.400
as that right now.
Um,

159
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.260
and the places in the world where they do have carbon taxes,

160
00:08:58.261 --> 00:09:00.770
everybody's admissions are still grew up going up.
So there,

161
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.720
there was a time when like the kind of like you don't have to change anything.

162
00:09:03.721 --> 00:09:07.110
We'll just like fiddle on the margins here could worked if we had taken,

163
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.920
if we had really been focused on it.
But we're sort of past that point now,

164
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.910
unfortunately.
Um,
but it's interesting,
you know,
the,

165
00:09:13.911 --> 00:09:17.360
the talking about the oil companies,
um,
I think they,
you know,

166
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.990
I think they're responsible for denial,

167
00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:22.880
but I also think that denial is not all that important in American politics.
Um,

168
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.590
because when you look around the world,
you see many countries,

169
00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:27.240
which v with very different politics,

170
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:32.540
even quite universally focused on climate issues who are not behaving any better

171
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.490
when it comes to carbon than we are.
And so you think,
well,

172
00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:36.690
what is the sickness here?

173
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.230
Is that the Republican Party and their climate denial or is it the fact that all

174
00:09:40.231 --> 00:09:43.320
of us just want,
you know,
more better,

175
00:09:43.321 --> 00:09:48.321
cheaper stuff and we have a really hard time conceiving of different paths that

176
00:09:48.841 --> 00:09:53.430
don't push us forward towards more consumption and you know,

177
00:09:53.431 --> 00:09:54.370
more,
um,

178
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:58.260
more than modern amenities that we sort of assume we'll keep accumulating over

179
00:09:58.261 --> 00:10:01.470
time.
I mean,
people say financial capitalism is the problem.

180
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.960
I have some sympathy for that view,
but I also look around the world.

181
00:10:03.961 --> 00:10:06.720
I see social democracies who are behaving really poorly when it comes to carbon.

182
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.750
I see socialist countries who are behaving really poorly when it comes to
carbon.

183
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:14.940
Um,
it seems on some level like it's even deeper than the systems that we have to

184
00:10:14.941 --> 00:10:18.630
organize and manage.
Um,
our cultural priorities.

185
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:23.400
And there are now,
you know,
getting back to the village,
any of the oil companies,

186
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:26.700
they're now all these lawsuits that are being brought against them for basically

187
00:10:26.701 --> 00:10:30.780
on the model of the,
of the cigarette company is like that for climate damages.

188
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.400
And um,
that may be,
they may be victorious.

189
00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:37.420
They may put some of these companies out of business.
Um,

190
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:39.690
I think it's not that likely,
but it's possible.

191
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.390
There are also other lawsuits that are happening in a really interesting,

192
00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:47.080
there's one in the Netherlands that some people held,
um,

193
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:49.710
the Dutch government.
They basically,

194
00:10:49.711 --> 00:10:53.370
the Dutch government was not honoring the Paris accords and citizens sued to

195
00:10:53.371 --> 00:10:55.590
hold them to that and we won the case.

196
00:10:55.591 --> 00:10:58.920
So the Dutch government is now obligated legally to do better on climate than

197
00:10:58.921 --> 00:10:59.820
they were doing on their own.

198
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:04.560
And in the u s there's this amazing court case called Juliana versus the United

199
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:04.561
States,

200
00:11:04.561 --> 00:11:09.561
which is a lawsuit being brought by kids using this kind of ingenious use of the

201
00:11:10.941 --> 00:11:12.150
equal protection clause.

202
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:17.270
They're arguing that their generation has been exposed to climate damages,

203
00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.870
that there the previous generation,
their parents generation were protected from.

204
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:26.760
And so they're saying this climate policy is a violation of the equal protection

205
00:11:26.761 --> 00:11:30.000
clause.
You're not protecting us in the same way that you protected our parents.

206
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:31.980
That's at the District Court in Oregon,

207
00:11:31.981 --> 00:11:33.870
which is just one level below the supreme court.

208
00:11:33.871 --> 00:11:36.900
I think it will win in the District Court almost certainly won't win in the

209
00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.580
Supreme Court,
but if it did one of the Supreme Court,

210
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:44.180
it would immediately obligate the u s to a totally maximalist climate policy

211
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:49.710
because it's literally impossible to protect the next generation from climate

212
00:11:49.711 --> 00:11:52.080
damages as fully as the previous generation was.

213
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:54.580
But they'd be to do everything they could,

214
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:57.320
which would mean sort of suddenly something like the um,

215
00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.850
the World War Two scale mobilization that the UN calls for,

216
00:12:00.851 --> 00:12:02.890
which would be really kind of dramatic and incredible.

217
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:08.400
And I think that's one path forward is through litigation because so many places

218
00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:11.670
in the world,
it's not just politics are a nerd,

219
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.180
like American politics are a nerd.

220
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:17.200
It's just there's a lot of slow moving bureaucracy and,
um,

221
00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.000
slow moving public opinion.

222
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:22.510
And in the same way that a lot of civil rights victories were fought and won in

223
00:12:22.511 --> 00:12:25.260
the courts,
I think we might be able to make some progress in,

224
00:12:25.261 --> 00:12:27.310
in the courts on climate too.
We'll see.
