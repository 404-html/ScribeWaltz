WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.970
I'm getting better.
Uh,
hopefully I'll fight.
Uh,
first quarter.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.480
When did you get your shoulder surgery?
So I got it in like late March.

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.470
What was it?
Um,
labor them.
Uh,
but it was actually,
yeah,

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.810
labor rotator cuff I think,
but my rotator cuff was just fine.
Um,

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.240
and it's,
it's kept me out for a while,
but the whole time I've been,
um,

6
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.870
and it was actually after being on the podcast last time I'm talking about

7
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:23.920
bullying.
It's like,
how can we make a difference in,

8
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.960
there was such a response from Jerry Jerry,
like community saying,

9
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.150
let's do something here that also,

10
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.730
let's make a difference here in the United States of bullying.

11
00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:35.460
How can you use it?
How can you prevent billing pulling?
What do you think?

12
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.430
I've always said that one of the best ways is teach people to actually fight.

13
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.540
Yeah.
I think that,
well,

14
00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:42.810
a lot of bullies are hugely insecure and if they just learned how to fight,

15
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:45.060
they wouldn't act like that.
Right.
I think,

16
00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:48.900
I think martial arts is going to be a tool.
So what we want to do this year is,

17
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.470
is to get into a hundred martial arts academies.
Um,

18
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.180
with a bullying prevention curriculum.

19
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.640
A lot of people don't know that 160,000 kids in the United States alone,

20
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.800
160,000 kids every day,
skip school,
skip school because of bullying.

21
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.750
That's 3 million school days last a year,
or sorry,
a month,
3 million school days,

22
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.613
lost a month.

23
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.830
And then I started digging into it because Oklahoma's become home now and like

24
00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:19.770
28.9% of the students deal with depression that's debilitating.

25
00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:24.390
That affects them for two weeks or more school to,
I mean,
depression,
addiction,

26
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.810
suicides in school,
shootings are all through the roof.
And you know,

27
00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:32.620
it's the suicide rate that you said.
So,
so insane in Oklahoma fit.

28
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.240
This is the at risk youth,
um,

29
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.240
behavior survey and they say that 15.4 no,

30
00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:43.260
15.1% of the students are dealing with suicidal ideation,

31
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.830
like seriously considering suicide.
And then 7.4,

32
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.120
7.4% of the students had attempted suicide,
attempted it.

33
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.140
I was one of those kids.

34
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.250
I was one of those kids in it's seven out of a hundred kids have attempted

35
00:01:56.251 --> 00:01:58.020
suicide,
just an Oklahoma schools.
And that,
that,

36
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.410
that goes around the country to around that 6%,
8%.

37
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.680
I was on a bullying prevention summit in San Antonio with congressman or a US

38
00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:08.850
representative will Hurd.

39
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.910
He brought me in and to speak with Maureen Molek and Maureen.
Um,

40
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.990
she has a foundation called David's legacy.

41
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.550
She started it because her son in San Antonio was getting ridiculed in cyber

42
00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:22.980
bullied relentlessly.
You know,
whenever we were growing up,

43
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.350
bullying would end at 3:00 PM.
Right,
because you're out of school.

44
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.910
But now it just increases because kids aren't in school,
they aren't in class.

45
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.810
And so,
so that's whenever they can really take off and start bullying.
Well,

46
00:02:33.811 --> 00:02:37.580
David had over 300 comments of people,
uh,

47
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.140
that were just brutally cyberbullying them.

48
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.980
A ton of them are calling for a suicide.
Um,
it went on for weeks and weeks.

49
00:02:43.981 --> 00:02:47.730
They moved them from schools.
He attempted suicide and at once or twice,

50
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.580
but his third time,
his third time,
you're successful.

51
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.030
And I'm very proud of Maureen.
Uh,

52
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.290
very proud of her because she got a law passed called David's law.

53
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.990
David's laws about cyberbullying.
Uh,

54
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.990
we want to see if we can get that into Oklahoma.
What is the law?

55
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.490
So the law basically Maureen's family was told basically at school,

56
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.300
the school was good to them.
They were trying to make a difference,

57
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.330
but they're basically saying their hands were tied,
their hands are tied from,

58
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.050
from doing anything about it because it was an overwhelming response of
students.

59
00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:24.340
I mean 300 students,
and then it was off school property and it was online.

60
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.640
So there they said their hands were tied.
Well,
now,
um,

61
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.990
the law basically brings into effect that law enforcement and the schools can

62
00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:35.980
get involved off the school campus and they can look into the cyber bullying and

63
00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:40.090
they can take action against it.
So it basically just means,
hey,
this is serious.

64
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.770
Um,
and,
and,
and it's not okay.
Um,

65
00:03:43.771 --> 00:03:46.530
and we're going to stand up and do something about it.
Texas,
I'm proud of Texas.

66
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.070
My home state,
um,
they passed it 33 to zero.
No one voted against it.

67
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.900
Um,
and it's really great.
We're,

68
00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:57.550
we're working with a state representative named Collin Walkie.
I'm in Oklahoma,

69
00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.770
um,
and,
uh,
a judge,
Trevor Pemberton.
And then there's this principal named,

70
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.210
it's Kinda sounded like a joke last week.
It was a MMA fighter with a politician.

71
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.380
We went to dinner with a politician,
a judge in a high school principal,
you know,

72
00:04:11.381 --> 00:04:13.420
MMA fighter.
What brought us all together,
you know,
it was,

73
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:17.920
it was bullying prevention.
Um,
but,
uh,
debris on Davis.

74
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.170
She's the high school principal of Edmond North.

75
00:04:20.171 --> 00:04:24.010
It's one of the biggest and one of the best public schools in Oklahoma.
Um,

76
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.390
and in the last nine years of her working in public schools,

77
00:04:28.391 --> 00:04:32.770
she's been in nine funerals of kids that have all committed suicide.
And,
um,

78
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.903
it's,
uh,

79
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.470
it's just on the rise in such a brutal way.

80
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.830
And one of the things that really touched my heart and wanted me to get into to

81
00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:44.770
this like,
Hey,
we've fight for the forgotten.

82
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.920
We're always going to be focused on the pygmies.
Uh,

83
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.780
we're working with even expanding into the,
in Uganda,

84
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.730
we're working with the pygmy king of the Botswana pygmies and Uganda.
Um,

85
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.640
we're looking to do land,
water and food initiatives among them,

86
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.590
but there's kids in our own community right here that feel forgotten.
Um,

87
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.420
and whenever I was a kid sitting at the lunch table by myself,

88
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.090
getting pelted in the back of the head with chuck and spit wads food fist,
um,

89
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.970
when kids were pulling up my shirt and slap my belly and twist and my nipples in

90
00:05:12.971 --> 00:05:16.780
front of the girls and acting like they're hitting me with a harpoon,
you know,

91
00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:20.950
cause I'm the size of a whale and all this stuff,
you know,
it and,
and telling me,

92
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.620
you should just kill yourself,
telling me you should just kill yourself.

93
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.850
You're worthless.
You're nothing.
I mean,
I,
I felt forgotten,
um,
and thought,

94
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.391
you know,

95
00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:32.830
I am worthless and I should just kill myself and dealt with that over and over

96
00:05:32.831 --> 00:05:33.580
and over.

97
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.260
And now the kids are taken action on that in such an incredible way that we've

98
00:05:38.261 --> 00:05:41.050
got to stand up and do something.

99
00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.940
And so we're,
we're partnering.
And,
uh,
I'm really excited.

100
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:46.803
Um,

101
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.130
we are hopefully getting them to a hundred martial arts academies this year to

102
00:05:51.131 --> 00:05:54.020
equip them with bullying prevention curriculum.
Uh,

103
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.920
it's called heroes and waiting and you know,
uh,
uh,
a real inspiration to me.

104
00:05:57.921 --> 00:05:59.470
There's two things.
Um,

105
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.250
there's a ted talk called the psychology of evil.
Oh,
I'll text you that link.

106
00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:05.180
It's,
it's incredible,

107
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.040
but it's the psychology of evil and it's by getting with Philip Zimbardo or

108
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:11.280
something,
um,

109
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.720
and in there he kind of coins a term called heroes and waiting Philipson Bardot.

110
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.890
Yeah.
And,
uh,
then you,
uh,

111
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.480
you with the on it video that you did be the hero of your own movie,
you know,

112
00:06:23.481 --> 00:06:28.120
be the hero of your own movie.
Um,
I love that.
I love that,
that,
that,

113
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.100
that you've spoken out and said that about people.

114
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.040
You can be the hero of your own movie.
Well,
rose,

115
00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:36.980
in waiting the curriculum that we developed with century and Maya,

116
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:42.050
which is the martial arts industry association,
um,
it's all about teaching kids.

117
00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.750
It's,
it's bullying prevention,
but it's also character development.

118
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.310
So that is what prevents bullying.
Yeah,
absolutely.

119
00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:52.070
The only people that bully or people with weak characters.
Yeah.

120
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.950
And kids that are usually

121
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.740
<v 1>there's something wrong at home.
Right.</v>

122
00:06:56.741 --> 00:07:01.060
You know a lot of these kids that are bullies usually getting abused at home or

123
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.920
either by an older brother or by their dad or cousins or whoever the fuck it is,

124
00:07:05.921 --> 00:07:06.071
it's,

125
00:07:06.071 --> 00:07:09.130
and then they're taking it out on someone who they feel is weaker than them.

126
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:09.850
Right.

127
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.420
This is one of the reasons why I think martial arts is so important for young

128
00:07:13.421 --> 00:07:18.421
men because I mean we know from our experience in gyms when you're dealing with

129
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.240
like high level martial artists on a regular basis,

130
00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:23.740
like there is some of the nicest,

131
00:07:23.741 --> 00:07:26.410
friendliest fucking people you're ever going to meet because they don't have any

132
00:07:26.411 --> 00:07:28.720
insecurities.
I mean,
and whatever insecurities they have,

133
00:07:28.721 --> 00:07:31.270
they get out in the gym to get out through training.

134
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.770
They get all of their frustrations.

135
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.000
They don't have all this pent up fucked up energy that a lot of kids have.

136
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.280
Like kids.
Kids are always dealing with existential angst and the,

137
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:47.130
their whole life is just this weird ball of confusion and hormones.

138
00:07:48.041 --> 00:07:49.600
And you know,
the,
the,

139
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:53.380
the whole idea of life itself is so confusing.

140
00:07:53.381 --> 00:07:57.190
Then anytime they have any sort of control over anything they exercise it.

141
00:07:57.191 --> 00:08:00.220
Whether it's control over another kid or control over,
you know,

142
00:08:00.221 --> 00:08:03.700
throwing a rock through a window or they don't know what the fuck they're doing.

143
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:04.211
You know,

144
00:08:04.211 --> 00:08:09.211
they have all this pent up fucked up energy and pain and I,

145
00:08:09.591 --> 00:08:14.591
I think that so many of them are just severely lacking in guidance and

146
00:08:15.581 --> 00:08:17.950
discipline and just those things alone.

147
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:22.030
D Guidance and discipline and also the lessons that you learned from martial

148
00:08:22.031 --> 00:08:25.780
arts that you can overcome things that you can get better at things and that

149
00:08:25.781 --> 00:08:27.490
when you feel like quitting and you don't,

150
00:08:27.491 --> 00:08:31.850
you actually grow and learn like your experiences like training with Shawn and

151
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:35.290
Solow just like that.
It's,
it's one of the things in made you said a champion,

152
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.440
I mean training with people that are like,

153
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:42.820
it all started with my dad and having that when I was a kid ass.
You know,

154
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:44.770
you're so fortunate because of that.
I mean,

155
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.910
and those experiences are what shaped you into the person that you are today.

156
00:08:48.911 --> 00:08:52.600
And a lot of people don't get those experiences and unfortunately they act and

157
00:08:52.601 --> 00:08:56.040
disgraceful ways.
And this is what we're talking earlier.
I mean to

158
00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:01.000
<v 0>bring it all back to like what is martial arts and art is martial arts shit</v>

159
00:09:01.001 --> 00:09:06.001
talking and thrown dollies or is his martial arts really competing in one of the

160
00:09:07.441 --> 00:09:12.441
most difficult endeavors in all of all of the world of sports?

161
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:13.801
Well,

162
00:09:13.801 --> 00:09:16.830
so I came from a wrestling background and I believe that is without a doubt a

163
00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:20.910
martial art.
Yes,
it is for sure.
Set of martial art percent and then,
um,

164
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.570
in my coaches and one of the most important martial.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

165
00:09:24.571 --> 00:09:29.460
And one of the toughest to do one of the toughest without a doubt.
And then,
um,

166
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:34.040
but then coming into rough gym,
I mean,
Academy in school,
it,

167
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.660
it started teaching me like the martial arts principles.

168
00:09:36.661 --> 00:09:40.620
We didn't really talk about that so much.
Um,
in,
uh,

169
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.600
in wrestling it teaches you that,

170
00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:46.740
that naturally the hard work because it thins the flock pretty quick.

171
00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:51.140
If you can't,
you can't cut it.
But then what are the six blades like?
So,

172
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:55.480
so Solow,
he,
uh,
his logo,
uh,
it's the star and uh,

173
00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:58.320
he considers the mineral middle,
the spirit of the Samurai,

174
00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:01.680
and then there's six blades to the star.
Um,

175
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:06.450
and they stand for six different values.
Uh,
loyalty,
respect,

176
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.800
honor,
discipline,
attitude and family.

177
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.260
And those are the core principles inside,

178
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.630
inside the Children's program at my academy.
Uh,
and sort of just the,

179
00:10:17.631 --> 00:10:21.330
there it is right there.
The,
uh,
it's a very famous logo.
Yes,
it is.

180
00:10:21.331 --> 00:10:26.250
And I have right here.
I carry it with me everywhere I am.
Yeah.
That's it.

181
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:31.520
But,
um,
you know,
besides for the,
you know,
the,

182
00:10:31.521 --> 00:10:34.380
those are the,
the core values and then,
you know,

183
00:10:34.381 --> 00:10:38.970
being a forever student and a dedicated your life to learning and bettering

184
00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:43.770
yourself.
I mean,
these things that martial arts gives you,
I just,
I,
you know,

185
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.730
there are certain areas and other sports that they give you a piece of that,

186
00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:51.170
but nothing is like martial arts,
you know,
for me,
everything I know,

187
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.900
I've learned through martial arts.
There's,
yeah.

188
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:55.110
I think what you're saying that there's,

189
00:10:55.111 --> 00:10:58.640
there's other sports that teach you discipline.
Like Jasmine,

190
00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.270
if you become a long distance runner,
there's,

191
00:11:00.271 --> 00:11:02.880
there's discipline involved in that.
It's going to build up your character,

192
00:11:02.881 --> 00:11:07.490
but it's not specifically emphasized the way it is in martial arts.
And so I,

193
00:11:07.491 --> 00:11:10.760
I've been looking into and researching and we're partnering with century.

194
00:11:10.761 --> 00:11:13.350
We're partnering with Zebra,
we're partnering with Gameness,

195
00:11:13.351 --> 00:11:15.540
we're partnering with,
um,
Souplesse.
Uh,

196
00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:19.370
I don't know if you've seen the Bulgarian bags and the throwing dummies and the

197
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.380
gladiator wall.
We're partnering with them because Gladiator Wall,

198
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.230
glad your well is the wood that is,

199
00:11:25.231 --> 00:11:28.230
you can hang on it and you can do all sorts of stretching and different bars.

200
00:11:28.231 --> 00:11:30.930
The level almost looks like a ladder.
Actually,
Jamie,
if he could pull up,

201
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:32.610
fight for the forgotten.work,
um,

202
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.980
I've actually got something to show in their soup.
Less on there,

203
00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:37.920
which should give a shout out to the cash APP too.
Oh my gosh.

204
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.650
The cash APP is one of my favorite sponsors,

205
00:11:40.651 --> 00:11:45.651
has done an incredible thing in donating $5 to fight for the forgotten.

206
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:48.990
Every time someone signs up and uses the code word Joe Rogan Yup.

207
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:52.680
Which is pretty amazing.
Thousands of dollars from that.
They've built two wells,

208
00:11:52.681 --> 00:11:57.010
more of them or more coming in January,
we're starting to implement,
but um,

209
00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:02.070
cash app came to me and we were trying to do a $50,000 fundraiser to drill a

210
00:12:03.161 --> 00:12:07.050
deep,
deep well,
um,
in Tanzania for the Masai Warriors.
Um,

211
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.390
and we're going to do that with water boys,
which is Chris Lungs Foundation,

212
00:12:10.391 --> 00:12:12.730
Chris long police for the Philadelphia Eagles.
He won the Superbowl,

213
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.090
donate his entire salary.
Really great guy,

214
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.220
climbed Mount Kilimanjaro with him and we are partnering together to help this

215
00:12:18.221 --> 00:12:22.000
village to get 7,500 people clean water.
So it's about $6 per person.

216
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:26.560
I started posting about that and Gary Mcmanus from cash app hit me up and was

217
00:12:26.561 --> 00:12:29.510
just like,
hey,
we want to do something big with you guys.
Um,

218
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.660
and we already had another $50,000 donor that was being anonymous and cash up

219
00:12:33.661 --> 00:12:36.790
came in and said,
hey,
we're going to match that $50,000 match you have.

220
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:40.450
So cash APP gives $50,000 if we could raise 50,000.

221
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:45.730
And so we ended up raising 50,000,
52,000,
600,
$25,
and then,

222
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:49.930
uh,
and then it was tripled.
So it,
it came out to being 150,

223
00:12:49.931 --> 00:12:54.931
2,625 and a cash app gave us $50,000 because they believe in the mission and

224
00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.840
vision of fight for the forgotten.
They believe in you.

225
00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:01.100
They believe in this community.
Um,

226
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.020
and me and I absolutely love cash app.
The,
in fact,

227
00:13:05.021 --> 00:13:07.780
on this crowdfunding tournament we're doing,
um,

228
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:12.490
on the website fight for the forgotten.org/heroes.

229
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:15.370
We're doing a heroes in waiting crowdfunding tournament.

230
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.880
And so we're inviting in a hundred martial arts academies in a hundred

231
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:22.930
individuals to help us raise 4,000,
$200.

232
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.960
So yeah,
we're doing it through December 31st.

233
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.000
So we're given us quite a bit of time,

234
00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.660
but what we're going to be doing is the crowdfunding tournament is going to fund

235
00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.410
a wells.
So we will transform a community with a $4,200,

236
00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.980
and it will equip their martial arts academy with a bullying prevention

237
00:13:38.981 --> 00:13:41.990
curriculum.
So they'll just amazing by the way.
Yeah.
Yeah.

238
00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:46.440
Everything that you could ever ask for,
uh,
to help,
uh,

239
00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:50.740
pass that knowledge along and increase your program,
you know,
help your school,

240
00:13:50.741 --> 00:13:54.400
bring more kids in,
uh,
make a bigger impact.
Um,

241
00:13:54.401 --> 00:13:57.940
so not only are you helping the kids,
but then you're also raising money,
uh,

242
00:13:57.941 --> 00:14:02.740
inside the academy to help towards,
um,
you know,
the fight for the forgotten.
Yeah.

243
00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:06.080
And uh,
it's,
it's gonna be a thing where,
so it's,

244
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.750
there's 12 weeks of Mat chat topics and I love it because he rose in waiting and

245
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.480
talks about,
hey,
everyone is a hero in waiting.
And what is a hero?

246
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:17.950
A hero is someone who sees a need and takes action immediately.

247
00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:22.510
And so we're teaching the kids that,
hey,
guess what?
87% of the time.

248
00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:25.840
Whenever you see bullying and you say something,
it can be as easy as,
hey,

249
00:14:25.841 --> 00:14:29.650
that's not kind.
Or you include the person that's being bullied into your group.

250
00:14:29.651 --> 00:14:33.730
Hey,
come over here.
Um,
within five seconds,
the bullying stops.

251
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.750
87% of the time.
All you have to do is say one thing,
87% of the time,

252
00:14:37.751 --> 00:14:41.050
almost nine out of 10 times you can shut down bullying whenever you see it

253
00:14:41.051 --> 00:14:44.480
happening.
Because here's the problem.
Whenever people think you're,

254
00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.210
when you see bullying happening,

255
00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:49.240
a lot of times you might think you're an innocent bystander,
but,

256
00:14:49.241 --> 00:14:52.160
but your body language and you being around and involved in the bully,

257
00:14:52.161 --> 00:14:55.910
seeing that he takes you being that you're a silent supporter,

258
00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.390
so you're not an innocent bystander.
You're now involved when you see it.

259
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.450
And so you're being a silent supporter if you're not standing up and doing

260
00:15:02.451 --> 00:15:05.900
something about it.
And so we're doing this competition and whoever,

261
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:09.650
whoever's the top crowdfunding a team is going to get there,

262
00:15:09.651 --> 00:15:14.450
Jim renovated by Zebra,
they're going to get $10,000 worth a zebra mats.
Um,

263
00:15:14.451 --> 00:15:18.230
century is going to come in and do $10,000 worth of a gear.

264
00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:22.280
They're going to do gloves,
uh,
head gear,
um,
sparring equipment,

265
00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:27.140
shields the Bob the dummy souplesse is going to do the,
the Bulgarian bag,

266
00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:29.030
uh,
throwing dummy.
Um,

267
00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:33.380
and then the top individual fundraiser is going to get a free home gym from

268
00:15:33.381 --> 00:15:36.220
Zebra and century gear.
Uh,
Bella toward,

269
00:15:36.221 --> 00:15:40.280
just let me know last night that whoever is the top fundraising individual is

270
00:15:40.281 --> 00:15:44.600
going to get flown out,
all inclusive,
um,
to,
uh,

271
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:49.100
to the January 26th,
the heavyweight Grand Prix finale,
uh,

272
00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:53.810
between and Ryan Beta forum at the forum in La.
So you're going to get,

273
00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.840
they're going to get three nights of hotel rooms are going to get their airfare

274
00:15:56.841 --> 00:15:58.160
paid for.
And uh,

275
00:15:58.161 --> 00:16:02.720
so basically what fight for the free is trying to do is raise $420,000

276
00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:03.890
throughout the rest of the year.

277
00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:07.010
And what we'll be able to do with that is hopefully drill equivalent to 100

278
00:16:07.011 --> 00:16:10.010
water wells were served 30,000 people minimum.

279
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:15.220
Hopefully we'll be around 45,000 people with clean water.
And then,
um,
it's,

280
00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.500
it's pretty easy if people go and hit sign up.
Um,
Jamie,

281
00:16:18.501 --> 00:16:22.060
if you could just hit the link.
It's a,
it's sign up.
It,

282
00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:24.770
we're trying to make it really fun to tell people how to get to it.

283
00:16:24.771 --> 00:16:28.810
It's fight for the forgotten.org forward slash.
Heroes.

284
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:32.240
It's forward slash heroes.
And then here,
whenever they go down,

285
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:36.740
you can hit become a fundraiser.
And whenever you become a fundraiser,

286
00:16:36.741 --> 00:16:41.300
you can either create a team,
which we did with Lovato's a couple nights ago.
Um,

287
00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:43.720
you can hit join a team.
So if a team's already created,

288
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:46.520
you can join that team where if you're an individual martial artists or just

289
00:16:46.521 --> 00:16:47.870
someone that's passionate about the cause,

290
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:51.670
you can hit a start fundraising as an individual.
Awesome.
Um,

291
00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:55.730
and then we're going to have a top 10 prizes.
Uh,
basically like prize packs.

292
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:58.810
The top crowdfunding team is going to get a championship belt,

293
00:16:58.811 --> 00:17:01.010
a fight for the forgotten championship belt.
Uh,

294
00:17:01.011 --> 00:17:03.200
two through 10 are going to get championship trophies.

295
00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.830
And then anyone that hits the goal of $4,200 is going to get a fight for the

296
00:17:06.831 --> 00:17:10.850
forgotten gold metal for hitting the goal.
Um,
but the,
uh,
if,

297
00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:13.640
if you actually click out of that and then scroll down,
Jamie,

298
00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.820
you can actually see how it's kind of started a little bit more,

299
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:20.570
but there's a already a few teams while there's four teams now that have signed

300
00:17:20.571 --> 00:17:23.960
up and some of our res,
we haven't announced it yet,
so,
um,

301
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:26.210
there's team Lovato down there,
there's,
and it,

302
00:17:26.211 --> 00:17:29.510
what it will do is we'll show the top team so you can track it and make it

303
00:17:29.511 --> 00:17:32.690
competitive so that you can go on there and make a comment whenever you donate.

304
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:35.630
Um,
but basically,
I guess martial arts and more,
uh,

305
00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:40.310
I do know them if you click on their page.
Um,
it's a guy out of South Carolina,

306
00:17:40.311 --> 00:17:42.450
sorry,
North Carolina,
Jacksonville.
Um,

307
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:45.390
and he just got hit by the hurricane brutally.
Um,

308
00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:49.740
he can't go back into his home for another year,
a year,
year.

309
00:17:49.741 --> 00:17:52.830
He can't go back into his home.
He's living in the academy.
Why a year?

310
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:56.330
His homeowner's association set,
it's going to be like a year of clean up,

311
00:17:56.331 --> 00:18:00.390
fix everything,
fix everything.
That's what it's predicted to be.

312
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:05.580
But he said at $4,200,
he wants to teach his community,
um,

313
00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:10.620
is as James,
right.
And,
uh,
he,
he's wanting to,
you know,
teach the kids that,

314
00:18:10.621 --> 00:18:12.270
hey,
we're still heroes in waiting.

315
00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:15.900
We can still make a difference in our community with bullying prevention and

316
00:18:15.901 --> 00:18:18.180
globally with a community that needs clean water.

317
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:21.600
And so that's what we're trying to do is make a difference in both places.

318
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:26.220
Drill the wells and equip the Martial Arts Academy with bullying prevention.
