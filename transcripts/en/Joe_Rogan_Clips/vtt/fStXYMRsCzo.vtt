1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.370
Uh,
I would imagine no one knows each other better than you guys do

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.450
<v 1>after something like that.
It's pretty nuts.
Yeah.
I mean in,
in man.
Yeah,</v>

3
00:00:08.451 --> 00:00:11.150
they were both knocked down,
drag out wars.
They were crazy.

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.190
I would still say I won second,
second fight,
but I'm very close by.

5
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.900
It was very good,
I will say.
But,
but like I said,

6
00:00:17.901 --> 00:00:22.070
I mean I ran into too many punches.
Um,
you know,
it was,

7
00:00:22.071 --> 00:00:25.490
it was kind of crazy too.
I think I actually spoke to one of the refs,

8
00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:26.001
one of the reps who,

9
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:28.760
who called the fight for Eddie or not one of the restaurant of the judges,

10
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.390
like a couple months after I was at some event and he's like,
oh yeah,

11
00:00:32.391 --> 00:00:33.920
well he rocked you in the second round.
And I was like,

12
00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:35.810
he didn't rock me in the second round.
I tripped,

13
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.610
I basically like tripped and it looked like I got rocked.
Right.

14
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.720
So it's just funny that kind of stuff to this,
this sport is left up to

15
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.250
<v 0>necessarily know what they're doing.
That too.
Yeah.
That's a real problem with me.</v>

16
00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:51.570
I,
I go crazy.
Like,
I remember you talking about a couple fights ago,

17
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.030
he kept saying the one navy.
Yeah.
You're like,

18
00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:58.830
we're not going to say that lady alone.
Yeah,
she's a nice lady.
But look,

19
00:00:58.831 --> 00:00:59.664
man,
it's,

20
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.540
it's just a disgrace that you have people that really don't know anything about

21
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:08.100
martial arts and they're judging martial arts competitions.
I mean,

22
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.410
could you imagine if you had like an,
an ultimate fighting championship,
uh,

23
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.350
eight man tournament with all the judges and have them fight each other.
Right?

24
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.490
You'd be like,
why in the fuck is going on here?
Yeah.
You guys don't even train.

25
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.860
You don't know anything about fighting at all.
They take,

26
00:01:22.861 --> 00:01:25.650
what do they take a test?
I don't really one test,
you know,
I mean,

27
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.340
a lot of them in certain commissions come from boxing.
So they're,

28
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:33.540
they're boxing judges where they boxers or did they tell?
That's a good question.

29
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.200
A lot of them.
No,
no,
I'm mean,
but I think like,

30
00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:40.200
I don't know if Harold Letterman can box.
It does a great job at judging though.

31
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.170
I mean I agree with a lot of his assessments,

32
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.270
but I think boxing is more straightforward.
It's two hands.
Yeah.

33
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.520
You know there's no elbows,
knees take downs.

34
00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:54.180
You don't have to understand Jujitsu.
You don't have to understand wrestling.

35
00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:54.450
You don't,

36
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.140
you don't have to understand when a guy's in trouble versus the guy's not in

37
00:01:58.141 --> 00:02:00.990
trouble in a certain position.
Like how close was that submission?

38
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.730
How many leg kicks is that guy eating?

39
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.420
Why did he switch his stance and he switches dance cause he does that all the

40
00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:10.410
time.
Or is his left leg chewed up?
You know,
they don't know.

41
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.010
They really don't know stuff that you're saying that that people who have seen

42
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:16.880
this border our thinking,
but the judges or have,
you know,

43
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.110
may may or may not have any idea what's going on with them.

44
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.370
A lot of them don't have an idea.
It's a disgrace.
It really is a disgrace.

45
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.500
<v 1>We think that we have sports been around for 20 years now,</v>

46
00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:31.190
25 years now and we're still having this conversation.

47
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.310
<v 0>Boxing has questionable judgments.
Like there's,</v>

48
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.390
there's some questionable calls,
but nothing like MMA.

49
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.420
I think MMA is,
it's disgraceful.
Yeah.

50
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.820
You know the worst one in your opinion,
why wouldn't want an,

51
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.200
I wouldn't want to say oh,

52
00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:51.810
worst one because has been so many fucking terrible ones.

53
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.470
Sometimes it's like a split decision.
Well you'll,
you'll hear one,

54
00:02:55.471 --> 00:02:59.650
you agree with one,
you agree with and one you're like,
what the fuck?

55
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.210
And we're like,
look at each other.

56
00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:04.870
Like I'll look at Anik and I'll look at DC and we like Jesus Christ.

57
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.920
How the fuck did someone think that person won that fight?
Yeah,

58
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.380
it's just bad man.
It's really,
really,
really bad.

59
00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:14.170
And for a God like you who you know,

60
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:18.430
you have a win bonus and a show bonus in the UFC.

61
00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:22.600
So if you're in there and you do everything right and you get robbed,

62
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.710
you didn't just get robbed of a decision and on your record it goes to the lock

63
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.240
and you could,
you know,
you could protest until the cows come home.

64
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.680
Nobody ever gets anything reversed.

65
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.880
Was the last time anybody got a decision reversed?
No,
I can't even remember.
No,

66
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.900
I don't really think it happens.
So they rob you of your win bonus.
I mean,

67
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.420
it could cost you tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.

68
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.590
It's a fucking terrible,
terrible disgrace.
Yeah,
I mean,
and,
and also too,

69
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.890
I've never really even thought about the financials of it.

70
00:03:50.891 --> 00:03:53.140
I never really thought it was always,
to me it was like a wrestling match.

71
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:57.040
It was a loss.
It was a loss of my record.
And then now I look back and I think,

72
00:03:57.041 --> 00:03:59.350
Dang man,
if I would've fought just a little bit different here or that,

73
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.500
or that judge would have saw this with a little bit different,

74
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.870
we're talking a lot of money that I could have in my pocket or would have won,

75
00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:08.530
you know?
So it's,
we've discussed this many times and I think first of all,

76
00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:12.730
the idea of three judges is ridiculous.
Why?
Why only three?
Are they expensive?

77
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.190
Like how fucking you,

78
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.940
you could get some of the best martial arts practitioners in the world to judge

79
00:04:18.941 --> 00:04:20.500
fights and have 10 of them.

80
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.940
And I bet you would have a correct outcome way more often than you would with

81
00:04:24.941 --> 00:04:29.380
three.
Yeah.
You know?
And I just think we need to overhaul that.

82
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:31.510
And for whatever reason,
they're reluctant to do so.
