1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.800
I Dunno.
I Dunno.
It's,
it's,
I,
I honestly,
I would say to an extent,

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.780
there's probably some kind of tribal bias.
Well,

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.180
I think when you're going back to high school yearbooks,

4
00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:13.530
looking for outrage from 55 year old people,
if you've lost the plot,
you've lost.

5
00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:15.450
Isn't that?
Isn't that crazy?
It's fucking insane.
What's,

6
00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:18.450
what's crazier is when Kathy Griffin tweets out that the three point or hand

7
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:21.360
sign at a Covington basketball game was a Nazi hand gesture.

8
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.640
Like the three point or you know,
the 3.9 is this thing.
Yup.
Yeah.
Oh,
see,

9
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.650
I'm not going to do it because the photos a little flying people send me death

10
00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:32.130
threats and a series of them on my Instagram.
When I found out about proof,

11
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.380
I put bill Cosby doing it.
I had someone found one of me from news radio.

12
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.620
Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Aren't they using it though for that symbol?

13
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.560
I know that it's a,
it's a universal symbol.
That means a lot of things.

14
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.740
I'm using it as that symbol there.

15
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.940
They're not using it to mean white power and other not.
All right.

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.930
What are the ones not.
Okay.
What were those cops using it for?
That's the,

17
00:00:51.931 --> 00:00:55.170
that's the,
that's the,
uh,
the,
what is it called?
It's called the okay game.

18
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.670
That don't look game where you put the symbol under your waist and if someone

19
00:00:59.671 --> 00:01:03.900
looks at you get to punch him.
What is,
there's a game kids play?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

20
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.770
The Swat cops that had it on their,
on their legs.
No,
there were all doing it.

21
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.120
There was like four of them doing it in a photograph and holding it up or they

22
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:16.370
holding it on their legs.
Ooh,
I dunno know.
No,
but I don't know.
Let's,
let's,
let's,

23
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.740
let's break this down.
I can explain this to you.
Okay.
Please do.
Donald Trump,

24
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:24.360
when he talks,
he makes the okay hand sign.
He's pointing,
he's making,
I mean,
okay,

25
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.930
if he does it this way,
is that okay?
Oh No,
I already does this.
No,

26
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:30.360
I don't care what Trump does,
what he does,
flex people off.

27
00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:33.670
It's probably a bad thing,
but,
so what happens is he starts doing the,
okay,
10.

28
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.010
Okay sign.
So bunch of Trump supporters start doing it too,
to be like,
Hey,

29
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:41.280
I'm like Trump.
Right,
right.
A four Chan campaign gets started saying,

30
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.490
convince everyone.
That's actually means white power.
Right.
It was fake.

31
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.250
The Anti Defamation League said it was fake.
Yes.

32
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.920
A bunch of journalists said it was real.
That's what I put on my Instagram.
Yeah.

33
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.350
Put all this on my Instagram,

34
00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:55.880
including the article where it showed the original thing came from fortune,

35
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.070
fortune.
It's fucking hilarious.
Powerful.
It's Ho.

36
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.460
It's hilarious how much shit they start.
They started the flat earth movement.

37
00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:05.850
Okay.
There's the guy.
Oh,
is that?
I don't,
I never heard that.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

38
00:02:05.851 --> 00:02:06.760
They started to Futz with it.

39
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.840
Let's look at this photo and see if I can give you a little,

40
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.010
it popped up to conspiracy.
How do we get it back?
It's that what's going on?

41
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.920
The connection to the TV's just died out.
I have no idea.

42
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.160
It's a Hollywood conspiracy.

43
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.870
The button that I have is making it go there and it's not going there,

44
00:02:21.871 --> 00:02:24.620
so I don't know.
Jesus Chamie.
There's Gremlins in this fucking room.

45
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.350
I would figure it out.
It's hard to,
allegedly,
I would say this.

46
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.210
We need to see that though.
90 yeah,
show.
Show me a new laptop.
I would,

47
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.770
I would be willing to,
okay.
There's the image.
Take a good look at it,
Tim.
So,
okay.

48
00:02:37.771 --> 00:02:39.930
These guys,
they see what's on their leg.
Yes.

49
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.700
That's specifically a game where when you look at it,
they get to punch you.
What?

50
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.600
That they're not holding the hand sign up.

51
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.960
They're not flashing it like you see like conservatives do.
Right.

52
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.460
I'm not denying that as a game,

53
00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:54.660
but to say that that's what those guys are doing is a bit of a stretch,

54
00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:58.800
I believe.
Well,
what do you think they're doing?
What does it as to say that if,

55
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.020
if fortune did that to,
to make to,
to mix it up.

56
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.020
At some point people would think that that is true though.

57
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.020
That's like no way that's happening.
I'll say,
this is it.
Is it?
Well,

58
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.140
this would be bleeding free.
Bleeding came from fortunate.

59
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.270
If you don't know what right,
let's explain that to people.
It's all you.
Okay.

60
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.060
Free bleeding was fortunate.
I thought it would be hilarious.
By the way,

61
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:24.910
Shiela bu was at the fucking comedy store last night.
I wonder why,

62
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.730
because we're always ragging on him.
Um,

63
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.980
free bleeding came from four Chan where they said that they were,

64
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.910
they were promoting this idea that for women's rights that they would,
you know,

65
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:37.930
get away with their clothes,

66
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.800
get away from this whole idea of you have to control your menstrual cycle.

67
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.980
You know,
it's empowering to just bleed all over your crunch.

68
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.880
And so women actually started doing it because it actually,

69
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.440
if you can fucking,
if you can get those ideas out there,

70
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.650
a certain number of knuckleheads are going to take it and run with it and think

71
00:03:56.651 --> 00:03:57.371
it's real.
Of course.

72
00:03:57.371 --> 00:03:59.410
So you don't think that's possible with the white power though?

73
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.670
I think it's extremely unlikely.
I think it's,
it's possible.
So here's the thing,

74
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:05.440
nothing's absolute right.
Are there some,

75
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:07.870
some white supremacists who are doing it for sure,
but you don't,

76
00:04:07.871 --> 00:04:10.600
you think you're looking at bad asses with fucking guns.

77
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.800
They're playing this little silly game.
Yeah.
Really.

78
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.950
I think there are a bunch of bros.
Who are you ever,
do you ever hang out with?

79
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:22.510
Like some Frat dudes at a college,
they punch each other.
That's there's a game.

80
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.200
So how does it go again?
You,
you make the okay hand sign.
Okay.
And you hold it.

81
00:04:26.201 --> 00:04:28.540
These are a table or on on your leg.
These are adults.

82
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:30.100
These are guys that are not in college.

83
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.210
They're definitely not a below 25 years old.
But what does that mean?
I know,

84
00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:37.530
I know 40 year old guys who play Pokemon,
I know belongs to them and go,

85
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.500
this is a game that fix this fucking thing.
Well I don't.
That's okay.

86
00:04:41.501 --> 00:04:45.640
But what the general,
what is their job?
What would they their swat team guys?

87
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.890
Is that what they did?
They were arresting a drug dealer.
And what do you,

88
00:04:47.891 --> 00:04:48.551
what do you think they're doing?

89
00:04:48.551 --> 00:04:50.260
They're trying to make sure everybody knows that they're there.

90
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.940
They're flashing and overt white power,

91
00:04:51.941 --> 00:04:54.090
hand gesture because everyone knows that's what it means.
That's,

92
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.760
I didn't think everyone knew well now that's just not,
it's just not the case.

93
00:04:57.761 --> 00:05:02.650
The thing,
the point is holding the,
okay,
sign up next to you is what's key.

94
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.570
You know,
people say it's the w in the peat,

95
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.960
putting it on your leg has always been the punch him game or whatever.

96
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.740
Like I don't know,
I know that punch him,
punch him,
gave 100%,

97
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.540
you put it at the okay symbol on your leg or under a table and you say,
hey look.

98
00:05:16.541 --> 00:05:18.670
And if they look at it and see it,
they go ah,
and then you punch him in the arm.

99
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.460
But I know it so well that I,

100
00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:23.950
that's why I don't think that's what they're doing like me and my friends.

101
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:24.850
So one of the lay it.

102
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:29.620
So then the question is it's a major look made you look major.
Look right.
So,

103
00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.280
but what are they doing right?
Look,
look,
listen man.
If you want to,

104
00:05:33.281 --> 00:05:35.980
if you want to make assumptions about what you think their intentions were,

105
00:05:35.981 --> 00:05:37.960
that's all you.
I don't have any facts to support that.

106
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.230
And the only thing I know of is there as a game where you put the okay sign in

107
00:05:41.231 --> 00:05:42.520
your leg and then you punch somebody.

108
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.140
And here's some guys putting the okay sign in their leg.

109
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.230
What evidence do we have?
It's anything other than that.
Nothing.
So that,
that's,

110
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.320
I'm not going to go any further than that.
I'm going to say,
was it poor judgment?

111
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.360
Oh hell yeah.
Maybe.
But listen,

112
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.360
do you know about what happened in Philly with these marines who got beat up by

113
00:05:55.361 --> 00:06:00.260
Antifa?
No,
I do not.
So there's some,
so there was a,
a rally put on by some,
uh,

114
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.260
constitutional libertarians.
I don't know exactly what it was all about.

115
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.210
Antifa shows up in protests.

116
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.650
Some marines apparently are just walking by because there was a marine event.

117
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.120
Antifa sees them and yells,
are you proud?
They said,
he says,

118
00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:17.690
I'm a marine and said,
are you a proud boy?
And he said,
you know,
I don't know.

119
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.940
They beat him up.
These,
uh,

120
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.610
they arrested several people charged with multiple felonies.
Marines got beat up.

121
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.410
They didn't know it.
Proud boy was.

122
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.330
So to assume that these guys know anything about what's going on in in cultural

123
00:06:29.331 --> 00:06:33.110
politics.
It's,
it's,
you know when you're in the know and you're on Twitter,

124
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.450
when you're reading the news all day,
you look at the insight,

125
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.530
they knew what they were doing,

126
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.620
what these are small like what city of these guys from even do they watch the

127
00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:41.180
news all day?
Do they go on four Chan,

128
00:06:41.181 --> 00:06:44.660
do they go on vox.com and read and know what this is about?
Okay.

129
00:06:44.661 --> 00:06:48.470
I appreciate your looking at this with a broad perspective,

130
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.680
but it is entirely possible that the did,
sure.

131
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.440
It's also entirely possible that within their friend group it means you're

132
00:06:54.441 --> 00:06:57.170
buying lunch.
It could mean a million things.
It could mean,

133
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.380
but in the cultural context of 2018 when this happened.

134
00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:07.460
Yup.
That,
oh the okay symbol doesn't even mean white power.
It is,
is,
it is.

135
00:07:07.461 --> 00:07:12.461
It is a tribal sign among anti anti intersectional and Trump supporters.

136
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.830
But don't you remember when w was there?

137
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.600
There was a woman that got in trouble for,

138
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.790
she was in court and she had it on her arm.

139
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.700
She was just standing there like some insane,

140
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.310
so insane because she was basically,
she had her finger and her thumb like that.

141
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.800
Yeah.
They said and they,
and they went wild with it.
Yeah.

142
00:07:27.801 --> 00:07:28.870
She's making somebody powers.

143
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.420
You have to understand when I see that and I see that you kicked me out,

144
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.360
but there's a difference between someone just moving their hands around and

145
00:07:35.361 --> 00:07:37.910
doing this and you know,
making a weird thing she did.

146
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.700
She did fall on do it the next day though.
Probably on purpose.

147
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.640
Maybe that's what she does when she puts it on there.

148
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.170
You have to assume she's watching the news then I would,

149
00:07:48.171 --> 00:07:50.540
she's sitting at the cabin out hearing.
But it's entirely possible though.

150
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:55.490
I'll be an unlikely that she was just telling somebody.
Okay.
Like,
or she was,

151
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.540
she's used to doing that with her arm.
There's new,
think about it.
There's,

152
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:03.290
you're allowed to make assumptions,
right.
And operate off assumptions.

153
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:07.940
But eventually you start getting off so crazy and you know how many assumptions

154
00:08:07.941 --> 00:08:09.860
are going to believe until you're believe in the moon.
Landing was fake.

155
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:10.880
Let me ask you this though.

156
00:08:10.881 --> 00:08:15.560
Don't you think that some people do that and they do it because they're making

157
00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:18.560
the symbol for white power?
Some as in what,

158
00:08:18.561 --> 00:08:22.970
10 1520 I don't know.
I think,
I don't know about,
and like I said,
listen,

159
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.290
nothing's absolute.
I'd be,

160
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.020
I'm pretty sure there are probably some white supremacists who do that.

161
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.710
But here's the thing,
most of these people who are on four Chan,

162
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.890
who would even use the Emoji who would do it in public,

163
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.050
they're not doing it to signal white power.

164
00:08:36.051 --> 00:08:40.940
They're doing it a signal opposition to the tribal left when they take photos

165
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:44.690
and you see someone like Cassandra Fairbanks who is a Trump supporting,
you know,

166
00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:48.800
writer.
She has,
she,
she is,
she's notable because she stood at the podium,

167
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:54.070
made the okay hand sign and then this writer from splinter news,
which uh,

168
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.010
used to be called fusion worked there,
full disclosure,

169
00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.720
claimed it was a white power hand gesture and she,
she got Kasandra sued over it.

170
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:04.650
She ultimately lost,
cause it's like,
you know,
free slander is hard to sue for.

171
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.460
But she did it because it was a Trump sign.
Not because it's white power.

172
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.840
So the people who were even white supremacists aren't signifying white power.

173
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.240
They're signaling to other Trump supporters too.
Right?

174
00:09:15.241 --> 00:09:17.150
It doesn't mean white power.
Right.

175
00:09:17.151 --> 00:09:20.360
So just because someone on the left says it means,
why power,

176
00:09:20.361 --> 00:09:22.670
that does not mean it means why power within their group.

177
00:09:22.671 --> 00:09:24.190
Is that what you're saying?
Yeah.

178
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.630
Just like we all just decide that this means something else.

179
00:09:26.631 --> 00:09:30.080
Like my friend means a piece among peers,
among nations,
my peace among worlds.

180
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.210
My friend Steve Rinella.
Uh,

181
00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.420
we talked about this in the podcast that he got beat up wants by his friend

182
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:36.710
where uh,

183
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:41.390
he grew up in Michigan and in Michigan as almost like for fun.
Like,

184
00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:45.890
like if I said,
hey fucker,
like if I called you,
hey fucker,
like as friends.
Yeah.

185
00:09:45.891 --> 00:09:48.260
You would laugh and be like,
what's up dude?
You know,
it'd be cool.

186
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:52.460
So he would give the bird and they would call it the Michigan.
Hello?
Yup.

187
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.410
And so the Michigan wave or something like that.

188
00:09:54.411 --> 00:09:58.490
So as he's driving by saw as for anyone like that,
like if I saw you do that,

189
00:09:58.491 --> 00:10:01.070
I'd be like,
Eh,
what's up Tim?
There was a,
but you don't have to,

190
00:10:01.071 --> 00:10:03.860
but his friend didn't know this,
so his friend,

191
00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:05.810
he grabbed him through to the ground.
He goes,

192
00:10:05.811 --> 00:10:08.060
you want to fight motherfuckers like,
what are you talking about?

193
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:11.480
Like what's going on?
He's like,
you gave me the bird.
He's like,
oh Jesus,
Bro,

194
00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.170
I'm from Michigan.
Yeah,
like that's we're having fun.
Like that's just,

195
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:20.000
I'm your friend and he was over the guy's house helping them build a greenhouse

196
00:10:20.001 --> 00:10:22.430
or something.
Like he was doing some work with the guy.

197
00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.910
I think I still threw him to the ground because he thought that this was,
oh,

198
00:10:25.911 --> 00:10:29.430
you got it fixed.
No,
there's naturally,
there's going to be a ton of people,

199
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:34.000
you know saying,
Oh,
tombs boot licker and all that stuff.
It's like premises men.

200
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.220
Like I'm not,
I,
I do not.
I'm not a big fan of conspiracy theories.

201
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.190
I'm not a big fan of making assumptions about the intentions of other people.

202
00:10:41.191 --> 00:10:42.660
If you can prove it,
I'm willing to hear it.

203
00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.600
But people in this country are innocent till proven guilty.
What do we have?

204
00:10:45.601 --> 00:10:47.070
We have a photo of some cops doing something dumb.

205
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.130
Do I think it was ill advised it was wrong.
I should have done it.
Well of course.

206
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.530
Absolutely should have done it.
Do I think it means they're white supremacists?

207
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:56.490
No,
the tops.
Look,
I've,
I,

208
00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.760
I am no fan of police.
I,
you know,

209
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:03.080
I grew up as like a left far left anarchist skateboarder.

210
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.330
The cop screw with me all the time.
I've had cops kicked my door,
guns drawn.

211
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.570
I was in Chicago and cops pulled me over.
Me and my buddies,

212
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.240
this is all on video at gunpoint screaming at us.

213
00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.180
It was the craziest experience I've ever had.
I am no fan,

214
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.280
but if you don't have evidence,

215
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.700
I'm not just going to say this is a thing about how,
how these biases function.

216
00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.740
You get people who will see all these videos,

217
00:11:22.741 --> 00:11:25.380
live these experiences and they immediately assume the worst about these guys.

218
00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:27.900
I don't know anything about these guys.
I know they did something dumb,

219
00:11:27.901 --> 00:11:28.734
but I don't know why.

220
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.370
So I can't really go beyond that other than I believe their official statement

221
00:11:32.371 --> 00:11:35.400
was there playing the game.
But I could be wrong,
but to,

222
00:11:35.401 --> 00:11:38.100
to make assumptions about their character or what they believe simply because

223
00:11:38.101 --> 00:11:39.450
they made an okay sign on their leg.

224
00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:44.410
It's like you can't convict somebody in a court.
You know what I mean?
And I'm,

225
00:11:44.411 --> 00:11:48.450
I'm a big fan of the presumption of innocence and Blackstone's formulation and

226
00:11:48.451 --> 00:11:51.600
how we side on the,
uh,
we,
we err on the side of protecting the innocent.

227
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:56.440
But I think you got a good point in also in the fact that this is a extremely

228
00:11:56.441 --> 00:12:01.441
recent hand gesture that's being associated with white supremacy and clearly

229
00:12:01.871 --> 00:12:04.930
came from pranksters.
And you have to assume these guys are on four Chan or,

230
00:12:04.931 --> 00:12:07.720
or read these,
these websites.
Like,
come on man,
these dudes,

231
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.150
they probably go to work all day.
They talk about football,
they go home,

232
00:12:10.151 --> 00:12:13.210
they sit in their lounge chair and have a beer and a slice of pizza or whatever

233
00:12:13.211 --> 00:12:17.140
it is they do.
I don't think these guys,
people,
man,
you know,

234
00:12:17.141 --> 00:12:20.650
people don't know how to separate their own personal bubble from reality.

235
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:25.440
They assume if I know it,
you must know it.
Right?
It's actually something,
uh,

236
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.270
Shane Smith told me,
he said he doesn't understand.

237
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:32.200
Why is it that if he can do it,
you can't.
Right.
And that's,

238
00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.740
it's like an interesting point that people don't seem to realize you mean by

239
00:12:34.741 --> 00:12:37.030
that?
Like he's,
he's had to me,
I can speak French.

240
00:12:37.031 --> 00:12:41.650
Why can't you like people live in this mindset where they assume,
if I know it,

241
00:12:41.651 --> 00:12:45.160
everyone knows it.
Right.
Okay.
So,
so they're going to be like,
no,
every,

242
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:48.160
I saw an article about that.
Everyone must know what it is.
It's like,
no,
no,
no.

243
00:12:48.161 --> 00:12:50.170
Dude.
There are some people who don't watch TV.

244
00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.940
There are some people play video games all day.

245
00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:55.870
There's some people who don't do any of that for all,
you know,
these guys,
they,

246
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.280
every day after work,
they go to a children's shelter and,

247
00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.250
and provide soup and they don't watch the news at all.
Like I'm not,

248
00:13:01.251 --> 00:13:02.890
I don't believe that they actually do.
I'm just saying,

249
00:13:02.891 --> 00:13:04.210
you have no idea what's going on in their lives.

250
00:13:04.211 --> 00:13:07.750
You're making assumptions about what they know,
who they are.
And I think,

251
00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.340
you know,
I,
I,

252
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:12.580
I'm a firm believer that we have problems with racism in this country.
I believe,

253
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.640
uh,
institutional and systemic racism,
real,
real problems need to be solved.

254
00:13:15.641 --> 00:13:16.474
All that stuff.

255
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:20.290
That still doesn't mean you get to just label someone and make assumptions about

256
00:13:20.291 --> 00:13:24.680
what they believe,
who they are because of one thing.
You know,
if,
if,

257
00:13:24.681 --> 00:13:26.800
if you've made a,
if you made a joke,
what if,

258
00:13:26.801 --> 00:13:29.160
what if they did it because they were ironically doing it right?

259
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:32.080
If you made a joke 10 years ago,
am I going assume you actually believe that?

260
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.590
Maybe said something silly.
You know,
we had this newscaster in New York who,

261
00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:40.550
who accidentally said Martin Luther,
you know,
uh,
and I,

262
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.510
and I,
and at that point again,
you know,
I was like another one.
Yep.
Sullen.

263
00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.500
And you also,
uh,

264
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:48.580
and another thing happened that no one cared about was a guy on CNN said a

265
00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:52.690
racial slur for Jewish people in the same way.
No one cared about that one,

266
00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:57.490
you know?
So there was a CNN anchor.
What did he say?
I don't want to say it.
Okay,

267
00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:59.910
but he was,
he was his k word,
right?

268
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.840
I think you can still say it as long as I'm going to call me.

269
00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.410
It was the same thing.
He quickly fit,
corrected himself.

270
00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:10.500
And that didn't come up as an issue.
But the point is this dude,
you know why?

271
00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.210
Why is he being fired?
Right,
right.

00:14:13.211 --> 00:14:15.070

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:18.370

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.530
We don't know the context.
We don't know who these people are.

275
00:14:20.531 --> 00:14:22.780
What are their names?
And we're going to be like burnt at the stake.
