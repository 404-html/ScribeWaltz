Hello Freak bitches.
Yeah,
I've had people get upset at me about um,

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.990
talking about,
uh,
upcoming martial arts fights because a,

3
00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:12.150
I don't give predictions.
I very,
very,

4
00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:15.990
very rarely give predictions unless there's some gross mismatch.

5
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:19.260
It really shouldn't be happening in the first place because you really have no

6
00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:22.620
idea what's going to happen and there's a high likelihood that something might

7
00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:23.041
happen.

8
00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:28.041
If I look at the way one guy moves versus another guy moves and I go into my

9
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.100
database of experiences of seeing a lot of live competition and knowing what one

10
00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:38.100
person is capable of,
I can make,

11
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.060
I can make a statement with reasonable certainty but I don't know if they were

12
00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:47.430
injured in training.
I don't know if they come into the fight sick.

13
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.740
I don't know if they're breaking up with their girlfriend.

14
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.810
I don't know if they got staph infection two weeks before the fight and run

15
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.130
ended up biotics.
There's so many variables.

16
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.640
I don't know if they might get headbutted like we talked about earlier or they

17
00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:02.280
might have an injury like in the middle of the fight,

18
00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:05.550
like something goes wrong and their knee blows out.
There's so many variables.

19
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.720
Has the thing between the boxer and the MMA guy happened to get the thing?
See,

20
00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:14.220
this is,
I love when someone is consoles.
I know.
I love that though.
No,
I'm not.

21
00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:17.280
I'm not criticizing you.
But I love when someone is so far removed,

22
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.480
but there's still aware of something that's like a big cultural event.
No,

23
00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:24.630
it takes place August 26 I think even,

24
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.630
I'm an unbelievable novice when it comes to this stuff.

25
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.980
I think I could make a prediction here in front of your huge podcast that the

26
00:01:31.981 --> 00:01:34.920
MMA guy is going to get trashed.
Correct.
Um,

27
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.010
I would imagine that most likely he is going to lose a boxing match to the best

28
00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:46.140
boxer that has ever lost this fight.
Just for,
for my name thing,

29
00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:49.950
if you wanted to see a figure skater play hockey against Wayne Gretzky.

30
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.511
Okay.

31
00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:56.370
So why would the MMA guy put himself up for that potential humiliation,

32
00:01:56.371 --> 00:02:01.200
money,
dollar,
dollar bills?
Y'All been on your show?

33
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.860
No,
he has not.
I fucked up.
I should have had him on back before he blew up.

34
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.360
He's too big now.
I referred to him as a Conrad last time or something.
Right.

35
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.280
Something like that.
His name is Connor.
Connor Mcgregor.
Yeah.
Um,
I,
uh,

36
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.400
it's,
he's a,
a real meteoric,
uh,

37
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.850
entity and like the most media or can all of combat sports.

38
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.360
He became so famous so quick and for cause he's a,

39
00:02:27.361 --> 00:02:29.480
he's a real unicorn in a lot of ways.

40
00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:33.240
It's got so many different things going for him.
Handsome guy,

41
00:02:33.241 --> 00:02:37.440
brutal knockout artists,
predicts outcomes and pulls them off.

42
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.970
And uh,
it has been incredibly successful in a short period of time.
One,

43
00:02:41.971 --> 00:02:46.650
two world titles in two different weight classes and is arguably the greatest

44
00:02:46.651 --> 00:02:50.170
trash-talker ever.
He trashed talks better than anybody.
Is that right?

45
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.360
There is actually a big thing that's going on today,
right?
The press conference,

46
00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:57.540
actually I'm reading the thing that scalping tickets outside of it for 40 bucks

47
00:02:57.541 --> 00:03:01.420
right now to 40.
It's a free,
it was free.
Oh,

48
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.250
my nephew is probably all over that stuff,
right?
Probably.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's,

49
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.990
um,
it's,
um,

50
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.640
it's the press conference itself will be a show because this guy is so good at

51
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:16.600
getting people riled up and talking shit.
And that's half the fun.
Like,

52
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.560
I was too young to appreciate the Muhammad Ali days,

53
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.850
but I would imagine that like when Muhammad Ali was challenging Sonny Liston,

54
00:03:24.851 --> 00:03:28.750
like half of the fun was Mohammed Ali talking shit.
Like,

55
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:30.010
this guy's crazy.
Like,

56
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.880
<v 1>okay.</v>
