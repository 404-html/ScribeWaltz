WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.490
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.800
We're just trying to get our money look at before and after.
That's crazy.

3
00:00:05.801 --> 00:00:10.230
As Christ 2009 to 2016 whoa.
That's amazing.

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.190
Testosterone is real people.
That's more testosterone.
That's that.

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.570
That's the job,
but not having,
it's real too,
for sure.
Yeah.

6
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.450
Tough mentally to,
yeah.
There's not much you can do either.

7
00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:25.830
The other thing about it is like once your body doesn't produce anymore and

8
00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:28.740
you're in your late thirties like that and you've been juicing for a long time,

9
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.150
there's like Clomid and stuff that tries to,
or eight to eight CT or HTC.

10
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.780
What is true?
Is that a mood that's a cell phone either way,
hcg or something,

11
00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:39.030
whatever it is,
but it's supposed to boost your testosterone naturally,

12
00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:42.360
but never to the levels when you're injecting that John,
but juice,
no.

13
00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:47.040
Not only that though.
You can't take that stuff off UFC.
Right.
It's illegal.

14
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.350
I'm just saying.
Well,
yeah,
that's true.
When I guess when he retires,

15
00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:52.600
he can do whatever the fuck he wants.
Yeah.

16
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.770
When he retires or goes to rise in Kim.

17
00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.750
Imagine Ufc let him out of the contract and then all of a sudden he disappears

18
00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:05.730
for like eight months and just we're here just locked in the house with horse

19
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.450
meat back,
just just filet of horse all day.

20
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.960
He's eating that Canelo meat and goes back to dead lift and hanging out with

21
00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:13.794
power lifters.

22
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.200
Steps out of the fucking house in Holland six months later take tied around two

23
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.690
97 yes.
Yeah.
I want that journey for him.

24
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.050
I want that because I went on board of that train is only one way can happen

25
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.351
dude.

26
00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:29.220
How about Kelly and hot for fucking Clenbuterol and they're saying it's in the

27
00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:32.820
meat in Mexico.
It is a small trace amounts and everyone's like,
oh,

28
00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:36.060
the fights off.
Trust me,
it's boxing.
That flight is not off.

29
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.420
There's way too much money involved.
That is a real fact though,

30
00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:43.200
is that one particular substance he tested positive for exists in meat

31
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.640
Clenbuterol.
Yeah,
and also it's not like a straight steroid.
It's a,
it's,
you know,

32
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.960
guys use it to cut weight and stuff like that and it's such a small trace
amount.

33
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.210
They're going to be fine.
Yeah.
That's such a great fight.
Triple g canola man.

34
00:01:54.211 --> 00:01:56.990
It's a very good fight and it's way better than the first one.
Cinco de Maya.

35
00:01:56.991 --> 00:01:58.850
Why do you think it's going to be better?
I,
cause I,

36
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.000
I think triple g didn't fight like himself.
He wasn't,
he has that mix in style.

37
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:05.850
He's a little reserved and then you know,
Canelo was moving too much.

38
00:02:05.851 --> 00:02:09.180
I think now that they're going to be,
we're getting like the real fight now.

39
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.050
I don't,
I don't think the judges fuck this one up.
You never know though.

40
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.110
It's shady.
I loved the first fight.
I loved it.

41
00:02:16.111 --> 00:02:19.950
I thought let me to triple g one it going away though.
I really thought he won.

42
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.490
Me Too.
I think a lot of people did.
A lot of people thought that was a poor draw.

43
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.490
That's why I think,
you know,
Chit with g coming off,

44
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.950
you know that drawl now there's a lot more hype with everyone's getting tuned
in.

45
00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:31.710
The ratings are going to be better.
And my boxing judges,
you know,

46
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.180
they're crooked.
MMA is nowhere near as bad,
but bots like did you,

47
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.250
did you see the wilder ots fight?
No.

48
00:02:38.251 --> 00:02:41.040
I thought for sure wilder was losing on the cards and like he's going to have to

49
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:44.310
get a finish,
but on actual scorecards they had wild or winning,

50
00:02:44.311 --> 00:02:46.200
which off see they want wilder to win.

51
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.640
Which was I thought was I was like I did and I'm a wilder Dick Rider.
I'm like,

52
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.670
he's not laying at fight.
MMA might be worse.

53
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.870
And they're the same exact judges saying it's a bad idea is a lot of the same

54
00:02:57.871 --> 00:03:02.440
judges that judge that also are judge box and also judge MMA and they don't even

55
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:03.460
know what MMA is.

56
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.960
You UNDC trying to walk that tight rope of not clown and what's her name?

57
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.230
Abalene state bird.
She's a very nice lady.

58
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.840
But as you said,
I'm so,
it was my mom.

59
00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:16.240
I don't want her to fucking piss exactly what Matt judging.

60
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:20.170
That's exactly what I said.
And so fun UTC,
just trying to balance that.

61
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.090
She has no business being in the,
in the note was very nice lady.
But yeah,

62
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.160
she's made some bad decisions.
And she also was a part all in though.

63
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.110
She was also a part of the Canelo Alvarez triple g decision.
That's the problem.

64
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.420
Yeah,
she's balling.
Yeah.

65
00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:36.520
And she was on the wrong side of a couple of decisions that night.

66
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.970
There was some,
there was some bad ones.
Super so site to some that we were like,

67
00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:42.330
what,
how did he win every round wives?

68
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.620
Oh you didn't make any sense like some that some that literally didn't make any

69
00:03:46.621 --> 00:03:50.360
sense each time on the UFC this past weekend there was a lot of bad decision.

70
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.800
Bad ones.
Yeah.
But there was like a couple of split decisions that I was like,

71
00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:57.370
what in the actual fuck is this?
And the weight screws over the fine.

72
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.940
They've knowing the repercussions is such a shitty deal.
Yup.
Yeah.

73
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:03.570
They lose half their money,
their money,
my money.

74
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.150
Cause you don't know what's going on.
And literally the,
there's no recourse.

75
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.050
And if it's a bad decision and there's three people and one person just has

76
00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:13.570
literally no idea what they're doing and they give it to the wrong person,

77
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.990
it's awful man.
It's fucking terrible and it's unnecessary.
Here's the thing,

78
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:19.390
it's unnecessary.
There's way better methods.

79
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.410
And one of the most better methods is one of the better methods is hire someone

80
00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:26.770
who was an actual martial arts expert.
Like I'm Matt Hume or something like that.

81
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.900
Someone to score like,
oh you can,

82
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.970
I'm sure there's a lot of those guys that would do it.

83
00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:33.940
A lot of trainers out there that would do it.
I think.
I agree.

84
00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:35.830
You need to have someone who specializes in mixed martial arts.

85
00:04:35.831 --> 00:04:38.830
She's been around the game.
I don't,
they don't need to be Kate side cause case.

86
00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:41.230
I can't see everything.
And you're also swayed by the crowd.

87
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.650
They shouldn't be in an undisclosed location and they're watching what we see in

88
00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:48.550
judging the fight from the MMA fighters perspective.
I think that's a good point.

89
00:04:48.551 --> 00:04:50.860
And I also think they should be able to see all the replays.
Yes,

90
00:04:50.861 --> 00:04:53.940
they should see all the fight stat.
So they get everything,
get everything,
copies,

91
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.310
strikes and then decide.
But what you're doing now is so old school,

92
00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.230
the only thing that I would disagree with,

93
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:02.260
I don't think they should hear the commentary because I think the commentary can

94
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:04.780
sway.
I'm saying no,
come to calm the crowd noise.

95
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.620
You have three expert MMA and watching going this who was winning cause you're

96
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.840
gonna.
They know what the ground game,
you know for that.
For Tony Ferguson,

97
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.950
Khabib let's say could be takes Tony Down and they think,

98
00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:18.010
oh he has a huge advantage and then Tony just whooping his ass,
throws back,

99
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.740
elbows submission game stand back up can take down.

100
00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:23.500
But on the ground it can be constantly under threat.

101
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.630
How are you going to judge that?
How are yeah,

102
00:05:25.631 --> 00:05:28.720
you gotta know what you're looking at.
I also think three is too small.

103
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.010
I think it should be 10 people,
10 people.
A lot of people can't qualify.

104
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.810
I'm calling.
It's a real shit show.
Alan,
do it all.
Do,
do it all with the Internet.

105
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.010
You didn't even have to be in the building.
Why not be there 10 though?
10 people.

106
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.910
It's harder for three more,
but if there's two that are smart and one that's bad,

107
00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:48.400
you've got to shitty split decision and everybody feels weird about it.

108
00:05:48.401 --> 00:05:49.880
Like what would have happened if there was three more?

109
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.190
So can we say five 10 10 10 you're going to get the right decision almost every

110
00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:58.250
time cause to a few people are going to,
but most people are going to see it.

111
00:05:58.251 --> 00:06:00.420
That one majority is going to see it this way and agree.

112
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.660
And if it's five to five,
you've got to fuck a draw in your hands.

113
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.090
And that's rare.
I'm not mad at that.

114
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.920
And I think sometimes a fight should be a fucking draw and watch it go,

115
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:12.890
man,
that's too close to call.
Don't fuck over Sonia.
And half their pay.

116
00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.460
If there's a drawl,
they both get their wisdom.
That's how we should do.
Exactly.

117
00:06:16.461 --> 00:06:20.300
One guy moves on and the other guy doesn't just arbitrarily so weird.

118
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:21.380
It doesn't make any sense.

119
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.300
Or you get a draw and they have to in the contract they rematch on whatever card

120
00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:26.134
the Rady go again.

121
00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:36.290
<v 1>Okay.</v>
