1
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.750
Gear for it is,

2
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.160
and I wonder how many wrestlers out there looking at in Ghana and going,

3
00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:12.150
I wonder,
I wonder what would happen if you take that guy down.
No,
the,
I mean,

4
00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:14.880
even me being in the same weight class,
I mean that's,
that's my,

5
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.930
my wife was asking him,

6
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.830
who would you be more terrified to fight before the fight?
You know,

7
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.850
I'm a steward,
I'm going to be 62.

8
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.440
We can get you down to a five that you go on key.
Oh yeah.

9
00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:28.110
But when the Overeem and him where we're facing off,
she's like,

10
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:30.390
which one would you prefer to fight?
And I was like,
I think Nick Ghana,

11
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.770
I think Francis,
yeah,
well this was before he pays and uh,

12
00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:39.210
Allister into orbit.
But uh,
I,
because he'd take him down to come down and then,

13
00:00:39.211 --> 00:00:40.470
uh,
and then it's your game.

14
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.700
Hopefully Allister's so seasoned and everything else.

15
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.200
He does have some takedown defense and he does have some submissions,

16
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.320
so I've just seen him be more well rounded.
And uh,
so,

17
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:56.070
but that was before this outcome for,
yeah,
obviously.
Yeah.

18
00:00:56.071 --> 00:00:59.490
I would've talked to you before that.
And I said,
no,
no,

19
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.000
because my thought before the fight when I talked to shop shop and I would talk

20
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:05.610
on the phone,
he said,
what do you think's going to happen?
I think,
I think he's,

21
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.620
I think Allister doesn't make it out of the first round.

22
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.210
We went over all the Times Alistair's been stopped.
That's a big factor.

23
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:14.550
It was a big factor isn't it?
More than 10 times.

24
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.160
More than 10 times in MMA I think it was,

25
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:21.420
what was it like 12 times 13 times in MMA and then three or four times in

26
00:01:21.421 --> 00:01:24.180
kickboxing as well.
Once that analogy,
is there any truth to it?

27
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.400
It's almost like a peanut butter jar or something.

28
00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:29.580
The first time you open it you got to get out a towel and put over it and tried

29
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.600
really hard to,

30
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.630
to open that lid and then after that it's a little easier and then it's a little

31
00:01:34.631 --> 00:01:37.620
easier until eventually you do it enough and you can just spin it off.

32
00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:42.210
Just flick it,
you know,
while he's in the flick at stage,
but it doesn't matter.

33
00:01:42.211 --> 00:01:44.130
That punch would knocked him out when he was 20.

34
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.020
Oh yeah though knocked anyone out.
That hunch was in marketing tour.
Roy Nelson,

35
00:01:49.021 --> 00:01:51.600
either either those guys and the way he threw it,

36
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.630
it was like a leg like from the thigh and then whipping that arm with the whole

37
00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:02.790
body behind it.
Just full torque.
I mean it had everything.

38
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.730
It had all the power.
I was a little skeptical of the oil.

39
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.040
It was probably from listening to Brendon,
but talk about the punching power.
Uh,

40
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.440
you know,

41
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.190
well who else has Mark Hunt headed and has cro cop kicked it and everything
else.

42
00:02:14.191 --> 00:02:16.950
And then all of a sudden once you see that punch,
like he,
he's,

43
00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:18.060
he sealed the deal dude.

44
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.070
Ivy Calm boy's hand and it's like holding hands with a fucking cinder block.

45
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.920
Let's see that again.
Boom.

46
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.800
See how he like comes up from the thigh and the arm whips up look this way.

47
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.180
Oh my goodness.
And he's an easy,
as he's punching,

48
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.760
he's moving in position to punch a second time.

49
00:02:38.761 --> 00:02:43.470
Then he Hammerfest some ways out bone.
Thank goodness he got in there.

50
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.980
He certainly,
I mean,
the referee got in as quick as he could,

51
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.570
but he certainly could have not hit him while he was down.
He was out cold.
