Speaker 1:          00:01          What was this movie in Thailand? Uh, is my buddy as Seth green was a, he wrote and directed a movie. And so he asked me to do something in it and you know, like, cause I don't really pursue acting like at all off kind of thing. And I'm not saying it was a favor or anything like that, but at the same time it was like, yeah, it sounds like fun. So, uh, schoolcast it's like him, uh, he's in a brick and Myers and it, uh, Brenda Song, uh, me. So do you just like do whatever you want these days and just occasionally act when it comes up? Yeah, if it comes up, like, you know, if it's a cool look, neat little gig or something like that, like, yeah, sure. But, uh, like I said, I don't pursue it in any kind of like any way. Like I don't have agents anymore and things like that.

Speaker 1:          00:39          Is that because you're just not interested or not interested? I don't really like the, uh, the pursuit of it, you know, like, yeah, like what it takes to assess. Exactly. I don't like being on the circuit kind of thing looking at. Yeah. So, uh, but yeah, no, I um, you know, I write a lot, I paint a lot. Like I just kind of always have some kind of projects. And then also, uh, like I said, we've got the website, a bunny ears.com kind of thing. And what does that, that is a, it's a comedy website. It's pretty much, uh, like, uh, like, you know how all these celebrities, especially like ladies, they have those, uh, lifestyle websites. All of them. Well, a lot of them do, you know, look. Yeah, like Goop, you know, just one of them. Is there other ones? Oh yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:19          No, it's okay. It's a goop ones. The most egregious though. Yeah. Well that's the thing, is that, so this is, this isn't like goop meets the onion soup is like goop meets the onion. Yeah, I knew all yet, but accident it accidentally, you know? Yeah. They're telling you to put jade balls up your vagina. I know. Believe me, we had an years. Yeah, we have an, we have an article beach in a hot, hold on. What does that just do? That thing. Oh, annoying. Yeah. How to have sex on the beach in a hot tub and other things that seemed fun as a virgin. It's Hannah, Hannah and Michael. He's a hunter. She's a fantastic writer. You've got to look a little scroll and things like, say you have a podcast as well. Yeah, we do a podcast also. Um, and we, we have, we're revving up some, uh, more like video content and things, but uh, yeah, so this is just a fun project.

Speaker 1:          02:07          It's got a lot of really great writers, like comedy writers and stuff. Yeah. It's kind of just like, oh, like there's a good article about a jade egg. Like, oh, I put a jade egg up my vagina and I catch a jade bird, you know, like that kind of thing. You're like, you know, and then like, you know what to do about your bird living in your vagina. Now look at like, it's like, you know what I mean? We're, we're kind of like taking the piss out of like, you know, some of these kind of like lifestyley websites, you know, it's like, um, it's like, you know, they'll have articles like on coop about like, oh, the best cabernets like for like $200 or something. That, and it's like, ours is like the best Bourbon's under $20, but then like a turn, like the spelling gets worse and worse, and then it turns into a rant about your ex girlfriend.

Speaker 1:          02:47          So like things like that, it's, it's, it's some really good stuff. Like I said, we have a really, really great team of people and uh, yeah, it's, it's kind of like I said, taking the piss out of things. And so you just decided to do this just for fun? Yeah, I kind of had this idea, it was kind of kicking it around and so forth. And then I felt like I kind of accumulated enough ideas and then, uh, yeah, then I start kind of vultron in it. Like, just grabbing the assembling, you know, like this, this, this, this, this project, this giant, giant robot, you know? Yeah. So there you go. It's, it, it, it's a lot of fun and it's, it is funny, like we have a look. I said there's actually a look. Those articles are really well written, like we have one about, um, uh, do you see infinity war?

Speaker 1:          03:25          Uh, the, the, the, yeah, the vendors. Oh, okay. Yeah, because, oh, it's fantastic. It's fantastic. But were like, we made our own infinity gauntlet. And what happens is like in a spoiler alert, uh, is like, a lot of the people kind of just vanish. Like they kind of just die. Like, you know, they turn into dust in a movie and the movie at the end when you start reading the article, uh, um, uh, all of a sudden just all the words just start vanishing and like, and then you have to go back. And again, it's like a, even like they'll letters, like we actually had a, um, we did one where it was a ransom letter. One of our writers, she, um, her father is actually the therapist for a group, like the extra like psychiatrist, the official one. So we do pass their own therapist, you know?

Speaker 1:          04:09          Yes, but is it like a weekly advice therapist or is it just like therapy just for being on goop? Like I know you're here because you're a mass, so here just read this, read this. It's okay. So we're here for you. So we got pictures of him bound and gagged and it's like dear goop, like we, we kidnapped your therapist. Uh, w you can only get him back if you'd give us your seven hot tips for, you know, yeah. Like, uh, uh, for facial washes for this summer. And you know what? They actually good on them. They responded and they actually like sent us over like a list of like, here are the hot, like kind of like, I was like, you know, good for them. Like they had a sense of humor about the whole thing. Look at again, they have two, they're called coop.

Speaker 1:          04:49          Yeah. We, oh, we almost, we thought about naming ours. Puig uh, that's probably sue. Yeah, I know. I was like, yeah, like, no, no, no. So, um, so you're basically financially set from all those movies. So I do okay for myself, but do you just put that money away and just live off the interest so much? Pretty much, you know? Yeah. And uh, yeah, I've, I'm able to kind of live the life that, you know, like that I, that my circumstances afforded me. I'm, I'm, like I said, I'm very, very, very lucky. You know, lots of weird things happen to kids all the time, all around the world, every day, you know, I have something to show for it, you know, like, yeah. Like, you know, so it's Nice I can live. Um, it's, uh, my buddy jack, he goes to a weird way to describe a movie career.

Speaker 1:          05:34          Yeah. I'm pretty much weird things happen to kids. Yeah. Man, I got some money out of it. Look, I'm, I'm not working like the diamond mines. I'm not a child soldier. You know what I mean? Like I, like I got lucky, I came up the other end, uh, and I have something to show for it. And I'm very like, I do feel blessed every morning kind of thing. Let's say you're happy that it all worked out that one. Yeah. You can go back and do it again when you do it the same way. Uh, knowing what I know now, I mean probably, you know, I probably, yeah, I probably be even more charming.

Speaker 1:          06:01          I do it just better. Of course you would, right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Imagine if you'd just have your brain, a little kid's body. Uh, yeah, I know. I, I would kill it grade school. I would so kill it. Like in school, like, oh, psychological warfare, they wouldn't know what's coming out of fucks. Mr. A little brains up and nuts. Oh, exactly. They would. That would be great. I'm pretty sure that's what a 30 going on 13 was. Right. And that goes up to Jennifer Gardner movie, you know? Yeah. I have no idea what any Jennifer garden wounds are. Well, you know, now you do. Yeah. Going on 13 yeah. Like a a brain swap one kind of. Yes. But she like, yeah. How words or adult brain goes into freaky Friday. You're looking, so it's kind of a freaky Friday with some time travel. I guess so.

Speaker 1:          06:53          Yeah. So you're gonna, you're gonna, you're going to Netflix it tonight, aren't ya? Nope. I can tell it. I can, I can see it. I, you've been thoroughly charmed by, uh, Jennifer Gardner. I can tell him interesting life you have then you, so you just kind of do whatever you want. Yeah. My friend Genx is, I'm a man of leisure. That's the way he described was like my life and lifestyle. That's a good way to describe it. And it's true. And like I kind of looked at him kind of, I'm going to spend some time just like jumping around like Europe or something like that. Like, you know, and just look at like you lived in Paris who were saying, yeah. Lived there for a number of years. I mean, I still have, I still have my place there, but uh, since like 2013, so many that it's only in the last year I've been kind of spending more time in the states.

Speaker 1:          07:33          Was it that brought you to Paris? Well, the food sucks. The wines terrible and the women are ugly, but otherwise it's fantastic. Yeah, no, it's okay. It was an agreeable lifestyle. I did a bunch of friends out there. There was always asking me, when are you gonna move to Paris? And when he learned French, any like your friends in Paris. And I was there just kind of like, I was just kind of jumping around a little bit. And so, um, I, I thought about it for a second and I went, you know what, how's next week?

Speaker 1:          08:05          So I said, I'm going to leave my bags here, I'm going to fly back to New York. I'm going to going, you know, I'll, uh, put my affairs in order. And I said, I'll be back next week. I said, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'm ready to live here. I mean, I realized that if I could pick up and just move to France on a whim, um, and it wouldn't affect like, you know, like anyone's life or it wouldn't hurt anybody. I think that I'd be remiss if I didn't look, you know what I mean? Like, yeah, like how many, how many times in my life, I couldn't do that now, but I could do it back then kind of thing. So it was like, yeah, like, no, I should just fuck it. Look, I'm, I'm good. I'm going to live in Paris now. And it was, it was great.

Speaker 1:          08:38          It was a lot of people who've done that. Johnny Depp lived there for a little while. I know Richard, he still has a place there for a while. No, it's, it's a special place. I mean, what's special about it? Um, I mean again, food and wine's fantastic. Look, the girls are pretty like it. It's the leisurely kind of like lifestyle little bit like I like, I like their eating habits, you know, I get it, it's like a light breakfast and kind of gets heavier as you kind of go along in the day. You kind of eat later, which is kind of like, you know, like, like, oh, you're American, you must want to eat dinner at like eight, eight. I look 10:00 PM 10:00 PM is looking at, you know, kind of a, you know, an ideal like dinner kind of time. Um, they don't like to work hard either.

Speaker 1:          09:19          Right? I mean, no, I mean they, I mean, they, they work, I mean, I think, you know, I like to take their time and everything is like, yeah, it's like, uh, you know, I'll set up a card game for like three 30 and three 30 means like five, you know, again, that's just the way, like everyone's kind of always late, but it's no big deal. That's the thing. It's like, I remember one time coming, I'm like, oh gosh, like, you know, just like, where are they kind of, and then I realized, I'm like, wait, what is the hurry look for real? Like what is the hurry? It's not like I have other plans. My plan is to hang out, like, you know, with you guys. And so, and all of a sudden the stress would just kind of just melt away. I'm like, yeah, like look, you can just be more leisurely and stuff, uh, about things out there and everyone's looking at him. Like I said, it's, it's really cool. They like Americans out there. That's a misconception. And if they don't like, they don't like the loud, obnoxious Americans with the, you know, Mickey mouse tee shirt and the fatty. Yeah, no fanny packs. How dare you.
