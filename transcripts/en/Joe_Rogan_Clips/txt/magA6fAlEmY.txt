Speaker 1:          00:00          Search net gear for Tyron Woodley had some choice words about Colby coven too. Yeah, he was, uh, you know, talking about Colby, like campaigning, hard to get the fight and talking all kinds of crazy shit about him. But Tyron was saying like this, first of all, everything he's saying about our training sessions is 100% bullshit. And he's like, when I get that dude in the octagon, if he ever does get that shot, he goes, I'm going to fuck him up. I said, he was Colby Covington is never going to fight again after he fazes me. That's what he said. Yeah, he was, we were talking before the weigh ins. We were standing around the octagon before the weigh this past UFC in Detroit and he was, he was like shaking his head and he's like, I'm gonna fuck that dude up. He's like, he does not understand.

Speaker 1:          00:45          He's not on my level. He's talking to all kinds of shit. He's, you know, writing all these checks that there's no way he's fucking talent can cache. And when I get them in there, I'm going to smash him and he goes, I'm going to take my time on him. I'm gonna try to hurt him. He, this is what he said to me. That was crazy. He goes, I have never tried to hit anyone with all my power in the octagon. And I'm like, wait, what? That's not possible. He sends people flying across the aisle and watch his fight with Jay Huron. Oh yeah you can, you can hit somebody harder than that. Are you sure? Cause that's, that doesn't seem normal. That doesn't seem right. Talking about his leg kicks. I was just going to ask you, what'd you think of being there for the Gates Alvarez? That was great.

Speaker 1:          01:25          Gosh it was amazing. There was two fights that night that made, there was, there were humbling. Um, that was one of them. That fight was humbling like the fucking guts and glory. Watching those guys go at it. But Yancey Madeiros and cal by Oliveira might've been even crazier. I think that was the craziest fight of the night. I believe that one performance of the night. Thank the baby Jesus. Cause if it didn't, there was some criminal shenanigans afoot. It was the craziest fight ever. They one would get rocked and the other would get rocked and you'd think the fight was over. And then the other one come back, a rock, the other one. And then finally Yancey one and the third round. I mean it was just a fucking k odic war. It was such a good fight. Just such a good fight to bonuses to fight of the night awards. That's nice. See, that's what I love about the UFC when, when people really perform and lay it on the line like that. But did Allah did Haldo uh, although in Holloway, when any sort of a fight of the night, I know Francis didn't, but they said they were, yeah, they were going to hook him up with some sort of a bonus. How do you not give that Guy Kao the night? What? What are we doing here? What is it?

Speaker 1:          02:39          What's that say? It just says that those two guys fight at night. Didn't say anything about anything else. Oh, okay. Well. So does it says that fight, that fight of the night? No, no, no, no, no. The Gate, she g and Cowboy Oliveira Yancey Madeiros got fight of the night. Well Max Holloway's performance was nothing short of masterful, nothing short of Masto. The way he handled Aldo, the way he, he, he yelled at me after the first round, he gets done with the f, the round that he runs, he's going back to his and he looks at me, goes, the man is tired, the man is tired. He's a motherfucker, dude. Max Holloway is a real fucking warrior. I mean to the core, that guy relishes it. He loves it. When he was like, like chicken neck in it all though he's got his hands down. He's talking shit to them and stalking him.

Speaker 1:          03:27          You could see it in all those face. Like he was drowning. He would see the waves were coming and he knew he wasn't going to be able to dog paddle for too long. Like he's like Jesus Christ. Like how am I going to keep up with this guy? And the thing about Max Holloway that's so interesting is he's in a lot of ways, he has that sort of Nick Diaz approach where he's not hitting you with all of his mind. He's not throwing these haymakers and less, he's got you hurt until he's got you hurt. Once he's got you hurt, then he's just fucking whip and bombs your way. But until then he's just constantly on you just constantly peppering you, constantly, your kick knee punch, move forward, move forward, and you're just dealing with him and trying to breathe. You don't get any breath. And he just keeps that pressure on you.

Speaker 1:          04:10          And he knew all those fading, right? And I'll tell you all to look good. And at first I thought he's going to start picking it up. Like almost the old with the leg kicks, he should get clay kick, clay should have, he should have gone. His strategy should have been almost entirely leg kicks centered. Right? And he was trying to catch him and he caught him with a couple of good punches. But all of his punches are sprints, right? And if he doesn't knock you out with those sprints, like he only has so many of those in the gas tank, you're fighting the guy that can do it for a marathon and he and he can and Max Holloway, Ken, he is so well conditioned and so aware of visibility and not stretching himself. So when they got to the third he started slugging it out with all though at the very beginning of the third he's like, I know this guy's tired.

Speaker 1:          04:51          He goes, I'm going to make them sprint with me. And you could see like as the, the beginning of the third round played out, all was swinging wild at and I was watching it. So I was a, I was going like this is not conservative. Like he's not conserving his energy at all. What he's doing is trying to take Max Holloway out with one shot and he's blowing out his entire wad doing this. And then you saw Holloway just calming out, common on common on just bang, Bang, Bang, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop and all of those trying to move his head and he's using all his head movement. But he never gets a break. Yeah. It's an incredible pace that Holloway. That's incredible. It doesn't give you any space. You don't get any rest. You don't get it. He does. There's no laying back with Holloway.

Speaker 1:          05:35          Max Holloway's on you, on you, on you. I love what he said about fighting Aldo in Rio too. He goes, that's what kings do. He goes, they go to the other person's village and they'd take the crown. It's like, Ooh, it's right. It's what they do. That's what he did. He's the baddest motherfucker. I think he's the best one 45 forever. I mean, he might not agree with it yet because of the record, which I see. I see his point, but the way he fights the, the octagon Iq that he shows his, his fight Iq is ability to find a weakness and to see it as predatory behavior inside the octagon. I think he's the best. I really do. I just think I, I, it's so impressive to me that he's not like all doe in his prime was spectacular and amazingly impressive. Like his flying knee, first round knockout of Cub Swanson. The knockout of Chad Mendez, you know, I mean, he's, he's the, the Uriah Faber fight. We brutalize your rise leg. I mean, he's unquestionably one of the greats of all time, but in my opinion, skill wise, Max Hallway has now surpassed him.
