Speaker 1:          00:00          And I'm 100% confident. I did nothing wrong. Right. From a huge, as a human being or a comic, you know, like maybe reading the room would have been a thing I did, but I was like, I was like, I know these people. These are my fucking brethren. Like I, yeah, I got fucking took calculus with you people. You're like, yeah, I know. I know the kind of Shit that me and my Asian friends and my Indian friends would talk when we were in fucking school like this. This is fucking light work. Right. Right. And so, so maybe that, but even then I'm like, no, fuck that. I'm not going to fucking think about that going awry. You know what I mean? But yeah, it was, it was crazy. Yeah. Well it's, it's an educational experience and net positive overall without a doubt. And it also gives us an opportunity to make fun of these kids, which I think they need.

Speaker 1:          00:49          They need to realize that the world thinks they're fools. Yeah. And I, and I really believe that all, I've read several articles on your case, your situation rather your case caught a case. I got comedy me today. You know, all the articles that I've read were all essentially positive. Yeah. And they were all, you know, mocking these fucking little children. I want to say for the record that I was on the record, I still think that it was at the still think that though. It's like the minority of that group, especially at Columbia for sure. Sure. You know, like it's just that they happen to like, cause the majority of those kids were like amped and like had a good time. And even if that can happen though word, some majority a majority can like you in a minority can stand up and then the majority doesn't do anything about it.

Speaker 1:          01:36          You just go, wow, that shit hurt my feelings. No, no, no. Those kids, those kids saying like let them stay, let them stay. But it wasn't like a chorus, which is what I would have hoped. But um, yeah, they're a little fucking babies and they need to hear it. They need to hit it. The little babies, cause that's how you grow up. You know, you, you'd do something ridiculous and then people criticize you and then you realize, oh, I'm kind of ridiculous. Yeah, let me just check myself. Then it hurts your feelings and you fight it off for a little bit. You try to pretend you battle it, but overall over the course of time you're going to absorb that information and hopefully those kids are going to grow and mature. Yeah. I mean I have friends that were like completely progressive, Weirdo, crazy off the charts like activists 10 years ago and now they're like way, way mellow and they've just like, what was wrong with me?

Speaker 1:          02:28          I was virtue signaling I was trying too hard and they realize like the lot of what they were doing was just wasting energy and it was just, it just a lot of adjuncts in a lot of just trying to, trying to affect change in order to make themselves feel better. Yeah. You know what I mean? Trying to push buttons in order to validate their existence. That's what a lot of that, that that specific instant felt like it was like it was either like a, nope, we have an opportunity to assert our sort of rightness, however wrong it is here and be like, this is, we're going to take a stand and yeah, this is who we are. I'm like, y'all just just chill. Yo, chill the fuck out. What the fuck? Yeah. It's, there's a lot of foolishness, but this is the world we live in and I think there's a big part of that accentuated by the fact that we have a maniac for president.

Speaker 1:          03:16          Yo. Yeah. That's what it is. Because they feel like that eval needs to be combated at every turn because we didn't before and we let this guy get into office and now here he is, and the Mueller probe and all this fucking craziness. When Obama was president, it shit felt a lot cooler. Yeah. I mean now it's like Trump is present. Everyone was like, Oh shit man, bunker down. What'd you know? We realize all you have to do is be popular and you can be president. Like that's insane. Yeah. I used to be, you had to be qualified. We used to think that you understood national policy, foreign policy, you understood defense. You understood exactly what's going on with the economy. Basic English. Yeah. Yeah. That guy doesn't know shit. He's just trying to make money. And wouldn't you love to be a fly on the wall?

Speaker 1:          04:02          I would. Cause what we're getting, all the crazy is him when he knows cameras are on them. Oh yeah. I would love to see what he's like alone. Like what is, I would love to see him like watch Fox News. I like to like sit in our cheeseburger. Just fucking cry. He's a crazy person. It's really weird, man. It's unnerving. And that's what I think. Like what a lot of what we're seeing on, especially with this particular thing is the thing where it's like you don't have control in any other facet of your life necessarily. So you're going to try to exert it in a way that you think is positive, when in fact you're doing the opposite of what you, you're, you're liberal sensibilities are. Yeah. I think it's also a trend and I think, um, that political correctness and it comes in waves and it existed.

Speaker 1:          04:52          It was pretty, pretty strong in the 80s, you know, like political correctness was a washing over people in the 80s and destroy rap and shit and it's coming back and it'll go away again. People get sick of it and it'd be ridiculous and people will rebel against political correctness center it. But I think overall the culture is trying to adjust. It's trying to self adjust. We're trying to, the, the actual culture, the as a whole is trying to eliminate racism and eliminate sexism and eliminate bias, which are good noble goals there. Good number goals, right? But along the way, as you have these polar extremes of people that are doing it wrong, poor execution, terrible execution and everyone understanding, and it's also strange to me, it's like what utopia are you trying to create by silencing stuff? Because just because you do that, just because you say, oh, you can't say racist shit doesn't mean it goes away.

Speaker 1:          05:46          Or you can't say sexy shit doesn't mean it's a, that's more like you're treating the symptom and not the disease. Right. But in their defense does talking about very specific platform, right. This is a stage. If you had actually said something actually racist then it would make sense that hey, we don't want anybody telling racist you 100% right. Yeah. So they but they wanted it to be racist. Yeah. That's the thing. It's like Yo just fucking take a minute, take a second to relax and once I get it, is that what utopia have you read about that's ever been real? Like every book we read in high school, College, brave new world, Lord of the flies [inaudible] or animal farm like the giver we read in fucking Middle School, that's all a utopia. But this fuck fucking killing babies and you know south all of it. It's all a fucking false utopia kind of situation.

Speaker 1:          06:37          There's, there is hate speech in the world on a percent. You know, you don't want it on your platform, but you've got to decide what is hate speech, when is it really hate speech? And when is it just ignorance. And sometimes the best way to combat bad speech is to let that speech play out and let good speech overwhelm it with logic and reason and a better argument. That's, that's really what freedom of speech is supposed to be all about. That we work all this out. As soon as you start censoring voices and telling people that you're not going to allow them to talk, boy, you, you, you start, you create this atmosphere where you can start to choose what you're going to allow through and when you're not going to allow through, and then you're gonna start censoring things that are far more subtle. You're going to start censoring things that, you know, they don't seem reasonable, but you've decided that it's already okay to sensor. So you've censored this person nagging a sense of the next worst thing, right? And you're going to go down the line until it's just people that disagree with you.
