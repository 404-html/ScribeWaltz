Speaker 1:          00:00          An absolute beast with free speech. I and, and I know the fucking line. It's a private company. It could do what they want. Freedom of speech is about the government and it's like, yeah, but are you okay with that? Are you okay with a faceless corporation? Uh, deciding what you can watch and see and hear and who can speak based on nothing but this arbitrary ideology that comes out of a building. Like, I don't like that. I want anyone to have the ability to speak about anything they want, no matter how repugnant it is. Like, like meet it with a lively debate. Well, here's the, here's a perfect example. Forget Alex Jones. Let's talk about what we talked about earlier. Laura Loomer versus Louis Farrakhan. You, where's your consistency? You've got to explain to me how that works. How does, how is it okay for the guy on Twitter to be calling Jewish people termites?

Speaker 1:          00:51          I mean that that is, that's something you exterminate. Yeah, this is Nazi Germany type. Yeah, exactly. How is that? Okay, that's okay with you. But then, I mean, how about look, it's, it's works that way on the left as well. Like how about that guy that just got kicked off of CNN? Cause he was talking about the Jewish posers against Palestine and that he's for Palestinian liberation and they were like, fuck you, you're done. Like this, this decision that, or the, the thought processes involved in decisions that they make is not based on rational thinking and objective reasoning. So arbitrary, uh, you just don't know. It's based on which way the culture swinging, you know, and the culture is, is swinging in a way that avoids any, any possible accusations of racism. If you think in, in any way she performed, you're going to be thought of as racist.

Speaker 1:          01:42          You avoid that because there's some people that say horrific shit about white people. Oh yeah, yeah. They don't get van literally calling for their death and, and yeah, they don't know that girl that got hired by New York Times and it was a massive uproar because she had so many anti white things on her Twitter. Oh yeah, yeah. The Asian girl. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, just all that ridiculous left wing woke nonsense. You're allowed to be completely racist against white people. Massive generalizations against white men in particular. Yeah, it is. It absolutely is discrimination. And it's absolutely what you're doing is you're being prejudiced, but you're being prejudiced with a stamp. Well, you've got to stamp of approval. Yeah. You're allowed to be. And I love the, the just rules that are made up that are ridiculous. It's like, ah, you're a racist. I can't be a racist.

Speaker 1:          02:33          I am this or that, or I can't be sexist. I can't be this. I mean, it's like who's making these fucking rules up. Exactly. And how come I am not privy to any of them? Of course I can. I can call on any of these roles. Did. The beautiful thing about that is that hypocrisy will eventually bite them in their ass. And people who are rational, who listened to the argument against it. And so you, you absolutely can be sexist against men. Yeah, absolutely. Ken, of course. And you are a lot of feminists are 100% against men. There's this feminist that I fall her fucking Twitter picture, the image of the big one. The banner one says trust. No Man. Great. Okay, well good fucking luck. Good luck and cutting out half the population. Don't trust them. How about trust is all women you're going to do.

Speaker 1:          03:16          That will be great. Congratulations. Cause you got about 15 to 20% cunts and that's, you're going to have to trust all of them. Yeah. Yeah. Good luck. You got 80, 80, 85, 90% may be good gals and you've, you got uh, your, your polluted. We'll get a polluted population. Just like men, population of men is a polluted population of women. If you, if you thought that you were going to get pure drinking water without dropping in those, uh, purification tablets, you're going to get charged some shit in there. Yeah. You're going to get, you're going to get sick. The, yeah, that I, there's no, um, there's no 100% on any of that. So when we saw the whole believe all women thing that happens during the cabin hearings and whatnot, I didn't do that bit the other night. Did A, uh, uh, now tell it to you off air.

Speaker 1:          04:02          Oh, okay. I'll tell you something off here. That's, it's, it's, it's crazy. Like the idea that anyone would say, believe all women is as mental is saying, believe no women. It's the same stupid thing because there's going to be assholes is going to be pieces of shit. I was saying on the show the other day, like no one really wants equality. No one equality isn't good. The, the fight for equality is where it's at and you never want to attain it because then you're not special anymore. If you're fighting for equality that you're always a victim, there's always a, an oppressor and you're fighting that once you're equal, you can be called a shithead. You could be called stupid. Everything else. You're just another face in the crowd with another stupid voice that probably shouldn't be heard. Uh, so no one ever really wants equality. No matter how much they're clamoring to get achieved, you're going to find some reason why it's not right. Why it's not valid. And you can still say that you're, you're being victimized by something that currency in it. Yeah. Yeah. There is. There's, there's definitely equity and being a victim and not being equal yet. Wait, but you're fighting. You can say things that other people can't sit. Right. We see all the ties. You can be completely prejudice. You can do a lot of things you could never do if you were another race.
