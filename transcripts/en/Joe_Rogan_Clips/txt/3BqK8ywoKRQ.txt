Speaker 1:          00:00          Oh Shit. Hey, we talked about, remember the last time we talked about Huawei and it hasn't gone away. No, it hasn't gotten away. Sees someone just got arrested yesterday. Two people, two people. Uh, so, uh, so backstory, fascinating. This is fascinating. This is, this is an area I could definitely disappear down to Chinese espionage, right? They go on forever. Once again, I say, you know, I talk about are there certain things that the current administration is doing that I like? One of them is the way that they're dealing with China right now. And yes, the trade issue is buffeting the market somewhat and causing some instability. But again, previous administration, the Bush administration clinician, lots of, lots of prep for former presidents. They all acknowledged that China pub privately was not a fair trading partner. This administration's at least trying to call them out and calling them out on the, on the, on the cyber issue too, uh, on their, on their theft of intellectual property.

Speaker 1:          00:54          So anyway, Huawei, um, supposedly owned by the founder and however many employees, you know, I think Huawei is, by the way, uh, the number one telecommunications equipment manufacturer in the world, and they're the number two seller of smartphones right there. There are bigger seller of smartphones and apple. So at Samsung, Huawei, apple, uh, for this. And so supposedly the company's owned by the founder and his daughter is the chief operating officer, chief financial officer, one of those. She was arrested up in Canada, um, and she was arrested at the request of the u s she's up there on bail right now, waiting extradition, hearing. And the reason was because supposedly she lied about Huawei's dealings with Iran and they were busting sanctions by dealing in providing certain types of equipment to Iran. Now, uh, this, this, this past week, we've had, uh, a hallway employee who's now been fired by hallway, uh, in Poland, uh, arrested for espionage.

Speaker 1:          01:59          And along with him is a member of the Polish intelligence service, right. Who, uh, retired now and was now working for a French telecommunications company, but was arrested also for a espionage related to a, uh, and related to this individual who up until just recently, it was working for Wallet Wowway Claims Innocence and says, well, we have no idea. And the founder just came out and gave this big speech and said, I would never let the Chinese authorities tell me what to do. And I would certainly never spy on anybody using quallies capabilities and technology. And people are probably thinking, what the fuck are you talking about this for? A Huawei and beds, their telecommunications equipment throughout the world. Right. So it's in, uh, uh, our allies, uh, military operations, which then are connected to ours, right. In terms of communications and transfer of intelligence and information. Um, they're everywhere and it's a chose Poland.

Speaker 1:          02:56          They've been in Poland for about 10 years. Poland is a very important NATO ally. So I, I'm, I'm taking a long time, I realized to explain this, but what I'm trying to say is nothing happens by happenstance, right? The Chinese don't operate that way. So the Chinese authorities sometime ago, years ago, looked at it and went, yeah, this makes sense, right? We've got Huawei, which by the way, the founder of a former military, uh, people's Liberation Army engineer, um, he, uh, they, they, they looked at this and they thought Poland, uh, that would be a good beach hit for us, right? Because there are a key element of NATO, so let's go to Poland. So they started a burrowing into Poland striking deals and you know, they're basically the most important foreign relationship now a corporation inside a Poland and they're fully embedded and they've had access to, uh, at this point to NATO communications.

Speaker 1:          03:49          And now the arrest of these two individuals. And people will still, despite this and despite their past, despite their, their, their theft of information from everybody from us steel to, uh, to Alcoa, to Lockheed Martin to dupont, all the times that they've been stealing information, people will still go wide. You know, I don't, I don't believe it. I don't, that doesn't make any sense. I don't see why the Chinese would act that way. And I don't see why we're being so harsh on them. You know, this tariff thing is a bad idea. My point being, you got to call them out. They're not going to necessarily change their behavior, but you got to raise public awareness, make, uh, our allies understanding where that's what we're doing right now. We're saying you've gotta you got to put the brakes on this, build a firewall, use other companies, telecommunications equipment, right?

Speaker 1:          04:33          Because you know, the fact that we're tied in with our allies, with Poland and with Canada and know that gives them access to us. So for someone on the outside, look, myself was trying to look at this, and you, you say that Walway's stealing stuff like stealing stuff from us steel. How are they doing that? Well, they, I mean the u s steel, admittedly that was a, that was a pla, that was the People's Liberation Army, a third department operation against dupont and, and also against us steel and others. So that was a little bit different. I, I conflated the two, but Huawei, one of the things that they do is by having access, uh, and, and embedding their equipment in your communications, um, infrastructure that gives them the ability then to, uh, in, in a simple way to tap in. Right? And it's a package intercept information, right?

Speaker 1:          05:20          Basically. So you have communications, imagine we're trading information through NATO, uh, channels, right? All they need is that one in, right? That's it. It's like everything else, it's like fishing, right? It's just like, you know, when, when hackers just an individual hacker sitting in somebody's basement, you know, he just needs that one avenue. He needs to get one. It's just, just click on that email that gives me the pathway in. So when, when Huawei is able to embed their technology into Polish communications, and we're now connected because of our NATO alliance, that gives them access to us, to France, whomever, and yeah. You know, it's, it's not as if it just happened. It's not as if Huawei from a business perspective, so, you know, I bet we could sell some of our equipment in Poland. Wouldn't that be good? The guy who was arrested, the Huawei person who was arrested was responsible for the provision of telecommunication equipment to government facilities.

Speaker 1:          06:15          That was his job. And the guy, the Polish guy, one of his last jobs with the Intel service was, uh, communications. Uh, so I guess what I'm saying is none of this shit happens in a bubble and it's all, it's all very well mapped out. The Chinese have a very long view on things and they are very good at developing operations like this and so they've been very successful. Um, so we'll, we'll, we'll see. But it's, it's, I'm glad that the current administration at least is calling them out. I don't believe it's necessarily going to change their behavior and that, you know, and we'll, we'll probably get some sort of deal where they'll claim to look just a couple of years ago, they agree with President Obama to stop their cyber shenanigans and they didn't. So they just changed the way that they did it. Um, you know, that's, that's the world we live in, but I think it is important to make a stand, right?

Speaker 2:          07:05          Yeah. There's some that the tech people are saying that they think it's preposterous. When they were talking about the ban on android phones, some of the tech people say that doesn't make any sense, but what you're saying is it goes far beyond the actual phones itself. And it's really the, the mission of the actual company itself.

Speaker 1:          07:24          Yeah. I'm saying that there is no way that Huawei and, and other important Chinese companies are solely privately owned and, or have, uh, the ability to tell the Chinese authorities that they will not spy on their behalf. It just not happening. It's just not happening. You have to, you have to go a long ways to come up with that sort of naive viewpoint that says that a Chinese company is going to put its foot down until President Gee, absolutely not. We will not do anything to harm another nation's country or a company or shit they've spent, they've spent generations now decades, uh, jumpstarting their industry and moving up the food chain on the global economy by hoovering up everything possible out there. So if someone,

Speaker 2:          08:15          a tech wizard got ahold of one of their routers, can have they been able to detect something in there that doesn't belong or some sort of a back door or some sort of a way that they could tap in. It's like if you were, you know, you were apple and you were sending data to Raytheon or whatever and you're going back and forth, they could tap in through that as it had been proven that there's a device like that. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:39          A former NSA director Mcconnell back in, uh, 2015, I think early 2015, um, came out and NSA came out with an official statement and it said every major US corporation of any has been, um, uh, attacked and exploited by Chinese. And we have never, ever not found Chinese malware within their systems. Wow. That was over four years going out for malware being software. Right, right, right. Is there anything in the hardware itself? Uh, yes. In, in, in a sense that, um, yes, in, in the sense of like, I'm trying to remember the, the name of it, but not doing a very good job. Um, if you have, uh, access to or understanding of physical hardware, um, then you can, uh, affect easier, you can affect, um, physical control of systems. Right. So, uh, stuxnet, remember, I don't know if you remember stuxnet was a dude, but it was exactly, it was an attack on Iran.

Speaker 1:          09:51          Um, the shut down their nuclear program. Right, exactly. To, uh, essentially what it did was it took over control of some centrifuges, uh, over spun them that he did about broke. And it was a virus and it was, it was an piece of software that was able to impact the, the, you know, physical equipment. Uh, it took control of those systems because in part, uh, whoever perpetrated it had much better understanding of that gear. Right. Or had access to that gear. And that's a, that's an important part of, of this. And it's happened several times since then. And I'm, you know, I'm not disclosing anything because it's all it's been written about. I'm sure it will be a movie at some point, but, um, that is, uh, that's a concern. I'm far more worried about a company like Huawei with, it's a integration into allied, um, our allies, uh, telecommunications systems than I am about sort of the individual sale of phones. And you know what that means? Look, you know, Amazon and all the others are gathering more data on the average American than, you know, uh, US government or anybody else's government is doing it at this point.
