Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. You know, as I was thinking about, um, what the, so with John being out and then you got calmer, right? Like Connor, neat things like looming in the air. That's like what they gotta do next. He's huge money fights. Other than that, there's not a huge money fight. But Connor has changed the game for the better, especially with a fighter. But it's like, you know with WME he's steering the ship. Yes. Like think, think about it. Cause he made over, cause the numbers coming out, their stance going to be his paper of all time. So he made a hundred something million dollars, right? Yeah. So you're telling me if you're kind and you're part of his team, he didn't go, hey fight Nate Diaz for how much? Five. 10 million. Oh and also we need your weird, this Reebok and they're gonna pay you $100,000 a year. Think College go.

Speaker 1:          00:46          You're fucking crazy. Well I'm sure there's non negotiables and one non negotiables. The Reebok deal, like you can't get around it, but what'd you can get disagree. Well, it seems like you can't get around it right now. Everybody's wearing Reebok clothes. Well, no, you can get this. I'm not saying he's not not going to wear Reebok, but what you have to do it you're, you're playing a different game now. You're talking about the biggest athlete combat sports and you're not getting him for the 200,000 you were paying a year. Oh yeah. That's so that he can go, listen, I'm down to wear Reebok, but it's a different animal now. Well, Reebok professionally sponsors him to site. They do Paige vanzant just like they did Canada different and more money, more, but not to like think how much he made to just wear those, you know, whatever he had on his trunks.

Speaker 1:          01:33          Right. That's a good point. You know, that fight, if it really did get six and a half million paper view bys, like they were talking about Conor making $100 million. If it got 5 million paper, you've eyes, they got one and a half more than that. It's like he's super, that's, that's up for debate because you know how that came about. So I think Dana was sitting on on that suitcase or something and uh, your eyes filming, right. And Dana goes, he didn't think he was being recorded. And Dana goes 6.5 mil and everyone's like, damn, you know, in the room like, oh damn dog and Snoop's like damn dog. And then your eye turns on the and goes 6.5 million and it shuts the camera off. But Dana never officially said 6.5 but that's how it got started. So Espinosa from showtimes like uh, it's going to break the biggest point of view numbers all the time.

Speaker 1:          02:23          But we're thinking more around four something. Oh, like almost five. Yeah. So who's, who knows the truth and who doesn't? I don't know. I liked to go with Dana on this one. I'm sorry. Me. Yeah, I was crunk I blasted out right now online it says trending towards 4.6 million. Oh cool. Domestic, domestic. Oh well then it's 6.5. So this is my thing with Dana. He wouldn't just throw that up cause he doesn't wanna look like an idiot. Especially with he did official or not. If he says that to you, Ryan, snoop, he didn't think he was being recorded but Dana wasn't just like 6.5 everybody like she's not making that up. If it's trending towards 4.6 nationwide and America, that's 100% 2 million more overseas guarantee you that our calls us says that uh, it wasn't $100 worldwide either. It was 25 bucks in some countries, 24 99 or in the UK and Ireland.

Speaker 1:          03:17          You know that's interesting. But still you, you still the pay per view buys it. It's going to be around 6.5 from while I heard it's going to be six one five seven does, does the UK have like a history of paper views like we do? Yeah. Joshua quite the same. That was, that was a pay per view for them over there. But over here was it's free. Free. It was HBO. Right. Cause he's not big as star that you know, we like trade a little bit. Yeah. Yeah, it makes sense. Yeah. It doesn't make sense. I just wonder how many people order paper. I mean, you know, the whole, the way they watch TV is different there. And I don't think they consume as much TV as we do with flatting. If Connor Suetand or anything Josh was fighting. They do. Yeah. But I mean like overall England, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think they have as many channels as we do.

Speaker 1:          04:02          I don't think they watch as much TV as we did this 2017 so yeah, by Netflix they get all that. That's not what I'm saying. I just don't think that it's a normal part of their day, the way it is our day. I don't think people in England like, well go BBC to find, but I don't think they watch as much. Yeah. I don't think they watch as much TV on a whole as we do. They have some great shows. No, no doubt. But I don't think they watch as much TV on a whole. I think that's more of a like a, it's probably fair to say a problem with our lazy ass. Yeah, it's a big problem. I watch some TV there last, I'll work out for guts to their own president. Works, works out at all. Zero watches, five hours of TV a day.

Speaker 1:          04:40          He's hilarious. He doesn't believe in bed. He thinks your body's a battery. You think Juliet. So He's, do you choose? You only have so many beats. That's why he looks like he's hilarious. He's so fat. I was definitely an unhealthy looking. This fight to amazing by the way, for you paying attention at all. Zero. Um, yeah. But either way, I think it's going to break the paper, your numbers. So, but congress changes the dynamics for everyone. Cause now when you want him to fight again, you can't have them agree to those old terms. He's a smart guy. And if he learned anything from Floyd, you know, when you, when you fight Floyd, you're fighting a different animal.
