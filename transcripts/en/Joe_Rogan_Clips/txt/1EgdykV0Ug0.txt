Speaker 1:          00:00          When it comes to meat. Um, do you guys prefer a grass fed beef or do you like, uh, corn fed? Because I had this discussion with Tony and he was telling me that he actually liked corn fed beef. He's like, it's a fattier. There's, there's two schools of thought and then there's two schools of what is quality beef, right? So one school will say, yeah, quality beef is organic animal pasture raised eating grass. The flavor is different. It's not as tender, but it is high quality beef. Okay. Then the other of course is, you know, a cow, USDA prime cracked corn fed, incredible marbling, ridiculous fat content, restricted motion. Uh, I'd say a lesser quality beef. Okay. Then then the other, but they all start eating wise. All pastored at first eating wise,

Speaker 1:          01:07          you know, grandma pat pound for pound, the corn fed steak will be more delicious. Okay. For some people. And then for some people the other one will be, and my, my mind, the grass fed organic pasture beef with it's different flavor for me as a higher quality animal. I, I prefer that taste correct. I feel it's a Richard taste. It's a denser, darker meat. Iron taste. Yeah. I just like it better. And I do like a corn fed steak. I do like and the general public, the steak eating public that come to restaurants and counter more corn fed beef that and they, their first judge of character to the quality of that meat is tendering. It's tenderness. It's marble. It's not tender. It's not tender. That's the reoccurring thing that we fight with every day job. While they're juicy and tender to see to a 16 ounce fog walk tender.

Speaker 1:          02:13          I know. I mean, what are they looking for? Can teeth work but we get to take sends back. It'll be because yeah, it's tough. Yeah. Oh. Dot. Exactly. It's not advice. You usually go to this steak house and it's two more tender because you're bringing your serving of grassroots. Sorry, I grass fed or grass fed steak. Uh, that's not as marbled as it's not organic. Well, it's an, it's an oral that healthy, but you can also have set up great valley. It's like, it's like the natural wine versus conventional wine fight. Right. That we're having, you know? Yeah. But it's also, we're calling it binary now. It's like it's only corn or it's only grass. No, I think the solution is maybe a little bit of a corn, a little bit of barley, but mostly grass fed, you know, a brief finish and like quality grains, why not?

Speaker 1:          02:58          And then there's a whole other point, like, I'd like to raise giant feedlots. I like to sell beef, uh, in my restaurant that comes from very close to my restaurant. You know, when we opened Joe beef at the beginning, when that first book, the first book was written, uh, beef was a problem back then. You know, local beef was kind of difficult. And you know, we were buying beef from larger wholesalers and we, if we didn't know how to read the barcodes on the boxes, they would say it was Canadian beef. But it might not beef, it might be north northern USA beef. But we didn't know because only a professional could read the Barcode. But they were saying it was Canadian. But one day I had a professional come into the restaurant and he said, no, actually this beef is, yeah, from a company with investiture is in Canada, but this is from Western Australia.

Speaker 1:          03:51          And I say, I don't want to serve anything in my restaurant from Western Australia. That's super far. Like I'd like, you know, this is like remove beef from the menu or seek alternatives. Uh, but it's a business that's complex because there's pastures and feed lots slaughterhouse and packers. Right. And, and it's not like a, you, we have lambs, got a baby lamb that come from the parents lamb and then they farm, they raised the lamb and they bring it to the slaughter house themselves. And then we get a lamb. Beef is like you can get, it's like tracing bourbons, you know, it's like trading and brokerage and stuff and we're not, it's the most sketchy item on a restaurant menu. Like I know that I bought land from you and I know I bought rabbit from, you know, Beatrice and I know I got go cheese from this family and all of the products in my restaurant.

Speaker 1:          04:46          I know exactly the farm and the farmer beef is always dicey because beef always goes to the packer. Beef always goes to the distributor but fought, you know, to, and the general public only really eats two cuts of beef in restaurants, you know, three cuts, the tenderloin that the, what do you call it, an English, then I'll put a coat, you know, the loans. The loans, right. That's what people leave the hamburgers beefs or not that, you know, there's two big humps and there's two big shoulders and there's a lot of brays. So, you know, it's a, it's difficult. This is, we see that a documentary on steak. Yeah. We're in it. We were in, it's right. Yeah. You were in it. What did you think of that and then their conclusions and what was the conclusion? Well, just basically we're saying to Peter Luger steak house in Brooklyn is a greater stake in the world.

Speaker 1:          05:41          Da Prime Corn Fed for taste. Maybe. It's good. It's good restaurant. Good. Good story. Good history. Great restaurant. I ate there just a few months ago. It was very good. Yeah. Very good. Yeah. But, um, but again, it's a subjective thing, right? The flavor in terms of like what you actually look for and they as they were talking about like your customers saying they're accustomed to a certain type of meat. Like they were saying that their customers are accustomed to this. They're not interested in grasp at anything. But I understand that, you know, they've been doing that for a long time and you're hitting that beef that way and I don't think they should change ever. Not based on anything. Right. Well, it's a great place. We get consistency. I mean, you go there, you get this fantastic steak. It's, I mean it's so old world. He too and you get in there that, I mean, how long has, Peter Luger has been around for cod forever. Forever. Yeah. It's 120 years or something. Something insane like that. And they get the moisturizers like that. In my trial, I was very old steak restaurant. Moisture's is a famous restaurant in Montreal and they, you know, they do have their beef program and they should not change because there's new conversations happening. He knows what he's doing. Lenny lighter and he should do, you know, keep on doing that.
