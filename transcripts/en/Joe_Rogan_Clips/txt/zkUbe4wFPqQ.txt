Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience but never got injured. Even if he did, he wouldn't know. What does that guy doing these days? I have no clue. I know he wrote a book. It was the last time we handle on the inside of way. Oh, you guys had them on? Yeah. I mean that's five years ago. That guy, my guy was a fucking character. I mean if it wasn't for guys like tank Abbott, I mean there would have been no early days. Yeah. You know you needed a guy looked at identify with him. A lot of these crazy guys out there. Shoe. You can do what? I can do this. Yeah, that's what you need. Yeah. I had a giant bell in. You would knock people dead. Yeah. He was like a Roy Nelson only with no stamina. Yeah. Well and and and no black belt tech. No black belt in Jiu Jitsu. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:45          Well Roy Nelson is a fucking complete anomaly. Yeah, he is. Looks like if you lose weight, how is it possible that he trains so hard? I've seen this guy throw world like 130 155 pound kettle bells, like one arm swings. We can wing being like, it's nothing. You would lose weight, right? You would think, but he would be a 185 pound phenom instead. He's a heavyweight. He's a cubic contender and maybe it's an implant in the belly that he just wants to do that because the Buddha belly implants kick them and he didn't even feel it. He's aware a chess pad. He imagined someone did that. I mean if girls get fake boobs, let's think about this cause girls do get fake boobs and they fight. You know girls have got it. I want to mention any names, but we seen it. Girls have had no boobs and all of a sudden they have boobs.

Speaker 1:          01:32          You can get fake boobs and still fight. But what about a fake belly? What about a guy who says, I just like, oh, I like a belly. I like looking good. You know, if, if a guy had a fake belly, I was going to try to see if we're going to hit it to the back. I'll say I'll make a hunchback out of them. See if you can move the battle all the way to the back. Way To hook to the back. Lower back. We never had one like that, you know, I mean the hunchback from not are dumb. That's a high, but no, you never saw a hundred beck from the bottom right. Like lower back. We can make that like a lumbar pad. Work as a lumberjack. Yeah. Sleeps all night. Then he works all day. Like if, if you look at Roy Nelson, he's like the size of a really good middleweight.

Speaker 1:          02:19          Yeah, no he is. Yeah. But meanwhile the guy knocked out, Chuck Congo knocked out Brendan Shab knocked out some big fucking heavyweights. Knocked out mitre own. I mean fucking knocked out a lot of people. Staples. Troover right. That'll show, did he knock out seven? I do not remember that fight. Wow. Um, and it does. The worst thing is it's with his right hand. So you were thinking that people going to the hill to left up, but somehow he connects anyway with the arm bars. You know what's going to happen? We can stop it. No, almost knocked down over him. Remember that? Yeah, he heard over him. Yup. True. Back home. Jesus Christ. Crazy. Yeah. I mean, Roy is like six feet tall. Stephan's true. Seven feet tall. Yeah. I mean fucking animal. Roy is an animal and I honestly, I mean look at his gut right there.

Speaker 1:          03:14          How much does that, he weighs about two 50. Right? He's, he, I'm not bullshitting. Yep. He is 50 pounds overweight and he's a world class athlete. I mean, you cannot say the Roy Nelson is not a world class fighter. He's absolutely a world class fighter and he's 50 pounds overweight. So you dropped down 50 pounds. Now you're 200 pounds, you make 85. You cut weight. Everybody does that. Cut 15 pounds. You're 85. You're a world champion. You know, there's not a butter bean. You know, we were somewhere, uh, and the letter commissioner taught me from all the boxes on the cart. He had actually the best blood pressure and cholesterol for, for real. He said we were a shock that the guy is in the phenomenal shape. That's what he told us. Yeah. That's insane. Butter being made him look like, yeah, you're Rodriguez. Look at him.

Speaker 1:          04:07          Jesus Christ. I actually, it looks good here is the whole family is going to look exactly like that. I hear go upper right hand corner. Yeah. That's what he looked like when he was at its worse. Meanwhile, he's another guy knocked dude's dead man. He is so funny. That's such a good time with him and [inaudible] Prince George in Canada. He was there. He's a player. Oh yeah. That's hilarious. Very funny guy. That's funny. You know he's a fucking hell of a cook. Apparently you can't tell, but it like there's was watched a video of butter being cooking some ribs and I was like, damn, that looks legit. Like a smoker. Who was cooking them in a smoker? He broke the rule though. Don't get high if you're on supply.

Speaker 2:          05:02          Okay.
