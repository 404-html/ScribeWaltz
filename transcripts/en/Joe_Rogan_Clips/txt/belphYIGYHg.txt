Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah. Wait, so you, cause you were telling me this and I was like, he was about to tell me before you came and I was like this sounds like this could be pretty good. Don't tell me save it for the podcast that cause he's done. This is the most press Sean's done for a film that he's put out that did you go under? They were like let's give you some advice on media. Yeah. Well first of all I'm terrible at it. There's that, cause I don't do, this is the thing, when you direct a movie, especially in movies like the kind of movies that I make comedies and you know big broad comedies, people don't really care who directed those movies. And I'm good with that. Like I'm totally good with that. But what usually happens is the studio, the director usually wants to be kind of a part of the campaign.

Speaker 1:          00:40          So the studio will find, they'll sort of throw bones at u of like press that you can do. And I always tell them, look, if I can be helpful in any way, let me know. I'll do whatever you need me to do, but don't throw many bones cause I don't care. Right. I don't need it to Kinda just pump up the ego of the director that certain directors just really want to be the next Quentin turn. Yeah, I can't, I can't imagine there's some directors they really have to do it for. I get it. They don't want you to feel left out or whatever. But by my first couple of movies I thought, oh I have to do this stuff. And then I realized, I actually had this experience where I was in this red carpet thing and they brought me up to this reporter and they said, this is Shawn Andrews.

Speaker 1:          01:16          He directed the movie and she had this big look on her face and then she went like, ugh, cheese. And I was like, Nah, it's cool. You don't have so disappointed. So disappointed. And that's when it sunk into me where I was just like, oh they don't care. They don't give it. So that's, that's fine with me. I'm good there. Well there's such fame whores and those days are those red carpet things. There are so weird. Yeah, those things are so weird. And some people that is the highlight of their life walking that carpet. I can't chew over here. Tom got your pose down. Right.

Speaker 1:          01:51          It's a really weird thing. Also the Paparazzi at the airport, you have that where, um, I've seen them where I'm at baggage and they're looking around and then they're like, hey Tom. And they'll ask me like more thing and they're like, they're obviously not there for me, but they're like, they're like, we got time till fucking whatever. Seth Rogan gets off the plane, so let me ask you something. And then they're like, oh, all right, nevermind. Here's everybody. Like, just blow you off. I happen only one time because this obviously doesn't happen to me. They was flying at lax and I was getting off a red eye and I was so just tired. I looked like shit and that, and this guy, these two guys come up and they just were so nice. They were like, hey, you're Sean Anders. Right? And I was like, yeah, yes I am John Anderson.

Speaker 1:          02:33          Nobody ever, you know? And so it takes me a second to realize, and I thought it was so weird because they were, it was right after, it was shortly after daddy's home. And that was like the biggest hit. And they were asking me about horrible bosses too. And I was like, why are they asking me about, of all things horror? And I thought, oh, because Jennifer Aniston's in it. So they want me to say something about Jennifer Aniston and just see if they can catch me saying something crazy and looking for a soundbite slip or something. There's all they tried to do. Yeah. It was the worst. It's weird. And my wife is like, what was that? I'm like, I, I, it took me like an hour to sort of like trying to make you click bait. It's not, yeah. Well, what's interesting too is it's like sort of an impromptu interview that you have to do, right?

Speaker 1:          03:14          Like if somebody said, hey, this guy's name is Mike. He lives in studio city. He wants you to go to his house and, uh, he's gonna film you. Uh, he's going to ask you wacky questions. He'd be like, no. Yeah, but if Mike shows up at the baggage claim and puts that camera in your face, hey, Sean, Jennifer Aniston, man, what's up with the Botox? You're like, what? Yeah. Fuck. You know what I mean? That's how they get, like, you wouldn't do an interview with them under any other circumstances, which is one of like, one of the weird things that happened during the Roseanne Barr things. Roseanne Barr, when her show was canceled and all the controversy was going on, she was supposed to do the podcast and it became a big news thing cause she put it on her, uh, her Twitter that I'm going to do it.

Speaker 1:          03:54          And we talked about it. And then they tried to show up at the podcast studio. So they had all these news people standing outside the podcast studio with their microphones were out at, out in front of where Joe Rogan does his podcast and they thought for some reason, just because they're there, people have to talk to them. Right. I'm here. Talk to me like they're made out of milk. They're barely human. They, the way they talk is the most boring version of an interview you'd ever get ever. It's a tiny, quick little soundbite, but they feel like, because they're, they're like, the camera's on. I've got the microphone. Come on it. You do it. If they said, hey, you know, kw, fuck yourself once you to come in and sit down for an interview, you'd be like, no, I don't want to. I don't want to talk to them.

Speaker 1:          04:40          I don't know. I don't have anything to say like, Oh, I'll do all my talking on the podcast. Yeah, well, but, and also if you're, I mean, I'm in the business, but again, I'm not somebody that does a tremendous amount of pressure, or at least not until a couple of weeks ago. And if you're not accustomed to that, it's terrifying. It's weird because somebody puts a camera in your face because immediately you're thinking like, well, if I just go, you know what man? Fuck you. Like, I don't have time for that. Then you're going to, so you just think like, I can't even walk away from this. So you're just feeling like you're all of a sudden somebody through a cage over you and they're not even asking you, can I do this? They're just doing it. They're just, hey Sean. Yeah. Let me ask you a question, Shawn.

Speaker 1:          05:16          It's forced. It's forced on you. It puts you in a weird spot. It's like all of a sudden you're in your, you're on, you're on your heels because you're instinct is to be defensive. If someone could see your, you know what I mean? Your instinct is not going to be, I'll give the most thoughtful answer to this because it's, it's, it's in the moment. Someone just dropped it on you. So now you're like, okay, and your, your emotions might be kind of all over the place and you're not, you're not stopping to like, like having a conversation. You're just sort of trying to figure your way out of it. And how many people have ruined their careers or lives on those things just said, just fucked up and said one, they just try to be funny or just that's the thing. Cause they'll misquote, dated and then they get ya.

Speaker 1:          05:59          And then they put it up and you're like, fuck, why didn't I think through that? I was coming home from the airport, I was tired. I was jetlagged Bordain got a shitload of death threats because he said they asked him if you had a serve dinner to Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, what would you serve? He said, hemlock, he's trying to be funny. Yeah. And then you all these Manga fucking morons protestors were there. They were all sending these tweets like Potus, you know, he's threatening POTUS and it was so strange. Like where, where's the NFL? You know, where's the secret service? They should lock this motherfucker up. And like you guys are crazy. It's a joke. And that's the thing right there is that clickbait articles are, they all make it, it'll say like so and so said this and they make it sound like somebody like called a press conference to say something ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          06:47          And really it was like, like you said, it'll be some offhand remark and then people out there that are judging they that they never have anybody walk up and put a camera in their face and they just think, well, I would never say anything like that. It's like you don't know what you would say. You're never in that situation. It's bizarre. It's very bizarre. Bizarre. So how many of these things did you have to do to promote this film? Because it will, because of this film was based in large part of it. On your actual life experiences of adopting these kids. How many of these things did you have to wind up doing a lot? Because I did, we did our press junket in New York and I've done junkets and usually I do like, you know, six or seven or 15 or whatever I did in two days.

Speaker 1:          07:29          I did like 90 95 sort of the same questions keep coming at you over and over again and you start developing these canned responses. That's the thing, you have to, and this is a mistake, and this gets back to what you were getting at before, is that when I would do press on my movies in the past, I go to the junket and people would come in and they didn't ask you more or less the same questions. And I always felt weird because I just felt like, no, I just want to have a conversation with you. I don't want to be like this disingenuous guy. And then I would be sort of changing up my answers and trying to kind of, and it just essentially just made it boring and I wasn't really making any kind of a point whatsoever. So, uh, on this one, they were like, look, you've got a message with this movie.

Speaker 1:          08:07          You've got things you want to get out with this movie. You've got to learn how to do this. So I went, I went to like a day of media training. And it was, I did, I did. And it was, the worst part was I had done interviews and I've been fine before. I got this guy sitting across from me. Uh, who's, who's interviewing me doing this mock interview, and then I've got the publicist and my writing partner and they're just staring at me and now all of a sudden I can't do it. Right. All the pressures there. Who's teaching you? Who is teaching this media training? Here's what they right away like, you kind of suck at this. Absolutely were. I mean, they were really nice about it. They were like, okay, all right, well there's some, there's some room for improvement. Oh my God. Really? Oh yeah. I know. It was the worst. It was, seemed like a natural, I mean there's what is there to teach. You well know what it was. This, this is the thing is I'm really comfortable with this with, with us just hanging out here talking. Sure. But this is what I do is I Yammer when I'm, I'm a nervous talker. So you asked me a question if I'm nervous, I just kind of go and go and go. And people are like, Geez, us, you know that guy talk.

Speaker 1:          09:17          So the thing is, I got this guy sitting across me, really nice guy and he's The guy who's coaching me, but I know I'm going to get some trolls, like fake interviews. Well he'd how they coach you first he gave me, he gave me a lot of really good insights and the funny thing is every rule that he's saying as he sang it, I'm going, Oh yeah, I do that. Oh yeah. Like everything he's saying that I shouldn't be doing. I'm like, Oh yeah, that's, I always do. What is he saying you shouldn't be doing? I mean that the main thing, it's kind of like what we were getting at before that when somebody is setting a trap for you, because so much of right now media training is just about don't go out and get yourself into trouble by going in and, and just talking about some ridiculous area that, cause that's what people, that's what everybody's trying to do now.

Speaker 1:          09:59          Like just as a, for example, I did a Time magazine interview about adoption about a year before we even made the movie. Really? Yeah. The, and it was just because I was in the process of working on the movie anyway, the whole thing was just about adoption and my family and whatever. And it was right when the Harvey Weinstein stuff was blowing up. So ladies, really nice interview. And then at the end she says, uh, hey, you know, since I'm talking to a Hollywood director, I'd be remiss if I didn't ask did you know about that Harvey Weinstein stuff? And I was like, Nah. And I mean it. And I didn't even think about my answer because I don't, you know, I didn't know the guy was never around any of it. That's sort of like more like fancy movies. And I was like, yeah, I know I don't, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          10:40          I never met the guy, whatever. I didn't think anything of it. And I got off the phone and then I thought, oh, she didn't say, what do you think about this stuff? She said, did you know about that stuff? And it was like, and then I knew, but I kept it a secret. Yeah. Those people. And I just thought right away, I just, you know, so yeah. It's, it's, it's sneaky. That's a sneaky way of asking. It's a sneaky, the way to get you to yeah, yeah, yeah. Did you know, well if you don't enter his captors Weinstein secret for years, I, I'm such a dumb shit. I would have, like you said before, I think, I think a year or two ago I might of made a joke, you know, and been like, oh yeah, I was there, you know, just printing. Yeah. Anders was there.

Speaker 1:          11:24          And then if you like what you know, so, uh, so you know, a lot of it is just just to kind of teach you how to just sort of stay on point so that you don't get dragged down these weird roads into these things that just, that people are looking to get you in on clickbait. So did you bring up that instance when you went through the training? Oh yeah. Did you say what should I have said? I think I did. I think and really what they, what they teach you. It was funny cause believe it or not, he said I'm going to show you some clips of, you know, sort of doing it right and doing it wrong. Oh they have disaster clips. They say they do. And one of them, the file that you sent to jail, the show, and you guys will probably all know this one.

Speaker 1:          12:01          They showed me a clip of Quentin Tarantino, sort of like getting really angry with this reporter. Does that the violent thing? Yeah. I thought it was kind of and kick some guys asked that lady was like, your films are disgusting and violent. And he was like, yeah, they're fucking movies dummy. Like he gets really upset about it. And where was this? Actually I don't know if it's the same one. Cause the one that I saw was a guy. Oh I saw him with a lady. Uh, but that was via sat like a, okay. So this is a different one. Then there was one where the guy's threatening to kick the guy's ass. I don't, the one that I saw didn't go that far. But what I actually Kinda liked what he did cause he was like, no, I'm not playing that game with you. I'm not doing, he got all pissed off but I was sort of like, Eh, you know, I liked that he does that.

Speaker 1:          12:44          I mean I liked the one with the lady. The lady is like, your movies are so violent. Awful. And he was like a movie, a make belief thing. It's not real violence. Like he really Sassy as her. It's funny as shit. And then I also, so she, where was she? She was doing, you know, she was, she was like good morning Pittsburgh, like the entertainment reporter. And then he was actually probably doing like satellite stuff everywhere and he was just like, you're dumb. So, uh, but I also saw there's that guy, he's a Gotcha guy too. Did a Robert Downey jr it was like promoting a movie too. I don't know if they should go that one. Right. And the guy's like, yeah, now your drug addiction. He was like, wait, what? Like it was totally to try to get him to, you know, in a moment, Robert Downey jr is not having it.

Speaker 1:          13:28          He's like, Nah, I'm here to promote a movie. Yeah. This has nothing to do with that. Totally. Is that what he said? But let's, let's get into your drug addiction. Yeah. He was like, during your darkest times, like what are you talking about man, iron mans out. I'm not doing my hair for that. Well, it's just like the ends it too. They're so selfish. Like that thing is so doing shit like that is so selfish. It's such a sneaky little thing to do. They know. What did they teach you though? Like in that moment of like Quintin, they're just like, don't, don't get emotional. Well, it's like don't take the bait and, and more than anything for me, because I look, I'm from Wisconsin and I still have that kind of, everybody's nice, everybody has good intentions, kind of five, you know. So, and I had this experience on my very first movie where I talked to this reporter because it was a movie about a, it was a road trip.

Speaker 1:          14:16          You know, it's just a silly road trip comedy, you know, and I talked to this reporter and he says, and he, and he was just being, he was being really cool. We were just kinda hanging out after this thing talking and he's like, sa and gas prices were really high. And he goes, so yeah. You know, he's, he's like, you feel worried about making a road trip movie when gas prices are so high? And I, and I said like, ah, I don't know. I, I, you know, maybe if the movie tanks I can just blame it on that no one could afford to go to the theater because the prices were so high and I don't think, and then this article comes out that just, the guy literally said I was swarthy looking and it just, he just painted me like an absolute piece of shit and I was like, that guy was so cool.

Speaker 1:          14:52          Like he was like when we were having a nice time talking and then he just destroyed me. I've been there. Yeah, I'm sure you guys have. Yeah, that's all new to me. I remember one too that like who did it to me, like when I was just doing phone, like a phone interview for press before I was selling any tickets and the guy was like, just like a really nice guy and totally twisted things and made it seem like just like he knows what I was saying and he purposely twisted things around and then it had real no, no impact. But I remember reading that and being like, Oh fuck this guy and, and be careful when you talk to these people because he totally, he knows what I was trying to say and I, and I read this article, I was like, he misrepresented everything.

Speaker 1:          15:36          Yeah. Well that's the only way they can have fun. Yeah. And that's the only, I mean if you're just a normal guy and you give a, you know, normal answers and you're thoughtful and considerate, that's not as good for them. Right. It's boring to them. Twist it around. Well, it's not just, it's not as profitable. Right. It's more profitable. Especially if it's an online thing with an online thing. You need a clickbait title. You need a bunch of people clicking on that thing because otherwise you're not going to get any ad revenue for it. Yes. It's a very bizarre model where it's like encouraging people to be deceptive and to make these things inflammatory. And I got to say, I mean, look, I did, like I said, I did nineties 95 interviews and suck in the course of two days and virtually everybody was really cool, really asking, really thoughtful, interesting question.

Speaker 1:          16:21          So I don't want to make it sound like I'm ripping on the whole press over this. But yeah, there are these people and that's the thing is that if it was every single person that came along, it would almost be easier because you could just kind of be like, okay, here we go. I got it. Right. But you, but you get like 30 really good, you know, uh, reporters with integrity and good people and then somebody jumps in and you're like, oh yeah. And then, then, then they catch you not looking because you're not looking for that guy. It also gets super jaded, you know? It's almost like cops that have arrested too many people. Everyone's a crook. Like they just think that everybody that we're interviewing is a piece of shit. And it's also like they're interviewing these Hollywood people. They're thinking of you.

Speaker 1:          16:58          You had a big mansion and driving a Mercedes. You got all this money. Fuck this guy. It's like this instant take on it. Oh, a Hollywood director. Right, right. How's your casting couch? Yeah. Shit. Yeah, that's true. It's true. And it becomes the game. I think too for them the game is like, let's see if I can get one and we shouldn't be real clear. This is not, most people, most people are nice, but it's just like one, even if it's only one out of 10 you run into that one. You're like, fuck these things. I don't want to do these things anymore. Totally terrifying because you think about your family, your friends, like anybody who's going to cause now there, there is this, and I know you guys talk about this a lot. There is this culture out there where people are completely reduced to like one moment or one statement or whatever it is.

Speaker 1:          17:43          And that's all you are, is that whatever that thing that happened in that one moment and you know, you see it happening to people all the time and you think about so, so when you're there and you feel like you're just a regular guy, you don't feel like you know that. It's really scary because you think about your kids and you think of it, you know, it's so, it's a, it's a scary situation. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's a weird time for these publications to them and it's done. Nothing taken in consideration. No one's really buying magazines and newspapers like they used to. It's hard to sell. And so they're reduced to these online publications and they have to compete with a bunch of these click baity bullshit things. And that's where the money is. I mean, even in New York Times, man, the New York Times is resulting to a lot of click baity shit now.

Speaker 1:          18:29          And you're like, wow. Well do you guys have that feeling like when you're online that you're on like a clickbait diet where you see things where you're like, oh man, I totally want to eat that right now, but like I'm not, I'm not going to do that. Let me get an ingredient. Yeah, open it up. Oh, it's so sweet that you click on it, you're like, navigate it. Now you read that title and you're like, I know this will have no substance to like one moment or one statement or whatever it is. And that's all you are is that whatever that thing that happened in that one moment. And you know, you see it happening to people all the time and you think about so, so when you're there and you feel like you're just a regular guy, you don't feel like you know that.

Speaker 1:          19:10          It's really scary because you think about your kids and you think of it, you know, it's so, it's a, it's a scary situation. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's a weird time for these publications to them and it's taken in consideration. No one's really buying magazines and newspapers like they used to. It's hard to sell. And so they're reduced to these online publications and they have to compete with a bunch of these click baity bullshit things, and that's where the money is. I mean, even in New York Times, man, the New York Times is a resulting to a lot of click baity shit now. And you're like, wow. Well do you guys have that feeling like when you're online that you're on like a clickbait diet where you see things where you're like, oh man, I totally want to eat that right now, but like, I'm not, I'm not going to do that. Let me get an ingredient. Yeah, open it up. Oh, it's so sweet. You Click on it, you're like, navigate it. Now you read that title and you're like, I know this will have no substance. Yeah.
