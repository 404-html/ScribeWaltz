Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah, it's a problem. You know, like when you're thinking and talking at the same time, there's a bunch of words bouncing around in your head and you're just trying to, and you think you're saying the right thing when you're, you know, it's, that's why intent is so critical. George Carlin. Yeah. And magic words are so fucking dangerous, you know? And that is what I'm going to tell you about later. Yeah. You know about a specific comedian that we know and love.

Speaker 2:          00:23          Well, George Carlin was absolutely amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:27          Well, he wa he would, not only was he absolutely amazing, but people don't have to you, you almost have to have lived during the time where he was getting arrested like Lenny Bruce before him. But to understand how significant he was when he was doing that seven dirty words, you can't say on television. Like back then people were like, what the fuck is this guy doing?

Speaker 2:          00:48          Nigger, I was, I was far left men skin tight, black, you know, sheruts the virus. Uh, you know, the virus, punk rock bands, Antifa lag, things like that. I was trying to think of, it's been so long. I'm trying to think of some of the band shirts we used to have. And uh, man, we were, we were angry and pissed off all the time. I grew up like that. And then over time I learned, I went through a ton of really important life lessons. One of the first and most important was I was a young skateboarder in Chicago. Really looked up to some of these older guys who were really good. I went to Catholic school when I was younger. I ended up becoming this punk rocker guitar playing far left skin tight, you know, skateboarding, angry, Eh, no flags, you know, fuck the government.

Speaker 2:          01:28          And then I go to, this dude's house was just really great skateboard. He's got a picture of Jesus on the wall. And I immediately scarf like, um, um, you know, high MIT. I was like, I was like, what do you, what do you like a Christian or something? And he goes, no. And I was like, then, why'd you have a picture of Jesus? And he goes, oh, I just thought like a story about a dude traveling around helping people was kind of cool. And I went, oh, that's a good point. Wow. I was, I was like, I was like, wow, maybe I don't really understand.

Speaker 1:          01:52          Maybe maybe this means something different to other people. That show means to me. Well, if Jesus was an Indian man that had wooden beads and you know, and, and was a, a Hindu God, we would love him. You know, it'd be like Shiva Vishnu. We would, we would think he's the most amazing thing ever. It's the fact that if you look at what Jesus preached and what he was all about, I mean it seems pretty Ra I think it's about is spiritual and loving and it's, it's about, I mean it, his, his whole ideology that the Jesus of the Bible. Yeah. And he was essentially about loving your brother and treating people as if they are you. And,

Speaker 2:          02:31          but this, this for me, like I bring this up, cause it was kind of a formative moment where all of a sudden I realized was my ideology predicated on assumptions was I was I holding these views because other people told me to hold them. Right. That I actually understand it. There were some positive things on the other side. And then I slowly moved over to more of a center left position. And you know, now what w the reason I bring this up is I looked, I watched that video, I tweeted this, the video of George Carlin, cause man, George Carlin, uh, I used to watch this video was my, my, my mom would put them on and my mom's been a hippie liberal, far left, all that stuff. And you'd probably consider a conservative by today's, you know, measures the way things have been going. Now they look at, you know, Kevin Hart, he said a bad joke 10 years ago.

Speaker 2:          03:13          Get 'em out. Like, could you imagine, I, God forbid, what would happen with George Carlin's routines today? They wouldn't, they would be running all of his old routine saying, no, you've got to ban him from the shows. He literally called these people the n word. Why was it that George calling go onstage and talk about how Republicans were dom and how religion is crazy. He was clearly on the left his whole life. And he said these things that by today's standards would be considered conservative. Right. And so for me, it's a weird thing to go from being on the far left as a, as a young person that was around like 19 or 20 I started to become more moderate and then to see them today being extremely offended, like people used to be in the fifties and sixties to go from being on the far left as a, as a young person that was around like 19 or 20 I started to become more moderate and then to see them today being extremely offended, like people used to be in the fifties and sixties.
