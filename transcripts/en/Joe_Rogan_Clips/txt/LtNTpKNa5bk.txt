Speaker 1:          00:00          I'm reading this book now about, um, speaking of changing your brain, it's called a how to change your mind. God is Michael Pollan. Yeah. He's been on the podcast talking about, oh, no shit. Did he talk about his new book, about the, um, it, it's, it's basically about, uh, um, psychedelics and LSD and mushrooms in particular and tell it traces the whole fucking history of it. I had no idea how much research was done back in the fifties and sixties. I mean, they had conclusive studies that were showing with, um, alcoholism. People were 70% of people that underwent these treatments with psychedelics got sober. Oh, depression, cigarettes, cigarettes. I mean, it's amazing. And all that shit just got fucking thrown away.

Speaker 2:          00:51          Corrupt people kept that information away from folks. The studies that Nixon funded, like Nixon funded a bunch of studies that showed positive benefits of marijuana. How is that right? You know, the Nixon administration, just fucking,

Speaker 1:          01:05          can I get out of here with this shit not releasing this one. The other thing he mentioned is that it got squashed by, by shrinks because they had a vested interest in people not going into the woods for a weekend and coming back without their depression. So yeah, so they, so they disqualified all the studies. Oh fuck. Yeah. What psychiatrists were like horrified that there was these kind of results were coming back.

Speaker 2:          01:28          Was it that for sure? Or was it people who've never taken psychedelics horrified that people are out there experimenting with their consciousness? Because I think a lot of these psychiatrists are probably really straight laced guys. And so in their mind, especially in the shadows of reefer madness and all the propaganda they'd heard in the 30s and forties and when you look at those people and they're out there in the fucking desert or wherever they're going dancing around and taking mushrooms under the moonlight, you like, they're blowing their brains out here. You got to stop this. If they're straight laced people that have ever done psychedelics, they might not be in cahoots. It might more likely be a bunch of people that think it's a fucking terrible idea to let people run around and take an acid.

Speaker 1:          02:07          Well there was just some of the medical journals came out with, with pieces saying that none of these studies are valid because there wasn't a, I forget what it is about studies that have to be consistent. Um, but the other thing is it was political and you had Timothy leary who is, you know, the worst thing to happen to this kind of testing because he was saying was it drop, drop out in turn on, drop, drop out. And that whole idea, they said, you know, we're people taking LSD are not going to fight your wars. And so that became a threat to the status quo and that's when the law has started to come out. Huh. It's interesting

Speaker 2:          02:49          cause he also got a lot of people to get excited about it,

Speaker 1:          02:52          right? Yeah. But he got, he took it away from it being a, um, a medical

Speaker 2:          03:00          process and he made it about,

Speaker 1:          03:02          you know, enlightenment, but in a kind of fluffy spirit,

Speaker 2:          03:05          joy away. Well, he made it a big movement. Right. I think you saw that he was probably going to change the world with that movement. Yeah, we kinda did. It definitely had a big impact. You know, all those people that took acid. It's like, think about if you really stop and think about apple and you really look at the fact that apple, Steve Jobs said that taken acid was like one of the greatest things that ever happened to him. Yeah. That was his, it was famously talked about it. And who knows what a, what an impact that had on him deciding to start apple and what would an impact apple has had in the technology world.

Speaker 1:          03:43          Oh No. Paul and talks about it in the book. He draws a straight line from people starting to take all this stuff because it was happening in Silicon Valley. This whole psychedelic movement was like right in that area. And he says that it, you know, Bill, Bill Gates apparently took it once, but that all those guys were coming in and they were, you know, they, there were these people that would lead. There was a guy named, um, no Hubbard, well Ron doss has mentioned also, but there was guy named Hubbard who was really like, you know, a corporate version of LSD. He was going to companies and he was taking the CEOs of companies and taking them in for these three day drop acid experiences. Wow.

Speaker 2:          04:29          Corporate acid. Well, they're kind of doing that at burning man. Oh, is that right? Some corporations go to, I mean, not a lot, but there's some cool companies who go to burning man. Yeah. You know, what's this Alfred? Matthew Hubbard, he's an early proponent of the drug LSD. During the 1950s, he is reputed to be the Johnny Appleseed of Lsd and the first person to emphasize led lsds potential as a visionary or trends in dental truck.

Speaker 1:          04:58          Okay. But this guy had an a fucking life. Somebody's got to do a movie about his life. He, he was like working for the government. He was a double agent. He was, uh, while he was dropping acid. He was, he, he started with nothing. No, I think before, before, during and after. He had like eight different careers and he was like a spy and he bought it. He started with nothing and ended up with like a bunch of airplanes that he was leasing out, became a millionaire and then spent it all trying to educate people on Lsd. He was worth like tens of millions of dollars and he ended up broke at the end.

Speaker 2:          05:37          Wow. Yeah. Wow. All for the LSD,

Speaker 1:          05:42          he believed in it so strongly that said it was going to change the world and it would have, it may still now there's, now it's coming back.

Speaker 2:          05:50          Well, there was a little hiccup or several generations how to pass before people started understanding that there's there, there's a risk to everything. There's a risk to a sports. There's a risk to every fucking thing you do driving your cars are at risk. There's a risk with psychedelics, but there's also a reward and I think if you're going to be honest, do you have to look at both of them? You have to look at the potential risk. You have to look at the reward and they're not looking at the reward to try this. Too many people out there that are trying to deny the reward and you've got to find out why. And in this day and age it might be a conspiracy, it might be some pharmaceutical industry that doesn't want it to be legal because it would undermine their profits. It might be, it might be some law enforcement unions that think it's a bad idea to make less things illegal. It will take, you know, prisons. Yeah. It will take people away, you know, in terms of the amount of people that they need for the job. It'll, you know, which I think that's another story. But

Speaker 2:          06:48          when you, you know, and people look at that kind of stuff and you look at like the, the underlying sort of patterns that we follow in this country, you know, the patterns that we like, are you happy or not happy with the way things go? The way things are run.

Speaker 3:          07:10          Okay.

Speaker 2:          07:10          In what sense? Just in any sense. In all of it.

Speaker 3:          07:14          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:15          I trust that we do have the best system out there and we challenge it every day. And I still think that we live in a place where the tenants of our society are in place for sure they swing one way or the other, but I still believe in democracy. And um, I think the internet as an as an overall thing has been positive for people getting their voices out and for, for information period

Speaker 2:          07:44          being distributed. But the I, the idea that we're faced with that in this day and age, there's grown adults telling other grown adults what they can and can't put in their body. Yeah. And then not being honest about the benefits. Right. That's where it gets squirrely. That's where the whole thing falls apart. Like you're just a guy. Like if you and I are the only two people on the planet and he only came out, I'm not going to let you take that acid. Like why? Well, because it's illegal. Look, I wrote it down. Can, can't take the acid. Right. Well that would be preposterous. Yeah. But somehow or another, it works when there's a million people that a person could tell you, you know, if you're a fucking grown adult, you can't tell me what I can take. That's stupid. Yeah. If, if you can't prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that what I'm going to take is gonna fuck with you.

Speaker 2:          08:31          If you can't prove that, then stop. Yeah. Look, if someone does something, if takes something and does somebody take PCP and they've run phase first through a fucking seven 11 window that's on them, it's on their actions. It doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to try PCP and I don't think you should try PCP. I think when enough enough people smashed through windows and go crazy, you go, hey, maybe that's a drug I should fucking avoid. But that's how you find out about that. Yeah. You let grown adults make own decisions and if you're the one who's making the decisions for all the grown adults, you better have some real fucking logic to what you're saying it.

Speaker 1:          09:03          And this is the same society that allows the pharmaceuticals to peddle opiates to people for the last 30 years saying that it was the greatest thing you could do.

Speaker 2:          09:12          Exactly. I think it's good that they make money because they make medicine that helps a lot of people. They're not all bad. I think in general, pharmaceuticals have helped people in tremendous ways, but you can't deny that if there's some way, shape or form that people are influencing other people having access to beneficial things because it would impact their profit line. That's, that's evil. That's evil. You have a lot of fucking money. If you really going out of your way to hire lobbyists to make sure that mushrooms don't get on the table, come on, man. You're you are. You're a fucking real problem. That's a real problem. If you look at Yin and Yang, this is, this is the opposing forces that were battling to try to get total complete freedom of your consciousness. These are the opposing forces, their ignorance, like these psychiatrists, I guarantee you these psychiatrists were worried about correlations between psychotic episodes and psychedelic drug use and they're worried about people falling apart and they're right.

Speaker 2:          10:18          They're right. This are the ones that wanted to get it illegal debt, right. It's like working on backflips when there's a fucking thin pad under you. Yeah. You could fall on your head. Yeah, you're right. And we say, don't do gymnastics. People fall in their head. One out of 10 falls on their head. You're not doing chimney, not falling on your fucking head. Right. It's the same thing. It's the same thing. So people worried about it that don't really have experience in it. I guarantee you most of those psychiatrists just didn't have experience in it. Or we're super cautious folks is if they did have experiences with it, maybe they try a little mushroom dose and they'd be like,

Speaker 1:          10:51          wow, this is amazing. His brain and also controlling, um, you know, uh, s set and setting, they keep talking about, you know, and realizing that the, the, you know, occurrence of a psychotic episode is so much lower when it's, you know, when you're, when it's being dispensed the right way so much lower. You ever been led through it by somebody. Now when you did IOWASCA was there like a guy, EMT, Aubrey, my friend Aubrey acted as a sign of like set the setting. I'm in a way where it was, uh, you know, I would say like spiritual, like not

Speaker 2:          11:33          dot Riddick. Not over the top, but just announcing your intentions that we're going into this, we're going in this, we're going to let go,

Speaker 1:          11:43          we're going to give thanks.

Speaker 2:          11:46          The all, all the spirits around us and all the energy around us. Just go into this with a good intention. Give, be grateful. Be uh, go into it with gratitude. And then the way it hits you, it hits you like,

Speaker 4:          12:01          like a

Speaker 2:          12:02          infinite cyclone of geometric patterns in impossible colors. Just blasting in your brain instantaneously and you like, like going into it with the intention of letting go is probably one of the best pieces of advice you could give people to uh, avoid a freakout, right? Go with it, let it go. Just let yourself go. And it's what's trying to do is your ego is trying to wrestle with this grizzly bear. This enormous short face bear on steroids is trying to, your ego's trying to wrestle with is impossible to resist force. And that's what leads to a lot of people freaking out. So Iga, losing your ego is the ultimate goal of it. Um, I don't think anybody ever really loses her ego. I think you, you keep it in check. You lose some of it. You keep some of it because that's part of your survival mechanism that the real problem is like having a healthy ego. You know, like, uh,

Speaker 2:          13:01          like if your wife looks good and she's looking at herself in the mirror and she was like, I look good. You look fucking great. I do look good. Like she feels good. It feels everybody. That's ego, right? You want to know you, you look good, but it's not a bad ego. It's fun. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. The real problem is when it gets out of control and toxic than it looked like other people see it. They're like, if you, you know, you see gross, just gross behavior, grow selfishness, you see that you'll go, oh, that's the bad part of the ego. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. But the key is to know which is which, and that's hard. It's hard to know which is which. Which one is the overwhelming force inside your mind? Which one is the one that's controlling your consciousness and your behavior in which is, is it the good one, the bad one?

Speaker 2:          13:47          Is it the fun healthy one or is it the one that is a, you know, completely obsessed with yourself and only yourself? You don't know until you have these experiences. And then the, the, the nature of them gets exposed. It like takes him down to the roots and you start thinking about a, where did all this come from? Like where is it? Where's all, what's the source of all this? Like, oh, there's a validation issue. There's a this issue, there's a trust issue, there's a, you know, whatever the fuck it is. It's swirling out of that in this unnatural form to create the negative

Speaker 4:          14:20          behavior that you are or

Speaker 2:          14:24          manifesting in your life like it. All of it comes from something. And one of the things about psychedelic experiences is it shut it, like it shuts the ego off for a second and lets you stand outside of it and go look with the things Dunia look at this thing, things, grubs, and yeah, it doesn't work.
