Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah. There was a recent one. People are saying that his son did it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. My mother always believed that, but again, sense of conspiracy theory though. Right, and that's why I don't really get into, yeah. Yeah. That's, those are the ones that are out there. I don't really get into that. I don't come near the moon. I don't go near a, I'm not an Oj truther are you a a Gulf of Tonkin guy or operation Northwoods? Those were all true. There's nothing, there's nothing. Those are all true operation Northwoods is my favorite. Crazy. Yeah. They stay talked about bombing a ship. Yeah. With people on it and then we're going to blow up a drone jetliner and blame it on the Cubans. They were going to, they were going to attack Guantanamo Bay arm, Cuban friendlies and have them attack Guantanamo Bay. Crazy. Yeah. Yeah. That was not, that was not that long ago.

Speaker 1:          00:44          I know. That's why we need you back. I can't do it. We know what peer are too fucking exhausted. I got exhausting because I would do a show and then somebody would come up to me after this show and they'd be like, they'd show me a pizza menu. I swear to God, Nigga, you see that? And I go, no, what is it? They go, that's the nambla symbol. And I'm like, it says it says garlic knots. And they're like, no. They're like, you had to really look at it. Oh. And I'm like, all right, I can't go with the rest of my life with that. Will they look for it and everything. Everything's a conspiracy. And then when it comes back to you and they say, oh, Tim is involved in this, and then you go, oh, I see how this works. Yeah. Just make shit up.

Speaker 1:          01:25          Yeah. And then they believe it. You're the CIA is now getting involved in podcasting? Yes. Do you guys, you're their first shelf, but they're going to get a few others on the deeply involved in steam. Started the Russian trolls. I lived at the of the CIA going and watching sets and be like, who's getting passed at the store? Oh, you don't know. I have a friend of mine who thinks that the CIA started Jim Morrison and Jimi Hendrix. There's a book about that called Weird scenes inside the canyon written by a guy named Dave McCowen. Yes. I'm going to tell you right now, Joe, it's kind of interesting. I didn't tell you. It's kind of interesting. There was a lot of shit going on in Laurel Canyon. I'm sure it probably about pussy. There was a lot of weird shit going on. The CIA, the Rand Corp was all over there. There was a lot of shit happening. Well, I'm sure there was a lot of shit happening, but there is not a fucking intelligence agency in the world that can create a Jimi Hendrix of course, and they're not sitting there. That book was like that. They were managing the birds. The CIA was like, they were like, no, it's mister timber. Rattlers like a CIA guy. Gotta be like, it's tambourine meds.

Speaker 1:          02:33          Imagine being in that time in the country when everything was just falling apart left and right around us, Vietnam war, Kent State, just fucking Nixon's the president and it's just chaos left and right. There's no internet. Yeah, everyone's doing drugs. It must have been wild. It must have been amazing. I always think about that. A hunter s Thompson quote about, uh, you know, like we talked about the 60s and that in the 70s it was almost like the wave crested and then just it's crashed act from fear and loathing in Las pass. Yeah. Yeah. But I'm a big, like I'm a Kennedy Guy. I think there's something really shady with that. Yeah, for sure. For sure. For sure. I mean, that book, there's some amazing stuff. This book that you gave me, his family of Seo Secrets, a guy, Russ Baker, who's a legit journalist and it's, it's been praised by like Dan Rather and bill Moyers.

Speaker 1:          03:22          Man, I'm trying to get you in this. Let me tell you right now. This will get you in. We'll get you in. I don't have that kind of time for George H. Did you know the George Hw Bush called the FBI and said that he thought he knew who the killer of JFK was? Did you know that? No. No. He called the FBI. The in Houston. Hey, what's up? It's George George Bush. I'm in Tyler, Texas, and I think I know who the killer is. And he informed on this Guy James Parrot and James Parrot ended up being like one of his staffers. It was this weird cover story. He kind of planted and that came out in a memo and there was another mental, these are declassified FBI memos, freedom of Information Act. There was another memo that said after the assassination, j Edgar Hoover brief, George Bush and the CIA. The problem was George Bush should not have been working for the CIA at that point.

Speaker 1:          04:07          He should have been just a private citizen. So it was suggested he was working for the agency for a very long time and he was made the, uh, the director of the agency for one year after the family jewels came out, which was this whole thing with the CIA, went to Congress and they admitted that they had done all these things from, you know, coups and formenting revolutions and countries and they made him the director for one year after that happened to break to make a clean break from all of the nefarious activities that the agency had been involved with. But if you take that memo to mean that he had had an existing relationship with them, he was actually just becoming the door. Cause not, it made no sense to anyone. They were like, why is this guy that everyone called the lightweight becoming the head of the CIA after the CIA just admitted to all these horrible things?

Speaker 1:          04:52          They call them a lightweight. Yeah, they called. Yeah. He was like, I think Kissinger and said to Nixon, kissed her and said to Nixon like, he's a lightweight, admit him, ambassador to China. He was never a guy that had a serious political capital and he was made the head of the CIA and then after that memo was unearthed, people were saying, oh, he had, this was an extension of the coverup. He was being made, the director at this very interesting time in history because he actually had worked with the agency forever and he was not at all a lightweight. He was a serious operator and he was going in there to kind of clean up and transition them into a new era. It's a, I'm telling you, I'm already out. You're done. How are you out? I can't listen to that. It's good. It's great though.

Speaker 1:          05:32          I need current shit. I ended up at Denny's. I'm like, Julian Assan, I need something. Right. I need some Edward Snowden or done. All right. You know to the bush and I'll get an a sandbox. You can get in there. I'll listen to, I'm telling you in a clinic, if you read, if you, I'll dabble in the clinic. If you read a chapter of this, if you read a chapter of this, I give me a cookie. I don't have a cookie. And if I do, I'm taking it. But you will be, you'll be, it's very interesting and it's a well written book cause it's not reckless and slop. I'll read the first chapter, I promise. Thank you. I will listen to a buddy of mine gave me a David uh, Lifton's best evidence on the Kennedy assassination and that got me into conspiracy theorists is like 92.

Speaker 1:          06:20          And I get it. You're, you're at the end of the road now where you're like, this is a lot of people are full of shit in that world. A Lot, a lot of them. And that's what people don't realize. Well then it gets deeper and deeper and deeper and more and more preposterous. Have you ever googled Hashtag spaces fake? No, but that's sounds, it sounds amazing. There is a thriving space is fake community. Have you ever been in space? No. Good point. It could be fake. Come back. Come back to us. Joe. Prove it. Now what is space? Come back to him. Well, this is an extension of flat earth. It's like for people to think the flat earthers stupid conservative. They go, they go deeper. It's like it's not stupid. They go deep. Those flat Earth Cox, they want to move into space.

Speaker 1:          07:06          They want to go to spaces bank. Yeah. You want to know what's really up spaces face basis. Fake. Yeah. Crazy. What I mean I think there are hundreds of thousands of people that think that the earth is flat. Hundreds of thousands educated Western uh, American human beings that think the earth is flat. That is wild. It is fucking crazy. It's interesting. It's a lot of people that just get educated from youtube. The Guardian actually had an article about it. I sent it to Eddie and Eddie's laughed at me. See I think Eddie's kind of rational and a lot of ways, cause I met conspiracy talks with him about what about well yeah, no, the one that we had wasn't saying a little government was attacking Malibu. Well he's the one that came up to me about, we're talking about that they were using direct energy weapons and I was like, I dunno if this is Jackie Malibu, but with what?

Speaker 1:          07:54          I was like why would they attack mallet, whatever the fires. But I'm like, they're rich. Why would they attack mal boats to rich people? Fire started here. My fucking house. They start a mal, but they flew through the air. You know I was one of the first evacuated. Right. These fucking theories. You're so stupid. It's dry a shit. Yeah. A fire hits. The winds are going co did they make the wind picked? May Do. I am sure always made the wind. The wind is always been the CIA. They've always made the wind. Yeah. It's fucking, it's just any, there's no rest. There's no peace. There's no living in the moment. Certain point you go to just don't even want to know because it's horrible things going on. There's horrible things going on. Okay. What do you think is like the worst shit going on right now?

Speaker 1:          08:35          Human trafficking's. Very bad. Horrible, horrible and really dollar industry. That's not subway sandwich. Artists are paying for that. Right? Rich people, some of them are involved in some very bad things and they're, it's their track should be, they're covering their own tracks. Yeah. Like that. Jeffrey Epstein that the Clinton visited the least got an ice cream somewhere. Anyone with an island and hanging out with Bill Clinton. Yeah. If you have an island and you're hanging out with Bill Clinton, there's a problem. Where's the Mataz crazy. All of that stuff is very disturbing and he got a sweetheart deal cause he wouldn't inform on anyone that was on his plane and now they're the justice department is looking at that again. It'll probably be fine. They'll probably just let it, you know with a guy like that, like what? You know, how much does he know? How does it stay alive because it's the, he's not going to say anything.

Speaker 1:          09:33          Not going to talk. I wouldn't trust him if he files on that plane. I think that's the other thing about see the aversion of conspiracies as you go. Like nobody would, people would talk. The reality is people wouldn't talk if you were from a prominent family. If it had been like a religion to stay silent, if you had had CIA training, if you would. These people don't talk and we know that there have been plots that have gone on known for a very long time too in Iran. So guy like Jeffrey Epstein is so involved, so deep, he knows he'll get killed. He won't say anything. Yeah. He's not going to say anything. Plus he doesn't want to go to jail. He doesn't want to go to jail and he doesn't want to say anything. Middle of the things that he did. Yeah. So the, the, the child thing is the creepiest of all, it was gross and unfortunately it's, it's a, it's a real thing.

Speaker 1:          10:21          So what, you know, people you could talk about, there's the conspiratorial angles, the bullshit, but then there's the real feathers. Sandusky, Sandusky, like church hundred percent. That's how the fire, the people that are in love with conspiracies never care about private prisons or the Catholic Church. And I'm like, guys, this is not even debatable. Right? We're not even debating. Right. Private prisons are ruined. Kids are being sold into slavery. Ryan, about how horrible the judge in Pennsylvania, crazy taking an underage kids and just giving them sentences, ridiculous sentences for shit. That's crazy. Exchange for money. That's not right and now he's in jail. Yeah. It's uh, there's some darkness in the world. It's undeniable and when something like San Dusky, when that Penn state thing comes out and you're like, wait a minute, how long was this going on for and how many people knew? Everyone knew. How does everyone know?

Speaker 1:          11:10          Yeah, it's crazy. Turnover. Just he died quick, but this is what I'm course but doesn't mean he destroyed. This is what I mean about people where it's like youtube is gonna like central conspiracy theory type stuff. I'm like, all of those things would have been called conspiracy theories at one point. Yes. Catholic church. Sandusky, blue grade, and they said it was a few bad apples. It was a labyrinth of torture. Prisons. It was a program designed by the Pentagon. CIA. It's crazy. What is the youtube going to do? They're going to censor recommending. I think they just not recommending conspiracy videos from what I've heard, but I was reading that thing that you were telling me about Jamie. This whole like porn or child porn or pedophile network, you're setting account of what is this, a pedophile, youtube, what's going on in communication network. They were communicating with each other and youtube comments ever responded yesterday and they said that they uh, disabled comments on tens of millions of videos and deleted a lot of accounts that were, they were communicating in the comment section of like a little kid's cheerleading and whatnot.

Speaker 1:          12:17          How were they communicating to try to, to share child porn or where they are communicating to molest. You don't know in the way pedophiles communicate and their network, but I'd like you to do a little bit more work. Pull up an article on due diligence on the pedophile. I want you to go under the dark web burner computer for the download Tor and let's get moving. We got to figure shit out. You got to get a VPN or there that's the FBI will take over child points had on tour and then Ronnie for a year you become the talk. Wait, what is that? What's going on? I imagine what they see to see that that's a problem. It is a problem because you're causing, that happened that our Kelly Case, there's a video of him doing something with an underage girl and like I think some people at CNN, it's like we've seen it but and that's led to him going, it's like, well what did you watch?

Speaker 1:          13:09          And is that legal? Probably as legal cause you're watching under the guise of of dining out rough. Yeah. That kind of Shit is real. And the fact that there's these networks of people that are trying to, you know, cultivate these experiences. It's crazy man. But if you're a rich person, you have that sick predilection, you're going to find a way to think of what they're doing. Like uh, for example, okay. The poster remarks that praise the girls ask whether they were wearing underwear or simply carried a string of sexually suggestive emojis. Bout two years ago, hundreds of companies pulled money from Youtube over concerns about ads showing up next to problematic content from terror or hate groups and videos is seem to endanger exploit children. I think, you know, we've talked about this before with youtube with the issues that we've had with them. They, they have way too much content and way too few people.

Speaker 1:          14:07          There's no way they can watch all of it. And when Shit like this where people are doing things in the comments, it's almost impossible to check. Yeah. I mean it's just the youtube comments are one of the rare free range sort of like unchecked message boards in the, in the world. I'm sure I'll find out later. Don't read it. Don't read it Bro. Who is this fat fuck don't, it's not even a black ballerina. Why is he here? Who is that? Don't read it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, I wonder if there's ever going to be a time where that is impossible, where like these child pedophile rings, they can figure out a way to snuff all that out. I'm harder now than ever before. I'm imagining. It's very tough and it's tough, I think, because so few people want to believe that it's a problem in the way that it is, because there's good people in the world that don't think these things are issues, right.

Speaker 1:          15:01          So I think there's, the political will isn't there because people don't, aren't really, they don't understand that it's, you know, and then the people that are doing these things are very wealthy, powerful people, and they have a lot of control and they can kind of cover their tracks. If they're all wealthy on all of them. For poor pedophile, you're not going to a ring. What are they doing? Some kid, I know it's bad, but if you're rich, pedophile, it's a nicer experience. It's like you go on vacation versus me going on vacation, you go on vacation. It's a nice experience. I go on vacation, you know, it's fine. Sandals in The Bahamas. No scandals where you go on a cabin or something.
