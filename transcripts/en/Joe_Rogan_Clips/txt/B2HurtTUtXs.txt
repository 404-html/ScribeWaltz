Speaker 1:          00:00          The Bible says the Old Testament New Testament, which is pretty powerful. I know people misinterpret itself, but it's ancient tax. The people that are there like, well, you read Zinky like three burning wheels land. There's a blue from in over 10 it gives me something to take. I take it and give him the full data of the plan that that, that, that the genetics has been infested in. God must destroy everyone. That's an alien story. Oh, it's 100% but that's what they always talk about. There was talking about that being an alien story. That's why one of the primary stories when they, when we talk about the Bible, Ezekiel's vision, a wheel within a wheel that they always thought of, you read it, it says floating off the ground and the Hebrew and the King James is pretty clear to floating comes a thing with a crystal from it over its head and then the face of shifting different creatures.

Speaker 1:          00:45          It's like a video screen. Well, if you think about how long it would take for an alien to get here, it really only makes sense that unless they have a constant basis in a robot they visit, or if they, if they came by themselves, they came by themselves a long fucking time ago. Like if they were able to make interstellar travel like two, 3000 years ago, which is not that big of a leap. If you think about us 3000 years from now, we probably can do something like that, right? So if they were doing that 3000 years ago and they found human beings, and these are the stories that we have, these stories like a Zeke, you'll and like, uh, there's a bunch of different ancient stories about contact with the skies, you know, the, uh, changing to tabulation. Yeah. There's a world government, the beach is 50 feet tall.

Speaker 1:          01:28          It shifts. Everyone can see it the same time. It's a Hologram. And you've got these digital systems. If you don't go along when you can't buy her shell, people say, oh, that's not real, but it's manifesting and then go 2000 years. In the future. They have advanced technology. They don't send people anymore and now they send aliens. If you go back to the old days, it was actually some sort of humanoid or a large thing like all the Zachariae sitch and shit. The covers and Sumerian texts. Exactly. That's what I'm, I make sense. That's what all those guys are telling you. Like Avatar, James Camera's definitely dialed in. It's like, no, we're there jack. They're jacking him. Well, it makes sense that if there was a visitor to this planet five 10 15,000 years ago, if there was maybe more, maybe if there was a visitor hundreds of thousands of years ago that actually did genetic experiments on lower hominids.

Speaker 1:          02:15          If that was really the case, it makes sense that their technology, would it increase far more rapid, but let's go pass that. Obviously scientists like to plant things, gardeners like to plan things and, but that's Joe. That's exactly what the globalist believe is that maybe they're just aware of what the fuck's going on. There was powerless as we are. If they're reading more and more, they only put soulless people in charge who are compartmentalized. Nobody else knows who will carry the shop. But we're able, because we're advanced, look at this because let, let's just get down to brass tax tax. I love tax law. No, Joe, you just said it instead of some weird dumb preacher, you know, and in Alabama, not bashing Alabama sang stuff. You'd get mad at this. Don't look at watch. So demonized. Look at why it's demonized. Think about that, right? Think about how it shares.

Speaker 2:          03:04          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:05          That there's no reality and god creates a whole new virtual reality, gives light, does all of it, and then his genetic experiment by rogue elements gets involved. It's all right there. When you actually look at it and you expand on it and you're like, oh my God, this is like beyond a science fiction book. And so it's the obvious thing. That's why they keep telling us, oh look, Piltdown man, all this fake stuff. No, Joe, they did an accelerated immunogenic. They're doing Jewish now. Something new. They did an accelerated immunogenic program on this planet and humanity. What? What does the Bible start with? Pick as we are made in the image of God. What does that mean? We don't have God's knowledge. We don't have God's advancement. We're the image. Well, what does an image? It's a scan. It's numbers. It's the genetics. It's the potential. So we are the aliens. Joe and everybody already knows this. We are the aliens. Do you think that we are a product of alien intervention? They took these lower hominids and they accelerated their evolution by applying their genetics.

Speaker 2:          04:07          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:07          Do you know we, here's the deal. They say we're 97% chimpanzee, but then they actually get into the deeper genetics. We're closer to pigs are Rach show. I think that this was an environment built for us. We're the master genetic program and they're are all subsets of us. Just for a backstory. Uh, and that's what the loveless thing. Yeah, but do you think that the aliens created us? Like this is like one of the primary what? The elite beliefs, right?

Speaker 1:          04:34          The elders are biological. Android's the grayish and then there's other systems going on and no one knows because it's all warfare, psychological stuff. No one knows. The truth is it's, it's virtual reality once you get to that level. So no one knows. We just don't, we're advanced. But we are, and I'm not just answering a rifle. Powerful. The globalists are obsessed. The elites are obsessed because she reportedly, obviously humans are pretty fricking cool. We've got some big giant mission and maybe that's a program, I don't know that we're like pretty super advanced, but you can't put something out like the Spartans were when their kids were seven, they throw him out for two years in the woods. You can't just put something out like, like, like, like liberals. You give her very everything. There's a little hassles show. This is like bootcamp and training and they, so they had the testis and do all this.

Speaker 1:          05:21          And basically this planet is what the people say. It's a big testing ground for other things that are going to come. And we are at, we are God. And I don't mean I'm God, I'm already God. I've achieved godhood cause you could see that potential on your shelf and and the, and the, and the lower level ELLs will tell you that because they already know you're bad ash. But if they can trick a tadpole, it's going to grow into Godzilla to they'll kill itself. They're winning. So you show some of the cash. The elves are a test on us to attack us and, and and she the survival of the fittest but they're nothing. They're like, well by by the time we've achieved conscious and we look back and go, we're not going to look at it that because I think when you jumped the next level, there's even bigger war going on. What's the biggest war?

Speaker 1:          06:05          Consciousness of the universe is an interdimensional spacecraft. Beyond that then looks like a comment from my research and it has, it has its head as its corona. That's consciousness consciousness. He carries evil in the tail end. The consciousness has a location. No, there is this giant consciousness. God, okay. Swimming in a giant system of survival, a fitness that God has created a test God self. Okay, looks like a comment. So you've got God's conscious and all the good things, the knowledge going forward, but God knows that everybody has to be tested. So the tail goes out and at the end of the tail is basically evil. That's why Christ says, get behind me, Satan. And it's always trying to test God and infiltrate up into it to sabotage. Damn. If they do pull the plug in. This podcast is a good way to end this motherfucker.

Speaker 1:          06:58          I of your burnout one is fit. Oh, I'm not, I'm just saying it 1,300 and something. If the fucking governments come in, but shell, they love [inaudible]. You guys have been talking about aliens so much, dude, trust me. This is not the move. Biggest youtube videos of all is that the move to talk about aliens as much as possible. They allow me to shut up, let me call over children's program one bs alien stuff. Or were they come out of space? It's interdimensional Eddie. Well, when you say alien to tell you that you're talking to them, the Kadian, that's what it sounds like. Literally believe they're in contact with these things. Well, maybe they are probably to describe what you saw DMT and you, you tell us you have these experiences where thoughts become patterns. They become like geometric patterns that are moving through space and they change and shift, but they're letting you know that they know all your bullshit.

Speaker 1:          07:49          They see right through you and they want the want is creation. They want you to relax. Yes. There is a lot of that. There's a lot of thought as creation. Yes, but but with the only oh, relaxed. Just so you don't struggle. No one to call them aliens though. What I saw, I never referred to them as a, but that's the term. Everyone knows not of this world. None of our average thing. I would listen, I would think it was aliens. If it woke me up in the middle of the night and it took me a board, a ship and that's what I experienced, how it'd be 100% convinced that I went to an alien spaceship and I talked to these things, the differences, how it was like to smoke it and then laid back and then experience. That is like I expected that progression of events but if I woke up in the middle of the night I was going to take a leak and a a light shone down to the bathroom and they stuck me through the window.

Speaker 1:          08:36          It took me a board, a space ship and I saw the exact same thing that I saw when I was high on DMT. I'd be 100% convinced that I was in contact with aliens. The different, the only difference is how I got there. Like I got there through a drug. I got there through smoking, something that's produced by the human brain that I knew it was pretty safe. No one's ever died of it. I'm like, let's what happens? And all that goes back to everyone I've talked to in mash groups taking particularly Iowasca yeah. They have group events and see the same things. They hear the same thing. Yes. Yeah. Which is the psychic connection. But it's beyond that. You could argue a one person's a psychic leader. They projected everybody else's minds. But who's projecting that into them? So that's the only way it's out. This, this is one of the Pentagon. It will, it might not be someone projecting anything into your mind. It might be your new found ability to perceive things that you could. The way I look at it, it's like, no, I agree, but why are they all 43 people? You know, in Costa Rica, all shooting aliens.
