Speaker 1:          00:00          Right. Do you think that it's possible? Do you ever entertain the idea that it's possible that we are the only intelligent life in the known universe? I like, I tend to restrict myself to the galaxy, right? So I do think it's possible that at the moment there's one civilization in the Milky Way and that's us. And I think that's important. Actually. It goes back to, I was saying at the start about the, uh, astronomy and cosmology being part of the framework within which you have to think if you're looking for meaning or you're looking for how we should behave even politically. You know, the, that has a bearing to me, I mean, imagine that we're the only place where there is intelligence in this galaxy and how should we behave, right? Should we actually not withstanding the fact that we are tiny and fragile things and insignificant physically, should we consider ourselves extremely valuable in that respect because there's nowhere else where you, you know, that I would go as far as to say there would be nowhere else where meaning exists in the Milky Way.

Speaker 1:          01:08          Because meaning it's one of those things that scientists don't talk about very much. Although Richard Fineman, one of my great heroes did talk about it. There's a quote where he says, what is the meaning of it all? It's a great essay called the value of science and so what is self evidently true is that meaning exists here because it means some things he was so that's kind of an obvious statement. Your life mean something to you and me and so meaning exists, but I think it is a local and temporary phenomenon. I think it's, it emerges meaning emerges from configurations of atoms, which is what we are. We are simply that. We're nothing more than that. We're very, very rare configurations of atoms I think and so that means that we are, if you go all the way down that line of logic, we are the only island meaning in the galaxy.

Speaker 1:          02:03          I meaning only to ourselves. Yeah. It means something to us because we're the only ones who can grasp the concept and we are finite. We are finite organism. We have this temporary existence while we're here and to us there is meaning. Yeah. And that's, I don't know any other way to define it, so I'll define it like that. I don't think there's globe. Yeah. Otherwise you have to believe there's some kind of global meaning and that's a god thing. I don't think that's, I think it's more wonderful and, and more challenging to us because we have to take responsibility for it to say we should operate search that we are it in this galaxy. There's nothing else. I'm sure. I'm just, I'm sure there are other civilizations out there in the universe because are 2 trillion galaxies. I, I just can't believe this hasn't happened in other places.

Speaker 1:          02:57          The question is how often does it then, how widely spaced out of civilizations and I think they're very widely spaced and I think there may be one or two per galaxy on the average. I could put that as you said, that what you said at Beazley that what else can we think? Right. Well and what else do you want? I mean, I think what it says is you have to take responsibility for all those things or spiritual things that you think about and the emotional things you think about it. You, you, you are, you are responsible for that. You are that for that, whatever that is, it exists in you and it will only exist for short amount of time and so

Speaker 2:          03:38          well, you know, make the best of it will be my beats. So unbelievably compelling though to consider the idea that somewhere out there there's another civilization that may be even more advanced than us and this, this thought of it is just so attractive. It's, it's, it's incredible.

Speaker 1:          03:57          They're the shit there should be, if, if civilizations are common or even slightly common, then there should be civilizations ahead of us because there's been so much time. But wouldn't you want to see what that's like? Yeah. I mean, we've been a compelling, you imagined the timescales we've been around as a civilization, let's say 40,000 years. I don't know how long our civilization has been around. Let's say that the, the, the galaxy is pretty much as old as the university's 13 billion years worth of time. So the idea that there are no, no civilizations, arrows, you know, a hundred million years ago, 200 million years ago, 1 billion years ago. And imagine what they be like if they'd survived. I mean, we've been, we've been around, we've had science for let's say Cindy to neaten are Kapernick is 500 years at most. We've had, and look what we've done, we've, we've gone beyond the solar system with voyager.

Speaker 1:          04:52          We've walked on the moon. Um, we've, we're, we're about to go to Mars, I would think. So we're about to begin colonizing our own solar system. Um, so we've done that in 500 years. So imagine a million years in the future. So I would, it's one of the arguments often used to say, there aren't any civilizations out there in the galaxy. It's called the Fermi paradox. Because if you imagine a civilization that's a million years ahead of us, they should have written their presence across the sky by now. They should use to see them. I mean, you'll see us if we survive in million years into the future. Actually, even a few thousand years in the future, we will be exploring the galaxy. We will have spacecraft that are going to have the stars. We will be doing it. So our signature will become visible. I'm sure if we last into the medium term, would we choose to

Speaker 2:          05:45          not do that? Here's my thought on that is uncontacted tribes like, do you know about the, the gentleman who was the, a missionary who visited North Sentinel Island? Yeah. It was killed by the natives north central island, which is a really unusual place because they branched off from Africa 60,000 years ago and they've been living on this one small ion, the size of Manhattan. And as well as we know, there's only about 39 of them left somewhere around there. And um, we can't, we're not supposed to contact them like people were not supposed we, we're supposed to like leave them alone. And there are rare tribe when they find them in the Amazon. The uncontacted tribes are initial instinct is back off back when you leave them alone. Leave them alone. Do you think that perhaps the universe, like if there is a civilization that's a million times more advanced than us and been around here for you know, the millions of years of life as opposed to quarter million, why would they, why would they let us know?

Speaker 2:          06:42          They look at us dropping bombs on each other and polluting the ocean. It's sucking all the fish out and putting the clouds into the skies of dirt and particles and why would they like look at these crude monkeys. Look are there, they don't, they're so far beyond where they need to be before they could join the galactic civilization or whatever. It is true. It's an argument that the reason argument as well, the IT technology so advanced would be difficult for us to detect. I mean we tend to think of, you know, when you say written across the sky, I suppose it's true, I'm thinking of star ships and things like star wars, right? Big Energy. Things that you can see the signature of, but actually it may be that the civilization just becomes a nano civilization in a tiny little, none of it because that's more efficient. It's a better way to do things. So it's possible, I suppose, that there are space probes all over the place. They're so small and it's so efficient and you sell, it'll energy that we just don't see him. I suppose that is possible.
