Speaker 1:          00:00          The way. It's not mark that joke anymore. There's a good strong, well that's the weird wings of a butterfly that becomes a hurricane, right? Like we need to go back in your life and think about weird little lefts you took or rights you took when I have a bunch of those. When I had three months ago, I had a heart attack when I was on the table because of the good doctor was just like, uh, you, uh, you have, uh, a hundred percent occlusion in your lad. And I was like, I don't know what that means. He says, your lad is, you're a, is that main artery that goes across the front of your heart? He's going, uh, it's a hundred percent occlusion, means a hundred percent blocked, you've got cholesterol is blocked, there's no way for blood to get through. And that's what's creating your mass part of tech.

Speaker 1:          00:39          So he's like, we're going to, we're going to take care of it right now. He goes, but you're a comic Book Guy, right? I said, yeah. And he goes, you'll like this, that artery that's called the widow maker. And I said, why? And he goes, because 80% of cases of 100% occlusion, the patient always dies. He's gone, but you're going to be in the 20% because I'm really good at my job. And he fucking disappeared into my crotch, one of my groin to my femoral artery and fucking went up into my heart and put a stent in that, in that lad. And the moment he opened up, he goes, I'm gonna open it up now. And he showed me what it was, tiny little mesh wire thing. He goes, I'm gonna open it. Boom. Suddenly it was like, I, cause that artery had been like a hose.

Speaker 1:          01:17          If you bend it and it's fucking full of water and shit was pushing down in the heart, which was in turn pushing down on my lungs. I had no idea it was having a heart attack. I just thought like I couldn't catch my breath. I thought it was too hot. It was in between shows in between two gigs. That was the filming. We shot them both while we were going to shoot them both. We only shot the one because I had the heart attack and we didn't do the second one, but it was for, uh, for the folks at comedy dynamics and it became a showtime special. So we were shooting two shows that night. It was meant to be like an hour and an hour. But you know, once you get up there I feel like I'm fucking rolling. I'm rolling. So I did two hours and after the first show they were like, we don't even need to do the second show.

Speaker 1:          01:51          We can cut an that we're only cutting an hour out of it. So you gave us plenty and stuff. I said, I got two different hours so I want to do the second show. And plus everyone was there. They were lined up. And so I took a big swig of fucking milk cows, dairy drinker, heavy dairy drinker. In those days I've since become Vegan ice, be happy now I'm fucking Vegan. But uh, I took a big swig of milk, then I went to the green room and I chitchatted real quick with Jordan, who runs our company as Jason's wife, chase muses, wife. And, uh, Emily was there, she does my hair and makeup, so we're Chitchat. And then I was like, man, I feel fucking weird. I feel sick. I feel like I'm gonna throw up. Can you guys get Outta here? Cause when I get sick I just want to go off like an animal and fucking die alone.

Speaker 1:          02:31          Like I don't want to be ministered to. I'm like fuck off and shit. So they were like, yeah, totally. And I laid down on the floor and I felt like nauseous, nauseated and I never feel sick like that and wound up throwing up some bile, nothing chunky but just like fluid. And so I was like, well, and maybe I'll feel better now. Stood up and I looked in the mirror and I was just swamped man. Like now as a heavy dude, you sweat when he fucking breathe. But this was like, I'd look like I'd just come out of the pool and I felt really cold. I couldn't get warm and ship. Emily popped her head and she's like, are you okay? I was like, no man. Can you turn on like a hairdryer and just like draw me off. I feel fucking freezing cold. And she touched the back of my neck while she's driving me.

Speaker 1:          03:08          She's like, you never feel like this. This is scary. You should do something. I said, yeah. I said I would still want to do that second show as like someone to find a couch, just find a cash for me to lay down. If I get like a half hour nap, I'm sure I'll be fucking fine. And I couldn't get comfortable on the couch, couldn't sleep. And that's when I started not being able to catch my fucking breath. So you know, I'm no doctor but like fucking you think you know, I know my body and I know what this is. I smoked too much weed and I've got too much mucus in my fucking chest. That's all this is. So I said, I better sit up and put my arms up like this because that will help me breathe. And Jordan comes around the corner eventually and she sees me.

Speaker 1:          03:47          She's like, oh, you're right. And I was like, you know, having a hard time catching my breath. I could breathe. I just can't get all the way to the top and stuff of the breath. Can't take a full fucking breath. I was like, ah, maybe I, maybe we shouldn't do that second show after all. And she goes, we already canceled it. And I was like, why the fuck did you cancel the second show? And she was like, cause I'd never seen you sick like this. He's gone, you know this, this is weird. Something's going on. I said, yeah, maybe I should see a doctor. And she goes to Sunday night, all doctors are closed. So we called an ambulance. I was like, why the fuck did you call an ambulance? Oh my God, this is don't, this is embarrassing. She's like, they're already here. And six fireman came into the room, big brawny fucking dude's when he called paramedics, fire department comes as well.

Speaker 1:          04:25          So, uh, they're looking at me cause I'm sitting in the chair with my arms up and like there were, some of them were young, four of them are young. And I looked, they looked at me like, why is silent Bob celebrating a fucking touchdown? You know, and she doesn't like all of a sudden the medics came in and they, uh, there was a guy and a girl and the guy puts a cuff on me. He goes, how you doing man? I said, good, I can't really catch my breath. And, uh, he goes, well, we're gonna look at you right now. Put this Kufanya you ever had this done? I said, Oh yeah, I know how to do this. And then the girl had a, uh, like look like a fishing tackle box. I had a bunch of leads, wires coming out of it and shit, she put that down as heart monitor thing, you know, they get your fucking blood pressure, all that shit on one arm.

Speaker 1:          05:02          Then the other thing they put on your chest to monitor what's going on inside. So she's like, I got to put these wires on you as okay. And I'm sitting in the chair and this is 40 pounds ago and sitting is no good angle for fucking fat guy to begin with and shit like that. So she just yanks my fucking hockey shirt and the undershirt up and every tiddy I have falls out of my fucking shirt in front of these people and there's a room full of people and I'm like, oh, lead fucking shit. And I yanked my shit down. She's like, what are you doing? I was like, man, that's my fucking best friend's wife over there. She never seen my fucking tits. My wife's never seen much. It's like, I can't, you don't Yank my shirt up like that. She goes, Hey, get these wires on you.

Speaker 1:          05:40          I said, well, oh the shirt are you reach up under and put them on my chest. He goes, how am I supposed to seek? And I was like, do you just use my nipples as guideposts? Like it was, you know, I've spent all of my life trying to hide my fucking fat and when your life is in danger, I've never been in that situation. But when your life is in danger, nobody gives a fuck about your fucking ego and shit. Like their vanity. So they looked at their info and they realize, I guess what was going on. And they were like, we're going to take you to the hospital just to be safe. And I was like, don't do that. That's fucking embarrassing and shit. And they were like, Nah, we're so close man. It'll be fun. You ever been to the hospital? I was like, no, not really.

Speaker 1:          06:14          Feel like it's all so fuck. It's fun. He goes, you're gonna have a good time. I was like, all right. And you know, I'm a podcaster, so I'm like, look, at the end of the day, no time is wasted. Everything's a fucking story. So if this turns into the opening five minutes of Hollywood Babylon where I'm like, they took me to the hospital and it turned out it was just too fucking high. Like it's life's great when you're a podcaster because there's no such thing as fucking bad news anymore. Like it hit, it can hit you on the level of like, Oh shit, that's unfortunate. But right away you repurpose it into like, all right, well I've got something to talk about. And this latest setback is just the longest is just a momentary chapter in the long story. Or fucking tell him. So I was happy to go to the hospital and not because I was like, I think I'm dying, but because I was like, all right, fuck it.

Speaker 1:          06:56          I'll have a story to tell after this next week. It'll be fun. I got to the hospital like Dr Laden, Jaime's the guys now, my cardiologist, they pulled me into the er and he's like, hi, how are you? I'm Doctor Leighton him and said, hey man, how are you? He goes, well, what's wrong? What's going on? And I said, I can't catch my breath. Um, and he goes, well, that's because you're having a massive heart attack. And it was the first time anyone had said anything like that. How did he know for sure if that's what he does? I think what he knew for sure was when they put the leads on me and the blood pressure, they looked at each other at one point, but I assumed like in like numbers that'll show up to indicate that something just happened and they made this wonderful call. I've got to find these kids, give him a hug one day.

Speaker 1:          07:36          Ah, on the call sheet because we were shooting that night on the call sheet. It was a different hospital, but they took me to Glendale Adventist because they knew that I was in having a cardiac episode and that's shy of one hospital in New York. Glen Dale Adventist is one of the best cardiology wings in the United States of America. So I happen to be in the right fucking place at the right time. We were supposed to shoot my comedy special at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. Um, it wound up being shot instead at the Alex in, in Glendale and stuff. And if I hadn't been doing the show there, who fucking knows man, I'm gone to a hospital but I probably might've fucking died cause homeboy told me when he went up the heart when I was in the operating room and he told me like, they call that the widow maker and shit, 80%, 80, 20.

Speaker 1:          08:25          I sat there going like, these are the weirdest Todd's I've ever had in my life. I figure like, look, you leave the house, it's 50 50, you're going to fucking drop dead. Right. They get hit by a car struck by lightening, you can trip over fucking dog and then the dog bites your juggler and you fucking bleed out your look. But I always loved dogs and you die ironically, but uh, you know, just stringing along. But the 80 20 men, 20% chance of life was fucked up, fucked up thought. First time I'd ever had that kind of thought. And in my head I had to cognitively reframe it and go, you don't know, you might've been close to death so many fucking times in your life. There might've been like a psycho behind you with a fucking knife and then all of sudden you've got a cell phone call and forgot about you or something like that.

Speaker 1:          09:04          So suddenly our repurposed it the whole time I was laying on the table, I'll get repurposing everything, not repurpose and cognitively reframing. I was sitting because I couldn't like at one point they were like, your wife's on the phone. Do you want to say you want to talk to her? After they told me that I was having a heart attack and that they had to get up and be fast and stuff. So they're holding up a phone and I see it and as the first time a crystallized where I was like, oh, these, these people think I'm going to die. Like I didn't. I was in no pain whatsoever. I couldn't catch my breath. They kept asking me like zero to 10. How do you feel? What's your pain level? I was like, negative three. They'll look, you're doing this wrong. I didn't feel pain.

Speaker 1:          09:39          It wasn't like, yeah, I grew up in the 70s watching Sanford and son. So my idea of a heart attack is loose, but that's big and shit felt none of the symptoms, no numbness in the arm, anything like that. I was sweating a, I threw up bile, a little bit of bile. Um, I was cold and, and what was the last one? It was just fucking shit. You would never associate with a heart attack. And like you would associate it with like, oh, I just, I feel under the weather. But apparently these are symptoms of heart attacks as well. I like to share it because some cats never heard that before. And I've seen a lot of people on social media since we were like, you saved my life. Here's why. Because I talked about the fucking symptoms and shit. So while I'm laying there and they go up, you're growing, they go up your femoral artery to your heart and stuff.

Speaker 1:          10:23          He went up and he saw that it was all blocked. He, I said later on I was just like, fuck man. Like I'd like dropped 80 pounds three years ago. I've been like walking up a hill mile and a half every day and stuff. He goes, yeah, but the kind of blockage you had you go to that didn't start fucking recently. He's gone. That started in childhood and I was like, man, fucking hostess Twinkies. And then I remembered we had no money so I was like, man, fucking little Debbie Swiss delights and shit. That's how it happened. It started with a little Debbie cakes. I'm with you cause I was raised Dunham and shit. But you know, we were trained to like Twinkies more because they had a commercial little, Debbie would never bother with a commercial. They didn't have a commercial did day. No, you can't. Well, the leaders later they did, but when we were kids, they didn't because how can you have a commercial and sell your product, but they're only 9 cents a bottle? Easter cake. It's like a better experience because they had more of those trans fats that have trans fats back then. I think so. And then they could call and fats.
