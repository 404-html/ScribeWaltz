Speaker 1:          00:00          I really wonder if there's, there's a bottlenecks for progress that are going to be that we're going to run into. And I think, um, uh, ultimately inflammation is one of the big ones. And information also in a lot of ways is money. You know, I mean when we think of money we're, we're thinking of ones and Zeros that are being moved around on bank accounts. It's data. I mean it's attributed to different people and you get to do more things because you have more of these numbers and more of these things. But what is it really? It's not gold based anymore. It's not a physical material, a material object that you're coveting now it's some weird thing and it's kind of like information on a database. And what if we get to a certain point in time, and I, I sort of feel like in this weird vague abstract way we're moving towards this with all, it's one of the things that I want to really step back and wonder about this trend towards socialism and, and social democratic thinking.

Speaker 1:          01:02          I wonder what that is and I honestly think that we're moving towards this idea that, hey, you know, we've got a lot of fucking problems that could be cured if you move some of that money around and, but, but should you be able to move some of that money around? And when, what happens if that money becomes something different than what if people start developing social currency instead of financial currency would have your ability to do things was based on how much you actually put in. I mean, we're assuming, right? We assume that the way we do things now where if you want to buy a car, you have to have $35,000 that's how much a Mustang costs and you've got to bring it to the bank and this and that. And you can prove alone. But what if we get to a time in the future where it's not these pieces of paper that gives you material objects but rather your own actions and deeds provide you with social currency that allows you to go on vacations or allows you to eat at restaurants.

Speaker 1:          02:01          It allows you to do things. And there's this running tally that's not outside of the realm of possibility. No, I think it reward systems within everything that we're using are gonna are gonna rise up. I mean that, that's, that's what we're already kind of doing. I mean, we, we reward tokens for, for activity. We're going to see that rise up in more things that we're doing. But what I'm saying is if we're doing it in, if it's a social currency and that your own personal behavior allows you to access more freedoms or, or more goods or more things, it would encourage positive behavior and community based behavior because that would be the only way to advance. I mean, obviously this is a long time down the line, but when the first caveman, you know, traded the first fucking shiny rock for the first spearhead, you know, whatever it was that they did that started this whole inevitable trend towards money.

Speaker 1:          02:57          This is not something that has to be this way forever. You know, and I w I wonder when we're looking at the distribution of information, which is arguably not arguably, it's never, never been like what we have today. There's never been a time in human history where everyone had so much access to information that you used to have to pay for. He used to have to go to schools. You have to use to have to earn your way to the position where you could open the very books that had all this information in at night, get it off your phone. It's instant. And I, this is a whole different way of interfacing with information and I think this is going to affect higher learning institutes. I think it's going to affect a lot of different things, but I wonder if this all can be applied ultimately some day, maybe not in our generation, but someday to money that people start using social currency and that social currency is going to be almost like we have some sort of a, a database of social currency in this country.
