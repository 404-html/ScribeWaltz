Speaker 1:          00:00          There's a lot of people that are dying in Mexico because the cartel violence, you know, we were talking about that Jamal could Shogi guy before the podcast started and how disturbing this whole thing is. And the plot for folks who don't know what we're talking about l fill people in on. Okay, sure. So, uh, Jamal, because Shogi is a journalist who actually worked for the Washington Post and he went into the Saudi embassy in Turkey to get a marriage license in his Stan bolt to get a marriage license. So for him and his wife and he never got out day killed him, dismembered him, used a bone saw and then they even went as far as to cover it up where they had a body double go in and they gave him a fake beard and they had him wear his clothes and walk out. Is there video of the body?

Speaker 1:          00:46          There is, there is. In fact, CNN had it. I know yesterday I was looking at the CNN video that had it. Um, so yeah, Saudi Arabia now brazenly killing journalists. And I'll tell you what, you came up with a bunch of different versions of the story too. Yeah, but why they did it. Here's the body. There you go. Here's him. And then the guy on the right with hair. Why would they have a guy with hair as a body double? Think about how much this had to be planned out to have a body double. Right? But why did they give the body w bubble? If you're going to be a body, double shave your head dude. The other guy's bald. That's crazy. So they didn't even do a good job at faking their murder, but it's the worst fake ever. Yeah. Cause the guys get a full head of hair. Yeah. It's not great. No, it's terrible. How shoes on too? He had different shoes. Yeah, I mean that's, that's the worst body double. It's got dark hair and they're saying this is the guy. Look, he's fine walking around. No issues. It's a body double knot. A hair double, I guess.

Speaker 1:          01:42          I mean, if you can have a body double shave, the guy's fucking heads tell you walked into a different shirt and everything. Oh, that's a body double. Yeah, so his hair colors different too. I mean, he's got dark hair. This guy's got gray here. The thing that's driving me nuts about this is so now this is getting a lot of press attention and I'm happy it's getting a lot of press attention, of course. But the reason why it is is because he's part of the elite class in the sense that he's a journalist and now you have the people from the New York Times and the Washington Post and CNN and they can relate and they go, oh my God, they're killing journalists. Now this is crazy. Look at the precedent that this sets, but what people don't know is for the past two or three years, Saudi Arabia has been waging a literal genocide in Yemen, and that's not an exaggeration.

Speaker 1:          02:20          So they blockaded the country. They're not allowing in medicine, there's a cholera epidemic happening there. Millions of people are sick. They have people dying of starvation because they're not allowing in food or humanitarian aid. They're bombing hospitals, they're bombing schools, they're bombing open air markets. So they're doing a literal genocide. And that got very little coverage, but then with this journalist now finally starting to get some coverage, but I'm curious what happens moving forward in terms of how will the US respond to it? Because as I'm sure you already know this, I mean they care more about that $110 billion weapons deal that they just had with the Saudis and they do about the lives of humanities or the lives of journalists. Yeah. The, the idea of him being really valuable. It's not, it's not just that he's a part of the elite. It's that there was a conspiracy to do so that they think came from upon high.

Speaker 1:          03:05          Yeah. Right. And there was 15 people that they're saying flew in from Saudi Arabia and one of them was a forensics expert who like knows how to cover up evidence, knows what evidence is, what it feels like a movie. Did. The bone saw things that been confirmed. They know they had a bone saw. I heard that. Now the nickname for him in Washington DC is what they say bone saw a salmon, his name is Mohammad bin Salman. They're calling him bone saw Solomon or something like that. Yeah, dude, it is. The stuff that's going on is just scary to me. And then there's also some interesting geopolitical stuff happening around this. The head of Turkey is now using this as an issue to try to snuggle up to the u s because he's got ambitions where he wants to like recreate the Ottoman Empire. And of course Muhammad Bin Salman, he has ambitions where he wants to dominate the Middle East.

Speaker 1:          03:52          So you have at the same time, this weird ego battle between a Air Diwan and Mohammed bin Salman and they're all trying to suck up to the u s to, you know, basically get it so that, uh, we can, we do favors for them and we allow them to expand. And on top of that, there, the story's changed multiple times. Right? It's the story of what happened five times. First they said nothing happened to them, to him. Then they said, oh, you got out fight and now they're saying that he was killed by people who overstep their bounds. That's right. Yeah. They keep changing the store. And there's also stories that the, the consulate has video and audio evidence of the murder. That's what Turkey saying. Yeah, but they don't want to release it because then people will know how they're spying on them when they visit the consulate.

Speaker 1:          04:39          I guess so I didn't see that, but I'll take your word for it. Yeah. That was to see if you can find that. That was one of the things that was brought up yesterday, that they don't want to release this video and audio evidence because if they do, then other people will know how they're spying on them when they visit. Yeah, I could see that. I mean, they should immediately cut off the arms deal with Saudi Arabia, no more weapons for a regime that's doing the stuff that they're doing. And we already knew that they behead people in the public square for sorcery, sorcery. Do they really? Yes. For witchcraft. You don't to see for drug smuggling that they behead people in the public square for those things.
