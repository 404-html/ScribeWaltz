Speaker 1:          00:00          And, and it's so much fun to do. I love playing the, the straight guy cohost to his fucking insane character. But uh, yeah, we've done these live shows and they're, they're really a lot of fun and he's just a, he's a great guy. Fucking, oh my God, it's so ridiculous. He's got to stay and look at those pants. That is hilarious. Did the places like packed and it's crazy. You guys reading? What are the notes? Oh, he, he wanted us to, he wrote, he wrote like a, almost a play, but it's all just kissing chips ass and how wonderful chip is and how thankful we are going to be there. Like it's so God damn funny. I love it. He's a, he's brilliant man. He's just a great guy and very fucking funny. I knew from the first, I think that also a kind of, I'm not blaming Jimmy or anything, but I think that helped to kind of break up the o and a show in time.

Speaker 1:          01:03          I think opie started resenting the little bit of that comradery that me and Jimmy were having. Um, me and Jimmy kind of slowly started pulling away and doing our own thing like it was, and the humor is, you know, the more twisted the better. I love sick humor. He does too. And we laugh. We did a whole bit on, on like Lacy Peterson and Scott Peterson the murder. Yeah. And you would think like, obviously he murdered his pregnant wife and dumped her in the ocean. What could possibly be funny about that? Well, people wrote tribute songs, uh, with this guy wrote a tribute song to her and it another one of these self centered assholes that thought he was going to go viral by making a attribute. And we started changing the words to the song to make it just horrible involving seaweed and things. So it was terrible.

Speaker 1:          01:52          But me and Jim are literally crying, laughing and all of these just kind of sitting there like not really able to jump in or not kind of getting why we're laughing at this sick shit. Uh, so it kind of pushed us further apart, um, at that point. Yeah. We, we both as people changed over the course of the 20 years we worked together 20 fucking years with any body. Dude is, is nuts. You get a girl at Suck Your Dick Every day for 20 years, you're going to be like, Oh fuck, stop sucking my Dick. But now it's think it's open across from me, you know? Yeah. Uh, so you're going to get on each other's nerves. And I'm not innocent in the whole thing either, but I was, I'm a lot more laid back. Like I, I knew what real work was. I worked for fucking living.

Speaker 1:          02:42          I did heating and air conditioning installation and it was freezing cold in the winter and boiling hot in the summer. And when I got that first gig and radio because of Opie, and I'll always thank him for that. Uh, I knew what it was like to work and I didn't want to fuck that up. So I plastered a smile on my face at every turn and did the show four hours a day. Everyone has someone at work that they don't get along with. You don't leave the whole fucking, you know, you just deal with it. And that's eight hours. I had another 20 hours of the day that didn't involve Greg [inaudible] Hughes so I could deal with it. Uh, he was more like, he had an express himself a little more, which I guess is healthy in a way, but, uh, I didn't need to, so I didn't, I didn't text him.

Speaker 1:          03:29          I didn't call him. I, uh, we got in an argument once and he goes, dude, you never even been to my house. And I go, alright, get everyone from the show in here. Jim, have I ever been to the house? Nope. Travis? No. Sam, no. Iraq. No, I've never been to anyone's house. Let me tell you something right now. Yeah, that's somewhat, chick would say, I know that when my house toad, it's exactly that. Been to my house type of relationship. Does that mean we didn't see even moon? I never been Africa. What the fuck are you saying? I'd never been to Spain. What does that have to do with anything that we've, if you had a problem with me not coming to your house, why didn't you ask me to come to your house? Yeah. Like is there like a, you asking me every day and I'm saying no.

Speaker 1:          04:09          Everyone. I was saying no. Right, right. What's going on it, it was always something like that. And believe me, I'm not going to sit here and shit on the guy. I that my shows for that, uh, I'm not gonna fucking around. Uh, I'm not going to sit on the guy. But there were definitely personality quirks and that, I guess we both had, but there was something like if, if I, I would party all the time and, and you know, I had to be there at 6:00 AM and I'm driving from Roslyn Long Island to New York City. It's, it's 25 30 miles of just fucked traffic every day. He has to get there. It could be 35 minutes. It could be an hour and a half based on if someone's pulled over on the side of the road, some asshole crashes in Queens, whatever it was. It was, uh, it was a shit drive every day and you had to be there at six, right at six o'clock the show started.

Speaker 1:          05:00          And so even at sixth it'd be that kind of traffic. Yeah. Yeah. There's, it wasn't as bad as it got it, like seven or eight, but you never really knew. It could, it could. I was never late late, but there were times I'd come in at five, after eight, after six was pretty much as late as I would, I would be. It was never more than that. But he would go like, he never had to say anything like this music starts, there's a little, uh, bumper at the beginning, and by the time it starts, I, I'd sit down and he and Mike would go, um, well, I guess there was traffic, Anthony just getting in and other bosses are listening. And it was, it just wasn't necessary to do that. You know, it, it kind of, I was like, guys don't do that guys don't do that to each other.

Speaker 1:          05:48          You fucking sit down. Don't say a word. No one would know I'm late. You know? And that's what happened. And it, there were instances like that. All the, it's all in my book, permanently suspended. There's that book out now. It's out now. Borders, border's Barnes and noble. I think we have a copy of the agreement. Ah, yes. Very good. But I talked to my house, it's in my house. I talk a lot about obviously the relationship and, and uh, with opie and, and how it kind of slowly, uh, came apart at the seams, I think toward the end. Uh, he just, it had, if he didn't want to do a show with, with me anymore, I don't think you want to do a show with Jimmy either. That didn't last long. And I knew it wasn't going to last long. They, I was the buffer between the two of them.

Speaker 1:          06:36          That ended bad. It really did. It really did. Uh, if you talked to Jimmy about it, like yeah, yeah, he doesn't, he doesn't express that kind of, no, no. He doesn't like Jimmy's a very loyalty driven guy. Like he takes that very seriously and if he feels somebody fucking with him, he really gets pissed. Uh, usually it can get talked out and everything's cool after a little while. Uh, but this one who follow this, this is pat. I didn't work. Yeah, no, I think honestly the way you guys interacted with each other, what he was good for was sort of directing the whole thing. That's the impression that I got and I mean how many times I do the show dozens, right? Yeah. Yeah. I don't know how many times it did it. Absolutely. But I was felt like what he did really well was like sort of guide things like sit back more, let you guys be funny, but, but guide, like figure out like maybe we need more of this, maybe we need more of that.

Speaker 1:          07:35          And there was real value to that. Absolutely. But do you think that's fun when you go out and do an appearance and everyone's clamoring about a bit that me and Jimmy did or something for handyman. Yeah. And he's sitting there going like, well I, I pushed a button and I drove the ship and I, you know, went to spots and if he knew it's, it's, it's funny cause like, yeah, you're not going to be appreciated as much, but it's like a guy who is good at defense. He doesn't score a lot of points. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're not going to be Lebron James. It's necessary. Guys who score the points though or the ones who everybody wants to talk to. You ever see a, I think of OFI like, um, do you ever see the prestige, the movie, the prestige, uh, with the, the two magicians?

Speaker 1:          08:26          No. [inaudible] it's, it's a good movie. It's a good movie. But at one point, because he has to use a body double, the actual magician has to drop below the stage and the body double comes out and gets all the applause and he's under the stage. The real guy that did the whole act is under the stage and he shuts his eyes and puts his arms out. Like trying to enjoy the adulation from the fans, but it's not even him getting it. And I think that kind of mindset was there. There's, and then resentment starts bubbling up and you start doing things like saying, Anthony just got in, um, you, you hold things over people's heads. The contract negotiations were a nightmare every time. And opie always wanted a one year deal. I'm like, what the fuck are you doing? Let's sign for 10 years. Who gives a shit?

Speaker 1:          09:20          You know, if they want to fire you, they're going to fight anyway, the contract or not, but let's lock them in. So if something happens, at least we have, uh, a settlement portion, we could take half the, the what they owe us for five years, whatever it is, not one year deal. That's all I want. Because he always had this delusion of grandeur. Like there was always something better waiting, uh, for us to grab up. And it's like the truth of the matter was, the glory years of the ONA show were gone. The New Year's and the, you know, all that crazy fucking radio. We were damaged goods after the sex in Saint Patrick's cathedral debacle.
