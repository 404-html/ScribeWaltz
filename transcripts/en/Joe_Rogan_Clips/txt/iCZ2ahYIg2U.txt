Speaker 1:          00:00          I think that it's um, give me some advice. I don't know enough about it. I'm an idiot. I just on anything on anything money related cause you have an icon jeep so I know you have more money. I just work a lot. We'll such grandfather leaves. That's true. That's the shit. My grandfather, I'm not a big, I'm not a big investor. I'm not very smart. I got you. I have people handling that kind of stuff, which you don't work a lot but I don't pay attention to anything guilty now. Yeah. I do too many things myself to the place where I know exactly what I have to pay attention to them. What I don't want, I don't have to pay attention to is just gone shot. Robert Paul lay my accountant has made it pretty easy for me. He is literally a graph. This is a dollar you make.

Speaker 1:          00:39          This is what goes into savings. This is what goes into advancement. This is what you and Shay weren't invested in real estate. This is for retirement. So now everything that comes in and I already know. So it's like when they call us until like, hey you guys, you guys got a $500,000 a day. I just know that I'm not going home with two 50 because asset management conditions, my wife and my accounting already chop that shit up. So I got enough money to buy a Camaro. Yeah, I don't like to think about that. I had just to think about now cause you know I'm black and you know shit, I ain't been too good if you like, but it got my live view poor and black. If you pour America's fucked up. Yeah. If you pour in black Americans, fuck that with a deal during ass.

Speaker 1:          01:19          So you know, my whole shit is, let me take care of my money because my grandpa and my grandmother, her family owned land, they started as sharecroppers, but because they are land she could, she could become educated because they could sail the stuff. They grew to stores and produce markets and stuff. So she named were Methodist. So she got to go to school. My grandfather, some other old no land. So my grandfather had to work in a bread factory in cotton meals and shit. So I knew the difference between ownership and you know, the advantages of having something in it. So it's something I can have obsessed on because I don't want my children to endure poverty. And I, and I grew up working class, you know, my wife, she jokes, but she said to the lot, you know, she was from housing projects in Savannah and her grandmother and her mother worked.

Speaker 1:          02:06          They were out of there. But you know, she says to me, me all the time, you were spoiled. You know, you're a little rich kids. I'm like, what are you talking about? She's like, you had a fucking RV. I'm like, I lived in an a frame house. She's like, I don't care. Your Grandpa, your grandparents couldn't afford a RV. You guys went on vacation. You were spoiled. Right? So I understand money means a lot, and it doesn't mean everything to me, but it helps to afford me to be able to take care of her. My children, I completely understand it, but I don't really give a shit. Knock on a daily basis. I'm more like you, I just you, but you think about businesses, you think about starting businesses and forming businesses. How do you have the time to do that and write and perform and all the other shit that you do?

Speaker 1:          02:43          Because it enabled the business is enabled me to enjoy writing. They're performing. When I had to wrap, when it was no choice, um, it, it wasn't as fun anymore because the pressure was, am I going to chart, can I make this much? Will the record versus, you know, if I have a couple of shaves in revenue coming in, you know, it, it makes it a little more relaxed and my art is freer that way, you know? Ooh, I like that answer. That's a great answer. That makes sense. That makes a lot of sense actually. Yeah. To free yourself up creatively so that all you have to think about when you're doing that, you're just doing what you want to do. Yeah. That's it. Yeah. That's it. Yeah, man, that's ideal. That's wise. That's the goal. Yeah. If I'm a, you know, a lot of people talk a lot of shit about billionaires they like and they want to be, and then Daryl, there are tons of billionaires from the nerdy sexy or Bill Gates to the wild, dope, eccentric, sexy of Eli Musk to the ogs of Warren Buffett and shit.

Speaker 1:          03:39          I like Ted Turner, Ted Turner as well. Ted was the guy who got nine, got snookered out of six, ended up with one or two and it's like, man, I'm living in my fucking life growing bice and eating good meat. Where's the fucking cowboy hat with my funky mustache? And like he's, he was such a good owner of teams and our city, when he owned the teams, he was a great man with TBS and he did a lot of good. He's, if you know, if I, if, if, if a billion is the new style, I want to be a billionaire, but of having a lot of money's a standard, I'd like to be the quirky, eccentric guy. Like Ted, he always seemed free to me. Yeah. Especially once you got rid of Jane Fonda that shouts out to listen. When he married Jane Fonda the south, where we literally thought it was, oh man, it was like the city of Atlanta had went back to gone with the wind.

Speaker 1:          04:25          It was just amazing. Again, it was, people were strutting around that, you know Jane Fonda's virtual, our first lady, well you know, if he will start to, but I choose a nice lady to the city. David Justice and highly Barry were interesting too. Not an interest in is to some bastard. He was hands one motherfucking the world. Was it? What's the, um, what's the yachting if anyone, I don't know, the Yada he who's, he got into Yachty and out of nowhere because cup the America's cup was it, was that right? Yeah. Ted Turner lived a life that Ralph Lauren puts on tee shirts.

Speaker 1:          05:00          Yeah. He looks like a, like a billionaire and a movie too. He does great Gatsby tie. He does. He does some guy who's a wise billionaire. It brings you into this study and you have a scotch with him on ice. Exactly. Explain Shit to you. And you're like, what in the fuck? Shouts out to tay it man. I know you don't get your love like a lot of the other guys. The cut, he does the fucking Montana ground bison. He's out there chilling man. We bound it. The population of Bison so he could cook them and eat them. It's like get the fuck out of here. That's bad ass man. But those overalls, respect. That's how my fucking grandfather dressed with the same mustache. That's what I want to be like when I think about making 21 million escaping the game and shit. This is me like maybe overalls in a Braves cap, but this is it. Now let me ask you this, how far away from him are dudes with machine guns at all times, but he's in fucking Montana but so what? I can drive to Montana stick. He'll take turn tenant who wants to come in? No one wants to kill Turner. She get some money, Bro. No one wants to kill. I would imagine she has two snipers. He probably has. He probably has two snipers say east and west, and he has one guy within a few feet of him, but very relaxed. I don't think teds walking around like Kadafi.
