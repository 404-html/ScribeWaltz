Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience,

Speaker 2:          00:02          kind of weird how they cited some of those same parts of the code of conduct where, Oh yes, every employee should do their utmost of reducing bias and harassment and illegal discrimination. When really my document was about illuminating the bias against conservatives and the harassment against them and the legal discrimination that we're doing in multiple parts of our pipeline.

Speaker 1:          00:26          There's no room for conservatives today, sir. I mean I'm uh, you conservative. Do you feel like,

Speaker 2:          00:33          because I, I'm pretty much just libertarian but that's thought of as conservative cause it's convenient. Right. You just immediately pushed off that right wing, angry white male group. Yeah. Everyone that's in the center or right of that is all right. All right. Yeah. You favor of smaller government, less intrusion. Yeah. I, I'm not super libertarian. Like I obviously believe that there's places where the government should be, but just I do my, yeah, my like internal leaning or in philosophy is more like that.

Speaker 1:          01:08          Yeah. I think socially I lean more left like socially, like in terms of like welfare and things along those lines. And you know, obviously this, um, protected status is driving me crazy. This, this thing that Trump's doing with, um, uh, children that were born in this country are born in other countries and then brought over here as children and then they're talking about deporting them. That drives me fucking crazy. That kind of the hard right version of that is despicable. This, these people that I see online, like why didn't they apply for citizenship? Oh, who knows? Maybe because they're fucking 13. You know, like you out there applying for citizenship if you were 13. No, I mean, when you're 13 years old, you're playing games and hanging out with your friends and then you find out you were born in Guatemala and you're like, what?

Speaker 1:          01:51          I'm like, you have to go back to Guatemala. What? Yeah, it's crazy. I lean way left when it comes to those kinds of things. Gay Rights and things like, um, you know, a social programs for disenfranchised people and disenfranchise communities. I W I lean way, like if I want my tax dollars to go to anything, I want it to go to making people's lives easier, whether it's socialized medicine or whatever. Whatever we could do to make people like have an easier path to success and to not have them so burdened down by their environment and their circumstances. That I think is like our responsibility as human beings to try to, I don't want to say even the playing field because there's never going to be an even playing field, but to give people opportunity, that's it. Just give people an opportunity to do well and not have it so completely stacked against them.

Speaker 1:          02:42          So in that sense, I'm not very conservative in that way. Like I'm not one of those pull yourself up by your bootstraps thing because that's just, that's so delusional. Like some people are just fucked, you know, they, you know, they, they're born with a terrible hand and it would be nice if more of us were charitable that regard, you know? And some people think that that charity should be a personal issue and that we should all just do it. You know, as part of our community and our society, maybe that's a good argument and, but maybe the argument is that our government should be a part of our community, you know, and that we should think about it that way. Instead of thinking of it as, as, as this overlord that decides and designates where our money should go, then maybe we should have some more say in it. It should be some sort of a, a more, uh, you know, just, just a, a more, uh, more kind approach. So in that sense, I leaned pretty far left, but I'm also pretty pragmatic, you know, and I, and I also know that if you give people too much, it's like sort of that winning lottery ticket thing or that

Speaker 3:          03:45          you know, that

Speaker 2:          03:47          if you, if you make things too easy for people, they don't try hard. It's just a natural part of human nature. So in that sense, some conservative and a lot of ways, yeah, you definitely need some sort of safety net and to ensure that people can actually achieve the American dream.

Speaker 1:          04:04          I'm like, I'm, I've been bleeding more and more towards universal basic income than anything. I think universal basic income at a certain point that look good enough that you can just eat and survive and then maybe that would open up a lot more people to pursuing dreams to going after things. I mean, I don't, I don't know. I mean there's arguments for and against

Speaker 2:          04:23          and I think it's debatable. It'll be interesting to see, you know, Finland I think was proposing start this because we don't really know what will happen. Right. And maybe people will start doing their hobbies and really find their passion. Maybe they'll just sit at home and watch TV and die. Yeah. I, it's really, these are the problems that we as a society we'll have to overcome. And of course these are just first world problems, but that's, that will be what the world is like. There was another country today. I read about it on Google, uh, another country today that's considering a universal basic income, but fucking, what was it? South Korea.

Speaker 3:          05:05          Oh really? Um,

Speaker 2:          05:08          see if he could find it. It's, it's Scotland. Is that what it was?

Speaker 3:          05:15          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          05:16          Um, I think there's many, many people that are, I mean, Elon Musk has been promoting this lately. Scotland will be game funding, universal basic income experiments. Yeah. Hawaii. That's what it was. Hawaii considers universal basic income as robot scene, stealing jobs, fucking robots running around the streets, stealing jobs. Yeah. It's Hawaii. Um, I think there is some real arguments to be made and I think, um, Elon Musk, who is of course a part of this automated, uh, car revolution and he's, uh, he's creating these, these trucks that they're gonna start using to haul things and they're going to be, and it's going to remove a lot of jobs and they're, they're starting to talk about universal basic income is, you know, a real solution to that. I mean, it's entirely possible. It's, it's certainly an argument, you know, it's certainly worth discussing.

Speaker 2:          06:11          Yeah. Something like that. And hopefully the incentives will be better than some of the current welfare systems where, you know, you're not incentivize to get off of it. Yeah. If you start working, then you'll lose all of it while universal basic income can be made such that you start working on, then you'll lose a little bit. But it's never an actual incentive to not work. Yes. Right. It's not an incentive to not work, but it's an, it's a

Speaker 1:          06:39          gives you food and shelter. Right. So then you could go pursue a dream, which I think it would be wonderful. I mean, look, if there's anything that our tax dollars should be going towards, it's creating less losers, right? Less people feel disenfranchised by the system. You know, if you're, if you're, if you can pay x amount of tax dollars, but live in an exponentially more safe and friendly and happy environment, I think most people would be leaning towards that. I think it would.

Speaker 2:          07:06          Yeah. Yeah. I mean, and we'll see this, we see it too. And um, people that start companies where it's a huge risk to start a company. Most people fail. And most entrepreneurs in silicon valley are men who are much more, uh, willing to take risks. But if we do have some sort of strong safety net, then it won't be so bad if you fail, and maybe that'll help address some of the gender gap too. That's interesting.

Speaker 4:          07:39          [inaudible] okay.
