Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches, intelligent conversation about that, right? Because the lefties say, oh, too much inequality and they need to be listened to because the evidence is quite clear. If you let the inequality ramp up enough, the whole system destabilizes because the people at the bottom think fuck it. We'll just, we'll just flip the system upside down. No one wants that. Like right wing conservatives don't want that. So cause you could make a republican argument and say, don't let the inequality in your neighborhood get out of hand because the crime rate will skyrocket. And the, the empirical evidence on that is overwhelmingly strong. Inequality drives crime. Now you can say, you can argue about why, but the fact that it does is that's not disputable. So we can have an intelligent discussion between the left and the right and the discussion would go something like this.

Speaker 1:          00:45          You need innovation, you pay for innovation with inequality, but you need to bind inequality because if it's too intense than things destabilize, it's like, okay, we can agree on that. We've got the parameter set. Now we have to, now we have to start thinking very carefully through how to do the redistribution issue. And we don't know how to do that. So you might say, well, we have a guaranteed annual income for people, which I think is a horrible solution by the way, but it addresses the right problem. The problem is is that we're hyper productive, but the spoils go to those at the top. And some of those resources need to be funneled down to the people who have zero so that they have an opportunity to at least get to the point where they can innovate. And so the bloody whole bloody thing doesn't wobble and fall.

Speaker 1:          01:25          And we could we, and I would say in some sense that's what the political discussion is about. But we, we've, we've skittered off into these radical oversimplifications, which is something like, well, if, if you have more than another person, you're an oppressor and you're evil, and if you have less, it's because you're virtuous and victimized. And that's just a nonstarter. So you you think that there's a real problem with like something like a universal basic income? I think it's horrible. I do. Well. I think the idea that the solution is a basic income is not a good idea because I think the problem is deeper than that. I, I don't think the fundamental problem is that people don't have enough money. I think the fundamental problem is that human beings in some sense are beasts of burden and if they're not given, if they're not provided with a place where they can accept social responsibility, social and individual responsibility and an honorable manner, they degenerate and die.

Speaker 1:          02:17          That's the opiate crisis in west right now. Like men need men who are, men don't need money, they need function and we've got a problem. One of the problems is, for example here, here's an ugly stat. I think I told you this once before. It's illegal to induct anyone into the armed forces if they have an Iq of less than 83 and the reason for that is the, the, the armed forces, despite having every reason to draw the contradictory conclusion has decided that there isn't a single thing that you can be trained to do in the military. If you have an Iq of less than 83 that isn't positively counterproductive, that's 10% of the population and we're producing a culture that's

Speaker 2:          03:00          very cognitively complex like, what the hell are you going to do if you can't use a computer? Like if you can use a computer, you're at least in the game if you can really use when you're hyper powerful. If you're not literate enough to use a computer, you're at zero 10% of the population. The Conservatives say, well, there's a job for everyone. If they just worked hard enough. It's like, no, and increasingly know and the liberals say, well, everyone's basically the same and you can train anyone to do anything. It's like, no, you can't. I want to go back to the inequality point here because if you look at this biologically, actually I think it reveals a lot. Why are we, I mean, we know from, uh, from careful study that people are motivated by the degree of inequality more than they are the, the absolute level of wellbeing that they have.

Speaker 2:          03:50          And there's a very good, it's tragic, but a very good evolutionary reason for this, which is if you are working on some piece of land and your neighbor has the adjacent piece of land and they're doing twice as well as you, it's because they know something you don't, right. And so becoming focused on what they're doing that you're not doing is a rational thing to spend your time on. So you can figure out what it is that they know that you don't. In the modern environment, this is a catastrophe because who are your neighbors? Well, you've got some box sitting on the wall of your living room that has a totally artificial portrait of other people who may be much wealthier than you. And it's broadcasting in as if you're looking in their window right in the adjacent house. And so you think you, you're being triggered to, to think that you're doing something wrong, that you might fix when in fact the solution may not be, first of all, the person on the other side of that screen may not be for real.

Speaker 2:          04:44          Um, but even if they are, they're not living in the same environment as you. The technology is interfacing with, uh, with our, our brains badly. But so we have the perception of massive inequality economically. We do have massive inequality. You're arguing that the solution to this involves some sort of massive redistribution as solution, I would say solution. But nonetheless, redistribution is wildly unpopular for various reasons. And so what we've got now is a situation, this is speculative, but what's really happening is that austerity is being used as a threat to keep people who would otherwise rebel against the inequality in line. And my fear about this is that this is exactly the conditions that are going to trigger that, uh, tribal population against population may hem that we were talking about at the beginning of this conversation that when people have the sense that the, the burst of growth that they were experiencing is now over, the natural response is to turn on those who are not as powerful and take their stuff. That this is a totally indefensible but nonetheless biological

Speaker 1:          05:58          pattern of history. And that if we want to avoid that, we have to stop sending the signals that trigger us to imagine that we've just run to the limit of the opportunity that we had discovered. And it is now time to look and see who can't defend their position. How are we sending these signals? Well by, um, basically failing to provide enough wellbeing that people's perception of the inequality is reduced to a tolerable level. What's the argument for universal basic income? It's certainly certainly a strong one. And I, you know, it's also, it's also a good argument for equality of opportunity, right? Because people are, people are actually not as resentful about the success of others as you might expect. They're resentful about it if they feel that the game is fixed, but they're also willing to consider the game long term. So lots of people will say, look like I'm stuck at not zero, I'm stuck at one, but my kids might make it to four and that's good enough.

Speaker 1:          06:57          And that's been the American dream. Right? And, and that's, that's a really high power antidote to inequality. It's like, well yeah, there's some inequality. We need it to keep the generative mechanism going, but the game is fair and you can play it too. And there's some reasonable probability that either you or someone you love will be successful. So that, so it has to be a straight game. And that's why ethics is so important to keep this landscape stable. People can't play crooked games and the rich shouldn't be fixing the game if they want to hold onto their money. And the problem is, is that some of them, although not all, some of them are fixing the game and no one's happy about that. And no wonder, you know, and, and I guess that was evidence to some degree by the 2008 collapse because it seemed, and, and I'm just as uninformed as the next person.

Speaker 1:          07:46          So I'm, I'm what I'm capable of commenting on this, it seems from the outside that the rich disproportionately benefited from the restabilize [inaudible] of the economic system. And people are not happy about that and they shouldn't be happy about that because it indicates that there's something fundamentally rotten about the game. So you could say, well, maybe people can tolerate necessary inequality if the game isn't raked. And so that's why everybody has to act in a matter that indicates that the game isn't rigged. And that means they can't rig it. That's really what it means. So, and so we're also being driven into this inequality corner by, I would say by the postmodernists and the neo Marxist because they say this is the pernicious thing. They say, well, the reason that some people have more than others is because every hierarchy is based on arbitrary power and they're all oppressors. And the reason they have the money is because they stole it from you. And there's some truth in that because there are some criminals. But when you get to the point where you fail to distinguish the productive people from the criminals, which is exactly what happened in the 1920s in the Soviet Union, you better bloody well what watch out. Because when you radically make things,

Speaker 2:          08:56          egalitarianism going to wipe out all your productive people and then you're going to starve. And so that's, that's one of the doom end scenarios that awaits us if this idiot process of polarization continues. And what I find reprehensible about the universities, and you're tangled up right up to your neck in this, is that the universities are actively agitating to produce people who believe that all inequality is due to oppression and power. And that's just, well, first of all, it's technically wrong, but you guys both operate in that system. So what? Here's the problem. No, I, as far as I know, nobody has properly studied the question of what fraction of the economy is actually crooked rent seeking, right? Not Productive. And I fear that the answer to that question is that it's an awful large fraction of the economy, not because of some, uh, conspiracy, but because opportunity is finite, but con Games aren't.

Speaker 2:          10:00          And so anybody who can find a mechanism for transferring wealth from somebody else for doing nothing, finds that mechanism and that thing is, is ever present. Whereas discovering the next big thing that's actually productive is, you know, something that goes along in fits and starts. And so if we were, I mean really, you've described it very well. We've got a battle between two characatures of what's true, right? Are there either the market is wonderful and it's producing great stuff with very little corruption or everything that makes people on equal is the result of corruption. Both of these things are wrong, right? Markets are marvelous engines for figuring out how to do something really well. They're brilliant at this, right? And so people who see that fall in love with it, understandably because they're so good at it, but what they're terrible at is telling you what you should want or what you should do, right?

Speaker 2:          10:55          If people tell markets, here's what we would like to accomplish, and then the markets tell us, well, how do we accomplish that best? That would be a very viable system that would not result in massive rent seeking, resulting in everybody feeling that all of their misfortunes are the result of a rigged game, which is so massively rigged that when they check, they see, yes, that is actually large, large to large extent what we're suffering from. Um, but they want to throw the baby out with the bath water. And so they want to throw out markets entirely, which you know, would be a terrible mistake.
