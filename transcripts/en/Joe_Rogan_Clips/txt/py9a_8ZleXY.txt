Speaker 1:          00:00          And, and as much as we're talking about wrestling, he impressed me. Stand up. Oh yeah. He cracked Condamine right hand. He, he, he's, he stood up enough to just say, you know, I'm going to sit here and take a few and I'm going to give a few. But then he went to probably what his game plan was, I would assume. Well, you have to stand for a little while because if you just shoots it and he'll get caught with a knee or caught with a punch rushing in. But uh, he, I mean, he landed the bigger shot. There was one big giant shot that was landed in that fight and it was by hand and Conner hit him with some pretty good front kicks to the body and some other things, but it didn't really get much off on the feet, not like classic left Jabs that just break people down and on the ground he just got mall.

Speaker 1:          00:46          And it's one of those things where you see that guy in the beginning, guys fight him off a little bit and then as the fight, whereas on he just gets more and more dominant. They get more and more exhausted. Really. This fight just makes ally Quinta look like a God. I mean that's the most impressive thing about it. Ally Quinten went five rounds with him, stood toe to toe with him and you know, gave him at least a struggle. At least he gave him a bit of adversity, you know, managed to survive on the ground much better than Conor did. Manage to get back up to his feet, manage this stuff. A bunch of take downs and on the feet was a real threat. You know what I mean? Obviously could be, didn't prepare for ally quintile. He prepared for Connor. But ally acquainted didn't even prepare for five rounds.

Speaker 1:          01:30          The only prepared for three. So there was so much to that fight. What do you think will happen with Conner now? I'm worried what happens with Khabib. Yeah, I hope they sit everybody down and they'd go, look, everybody's all right. Come on. You know the guy who rushed in the cage and punched Connor in the face, that guy, that guy should be in the most trouble cause you know, the guy just fought four rounds. Got The fuck beaten out of them. Got Choked. I heard a lot of people, there's a lot of silly non experts out there saying that that wasn't a choke or that wasn't a neck crank. They don't know what the fuck they're talking about. That that is absolutely a neck crank when someone gets their arm around your head like that. And then what they do is they grab it like this and they pinch the elbow.

Speaker 1:          02:21          They put the forearm on his back like this. So as the arm is across the neck and then they grip it like this and the forearm goes into the back and as you're pulling like this, you're pushing with your forum and Yanking with your hand is a terrible neck crank. Um, they call dean lister actually has a video on it. It's, he calls it the fulcrum choke and it's a nasty choke. So you know, I thought he was going under the neck here. You can see it here. Dean lister, who's a world champion, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt and a, that's my friend Hans. Hans Molin camp behind them and watch how he does it. See how he's, he's grabbing a hold of it and what he's going to do is he's going to clamp his hands. Cle grips his hands, and so it crushes. He's doing it like this.

Speaker 1:          03:08          No, no, no. You can go right over your face. He can go over your neck and go over your face and go over your fucking cheekbones. It doesn't matter. It doesn't even have to go under the chin. If it goes on the chin, that's awesome, but you see what's going on with his forearm. See how he's put push, pull into with his arms or you could do it some. Some guys do it like this, but I think this is probably the best way to do it, but as you're right here, this part just digs that elbow. Yeah, perfect. Perfect example. See he's pulling on it with his, his right arm and then his left arm is pushing down with his forearm on Connor shoulder. It is a nasty, nasty net crank and you, your, your head is getting popped off and first of all, that guy could squeeze the shit out of you.

Speaker 1:          03:51          All you have to do. There's a bunch of guys who could put you to sleep like that. Marcello Garcia is one. He puts guys a cease put guys to sleep without even getting under the chin. He just gets your head. Just get your head in there and squeezes. Eddie Bravo can do that too. If he gets your head in there, you don't even have to, it doesn't even have to be under the chin. He just really puts you to sleep with your own fucking head. Just wraps it around your head and squeezes. It's so tight that no blood is getting to your brain. Yeah. So there's a lot of armchair quarterbacks out there saying that that was a neck crank. You are incorrect and a have deanlets to do that shit to you and you will know Jocko do that to me. My throat is still, you don't want it.
