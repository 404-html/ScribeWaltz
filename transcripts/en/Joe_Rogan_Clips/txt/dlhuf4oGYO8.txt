Speaker 1:          00:00          The plants themselves. Yeah, it's all, it's all very strange, man. There's no way out man. There's no way out of this. But in their eyes even there was no way out. It's the out. It's the path of least pain and suffering. And I would tell those folks, I respect the shit out of that and I'm trying to do, I'm trying to take my own this into my own hands and actively in a more tangible way. Your hands off I'm hands on is the way that I would say that and I respect the hands off. I respect like that. I'm cognizant of what's happening here and I'm trying to make it better. I respect that. I, I feel what you saying and I see what you're trying to do. But if I'm thinking through the eyes of a Vegan, you can go fuck yourself.

Speaker 1:          00:42          I'm being the nice guy and you're in a dick like vegans. A lot of them are dicks cause wiling and eating animals. You're killing animals. He fucking asshole. You think you got a free pass? Just kill animals and time you bond. You don't, some of them. So I liked this devil's advocate side of new Joe. Thank you. Did you see Moby ever? Look at Moby's page. Never helped. It's a wonderful Instagram page and everything be something that was so preposterous the other day. And uh, I read the comments under it. I was like, this is so hilarious about eggs and uh, this is what it's, I mean, first of all folks, you kind of talking to a person who has chickens, eggs are like the most Karma free thing says eggs cannot legally be labeled as healthy, nutritious, or safe to eat. First of all, this is true because the eggs are full of cholesterol and saturated fat.

Speaker 1:          01:33          And because every year over a hundred thousand people in the u s contract, Salmonella from eggs, they cannot legally be advertised as healthier, safer, nutritious. Okay? First of all, this central, okay, I dunno why you posted that Moby. You didn't look into it. Is there something called add vault at animal equality? How many people get Salmonella from eggs every year? Because if it was 100,000, the fuck that shouldn't be in the news, Bro would collapse. So God damn fast, so let's dismantle. Please go ahead and do that. Does dismantle this preposterous idea that 100,000 people get Salmonella. Okay, here we go. Even with safety steps in place, it is estimated that about one in 20,000 or one in 10,000 eggs are contaminated with Salmonella. Wow, that's a lot is movie, right? What does he, what did he say? 100,000 people get it right, but we see if you could find how many people in the u s contract Salmonella, because if they find out that this salmonella in eggs, are they finding out that's from uncooked eggs every year, about a million people get Salmonella infected from foods that had been contaminated by one of the many kinds of Salmonella.

Speaker 1:          02:50          Is he right? Okay. Let's, let's see if it's 100,000 people from egs, how many people per year get salmonella from eggs? Where does it say Salmonella in the United States? 142,000 people in the United States are infected each year with Salmonella. Whoa. Hold on. That says from chicken eggs. Wait a minute. 142,000 people in the United States are infected each year with salmonella from chicken, eggs, and about 30 die dude. Not only is Mobi Mobi, right, but he's off by 42,000 now you're going to be way more of a devil's advocate. I'm going gonna hit you hard with this stills out. Let's go on. What'd you do? Have any egg, egg related kind of salmonellosis. That's what gives what it is when you get it. So we found that this is true thousand. Yup. Not only is it true, it's from 2010 maybe it's different. In 2018 142,000 people in United States are infected each year with Salmonella and enter itis cinder.

Speaker 1:          03:57          I end or Itus and Titus and writers from chicken eggs and about 30 die. So he lost 30 pussies in 2010. And analysis of death certificate, joking, joking. It's just a joke. How many podcasts we're in. The comedy section of Itunes, uh, identified 1,316 salmonella related deaths from 1990 to 2006. Whoa. Whoa. Now, thanks for [inaudible]. But this is a problem. These fucking dummies are eating them raw. This is what I want you to Google. How nutritious our eggs. How about Google this? Because a lot of ways, situational fucking life, I've never gotten salmonella were pretty good. You look great. You're doing fine. By the way, if you eat chicken raw, you get Salmonella to stupid. You're not supposed to eat it raw. I supposed to cook it. Okay. One egg has only 75 calories, but seven grams of high quality protein, five grams of fat and 1.6 grams of saturated fat along with iron, vitamins, minerals, and Kara carotinoids.

Speaker 1:          04:53          The AG is a powerhouse of disease fighting nutrients like Lutein and Zeaxanthin. Okay, movie, so shut the fuck up. They're super, super nutritious for you. Just occasional back off Moby. Somebody gets Salmonella. How about just cook your fucking fucking eggs, but here's where it gets really dark. Why don't you Google this? How many people die every year from Ecolab? From vegetables. That's right, cause a shitload anti corn is actually from farmed animals. That's actually from agricultural runoff from the, let's Google, how much methane comes from how much methane comes from vegans, Broccoli. It's dead. Like hell. Yeah. Let's come back to this. Like where do you play the Wii? And it's fun. Just love him. He's so right. He's not just writing. He's, he's more than 40,000. [inaudible] Moby please. Uh, just six degrees of Mobi. Edit your post with the correct number. Write about like eggs or dangerous bro.

Speaker 1:          05:52          Don't eat them wrong, like good diet. Don't eat them raw. Stupid. Okay, here it goes. CDC estimates 260 out. Wow. 265,000 infections occur each year in the United States of ECO lie. Wow. 36% are caused by e Cola. Zero one five or 7.87. Dude, it's almost all from animal agriculture is almost all from uh, from Shit, from Shit. Water types of Ecolab can cross islands can be transmitted through contaminated water or food to contract with the animals where people, yeah, but when they say contaminated water, what they really mean is that water's contaminated with shit from animal agriculture. I think almost entirely. What is the timeline? The source of Eco Lie? The Google this most prominent source of eco lie from in vegetables. I would guarantee you it's um, animal agriculture. I mean, if you see those gigantic factory farms, the runoff and most prominent source of Nikolai and vegetables, is that what you said?

Speaker 1:          06:53          Because you're better at this than maybe you just need to figure it out. Get it, Joe. You find it, you find the evidence. I'm trying to be, I'm trying to be a can mobi. Yeah. I'm trying to be a Vegan. I'm not arguing for the vegans. Vegans, I like this. I like this. It's not hard to do. It's hard to do it. It's a respectable position, man. It just is. It's all three actually. Was this most prominent, the thing that popped up as the most common way to acquire you eye infections can be pasteurized milk, fresh produce. And that fresh produce means not cooked. So if you get Broccoli, spinach, you're supposed to cook spinach, celery, and that's a problem with Romaine lettuce, right? Because Romaine is, nobody ever cooks that stupid fucking shit. I fuck the world had no Romaine lettuce. Do you think you'd be okay? I think it'd be fine. Dining calls it the hard lettuce. He's like, I don't want that hard. Let us give me the soft. Oh, I don't like giving the soft lettuce iceberg is just a joke. That's just room for meat. I could be putting meat in my stomach instead of that shitty ass. It's just delicious. And the lettuce. Yeah. Listen, I should say.
