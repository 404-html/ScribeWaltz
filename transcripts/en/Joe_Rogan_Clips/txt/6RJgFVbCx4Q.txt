Speaker 1:          00:00          Right. Right. But, uh, but let's talk about clicks. One of the things we talked about the other day, his traffic assignment, so I know you asked me this, they're fighting for their lives. It's a serious issue, but I just like to point out their lives never existed in the media space. Please explain that because that was one of the more, most illuminating aspects of our conversation on the phone. Yeah. Um, it's, it's publicly known, but not talked about a whole lot that these media organizations, mostly these digital news startups don't actually get a lot of use. So what they do is, it's called a traffic assignment. There's a company called comscore that tracks the, the, the viewership that unique views these sites have. If you're trying to attract investment and you say we get 20 million views per month, they're going to say, that's cool, but this site gets 60.

Speaker 1:          00:42          What do they do? Well, there are some sites, this is according to variety, modern farmer.com. What? What does that, I have, I have no idea. I've never heard of it. But there are many sites which you've probably seen where it's like the top 25 celebrities who you know, mess up their makeup. Yes. You click the page and I'll show you a photo. In order to see the next photo, you got to click the next page. That's that way they turn you one person at 25 unique views are 25 years. I don't want to say unique then accompany like vice for instance, we'll buy the assignment of your traffic and attributed to themselves. So when the comscore numbers come out it will say all of those views from those clickbait sites are actually vice. Right. That's fucking crazy. And so there was a controversy a bit, again, I'm quoting variety here, I don't want to get sued, but variety said that their traffic went down 17% because someone they were buying traffic assignment from was like going through turmoil and shake and being checked, shaken up.

Speaker 1:          01:39          And another one of their traffic, Simon partners switched to, I think like, you know, it got sold to NBC or something. So. So what ends up happening? Well, I can say, um, a little bit. There was a company that, uh, was a prominent digital news outlet. I knew someone there who was, um, decently high up who told me our company is contemplating whether or not we should engage in traffic assignments to inflate our numbers. And I said, don't do it. Like, that's wrong. And they said, but we need investment. So I wonder if is that fraud? Yes. But if comscore is, is just lumping the numbers together and I go to you and say, according to comscore, our network brings in 60 million. I didn't lie. That's all true. Yes, that's true. So here's what happens. These companies get massive investment. They don't actually generate enough clicks or enough money.

Speaker 1:          02:32          Then once the investment runs out, those jobs never existed. Those were, those were padded by investors. So God, that squirrely, everything collapses. It seems like fraud. I mean it does to me. Yeah. That seems like if that was, if you were doing that with, uh, some tech stock. Yup. Yeah. Right? Yep. Yeah. Musically or something like that. You know, uh, I was told by another individual was headed one of these digital companies that he felt like what we were seeing was akin to the securities, uh, problem. The expense that a mortgage back securities from designate it. If that's a better analogy. That's what he said. He said, I'm thinking about this. You've had all of these big companies, these big investment, hundreds of millions of dollars, $200 million investment into these digital media outlets because they're seeing these numbers. But underneath there's nothing there. And it's crazy. So if you're investing money, so if you've got some, some cash, you've worked your ass off and you've generated a lot of money and you're like, look, we're going to get into the digital space.

Speaker 1:          03:31          We have a website that has 90 million clicks and we're going to take that. And then you find out you just got fucking host. How has that, not fraud because buyer beware? Well, because there's laws that legalized fraud. You know, here's, here's the thing, right? I use a lot. Is it a law? But it, look, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's an interesting loophole. It's not fraud. Because they didn't lie to you, they didn't deceive you. You had every opportunity to look at those numbers and see where they came from, to understand what their network was. Okay, well that may be the case, but the act of doing it, the act of the fact that you can do it and really you're getting monitored. It's fucking crazy shady. But I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else. Something else too. And I, and I say this with the utmost respect for, for Shane Smith who, um, you know, I worked at vice, we've gone out for drinks.

Speaker 1:          04:15          They flew me out. I love Shane. He's a cool dude, but he's brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. He is, he is a master of, uh, I don't know what you disco w we would call it, but it's a form, uh, you know, so I grew up with a bunch of hacker buddies and it in a small little hacker community and social engineering. It's something that I've been, you know, relatively well versed in. And Shane, whether he knows it or not really, really understands how people think and how to get them to do things. So I'll give you a fat, fat. A fascinating example. I left device in 2014 and after I left, some of the people I had had brought on through recommendation were still there. This buddy of mine says, dude, good news. I'm going to be running. I'm going to be helping produce the news program for the cable channel.

Speaker 1:          04:57          I was like, wow, congratulations. Does that mean you're moving to Toronto? He goes, why would I move to Toronto and I was like to work on the cable channel. This is back in 2014 he goes, we talking about we're getting a cable channel. I'm going to work on the new show, and I was like, dude, it was a Rogers deal. The cable channels in Canada. It wasn't a couple of years later. So they got the u s based channel. But what happened was a bunch of my friends who worked at vice didn't know the cable channel they got was based in Canada, but they believed they were going to be working on a cable channel in the u s that's important because you need people to really want to work there and be passionate. And Shane was a master of giving you just enough information so that you believed in what you were doing without realizing it's actually not that great.

Speaker 1:          05:37          And I've got, I'm not trying to be Dick, I think Shane's fantastic. I don't blame him for this, but it's clever. You get a bunch of employees who believe they're going to be on this big new American cable channel. Well, she never said American. He just had cable channel. It's your fault for assuming it was going to be an America, but that meant a lot to those employees. So you're able to boost the morale, get everybody really excited until they find out was in Canada. And then they were like, wait, what? What? Eventually they did. They did get their US channel. But that's, you know, Shane's, he's brilliant. He really is. He's a, he's, you ever play civilization? The video game? No, it's fantastic. I love this game. I'm playing civ six right now and, and you can get, they're called great people. They're called great people, uh, that if you earn enough points, you'll get, you'll get like Galileo, he'll appear in your civilization museum.

Speaker 1:          06:20          I firmly believe that in a hundred years. The next, you know, sisalation 50, you'll be able to earn a great merchant to Shane Smith because of how, like I, you know, he was able to build this empire. He did it through very clever ways of getting investment. And I admittedly, I really liked the stuff they used to do back in the day. I think the guys, wow, he, he knows how to do it. And the reason I bring him up is because the big story about traffic assignment was vice losing like 17% because of that practice they were doing. So he really knew how to do the smoke and mirrors. You know what, when you look at the other, uh, when you look at how it pays out, plant pans out to all the other news outlets and then having gets laid off, you have to, one, you don't, you don't have to wonder why a thousand jobs just got lost in the past week.

Speaker 1:          07:02          It was just investment money. And once they reached their threshold, it all came crashing down. The, the, the modern farmer example, like the modern farmer, what does it, I think it's just the clicks. Just the fact that that you can actually buy those clicks and attribute them to something different. And then you can tell people in the oil company views I got, yeah, do that and send it over to Joe rogan.com Yo. Yeah. And there's other really clever things to like, um, I don't think this one is on par, but make you have one youtube channel with a thousand subs, make 10 more. Ask all your subs to subscribe. Now you've got 10,000 subs, get it. Same thousand people 10 times. And you've got, you go around telling people, I've got 10,000 subscribers when in reality it's just a thousand people on 10 channels. So it was really clever ways to inflate your numbers and this attracts investment.

Speaker 1:          07:55          It'll it also, but more importantly, it allows leverage in dealing with ad with ad buyers and ad networks. What are people doing when they're boosting up their Instagram numbers? Uh, I don't know a lot about Instagram trying to pull it up. I can't show you. Right. And I just went to a website by you, two views.com for $2,800. You can have a million views that's there. There's, there's, there's, there's um, there's, there's good reasons to do it. Not if you want to be a youtuber. If you want to be successful on youtube, buying views ensures you will never make it. But look at it this way. No one do this. No one, I am not advocating for one. I'm about to explain film 10 videos, a full season of a, the Joe Rogan travel adventure by a million views on each to be padded out over a month. Go to a and, e, look at this show, we launched million views per episode.

Speaker 1:          08:45          You want to buy it? Wow. It's got a bunch of fans, a million people watch you see the episodes. Fantastic. You seen it. You see what I mean? Yes. Well if you're full of shit, but hey, there are people who, who it's snake oil is people who do this. But here's the thing, you get access to a network with real views, you'll get traffic, right. You know, if you can trick your way into getting on TV, fake it till you make it, it's dirty. It's a, it's illegal. Right. And that's fraud. Well actually I don't know if that, I don't think it is fraud if while I am the, the clicks like that, I think, I think New York, there was, someone sent me an article that uh, the attorney general of ones that may have been New York said, misrepresenting yourself online through fake views, clicks and likes is illegal. I think what they were saying is that using other people's images to create fake accounts is like invasion of privacy or something. But we're getting to that point. But you know, there's people who play that game, I guess you, you, you can really, you can really pull it off. I've met a lot of people who, there's a bunch of tricks, man.
