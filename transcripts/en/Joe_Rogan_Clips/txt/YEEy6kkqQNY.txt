Speaker 1:          00:00          For, uh, you know, fast rising stars that are a rising because of their beastliness in there, knock out power. It's not uncommon for them to not train Jujitsu. Right. We've seen plenty of them, you know what I mean? How crazy would it be if Zingano actually trained Jujitsu? Right. And fell knowing at the time for that. You know what I mean? We don't know what he does. Right. We don't know if he, they, she just hit, you know what I mean? It's probably not going to have a center, but how loud, if he didn't say he just, he just went to Danaher's and just fell in love with John Danaher. They just became best friends now would be any jumped in. Imagine how good, you know what I mean? With Jujitsu, he's like, how old is you could only survive with knock out power for so long.

Speaker 1:          00:48          You know what I mean? After a while you're going to be getting clips easily. Tail Hook guys were killing this show, but talking over each other like this. Yeah. You're, you're 100% right. You know what I'm saying? Is eventually no matter, no. We see it over and over again. No matter how Beasley you are and how powerful you are with those punches, eventually you're going to get clipped, right? You're going to go down. So eventually you might have to switch your strategy to instead of going out there and just trying to knock a dude out to going out there and try and take it to town and submit this month, here we go. Well, he's so powerful. If he had good wrestling skills, holy shit, you're gonna find out. Right? Exactly. Says this is what if that has a thing he's like with wrestlers, don't you think that you have to learn it at a really young age? Well, George Saint Pierre didn't, right? Oh, good head. Damn.

Speaker 1:          01:39          Damn. Look how giant he lives. So shit dude, he's so big. So big. It's so dangerous. Shit. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Come on man. He's incredible. Did he blew his ACL, MCL, LCL. Something's wrong with his leg or maybe not. Dude and cane is one of the best of all time. That's how good in Ghana was. Damn. He got through that block. Fuck. He got through it and this guy I've ever seen, and it wouldn't have been a surprise if in Ghana was super cautious, maybe two rounds of being super cautious. We wouldn't be that surprise. Right? Chill out Bro. But the fact that he fucking threw down like this, boom, he went, oh you almost like forearm. You got forearmed in the first. The first she was his name. It, no, let's see. This again. Never got hit anywhere. Oh Jesus. Oh shall we say. Oh Wow.

Speaker 1:          03:04          Everybody missed it. We all missed it for Kina. Let's be real damn back injury. And I said this, that Lcl, MCL, blow MCL. Right then when it's bent this way, when it comes to, that's all of them. That's MCL. How old is he now? I don't know. But he's a weathered whatever he is. Shit turns 37 I wouldn't even fight. And you could only take so many wars. Each war is significant in your life. Like each one took some of your life and eventually that's it. You can't, you already, you went to five crazy wars. That's not that. That's what Tom or that ended that way. Well, you know what it is, man. I think guys that are that championship caliber like cane, their mind is so ferocious that their body is almost like a spaceship reentering. It's missing tiles and it starts fuck a chicken apart. They're so powerful in terms of their ability to teach driving. They just keep driving and then the knees go in, the neck goes in, the back goes and then you deal with these physical realities of the body that you're giving. It's still there.

Speaker 1:          04:17          I know the middle of that. I'm in the middle of trying to come back. You know what I mean? Right now since my shoulder, it's been six months since my shoulder surgery had my bicep reattached to my shoulder, had knee surgery about 10 months ago. That's still not 100% like it's still, they're not red. They're still 20 when they good Roland with I'm rolling with the hunting 30 pound blue belts and shit that he read write about shit. The last three weeks I've been rolling with some little blue belts that I got to be able to have like 50 pounds on him and have total control. You know, like at this point, you know what I mean? I'm still a little weird for franchisors are blown ACL for Kate. Well, I mean it definitely is a blown knee for cane, but Francis, when's your fight? Because like when Francis was coming after him and he clipped him, he definitely clipped him with that forearm behind the neck date, eat or Honda persist. That's a nightmare. That's 100% for him. That's a nightmare outcome. 100% cause Francis as little case I just clipped and knocked down. Do you want to hear that? They say, yeah. What did they have to say? Yeah, give me some volume, but I look at the tits on him. I don't hear anything. Good job, Jamie. There it goes.

Speaker 2:          05:36          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:55          I mean he believes it now. He did, but I liked it the way he was moving in on them, man. I mean he really did look,

Speaker 2:          06:07          talk us through it again

Speaker 1:          06:09          on that Land Rover. At that forum did the forum later in the back of his neck, maybe your hands was shit, blah, blah. You know what, man? I'm going to rethink what I said. I'm going to rethink it. I know. You see I stopped. I thought I saw his forearm clip. His neck. That's not where he blows it. Wait, no, no, no, no trouble. What do you think you did hit him with that? No, he kind of fell though before that. No, Jane goes, that's what it is. Yes. I'll just and shit. The thing is he's so heavy handed. I think you might be correct, but I do think that he connected with his neck or the guys this heavy handed. Hold on a second. That no damage on his shoulder. That was nothing. Nothing, nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Yep. Nigos that because you're right. You're right. You're right. I was wrong. I thought it was, I thought it hit his neck. It did not hit his neck. It hit his back. Right shoulder. Right elbow was clear. There is the total up. Here we go. Holy Shit Dude. He was throwing around. He's a freak for it to saint ghetto.

Speaker 2:          07:15          You're right.

Speaker 1:          07:20          That's a defensive line right there.

Speaker 2:          07:23          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:23          A middle linebacker, right? Well, he's not done. See the thing about this guys, he, he hasn't been finding for very long though. Even though he loses to steep. Bain has that, that timid and scared Lewis. He says so little mileage. What does it say about his name? Hold on.

Speaker 2:          07:43          That's how it happened. I know it wasn't the result you're looking for. It will take some time, but how soon might we see you back in, you know, they're more calm and relaxed. Ready to go. This why this war. So breaking. Everyone was going to happen

Speaker 1:          08:03          or it's the worst. Very classy. Yeah. Came very classy. You know, never bitter. How weird is it? The Fox and this one, he's not even talking about his knee thing is in retire. Things here. Retire.

Speaker 2:          08:21          No need to apologize. I know I speak for you upstate fans around the world,

Speaker 1:          08:25          by the way. How good. How good is Jon Anik? He's a bass. That's the best. It's such a bummer to lose that wonderful that Jon Anik is so good. I love John. I'm so impressed with him. Like when I worked with him, he's the best. He's so like, he's such a good commentator. Here's a little thing right here. The first thing I'm going to make sure it ESPN MMA, like let's look at this was the shoulders was the, was maybe an uppercut uppercut might've landed right there. Ooh, my right there. Right there. Right away. Upper cut might've sat them down. The opera cut mine high iron cheese. God, here we go again. Here we gotta go. So nothing driving so far. Not Right. No, no.

Speaker 1:          09:17          You sell. Can I redeem myself? Okay, let's see. You are different anger. I'm like cheese. Ice missed it. That was a legit, it's a legit, when I was getting too close, he blew his knee out for sure because the uppercut watching Sandown cause is what's important. Matt Taibbi has a fantastic article out right now about one of the problems with society today is that people look at the news like they look at sports. Like someone asks me write about things. You have to know everything. But it's a great article. Matt Taibbi. This is a perfect example of four guys who are lifelong martial artists and we both went both ways. I was like, you're right, and then we saw it again and like, you're right. That's how you're supposed to look at Shit. Yeah. That's how you supposed to let them lines. It can't be attached.

Speaker 1:          10:24          Certain fights he gets stopped early. Okay. Tj Answer Huda. I thought it was stopped early due. I've talked to people that say they didn't think it was stopped early and I'm like, all right, hey, I'll listen to me. Listen, he clipped him, but I felt like when I watch it that you got to give a guy a chance to fight more, but especially on that, hey, you out in the NFL, when they review plays, they review them and one of the most important things about reviewing a play is that you have multiple angles. Yeah, it's all three angles. They keep going back to the first angle we didn't get, we didn't get a good enough angle because that right hand was like a ghost writing. I didn't see it. You guys saw it. I didn't see it so exciting. With shit like that is going on and the UFC truck is the best in the world.

Speaker 1:          11:11          Like mark tell the grotto and all those dudes back there, Anthony Giordano and the whole crew, they're always moving. Mark Delicate. Rodney Rodney motherfucker. He works, he figures out what the replay shine love him. He's like, I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I fucking love that dude. He's the shit. So He's, he does like, he'll like pick the play by play angles. He'll pick lecture and cause he talks about fights because he knows. Yeah, Todd Feldman made bank off a fucking Francis by the way. He did big bank. Damn. I'm telling you dude, if that guy keeps learning and it seems like he got out, he had a weird spot. But you know what I really like about that weird spot that he got into? Yep. He was honest about it. He said, I carried over fear from my last fight. Oh, a guy who can look at himself that honestly plus his ego got out of control cause he's not going to dude's out and then that's a good thing.

Speaker 1:          12:07          He know. He said that an interview like even as his ego, just coaches, like he just thought he was bigger than the game. Right. But the on how bold and now he fucking just knocked out Cain Velasquez before that. He murked fucking homeboy. I mean Chris Blades, hi. Can't remember the name. He looked, he looked like he was in a different weight category. He's the, based on your strength, you know, it is like the future is an athlete that really at 265 pounds, it doesn't have to gain any weight. It doesn't have to lose anyway. Oh they're going to show it to us again. The the future is and can we talk who hasn't deterred debut a Fox. Cain gets knocked up by G jds. Jesus Christ, ESPN. He gets knocked up by Francis and he took that jab right there to Frances Frances Clifton with a hard job to be to understand what you're saying.

Speaker 1:          12:56          Okay. That's a legit point. I just wanted to be like, oh, 100% some quick fast and I want to say that again. I want to do that. How fast he is. Back up just a wee bit. Yes. Just out of the play. This over and over. Let's look. Let's look at this. The exchange kitchen. We're sweet C he hits him. Nothing fucking right hand, right upper cut shovel. It's a shocking struggle. Can we get slow mo is that he hits him with a rock and then you need the shush of the faith instead of, he said, try one more time. I think his knees. Okay. Right now. Not Hell's now. Ooh, wait a minute. That's why I came to him and he goes, I came in to close too soon. He's so powerful. Watch this. Watch that Shit Jamie. Just play, play, pause, play, pause, play, pause, play punks, directv guy like it's a VCR in the nineties this angle, it looks like we're trying to get a tick in the nineties for sure in Ghana is a good angle for in Ghana right here.

Speaker 1:          13:59          Oh right. Watch this watch has head move. Ooh. And then he got clipped and that's what I, that's why came. Did it address that? And he goes, I got too close too. So he's too, when you, when you think about a person that might be like 41 pounds on the cocaine party where you're saying you think about a person like he, you know, he's, he's essentially like optimize their to 65 or he's optimized. He's like a of real through 65 CC's for five rounds of July, z optimized. Well here's the thing though, he, all he has to do is get better at that first round and do you really think a lot of guys are going to make it into their second or third? They've just played it in slow motion. Oh fuck. I missed this angle. It looks like you missed this and I don't really know.

Speaker 1:          14:43          He shovel who know us. Can we hold on, hold on. Hold on. Slow motion. I clipped him there. Right kind. Hundred percent. That's clips. That's 100% says that you see his head move. That's why king throws a single leg on the ref cause he's concussed. He went for the single friends. This is the scariest of all time. Guys win. Oh fall time over ubering dude. The thing about Francis, his speed, he's he, he's learning at this like really rapid rate. When you look at a guy that's only been doing it for how many years now? 100% trained. He's been fighting for like maybe five years, I think five years from the time he learns martial arts. His Dad was some legendary fights. He was doing this with saying, dude, he's a movie character. If he can just get over the hump that he got, look the steep, pay me. Oh, chicks fight. That's, that's what's up man. I mean, he got to the top of the mount dude. He's a funny guy. DC now. Revenger boy.
