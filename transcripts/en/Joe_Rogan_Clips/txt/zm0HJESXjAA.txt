Speaker 1:          00:00          They don't and you know, it's not there either, you know. And in fact, I've started to try and lobby doctors to stop prescribing sleep and don't make the mistake that that's me suggesting prescribing sleeping pills, that's a separate straight sleeping pills are associated with significantly higher risk of death and cancer. And, and I'm happy to speak about that too, was the one chapter in the book that I think the um, the legal team of my publisher took, took a very long, long look at, but I think doctors, to come back to your point, they on average only have about two hours of sleep education in the medical curriculum. So one third, two hours, two hours, one third of their, this podcast has been two hours. Yeah, that's fucking crazy. And so it's not frightening. That's terrifying. And I bet you probably have laid things out better in this podcast than you would get in those two hours of education.

Speaker 1:          00:50          I don't know about that, but I think if I'll give you that credit, if they could eat, if they could increase that, you know, I'm desperately appealing for the senior, it's a third of their patient's life, but they only get two hours of education. But the other problem is the medical industry itself. By the way, you know that residents, that data, you know at residents working a 30 hour shift of 460% more likely to make diagnostic errors in the intensive care unit relative to when they're working 16 hours. If you have elective surgery, you should ask your surgeon how much sleep they've had in the past 24 hours. If they've had six hours of sleep or less, you have a 170% increased risk of a major surgical error, such as sort of organ damage or hemorrhaging relative to that same surgeon if they had been well rested.

Speaker 1:          01:43          And then the irony here by the way, is that when a resident finishes, a 30 hour shift, gets back into their car to drive home, there is a 168% increased risk that they will get into a car accident because of the under slip seat being ending up back in the same emergency room where they just came from. But now as a patient too, from a car crash, you know, it's, we need to radically rethink the importance of sleep in education, in, in business, in the workplace and in medicine too. Why do they do that to residents? It's a fascinating story. Um, so there's, there's a chapter here in the book on this too. It's a guy called William Holsted and he set up the first resident surgical program in the United States at Johns Hopkins University and he was known for being able to stay awake for these heroic lengths of time, days on end.

Speaker 1:          02:38          It was incredible, like superhuman strength tuns out that in later years after he died, there was a dirty secret that he was actually a cocaine addict. That son of a bitch. And here's what happened. It wasn't his fault. Ellian is Korea. He was examining the anesthetic capacities of cocaine. So you know, if, well I'm not going to save, you know, you may have heard from, uh, perhaps colleagues that when you snort cocaine you get a numb face. The reason is because it's, it blocks nerves. Kay said from colleagues, my colleagues have told me I've actually never done cocaine. I've know quite a few people who have and they will, you know, they'll have this sort of numbness. It's the reason is because cocaine is also a nerve blocking agent, like lighter cane, lighter cane. Exactly. Times about this. Yesterday ironically on the podcast and about doctors becoming drug addicts, the initial doctor's has started doing light of cane.

Speaker 1:          03:34          Holsted was one of them. He became an accidental cocaine addict and then he's up for days. He was up for days and um, he structured a program where he expected his residence to match him to go toe to toe with them. Our, that huge remain. It sounds like what a coke had would do, come on and stay away. Unbelievable. And I think the story was that he actually knew that there was a problem. He went to rehabilitation, checked in under a different surname and one part of the, um, regiment for him coming off cocaine was to prescribe morphine. And at the end of the rehabilitation program, he came out with both the cocaine addiction and heroin addiction. And so now there's rumors, you know, that he would get his shirts laundered in Paris, you know, in France. And you know, they would come back and it wasn't just the white starch, you know, shirts that were in the box that we were other whites substances too.

Speaker 1:          04:33          But that's, you know, you ask a great question, where did that come from? Where's that history? The legacy seems to date back to William Holstead, who is an accidental cocaine addict. And there we have then maintained that inhumane practice in medicine, which is so critical to be awake and aware and to be sharp. You're cutting people open, you're operating on people. And think back to what we said about being awake. You know, you would never accept treatment from a doctor who started, you know, looking at your child who's sick with an appendicitis at three m in the morning, who then switched some whiskey and says, yeah, I'm going to do the operation. That's fine. You would, you would go ballistic. Well, why do we accept treatment after 20 hours of being awake? You're as impervious. You would be if you were legally drunk. So unfortunately we placed young residents in this position of, you know, acting and operating and decision making under conditions of insufficient sleep.

Speaker 1:          05:31          One in five medical residents will make a serious medical error due to insufficient sleep. One in 20 medical residents will kill a patient because of a fatigue related error. One in 20 that's crazy right now, you know, there are well over 20,000 medical residents. For a hundred of them, five were going to kill people, accidental deaths. Think about that number. That's insane. If we were to solve the sleep epidemic in medicine, you know, we could start saving lives and I don't know what it is. Is it just a, you know, an old boys' network where we say, well we went through it. Yes. So you've got to go through it. You know, and there's, the data now is so prolific, you know, I write it all about that and try to make a build or an evidence based, you know, emotionless cold case for sleep in medicine, asleep prescription for medicine as it were. Or most people don't

Speaker 2:          06:22          realize their requirements that residents have.

Speaker 1:          06:25          No. And, and they are, they are literally, you know, beyond human capacity thinking that, you know, Hubris and some degree of hours on the job is going to be able to allow you to sort of, you know, cut short what took three and a half million years to sort of, you know, get in place, which is an eight hour night of sleep that's just thick headed. You know, it's, and I think the medical profession that may be at the stage where it's my mind is made up, don't confuse me with the facts. Wow. That, that

Speaker 2:          06:59          this is blowing me away. I just don't understand how the very people that are working on the health of patients and fixing them and repairing injuries and taking care of diseases, those are the people that are ignoring one of the primary factors of disease and errors and cognitive function. It's impairment. It's a travesty. I have a friend who's an ophthalmologist and he tells a story about during his residency, he was uh, is, is back in the 80s and you had a pager. He was on the toilet with a tray of food on his lap because he didn't have time to eat and go to the bathroom. So as eating food and he fell asleep and then his pager went off and he's like, fuck my life.

Speaker 1:          07:45          How many warnings, how many warning bells do you need to tell you that you're in a deleterious state if you use with your trousers around your ankles, with food or via face. And yet you're in the deepest stages of non rem sleep and he's a guy who was working on people's eyes. Yeah. It's crazy. Yeah. I mean, I mean it's, you know, sleep is equally absent for the patient in the hospital setting. We know that somewhere between 50 to 70% of all ICU alarms are either unnecessary or ignore bubble, you know, and the one place where you desperately need the Swiss army knife of health, that is a good night of sleep is the one place where you get at least, which is on a hospital ward. We could, we could exit people out of hospital beds early at the data is already there. For the neonatal intensive care unit, they used to leave bright lights on 24 seven and that would prevent sort of the signaling for sleep and wake and sleep and wake.

Speaker 1:          08:43          And that cycle is critical if you regularize sleep, sorry. If you regularize the light in the neonatal intensive care unit, those infants ended up having high levels of oxygen saturation because were sleeping better, their weight gain was dramatically increased and they ended up exiting the neonatal intensive care unit five weeks earlier. Whoa. Simple things. You know, why don't we do something like this in medicine? When you come in onto a hospital ward, you get this on an international flight, travel for free, earplugs facemask even just that by itself could help people to start, get better sleep. Next on the hospital admission form. Tell me when you normally go to sleep and when you normally wake up. And to the best of our ability, we as doctors will try to sort of, you know, manage your health care around your natural sleep tendencies. If we could do that, you know, sleep is, is the elixir of life.

Speaker 1:          09:39          It is the most widely available democratic and powerful healthcare system I could ever possibly imagine. Why aren't we leveraging that and taking it? That's one of the greatest hacks that medicine could actually, you know, inflect does stunning. But how's this being received by doctors? Are they reluctant to listen to you? I mean, what, what, what is happening with all this data and you're, you're passionate cry for extra sleep or more sleep or the proper sleep, I should say. It's starting to happen. I mean, when the book came out, which was sort of the hub that came out in back in October and, and some people started to give push backs to sort of in the medicine realm, you know, there was some concerns about continuity of care that if you keep switching residents out every 16 hours that you wouldn't have continuous patient care. And that was a problem.

Speaker 1:          10:31          Um, well there are other medical training systems. For example, France or Sweden, New Zealand, they do this all the time. They do not allow their residents to undergo anything longer than either a 14 or a 16 hour shift. They train their residents in the same amount of time or less. And if you look at the rankings of their medical health systems around the world, they rank far higher than the United States. So you can't tell me that longer work hours for residents, for example, on necessary to train good doctors. The evidence just doesn't support itself, had some push back there. But for the most part, I think people are receptive once they know the information. And I think I'm the, I've been someone who's been to blame here. I've known this evidence for, you know, I've been doing sleep research now for 20 or so years. We are with sleep where we were with smoking 50 years ago.

Speaker 1:          11:24          We had all of the evidence about the deathly carcinogenic cardiovascular disease issues, but the public had not been aware where no one had adequately communicated. The science of, you know, smoking to the public the same I think is true for sleep right now. That's part of the motivation for why I wrote the book, why I've been doing or trying to do a lot of publicity. I'm a very shy person and I don't like being in the spotlight, but I feel as though there is a mission that whose voice has not been actually gifted yet and I wanted to try and help them be a sort of asleep diplomat. I mean that's why I choose the handle on social media, trying to be there as an ambassador for sleep. And now once people start to understand the science as we've spoken about for two hours, then people start to actually realize it's not the third pillar of good health alongside diet and exercise.

Speaker 1:          12:13          It's the foundation on which those two are the things set. You know, for example, if you're dieting but you're not getting sufficient sleep, 70% of all the weight that you lose will come from lean body, mass muscle and not fat. Your body becomes stingy in giving up its fat when it's under slept. So once you get this information out there, things are starting to change. I've started to have some discussions with the World Health Organization. They seem to be very interested now in getting, getting to grips with sleep. I love to speak to first world governments though. When was the last time you saw any first world nation have a government supported public health campaign around sleep? I don't know any. We've had them for, you know, drink driving for risky behaviors, you know, for drugs, for alcohol, for healthy eating. Sleep should be a part of that equation. You know, I want to lobby governments to start to instigate this and it will save them millions of dollars. The Rand Corporation did an independent survey two years ago on the demonstrable cost of a lack of sleep too, global economies. What they found was that a lack of sleep costs most nations, about 2% of their GDP, the gross domestic product here in America, that number was $411 billion caused by insufficient sleep, solve the sleepless epidemic. You could almost double the budget for education and you could almost half the deficit for healthcare.

Speaker 1:          13:40          Wow.
