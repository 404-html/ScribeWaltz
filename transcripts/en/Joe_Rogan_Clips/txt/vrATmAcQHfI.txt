Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience.

Speaker 2:          00:03          Right. And is the same. It will be at a parent parent. A lot of parents are really lazy and you watch it happen when they give their kid an iPad or you know or you know, put them in front of the computer. That whole thing just happened with Elsa Gate, which was you know, borderline hilarious that parents were getting trolled into their kids watching really fucked up like cartoons.

Speaker 1:          00:20          Yeah. Elsie get, I forgot the name. The name of it. Yeah that was crazy. We've talked about that a bunch of times about the babies with the broken bottles over their head kept having the same scene play out. Kids would get drunk whether they were a kid, mice or kid docs or they would get drunk. A bottle would go flying through the air and hit the baby in the head and blood would be everywhere. It was, it was like a baby's nightmare to, those videos were so

Speaker 2:          00:43          crazy. It was a bunch of street. David Lynch for sure. It was a punishment for shitty parents who weren't watching you know their kids and what they're putting on their TV. Cause if you were just paying attention for a minute, you, I'm saying write it. You have to stop paying attention for a couple hours for a kid to get there. So it was only really shitty parents that we're dealing with that. Is that really true? It's dude, yet there was no way to like land on that just by googling Spiderman. That wasn't the first one that was coming up. It was, uh, they would, I think there were like paying to get into like a loop of certain videos. Like it was, it really, I was obsessed with it for like a week and I just couldn't stop going on under that sub reddit page. And it was freaky dude. They weren't really radio regular porn.

Speaker 1:          01:26          Yeah, there's a Spiderman ones and all these, I think they took some of them down, but then it gets to this place where you're like, okay, are you taking it down because it's targeting children? Are you taking it down because you can't show cartoon babies getting hit in the head with bottles. Because if that's what you're saying, boy, there's a lot of fucking south parks that you're not going to be able to show. There's a lot, a lot, a lot of different things. Yeah. Where's the line? Because you think this is like creepy and is luring kids in versus the just the act of it was a funny, you know Tim and Eric Sketch and a cartoon baby got hit in the head with a bottle. You'd be like, what the fuck? These guys are nuts. That's what you'd said. But you wouldn't be like saying this has gotta be removed off of Youtube.

Speaker 1:          02:09          Yeah, it's hard to pay attention. What's the intention of it? But you could easily say like, oh well South Park is a cartoon. So is that appealing to kids? But I think to Lewis his point that the solution isn't that this shit needs to be banned. The solution is just like let parents know always the solution. Every single time we talk about Louis, what was the other one we watched? Oh father, your father, the two kids. And it's really just creepy as shit dude happen. All right, so this guy, another like one of those like that the kids are watching that. If you watch it for a second, you're like, this is all

Speaker 2:          02:39          pulled it off. It was a dad and his channel, I'm sorry, I forget the name of the channel, but he had his two little girls who were probably seven and nine years old and they were doing like just kind of weird shit dude. They're like eating chocolate bars and there'd be chocolate all over their face and then they'd make weird sounds and they'd climb up like you know, stairs and they'd showed from like behind there butt and it was very fucking pedophilia. I don't even know. It was fucked up dude. And this guy is channel got taken down and the guy's like doing an interview. He's like, no dude, whatever. We also millions of subscribers to the channel making tons of money paying first house with this channel. Whoa. And they shut the whole channel down. And what did he say when they interviewed him? I don't know. I've read some thing when it was just kinda like, yeah, we're trying to get our channel back and you know, he was just like very innocent. There was another thing the same. Oh fuck. I'm on my own time. I got to go to Vimeo. Um, but the same when we were talking about this stuff, there was moms, they were regular like mom bloggers, right? And they bring like their daughter to Kmart, right? This is the channel by the way,

Speaker 1:          03:39          terminates toy freaks channel amid broader crackdown on disturbing kids content. Okay.

Speaker 2:          03:46          It is very, like what Jay said, it's a very David Lynch type vibe. Like you feel like you're in some nightmare world where everyone's just acting not the right human way. That 8.5 million subscribers, gold plaques that you have amongst the top

Speaker 1:          04:03          most 100 most of you channels on youtube. That's incredible.

Speaker 2:          04:08          Either while pacifiers in their mouth it, dude, it's fucking bizarre. You gotta somehow it got somehow got to that level before. Can we watch some of this? Yeah. I can't show it.

Speaker 1:          04:17          We can't show it on TV. Can we watch it? Is there a way we can not see it? We're about to get raided. You get what you figured out. Okay. Yeah. Don't know what the problem is. Whenever we put something on youtube that shouldn't be on youtube, we get flagged.

Speaker 2:          04:33          Um, there was like mommy bloggers and they would like have a video of them and their daughter going to like the supermarket and it'd be like 500

Speaker 1:          04:39          views. Yeah, don't do it Jamie. If if they, I was thinking of Youtube flags, not planning to see it. Oh, okay. So no one else could see it on another website. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry Louis. What?

Speaker 2:          04:50          Okay. So yeah, so then, and then they do another, the same mommy blogger would do one called bath time and she's like bathing her five year old and it's not anything like more than her like sitting in the bathtub. But those videos were getting millions of views and then the mom would like disable the comments and turn off the thumbs up and the thumbs downs. So they were just monetizing, you know, pedophiles jerking off to their daughters in a bathtub. And it was, this is just like a whole subculture that was happening on youtube that was sort of just, nobody was really talking about it and they kind of made it go away. It wasn't even a big deal.

Speaker 1:          05:20          Cool. So this, I'm watching this, it's not disturbing and all, it's just dumb. They just eating weird food and then and getting like whipped cream and ice cream and cake and nachos altogether.

Speaker 2:          05:34          Well here's what happens. Babies. This is really targeted toward babies. They like the colors. So what happened? Like they see these flashing crazy colors. Them I'm packaging candy and cake and eating cake and two year olds love the shit they keep on clicking on it. But pedophiles are also jerking off to these girls putting chocolate bananas in their mouth. That was sort of the issue. So they got, you know, the pencil subscribed to whatever cause the, they want to put

Speaker 1:          05:58          their kid in front of a TV and have the TV babysit them. Um, but it was also another big part of the people who are watching this. You see the comments and some of the, sometimes the comments were like encrypted and like in different languages and they were using code words and how they're using that pizza gate yet it's all connected up. It's fucking crazy. If you make a big complaint though about something you have to draw a conclusion to, it really makes it seem like you're the person thinking that you're like, come on, you don't think that's hot. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. You wouldn't want to jerk off to this. Come on. We're all jerking off to this then who didn't jerk off to that a little earlier? Mitchell that a cheeto with sour cream on it. I'll check it off to anybody. You're just in it for the food.

Speaker 1:          06:37          Get these kids out of here or they have family they didn't notice. Say what can and can't be on TV though or on video or on, you know, when do you say they're going to want this? But I know right, but whose day? Right. Cause we've all, we've all got this weird thing about free speech because if it wasn't for free speech we wouldn't be able to do anything. Wouldn't be able to do podcasts, wouldn't be able to comedy. You'd get in trouble for everything. It's very important to be able to express your ideas, but what if those ideas are, what if you're a pedophile? Like what if? What about that? Are you allowed to do pedophile anime? Like how it would, where's the, where's the line and why? Why are we able to draw that line? You know, I draw a Dick Right now when I will dry deck. Here's the deck. Now if I say this is a four year old's Dick. Okay, there you go. Well, we'll just say the four year old got a big Dick. He's got a giant bed. [inaudible] man who put a four year old pussy around it too soon.
