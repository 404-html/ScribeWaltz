Speaker 1:          00:00          Molly and in wrestling it's, it's still that way. I was looking at Tj Dillashaw Liggett, Tj Dillashaw. Oh yeah, but that's hard to say. Let's go. Let's talk about that fight because I watched that fight several times. I am of the team. That was a quick stoppage. Early startups for sure early here. Here's my, here's my other point with that. When there 125 pounds, you can let it go on a little longer than if they were heavyweights. I'd hear more on the side of let it go long because to 125 days, it could be a thousand pounds each in that fight got stop quick. It's fucking fine. Especially when talking about a legacy, it's spending 69 bucks. How about Tj? Tj legacy fight. That guy drained his body to get done. 125 pounds. Hey, don't get me wrong though, Henry. So who knows a bad motherfucker. He probably would've beat him anyway, but for people that are paying for the the event, we want to see some highlight shit.

Speaker 1:          00:55          Definite knockout. We don't want to, you know, I thought I thought the ref, whoever he was, he was just in the beginning. You could tell he wanted to stop at her. Like there's guys that they just, they just want to get in there and like saved their lives. He's a really good man. I made a mistake. Look, it's fucking hard to do. It's a hard job. I am so glad I'm not a referee because when they make a mistake, they can't say, oh, I fucked up. Let's do it again. You remember they used to be able to, do you remember when big John McCarthy stopped the fight between Marilla Bustamante and uh, Matt, uh, Fuck Matlin. Matt Lindland. Matt Lindland tapped and said he didn't tap and Big John McCarthy let the fight continue. Matt and [inaudible] got him in an arm bar. Oh Damn. We missed an arm bar. That was some serious Jujitsu right though.

Speaker 1:          01:41          We'll see it in the highlights. Were were Jesus, fortunately just warm talk. Let's get those nice. Hey Belle towards got some fucking high level fights now man. They are like on the way up there as close to the UFC, you can get right. They have the biggest prospect in the sport and Pico. Yeah, by far. Yeah. Taking it back a little bit. What about Conan Sylvia era versus soccer? Fucking rob. I remember that Shit. He redid the fight. The whole fight got read old school. They got stopped John too, and then they decided, you know what, let them fight again. Big John. He got hater that Conan hit Sakuraba soccer. Our dropped and went down for a single and they stopped the fight and he's like, what the fuck are you doing? But it was in Japan. They pulled them aside in Japan. It's like wild west, Bro. You know, like, no.
