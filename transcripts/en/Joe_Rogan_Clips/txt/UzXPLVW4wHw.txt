Speaker 1:          00:00          When you look at the DMT experience and you look at its effect on the human mind, how much have you subscribes to? The idea that we're looking at is some sort of a chemical gateway, chemical gateway to what whatever it is to whatever that DMT experiences that this is something that your brain has the ability to travel to. But I mean, since we know that the body does produce this and when we know that it's possible for people to, I mean I've never done it, but I know that people who do Kundalini Yoga have apparently reported trip, like experiences that are very similar to a real DMT flash or the mind has this ability to do this on its own. What do you think that that, is that something worth considering that this is, this is some sort of a pathway to a nearby dimension or to something that's around us all the time, but we just don't have access to with normal neurochemistry he had it all.

Speaker 1:          01:00          There are too many what ifs or who know. I mean there's, you know, there's so much in what you've said where you have to go back and, and unpack all of these things. When we got excited about DMT, Terence and me and the early in the late sixties, what led us to go to La Chorrera was that it seemed like a completely different order of magnitude than any of the other psychedelics. And we came to it really from a childhood that was steeped in science fiction. So we carried with a theater with us. The idea, this really is another dimension and it may be a portal to another dimension. And as science fiction nuts, we were totally okay with that. And we thought baby DMT was, and maybe it is, but, or it's, it, it somehow pulls the curtain back on something that's around us all the time that we don't see.

Speaker 1:          02:01          Um, but again, in thinking about these things, is it something that is entirely within the brain that it originates or is it something that, is it like a lens that you know, or our eyes are covered with, with, uh, with filters and DMT temporarily removes those filters? I think it's hard to know. I mean, I think maybe experimentally we could, we could begin to approach this. Have you, you know, and I, I think we really know. I think that's another thing about natural philosophy. Um, that's important that science is overlooking and natural philosophy always remembers the limits of what is known. You know, and science is a bit arrogant about what they think is known. You know, they only in science only understands a small fraction of all there is to know. And I was another psychedelic always remind me of this, you know, when I take it, remember the limitations of your knowledge or sometimes more or less kindly says it, right?

Speaker 1:          03:07          You don't know shit. And it's true. We don't know shit. You know, and sciences can forget that, you know, but as far as this DMT a thing, you know, this is actually a, there's controversy about this because, uh, you know, um, a lot of it, a lot of people who have worked in this area say it's, it's pretty well established that endogenous DMT can produce these states, that the pineal can secrete DMT under certain circumstances or under stress. The lungs can produce large amounts of DMT that are translocated to the brain. Um, but it's, it's not so clear that that goes on. I mean, it's clear that it can be produced. But David Nichols, you know, who knows a thing or two about pharmacology, it, founder of the Heffter institute worlds, you know, most, uh, authoritative highest authority when it comes to the chemistry and pharmacology of, of psychedelics.

Speaker 1:          04:16          He's the redeemer. He's taken a reductionist argument on this that's Kinda hard to, uh, to knock down, which is that DMT is produced in dodgy honestly, but it's chopped up so quickly that it never reaches the site of action. And it never reaches the levels at the neuron that it would take to activate the neuron. Um, you know, so want to consume or are you saying endogenously produced the MTN endogenously so that it, it does, when you consume it, obviously you flood the system and you'll get much higher levels than has ever produced indogenous Lee and I, but we haven't really measured the levels produced in dodgy honestly, during especially these extreme states. And that's part of the problem. That's part of the problem. How do you do that? Have you done, how do you do that? What have you done Kundalini and tried to recreate? No, I haven't either. I've been, you know, Terence had that fantastic joke. Uh, it was, uh, uh, talk about, uh, that this monk had PR practice, the city of levitation. Do you remember this one? And uh, that the Buddha came to town and he said for the last 20 years I practiced the city of levitation. I can now walk on water. And the Buddhist said, yeah, but the ferries only a nickel.

Speaker 1:          05:39          It's like, do you want to practice Kundalini for 10 years? And, and Bang your head towards the East or just smoked DMT 30 seconds later. Right in the center of the universe. But I think the last time I was on your show, we talked about this, uh, this other thing, this Algina light we discussed. Yes. And I don't know if you've interviewed. Yeah, we have to buy you one. I said we were, we've totally dropped the ball on that. You don't have to buy. No, we do have to buy. You want water by herself. What? I'm going to buy myself one venue and this time we're going to do it. We said we're good. I do too many podcasts. I forget everything. I know. I, I've never bought the agile alliance is interesting because you know, I mean he claims and that was the conversation we had.

Speaker 1:          06:23          He claims yes, this stimulates in dacha synthesis of writing this down right now. Put, spell it out for me. A Jay and the AE, uh, ODG, no light. And his website is [inaudible] dot com and there's some good PDFs on there that'll explain what this is about on that Jamie. Yeah. And now it's quite a big time cause I just mentioned this guy show. Right. But anyway, he, this light can produce some sort of a side note experience. He claims it stimulates DMT synthesis in the pineal. When you lie underneath that, it's just a bunch of, it's, it looks like a floor lamp, you know, with a rectangular mount bunch of LEDs underneath it, which he programs with an iPad and different patterns. You lie under it and you, it stimulates hypnagogic hallucinations looking at them that are a lot like uh, that guy looks like an old school freak.

Speaker 1:          07:25          Look at him. He's a zen monk. I bet he is. Amongst other things. He used to be an apple engineer. He was real jobs right hand man when whilst he went the right way, he went the right way. So he's got this thing. Is that cord going down to her head and a hard time seeing what's happening cause something's wrapped around her head. That better not be a crystal. I think that run out of this room. No, I think it's a deceptive thing. He didn't attach anything to meet prospective issue court going, okay. I said, so you lie under this thing. And first time I lied under it, I thought I got all these colors. I go, all these hypnagogic affects, you know, and nice patterns and all that. Like a sub threshold DMT experience. And I said, well, you know, the uh, the LEDs are all changing color, right?

Speaker 1:          08:16          And that's how I see it. He says, no, they're white. The colors are coming from you. You're so fine. The colors. So, okay, so it was interesting. And then we got into the conversation. How do you know this is stimulating DMT? How do you know that's the effect? Turns out it's not so easy to nail that down. You know, because the empty is saw a femoral in the system. You can't, uh, take urine samples or cerebral spinal fluid or anything. It would be gone by the time you, you did it. So the only way, well maybe not the only way, but one way you could do it is you could do something called a, um, it's essentially you couldn't do this to a human because you couldn't, you couldn't get an FDA approval for it, but you could put a micro capillary tube right next to the pineal that will absorb things as they are released.

Speaker 1:          09:13          And then you could recover that and say, you know, levels of DMT or why couldn't you do that to a voluntary participant? Voluntary or not? You'd be screwing their brain up. Well, no, not necessarily, but you'd have a hard time getting permission. There might be, you could do it to a rat though. You could do it to her. Well, that's what cottonwood research foundation's done, right? They've done that. That's how they discovered DMT in the pineal, um, yeah, to a live rat. Yeah. Yeah. That's how they discovered it. That was the first proof. Right? That was the first proof. Nick Cozy, um, who's a pharmacologist at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. He was really the first one to show that DMT is a, uh, you know, endogenously produced. Now that's a sigma one agonist as well as a Serotonin agonist, which is another, another receptor.

Speaker 1:          10:07          Um, you know, lap. That's definitely that. But it's not clear what the function is. It's, it's a complicated issue, you know. Um, to figure this out, I'll send you a paper that Nicole's rotor elite l linked to a video where he discusses this and it's like, you know, he gave that at the breaking convention conference last summer that I was at and it was like, you know, he was like the Big Downer of the conference stride because everybody has this romantic idea and he comes along and just squashes it, you know, and it's like, man, here, you know, you have disappointed a lot of people, but on the other hand, reality is good. You know, facts are good. What guy did do that? Uh, that sort of made me think, made me think maybe there is something to it. He's tried, um, pre dosing with an Mao inhibitor. Just, just take banisteriopsis tea without them. The admixture about 30 minutes before going under the light, and then the, it's much more intense and it's much more prolonged. You've done this. I haven't done it. Um, but he claims that on other people say that it, it definitely enhances the, so that would indicate that the breakdown of DMT has been inhibited. Is he claiming that you could reach actual DNT states with this device upon practice? Yeah.
