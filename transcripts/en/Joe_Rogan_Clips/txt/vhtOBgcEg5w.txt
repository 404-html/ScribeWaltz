Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. I don't think that there's much truth in today's progressive left. No, I think there's an ideological war going on and I think especially with Trump in office, they feel like the gloves are off and all rules are out the window and anything goes. Yeah, I think people are flabbergasted and while I was telling Jamie at for the shower, like I'm not, I'm not without my criticisms for Trump, but I got it meant every time stuff just rolls off his back like water on a duck. I started fucking laughing like they were like the stormy Daniels things going to sink them. I have, I have a friend of mine who's who's gay and he's the nicest guy in the world, but he's so ridiculous. He's like, that's our Monica Lewinsky. She's our Monica. I go, dude, it's not going to work. I go, no one's going to care.

Speaker 1:          00:43          It's going to, it's going to disappear in a couple of weeks ago. We're in a 10 hour new cycle. Do you understand this? I go in 10 hours, some new shit comes along and nobody gives a fuck about Brett Ratner anymore and nobody gives a fuck about this guy. Nobody. And there's a new guy and there's a new thing and there's a new problem and it's a new thing. There's a new thing and you saying that this porn star thing, this is not 1994 this porn star thing is not going to sink him. He's going to deny it. Fake News, fake news and he's going to keep moving and there's going to be nothing. Yeah, I don't even, I don't even know what happened with that exactly, but to me I was remember I just was like, I got to disconnect for a bit because I've been just going, going, going.

Speaker 1:          01:16          So I disconnected and I'm like kind of popped my head in for half a day just because we're moving to a new studio, kind of like you've been doing and pop my head. It was like, well, what's in there? What's this outrage right now? Do I need to know about Donald Trump? And they said no. Yeah, he called a Haiti a shit hole and I just popped my head back on. I'm like, of course it is. That's it. No one cares. He was like, of course Haiti is. It doesn't mean you hate Haitians. Said, why did these people from these shithole countries want to come here? That's what he supposedly said. He says he didn't say it. Some people say he did. Other people say he didn't. Who Cares? So we're in a weird quagmire. Yeah. If he says that he did. Yeah. It's not the appropriate thing for a president of the United States to say.

Speaker 1:          01:53          But does it make sense that Donald Trump would say that? Yes. You want to know all, you know it's a shit hole because French Canadians are some of the most racist people you will find. Love you mom. But they create these French laws. I've talked about this before. Pure Glen, it means pure wool because they want to get rid of all the England phones. Right? And so then they had a huge Haitian immigration because there's a lot of, you know, French and people from Cameroon I special diseases and breeding and they were furious. So they tried to create laws to keep the Haitians out because they were, you know, they, it was just a clash of cultures. Here's the thing, Haiti is whether Donald Trump said it or not, as a country, a shitty place, and I don't think anyone cares anymore, doesn't mean I hate Haitians, doesn't mean I'm not empathetic to them.

Speaker 1:          02:30          But how fortunate that they're in a bad place. But how was it racist if especially you're criticizing a government which comprises of black people who are screwing a black citizenry. They've been doing it for decades. They've never gotten it right. Rainn Wilson took a picture from sandals, like a pickle picture from Club Med sandals. Most people don't even know what that is. The resort. That's so funny. Yeah, I think it is. It's a Bahamas, I think Jamaica, a few of those things. This is one of those places. No local, no locale and come all the other shit holes. I mean, I just think it's one of those things where I think if nothing else, Donald Trump has allowed people and we weren't Trump people. We've got so much flak from the alt right because we didn't support them. Right. I remember that. And you were more in support of Ted Cruz, right?

Speaker 1:          03:13          Oh, I'll let Carly Fiorina and Ben Shapiro. I mean Ben Carson a little bit. Right. I just thought it was hysterical. Oh, he's smart guy. He's like, it's so crazy. Yeah, he's like a Jim Henson care. My favorite thing was him with Jesus, the painting, but Jesus on his shoulder, my woe, Ben. So you can get a neuro surgeon because you were an absolute genius in that, but you don't have the sense of like, maybe I in put Jesus on myself like I'm a car. Well Jordan Peterson said something that's very brilliant. He said there is absolutely no correlation with being smart and being wise. It's true. It's true. There's a lot of people that are really fucking smart things, but they are not wise in terms of how they behave and how they think and how they conduct their life.

Speaker 2:          04:06          Okay.
