Speaker 1:          00:00          Thanks. I'm losing it, but it's what's left of it is still working on right. And we're live. Gentlemen. Hello Sean. Hey, how are you? Hello Tom. Hello Joseph. What's cool? You guys did a movie. Did you make a movie? We made a movie. Did you guys do movies? We do. We're moving. Guys. How many movies have you made? A one. Well, I bet you've made. How many of you made before? I like six, but yeah, but we've made one. We made one. Yeah. What's your favorite one? Other than the one that's right now? Which is definitely your favorite cause you're promoting it right now. Uh, sex drive. Sex drive is the one. Nobody knows about it. Nobody knows about it. I mean, it just, it was one of those movies that just opened and nobody knew about it, but it was a, it was a really, really fun movies.

Speaker 1:          00:37          Maybe we can change that. It's on iTunes or Netflix. Yeah. Yeah. It's all are James Marsden's in it? This is the one. Is this the one that you like when you made it? You're like, ed, maybe I'll go back to working fucking construction or whatever. Yeah. So I thought, I thought it was over after that. Did you finance it or anything? No, no. We made it, um, we made it with summit pictures and it was, it was, it was just amazing. They, they, uh, we were in town trying to get a career going, you know, try and try and make things happen. We were making a TV pilot at the time, which was a living hell. And, uh, and we had gone out and pitch this idea to a bunch of places and nobody bought it. So then in the middle of our, uh, editing, our pilot summit pictures called and said, um, we really, we keep thinking about that pitch.

Speaker 1:          01:22          Would you guys be willing to write it? And I said, you know what, tell him I was really busy. I said, tell him I'll write it if I can direct it. But I figured that would make them go away. And they said, all right. And so we went in and we wrote it and we turned it in and they green lit it. It was this crazy, it was just this crazy process where we've got this movie green lit and I think we wrote the draft and like a month. Then we turned it in and they, they loved it. And they said about, it's a, it's a, it's a teen road trip movie. It's about this, these kids that, uh, it was kind of in the early days of the, you know, Facebook and all that stuff. And it might've even been, I don't know, I can never track the, it might've even been like sort of my space into Facebook, that era, you know.

Speaker 1:          02:00          Um, but it was about a kid who meets a girl online and goes to lose his virginity on a, on a road trip. It's funny. It is funny. Yeah. Marzano in it. James Marsden, he's really funny. Clark Duke. And um, I had a good cast and ah, there it is. Yeah. Wow. Good. Um, but it was a really great experience. It was really fun. And then we, we, we tested it, we did the test screenings and it just murdered, like it was just the, and the studio got really excited. And I thought, oh my God, like I'm going to have a huge career. And then movie came out and didn't do anything I need to do any business at all. It was like, okay, I'm going to go back to Wisconsin and, and not have a career at all. So is it true that instant family, you hired Tom Because Bert Kreischer wasn't available? Yes. The damaged, don't tell me that, man. That's what I heard. Well, and he was asking, he was asking for a lot of money, a lot more than where it is. It's lofty with, it's like he's like, whatever Mark's gets, I want double up. And then they were like, we can't do it.
