Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. A lot of experts out there talking about stuff. That's why a fight like next weekend is so fascinating because between Tony and could be, nobody knows what the fuck is going to happen. It's one of those fights where everybody's like, damn, I don't know. And you got all these people breaking it down on one side and then you've got people making compelling arguments on the other side and you're like, okay, this one's going to be weird. I've been, I've been bouncing back and forth between my pick for that fight. But um, I guess because I've been bouncing back and forth, this isn't necessarily where I'm going to stay, but I feel like, okay, I don't see how that can change. But again, like you said, there are people that are making these arguments and if somebody convinces me of something that kind of defeats this argument, then it's like, man, now you opened the door for this again.

Speaker 1:          00:50          And what I think is like when I first, my first thought was, could be with this guy. He takes everybody down and he controls you and beat you up. Right? And you think he's going to do that? And then, um, but Tony is this guy, he just does not, he's like one of the submission first kind of guys. You know, that argument submission. Our position told me he wasn't even too worried about the position. He'll create scrambles. He's, he's aware of where he is at all times and what he's giving up. So I feel like he would just continue to scramble. He'd be able to get back to his feet at least. Um, and then I go back to Khabib and seeing Tony Against Kevin Lee and Kevin Lee kind of control them early in that fight. You know, he was able to pass his guard and do some, some good controlling things.

Speaker 1:          01:28          Now if a guy like could be, you can do that right then he's not getting back up and could be, he was going to be able to take him now and he is the best wrestler in the game. Like without a doubt. Yeah. Good arguments. Good arguments. You know, I think another argument is it Kevin, when Kevin Lee fought Tony, I think everybody knew Kevin on the staph infection. I knew. I saw him walking to the cage. I look at his chest. I was like, Holy Shit, that guy's got staff. I knew it was going to be weak. I knew in compared to the Kevin Lee, the destroyer that you see when he's on point and in shape, I was like, this guy is going to be compromised. Yeah, and he's also a big one 55 so it's a hard cut for him. Whereas Tony makes it mean Tony can get pretty heavy, but he's super disciplined.

Speaker 1:          02:09          He makes it easy. His endurance, his endurance is off the charts, off the charts impeccable. He was posting the other day that he went on a six six mile run at one o'clock in the morning. It's like extra credit. He wrote Hashtag extra credit. I mean, he's an animal. I mean Eddie Bravo trains with them up there in big bear all the time. He said he's never seen anything like it. So to do is just everybody else like pace and everybody up the hill coming back down. They're still trying to make it up the first time he's running past them. The second time he's a fucking animal. Like aw, he wants it bad. But so he knew that Kevin going into that fight was compromised. So if he knew Kevin was compromised, maybe he decided to just let them work. Let them work that first round. And Kevin's don't know joke.

Speaker 1:          02:50          Kevin's fucking dangerous. Very skilled. Very skilled, very aggressive. Very strong. Very dangerous. You know. So Tony, he got in bad positions in fight though. Did you get mounted in the first round? He is guy got passed. Pretty convinced. Like pretty easily early in the fight. Um, but that's crazy because if, if he, if he did take that time off even knowing that a guy like Kevin Lee was, you know, compromised. That's still a high level guy to be, I'm going to take this time off. It'll be a little bit laxed. Might just have been Kevin. Is that good? I really wish that fight took place with Kevin Healthy. Really wish that fight took place with Kit Kat. I think Kevin is an interesting guy because he's, he talks a lot of shit. Yeah, he's really aggressive. He fights well. He looks the part, when you look at him, he's fucking jacked.

Speaker 1:          03:39          You know, that's a bad break for a dude like that. He had like a golf ball growing out of his tit. Yeah. That was crazy. I mean, it could happen again relatively soon depending on how this fight with, with Barboza goes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's an interesting fight for Barboza to Barboza has got to recover from that. Mauling the can you put on them? That was horrendous. But you know, I'm an opponent Tony. Yeah, exactly. And I want to look back at, um, the bibles to fight, but when I, when I did look at it, he defended, he defended some of those takedowns early, you know what I mean? It's against cubby now. Yes. You can defend, you're going to be the strongest in the first round, but still, um, there's not a lot of people defending it could be his takedowns no. You know, there's a great New York Times article that was us just on, um, like three or four days ago about wrestlers from Dagestan.

Speaker 1:          04:31          Yeah. And about how wrestling is their way out because so many of them trying to prove themselves, they wind up joining those Islamic terrorist groups and uh, that these coaches try to take these young aggressive kids and give them something, something else and give them another alternative, really, really well written article. Interesting stuff about like how powerful these guys are and how young they get him into it. And when you see Khabib, the thing about him, it's like he's not doing different things than everybody else. You know what I mean? Like some people are doing different things like wonder is doing different things. Like he stands totally sideways, his hands are down, he's thrown front leg sidekicks, he's doing a lot of different things and you're like, oh, okay, this is some, a new thing to adjust to Khabib's doing standard shit. But he's just doing it at not just a notch but several notches past what everybody else is doing.

Speaker 1:          05:30          I think that's the thing about these Dagestani guys. Um, it's crazy because like this American wrestling style folkstyle wrestling of being on top and having that control, that's a big deal. But like Nick Lens, that's one of his strengths. Like when nick gets on top of you, it's like a, the Dorf, you know, like he's not going anywhere, but he can also escape that. A lot of guys, same thing with Mike Brown, but um, Nick Lance got written out at the w in, in the fight in Brooklyn. I forget which car that I'm Holly Holmes and Jermaine demand. You know that car he wanted by getting right. No one's lost one, which fight, I forget who, who he fought, I forget he fought a Dagestani guy. Oh, he just got written out against his own style. That's what I'm saying. These guys are better at what they're with the American style is.

Speaker 1:          06:17          But like for something like that, I want to see one of those guys against a guy like Greg Gillespie, you know, cause that style of wrestling of being on top and grinding on you, that's a high, like a high level wrestler like that no fault at four time. All American national champion kind of guy with that kind of conditioning who's not going to break. I want to see that battle. That's like, cause that'll be like a, a national championship with two guys that can punch and kick a bit. Well look at garlic, Jordan Burroughs or Jordan Burroughs getting into MMA. Yeah. Like what happens when he fights when those Dagestani guys. Yeah, exactly. But see there's Dagestani guys and then there's could beep. He's another notch above them. He's a notch above them. Like there's a lot of those guys that are real good. They're real tough, you know.

Speaker 1:          07:02          But he's another level. He is a scary level. I when you see him on top of guys like, like especially the Michael Johnson, that was helpless. That was mauling man, horrifying. And having a conversation with him, pleading with him to give up. You must quit title shot. My title shot. They deserve, just keeps it and he's got his arm tied behind his back. He's punched him in the face. It's horrific. Yeah, it's horrific. I mean he can do shit to you that like, it's like white belt, black belt beat up against the best guy. That world. The best guys in the world. Michael Johnson. Michael Johnson clipped him now. But here's the thing about that fight. It's interesting to me. Could beep came into that fight with the same problem. He went into the Tony Ferguson fight that was canceled. He cut too much weight in his liver, apparently shutdown making wait for that fight.

Speaker 1:          07:51          So then they went into the next fight. Um, and he didn't make weight at all, rushed to the hospital. Then he hires a nutritionist. Looks fucking fantastic. Had been against Barboza, has zero problems making weight now he's got it all under control. But you got to wonder if he was compromised in the Michael Johnson fight. How much of a factor did that play? Is the him getting stunned? Yeah, he got, he got clipped. You got clipped and you know as well as anybody that when you're dehydrated or you have been dehydrated, you just don't take a punch as well. Yeah, yeah. Dehydration, conditioning, those things. You know, those things help you recover when you, when you're hydrated, your conditioning is, is up to par. Um, yeah. I don't know. He, you seen him take some punches. He always backs guys up. He's always coming forward and he does eat a lot of shots coming forward.

Speaker 1:          08:36          But you know, if his conditioning is fine, and that's the only time that I can remember him getting hurt in a fight from taking shots. Like the same thing about both of Barbosa was throwing at him hard, hard, you know, specially Bali. Yeah, just stuff. Everything. Cause he's like a Zombie. He got wheel kicked a couple of times. Nothing club in the back of the head would wheel kicks. Nope. Sorry. Not Today. Just constantly charging forward, man. He's a fucking tank. Terrifying guy. But this is the fight. To me that's the most intriguing. Other than him fighting Conor, him fighting Conor for the name value is like chaos, right? Like Holy Shit. Like they might do that. If he wins, they might do that. Do that. Russia ood if they do that in Russia, Connor better bring his own food. I tell you that. Hey, better bring some fucking corn, beef and cabbage right from the motherland.

Speaker 1:          09:22          You don't want to take any chances. But when Khabib, um, when Khabib's fighting, Tony, the thing about Tony is that Tony so creative, like he's very unpredictable. You don't know what he might step in and throw an upward elbow. You know, he, he, he'll do all kinds of weird shit. He'll do Granby rolls on you. He'll die for a leg. You know, he might try to take Khabib down. Who knows what he's going to do and stand up. He's got legit knockout power, legit and he can take a shot. Rolls with punches real well, doesn't mind. When he gets hit hard, he just kind of rolls with Shit, comes back like the Barboza fight. The Barboza fight with him was a very interesting fight. Yeah. That, that fight was fun to watch. Like I can't, I can't remember all the details right now, but I remember thinking, I remember tweeting, man, I'm watching this and these guys are savages. I, I can't, I can't believe I thought one of these days I have that daddy can steal. It was like, man, I fought them both. But yeah, that fight was fun to watch. And that's, that's that common opponent thing that you say and I don't know. It's one of those things also though, because you know the rule fighter ABC, that thing is a play on like stout beats, like stat Jeremy Stevens beats down. I'd be Jeremy and Jeremy Stout beats me. It's this crazy, crazy thing where it just doesn't add up. It doesn't add up MMA. Math just doesn't work.

Speaker 2:          10:46          Okay.
