Speaker 1:          00:00          I mean, even though the reality is, you know, Facebook is a technology, I'm here that the Facebook friends are going to really hate me for this. But here Facebook is a technology to exploit insecurity for the purpose of selling ads. That's what it does. What it does is make you feel like you've check and you're like, why didn't she like that photograph or why isn't he friended me? And so you constantly engage because you're constantly trying to feed this, you know, feedback. And that is exploiting Tristan. Tristan Harris's work is really a powerful here is exploiting your insecurity and severally what it is. Because I've always thought about it as being a fast food version of the nutrients that we're missing in an actual real community. That's so good. That's exactly the right way to think about it. But just in the same way that fast food companies figure out how to exploit the brain chemistry that makes it so that you eat chicken wings, you know, barbecue chicken wings because they know that's what's going to feed that kind of addiction.

Speaker 1:          00:59          And just like gaming companies figure out how to tweak the game. So that they'd know how to get the addiction out of your kids. This company is really great if by getting you to like turnover as much as you can to them to build you into this quote community. Why are they doing that? Not because Mark Zuckerberg has come some kind of freaky guy who wants to know your secrets, but because the more you turn over to them, the better their ads are in feeding you information. So this is a technology for the purpose of engendering advertising. And so that advertising gets really, really good. And so, you know, you could say that Facebook is tilted to the left, but the reality is there was an extraordinary amount of exploitation of the advertising inside of Facebook to feed information to the right. And this last election, I mean this is what Kathleen Hall Jamieson Book about.

Speaker 1:          01:50          This is really quite amazing and documenting and that's because it's gotten really good at being able to segment markets on the basis of what people know or care about. Again, not because anybody planned it, nobody wrote Jew hater. But because the AI is smart enough to figure that out. And so when you build this technology that is driven to the purpose of making it easier to sell ads, you produce this world that um, you know, has no necessary connection to figuring people, figuring out what the truth is. Again, think of cable television. Cable television is about building really loyal community, building the tribal sense of the community. If telling the truth did that they would tell the truth. If not telling the truth does that they will not tell the truth. And the question is not whether you're telling the truth or not. The question is what builds the advertising base.

Speaker 1:          02:39          And so this, this reality that we have, these platforms that are ad driven, um, distort or constructs drives that platform to develop in certain ways. And that's why I think it's important to think, well, what if we could create a competitive environment where there were different platforms available, ones that we're not focused on, you know, driving ads. And this is something that I get, I think power. They fund those. Isn't that the, the the reason why something like Google or Facebook has gotten so big, it's because there's so much money behind it. Well, two things because they've been allowed to get so big and because so much money behind would stop them. The antitrust departments, you know, the people in antitrust department would step in and say, Facebook, you become too successful. The way you're buying up competitors is disturbing to us. Well, but again, the thing of the difference in that sentence, you become so successful.

Speaker 1:          03:25          That's one sentence. And what we want to do in America encourage companies to become successful. I believe in, you know, innovators and markets working that's really great, but you've bought your competitor is a separate statement. Like you have a bunch of money because the stock is so valuable because people think you're the future of money, but then you turn and use that money to buy a competitors. What are you putting up, Jamie? What is this? That's the total number of they've spent in the last, I, I think it was seven years to sell the companies they bought. Scroll back. Don't, don't move. Okay. Total cost of acquisitions. What does that $23 trillion billion. Billion. $23 billion more than the gross domestic product of a Fiji, Zimbabwe and mild Deeves combined. 19 billion of that was for that one. What's that? Really? Yeah. 19 billion. Holy. Anyway. Yeah. So, but the point is, when you're talking about acquisitions, you're not necessarily talking about companies that are succeeding because they're so good. Right.
