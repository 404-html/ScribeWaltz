Speaker 1:          00:00          When was the most troubled person? Well, that's my defense of Roseanne. You know, all these people were coming after Rosanna. I'm like, you don't understand. She's bad. She's, she's not just batshit. She got in a car accident. He, she had severe brain damage. She's on all sorts of medications. He has multiple personality disorder. She's drinking, she's on Ambien and she's seven years old. What the fuck do you want? Right. What you want from this lady. And you spoke that way. And so did norm, you know, norms talked about Louie and Roseanne and the same way you that like, Yo man, she's bat shit crazy. First of all, if you're going to her for, for, you know, if you're going to her for political discourse, you know my one or you evaluate your light comes on you, that's your fault. Yeah. You, yeah. And that doesn't mean either one of us agree with exactly what you wrote.

Speaker 1:          00:50          It's just how she got there. But that's what also was, she's so funny, you know, if you go back and watch Roseanne in the early days, well that show was fucking heavy. It was a great show. And her standup before, even before. That was fantastic. Yeah. I put her in the top 20 of all time. She was brilliant. She was brilliant. But it's also a monster man. Like there was nobody like her before. Like she was just as brash. I don't give a fuck. She was like a man kill, like, like, uh, like, like a world class stand up. I mean, I remember like when that show came on, just seeing that house, I was, I had never seen a house like that on television. You know what I mean? Closer to what we knew then what I had ever seen. My house didn't look like the Cosbys, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          01:38          I was like, maybe Archie bunker, you know, it was like a little bit closer, but it's when people are batshit crazy and someone reacts to that with confusion, not confusion with contempt. I'm like, you understand their bat shit crazy and it's part of why they got to where they're at. Don't, don't ask surprise now that, that someone said something loony. Yeah. This many years after. You know what I mean? It. It it, it just seems strange to me that now you're blown away. She's been saying batshit crazy shit for a long time. I think it's also part of this new culture that we have in where people just, they find a target and they attack. Of course. It's like if, if you have, if there's any sort of weakness, like if you have chickens and one chicken gets sick, that's what that pecking order thing is. Sean chicken doesn't feel good.

Speaker 1:          02:31          The other chickens, they don't, they don't like make moral judgments on this chicken. They just find a target the site along with that chicken, so they start fucking it up. Right. And this, it happens with dogs. It's a horse. It's an animal thing. It is human beings. We have to, if we're going to be real, if we're gonna, if we're going to be compassionate, we're really going to be compassionate. If we're really gonna like try to engineer a better culture and a better community, we got to stop that. I agree. We've got to just stop attacking people. Like, she didn't, I believe I talked to her on the phone, just me and her. She did not know that lady was black initially. She looked at that lady, she goes, she looked Jewish. She looks like me. She, that's what she said. I believe you. I believe her too.

Speaker 1:          03:16          I think she was just cracking a joke fucked up on ambien short and drinking and smoking weed all night. And, but no one cares what her intent was. All they care is, I got a green light. That's a target we're going to go in. Well, here's my issue with the, the modern, the modern left is, is they talk compassion. But there though they pounce. It's, I feel like a man with no country now too. Cause I don't, I don't, the modern left isn't something that I gravitate towards and neither is the right. And when I was growing up and listening to public enemy, you know, and that left of it, it changed. It changed and I didn't. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you, and you have these people, um, I don't know where I stand anymore, man. I think there's this rational left leaning people that are against discrimination and for welfare and for food.

Speaker 1:          04:19          I look, I was on welfare when I was a kid. If people say I shouldn't be on welfare, well what the fuck? Right. My parents were on, well, no, I came from a poor family. We had food stamps and eventually they did better and we got off of it. But if you want to tell me that, that doesn't help, that fed me. Absolutely. So how could I ever go against that? And that was a part of my childhood. Solutely there's all these things that people want to associate with being, you know, like with the left or right. I think there's just a gigantic problem with people being tribal. That's what it is. It's tribalism at its, at its highest degree, which, and since I've been alive, I haven't seen, never seen it like this for Fords. I think we know why, but, well it's facilitated not just by Trump and, but it's also by the ability to communicate instantaneously, of course, without any consideration. And you could just tweet something or make a youtube video about something instantaneously. Sure. Roseanne's ability to tweet that. Yeah. That quickly with the phone is why Song Kirsch show costs millions of dollars. People lost their jobs. ABC Junk, you know, it's either going to do the Connors, guess what? That show's gonna fucking sink like the titanic. Of course it's going Roseanne. Get the fuck out of here, man. Roseanne without Roseanne, right? Three episodes. That's like flavor free diet. Coke tastes like water and just have water motherfucker.

Speaker 1:          05:44          It's diet coke though, without the flavor. It's true. It's true. And I don't, um, it's just, it's the hypersensitivity and it's like the ability for anyone right or wrong to be able to something right then. Right where you would have, you know, if, if, uh, you're doing fear factor in rolling stone interviews, you, there's a thought process there and, and there's editing and you're sitting there and you're talking with a journalist. All of that's gone, man. It's like it, that's what it's come down to. You know, we have all, all three. It was our phones in our pockets. You can say something crazy right now. If we stubbed our toe right, it's nice, steady job, fuck this, Blah Blah and all of a sudden you're done, your son good in that because the tyranny of these gigantic organizations like if they were tyrannical, if they did have an agenda, if they were trying to smear you, you were fucked.

Speaker 1:          06:36          He had no recourse and they did that. Too many people, I'm sure there's unscrupulous journalists, but also journalistic integrity takes a backseat to, because now they have to get clicks. Like these people are real journalists are fighting for their lives. Absolutely. Cause these publications going under, well real journalism is almost dead. It's not totally dead but it's, it's hurt. But like I was got emphysema like the Alex Jones thing. Right. Whether I agree with shit he says are not corporations shut him down. And that to me that scary that the corporations can decide what we are. Well to hear really well. I was having a good conversation about this last night with some friends and they were talking about whether or not things like youtube or Twitter or Instagram should be regulated like utilities where anybody can use it. You know, like you have the right to get the power.

Speaker 1:          07:32          Like if you have, if you have a house, you're, you have the right to, you pay your money, you get your power turned on. It's a utility. Maybe a channel like that, whether it's a youtube or whether it's Twitter, maybe a channel should be treated like a utility, but then the question is like, what is it exactly that is good enough to get you kicked off? Because I've seen some horrible shit. People have read or written rather on Twitter that, and they're still on, right. I've seen shit, whatever. He's being a whatever, you know, this is why he was brought down. I've seen people say much worse shit thing was the sandy hook and it was that the sandy hook thing was he said that he thought that it was fake. He's since disavowed that, but they don't care if you disavow things. It's like they have this thing on you now.

Speaker 1:          08:22          You said that the kids didn't die. They definitely did. Let's get rid of you. But are you saying that people aren't allowed to make mistakes? Are you saying that people aren't allowed to evolve their thinking? Are you saying that people aren't allowed to say things that are wrong because a lot of people say things in a wrong, but is it only things that are wrong about children? Like where, what does the line, I don't know where lines are anymore and I don't know who's the one drawing. Well, it's these people that either are the CEOs or the stockholders or the CFO's, whoever it is that, that is in the meeting dictating these standards. They're deciding, and these are gigantic corporations that we were just talking about this. I don't think they ever anticipated this. I think when they made Twitter they thought it'd be, like Jamie was saying, it was a fun way to like tell your friends, you know, uh, you know, Vinny pads and Joe Rogan to go into the movies and that's what you would do. That's what Twitter was. It was just like, I'm at, I'm, I'm eating pizza at the mall. Yeah. It wasn't anything crazy. And then people started using as a platform for, I don't know what, uh, you know, Vinny pads and Joe Rogan to go into the movies and that's what you would do if that's what Twitter was. It was just like, I'm at, I'm, I'm eating pizza at the mall. Yeah. It wasn't anything crazy. And then people started using as a platform for, I don't know why.
