Speaker 1:          00:00          What are my limits, what are our limits collectively and can my physical expression of this inspire other people to innovate, create and do amazing things in the world and in and other modalities and canvases?

Speaker 2:          00:10          Well, that's one of the weird things about people doing extraordinary things like what you did is that you absolutely will give other people fuel to accomplish things in their life. Inspiration is so critical for human beings. I mean, I draw upon it from so many different sources from David Goggins and a bunch of my other friends, my friend Cameron Hanes, and a lot of other people that are endurance athletes and different people that I've interviewed on this podcast. But there's something that happens when you realize that people can do extraordinary things. It makes you believe in the potential, not just in that person, but also in yourself.

Speaker 1:          00:47          Absolutely. I mean, you know, God is a great example of that. I've never met him, but I know I've personally derived inspiration from that guy. I mean, he gets out there, you know, you can't run a hundred miles. Like I'll show you like I run a hundred miles. You know, and he's pushing his by two extreme ways or you know, I love what he says about the 40% you know, I think about it a little bit different in my mind, but like what are those limits? I don't know if it's 40% or 80% people quit. You know, people quit that I can't. Voice comes up and you know, he's proven it. So as many other people have actually, when you say I can actually, when you don't stop, you get stronger. And for me in my own story and my own journey, I think that final day that finally final 32 hour push proves it three days before that, you know, I'm videotaping all of this.

Speaker 1:          01:26          I'm trying to capture as much content to be able to share with people of this crazy weird place that's an article by yourself. And like day 49 day 40 50 like I'm literally crying into my goal Probean like I'm running out of food, I'm exhausted. I don't know if I can keep doing this. I'm just like worked. Right? But sure enough, I don't say I can't, you know, it's that for it was that 40% was that 50% that's that moment when I wanted to quit or I should have quit. But then the strongest, most amazing moment of my entire athletic career that spans decades happens three days later because I kept pushing. It's not like I rested for three days and pulled that off. Like I never took a rest day in 54 days. I pulled my sled 12 to 13 hours every single day and on the last day it was the strongest as possible.

Speaker 1:          02:06          So I think it proves if we can push through that, I can't moment, no, it's not going to work. That you can get there. And unfortunately, you know, we talk about 40% with Goggins. I actually think a lot of people quit at 1% they're sitting behind their office, they're like, you know, one day I want to travel overseas, or you know, I hate this job. You know, I've got this great business idea. But I mean, they're like, but I can't, like I've got no money to start this business. I've gotten no, this like when I first set off my first world record in 2016 2014 I sat with Jenna in my house, one bedroom apartment with a whiteboard and we're like, I'm going to see if I can set the world record for the explorer's Grand Slam. Something fewer than 50 people in the world have ever done and I'm going to be the fastest climb Everest come to now like climb Kilimanjaro, North Pole, South Pole, back to back.

Speaker 1:          02:45          I hadn't climbed a bunch of mountains. Be Pretty easy to say I can't. Oh and by the way, we have no money to do this. We have no platform. I have like 200 Instagram followers. Like, I mean I have nothing but we just sat there and like no. Instead of saying I can't, let's say I can't, what's the first to that? We literally get out our laptops and I'm like going to like, we're like, we want to build this big media campaign where lots of people follow and get pressed. Like we know nothing about. We have no background this week. Google. What's the difference between marketing and PR? I mean we are literally asking, Google don't most basic of all basic questions. Oh, but you know, we, we continue to say like, let's get coffee with our one friend who knows something about this. We should probably get a website.

Speaker 1:          03:25          How does one build a website? And it goes on and on like this. How long ago did you start this journey? So that, that was 24 when we, 2014 when we dream that up. This will, the world record was just the fact that years ago. Yeah. So to see if I could set the world record for something called the explorer's Grand Slam. So let's come and tallest mountain on each of the seven continents, seven summits. And before that, had you done anything like that or did it just been athletics? So I grew up in Portland, so I grew up like in the outdoors, but like I mean to go climb Everest at Denali sort of thing. No, the short answer is I'm going to climb a few mountains. You know, I, it's not like I'd never been in the snow before. I'd worn crampons ice that's like, and I had zero experience, but like not even close to the experience that you would think one would need to do that and to just break world records, not just do it, but like be the fastest person to ever complete it.

Speaker 1:          04:07          You know, like I said, it ended up being a hunter in 39 days straight through to climb all those mountains. Didn't know, I think we had a clip up a second ago if something on Everest, but uh, but yeah, I mean to do, to do all of that, it started from this place of not, of, of, of uh, believing I can. And then, you know, it's, again, it's fun to talk about the epic adventure, but be, for me it's actually fun to talk about what happened behind the scenes of that because what actually happened, like people applaud our success. Now this is me. This is you. Everest walking across the ladder. That's, you know, about 300 foot hole a crevasse, uh, on the other side of it that you have to go through to on your way up the, uh, the Mount Everest climbing route. And so your crampons or clicking on the, on the, you're hooking them on the ladder as you walk across and if you fall you die.

Speaker 1:          04:51          Yes. Okay. So that man, watch this again. This is so awful. It's so awful. Look at, cause you're, you're basically just walking this tight rope on. Let me hear it. Listen to that click folks, I implore you to go to the Instagram page so you get the full freak out cramp. The consoles, they're tied together to those ladders. Yeah. Ty [inaudible] is compete the 300 foot cavern over there. Oh fuck. All of this. She's a us. Oh, and you're looking down, cause you ever go on and we cut the sound off at the Ed there, but I go at the bear and I go because like there's 50 of those letters, but I was cheering every fucking time I got cross. I was like, yeah, one more down. Woo. 50 Times in the Khumbu I slash should go through that section a couple of times. It's a very dangerous section of the mountain.

Speaker 1:          05:44          Um, but yeah, I went about 50 of those ladders. So when you went through Everest, did you see the bodies? Um, so I fortunately didn't see any bodies up there. Fortunately or unfortunately, fortunately. I mean, I mean I'm not like trying to see that bias, you know, but they're, they're more prevalent on the climbing around on the north side. The day that I did summit, um, three people died, uh, on the day that I summited. So when I, yeah, when I, so the set, the, I mean, talk about Evers, I mean for me is a major setbacks. It was the eighth of nine expeditions in this sequence. So I'd done a hundred days of other expeditions leading up to Everest to do this explorer's grand slam world record. I'm trying to climb Everest. I'm exhausted from a hundred days. I just come from the North Pole before that Kilimanjaro. Before that, you know, Albert's all these other mountains.

Speaker 1:          06:25          And then I make my summit push on Everest. I'm not climbing with a guide or anything, it's just myself and one Sherpa who I met climbing in Nepal the year previous when I was training for this. And so it's just the two of us and we climb up into camp for so ever says, you know for camps there's base camp and then there's camps progressively higher in the mountains so you can get your body a climatize and we get up into camp for, have you read the book into thin air by Jon Krakauer? Anything about it? Say, okay, there's a famous book that's written about it. We're 11 people die and right in this moment it's called the death zone where you enter above 26,000 feet. The human body basically can't survive for long, even with supplemental oxygen and this massive snow storm and wind storm blows in like kind of out of nowhere.

Speaker 1:          07:00          And we're just trying to push for the summit. It takes us two and a half hours just to set up our tent and get inside and we know like it's over. Like we're not, we're not going to summit Everest like in this storm. There's no way. So we just survive the night, wake up the next morning, still getting pounded by this weather and actually have to climb back down the mountain. So climb back down the mountain all the way to camp two. And they're looking, they're like, well that's probably it. Like you don't usually like spend a night out in the death zone and like make a second attempt and you've already tried all these other mountains. You're a hundred plus days in this journey. And I was like, man, I want to see if I can get back up there. Like, and this other guy who I met on another team had some supplemental oxygen.

Speaker 1:          07:34          So I had to use some of my supplement auction. So my supplies tours are limited now as well. And so he, uh, he says to me, Hey, I'm not going to go up. I'm sick. But if you get back up to camp four, there's a couple of bottles of oxygen that, um, you could use of mine if you, if you somehow get back up there. So sure enough per sang [inaudible] name of the shirt palace, common with amazing climber himself. We get back up to camp four and the death zone. And uh, we decided we're going to go for the summit and we call back down to base camp. What's the weather forecast? And they're like, well, it's the exact same forecast we told you before. It might hold, in which case there'll be fine or it might turn into what you guys just survive. And if you're not near your tent and you're up on the summit ridge of Everest, like it's going to get like pretty bad.

Speaker 1:          08:14          And so we kind of go back and forth. Should we go for it? Shouldn't we go for it? We just decided to go for it. But this crazy thing happens, which is, you may have read about this or heard of this if you know much about ever is, but basically no one climbed Everest in 2014 or 15 cars. A huge avalanche killed 16 shorters in 2014 that the mountain was closed in 2015. There was a huge earthquake in Nepal that shut the climbing season down. So no one's even climb the mountain in two years, but all of a sudden because of these weather delays, I ended up there and there's a hundred people going for the summit on the exact same day. So basically traffic jam on the worst fucking place to feed a traffic jam possible. So Sang Bodie and I would go, okay, let's figure out how to climb this thing.

Speaker 1:          08:51          And we leave camp. I, you know, there's a photo that I took for leaving camp. There's all these lights up the side of the mountain and it's because there's one rope that everyone works to put in. So everyone's using the same rope and all of a sudden we're behind a hundred people. And if you stand there, wind chill minus 40 degrees. Like we're going to get frostbite, like we're going to not be able to make it. And so Passaic Bodie and I look at each term ago, let's unclipped from the rope. And so we actually decided to, we actually decided to unclip from the rope, climb up all the way to the balcony from the, the south call. The death zone area was mentioning before, um, up to about 28,000 feet on rope because we actually think it's more dangerous to climb roped next to all the behind all the people than it is to risk of fall.

Speaker 1:          09:32          You don't know those people. They're like, and people work. I mean, you're on Everest at 28,000 feet and people are walking, I mean, one step per minute sometimes. I mean, it's, it is brutal. And so, I mean, I'm walking maybe two steps every 30 seconds, but I'm like you saying bolt like pasties people. Yeah. This is, this gives an example of like, so you're in it like the world, the worst place in the world to be. You know, it, uh, in a traffic jam. As you can see here for this photo, I posted, uh, that day. Um, but anyways, I get up to this edge and it finally, it's too steep. It's too dangerous for us to be unclipped from the rope any longer. And we're like, we're just going to have to clip in and settle in behind. You know, we'd pass like 50 or 60 people, so we're in much better place than ever.

Speaker 1:          10:11          I still have this one big puffy coat has actually the same puffy coat. I used an Antarctica, the big like Michelin man coat and I'm like, we're going to slow down. I better put this big jacket on. And so I take my jacket off, I undo my gloves real quick to put this big jacket on over me to warm myself up. And I looked down and my right hand is black, like just black is black, can be. And I'm like Holy Shit. Like telltale sign of frostbite, like Oh my God. Like it's same thing. We've got school kids bowling alone, got family fun, the whole thing. And I'm like, oh my God, like I'm going to route lose. My right hand is Jenice still gonna love me. You know, what's my family going to think? And then I don't say anything to put Sang Bodie. I jammed my hand back in this big gloves and I go, okay, and I don't, I don't recommend this thought process, but I go, well if I'm going to lose my hand anyways, wouldn't it be cooler to lose my hand but also have summited Everest.

Speaker 1:          11:02          So how black was it? I mean it was black, like black, black. So yes, it was black. Did you take a picture of it? So, so the sun had was just still, the sun was just below the horizon. So it's like dusk and I looked down at this point and then the sun comes up. So I jammed my hand back in this club and I don't say anything to present bone in, like let's keep pushing for the summit. So we go for the next three hours and the whole time I'm on I'm like, Oh my God, I'm such an idiot. Like I'm going to lose my hand, my hand's frostbit and this and that. And so we get up and we're about 30 minutes blow Mount Everest summit and should be a beautiful moment for me. Like since a little kid I dream like summiting efforts would be like the greatest accomplishment of my life.

Speaker 1:          11:37          Oh my God. And I'm thinking like just in this dark place, but also haven't taken a single photo basically. And I'm like, well I got to get like a photo or a video of, you know, the famous Mount Everest summit. So I pull up my GoPro to shoot a video. I shoot this short little video, which kind of shows this crazy exposure that I'm on one side, 5,000 feet down into China on one side, 5,000 feet in Nepal and this tiny little knife edge ridge. And of course I have to adjust my gloves again, this is from the summit and I pull my, I pull my GoPro out, I have to mess with my gloves, put it back in and I look at my hand and I started going away from my arms in the air, go per se,

Speaker 3:          12:13          Bodie, my handbag

Speaker 1:          12:16          back. And he's like, what are you doing? It just so happened that the, the glove warmers in my of clubs, the chemical hand warmers had broken open and the charcoal. And the copper filings of the chemical hand warmers had tied my hand flack. Oh Geez. I was completely fine. Oh God. So yeah, this could peer if you play it from the top is me reaching the summit. That's the SAG Bodie right there. But uh, so when

Speaker 1:          12:45          I'm on the summit of Mount Everest, top of the world, no words can describe. Wow. So what did you experience any discomfort in your hands forward? So you're, again, we're talking about a lot of this, this podcasts, bit about mindset, which is one of my favorite topics. And like, just like we said, you can convince yourself that the salt man is fixing your foot. Like I'm on Everest, I'm at 28,000 feet. My brain's not working very well. I know that the weather's coming in bad, that people are going to get maybe frostbite based on the forecast. And I looked down and I see my hands black. Where does my mind go? It's like, it's not like, Oh let me think about this. My hand warmer must've broken open in this. I'm like my hand. And it was weird cause I was like, I didn't feel my hand getting cold.

Speaker 1:          13:31          My hand, like it was fine, but I'm on Everest, my hands black. That means, you know, in my brain I'm like, I have frostbite. So it's just like, it's a weird thing where you can take your mind. Like a lot of this, the positivity, this, my mom went to the negative immediately. Like your hands gone. It's frozen off like the end. Um, so what'll happen to the people that died? Were they on the rope? Yeah, so unfortunately that day the weather actually did get pretty bad later in the day. So fortunate I was able to get down before the weather got too bad. Um, but uh, the people that died that day, uh, one slipped and fell down these ropes over on Lhotse, which is the adjacent mountain, but similar sit sharing some of the same ropes on the same route. Um, and then two people died from altitude sickness.

Speaker 1:          14:10          So basically either running out of oxygen up there and not be on to get back down to their tent. I think those people actually did get carried back down to their tents that night and then died in the tent that night. Some it's called cerebral edema. Um, which is basically your brain fills with fluid from being at the high altitude and not getting enough oxygen. And it's a, it's a killer up there. And you know, one of the crazy things about being up there is, you know, you read about it but you really can't rescue somebody very easily up there. I mean, tick to carry a human body down into the rescue them is, is nearly impossible. And I kind of always thought in my mind, you know, if I saw somebody lying on the ground, like I would, you know, summon the energy to pick them up.

Speaker 1:          14:45          And I was actually coming back from the summit and I was on the South Summit. So just below the effort, some inner at 28,000, 800 feet or something like that. And this Brazilian woman who I'd met in base camp, um, named Tyce who I've become friends with your in Nepal for a couple of months you start talking to people, getting friends with other climbers, whatever. And I see her lying on the ground with our head, like leaned back in her oxygen mask off to the side and I'm like, oh my God. Like this is the moment that I'm most feared. Like somebody who I know is lying here on the side of the mountain and I think to myself, I've got to pick her up, I've got to pick her up and somehow like carry her down this mountain and I lean over to grab her and I try with all my might to do anything and I realized I can't move her six inches.

Speaker 1:          15:25          Like I'm completely exhausted. Muscles aren't working. Brain's not working. So I do. The only thing I can think to do is I just wrapped her in my arms and I say Tice like if you can hear me, it's calling. You need to get up, you need to get your oxygen mask on, you need to start moving. Like please get up, please get up. No response. She was climbing with a Sherpa, another guide right next to her and they were like, look like we're having trouble with her oxygen mask, but we're going to fix it like it's gonna be all right. And I was like, just kind of going through this intense moment, Mike, what do I do? How can I help? And it's this weird, as you know, I, I'm not proud of it necessarily to say it, but like there was nothing I could do like a, it's just the most helpless feeling in the world where you want to help the common person.

Speaker 1:          16:02          You afraid, I mean, this person, I'd be a friend, but if any human being is lying on the ground in the snow, you're like, I want to help this person get down this mountain. And I was just on so close to, on my limit up there, the summit, there was nothing I could do. Fortunately. Um, she was not one of the people that passed away that day. Her, her team did get her oxygen mask on her and she actually made it to the summit and back down safely. She went up, she ended up going up from there, which to me is like another whole crazy part of that story. But it was an interesting lesson for me in like, you know, you hear these stories, you can't move bodies up there. There's nothing you can do the rescue. And people have been criticized for not, you know, doing these crazy rescues when things have gone wrong up there.

Speaker 1:          16:38          But it really hit home for me, like how, how hard it would be to move somebody down that mountain from that altitude. And so when you're up there, you know, unlike, you know, Antarctica, I was actually alone in Everest. Like I said, it was pretty crowded day. Like you're essentially alone up there. Like if you can't keep putting one foot in front of the other up in the death zone, there's not, not a whole lot that you can do. Um, so the three people that died up there, did they leave them there? Um, I'm not sure with those specific people because sometimes they, you can get like a large team of people to slowly lower people down. You know, in a weird way it's actually easier to lower a dead body than it is to lower a live person because it dead body, you don't have to worry about breaking bones and things like that if you're lowing someone over rocks and things like that.

Speaker 1:          17:19          So I actually believe those bodies are no longer there. But there are quite a few bodies, you know, still on the mountain in particularly the north side, the Chinese, so you can climb it from two sides. The Nepal side, which is more commonly climb where I climbed the Tibet side, the Tibet side is known for having a lot more of, the body's still actually on the climbing route for sure. So, but for me on that, I mean that day in a crazy way continues on because I got back down to camp four and I'm thinking I'm going to sleep for the night rest and come back down. The mountain usually takes a few days to get back down the, at this point, you know, I've only got one more mountain to climb to come finish my world record the explorer's Grand Slam and I was about two months ahead of schedule.

Speaker 1:          17:56          So if I had climbed Denali in the next two months, North America's tallest mountain up in Alaska, I was going to set this world, this world record that I was. And so I called back home to Jenna and I was like, I made it like I made it. And uh, earlier in the day when my hands had gotten frozen, I had actually had a heated boot warmers. And so I turned the heat in, my boot warmers up as hot as possible. So I'm like, if my hand is prospecting, what got my feet look like? So I crank those up as hot as possible. And so Jen is like, hey, like how are you doing? Like you all right. We've heard some reports over social media that has been a really hard day up there. Like, I'm like, yeah, I'm a right, like no frostbite, no injuries, like I'm good.

Speaker 1:          18:31          And I was like, well actually, um, I, uh, I burned my feet and she's like, oh, frostbite. Like how bad is it? And I was like, no, not frostbite. I actually burned too, like silver dollars circles in the bottom to both of my feet from turning my boot warmers up too much. And she's like, wait, let me get this straight. Like you climb Everest, you don't get frostbite, but you burn yourself. She was like, you, your feet fire. Like justice is a bad situation. Um, but then she goes on and she was like, she literally said the next thing you to me, I will literally never forget in my life. But she goes, so you're in your tent, right? You took your boots off and everything. You're curled up in there. I'm like, yeah. And she's like, well, uh, I actually need you to put your boots back on.

Speaker 1:          19:11          And I'm like, excuse me? Like I just what? Like she was like, yeah. So we've been doing some calculating back home and it just so happens that if you can get to the summit of Denali in the next, uh, week, you can set, not one, but two world records. And I was like, well, that sounds nice. But like I'm on the summit of below the summit of Everest. How the hell is that going to work? She's like, okay, put your boots back on down. Now climb all the way back to base camp. There's no time for you to sleep. But then a helicopter is going to take you to Katmandu. No time for a hotel, no time for a shower. But an evening flight is going to take you to Dubai, to Seattle, to anchorage. And instead of having three weeks to climb Denali, you'll have three days.

Speaker 1:          19:46          But if you can do all of that, you'll set another world record like ready, go. Oh. So I was in disbelief, but uh, no one better than to disobey. Not only my amazing wife, but the planner and logistics expert in running the backend. All of this, I assure enough, put my boots back on, wipe the slate clean, and found myself, um, you know, just a hundred hours after standing on the summit of Everest, I found myself over in Alaska trying to push up to the summit to, uh, to try to set the two world records and not just the one.
