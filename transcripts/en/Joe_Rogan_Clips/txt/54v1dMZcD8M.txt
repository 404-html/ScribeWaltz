Speaker 1:          00:00          You know, like to say that you've never dated anybody who's over six foot five, well, you're tall phobic. Right. That's, that's a ridiculous statement. That doesn't make any sense. You know, to say that you've, uh, you've never dated anybody that weighs more than 300 pounds. You, you know, you're a, you're a mass phobic. That's ridiculous too. Yeah. It's just all of it's stupid. It's all stupid people telling him. But this, what they're doing is, it's a bunch of people that are pushing this idea of being open entirely open to all things trans, that you as a heterosexual person should not just recognize that this is a woman because they chance for furred from a of male to a female, but recognize even if they haven't transferred and recognize them in terms of sexual selection in terms of a date. Right. And that's just fucking stupid because you can decide, right?

Speaker 1:          00:48          You're not into certain things. Like I'm not really into girls with short hair. You could decide that it's not my thing. I don't like girls with shaved heads. I don't find it attractive. Like a woman can say that too. I don't like guys are creepy mustaches and nobody gets mad at him. But if a man says to certain people, I'm not in to chicks with Dicks, then that guy's a piece of shit. Or what about, there's a thing called sexual racism where you specifically, you know, I'm not attracted to a particular, you know, I don't like Asian men. I don't like black women. Right. You're not supposed to instantiate those sexual preferences. If the racial queue is the one that's causing you to either be attracted or not attach to someone, what do you think of that? Um, well, there's certainly beautiful people of all race, so that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me in terms of the person selection.

Speaker 1:          01:42          Like if you tell me you've never seen a beautiful black woman, right? Like you crazy. Like you have met enough black women. If you tell me 17 a beautiful Asian woman, like what? What are you saying? Like there's beautiful people in and there's also, you should be allowed to, to be with whoever you want in terms of not, but why is it, it's always sex, right? Because like obnoxious people. Here's the perfect example. I don't like friends that are loud and get drunk in public. Oh, what are you drunk phobic? No, I just don't enjoy that. So like in terms of sexual selection, that's on the dates. I tell you why that analogy might fail. And some of the progressive's you could alter your level of obnoxious snus. You could grow out of your boxes as well. I know some people conceivably, theoretically, I know some people are fucked.

Speaker 1:          02:28          That's just who they are. Fair enough. Or you want to name any names? No, but your race is a immutable part of you. Okay. That's the perspective. I see that. I mean I'm, I'm playing devil's advocate. I'm not, I'm not agreeing with it. Okay. Well what about a tall versus short? Right? You know what, if you're a woman volleyball player and you're six foot three and you don't want to date a guy was five feet tall, you know, are you, what are you, what are you, by the way, that is one of the biggest problems of being a very tall woman because one of the, one of the, so there's something called assorted of mating and evolutionary theory sort of mating is basically birds of

Speaker 2:          03:00          a feather flock together. And that's very much the mechanism that drives may choice much more than opposites attract. So one of the sorts of mating cues that people most assault on his height. So it's not so much that women want guys that are only six foot or taller, it's just that the woman wants a guy who's taller than her. So if you look at the, there is a study that I've discussed in the past, uh, that looked at something like 720 actual couples. And I think there was only a single one out of the 720 where the woman was taller than the man. Now once a woman gets to be over a certain height, she's six foot two, six foot three, her potential pool of prospective suitors really shrinks. And so if you have a daughter, you really want to pray that she doesn't get too tall because boy are her choices going to be limited because few women want to date the shorter guy than them.

Speaker 2:          03:49          Yeah. When you're at six foot three, six foot four woman, that's gotta be a tough spot. You're basically relegated to big athletes are big exact people. And the, the nick, the other place where you get this sort of a sort of May thing is where you get women who are super educated, uh, that makes sense. The exact same thing happens. The more educated a woman gets, the worse her marriage prospects because the more sophisticated women are, the more they insist on a high status male. And therefore, as I get more educated as a woman, there are just fewer men who are as educated or more than me, and therefore I'm doomed to a life of solitude. That totally makes sense. That totally makes sense. Especially considering that men, you know, in general they get insecure around women who are more successful and more educated or more intelligent.

Speaker 2:          04:42          Like very rarely are men comfortable with a woman who has to explain things to them. Absolutely. Yeah. By the way, I think I have another theory which I'd like to at some point test, maybe someone will steal it now. So when you have a couple that gets married very young, they are judging one another based on their mate value at 18 or 19 right. So Tony is the high school quarterback and so he's the hot guy and I'm the cheerleader and then later he stagnates. He doesn't go on with his career. Whereas I go on and become a physician. I am a cheerleader. So at 29 there is not a huge inequity between our two mating values on the mating market. Right. So when we were both 19 the fact that we had roughly the same may think value made us a very attractive, stable couple.

Speaker 2:          05:29          But Tony turned out to be a fucking loser. Exactly. He's a lame duck. Exactly. And so I so I have a theory that, and I'd like to at some point tested maybe some graduate student will write to me saying that I'll work with this on you. The doctor side, I have a theory whereby I think that in many cases where people end up divorcing when they married young, it's precisely because that which started as equitable mating values at time t zero turned out to have huge in our trajectory on the mating market and that puts a huge strain on the marriage, especially when the wife status is going up. That the best way to ensure that the marriage ends as for the status of the woman to keep going up and that of the man to either stagnate or go down, that's going to be

Speaker 1:          06:15          doomed. That makes sense. It May. It makes sense that also, you know, obviously the young marriages are rough because people grow and they don't necessarily grow together. We you catch people 10 years later and they're oftentimes radically different people. Right. But then there's also the thing that women don't seem to, for the most part, respect a man is not doing as well as them. Right? You, that's a, that's a giant issue. Even if the guy's doing okay, like say if your guys making $50,000 a year, that's a very good living. He's out there doing well, but you make 300 let me 300 grand a year and this fucking losers over here with his 50 grand, like you're kicking ass. You'll like some big wig at some big corporation like that. That seems to be a real sticking point. And with men, especially if they have a household where they contribute income together, they, they pile all the income and the man starts spending the woman's money on stuff. You know, he starts buying stuff. You've got a new fishing rod and what did you get that with your money or my money. You know, it gets weird. Right?

Speaker 2:          07:18          And incidentally, uh, so speaking of say, consumer psychology stuff that I study, when you take a very rich woman and you go out on a date with her, even though she obviously can afford the dinner and she can afford anything that you're going to buy her, if you exhibit cues of frugality, cheapness, that's the perfect way to ensure that you won't have a second date. So it's not so much a question of uh, you know, it's an old sexist, the ritual whereby men were wooing women. It really is an honest signal of your commitment to, to a woman. So the best way, and I get many of these letters where people ask me, hey professor, what are you, you know, you know, dating advice. Well you do have to exhibit generosity when you go out with that, I mean, nuptial gift giving them, she'll give, giving.

Speaker 2:          08:04          Is it sort of the fancy term for courtship rituals across animal species? So many species, you have typically the male engaging in some form of courtship gift giving and depending on the quality of the gift, will determine whether the female will mate with your not while so much of what we do in marketing context is exactly that, right? It's the exact same phenomenon repeating itself in the human context, right? Uh, uh, engagement rings, right? The fact that you are supposed to spend a quarter of your yearly salary on this rock, is that really what it is? Yeah, that's what I'm, I don't know if everybody meets it, but that's right. It is that right? It's three months. Exactly. God, when you say a quarter of the yearly salary, it makes you just go, what in the fuck is wrong with people? But there is so much money, but here's the, but here's the reason.

Speaker 2:          08:54          Here's the reason you ready? It's, it's what's called is the Javian signal. I don't know if I've ever discussed this in this, in this podcast is a Javian signal is basically the idea that for a signal, to be honest, it has to be costly. Otherwise everybody could imitate it. Right? So, so think about, for example, rites of passage in different cultures, right? If you want to demonstrate that you're a top warrior, the rite of passage has to be brutal. Otherwise, if it's only, we all have to do five setups than every male could do it. And then the females can determine the pretenders from the real guys, right? So you have, for example, bullet ant, do you know this one through, right? You put your hands through, right? I mean, that takes a lot of courage and capacity to, people don't know what we're talking about.

Speaker 2:          09:38          So this is a tribe in the Amazon whereby you take the bullet, ant is supposedly the, the biggest purveyor of pain that is humanly possible that you could experience. My friend Steve gets done by one, did it and what did, he was in Bolivia, I believe. And uh, he got stung and uh, in his heel, got them in the heel and he said it was just, he was delirious. What's happening? He said it lasts for a few hours, then it goes away. Right? So what they do in this tribe is they take a bunch of these ants in the order of a couple of hundred. One is enough to cause you agonizing, impossible, delirious pain. And they said, date them through this compound. Uh, and then they enter, weave them in these gloves, these a leaf gloves so that when they're coming to, they come out of their stupor and you have your hands in there, they start viciously biting you, stinging you, and you're supposed to withstand that pain without screaming.

Speaker 2:          10:40          You have to take it. And so you sort of almost go into this religious fervor, this kind of uh, incantation. And you have to do that ritual, 20 separate occasions, the tech 20 different times on different days, 2020, before you are admitted into the tribe of Warriors, whatever. Well now let's think of back to the engagement ring, right? If all it takes for me to convince you of my honest intentions is to buy you flowers. And now let's go back behind the shed and you know, have sex. Well then a lot of cheaters are going to convince you of doing this when they really didn't have good intentions. But if it takes for me to spend a quarter of my salary to convince you that I have on us, so therefore, this is a form of what's called as a hobby and signaling because the Harvey was a Israeli ornithologists that studied this type of behavior, this costly signaling behavior using Arabian babblers, which is a type of bird.

Speaker 2:          11:35          So here's another example of as a hobby and signal, uh, you probably have seen this, uh, when you have a Predator, uh, that's looking at who to attack, you often will have gazelles starting to actually make themselves conspicuously visible to the Predator. They come close him, they start jumping from, have you ever seen this gentleman, and I think it's called stroking, not strutting. And can you think why that would be? Like, why are they not hiding? Why are they not making themselves? Uh, in conspicuous. Why? Why are they drawing attention to themselves when they are 50 different gazelles that the Predator could be pointing to? Why? Well, because what it's, what, what that animal is saying is the fact that I could stand here in front of you and jump up and down and make myself this visible suggests that it's probably a lost cause for you to try to go after me.

Speaker 2:          12:31          I'm super fit. Right? It's a costly signal of my fitness. It's an honest signal, right? The one who is not doing this behavior is the one that you should be paying attention to. Ah, so this is called, and so I use this principle of as a hobby and signaling to explain things like conspicuous consumption, right? The reason why you buy the fancy car that the other males can't hope to purchase, it's precisely because they can't afford to match your signal. Therefore, it's an honest signal. The reason why I buy $100 million painting that a monkey could have drawn shows how wealthy I am, that I could waste $100 million.

Speaker 1:          13:13          Ah, that makes sense. That makes sense. It's all just meeting stuff. It's mating and food. You don't want to become somebody dinner. You want to find dinner and you want to have sex. Good night everybody. Yeah. Those signals are so fascinating when we see them in our culture and people get angry at them. Like you see some guy pull up in a Ferrari and you go look at this fucking loser with as Little Duke, right? You're like maybe or maybe a guy with a shit load of money wants to let the world know cause he likes to fuck you.

Speaker 2:          13:45          Right. I've shared actually on this show, I think the stories about my, one of my brother's who was a big car collector, three Ferrari's, Aston Martin Ligand, and I've even shared a story which I'm happy to repeat, uh, of we would go to nightclubs where he's this, this is the Olympia and this is the five foot three guy. And we would go to nightclubs and he would pick the most beautiful woman and approach her even though she's accompanied by six foot four, you know, tough fucking guy. And he had that confidence. I think because he had that wealth catapulting him,

Speaker 1:          14:20          he certainly helps. It certainly helps. Yeah. It's um, it is a weird ever prevalent aspect in the communication between men and females is how much money does the man have? Right. I mean, and this is one thing that a lot of women hate because they don't want to feel like they could be purchased and they can't. They can't. They can't. Some can write a lot, Ken. It's a factor. It's a big fee and a lot of women are very rare, rabidly ruthlessly independent. They don't want that ever in their life and good for them. But, but the reality is it's a very effective strategy. You pull up in that Ferrari or that Rolls Royce or whatever the fuck you're driving and it has a big impact and you get to that nightclub.

Speaker 2:          15:07          And those studies have been done endless sea and psychology. So here's one example and you don't need to have a signal as big as a Ferrari. Just how you dress in terms of the status that is exhibited to, there's a study that was done I think in the early nineties, where they manipulated the status, the, it's the sartorial, the attire of men and women into one of three different types, you know, high status medium and you know, some tee shirt or Mcdonald's uniform, whatever. And then they asked men and women, uh, one of six possible, you know, would you go out on a w for coffee with this guy? Would you go out on dinner? Would you have sex with him? Would you marry him? And across all six levels of relationships, the status of the attire of a man had a profound effect on the likelihood of the woman saying, yes, hire the status. The more likely she said yes. That same manipulation on women had zero effect on men and other words no man has ever uttered the following words. Words, my God, you've got a juicy but, and I'd love to have sex with you, but you're not exhibiting cues of ambition, therefore no sex for you, Linda. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          16:16          that's a, that's a reality. That's a reality that people are very uncomfortable with and I don't think women necessarily are craving the same reaction from men because of their ambition. I don't think women are ever sang through my ambition. I'm going to get a good man. Right. You know that just, it's just not a factor, but they do say through my I ambition, I'm never going to need a map. True. That's because that's because, look, there's the reality is there's a lot of shitty human beings out there and some of them have penises and if you're a woman and you run into too many of those or for buy for whatever reason, because of your environment, because of your behavior, because of the circles you travel in your around too many of them, a large dating pool of shitheads out there. You know, you just say, I don't want this in my life. I want, I don't want to be like my mom. I don't want to be like my sister. I want to be independent. But what you're not saying is, I am going to get a or house and a baller car and I'm going to get me a man. And the only woman that I know of that I've ever heard say that is disgusting and the only woman that I ever, she's like, you know, talking about her success and our success allows her to get men. She's a foul beast. Loud.

Speaker 2:          17:28          Yeah, she's not, it's not healthy. A lot of women, it's not so much at their interest. I mean resources are good only to the extent that they allow you to ascend the social hierarchy, right. This, this doesn't explain why some women are attracted to the starving artists, right? Because what, why are so many women romanticizing over the guy with the guitar, but that's because they are choosing him based on his future trajectory. Right. I am. I am banking on the fact that you exhibit enough talent that I suspect that by investing in you, by choosing you, it's going to take me to that trajectory. No woman has ever authored the following words. You have no talent. You exhibit no ambition. You're never going to step out of the basement. Let's have sex. Right? So, so it's not that women are only interested in money. They're interested in a panoply of cues, all of which relate to the potential of ascending the social hierarchy.
