Speaker 1:          00:00          Her low freak. Bitches were kidding Eli's. We're kidding. Don't call Elis and either to get mad at that too. Eliza, you know she doesn't use the last name anymore. Well, neither does I will. Christina is Christina pain now? Really? Sebastian Maniscalco was just Sebastian now. White people getting crazy lately. Tig Notaro has just tig. Is that cultural appropriation? Two's a white person do use only one name. I always forget what's cultural appropriation. We need to constantly be reminded. I tweeted something today. I was reading a fucking article and I almost punched my screen. They're saying that hoop earrings are cultural now. Girls aren't allowed to wear hoop earrings. Who rail a cultural appropriation? Damn. Q. How fucking privileged you have to be like how softly the hoop earrings criticized as cultural appropriation. Do you know how soft you have to be to give in to that, to give them that and how?

Speaker 1:          00:58          How fucking dumb you have to be to say that. Yeah, you have to be so dumb and racist. I think it's the, it's the Israeli system is racist against white people. Racist against black, but what their jungle jungle people that only wear giant fucking hoops in their ears. What I read was Latinas, Latinas are criticizing it and saying it's a part of their culture. It's their culture. Yeah. It's like people are just picking tack. Black people don't want girls to wear braids. Oh, corn rows can't wear cornrows. Yeah. You could wear like regular white people braids, but little skinny brains. That's cultural appropriation. What about goldilocks? She was white. What about golf shirts? Are they a lot of golf for eight? They shouldn't be. If we started easy with these braids. It's green pants. Here's the problem. A little bells. All this we bullshit. The entire country is a melting pot of cultural appropriation.

Speaker 1:          01:54          You dumped cuts, right? That is the whole idea of having a civilization is that you get to share each other's food, share each other's recipes, listen to each other's music, listened to each other's jokes and stories get by each of these clothes. You know, there was this, um, journalists that went to Japan and they were talking about cultural appropriation. Whether or not they thought that like white girls like Katy Perry wearing the geisha outfit was cultural appropriation and they were, they were like universally saying no, we're happy that people love Japanese culture. They do that, they're happy. Yeah. But over here you get these fucking dummies that are just looking to complain and criticize and just call out everything and everybody about everything. Yeah. It's a, Oh my God, I see this. What does this, no, Jeremy Lin. Yeah. So yeah, came out with a, in the preseason, I think he had dreadlocks in his hair and a former NBA player called him out on it.

Speaker 1:          02:55          Kenyon Martin. But Jimmy Lens response to it was actually really good. If you want to check that out. Hey man, it's all good. You don't have to like my hair and definitely entitled to your opinion. Actually I ledge, I legit grateful you Sharon. It TBH to be honest, at the end of the day, I appreciate that I have dreads and you have Chinese tag out cause I think it's a sign of respect and I think as minorities, the more we appreciate each other's cultures, the more we influenced mainstream society. Thanks for everything you did for the nets and hoops. Had your poster up on my wall growing up. Oh Shit. What he said, right. That's really classy. I'm somebody really need to tell him like, all right bro, we get it. You want to be black like we get it. But the last name is Lynn. All right, well he's who said that?

Speaker 1:          03:40          The other guy who was the other guy? Kenyon Martin or there was a picture of his but it's been removed. Well he's a dummy and that Jeremy Lin guys are very classic character for the way you answered it. First of all, dreads or not black, they were assigned of people not washing their hair. That dates back to the Greeks and the Romans. There's ancient sculptures of Caucasian looking people with dreadlocks. Dreadlocks were warned by the Vikings is not a black thing because some black people wearing them does not mean it's the idea that this is a real thing. That's cultural appropriation that people go around pointing at people saying you can't wear your hair a certain way. Like we're limiting hairstyles and it's just so many people are just looking forward to criticizing, getting shitty with people over almost nothing. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          04:27          It's just no. The whole day, the whole energy of this country is supposed to be complete assimilation. Like you said, let's pick the best shit from each culture and may get just American hodgepodge and that's what it's about with gentrification. You know, you want people to not all live in one neighborhood and all dress exactly the same as each other. You want there to be a merging of different looks, different addresses. Sure. Working in different trades, you know, they used to be, if you were Irish, you were a cop. That's it. That's what we fucking did. You know, we were cops are, we were soldiers when we first came over here and like the 1860s during the famine, they just, we got off the boat hungry and they throw a fucking uniform on us and sent us into fight front lines against the south. Or You were a cop.

Speaker 1:          05:15          And then after that they got into the trades. There's a lot of Irish people in unions, right? You know, a lot of Irish in the Longshoreman's union, a lot of Irish in the, you know, the Carpenter's union. But look, fusion restaurants, what's a fusion restaurant? And you take a couple of different cultures, you combine their food and do some sort of a unique thing. And it's, it was a big thing for a while. People loved fusion. Yeah. They love that kind of food. And now there's a ton of people complaining when White People Cook Mexican food. Like there's this famous guy, I forget his name, can't be that famous, I guess he's not that famous, I forget his name, but he's a famous white guy who loves Mexican food. And He, um, opened up a Mexican restaurant and all these people got pissed that this guy is a cooking Mexican food.

Speaker 1:          06:05          But this guy has been writing books about Mexican cuisine. He goes down to Mexico, he learns how to Cook Authentic Mexican dishes from people that live in these villages and towns in Mexico and, and like has a deep love and appreciation for the culture of Mexico. Ms Guys, essentially a Mexican cuisine scholar and all these people give this fucking poor guy. That's his name. What is his name? Bailiff. Rick Bayless. And he's famous. I mean I've, I've read one of his books on Mexican food and I've seen articles written on them and video interviews and stuff. And this guy is getting in, in trouble with other people. When chefs become famous cooking other cultures, food, you don't own your culture. You fucking idiot. You know why? Because you didn't create it. You didn't invent pizza. You didn't invent pasta, you didn't invent Chinese food. It's been around for hundreds of fucking years. You were just born. You were born with a certain ethnicity. You don't own that ethnicity. The idea that you can keep other people from enjoying it and appreciating the history of other human beings is fucking racist. And it's stupid. This, this thing that we're getting into, we were criticizing people, you know, based on various aspects of culture that they enjoy. It's insanity. It's insanity.

Speaker 2:          07:29          I know. Think about how Italians have affected like fashion in this country. I mean, from high fashion all the way down to like the disco era when all of a sudden music,

Speaker 1:          07:41          right? We're all calling themselves Gadi and they were all calling al Capone. I mean, come on man. I mean, how many fucking rap songs like have godfather lyrics and just cut the shit? It's so stupid. It's so stupid. And that's my culture. I'll tell you, you can have it.

Speaker 2:          07:59          That's why I love one of the seminal moments in American culture was Aerosmith getting together with DMC and doing walk this way. That was, that's what America's supposed to be.

Speaker 1:          08:08          Yeah. It's just, it's kids today looking to point the finger, uh, the world they see and looking to find fault in it and find fault in each other. And it's this call out culture that we see. There's plenty of shit that's wrong in the world. There's plenty of shit. And I guess this is just a byproduct of people having the freedom to communicate. I mean, I guess that's what we're seeing, but there's, there's plenty of shit to really pay attention to. Jeremy Lin wearing dreadlocks isn't on that list. You know, girls that wear hoop earrings isn't on that list. It's just fucking white. Yeah. Right.

Speaker 2:          08:46          Kids that wear baggy pants. So what, so what, who gives a shit? Yeah. To me that's a sign that they're like accepting black culture. Yeah. They want to intern intermix. They want to hang out together and share each other's fashions and ideas and drugs and women.

Speaker 3:          09:12          Yeah.
