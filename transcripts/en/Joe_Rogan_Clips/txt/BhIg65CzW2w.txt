Speaker 1:          00:00          And, uh, I, I feel like there's a fundamental, fundamental problem with the way people approach ideas. And, uh, I think it goes back to what we're talking about earlier about right versus left or Republican versus Democrat. They're not thinking of the consequences of arguing for a, against the possibility that climate change is a human costing. They're not thinking of the consequences. They just want to win. Right. Right. And want their side to be ready to be right. And the, you know, what bums me out is they don't understand the consequences of that for the both the American enterprise and the human enterprise. Right? I mean, because, you know, uh, if you, if you keep calling one branch of science a hoax, then what's to say the other branches like, well, you know, then you just, you're, you're rolling down this slippery slope where like the other countries, you know, like, so most of the, of the Nobel Prizes Americans have one where people from other countries, they came here to do their science because we had the best scientific enterprise.

Speaker 1:          00:54          The next generation, we'll just go somewhere else. I'll go to China. You know, so, um, there's that part of it. And the other point it's like, dude, it's just science. It doesn't care about your political views and you know, it's not fair to use the cell phone and take the antibiotics and then turn around and like, and then suddenly treat this thing as if it was another thing in your bucket of, you know, ideologies. I think also people think if you somehow or another compromise industry's ability to, to work, that you're going to kill jobs and you're going to damage the economy and that's more important. Yeah. But I think it's the exact opposite. Right? And if people really saw it, right, I mean, um, you know, again, just like I'm saying, climate change shows how powerful people become. It also shows how powerful are our enterprise.

Speaker 1:          01:36          Right? We did this by, you know, building businesses by building enterprise by, and we built this world girdling machine of civilization and it, you know, the planet actually noticed. Why do you like that term world? Girdling because that's, it gives me the EXEC girdle wrapping around. It's because it's from like a Shakespeare, like from a Caesar or something. I always thought it was good, but it's the idea that like, you know, in, um, the foundation trilogy, the Isaac Azman Off, you know, classic science fiction thing, then there's the city of the planet of Transport, which is the center of the, uh, the empire, the collected empire. And it's, you know, it's basically the whole planet. It's been covered in city, you know, like the other, that planet, you got to go down like 500 levels before you get to the surface. So that idea, you know, I mean, what I like about it is the idea that like, you know, we've done something, we're kind of covered the planet in our, our effect, you know, covered the planet in our enterprise.

Speaker 1:          02:27          So this issue of business is that like, um, there's a place I can stand in Rochester. I did this for NPR and there's the Erie Canal. I can stand right on the edge of the Erie Canal. Then there's a train tracks. The tracks was laid, those tracks were laid back and you know, the original line back in the 18th whatever seventies then there's a highway and then there's the airport right over there, four different infrastructures, you know, which he, everyone took huge amounts of money to build, one of which we don't even use anymore. Right. So the idea of building an a, an a, an infrastructure that will, that will not be carbon polluting will not trigger climate change. Like did it, this is what we do. You know. So the idea that there's gotta be more jobs that come out of this, then it could ever come out of fossil fuels.

Speaker 1:          03:06          You know, it's not a big deal for human beings because that's what we do to switch infrastructures and there will be a lot of wealth generated up by, you know, just like there was when we switched to the trains, you know, where's the argument coming that we owe? Because there are people that just adopt the, the party line, the party line that climate's always changed and human beings barely affected. And it's not something to concentrate on. Where's that coming from? Again, I think it's the, you know, the gradual political polo polarization of everything, you know, cause you look at, in the, um, we're now at the, uh, what is it, 30 year anniversary of Jim Hanson, who was, you know, the famous climate scientist giving his testimony in front of Congress in 1988 on a hot, sweltering summer day. We said, climate change is already happening, you know, and that made news everywhere.

Speaker 1:          03:50          And that was the first like public awakening that this was happening. And if you look at the first Bush administration, they were like, oh yeah, we're ready to do something about this year. We can do it, you know? Um, and then it just gradually over time, as the whole political polarization thing happened, you can actually see the, uh, the, the very purposeful denial, right? They took a page out of the cigarette companies yeah. For years, right. The cigarettes were like, oh, if I, cigarette companies are like, no, it's not a problem. So they were purposefully, you know, there were people had money invested, right. You know, like didn't of, this is a documentary that that goes into that, um, w what is the name of that merchants of doubt. Merchants of doubt. That's a great book, man. That's a really good book. Yeah, the documentary is really good too.

Speaker 1:          04:29          So it was purposeful, but it's also confusing. It's like why are they doing that? Like who's paying them to do that? Obviously the cigarette companies would be paying the same people to put doubt into the idea that cigarettes are addictive or cigarettes cause cancer. And this is what had been done in the past. Now the same people are involved in doing it with climate change. Right. But why? Uh, well, you know, at one time I wrote a piece for the NPR that was kind of positive about like, hey, we can switch infrastructure is like I'm saying. And some guy wrote me back very angry and he said, you know, the proven reserves, you know, the stuff, the oil that's in the ground has a wealth, has a valve monetary value. Like they, you know, that's in there in the oil companies, banks, you know, the, in their bank accounts of one point $5 trillion.

Speaker 1:          05:12          And like I said, dude, you know, people have gone to war for a lot less than one point $5 trillion. So you know, if we were to really be like, hey man, we can't burn that, you know, you're gonna have to leave that in the ground. That's like through their bank accounts going like zero pretty fast. So what I don't, so it's those industries. I think that's part of it. And then it gets, you get linked to other things and then it becomes this sort of like mass, uh, you know, becomes the political poll. They use the political polarization to sort of, you know, sort of make this happen. It doesn't happen. You look at other countries aren't doing this right. That's the one thing, you know, other countries, there's always a little bit of climate denial going on, but we're like the only country that's guys you can see. Cause we're the only ones who are not part of the Paris accord. Well, it's one of the weirdest things about this right left things. The left is always supporting the environment. The, the left is all about the environment. The left

Speaker 2:          05:58          is about clean air and clean water. And how did that happen? I don't understand. I don't understand that either. The whole thing is very strange.

Speaker 1:          06:04          Well, I got, you know, I mean, I have issues with, you know, environmental lists too because, um, I think one of your shows I was watching, you know, the whole idea of Eco Bros, right? And you can eco brode by people. And I, so I have a piece in the New York Times today, an op Ed, where I'm basically saying like, look man, the planet is going to be fine. Like, you know, long term, there's nothing we can throw at the biosphere that it's going to kill it. We're in. It's not about saving the planet, the Earth. He's not a fuzzy little bunny. You know, the planet is powerful and it's really about saving us. Let's be honest about what's going on. And there's gonna be all kinds of ethical choices that go on that, you know, the polar bears may not be able to come along with us on the ride here. You know, we need a healthy biosphere with, you know, a lot of biodiversity, but you know, we're part of it and we're going to have an impact. There's no such thing as no impact. And you know, already I'm getting ECO brode people are like, you just, you know, you don't care about life. Yeah. What about I just like, oh, come on man. I just put it in the thing I said we need to be wise and compassionate, you know? But they're like no

Speaker 2:          06:55          convenient opinions. I mean this is, this is one of the things you get involved with when you start talking with people about really important issues. I mean, it's like we were talking about earlier, they want to be right. Yeah. And they want to be on the side. It's righteous and with virtue and ethics. Right, right. And they find anything that you disagree, they disagree with it. You're saying they don't ask you questions, they don't go. What do you think the implications are? Like how do you, how do we minimize the effects and the negative consequences of are they just immediately want to say, you are insensitive. You are an asshole. You are the problem. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:32          You didn't know my way around that. And that's what the whole book is about is to like, when you've got a polarization, right? You know, where you know you're either this or you're that. The thing that this is like a mathematical idea is to go orthogonal. You know, when you, when you, you know, you go, cause you know, it's a line basically, right? Either on this side or that side go 90 degrees to it and now you're in a whole new space. Now you're up and down to the left and right.
