Speaker 1:          00:00          G about that fucking dude in Colorado today. He killed a mountain lion with his bare hands. He smothered it to death. It get jacked him while he was jogging, he was running on the trails and mountain line grabbed him from behind. He got to struggle with is 80 pound cat and wound up suffocating it, I guess. Wow. Fucking bad ass jog or just, yeah. I want to know on a toddler, just call them them all a Fokker bars. Net fuck you. Fuck. It would have to be like Derrick Lewis or someone you know, like, so I can't picture anyone else being able to do that. Maybe he's a Jujitsu guy. Yeah, we see him. I've seen him when my kids were really young in Calabasas where I live, I saw one like just pacing back and forth and my back fence. Oh, lime Jesus. Yeah. They're out here, man.

Speaker 1:          00:44          They're out here and we see coyotes and deer all the time. But mountain lions, that's, that's next level. Scary. Yeah. A friend of mine just sent me a message this morning when, uh, I was, uh, when I posted that thing on Instagram about that guy that killed it and he said he was running on this fire road and he realized he like felt weird and looked over and 20 feet away from him was a big cat right above him on this ridge 20 feet. So that's basically us to that wall. Big Cat just looking at, and he said he waved his arms to look bigger and to think just walked away. Wow. Ah, I carry a knife when I run, I carry a fucking, uh, half face blades. It's got to like a loop. You could stick your thumb into it so it stays in your hand.

Speaker 1:          01:31          And people are like, why are you running with a knife? What the fuck are you doing? Like you don't need it until you do. And when you do you want to have it? Didn't someone get attacked by a coyote and hidden hills like running today? How do I hear a story about that? But I mean I've ran in my neighborhood before and up to coyotes ran right. Pass me the creeps. Yeah, they usually don't mess with like humans, you know. Well we had a problem with them killing chickens cause I have chickens in my yard. Yeah, I've lost a bunch of chickens to coyotes were they were, they were on top of the chicken coop, poem tiles off of it and they're creepy little fuckers math, but they're little, you know, these are like 35 45 pounds. They're not very big, but they're creepy. There's something about their little wolves and they're looking at you and they're trying to figure out a way like what can they eat?

Speaker 1:          02:17          What can't they eat? They're out there scraping, scraping and grinding. They're sneaky. That gangster. Like I saw one of my friends, a dear friend of mine, he lost both of his dogs to coyotes and he had, I think he had like surveillance of it and one is in the yard and he's playing dead and then his a dog's approach, what they think is dead. And then basically like his home, he comes out of nowhere and attacks on the end. They both, and the one that's playing dead attacks and both of his dogs were a rap. How big was dogs? Small. I mean, they were smaller dogs, but now he has like big German shepherds and he's, you know, he's kind of like a bigger dogs now, but it was really sad, man. It is a very, very, very crazy, yeah, they, they figure out some way to work and cooperate together without communicating.

Speaker 1:          03:05          It's very interesting. Like if it wasn't so sad that they're killing someone's pat, it's, it's really kind of fascinating that they're so smart that they would play dead. There was a guy that used to work at this pet store that I go to and uh, he, uh, also worked in a veterinary, I'm center, a medical place and a pit bull came in big at one of those big Jack pit bulls just covered and cuts. It cuts all over its body. And, uh, the owner was, you know, they asked the owner like, what the fuck happened? He goes, I don't know. He goes, I, I came home and he's covered in cots. I really have no idea what happened to him. So stitch the dog out, but hundreds of stitches all over the dog's body. Then he takes a walk outside of his house and he follows his dog's blood and he goes up into the hills near his house and he finds nine dead coyotes.

Speaker 1:          03:52          Wow. That pit bull was starr apparently tear. And he said it looked like Vietnam. It looked like a fucking like saving private Ryan just ripped apart coyotes. Nine of them. This motherfucker just went mall and they must have been so bombed out there. Like when look at this dog. Yeah, there's nine of us. We're good. We got this guy and then you see this fucking fire hydrant head just, well that doesn't feel pain. They, they've engineered those things. Like there's some pit bulls. This is pit bull. Uh, if you go on Instagram, I think it's, I am the hulk. That's, that's the name of the, it's a 200 pound pit bull. Like they've gotten them to 200 pounds. Now. It's the most preposterous thing you've ever seen in your life. It looks like, like, like Brock Lesnar, if it was a pit bull, it's like, it doesn't even make any sense. You look at it like that. A pitbull used to be like a 35 pound dog. These to be small. They look at that thing. Why in the fuck? Imagine if a coyote saw that. Fuck

Speaker 2:          04:55          those bull mastiffs. There's fucking scary too.

Speaker 1:          05:02          Yeah. I had a master if he passed away recently, I was 13 years old. We had to put them down then. It was really sad. He was, he was a great dog. Mastiffs are so sweet. Look, look at the size of that fucking dog man.

Speaker 2:          05:18          Just yoke to just crazy 200 pound pit bull. It's just so crazy.

Speaker 1:          05:25          They make them that big now. Like a hundred pound pit bull used to be a bit. I had a 90 pound one. It was a big dog and I was like, wow, that's a big pit bull. I'm like, yeah, it's a big pit bull. This dog's 110 pounds bigger. Maybe it doesn't even make any sense.

Speaker 2:          05:38          Wow.

Speaker 1:          05:42          It's a fucking tank. Yeah. But that, that's one of my favorite coyote death, death stories. This guy going up into the hills and find all these dead coyote is just laying in a pile. They tried to ambush them. What they would do, they tried to get one to come out and try to get chased, and then the one would run, and then the other ones, ones with jump it. There's like a gang. It's straight up. That's crazy that they think like that though. That they've actually, they have actually have strategies. They're savages. Yeah.
