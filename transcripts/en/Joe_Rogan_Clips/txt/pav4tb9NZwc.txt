Brendan, if he was the king or the president of MMA, how would he, what would he do about the steroids situation? And he said he would get rid of Usada. Correct.

Or a coach would, we'd be like, hey man, you know, can do this. This, I couldn't afford it though. How much are we talking? Uh, I don't know. Cause they were going through like a doctor and I just remember, Dr, I don't think he's still in business. And, uh, I remember that your insurance won't coach. You got paid cash or MIRA ass.
