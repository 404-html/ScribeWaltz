Speaker 1:          00:00          Did you see the video of the poachers that went to kill the rhino and the lion? The lion killer video of it. I saw a picture. I still still picture. Oh, okay. Yeah. I didn't know if they got a video, but yeah, that's fucked up. That's fucking a few duets got jacked, right. Sweet. Even that's the lions and we even look at this. Turn up the volume.

Speaker 2:          00:17          Jamie.

Speaker 1:          00:19          Look, I don't want to [inaudible] Shit.

Speaker 2:          00:22          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22          I don't want to use my bear spray. He said that's a good boy. That's a good boy too. He's coming around.

Speaker 2:          00:33          That's good. Okay. Come forward.

Speaker 1:          00:37          Yes. My things mother motherfuckers, it's following them. It's circling them around. Yeah. He's cute. I mean that thing is circling him, man. It's going towards him. That's a good boy. Yeah. The thing is, the thing is coming way too close to him, man. It's like going in a circle.

Speaker 2:          00:55          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56          Crappies huge. Hell No. Yeah, they got lucky there. I would have been gone. The scary thing about that is that bear could have just decided randomly through some firing of his bare synapses to take a left instead of right. Yes, go at him. He just, he could have easily decided that all those things crazy scare the shit out of me. You know why man? We don't believe in things we don't see. We don't believe in them. What do you mean you don't believe in things you don't see? You know it's real, but you don't believe danger. No, you don't believe in it. It's not. It's not a real thing in your world. Right? Right. When you, if you were outside and you saw that, if you will, with those people in Australia, you, you Biller, oh Jesus Christ. This is what I know. If I was there, I would know that that's the reality.

Speaker 1:          01:38          That's really like my world. Does it evolve? Does it involve being somewhere near that close to a bear? So to see it in my world would be what? The F W I wouldn't be real. No. Like holy shit, this can't be happening. But if you were with those people, if you went on that trip with the odd beat, that would be fucking fell out. One of the craziest things you get out with you, your whole existence gets down to the chance that this thing makes a decision to go one way or another. Yeah. Otherwise it's just going to run you down. Just like less like life. If you go in a certain scenario scenarios you like, wait, this shit can get real real fast. Real fast know. Yeah. That's one of them man. That his life, any inner city life is just like holy shit. It's about of a pop off in here.

Speaker 1:          02:19          Yeah. Right. How many people died in Chicago last week? Some insane number. There was a, the reporting on uh, the lack of attention that the murders in Chicago are getting and like the national news and how crazy it is. Right. How good. The Chicago several times. The one thing that sticks out to me every time I go, there's how segregated it this. Yeah. I've never gone made you aware of a major city like New York is like, we're all right. Piled up together for killed 24 wounded and weekend shootings. God, 28 people got shot. Dude, that is crazy. 28 over the weekend in the afternoon and say fuck standing on a sidewalk wouldn't fire

Speaker 1:          03:08          Jesus Christ. There is a, there is a war going on in Chicago that's way more deadly than most of the wars were engaging in overseas. You don't hear about that many soldiers dying every day. Now that's another, that's another scenario how we said like that's real. Yeah, that's real. Right? But here's real asked. You are there outside in Chicago. That is a real fear that you should have and this is what's crazy number of people in Chicago. That's your passes. 1400 1400 people shot. Now how many people do we know how many got shot? Like doing tours of Afghanistan? That's a good question. What does this, this is the over the year this does this year. Sure. Yeah. Okay, so let's Google. How many soldiers were shot overseas this year?

Speaker 1:          03:58          You know the, that's a weird thing man. We got a war going on. If that was Mexicans invading North Dakota and shooting people now, many people were dying every day we would be taking action. Who, because it's happening to people is 1400 and a hundred of them were white people. It would be an issue. Oh yeah. It was 1300 black people in 100 white people. It'd be, yeah, we shut it down. You really, right. This is, I mean, it's something that people don't talk about this 300. I mean, he's like, uh, be crazy. That's a weird statistic. It's a terrible situation. Like culturally to have something like this is hilarious. And with 1400 people being shot, that means, and people don't want to realize this is, you know, post traumatic stress disorder is a real thing in the ghetto as well as in the hills of Afghanistan.

Speaker 1:          04:50          It's real, of course. So when you see something that, when people were like, why these guys have guns on them? It's like, dude, 1400 people got shot. I'm just trying to get to school and back. Yeah. I'm trying to get to work and back. Of course it's, you know, we're not protecting those people. It's exactly, if they were stuck somewhere overseas in some, in the middle of some war, you know, and they were American citizens and be like, please help get us out of, you've got to get these good. If there was a place that had like statistically the numbers of the south side of Chicago where all this, the murder's going down, there was a place statistically in another part of the world, right. We would be set those numbers anywhere else. And it's a, it's a crisis. If we had, so let's say Hawaii, let's say if we had just moved into Hawaii, right?

Speaker 1:          05:32          Like just just took over Hawaii and then we're in an area where people started getting shot at and killed by local site that we would want to read, want to extract those people from Hawaii. We'd scoop them up from an island. We would think they'd be shooting at the helicopter says we restaurant. Right, right. Well you just look at the real numbers. Just the raw numbers. That's a crazy number of people getting shot this year. This is July, so I just started how many soldiers got shot? I can't find trying to find wounded. I can only find a deaths. Okay. What's it deaths? It's only like 1500 total since like 2001 since 2001 man or 26 January.

Speaker 3:          06:09          It seems weird saying only I know what you're saying. You just saying in comparison to the other number since January. Yeah. That's insane. That's crazy. That is insane. And that's happening right here in the good old us of a, in one of the biggest cities in the world. Chicago's giant, awesome city. And it's happening in other cities also that people don't know about, but Chicago is the most glaring. Yeah, because I don't travel around there, so I don't know a what happened or why it happened, why they have this segregation there and what it was. All right.

Speaker 1:          06:38          Go to Chicago, man. It's like black people all the way over there. Then it's downtown where it's nice and everybody's, you know, Detroit has that too, right? It's right as well. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Um, man. Then you go down south. It's like that. You go to Louisiana. It was crazy. You were the king or the president. Tony Rock. I was the president. How do you fix this? Uh, you have to fix this. It's a process, man. First, I always say number one is education, right? Education is number one. If you're just, if you're getting a better education than you just avoid the pitfalls and naturally because you just know that these certain things are wrong. And, and by getting a badge at better education, I mean you have opportunities to do, you know, you have a music appreciation, you have the arts, you have sports, you have things to occupy you during school hours and after school hours.

Speaker 1:          07:34          There's no type of any type of extra curricular, extra curricular activities for these kids. In Chicago. There's gang life, which you are born into, which you are expected to go into once you are a certain age. You all right your man. Now here's the gun. We don't like those guys. Those guys don't like us. You don't even question it. It's like my father has been this way. My grandfather has been this way. My uncles a display, my big brothers to this way, you don't even, you're born right into it. You don't want it in a war zone, all right? And you don't question it.

Speaker 3:          08:00          And it's a war zone where you sleep and your family lives, right. Not just a war zone with soldiers, but a war zone with families.

Speaker 1:          08:06          And another thing better education you, you're more worldly. If you see the world, you realize how small that, how small your neighborhood is. And there's a bigger world out there and you could want to go places and see things and then you realize like what are we doing here? But these are people that I guarantee probably never left Chicago, probably never went on vacation to the south to visit grandparents and realize, damn, the south is nice and quiet and the people are friendly and they've never been to the zoo and saw animal and went home and googled the mating rituals of this. Open your mind, open your mind, you see the world, the stuff that you're involved in becomes just so small. This guy, I don't let Scott cause he has one red and I have on blue, I don't get it. So the education, that tiny little

Speaker 3:          08:56          area, you know, that he operates in with his living his life, it does matter.

Speaker 1:          09:02          It's a reality. Right? The reality is what's around you. Yeah. That's what, until you get a scope of a bigger world. Like I grew up in the hood, I grew up in bed Stuy, Brooklyn, but one of the wildest neighborhoods when I was going up there, but my vision was passed it. My vision was, yeah, this is going on outside, but I'm going to be there one day. What do you attribute the, having the ability to do that to uh, having a mom and a dad? I pops, my father worked two full time jobs my whole childhood. My father literally worked 80 hours a week, 80 so just to see him go everyday and like, damn this dude, this dude works hard man. Wow. Didn't have a lot to show for it and made sure his kids had, mom was a teacher. Education was, she'd been an emphasis on it. Wow. You know, it was, it was just like my friends, my, my, one of my best friends down the block. No Dad, my friend across the street, no dad, my friend, two doors down, no dad. Then crack came and that was everything fucked up. Everything started. Just the neighborhood started just to, you know. Yeah. That was like a revelation. Crack was people that

Speaker 3:          10:08          are alive today or young kids today, they don't remember the eighties yeah, there was a like a plague. Yup. A plane hit. Everybody knew somebody that got hit and so many people's lives were gone, done, done over. People who were doing fine and then all of a sudden,

Speaker 1:          10:26          yeah, Yup, I remember it. I remember it well. Yeah. It was a weird kind of way to start losing friends. That's what I, that's what happened. I started losing friends. I, I saw it like people don't, it was crazy man. Like Shit. When the shit we saw, I saw a friend get shot in the head, like talk to him on the corner. Engaged. What's up man? Yeah, we gonna play ball lady. You wouldn't play ball. All right, cool. I'll hit you later. Turned to walk down the block. Look that maybe, you know, a thousand feet away and looked back to like just, you know, looking around the neighborhood and saw a guy just bang, got kinda like he was, he looked like, if you ever see an old like big daddy Kane album, he had the flat top and a bunch of jewelry on, on the corner, on the pay phone.

Speaker 1:          11:11          This is beeper days, you know, and you got to turn. And the guy ran up on him while he was returning a beep and just tried to rob him. And then he went for his gun and the guy just boom right in his head, right on the corner of my block, brightest, right on the corner of my block. And I went home and my parents are there and I was like, this is crazy man. And that's where I grew up. But my vision was not confined to where I was. It was, I'm going to be, you know, fortunately I get out of here, I'm going to do this and once I leave here, I'm going to,

Speaker 3:          11:40          you're very fortunate to have those kinds of examples. You know, if your dad who worked out that and your mom, very fortunate. That's awesome. Yeah, man, it's hard for some people if they didn't get the break that you got in that regard.

Speaker 1:          11:53          That's why I don't, I, it's not missed on me. Like I realized like if I didn't get that, I didn't catch that last Chapa. Hmm. Good for you, man. That's uh, but that's, that's where character comes from to mean having someone like that as an example. Like how someone who can work two full time jobs. Yeah. And that is, that's a force of will most people struggle with one man. One is hard, eight hours a day and he makes it time. My Dad's rule was everybody had to have a job at 1413 was your last summer. Enjoy yourself at the ball, do whatever you wanna do. 14 you getting a job. Wow. Yep. No, he didn't play at all. 14 job since those, he's, the thing is, man, that's a bitter pill to swallow when you're young, but damn, that dude's who go through that always seem like they have an extra gear.

Speaker 1:          12:46          You know? I know a lot of dudes who went through like bootcamp type dads and they did not like it, but they can do some shit. Like I'll just a little bit more shit that other people could do. You know? They might not look like the fact that dad was always telling them what to do, but these motherfuckers can hike 20 miles. Yeah. And not complaining. My Dad wasn't bootcamp, but it was like, you're going to work. That's not even a question. You're going to work. And then I have so many siblings that what his rule was, you know, we all had to take care of each other. So my oldest brother, of course, he turns 14 first he's working, he gets paid. You have to give everybody $5 you get, you got paid today. Give all your siblings five dot. Wow. Next brother gets a job.

Speaker 1:          13:21          Now it's two brothers working. Give everybody $5 wow. It was like a socialism. Yeah. My Dad just made sure it all worked. That's cool. That's very generous too. That's like everybody that's forcing everybody to be in it together. Right. That's smart. And taking Mandarin. And then it was, the rule was it was, uh, if your brother's in a fight, you're in a fight. So then it became don't fuck with the rock brothers. Cause there's so many of them, you have to fight all of them. So that kind of kept us safe during this whole, you know, wow, that's awesome. And what a, it's a bad situation to be in, but, uh, a great place to develop character, right. Opportunities. The right character there. Yeah. You know who you are, you know what you're, you know that you, you know, you develop a, a sense of, uh, you know, go and get it work hard.

Speaker 1:          14:09          No excuses, nobody's doing it for you. Nobody's coming to save you. You're responsible for you. Yeah, man, we all need to have a little bit more of that in our life. And then also a little bit more community to, you know, and I that right. And we grew up in a time where it was next door neighbor could spank you, lady across the street could grab you and make you sit down on the stupid ticket. Mother came home, right? The guy in the Bodega at the corner would tell you to sit inside and your mother came home. Yeah, people would, uh, they would police the neighborhood policing we live in now. We live in, don't talk to my kid, don't touch my kid. Have Right. Get off my son. Don't touch my child. You know, there's a lot of that. Well, it's because somebody's man, that's the weird balance. I talked about this recently, but my cousin, I saw my cousin

Speaker 3:          14:52          gets smacked by some lady once when we were, we were both like, my cousin's a year younger than me, so I'm might have been six and she might've been five somewhere around there. It wasn't any older than that. Right. And this lady cuffed her and right in the face, man, she fell. This lady fell on the ice and my cousin just happened to be there and she was looking at her on the ground and she did not laugh at her, but the lady said she laughed at and she, the lady got up and she was just angry that she fell and hurt herself. She got up and smack my cousin right in the face. My cousin fell down and I remember seeing it and realizing I couldn't do anything about it to save her, to help her. You know, I was a little kid too, and being terrified that this grown up person just smack this little kid in the head for something that wasn't even real. Right. Like you don't want that either. Right. It's like, don't touch my kid. It's probably better. Well, that's in the long run. Crazy. People smile. Helping raise a child. That's right. I mean, as adults, that's just a crazy, she was a crazy lady that lives in our building.
