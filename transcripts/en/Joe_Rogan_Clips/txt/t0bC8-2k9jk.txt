Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. I Dunno, but I feel like, remember when you told me that story about the monkey that you had, that you had when you were on fear factor. Beat my ass that when you held that little thing you thought this thing's made a word that that's what I feel when I get you up on my shoulder. I'm like, damn, this thing's made a would absolutely start beep do. I was telling Jamie, I've, I think I've told you this story, I've probably told it to everybody. I've met that I have a little baby chimp on the a set of Newsradio like way back in the day. It was supposed to be in some stuff that I tell you this, I probably said it before. This little motherfucker was on my back and he hit me a couple times and I was stunned. I was like, oh no, this is not what I thought it was.

Speaker 1:          00:45          I thought it was like a little person like, oh, this little person thinks he's a bad ass. Let me just calm him down. Now he got on top of HR. Just hit me a couple times. On the back and I was like, what in the fuck? I just was thinking it immediately. I started doing the math in my head and thinking what it would be like to be confronted by a full grown chimp. Okay, well that's my argument with the silver back versus grizzly. You said Grizzly because grizzlies or even more and more of the fucking bad ass than a chimp. Grizzly. Grizzly can't like, there's no way a chimp can outrun a grizzly. There's no way. Not a chance in hell. What's this? I don't know if that's true. What is a silver back? Full speed. I seen one of those things. Grizzly can outrun a soda.

Speaker 1:          01:29          You know it. I'm strong. I feel confident. I think chimps are faster than gorillas and I think at grizzly can outrun a chimp. Jan, I say for me, I think there's no way the guerrillas getting fucked. He's getting Denise, Dude, I'm telling you right now, big ass and tiering your hands feel like when they shake mine. So I would be, I guess I'm not like a grizzly, but a giant dude would crumple you like half empty pop. It would even, it would even be like, he wouldn't even feel you. He would go through you like whipped cream fee. 25 miles an hour. Top speed. What does it say? Feels like 25 25 similar animals speeds 34 but it feels like 25 I don't understand. What that means is from someone riding it's back. Get to a different website that says, is that really what this is?

Speaker 1:          02:22          Oh my God, I love the name. What PD? Where'd that come from? Do you know where that came from? For elk speed of animals.com a wall PD? Yeah. What does it, where does that word come? That's what an elk is. Dude, I but I why? It's actually a whopping who called it the WAPA. What does that, where does that name come from? I've heard it. It's a cool name. Wapa he Wednesdays the Hashtag cam uses it a lot. Powerful WAPA to Wednesday. Thanks champ. I said it's silver band. I don't want to know what my gap is. What you think of champions faster? Jump off there. Don't you think in chip is faster than a gorilla silver bag. Okay. Have you seen a silver back come out of the fricking, the jungle house told you so? This is what I'm thinking. Restraints. It's a, it's just like an archery argument.

Speaker 1:          03:11          Yeah, maybe. I think the bear gets a heavier arrow, slower speed, fast Arrow, but there's not much of a difference in the speed. It's real close and a grizzly bear is so much bigger movement, so much more mass around like have a big grizzly is 500 pounds a silver back. I'm pretty sure. I mean a big grizzly interior. Grizzly. What does a big one, like 900 is that really not? I'm not a mountain grizzly. What did you look it up? I was there. The more aggressive ones, six or 700 and the really big ones at the coastal ones. Right, which they call brown bears first rounders. Yeah. Why do they call them that? But because it's the same animal. Different Specie, is it? Yes. Yeah. Interbreed or anything bigger? The break. There's just totally different bear. Yeah. One looks like a Volkswagen with hair and one looks more like a Ford truck.

Speaker 1:          03:58          It's one of those other things where the the one that has the scary, your name is like not the biggest one, which is weird. Like Brown bear sounded like. Oh he's so cuddly and yeah, those buses under brainiac island. Yeah. Coke Klondike bars. That's right. What would you do for a Klondike Bar? I fucking, I'm your buddy. I live in a place where there's no vegetables. It's a conspiracy theory. Told her bears brought that up. They literally made those to make themselves look cuddly. So humans would be stupid enough to walk up to him. Do you think it's like a nature trick? Like nature made them cool to look at so we don't mind as much that they're murderers. I would argue Disney fucking Disney, right? Like that Bambi movie. So slower by 10 miles an hour to the, is there anyone that has that I told you?

Speaker 1:          04:49          No. But is there any strength of a silver back versus a grizzly? I say this saying I really respect grizzly bears and brown bears cause you know that. Well, Debbie's the concerns of a lot of grizzly bears and brown bears that were listening to them and they were there. They're pumped. I think that, um, they're all dangerous and ferocious and I'm thinking silver back versus the nigger is you think you would win? Yeah. Maybe people who listen to this podcast and he said put it in the Po in the posts. What we need to know what people want to know. I wouldn't want to fight a 38 pound rat. No. I be fucking terrified to fight at 38 pound rat. So the idea of 38 I just can't put a number cause that's a fucking giant rat man. Yeah, but he should have said 30 40.

Speaker 1:          05:36          I know, but like 38 get it. What's a house cat weigh like 10 pounds? No Way. Garfield waste 10. Okay. Like seven, seven pounds. I'm like that. I would think something along those lines. Okay, now, now make it bigger. Like keep it like a what? What size is it? Become totally unmanageable. First off, let's, if you're not wearing welding gloves at 10 pound in shape house cat, you're not fucking like Garfield. You're talking like, I dunno. Let's talk about a Conor Mcgregor Garfield at coming in at 10, like a real good tiger cat. Like one of them, you know, those, those ones like real common house cat ones to look like a little picture of this pic. If you grabbed a 10 pound mountain lion, do you think you can control that? There's no way. My neighbor, my neighbor, a 38 pound, my neighbors, good buddy of mine and he, uh, he saw mountain lion and uh, he saw a mountain lion when they was walking his dogs get these little cutie dogs.

Speaker 1:          06:39          He's walking this little cutie dogs and he saw this fucking thing, so its tail and picked it up, picked the dogs up and ran back to his house. And, uh, then mark got on a website, got on a website and found out that, uh, that, that they attract this animal and that it, uh, it had a collar on it and uh, the tracked it and it got hit by a car on the five and he's explaining like how the whole, the whole thing went down. And I was like, Whoa, like that you were walking your dogs and this big ass cat. I was like 120 pound plus cat. So the actual cat that had a collar, he knew that's the one he encountered. Yeah. Yeah, he saw it. He saw the collar and then he went on the website and you can track because he, he'd found out that this cat had died and when he found out the cat died, he went and uh, oh, the sound of whiskey.

Speaker 1:          07:25          Are you good? Yeah, I'm good dude. Trust me, your Yeti talking a lot of stupid shit. I never even touch that. I definitely have. How dare you. Are you one of those guys bro? You ain't even been drunk cause me bro. Quit bullying me. Sorry. That's my instinct. What we were just, what, what the fuck was I just getting to eat? I had on rat. Oh yeah. Among other things. So a silver back is essentially like a super, a super prime it right. The most super, super prime. Yes. But a bear is one of the most super, Super Freak Predator animal freak out. Things like if a bear was little, like a nine pound bear, like the size of a nine pound rat was trying to kill you, you'd be freaking the fuck out. If it was running at like a little tiny bear, you'd be fucking terrified.

Speaker 1:          08:12          Now think of a giant one and realize how you, you are totally defenseless and I don't think it's going to be that much difference for Adam will literally think of a silver back gorilla with the way they're built and they swing around. I think if he stood on the chest of a grizzly can grab its paws and literally rip its arms out and beat it with it. Wow. That's King Kong was a good movie. I agree with you there. I enjoyed it as much as the next day thinking it Kong. But I believe that I'm talking think that's correct. I don't think they're that strong. The thumb, the thumb doves does give an advantage though, right? It could grab, wait, it's a little smarter. Yes. Yeah. Jamie. Great. But he just the barest way stronger, way stronger. Way Stronger. It could smack at once. I've seen that. I've seen a grown mountain grizzly hit a moose and can, yeah.

Speaker 1:          09:05          You told me that, that I've seen you saw it with your own eyes. Right, right. Is there any solid information of strength of a silver back for it and there's not, there's just a lot of people have argued this on the Internet for the last five to 10 we get dangerously close to this argument. Seriously. Why don't they put Thor's hammer on the ground have and like put a, put a Taco in it or something to where a grizzly has to try to grab it and pull it off and have a sensor versus the silver back down. Well, the grizzly would definitely can't grab as hard because it doesn't have thumbs like we talked about, but I think, yeah, but that's relative to a beating, right? Who, how many fighters have a big ass and a lot of like leg power, cro, cough versus someone that's just sheer grill up top. Let's do go there. I just wonder how strong a gorilla really is in comparison to which essentially like a giant dog. I just think he's going to get far you crazy. You think a silver back is equivalent to a giant dog? A bearers? What I'm saying is a bear. A bear is like essentially like a giant house. Wow. Why would I call it silver backhoe? Put Dog.

Speaker 2:          10:23          Yeah.
