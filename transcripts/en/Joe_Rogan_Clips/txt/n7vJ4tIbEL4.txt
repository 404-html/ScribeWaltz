Speaker 1:          00:00          We're absolutely not meant to live, piled on top of each other within, you know, 10 million of us in a square mile and the island of Manhattan, you know? Yes, absolutely. Do you remember when there was the floods in Manhattan? Yes. All the money in the world couldn't get you out. Right. You have to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge to leave Manhattan with everybody else, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:28          Yeah. And there was a word real worry because of climate change that was going to be happening every year. Now people are like, is this the new normal? I remember Shane Smith at some piece on the walkout. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Shane had to walk out and, but he had some piece on vice where they're detailing the inside of his, uh, apartment building. Like the fucking thing was completely flooded, like six feet high and water, you know, and people were, weren't worried like this is going to be what's happening on a regular basis now. Like this climate change thing has changed.

Speaker 1:          00:55          I've a heightened sense of, oh, you know, since have three kids. I, it's something that I think about. It's something that I have ready. You know, I bought a generator. I have, yeah, I checked the batteries, the rechargeable batteries for all of the equipment that I have. I own solar panels, I own other Duffel bag full of everything that I need to throw in the back of my pickup truck, grabbed my kids and I know which way to drive away from the city to go to the cabin. It's something I've plaid just because I'm the ward of these small humans whom I love. You know, it's funny you talked about like restriction again and the thing just, I'm thinking of preparing, you know, and the most common thing that people prepare his food in and they prepare cans and cans and cans of food, but still they eat so much of that food that the best way to prepare, the best way to prepare would be to start to eat less and, and learn how to live at 1700 calories. You know, and learn how to live with the people around you. Because if you're going to spend like two months in the bunker or an a bug out location or whatever, you're nuts, some like asshole to your kids and your friends and family and people with you.

Speaker 2:          02:11          One of the things that happens to people, this is really fascinating when, when disasters do strike, cause everyone gets a lot friendlier. You know, and this is one thing that I've experienced myself this week because, uh, when we got evacuated, it was two 30 in the morning on Thursday and there was fire a rock's throw from my house and I'm not talking a little bit of fire, I'm talking to this hundreds of acres of fire. I mean it was just roaring over. We started see houses, started seeing the gas lines explode, houses burst into flames and it was right down the street. So we're seeing this and uh, you know, we're, we're, we're, we got outside, we're in the driveway, the neighbors come over, everyone's talking, what are you going to do? I go, we're getting the fuck outta here. And he's like, have they given the evacuation orders?

Speaker 2:          02:54          I said, no we haven't, but I go, it's right there man. I go, we got to go. I go, if it, if we're wrong and we come back in, the house is still here. That's okay, but you want to get out of these things quickly because they can turn south quickly, but there was a sense of camaraderie and community that that happens and then quite a few of us all went to the same hotel, including my friend Tom Segura and his wife and his family went to this hotel too with some of my friends from this neighborhood. We're all there huddled in together and but there was, there was an people were little extra friendly. There was a, and this is like a, there was the same kind of feeling after nine 11 when I was in New York City. There was, people are a little more friendly.

Speaker 1:          03:33          We felt that during the ice storm back in the day, people were, like I say, I saying the street that we live on, and then they go, well, who's got a wood burning stove? And they go, oh, Roger does come over. Then people would go to Roger's house and all of a sudden all these neighbors that just wave at each other, we're all at Roger's house by the wood burning stove, going back to the houses to get blankets, planning, sleeping arrangements, planning food arrangements, and assessing each other, giving each other their personal space and learning to how to speak to each other in a respective manner that we might have to do this for several days. Yeah. Through the bed, through tragedy, a sense of community was built somewhat or reinforced for a brief moment in time, which made going back to our regular lives on that street better. Yeah. You know? Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          04:29          If you ever read, uh, Sebastian younger's tribe, nope. Nope. It's a great book. And he kind of talks about that, about how in part situations of extreme stress and when people are really pushed, um, those people bond together and they find that these are the happiest times of their life. People that even go to war, they find that they missed the comradery of the bunker. They miss the miss, the camaraderie of being in the trenches. They missed the camaraderie of being together, huddled up, not knowing what's going to happen in the future, but co counting and depending upon each other for their very lives.

Speaker 1:          05:03          So that's a thing that happens in very, very, very busy kitchens. Yeah. Uh, you know, a bunch of no education guys out of cooking school, working, uh, uh, difficult restaurant line. You know, we're working six guys, six, four burners every night. A difficult menu with a difficult chef and a very busy restaurant tho those, those hours, you know, from 6:00 PM till 10:00 PM at night, like it's intimate. It's intimate. Like, you know, like my nose, you're bending over to get into the stove. They get a chicken. No, I'm grabbing something out of the fridge. My nose is in your, but your nose is in my, but uh, you know, I, I need your knife. You need my knife. Uh, it's very, very, very close. Quarter is often like some of my strongest relationships. Some of his strongest relationships

Speaker 2:          05:58          are, you know, the bond that I've built with guys that I've cooked on in lines, whether in Europe or here are unbreakable. You know, these guys got your back. Tony talked a lot about that, you know? Yeah. I think people are better off when they're struggling. Yeah, I really do. I mean, I think they're better off when they're there. They're, you know, when life creates challenges and there's, there's things to overcome and there's difficulties to get through and there's real pressure involved in these, and there's physical activity involved in these pressures as well. It's growing on the Galley, the century, and the cat of nine tails looming over you.
