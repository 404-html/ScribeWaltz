Speaker 1:          00:01          Gear for Steve Bay and Francis and Ghana was so scary when the light is a John Jones. Ooh, I don't know man. I don't think they've reached any sort of conclusion. I don't know if, um, they have some sort of an excuse. I don't know when the trial is. I think it's a, it's got to be some time coming up soon, but it hasn't been in the news. See if you can find out when the trial is. It's going to be interesting to see what, what they say or what they think it could be that tell you the craziest rumor about it. Talked about it on the podcast before. The craziest rumor was everybody knows John Likes to party. I'm not throwing them under the bus. I mean, he's even joked around, he said, uh, to DC when DC was talking shit. He's like, I beat you after I did cocaine.

Speaker 1:          00:44          Yeah. I mean, which is fucking hilarious. But the craziest rumor was that they cut Korea teen with cocaine. It's one of the things they cut cocaine with and that they use some cheap Chinese creatine that was steroid tainted, which is apparently very common. Apparently there's a lot of uh, Korea teens and different things that you take. They have trace amounts of steroids. It'll show up in a test because the same vats that they make that shit in, they make steroids in and they make everything again. Then making them in China, these really shitty bulk places and you'll occasionally get tainted supplements happens all the time. Maybe they were purposely tainted. That could happen too. We talked about that. The greatest creotine ever. Yeah. This should yokes me out. Yeah, right. Yeah. Probably. Maybe that's just the way to sell steroids. You just sell creating. But what's interesting, it says California State Athletic Commission, right? Because it was in California. So who gets to decide? California gets to decide, is that how it works? Cause it's the California State Athletic Commission. So they apparently get to decide what happens in his future.

Speaker 1:          01:52          Oh, you Sada, you saw if found guilty this time, he faces up to a four year ban. Holy Shit. What's the minimum now? I don't know. I mean it really depends on whether or not he's got an actual excuse. If he could get that fucking deal or to get them some coke and it's got the steroids in that, I bet you'd never, the problem is you would only have a decent excuse. You wouldn't, you wouldn't have, you wouldn't be exonerated. There would still be some sort of a penalty. Wait a minute. Match. Did you say they're cutting in China? That cutting creatine with coke or what? Steroids. They're using creatine to cut cocaine. So if you buy cocaine, see if you've got a kilo of cocaine. You want stretch that shit out, man. Kalona quarter. Oh, I got the thing brow super fucking muscle. Dick creatine and Super Muscle Dick Create team has some steroids in it and so when they're cutting this cocaine with this Korean team that has steroids in it, he's snorting the coat.

Speaker 1:          02:49          This is he not meaning John Jones a person. I'm making this up, right? This is, I don't know what not your cap. No, no. This is the room. Could be. The rumor is that this has been to task positive that he did at coke and it had creating in it and the creative team had steroids in it. The rumor is that is what people think could be a possibility because if John Likes to party and we know John Likes to party, it is entirely possible that he might have partied and that he might've just had a little bit of that and in that was this creating cause like if you think about it, they're cutting with all kinds of different stuff. Right. They cut it with, I mean I'm not a cocaine doctor, but I gotta imagine they take some white shit that looks like coke and he can make more coke.

Speaker 1:          03:31          Right. That's what the cutting is. Right. But to cut it with Korea team, apparently it's comic. We looked it up. We actually do with it. Yeah. Damn. I thought you were saying that he was taking Korea team and it had, it was tainted with steroids. No, because that would be better for him if that was the case. That would be good because that way you could take that creatine to Usada and you'd have to have it on a list of shit you were taken. He said, look, it's just says it's Korean team. It's all I took and they tested. They're like, oh shit, this does have steroids in it. And then they'll go and find another one that's like from the same that they can find like the VAT numbers. I guess they'll find one independently, hopefully from a store if they test that. And if they find a trace amount of steroids and that.

Speaker 1:          04:11          And that's what God, um, a dirty bird to means. He got off of that. That's how he got off. He didn't take any steroids, just took some fucking over the counter normal supplement that wasn't supposed to have steroids in it. And then, um, he tested positive. He was stunned. And you've looked at Tim, he doesn't live, he even lifts weights. He doesn't even remotely look like a guy he used to steroids and they tested the stuff that they found just randomly in the store and that tested positive. So he only got a short amount of a suspension. Hmm. Yeah, it was pretty quick. Like six months or something like that. But even then, if you didn't do anything wrong, why would you get six months? And so you're saying that the steroids are in Korea team on accident, not like they're not doing it on purpose, right?

Speaker 1:          04:53          No. Well, here's the thing. This is just speculation, right? All I'm here, I'm hearing a rumor, right? But the speculation is that these labs where they make creatine, they also make a gang of other things, right? They'll cook up some steroids for ya or whatever the fuck the order is, right? And they're not cleaning those vats out, right? So if they're just pouring another bag and they pour out the steroids and they pour back creatine in there for the next batch and they're mixing everything up, it's entirely possible to trace amounts of those steroids are getting into that stuff. When we first started doing alpha brain, we had um, some of the early versions tested and when we got the stuff mixed from a place, the place didn't do a very good job of cleaning out their equipment and we had vitamins in our alpha brain, the weren't in there.

Speaker 1:          05:43          We had some stuff that's not supposed to be in there. So when we tested and we found trace amounts, we had a switch. What we're doing, we had to change how we, how we have the things manufactured. That's a super common thing when you're dealing with these overseas laboratories that are making tea all your shit together. So that's one possibility. Another possibility that I've said before, the lot of people say I'm fucking crazy. Somebody could have given him something, somebody could have given him something to fuck with them. Somebody could have not liked him. So we could have done that too. I'm not saying that's what happened, but I'm saying you have to take into consideration all the possibilities. If John is telling the truth and he's totally stunned by this, there's a lot of different possibilities and one of them could easily be somebody giving it to them.

Speaker 1:          06:24          It also could be that he took steroids. That's possible too. I don't know. If you owned a creating company, you'd kind of want, you're creating to be you. You guys are making steroids there too. Right? Okay, cool. Can we use the same? That sucks. That shit. And then you could always just say, hey, you know what? I didn't, I don't know what it's true. Yeah. You know they Perth, those Dick Pills, apparently those gas station Dick Pills, they have like a generic Viagra on him. That's why they work so well. I know that. He's just used to say, that's your honor, your honor. We, they, we didn't know that. They use the same vats. Yeah, they do that and they also put steroids in those things to do. You know, Brian Red Band was the first one to call that Jon Jones had take a dick pills. That's why I tested positive ray ban.

Speaker 1:          07:07          Put it together in his head because he does coke. He's like, look, you do cookie. Dick doesn't work. Do Your Dick doesn't work. You take those gas station Dick Pills. He probably took one of those pills. He goes, I take those pills. I feel like a fucking animal. He's like, I feel like I've got steroids in me. I'm like, really? He goes, yeah, you get real aggressive. Dick is hard as a fucking piece of metal. I'm like, okay, all right. Turned out he was right. Hmm. That's crazy. And it was the same thing with Anderson Silva. When Anderson Silva tested positive, it was from some sort of Chinese dick pill stuff. Hmm. And they found it and they tested it red. That does go hook. He's done it. He doesn't do it all the time, but he's done it. So he knows what it's like to party. And that's what he was saying.

Speaker 1:          07:45          He's like, I know what it's like if you're partying and he's like, your Dick doesn't work. He's like, he parties, right? Well he probably did cause he tested positive for coke. He's like, you probably does that red band totally nailed it. Or maybe he was doing ecstasy. People take my Agora on ecstasy, you know? Yeah. It could be that too. Yeah. Looked he, he's a wild motherfucker and he likes to party. The question is, did he actually take a steroid with the intention to cheat? That's what we don't know. He says he didn't. I wished there was a weight that you a hundred Blake, 100% could tell someone's lying 100% your watch, that Black Mirror episode where everything's been videotaped with her contact lenses. Yes. So they just like reviewing everything they've said. Yeah. That freaked me out. That's coming.
