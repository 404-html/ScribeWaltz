Speaker 1:          00:00          It was a good fight for as long as it landed on his last brother. One of the cool things that we've gotten is to be ability to hang out casually with these fighters. Like having just breakfast with Randy, seeing him having with enough times with you that I remember one time I was like going into a buffet or whatever or the hotel, like free breakfast and like looking around and just having him going, hey, come sit with me. I'm like, oh, okay. Just like, oh, you're just such sought after it. I'm just like, I'm talking about nothing. But some of my favorites were in Chicago. Do going to the weigh ins and then like, let's go to the show and then just junk drive in with clay. Guido am like, I'll drive you just, it's his city, it's his city. And he's like, come with me.

Speaker 1:          00:44          We're like, okay. And you white knuckling, holding onto the front seat as he's swerving with a brown paper bag drives like he fights and I'm just like, I accept that. So either way cause it mattered and he would just go and for it on these highways that he knows and then I believe the rain and it was just like, I was just like so fun. Yeah. Another one that I remember early on early on, John Jones, he wasn't anything then. It's four and oh, maybe something like that. Um, meeting him, uh, talking about shit, and I could talk about this now because it's not no longer a banned substance in the UFC, but like, uh, talking about weed and was like, yo, let's smoke bro. He wasn't anything, it wasn't anything. And just going like, he was like, who's got wait, am I, oh, Rogan's got a piece in his hotel room and texting you flip phone, texting you back when it wasn't cool.

Speaker 1:          01:38          You don't have to have like hip to have a flip phone where it was like, that's all anybody had. That's how long ago. And then just go on. Like maybe it's that, maybe it was early, uh, iPhone, but like just going, hey man, are you up? And you're like, yeah, I'm kind of and go to sleep. And was like, Fuck John, I think he's doesn't want us up there. And then be like, no, no, let's go. He's got the weed. Let's go. Because some fan gave it to us, right? You had this fucking like tin foil of weed and um, and just knock on your door and you're like, what? And you're like, uh, you were retired. And it was like, um, do you have that? We'd like to come on, I want to go to sleep, man. John, when the smoke and you're like, you looked at us, who opened the door fully looked at me and this young fighter and you were like, come on in.

Speaker 1:          02:17          And we all smoked pot together and this hotel room and fucking wherever it was, I think Montreal, Ashley's Montreal. Yeah. Yeah. And it just a fun time. And then seeing this guy move on to become the baddest motherfucker on the planet. But we also had a conversation with him about, I was, I wanted him to go to a different camp. That's right. He was training in fucking youtube videos in New York with his buddies in a garage. You too. Good. I'm Mike, you should be in a real cash. That's right. We had that over weed in a hotel room. He's like, you really think so. I go, I know. So I know. I go, you only have a certain amount of time in this thing. I go and your time should be invested with a real coach. Who's going to hone your skills. I go, you, you can be an all time.

Speaker 1:          02:56          Great man. Wow. Yeah, I remember telling him that and he's like, you really think so. I go, I know. So I know. So you, you really got to move on. I forgot about that part of how influential was that in the fucking future of mixed martial arts. So I hope it helped. You know, he did. He went to Winkle, John a hunk, uncle junk eventually. I mean, he'd probably be what? We might've done it anyway. He might, who knows? But, uh, I think it was a good conversation to have with a young guy. You know, I was like, listen man, you, you, you, you have real talent. Like you could really be something, but you gotta be, you gotta be coached by guys who are going to find out your tendency technique isn't worth, isn't going to go take you that far. Well, I mean fucking, he was so good.

Speaker 1:          03:38          Who knows how far he might've been a world champion, even with the camp that he was in. He's so good and his wrestling is so powerful and he's so physically talented, but it made a big difference for him to go to Jackson's and be able to train on a regular basis with world class fighters being there on a daily basis with Carlos condit who is, you know, at the top of his game back then. And I mean Keith Jardeen and they just had a massive, they had ruined tailors, the, they called it the ring of fire where you would go five rounds of sparring with to get ready for a fight with a different high level. I mean, highest level fighter. So like Nate Marquardt like cool. That was around one get out of here at Giardia and you come in and now I just finished a fucking route and they'd walk quite now I got go with kicked Jardeen cool.

Speaker 1:          04:29          Round three charge didn't get out Jon Jones who come in and it's like, what? I mean the training you got there. Correct. Johnson's camp. We're like, well yeah. I mean look, there's a reason why so many extremely high level fighters are coming out of there. And then Rashad Evans was there as well too. And Rashad had a real problem with John Coming there because Rashad was like, hey, this guy's in my weight class, but what are you going to do? I have one guy, he's way class. Right. It's an issue. Yeah. And then, you know, Rishad and John became friends. They did fight. Is that they would, yes, they fought and John beat the shit out of him. I don't even remember that. They thought after they had a big falling out because Rashad was upset that, you know, John Wound up, John Wound up getting a title shot, uh, and beat shogun because were shod, got injured.

Speaker 1:          05:16          Rashad was supposed to get the title shot, John Steps in and they were friends at the time and then somewhere along the line then the trash talk started, you know, I'll fight Rashad, fuck it. And then it was like, man, I thought we were friends and then, oh yeah, that's back when it was like, you know, you guys can fight as front and center, but you don't have to like be at enemies. Everybody fight. It's a sport and it's a money thing. And then when John beat him, it was a real drubbing and it was a five rounds. It was a decision and uh, it was a real clear cut, unanimous decision. He did some crazy shit to him, like step in elbow to the face. I kind of do remember this one now, and this was John when he was developing, John Wasn't even John, like the John that knocked out DC.

Speaker 1:          06:02          I remember him when he sang it in fights that I didn't really ever see this where the fighters, where he would talk about after wins, talking about the holes, the fuck ups he had more than the, what he did right was most guys would be braggadocious, but I love that I did, but it was like he was upset at things that went wrong. Yeah, I guess I got to cover that up. That could get exposed. You know, John's a fucking smart data, me as reckless and chaotic as he is. And you know, I've said this before that I don't know what causes that kind of recklessness, but there is a direct correlation between traumatic brain injury, brain damage, and impulsive behavior and recklessness. It's a fact. It's well researched. It's well documented in neuroscience. They know that this, this is a, there's a connection. I don't want to exonerate him from his past behavior, but we see that in football players, we see that and BMX riders that go crazy and fucking land on their head a bunch of times.

Speaker 1:          06:57          People, they get crazy. Wow. They get wild and impulsive and it's just a fact. It's just a part of the game. You know, they, they, those people that engage in any kind of an activity where you bring gets rattled on a regular basis, you are way more likely to do ridiculous things that don't make any sense. Yeah, it does. It's what I said about John. Have you talked to John about it? You know, um, and you know, I know John was upset with me after one of those things before we actually did a podcast together. He was upset and I said, listen, man, I have to be.
