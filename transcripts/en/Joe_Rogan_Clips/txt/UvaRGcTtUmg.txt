Speaker 1:          00:00          But you're definitely feeling that tobacco, you're feel it's, it's doing something to your system and they say it actually has a cognitive enhancing function that's similar to nootropics and coffee as well. That'll like it. It actually can make you perform better in tests if you smoked cigarettes or if you smoke a cigar. And writers always say that like, I know a lot of people who write like writers for sitcoms and stuff like that. Those guys always smoke cigarettes when they write and they say they can't write without smoking. Steven King said that it's like their weed. Yeah, well it does have something going on man, but it's instead of like, it's not, it's to me it's more like amped than it is creative. We'd is super creative. Weed makes me think of thoughts while I write them down on my, I can't even claim that. That's not even my thought.

Speaker 1:          00:47          That's weeds thought. You know what I mean? Like I would have never just leave me by myself with no drugs in a, in a notebook. I would have never come up with that idea. But the weeds like, hey man, listen to this. You know the weed weed is way more of a uh, like an idea steroid. I believe it too. I see people who don't smoke weed and they write and I'm like who you're so brave out there out there with no helmet you've got no life preserver on and now it's crazy legal everywhere. This amazing this recreational weed in California. It's insane. He just walked nine states now. Yeah. Crazy. I think 18 states have league illegal medical and nine states have legal recreational, nice juice. It's mass. Yeah it's a wave. It's going across the whole country. It's changing everything and it's good.

Speaker 1:          01:39          And you know what the next wave is MTMA MTMA therapy for PTSD patients has unprecedented results. Maps is involved in this, what does it multiple, the Multiple Disciplinary Association for Psychedelic studies or something like that. Maps is a amazing a really above board organization that is at the forefront of legalization of psychedelics and of psychedelic research and they'd been involved in studies with soldiers and they have amazing results with this stuff. Mdm May just lets you forgive yourself and lets you forget everything. It reprograms your brain had reprogram, lets you forgive other people in your life. It changes. It could. One head of MDM, MDM and Dma, that always confuses me, Molly and said it's a lot easier. One hint can change your taste in music forever for ever. I believe it because before aggregate it, the first time I did it was 1997 and before that, how was a DJ at this point? And I couldn't stand tech. Now I hated techno music so much and I was a DJ and anytime a girl went on stage and she was a tech Nigger, I'm like, this is because I played drums for real. So when you listen to techno and house, it's like it. That's the most basic dump. Every song,

Speaker 2:          03:00          every fucking drum beat to Sam. I couldn't accept it as a musician and most musicians feel that way about tech now. And um, I went to a birthday party at the key club in Hollywood and I walk in and upstairs is techno in downstairs in the like little bottom club is hip hop. And it was a birthday party and everyone was downstairs and me and my buddy Rick, we walk in and we're standing at the edge of the techno Floyd and there's like all these dudes just like dancing by themselves. They're just like mental cases, right. And I was just standing there looking at him going, what the fuck is wrong with these people? Oh my God. So I went downstairs or playing hip hop, like that's what I want to hear at clubs. I want to hear hip hop at a club. I want to dance with a girl, not by myself, you know, so I'm downstairs and then they start passing around some Molly and some say we want to do it and I'll never forget that that first one was blue.

Speaker 2:          03:50          I'm like, I dunno, I dunno. So I took it, me and my buddy both took it and it hit us that that first hit just hits you like a fucking ton of bricks. We go upstairs and we're on the dance floor dancing like morons, dude. And we're looking at each other go, you get it? I get it, I get it. I get it, and from that point on, you got all into trance. Yeah. From that point, it wasn't just like that night. It changed my musical taste right in one hit, and I had a friend at the club who was a total rnb duty, hate a techno, and he would talk shit. When I played tech and I got one day, you're going to do some modeling and you're going to be all into technical as a fog you. That'll never happen. I can't stand this music. He starts dating the raver check like six months later at the club, some raver check, he ends up at a ray, he ends up dropping some Molly, he starts coming in and bringing all these new tech, no cds, and he's all into full blown and the trends in tech now, just one hint, this is the real, the real

Speaker 1:          04:49          problem. It's illegal. So when you get it from someone, you don't know what the fuck you getting. That's the real problem with Molly. This is a real problem with Mtma. It's also the dosage. You don't know what the dosage is supposed to be. Look, you can overdose on alcohol and alcohol's everywhere, but everybody knows what the dose of alcohol is, was you go to a bar and you get a shot of Jack Daniels. You know what that is? It's not like sometimes you get a shot of Jack, Jen, Jack Daniels in his Jack Daniels. Sometimes you get it in, it's super fucking moonshine is 15 times stronger and you die. That's the problem with heroin. Yes. A problem with a lot of things. The real problem with MDM may seems to be that it's illegal. That's the real problem and what they're finding is that there's great benefits if it's used correctly.

Speaker 1:          05:31          I mean, anything can be abused, but that doesn't mean we should make it illegal and what they want to do. I think their, their timeline, it's somewhere around 2021 making it legal for, for therapy. It's going to change the world. It's going to change everything. It's going to change the way people feel about the past is going to change the way people interact with each other. You're going to know just by people's behavior, whether or not they've ever done it right. You know where it comes from. We're MTMA comes from the part of it, the active ingredient that takes you a, that just makes you plant, right? Where's that planet? It's in Thailand. Crazy. Either Thailand or it's like, uh, what's, uh, Cambodia in Cambodia. It's like the bark, like something about that, like the root of a tree trunk or something. Yes. It has something to do with the tree James pulling it up, but it becomes very dangerous for those people.

Speaker 1:          06:21          Right? Like all that the trafficking becomes crazy. Yeah. There's they fuck up for us. Like for us are being chopped down. I've just, just for the people being murdered, it's like, it's heavy duty stuff for us. Um, I dunno, I googled it and just look at images and that's what popping up. Maybe it was a place Mtma Cambodia trees at Sassafras. Okay. Maybe that is Sassafras and SEF. Rolly Sassafras. Yeah, I guess it Sassafras Dude. It's a whatever. Whatever that plan is. They take the see if that just Google vice, uh, the making of ecstasy. Cause I'm pretty sure vice to this. But could you go with that please? I think, uh, vice had a special on that. I wonder what would happen if he just ate it raw. I wonder, can you do that? Um, is there a special,

Speaker 3:          07:12          okay,

Speaker 1:          07:13          what does it say?

Speaker 3:          07:14          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:15          The truth about ecstasy. Yeah. So is there some sort of a vice episode where they grow this stuff anyway? Um, this should be something that's not distributed by criminals were in ski masks like you've seen in this video. Should it be something distributed by stores and they should be doctors? And if you wanted it, you could have a rave where you even have medical centers in the rave. We keep people from overdosing. Yeah. When, when they're the transitionary period from people going from drugs being totally illegal to some drugs having massive benefits. Like if you're, you go to a club, right? And everyone there is, c'mon, we're doing shots were doing shots, the whole fucking bars getting wasted and drunk. Everybody's fine with that. But you're not fine with a club where everybody does a small amount of ecstasy. Well, why can't you do that?

Speaker 1:          08:01          Well, that's drugs. Well, the other one's drugs too. He just used to those drugs. Once we get past that hurdle, and it might take a whole generation before people get used to places where you can go, one drug gets you violent, one drug makes you want to have sex, but listen, you're not going to stop that drug. Here's my point. It's a powerful, really useful drug. People going to find out about it. It's an amazing experience. They're going to do it. So what's the best way to handle that? Best way to handle is make it safe, make it legal, make it regulated so they know what actually is in each one of these fucking pills and you're not getting it from some pimp or some asshole or some fucking crazy dude is stuffed in and a balloon put it up as asshole and made it across the border with it.

Speaker 1:          08:39          You don't know where the fuck you're getting this stuff. All sorts of shit. All sorts of shit. Amphetamines and all sorts of crazy shit, and people die from it because they don't know what the fuck is in there. Here it is. Yeah. Um, okay. It says a boy and load a, p. R. E w p. H. E n. O. M. Trees. Murray prove Phnom trees and Cambodia and the, they're found in Cambodia's. Oh, Sassafras. The factory has been set up to distill Sassafras oil, a process by boiling the roots and the trunk of the exceptionally rare plant. Oh, they're really rare trees to, wow. How crazy is that? How many of these fucking trees? Or like in the middle of the rain forest? So we don't know about.
