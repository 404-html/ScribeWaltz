Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. Well, if you're going to do Sam Tripoli's podcast, tin foil hat, just understand that it's a different kind of conspiracy theory podcasts. It's like his big foot psychic, like those kinds of questions and expect to get a contact high from the room. I just wanted to ask you about that George Saint Pierre stuff with you or foes? I think it's head trauma. Yeah. Yeah. Or did he, did he have sex with those hot green check? Maybe did, but if I had a gas, the way he was describing things is very similar to the way people describe things when they've experienced success of head trauma. Really? Yeah, because he missed his time. He's memory's not, not good. Like he'll get home and then he'll have groceries that he bought and left in his trunk and not even realize it. And it'll go out to his trunk and the rotten and he's like, I don't even remember going to this door.

Speaker 1:          00:49          Wow. The alien he's got, I think he's got this idea that this, these glitches in his mind, it's not a fucking coincidence that the guy got punched in the head. I think they did a stat before the Bisping fight. I think it was more than 800 times. Wow. You got hit in the head and his UFC career, forget about all the gym training. Forget about all the other stuff. Right. And forget about the fights outside of the UFC that he had before he got into the UFC when he was in Tko remember? Yeah. So he's experienced a lot of head trauma. One of the symptoms of head trauma is memory loss issues and mean. Um, and Hendricks hit him hard a lot. Yes, he did. Yeah. And he's only one guy that hit him hard. I mean, a lot of guys hit him hard that Sarah scrambled is fucking brain and a lot of guys hit him hard.

Speaker 1:          01:37          And that's just outside of sparring. I mean, that's us outside of everything else that he's done sparring with Rory Mcdonald and Wonderboy and all the other guys that he had to spar with. Yeah. I think that's most likely what it is. People who have been, who've experienced a lot of head trauma. That's one of the real problems with it is. Um, um, what does, what does the dude from the Chicago bears, the famous guy, the fucking quarterback from the bears? Yes. Mcmahon was on the cover of sports illustrated talking about it, but he'll be in the middle of his, um, his living room holding these keys. He had no idea how it's keys got in his hand, doesn't know where he's going. Wow. Where am I going? Like, why am I standing there holding my keys? You just forget. Stop. Scary. Yeah, there's really scared actions.

Speaker 1:          02:21          Well, that's why it's been so impressive that you, with your long fight career, you kickbox do box. Do you know you had a lot of MMA fights? I think I learned early on with the kickboxing and boxing and I looked at the older guys and listen to them talk and went, I don't want to be that guy. So I started paying attention to the defense. I started watching films on great boxers with great defense, footwork, head movement, you know, all that sort of stuff. And just, and I, and it was the key. I never got hit with anything I didn't see. I think you have sturdy jeans too. You've got them. Croatian gene helps. I'm sure it helps. So I'm, I, I'm the smallest correlation on the planet. When you run into the Croatians are all huge, like Steve Cro, cop type characters, steep
