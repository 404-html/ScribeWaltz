Speaker 1:          00:00          I feel like my enemies the clock and I was a lot of stuff I want to do in my life and my enemy is the clock. Do you feel like you live in the moment enough? Absolutely. You do. I do. Because that would be the worry, right? Like if you're constantly worrying about, damn, 20 years, I'm going to be 70 30 years, I'm going to be Haiti. If you keep doing that, like there, there are people that look ahead too much and don't just, I've, I've talked to people that are 20 like, fuck, I can't believe I'm 20 and like, listen Motherfucker, you just turned 20 dude, relax. You know, just 20, you're a baby. Naw Man, I'm going to be fucking 30 and 10 years. Like you shut the fuck up. You're 20 now. I use it as a motivator and I remember, I remember when I was, when I was starting out, I was 21 years old.

Speaker 1:          00:46          This is a crazy story. Uh, I just got dropped from our record label. I was signed to a record label called delicious vinyl. How did you do as a, I had a rap record on tuition rapper. I was a rapper signed to delicious with Tone Loc and Young Mc. Oh, get the fuck out of here. So my album doesn't get picked. I don't get picked up for a second album. And I moved to New York City. I have two things on my resume. Kiddie pool attendant, cause I was a Kiddie pool attendant and rapper. So I'm staying on my friend's couch, living on his couch with his roommate and he tells me on Monday I got to get out of the apartment. So instead of going to look for a new apartment over the weekend, I go to my friend's Bachelor Party on the Jersey Shore. I'm at the Bachelor Party, I'm getting a drink at the bar and I see this girl.

Speaker 1:          01:30          I started chatting with her. She asked me where I live. I told her actually as of Monday, I have nowhere to go. She takes out a Napkin. She writes her address on the Napkin. I'm 21 years old and she says, if it's an emergency on Monday and you're stuck, you can come live with me. Monday comes, I get kicked out of my friend's apartment. I have nowhere to go. I'm like, this is an emergency. I take out the Napkin and I live with this girl and her roommate for six months. It turns out that her father is a big entrepreneur business man. He owns a piece of the Yankees, dislike monster mogul. I write this song for the New York Knicks called go New York, go and it becomes a big success. You remember that song? No, no, no. Okay. That's okay. That's okay. I'm not a sports fan.

Speaker 1:          02:16          That's fine. It becomes a big hit and I just realized that there's an opportunity to write theme songs for all these professional sports teams, but I don't have a penny to go in the studio to do the demos, to shop them to the team. So I need money. So I go to this music guy and he says, I'll give you $10,000 to go and do these songs for 10% of everything you make for the rest of your life. He wants to buy me like a style the rest of your life. I'm 21 he's like, the rest of your life. Everything you do, I will invest in you own an airplane business. He owns 10% yes. Forever. Yes. You have to kill him then. Yes. Yeah, you have to kill that guy, but I need the 10 grand. So I say, I'll take it. So before I take it, I go to this girl's father for advice, this business mogul.

Speaker 1:          03:00          Then I'm living with her and I sit down, I go to this guy's apartment again. I'm 21 he's got in his apartment, he's got a swimming pool, artwork, like fancy fuck women. He's macked out, man. It's like I'd never seen anything like this in Manhattan, in Manhattan. I'm just setting the stage of the conversation and I go in and I tell him the story about the 10 the 10 grand and he says to me, I would trade, this is exactly what he said to me. I will trade everything that I have for you to get out of my daughter's life.

Speaker 1:          03:39          Exactly. Outweighed everything I have for the one thing that you have. And I'm like, man, I'm fucking broke. What he taught me, I go, what's that? And he said, youth, because he had already gone through the journey, even though he had everything, he already had gone through the process. He wasn't that 20 year old that you're talking about that whatever he had gone through it, he had it all. He he will. He missed the process. The journey of being you coming up at 20 and not know like you know here you are. But it was the, those were the years man. The first fight, the first this like that. That's what, that's what makes you like so and that stuck with me man. At 21 years old. It stuck with me and realize that like, man, I got to enjoy the process and it's really never rubbed off on me in front of me.

Speaker 1:          04:30          Oh, well why didn't that guy, how old was this guy at the time? The old rich dude, he was, let's see, he must've been in his sixties. Why? They just do shit, do a bunch of shoot day lounging around his fucking swimming pool. Did he did, he had an amazing, he was 20. He had an amazing life. He had an amazing life. So what did you wind up doing? Uh, he said the SEC, the second part of that conversation, he said, do you, um, will you make this work on your own? I said, I think I can. He said, I didn't ask if you can. He said, I, I said, he said, will you make it work? I said, I will. He said, and then go tell the guy to fuck off and make it and it goes and go make it work. And I did.

Speaker 1:          05:09          So how'd you get it funded that? Uh, I, I somehow got, I went to the Dallas Mavericks after the Knicks and told them that I convinced them to give me a $2,500 the next pay me, this is the crazy part of my life, but they gave me $2,500 to do the demo and then they bought the song for like $20,000 and that funded the rest of the business that I ultimately sold to a public company. Wow, that's crazy. And you almost gave away 10% of your whole life. That guy wanted 10% is a piece of shit. What a mother fucker like. That's a city like just business draws prisoners and I had no one to go to. I know he's taken advantage of a 21 year old kid who's just got some dreams and need some cash and 10 grand to him. It's probably nothing.

Speaker 1:          05:57          I called my father and my father owned the plumbing supply house in Mineola Long Island and I during this time in my thing and my father said, you know, I love him to death, but he's like, you know, do it. Do what you think is best. Don't, he just didn't, you know, I didn't know where to turn to. I had no one to turn to. Yeah. Don't, don't give up 10% of your life. Right. That was just crazy that someone asks for that. But you hear things like, I mean, this is similar to what they do in the music business, like how the music business treats artists. They essentially sign you to these contracts and then take a piece of everything. They take a piece of, if you do a movie, they take a piece of your live performances, your merchandise sales, everything. They just say, look, we'll, we'll help you out a little bit, but you know, we want you, right?

Speaker 1:          06:46          Yeah. I mean, at least you were in a contract though. But there's some creepy contracts that they used to do in the old days of Hollywood that were similar to that. Right? They just take a PCF forever. Yeah. But you know, when I signed my music deal, I didn't care. I was like, you can take whatever you want, man. Get me on MTV. Right? Of course. Yeah. Because, well, that's the whole idea. The word, the reason why these exploitation contracts work is because in the beginning you're just so desperate and what you have is what they don't have. You have talent, right? You have, as you're creative, you're young and full of energy and you've got something exciting that people want to look at. And so what they do is they go, oh, you, what could we gotta fucking, we got to wait through the door, but we want 75% of the profits.

Speaker 1:          07:27          We want a little bit of this and, and you don't get any money back until we recoup our money that we spent on executives and parking and car leases. And they calculate all that shit. How much the fucking building costs, how much the electricity, all that stuff. They that you've seen those I'm sure. Oh yes. Contracts. They're fucking, I've signed them. I've sat, you know, in my own way. Yeah. But um, you know, it's part of the process and no leverage, no leverage. That's the thing. They've got the leverage, but now and now they don't have delivered, but they still figured out a way to pull it off. It's really weird because who the fuck is buying an albums now? No. Right? No one. Right yet these record companies are still figuring out how coiling on do you like a lamprey suck blood out. There's still staying alive and they're fat fingers driving their fat Mercedes Benz.

Speaker 1:          08:20          They know how to do it. They just figured out a way to grab people that are just just getting poppin, you know, and just sign it and then figured out a way to get in with these fucking streaming companies. Have you paid attention to that shit? A little bit. Yeah. That's the darkest. It's even darker than the music distribution because the artists get like no money point. Oh, oh, Steven Tyler was talking about it with me. It's just, he was explaining it and there's a, there's, it's the company's actually, or the organization's actually called M m. A what is it? Something, what did, what did it stand for? Musicians for, uh, some, some sort of an act where they're trying to stop the streaming companies from ripping off these artists' music modernization act. Yeah. It's dark. Yeah. But it's along the same lines. It's like people figuring out a way to just take something from somebody.
