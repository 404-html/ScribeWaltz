Speaker 1:          00:00          No, that privacy always comes up. People always talk about it. And I guess I keep going back to my same point, which was I, I don't see people like with pitchforks and torches going down a complaint of Jeff Bezos that right. You know, Amazon's collecting massive amounts of data or you know, t mobile and sprint and all these are our mapping our locations as we move around. I just don't see it. I mean, that probably raised nobody's interest for the most part. You know, that article that you just pulled up. Um, and I, I, you know, I guess in part it's because we, again, we, we become kind of used to it, custom to it, so, so fine. But, you know, what should we be worried about? Well, I tell you what we should, boy, what up mostly is a state sponsored activity by countries whose interests almost never aligned with ours now would include, China certainly includes Russia.

Speaker 1:          00:47          Who was Iran, the shit that they're doing. China has a, a policy, um, information domination, right? Which means they've determined that the next war, the next modern large scale war is going to be one by whoever has control over information. So where are they putting all their resources? China knows that they're not going to build a military that's going to be able to reach around the globe for the most part. Although they're, you know, they're beefing up their resources. What are they doing? It's cyber and it's space, right? So I know a lot of people were, were kicking the precedent in the ass and laughing about the space for us because it is funny, right? But the uniforms be amazing. But they, they talk about this, but China honestly believes and it's putting their resources into cyber and to space. What does that mean, wolf?

Speaker 1:          01:35          They're anti satellite technology that they've been developing and working on and continue to work on. The whole point of that is to take control of communications and surveillance abilities, whether it's ours or our allies in the event of something major that happens. So they would have the ability to shut off our SoundLens. No. And if you do that, then what does that mean? Well, that means you're blind. Right. And will suddenly walking around with campuses and maps, you know, trying to shoot an asthma, then figuring out where the hell, you know, the target is. So China is currently developing that, or they have developed something that they're working on it now. Yeah. They're working on it now. That developed, they developed some of it there. They're working to get the next generation. It's like every nation that has the resources and ability understands that and is doing the same.

Speaker 1:          02:15          It's not like we're not, what is their excuse was they shouldn't do, they don't have an excuse. They just, they understand. They have the right to do it. I mean, it's not like they, they, you know, as long as they don't use it right. And in an illegal way, they have the right to develop the tech. It's like there's no treaty that says you can't develop satellite technology. Right. There's, there's, there's the start tradies there's the nuclear, you know, conventions that we have with Russia, which is in a whole nother interesting topic because we're right now arguing with the Russians over over, uh, the, the latest, uh, nuke agreement that took place some time ago. Uh, it's, uh, coming up for renewal sometime soon in a year or two years from now. And the Russians had been cheating on a previous agreement. So we're, you know, now they try to say we're cheating on the new one.

Speaker 1:          02:59          And so that's an interesting thing to be watching. But the point being is that there's conventions that try to control the, the numbers for warheads or for delivery mechanisms, missiles or, or, or, uh, submarines, whatever bombers, but not for this new world. Cyberspace. Pentagons still trying to figure out what, uh, you know, a war, uh, means in cyberspace. Right. You know, how do you respond? What do you know, what, what's the threshold, you know, and then what's an appropriate response? Um, and so, well, maybe we'll get there. Maybe we'll start having these discussions and create treaties that will allow that. But right now from China's perspective, again, not to beat on China, but I'm much more concerned about China for our national security there a much bigger concern than Russia is. Russia is punching above its weight and potent, you know, Putin is a dick, no doubt about it.

Speaker 1:          03:48          Right? And they've doing what they always do, which is metal and democracy. That's been their methodology for ever since they've been around. Uh, but you know, that's small potatoes. They got the GDP of a small European country, you know, and when the oil prices, you know, are in the toilet, they really are suck and wind. So yeah, we gotta be concerned with Russia and understand that their interests are never aligned with ours. You know, for the most part may be. We tried to imagine they were with Syria and isis and everything, but Russia is only interest. Arrow was maintaining their leverage and increasing it and not, not losing their military foothold there. That was their primary interest. We mirror our values and we mirror our interest on other countries. And so we imagined that somehow we're all in this fight against Isis together. Eh, Horse Shit, you know, so, so yeah, China's a much bigger issue and we, and we should be focused on that and to some degree this administration is, so that's where I say, look, you can't just keep complaining and bitching and moaning because you don't like president Trump.

Speaker 1:          04:49          There's certain things that are going on that you should be willing to say that. Okay, that makes sense. Maybe I don't like the messenger, but that part of it makes sense. Is it his personal life? I mean, it was it because of his dealings with China from the business world that he understands it better, that he's more concerned with the, the imbalance of the, the trade. I think what happened was what do I know? This is speculation, so, hey, but I suspect that what happened was he came into it, um, focused on the trade imbalance. Right. And as he was sitting there and talking about the trade and balance more of the conversation from the National Security Council and from the agency and others in terms of saying, well yeah, this is part of the reason why and this is the longterm effects of, of their theft of intellectual property. This is why in part they've been successful in these areas. So I think there was probably more and more discussion talking about, uh, their, uh, economic espionage and theft of Ip and that became then an issue for him. Um, but I think initially, and still to this day, I think the big issue is just he wants to try to create a win in terms of the trade imbalance.

Speaker 2:          05:59          Russia seems to us here domestically leaks, speaking from, for myself, when, when I think about it, and I think about the, the narrative that's been sort of delivered to us is that Russia is this military danger. We're worried about Putin taking over other countries. We're worried about Putin's power, the way he kills dissidence, the way he kills political opponents and journalists. We think about China and even what the Walway arrests were like, Eh, no one seems to be concerned. It doesn't seem to light any bulbs over here.

Speaker 1:          06:33          Yeah, no, you're right. I don't know why that is, except, you know, Putin is more like a thug and he's a visual. Right, right. And also, I mean, look, he's, he's been very clear about wanting to try to rebuild the Soviet Union. So whether it's Crimea and the annexation of that, or where they're taking over eastern Ukraine, um, eh, or maintaining a position at Georgia, whatever it is, uh, you know, certainly, uh, you know, his attacks or the FSB is attacks overseas against, you know, dissidents and others. Um, yeah, he just more in your face. He's like Tony Soprano. Right, right. So you can look at that. China's always been sort of this thing, right. And Cello, China's fantastic. The history is amazing. You know, the places are incredible. I think, you know, we should be trading with China. We should be doing a huge amount of business with China.

Speaker 1:          07:21          We should, you know, clear the decks and try to the degree we can level the playing field, but we should also be pragmatic and realize what they do, you know, in terms of their, their theft of Ip. And so, you know, because that again, that probably won't change, but yeah, we absolutely should be dealing with China all the time. But I think that they've always kind of been viewed more in more of a sophisticated fashion maybe because Putin has just sort of in your face. Um, and he's, you know, he's good at it. He's very successful. He says he's a smart son of a bitch, but he's, I think he's pretty easy to read. Right? He's, he's thuggish and, um, he, you know, he longs for those days of the Soviet Union. So we should understand that everything he does is because of that is because he's, he, he would love to rebuild the Soviet Union.

Speaker 1:          08:07          And so we shouldn't be surprised by any sort of, you know, aggressive move that he makes against his, his neighbors. And we should always push back. Um, and to be fair, this administration, not to beat their drum, but the actions they've taken against Russia, despite the fact that you've got people calling him a puppet of Putin and are more significant than the previous administration took. Like what has he done the sanctions against, uh, you know, key individuals and companies within Russia as an example. Those are the toughest sanctions have been placed on Russia ever. Um, the provision of weapons and a, and assistance to the Ukrainians, right? That was something the previous administration said, no, not going to do that. You know, cause we don't, we don't want any blow back. Um, that's, that's a good thing, right. That should be done. Um, pushing back against them on the, on the 2011 nuke a deal.

Speaker 1:          09:03          Right. And or sorry, on the, on the previous, on the start deal prior to the 2011 deal and calling them out and saying, look, you're cheating on this and you, you know, you gotta be held accountable. I mean, there's certain things there that, that makes sense then that don't add up. If you talk to somebody who says, well, he's an absolute puppet, and you say, well, okay, he's a puppet, so why? Or is he doing certain things that seemed counter to Russian interests? And they'll say, well, because he's smart and he's like, he doesn't want to get caught out. I didn't see it. He's playing, he's playing a long game here, you know, and he's, and, and, and I'm thinking, okay, I, you know, maybe, maybe, who knows? But, uh, I haven't, I haven't strapped on my tin foil hat yet to get to that point. So I dunno. I Dunno. Yeah, that seems like a complicated one. If they have some compromising information about them, that was always the fear, right. Is that they knew something or, yeah, maybe it was business dealings. Maybe it was people peeing on him or, yeah. So I'll get them if they had, if they did not. And again, anything I can help now in today's world, anything's possible. Right, right. And I wish we had somebody else in there who was more elegant and eloquent and sophisticated as anybody stand out. Uh, not right now. No.
