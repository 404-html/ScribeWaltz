Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches schedule on Saturday and Sunday. Do you allow yourself some leisure? I'll sleep as long as I want. And I listened to different records during the week. I listened, I do protein listening, which is records I haven't heard yet. And so just, you know, you have to really concentrate on the weekend. I do carbohydrate listening, whereas records that I'm familiar with that I just like to listen to. How so? Just like a sort of a light thing. Well, just like songs, albums I've had for 25 years that I still like to listen to. And that's like, you know, Chile and soup and bread and potatoes and then during the week it's Shashimi and clap pushups. You know what a strange life you have, man. Yeah, yeah. It's very original. I'll tell you that. It's different. Yeah. If you're, you know, be weird. Live. Where'd you know?

Speaker 1:          00:48          Weird is this weird does, I guess? Well, you get involved in relationships and you getting a girlfriend or something like that and they realize they're getting involved with, they're like, oh Jesus Christ, who is more what I'm getting involved with. And I realize I can't hack it because here's the awful thing about being an adult in a relationship, just seeking to be an adult in a relationship. I have found when I was young and I was a boy and I was dating girls, it's boys and girls and she's an idiot. You're an idiot. You do dumb things and when cheats and whatever, then you hit a certain part of your life where she's a woman and you're a man and you have adult expectations and you can't be running around being an idiot with someone who kind of wants you to be at the table because they are sincerely giving time of their adult life to this thing that you were doing together and when you come in still thinking you're in ninth grade and she's coming in like this is part of what my life is, is being with you.

Speaker 1:          01:47          I have never been able to answer that in a mature enough way to where I would have been able to maintain it because like say next weekend if I had a girlfriend, she might say, it's Friday. What are we doing? I'm like, oh, watching me write for four hours. And so that's not the way to be. You can't do that. And so I can't be a good persons other half because I'm always, the work has always attracted me more than coming home to someone. Wow. Like, I can't stand the idea of someone of living with a person. I can do it on the bus cause it's das boat. And we're like, you know, going down the road. Um, but I, I never would want to like wake up and she's there and I have no aversion to, they look to your right. She said, well, it's every day here we are together, just not wired that way.

Speaker 1:          02:49          I would be a drag. Like, you haven't spoken to me in 20 hours. Huh? I didn't notice. And I'm just a work oriented. And so, and I, I'm not interested in wasting anyone's time. I'm not interested in being mean. I'm really not into it. And so I, I'm not, the woman was hitting on meal while ago and I said, ma'am, I'll call her ma'am. That's a problem. She was very persistent. And I, I said, ma'am, um, I'm like a hunting dog. I'm a dog. Just not the kind you pat, you know, I'm just not, I'm just, I'm sorry. Uh, you should stop because she's imagining holding your hand, coming to your spoken word shows, going on, going to dinner with you and talking about your day and you're like in front of your fucking crazy speakers and your writing and yeah. Hoping the phone doesn't ring right.

Speaker 1:          03:45          Uh, I unplug it on the weekends except on Sunday. My best friend, since I was a 11, 12 and he was 11, we're still best friends. He, you ever heard of the band flew Ghazi? Yes. Okay. Well, Ian Mci, the like, he's my best friend and we grew up together doing music and everything and we talk almost every Sunday. And so, uh, we've been best friends since the Carter Administration. Wow. And so Ian will call on Sunday, we'll talk for a while. Otherwise the phone doesn't ring. If it does, I'm like, oh no. Why? Well, I thought you liked me. Why are you calling? And so I, I thought you liked, if you liked me, he wouldn't write me. But meanwhile I'm, I'm contentedly just working away.

Speaker 2:          04:39          Okay. Yeah.
