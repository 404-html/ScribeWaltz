Speaker 1:          00:00          This is the thing I don't think I don't, fighting is very important to me. It means a lot. It means a lot because I used to do it. It means a lot cause I love to watch it. It means a lot because I'm very deeply entrenched in the history and the significance of it, what it means. And for me, fighting should always be done at its best. And what that means is you should always do what's the right thing to do in the situation. Like if you're, uh, you know, you could break it down when individual arts, right? If you're, um, if you're doing Jujitsu, there's a, there's a correct way to do an arm bar counter, right? Don't do the incorrect way because the fans want to see, right. That doesn't make any sense to me. If there's an exciting way to get out of an arm bar, that's not the right way to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:47          But not Dan's like his lamb, but it might, well, the pick 'em up and slam. I'm works if you have to, but I'm saying like just as a rough example, if, if you, if there was a way to defend an arm bar that wasn't the correct way to do it, but the fans liked it more. Don't do that. Don't do that. You want to fight like a maestro, right? You want to fight like, like a virtuoso. You want to fight like mighty mouse. There you go. Exactly. What I tell everybody, you look at my mighty mouse has had moments in his career, like the Ian Mccall fight is a good example where he was, he also had a full time job, wasn't dedicated the way it should be and got into a brawl and Ian took his back. Wanna pounded them and mighty mouse had vertigo. After that fight, he was really fucked up and, and then quit his job.

Speaker 1:          01:30          I realize like I have to go full time. I have to dedicate myself to this full time, you know? And when he did that, then under the tutelage of Matt Hume, he came, he became the mighty mouse we see now. But in my opinion, one of the things that sets him apart from everybody else is that he, he's not running away from you and not getting hit. He's running at you and not getting hit or, I mean, he's coming straight forward and then cutting angles and doing things to you that you didn't anticipate and he's not there for the counters. So he's fighting correctly. Seamless too. Yeah. And it's incredibly exciting. And that was one of the, the, the criticisms of him really early on in his reign was that he wasn't finishing guys and then he knocked out Joseph Benevidez and then he started finishing guys in the final seconds of the round.

Speaker 1:          02:18          Right. You know what I mean? He's, he's just a monster man as man. He says fucking monster. But he fights correctly. I would say don't, no disrespect to Chris Lytle, who I love. He's a great fighter. I was just watching his fight against Brian Foster and he was so skilled that people have got a good, Chris Lidell was won that fight with a leg lock. Hmm. You know, and he's known as a brawler and people forget, he fucking spun around, got that leg and snatch it out and extended and really fuck Brian's leg up crafty veteran. He was a crafty guy, but broad a lot. I'm not a fan of, I'm a fan of watching brawls when they take place. I'm not a fan as well either.
