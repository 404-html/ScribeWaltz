Speaker 1:          00:00          I'm ridiculous. How frustrating was it for you going into that Tony Ferguson fight with that staph infection? Because that was a, that was serious. I didn't notice it at the weigh ins, but then the moment you walked into the cage, it was funny man, because they were telling DC don't talk about it cause I was going that staff that, that is fucking staff. And then they said to DC, don't talk about it. He goes, Yup, that looks like staff to me. He just ignored him. He's like, fuck you. That's staff. I don't know why they didn't want anybody breaking it up because it's an important point. It's an unfortunate thing that happens during training sometimes. Yeah. Eight. Uh, I kinda notice it on a Sunday, you know, in the Tuesday we do the check ins and everything and uh, I had the girl, I'm like, can you, you know, put some makeup on it because I didn't want nobody to find out.

Speaker 1:          00:45          And uh, even Tony Him, if he would have saw it, he would have no, he knew uncompromise all that. Um, but yeah, it frustrated things. They make things a lot more complicated. It put me, it made the weight cut terrible. Uh, just to go back to it. I mean I'm cutting from 76 to to fifties. I had to be 55 for that fight and I try my best to skim it down in about 12 hours. So I woke up at 5:00 AM with at about one 62. Uh, and Wayans are between nine and 11. Um, and from 5:00 AM til 8:00 AM I had only cut one pound compare to in other cuts that have gone really well. I'll normally cut bout four or five pounds in that time. But because I, I just was feeling good and I wasn't worried about it and the s and I was using the same temperature of water, I was using the same everything, but the staff made my body hold onto the water.

Speaker 1:          01:40          So when I went down and checked and saw that it was still like five pounds up with like two hours ago, they started like throwing it, boiling hot water on me to get my botany. Yeah, to give me sweating to get it off. It was brutal. Yeah. That's for, for know. For someone who doesn't, never, never experienced staff. Explain what does to your body, it makes you feel the next day. I just, I felt so tired. I never felt as tired in my life and it felt, I felt so tired to the point where I tried to counteract it by getting myself as pumped as I can. And the, you know, do you normally get there two hours before the fight? When I walked into the arena that night, two hours before I was in a sweat, you know, my body was like full of adrenaline. Like I wasn't taking any medication.

Speaker 1:          02:26          You weren't going on in antibiotics. He figured, did you have to decide whether you should take antibiotics and then, you know, that compromises your endurance for sure. Or just let your body fight it off. I had it before I had been on the antibiotics and they just make terrible, you know, if you've ever been through it. I mean, it's a terrible feeling. So I just was like, you know what? I think I can just push through it. And I'm young and I was like, you know what, fuck it. Like let's just go like, did you try any like a natural remedies oil? You know, it wasn't a whole lot I could take, cause I also got to cut the weight still. Right. You know, uh, some topical stuff that one of the things they say that works really well, topical, believe it or not is mince.

Speaker 1:          03:07          Garlic. Garlic apparently has a tremendous effect on staph infections. I was swallowing whole cloves of ginger. I remember I would take gender, I would chop it up and I'll swallow it, uh, to see if that would do some. But you know, it's, yeah, it's a hard battle cause some real strong antibacterial properties. And one of the people that have been on the podcast, many times, Doctor Rhonda Patrick said she, she had dealt with some persistent staph infection and she had like a whole inner skin. And what she did was she took garlic and packed it into that hole. Jen and fucking killed it. I mean, Geez, I wish I would've known that before. I just kinda just fought through it. I was like, fuck it, I'm just going. Defense soap makes some really good stuff. That too, they make us these essential oils. It's tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil and you put it on like right where they have an issue.

Speaker 1:          03:57          Where were you in in October would have been there for you. Anybody else there that has that staff? Anytime you have any sort of a ringworm or staff or anything, there's some natural stuff. Not like some bullshit homeopathic nonsense, but some actual real natural stuff that can help you. And Defense soap specializes in that because a guy sacco, the guy who owns the company, he is, you know, coaches wrestling and deals with kids. I'd always have ringworm staph infection, so she can, he came out with these soaps. He's natural soaps that are just designed for grapplers. It's why it's called defense soap. No. And then, um, I'll have them send you some and then the essential oils and balms and stuff like ointments for scratches and shit like that. So they don't get infected. That's, you know, Jim's, it's, you're always getting infected. Yeah. And that's it.

Speaker 1:          04:44          That was one of the biggest focuses that this canvas, just like make sure I stay healthy because they, if you don't have your health, you don't have nothing. And that was what it was at that Tony fight and it's just, it, it became something I didn't want to. It was such a big event and it was my first real big event to a that I just wanted it all just to go right and go over. But it ended up being just a lot of my, by the staff originally. I think it came from mental stress, you know, it, it was so many stresses going on, you know, you really sure. Yeah. You and you look at the three biggest stressors, you know, I was going through a divorce and I had just moved into a house. You look at those in a normal day to day life that though those are like the two biggest stressors.

Speaker 1:          05:25          You can have a then to add on fighting for a world title in six weeks. So I'm just like fucking go. Like, I was like, you know, I wouldn't expect them to, I was thinking maybe a, they was gonna give me Tony, but maybe in December indeed and in Detroit or if something like that, but he was like six weeks. I was like, hi, what fog does, right. They were thinking about doing you in Detroit. Right. That was a, that was, that was the talk. And you were requesting a big fight in Detroit. Yeah, that's where all my, like, you know, every year I kind of Chore Plan Out my year and a, and a, and I got my vision in my head. Uh, I got to call them water bowls in there. That was one of them. But yeah, it ended up putting a little bit too much stress on me all at once. And I took on a lot for that one. But you did learn dot. Tell you what, man, when you took him down and mounted him and the first round I was like, Holy Shit, cause I know how good Tony is on the green.
