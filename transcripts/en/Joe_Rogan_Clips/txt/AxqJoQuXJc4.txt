Speaker 1:          00:00          Real concern is that just like we are an evolution of those lower primates, it's going to be an evolution. I think that's going to happen. I don't think I, you know, I, there may not be any avoiding it. You buy debate again, we're the virus, you know, and this is just one of my thoughts is, and me saying unequivocably that but are other virus just yet. The thing is I like people to know. I like these, the other side of it, people are cool Trey, that aliens go ahead and attack this motherfucker. So white people and black people have cut the bullshit and finally have to unite like one great movie, your Red October. I think we're going to get our asses kicked and I'm not saying we're not, but at least at least for one time humanity, all the empires would have to unite.

Speaker 1:          00:38          Like that's what I'm saying. I remember that Reagan's speech. No, you never heard it. Reagan actually said that in a, he was, I forget who he was addressing. Maybe the first person to ax it besides him. Put it in the civil right. That, I mean the King Day you might give me. The only other thing I like about Ronald Reagan was a very strange, he said one of the things that was really strange about it was that it's, it's shut off this gigantic wave of conspiracy theorist who were thinking that they're going to tell us something about alien contact. Check this out, listen to this

Speaker 2:          01:11          outside universal threat. I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this word dude and yes I asked you is not an alien force already among us what could be more alien to the universal aspirations of our peoples than war and the threat of tell you what to Ronald Reagan

Speaker 1:          01:41          knocked it out of the fucking park right there. Straight up. I have a song called Reagan. Many of you know wasn't the biggest fan of him or many of us presidents because I wrapped it up more than him in there, but that definitely is going to make it on a killer Mike Song. Really I talked to you. Got It. You got this killer Mike and LP. We definitely, if anybody think aliens are going to come kill us all one day, so I'm going to maybe suggest to ail, hopefully we'll use it. But if not fucking I'm gonna do it when dat shit is amazing. Yeah. Yeah. What do you, do you think that it is possible that aliens came down and manipulated the genetics of lower primates and creative people? I'm willing big based on all the theology, I'm willing to accept it. That's a possibility because I don't think that we're alone.

Speaker 1:          02:24          I just don't. I there's nothing, even if there is some divine thing that woke up and decided to make us and we were special children and we are on earth, the who plan, there had to have been some other things made her play with. Right. I don't think that I think is very arrogant as a human being to think that it's just us. Right. And I think that the possibility that something made it here and something happened exist. Absolutely. Cause if we're experimenting on animals and things, we got like where my daughters army, their temperament is mean. They're curiosity is me. Like I see. I'm looking at Michael and I'm looking at an eye and I'm like arguing with tonight. It's like arguing with myself. She doesn't know why she acts like that. I don't know. Now if I can look at my pit bull and say, well, her mother asked it like this and this is why I know she's coded this way.

Speaker 1:          03:16          I know her father was his. Then I have to look at my daughter and save on a genetic basis, 23 of my chromosomes. I know our temperament is like that. I know why Michael is not going to argue she's a smart kid. She's a art student. But the minute you put her in danger, she's going to punch you. You know what I mean? That's what, that's what is going to be. And it's not going to be anything else because she is going to protect her and her. So it's like, I have to think that my curiosity, if nothing else, my drive to do this. So if you take the primate side, you say, well, you know you, you know that I have to live in Marxist. I gotta survive as wolves. Is Lions, tigers bears out here. I have to go high, I have to create shell.

Speaker 1:          03:50          There's something else which was a very small input could have dropped here, landed here and what's crazy, if you look into nation of Islam philosophy of sorts, they have a Ufo type philosophy. Something here in and buy their mind is scientists created, you know, all of the win, win, win a Shrek. Rain kind of created a different races. But something could have come here and it and it gets here and it says boom, if I do this and this and I create this and then we set upon evolution and we ended up here or that's just could be, you know me stone having watched too many side five movies. But it's possible. It is. It's, it is possible. There's zero evidence for it, but it's certainly possible that if we could go to another planet that we knew how in life that it's possible if we found some lower primates that we would manipulate them.

Speaker 1:          04:34          It's very possible for a full survey of another planet we got there and like, okay, here's the good news. Good News. A lot of life. Bad News is the most intelligent thing is basically a chimp. But we've got some ideas and uh, we're gonna do is we're going to plant some seeds of our genetics in some of these champs. They're going to be smarter than the other chimps and then we're going to believe mushrooms everywhere. A lot of that leave the mushrooms everywhere. Let the chimps eat. Maybe we're in a fishbowl maybe. Yeah. Cause again, we're at, we very arrogantly think of ourselves is as top choice, but maybe, maybe we're just a virus on this living thing. Maybe something maybe you know, we say anything but you make about we could go estate a virus, a amass virus could kill us all. Yup. The sure that's what we're constantly fighting.

Speaker 1:          05:16          The Earth wouldn't stop. But the thing about viruses like get viruses wholly negative in our eyes, I don't think we're wholly negative to each other. I don't think a virus thinks his holiness. What I'm saying is that eating you up, you're having a good party. When you get the flu, they're like, dude, it's probably up if this thing is really a living thing. If the nerve is really living thing, we are possibly the worst thing. Sore it. Oh, for sure. Why shouldn't it get rid of us other than meteors? Yeah. Yeah. We're the worst thing for not just the biological life, but the particulates in the atmosphere, and now we're creating technology that's going to eventually kill us and get rid of us that may be able to live in harmony with biology maybe. So. Yeah, maybe. Maybe it's over for us in a few thousand years.
