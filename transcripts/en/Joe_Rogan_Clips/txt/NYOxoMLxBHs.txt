Speaker 1:          00:00          Or three, two spillover. How are you felling what's going on? See Ya. Good to see you too. Thank you very much for taking me up on that flight. I'm gonna tell you what, no, legitimately you changed the way I think about La. It's really small, isn't it? It's way smaller than you think. It's a different thing when you fly over it. You Go, oh, just ain't that big. Yeah, that's here. This is what it is. I remember when I was still getting my license and I was doing a night flight, right. Mom, which is insane. Totally different ballgame. Well imagine and uh, yeah, cause when you're on the ground you're like, wow, it'd be really easy to see everybody because you're looking up and all you've seen as the backdrop of the dark sky. Right? Right. But when you get up there, if someone's below you, they disappear into the city.

Speaker 1:          00:45          So that's what, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So anyways, so we were flying back and I trained down in Long Beach, so we were going along the seven 10 and I just see like all these, these lights and it was like right down like going up and I go, what's that? He goes and I've got a pilot with Toby goes, oh that's the uh, that's the fireworks from Disneyland. And I was like, fucking Disneyland is right there because in my head it took like two hours to get there. Hour and a half going down the five. But it's just like, cause you don't look at miles. All you do is look at time when you were out here because there's so much traffic. But it's literally like, oh that's like 40 miles. It's not even, it's like from Hollywood, like I would take it, it can't even be more than 1520 miles away.

Speaker 1:          01:27          Like Anaheim is so fucking close. But I just, it's just, or like Irvine Comedy Club, that's all I think of. It's just fucking way to fuck down there. And then you get up in a helicopter and you're like there and like 11 minutes going like, this is, this is ridiculous. So, um, yeah, yeah. That's awesome dude. It was awesome. Yeah, it was a Malibu when you landed on a top of that little hill there with the picnic table. Dude, that's funny. I sat it down Nice. That was a little nervous. So I'm like, all right, don't fuck this up with Joe here. Cause he's going to be like, Eh, forget. Know. It's all right when he was flying, when he went, when the big part, when he went to land, he wasn't that good. But I'm smooth. And then the apocalypse now. Shit, we're going through the canyons.

Speaker 1:          02:07          Dot. I thought that was awesome, man. That was there. Um, I get it. There was a fun. That's, it's a a, it's a lot of fun in the, you know, I fly mostly with an instructor because they got the kid and everything, but every once in a while you got to go up by yourself, just so you know you can do it. But, um, I also, um, I'm actually over to Overdo to do it, but I always go out and I do like the auto rotations and he'll just sorta chuck, I'm flying along. He'll just chop throttle and like it, it's just, it's just rolling the Rpms. I mean, rolling in the engine now, not the Rpm, the engine down. And then you immediately have to pick a spot, you know, when sometimes you know, the lower you are, you know, it becomes literally what you, the first place you look is where you're putting it.

Speaker 1:          02:44          It's really crazy. But, um, where you would, where you would put what you're talking about. You mean crash landing, that's an autorotation means it'd be basically if you had some sort of problem. Yeah, engine failure, whatever. So like when you're flying along in the engine's working, it's drawing into the disc and that's what creates lift. But when, uh, when you go into an auto rotation, um, it's, it's the air rushing. You're using gravity, bringing the, uh, the helicopter down, using that air, like almost like a fan to keep it going. So, and there's a critical point where if you let the main rotor go too slow, that's why the low rpm horn comes on, which is just a nausea and sound. Uh, if you let it go too low, that when it gets to a point where if it's spinning too slowly, no matter how fast you drop, you can't get it going again, fast enough to create.

Speaker 1:          03:33          And you're basically at that point, you're in something that's in the longer able to fly your, uh, your instructors, Skylar, Skylar pointed out something that I didn't know that they have to Redo those things. Like every x amount of miles, they rebuild every hours. Yeah. Yeah. It's a, well, they have like, there's all this maintenance along the way. They're incredibly maintained because I'm sure you noticed if you read the comments, all people talk about is dying in aviation. It's like, ah, that's how entertainers die. It's like, no, it isn't. They overdose. If you really looked at the graph there on the ground, completely safe overdose car accidents, there's always over those ranking. Yeah. And Shit like that. And it's just like, that's mainly how you die. Like the amount of people that are up there every day and then nothing happens. It's, it's, you know, but there is the, you know, the, the fly in the ointment is that there's, there are, uh, particularly at the private level, there are knuckleheads out there like this.

Speaker 1:          04:30          People like I think every time I get in I'm always thinking like, am I going to, you know, I don't want to die today. So I, I go over all a whole bunch of shit. And you know, especially at my want to fly solo, I have the whole flight, I have all my options on, you know, where I could land, you know, if I had a problem, like that's what you're supposed to do. I look at weather reports, I do all of that shit. And what happens is guys get more and more confident and their preflight is, they kind of look, oh, it looks pretty clear. And then they go out there and, uh, you know this, you know this, there's, there's people who go up knowing that they can die. And then there's other people out there who just like magnum Pi and they want to fly by waterfalls and shit.

Speaker 1:          05:12          I mean, those guys have more fun. But, uh, it's, you know, there's definitely, um, those are the people that, you know, you supposed to fly, there's like two envelopes. She supposed to fly within the envelope of what you're flying and then you know, your skillset so you don't fly in to shit. This is like, you know, like if the, if it's too windy or whatever, I'm just, I'm just, I'm not going, even if I could handle it, it's like I'm not going to have fun up there fucking, you know, riding it out and just, you know, let the wind do what it wants to do and don't fight it and, you know, make sure, you know, you're not flying to fail. You do is slow down, you know. Um, but you know, it's, it's there, there are elements of that, but like if you look up there versus what's going on down below, when you fly, I always say this, when you drive on the highway, like you're flying in formation, you're in the blue angels with, with nobody talking to anybody.

Speaker 1:          06:01          You have no idea what anybody's going to do. People are texting, they're on medication. They fucking hung over their suicide. What the fuck they're doing. You know, and then the end, the top of that, you've got to look up for the guy splitting lanes in the motorcycles and shit. Um, it's pretty amazing how few accidents are actually, are they? It is, it is. And what I fly, the Robinson's, they get a bad rap saying they're not safe because they look at the amount of crashes that they've had, but it's be, it's because it's a helicopter you can afford. So it's inherently a low hour pilot. And if you look at it, it's, most of the time it's not, it's not the helicopter, it's the, it's the person flying it. Um, which is why you really have to be on it. Like you, you, you can't. Um, it's, it's just not something, uh, uh, uh, I don't know how to explain it.

Speaker 1:          06:48          It's this weird thing where your, your level of enjoyment is way higher if you're, if you're riding in it, you know what I mean? If you're the person flying the whole time, you have your life and other people's lives at hand so that you're not really, oh look at that. Oh look at that. Oh look at that yet. Got Most so like, you know, thinking things of like, you know, when we were flying through that canyon, you need that at that. I think in that shit, I'm looking, you know, no one where the wires are and where the road is cause that's all fucking tree. So it's going to be the road. So there's those, you know, when you're kind of going around a bend, you know, this certain like altitudes and stuff just, it's, it's boring, but it's just stuff that you're, you're always thinking that, um, you know, I imagine like when you fight, does that, you know, I know with a lot of, it's like instinct and stuff with this, these things that you just don't do.

Speaker 1:          07:34          You know what I mean? I don't know anything about fighting, but it was heard in boxing. You don't lead with an opera cut. That's just, it's just fucking things. You don't think you see a lot of guys like when they go to take off, they do this fucking thing. Like the nose down attitude. Like I was taught not to do that. Cause I know they do that because it looks cool. I don't know why they do it. I mean you're supposed to, like, I was taught, you're supposed to keep it level so that way if you have a problem, you know, you, you're already in the right attitude to just immediately enter, enter an auto. Like, now, if I'm, if I'm fucking nose down and if I'm too far to the ground, I'm just gonna fucking go right into the ground. Um, I dunno, but I mean I'm, I'm still like totally a novice.

Speaker 1:          08:09          I'm, I'm coming up on 200 hours, so I don't know a lot, but I'm super, super, super, super fucking cautious and, uh, I make sure I don't go too long without doing an auto rotations. I used to hate them and now I actually really liked them. Um, it was sorta the way it was explained to me, I didn't get it until one day. I just thought about it and then I got it and I was able to lock into it. Cause it's, it's the same inputs if you were going in for a landing, but they broke it down to like four steps. Like it was low Rpm, you know, lower collective, gentle aft cyclic, you know, uh, look at you trim strings. You know, [inaudible] was a trim, trim, airspeed, Rpms and just fucking doing all of this. And the reality is, it's just like, it's the right pedal.

Speaker 1:          08:53          Jesus Christ that forgot that pedal. So it's all the same. It's all the same input if you were going in for a landing. So all I do, anytime I hear the low rpm is I just do that and then I'm locked into it and then I'm just watching Martin and I can just watch my rpms. And at this point I've flown enough where I kind of know where I'm interim, which basically means you're not like crabbing and you kind of go in straight and then you can kind of like pick out your spot and then it becomes fun as what's cool is you can do like one 80 autos. You can turn around. And what I do like about it is when you come down to the ground as you can bleed off all of your airspeed, that forward motion that's going to fucking kill you.

Speaker 1:          09:27          And as long as you don't fuck up and flare and go back up and then drop like a, you know, you know, it's kind of like a hockey stop was the way it was described to me. Just level it out and running should go to drop. You pull like that and these guys land, I'm like daisies and stuff. It's, it's really amazing. I'm not as good as that, but like I, I will do it where, you know, worst case scenario, you know, I might well like I fuck like get a little bit of a bump. Yeah. But I'm going to be all right. So, um, yeah I don't know. Now there's probably a bunch of people saying, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, which admittedly, you know, I still think there's a lot of shit I need to learn about standup. So as long as you go into things like that, um, you know, well the fact that you're doing it in the fact that you learn in a new thing that's really difficult to learn.

Speaker 1:          10:09          Don't you think that that's good for your brain? Now I am a big believer in constantly learning. It's why I like you as a person cause you're constantly like, you're not the Joe I knew three years ago in a good way. You're like, you, you learn all of this. You know, when I first met you, you weren't hunting. Uh, you weren't a marsh. That was thing you would, you a two dimensional, you will, which was amazing because everyone was just a comedian. He will this taekwondo champion, a standup guy. And then, and then since then, you've added all, like the guests that you have on in the fact that you're able to like talk to them and stuff is because you've continued to, you know, um, you know, it's, it's the same thing with like a comic who writes his first hour and then just sits on it for like eight years and all of a sudden two presidents goes by. It's like, why aren't they laughing anymore? It's like, cause you're just stuck in time. So, um, I, I.
