Speaker 1:          00:00          Speaking of delicious. Are you hunting at all? Yes. Yes. Yes. What's your hunt? Well, I mean I'm going through the two elk that I've given away a lot of it too and got shot last year. Every year I scheduled to elk hunts and uh, assume I'm going to strike out. And uh, the last two years I've been very lucky and I got to elk each year. So it's breaking the rules of the secret in think and grow rich, you know, to assume you're going to strike out. I supposed to sit cross legged in your son and manifest that shows. Yeah, I work hard, but I assume it's a hard thing to do to fucking it is and people don't realize they don't. And he'll, he'll look at a clip like there's clips of me online and the clip is like a minute long and it seems like, oh look, look how easy you don't see stalking in for hours.

Speaker 1:          00:46          You don't see the hundreds of hours of shooting arrows. The coaching from John Dudley, all the reading, archery articles and understanding what, keeping your mindset clear in the moment. It's a lot of difficult to long haul. My boys have their first hunt in three months when we'll kind of, we've been prepping for seven months. They're doing bow hunt and Kona real pig. Oh yeah. My, my wife, she's going to have to sheep. How old boy is it going to have to pay the 10. So you're getting them a crossbow? No, no, they're right now they're shooting at Hoyt ignite. Um, they're shooting at about 25 yards. Justice shooting at about 40 yards and how much they've been prepping. They're about 45 now, which is going to be enough. That's enough. But I mean there's still contact Brian. I mean there's still, when they, when they draw their, you know, pointing up and pull in, so they've still got a couple more months of training to, to really get dialed in.

Speaker 1:          01:38          Um, but yeah, it's, it's difficult. I still haven't even gotten my elk bow hunting. You know, I spent my last time, I spent six days up in the Colorado mountain range in the, uh, the um, what they called the Santa De Cristo Range, you know, and, and on the last day I finally came in on elk and it was dark and I shot and I missed. And that was after seven fricking days of trying and you walk out or how far was a shot your horse out? Completely empty handed. It's about 45 yards in dusk. But you know, I mean, you know how it goes. You're shaking. It's so dark and yeah. Um, anyways though, so I'm going to do a, I'm going to do Kona. Actually I'll get you in touch with Dudley cause I know been touching him, we've talked before, I know how you shoot, you shoot with a finger trigger that shooter.

Speaker 1:          02:28          Yeah, I need to, it's, it's on my list. But as those moments like that when you, you're hunting for six days and you just trekking through the woods 20 miles a day and you're exhausted and you finally get that one moment. There's so much weight on that moment that it's so difficult to stay focused entirely on the task of executing the shot perfectly. And there's methods. There's a guy named Joel Turner who has, um, I don't know, he's got a website called iron mine hunting. He's a, uh, he's a, he's an instructor for um, uh, first responders and snipers and things along those lines and iron mind iron mine where she lived, I think he's a Pacific northwest guy and he's helped me tremendously. His, his methods. It's all about keeping a, uh, the difference between an open loop system in a closed loop system. Be Able to control it and stop it and stop the process anytime you want and keeping yourself in that versus like a baseball bat swing, which is once you start swinging, just swinging.

Speaker 1:          03:31          And the idea is to, to maintain the present NT, to have a mantra and he gives you a mantra to chant and to think about it in terms of controlling all of those movements. So you are in control constantly. Well you, you develop your own, but the idea is to talk yourself through it. Don't let your excitable mind take over Oge it's coupled with the dope. Did you freak out and you pull the trigger and you shoot fucking over the things back and you don't even know what happened. What's your mantra? Lost? Um, I, I pull back and I say draw. I go through all the steps in my head that I'm supposed to do. I actually modified his and went to John Dudley's. So his, he has his own one, which is a drawback and aim. Get it done, watch it to keep it. And the whole idea is just keeping those things in your head.

Speaker 1:          04:24          So you have one thing, but what would Dudley, I go through all the different things that he says, like a drawback. Tip of the nose center, the peep center, the bubble pulled through the shot, pull, pull, pull, let the shop break. And so I go through all those things in my mind, but the, the whole idea is did not allow the freak out. Cause the freakout is what causes the target panic. And when you have that itchy trigger finger with the finger trigger, you look good. And that's, that's, I've done it. I mean, I've seen it. I've done it. I've seen it, I've heard it. Everybody does it. The, the Arrow goes in the spot, you know where you're yanking it and you're pulling it. He's not very precise and you want to get it to where it's a surprise shot. And when it's a surprise shot, you're just concentrating entirely on the area that you want to hit on the ALC.

Speaker 1:          05:11          Your form is perfect, everything's aligned in order and if it's not, you let down. If it's not, you let down and try to get your shit together. Yeah, she was trained to hunt competitions. Helped me out quite a bit, I'm sure. But those are like, it's like a three day shoot, but they put shooting around and getting exhausted. No, no, not really. Like they're, uh, they do have part of it as like that, like an obstacle course race with your bowl. But then part of it too is just a three day shoot. But like, uh, like a a 40 target three day shoot where one shot might be I'm facing you but the targets behind me and you've got a ten second time spend a draw, turn and shoot or you got to take a shot seeded through the trees at 40 yards and then within 20 seconds do a shot at 60 yards.

Speaker 1:          05:56          So a lot of hunting scenario, we would tell you that that is going to cause target panic. Did that whole thing of shoot now that you should never just do that, that you should always execute the shot correctly. Even he doesn't even like this fucking game, this thing, this a techno hunt that we, we've done, he doesn't like that. He thinks that that thing causes target panic because you only have a brief window and you're like go, it's like you, he believes that you should concentrate entirely on the correct fundamentals and execution of archery and then with time and understanding of the situation, the experience of hunting itself, then when those moments present themselves, you're going to execute correctly. Whereas when you have this like ten second you've got to turn and behind your back ready go. He like Blah. You're just, you're just going to hit that. You're going to hammer that trigger. You going to put that pin on the target and hammer that trigger, and that's just, you are emphasizing all the wrong things that you could do when you're hunting. Yeah.
