Speaker 1:          00:00          Larger people. They're eating better. You know what I wanted to ask you please. Conspiracy theories. I know you have some. Yeah, I got something. I felt like I was listening to you about what is something about Martians the other day that was a proud Papa Johns Jones is Alex. Alex, amazing NASA shirt. I was gonna buy for Eddie the other day. Yeah, Alex wore a NASA. Yeah. Yeah. Hey Eddie, believe she had that even Alex thinks is ridiculous. Like what quits conspiracy theories do you want to know about it? No, I'm like, let me hear some, well, I believe less than, less than I ever used to. Population control. Do you believe that? No, I don't believe that. I don't believe there's any concerted effort. Um, it like where there's a bunch of really rich people that have decided to euthanize a bunch of people to keep the population low.

Speaker 1:          00:46          I think that is, that's paranoid. I think that there's probably some people that go, you know what? We would be a lot healthier if there was less people, but there's no, there's no obvious effort. The population keeps fucking growing. Imagine if you are the all powerful, all knowing people that were running the world and you're doing such a shitty job of population control. Yeah. I don't know how you're going to control the India and China. You're not, you're not. You're not. You're not getting in these fucking dirty villages and trying to stop being not doing it anywhere. And even in this country, people are fucking like wild animals and just come in next month, you guys got three kids. Yeah. Like, look, it's just the way it is. Mad People like to fuck. They like to make people in China. You're only allowed one kid. No, I think they lived that.

Speaker 1:          01:27          They've left lifted, lifted that because a lot of people were drowning their daughters. There were, there was horrible shit. Wow. You're killing, I mean, this is the rumor was that people were, they wanted a son and if they had a daughter they would, you know. Yeah. The daughter was like the law, the law. The lose for you. Yeah. And to me a daughter is a win because there's so much easier to deal with. Really. I find with my daughter, I'm, we're, we're like this. Yeah. You know what, man? I mean, just be of a boy coming next. You got to have the ying and the Yang. Little Joseph Lennox Lewis. Peter's coming next month. Hey, I'm Joseph Lennox Rogan Peters. He's going to be amazing. I'm so happy that you gave him my name. Yeah, that's beautiful. Cave at first is going to give me your middle name, but I didn't want to do that to him.

Speaker 1:          02:10          So what's your middle name? Whoa. Yes. My middle name is Claudius. Claudius. Yeah. That sounds like a Roman emperor. Absolutely beautiful. Hey Man, I know you're supposed to get out of here at two o'clock. Do you have a hard out? No, no. You can say. Yeah, absolutely. Beautiful. Let's keep talking. Yeah. Um, yeah. So back to your question. I don't, yeah, I think there's definitely some people that are influencing the way the world works for sure. But I don't think there's anybody that's really trying to control population or this one. Okay. Do you think the Russians put Donald Trump in the president's chair? I think the Russians absolutely wanted Donald Trump to win. Absolutely. And I think they definitely undermined our democracy through various methods of manipulating people through social media. In fact, I have a woman coming on very soon. When is Rene de Resto this week? Next week. She's on next week.

Speaker 1:          03:04          And uh, she actually studied it and wrote, wrote this very comprehensive report about, it was on Sam Harris' podcast and detailed millions of interactions with Russian bots and Russian fake accounts and that these troll farms that we'd create memes and they did, they did a bunch of different things. They didn't just try to pump Trump up, but they also tried to get people against each other and cause all sorts of civil, uh, arguments and all sorts of, uh, on rust. Yeah. All sorts of unrest online. They organize these meetings like they organize one pro Texas meeting across the street from a pro Muslim meeting. I did it on prime, that did it all through Facebook to get these people to fight with each other. They're doing these things to try to get people to take sides and to get people to be angry at the other side.

Speaker 1:          03:55          They did a lot of shit like that. Real sneaky, sneaky stuff that we probably do in foreign countries all the time. And you know, we're mad that they're doing it to us because now they're doing it through social. Yeah. Well if you think about when we were growing up in the eighties seventies and eighties all the imagery we saw, the USSR was very dark and gray and it was very barren and it was destitute and well, some of it was true though. Yeah. But we saw and then all of a sudden that lifts and these hot fucking Russian chicks show up. What were these bitches is the whole time.

Speaker 1:          04:26          That's so true. You never saw the hot Russian league. There's some of the hottest women on a plan. They used to show us these big manly women will do well. And now you're like, well, hello. Hi. Yeah. Yeah. I have two friends in America, Russian ladies. They're very happy. No, the question cause because you're American, everything. I'm not American. So is this wall, if we're going to get built towards that, what's the situation? I don't, I think it was more of a campaign rhetoric thing. You know, build that wall, build that wall. He's kind of staying with it. I mean, I think he wants to porters, I think he's got a kind of do something right. Once you say that, you're gonna build a wall, you got to kind of do something, but they ain't shit been built and we're two years into the president. They haven't built shit. I was a year left in the year and a half left in the presbytery is some wall, there's some wall. It's up. But there's all some big ass gaps. And the, the idea that they're going to stop drugs from coming over from that wall right now, the wall looks like Leon Spinks his mouth. I don't have a bench. I forgot about Leon spanx.
