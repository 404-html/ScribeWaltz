Speaker 1:          00:01          So this movie is based in, uh, in no small part on your own life experiences. It is a adopting and actual you adopted like a full family, three him and children. Wow. Wild. That's a, that's a bold maneuver, sir. Yeah. What were the ages? A six, three and a year and a half. And Wow. Yeah. What was the process? Um, well it starts, and this is how it starts in the movie as well. My wife and I for years, I didn't, I wasn't making any money and including when after I made sex drive and, um, I, uh, so I didn't really feel like I could afford to have kids. So whenever we talk about it, I just be like, you know, not there yet. And, uh, and then finally, um, when I felt like I was doing better, I was starting to get a career together, I just started to feel like I was going to be one of those old dads, you know, like by the time the kid was a teenager, I wasn't going to be able to play with them during old, you know, I'm 49 now.

Speaker 1:          00:57          I was 41 at the time. And, uh, so God, is that right? Oh Man. It's depressing. Anyway, uh, so I, I, uh, I made this dumb joke to my wife. I said, look, why don't we just adopt a five year old? It'll be like, I got started five years ago and I'm like, I'm right back in the game. And she was like, you know, that's actually a really interesting idea. And I was like, no, I'm totally kidding. Didn't mean anything by that. And, and then she went to a website and she showed me the website and then when I saw the website, I was like, oh wow. You see these kids, you see their faces, you start to learn a little bit more about it. And we just started having conversations and it, it went from there. Now, now I got three kids in a movie.

Speaker 1:          01:36          And they're all siblings. Yes. So they're all came from one mom. And what is, how do they get separated from the family? Um, I don't have a lot of details about that. You know, they don't really tell you, you know, you, you know a little bit, but not much. I mean, I know that there was, that there were issues with drugs and I, and I think there was some kind of a fire at some point, but it's all pretty, pretty sketchy as far as what you hear. So you've learned a lot about the kids themselves, but not that much about the situation. And what, what made you want to turn this into a film? Like I would imagine that's a very personal experience. Yeah. Um, it was actually my writing partner, John Morris, because I had been about three years into it at that point and the beginning of it was a nightmare.

Speaker 1:          02:24          Like, like epic, bad decision. Why did we ever do this? Yeah, it was, it was really a nightmare for a short time. And then when it came online and we became a family, it really became the best thing that ever happened to me. And you know, when John and I get together every day, we just talk about our lives a little bit. That's how we get started. So John had been hearing all these stories and one day he just said, I don't know why we're not doing a movie about this because nobody really knows how this works when you go into foster care to adopt kids. So we started talking about it and then there was the conversation of whether it could be a comedy or not because that's what we do. We make comedies. John again was like, most of the stuff you've told me is really funny.

Speaker 1:          03:03          So not all of it of course, but that's, and then we thought, wow, you know, we could approach this as a comedy and we might be able to get, you know, a more general audience to get their, their interest in it that way because it'll feel less scary because that's the problem is that most movies that are made on this topic just frightened people and they make people think that these kids are all, are all damaged and reachable of thing. You know? Do you worry that it would be locked that movie 101 Dalmatians at a bunch of people start getting foster kids now and just screw him up? Yeah, we, well we were talking about top gun about how, you know, remember when top gun came out and everybody joined the navy thinking they were going to fly the plane. Right. Well, when, um, the color of money came out, pool halls boomed across the country.

Speaker 1:          03:46          I made a giant impact on pool halls and I won Tom cruise movie and it was just really, a lot of people just got scammed out of their fucking pocket money. Some of that going on. I think the crazy thing about this too was that like on the set, you realize like when you, when we're doing this, you go like, Oh yeah, I always thought of people who do that. Like, you know, they exist, but you're like, those are nameless, faceless angels. They're not real people. If you're like, do you have any of your friends at top? I'd be like, why don't I have friends like that? Like those are other people you know. And then you start like on the set there was, you know, people visiting or consulting and there would be like, oh, you know, they adopted are they run some foster care thing and then you're like, oh, this is actually something that people really do well.

Speaker 1:          04:31          Even like dudes, the crew that somebody would come up, you know, who's in the electrical department and be like, oh hey bro, I got, I adopted two kids by the way, if you like really, you know, or hey, I got adopted when I was four years old. Did you just would like, once you see it now, everywhere people are hitting me up. Someone hit me up yesterday. Like, my sister is adopting four siblings this week. Wow. Yeah, it's nuts. I mean like, it's like something, and I don't want to, it's almost like when your friend gets a car and then you start seeing it everywhere.

Speaker 1:          05:02          Exactly like that though. Um, we talked about that video that went around online of this little girl that realize that she's opening up a box and there's something in it that tells her that she's been adopted by these two people that are with her. And it's really, yeah, it's impossible to not cry. Yeah. I mean if you have any hard at all and you watch that little girl freak out and it's, it breaks you up. I think that's almost the test as far as what you were talking about, about how, cause believe me, I test if you're a piece of shit or not. When you watch that.

Speaker 1:          05:35          Yeah, we should show that to a lot. What's your reaction? Oh, you're a piece of shit. You're a sociopath. Yeah. But no, I mean there, is that what you were just getting at as far as, believe me, I'm not that. Hi. That like I didn't feel special or like any one of those sort of heart of gold angels. You know, we have a line that's in the movie where mark just says that's for the, the kind of people that volunteer. It's not even a holiday and we don't do that. Yeah. You should probably tell the audience that I'm not staring in this movie right now for people that aren't, you know, those people are like, so Tom starts in snow. It's Mark Wahlberg movie for like four and a half minutes. There you go. And then everyone is mark Walberg Stars in the rest of it. That's true.

Speaker 1:          06:13          That's a good way of breaking it down. It was only probably like 90 minutes, so that's pretty good. That's not bad. What I have probably like seven scenes. That's good scenes that now you've got a solid presence. He didn't make it up. You don't make the poster. The poster, the poster. You made the standee though. Did you know that there's a standee in movie theaters and you're in that. Oh really? All right. I'll take that. Can Steal one. Heard that word? Standee standees. Those are the big cardboard. It was never cost. Those things were because I didn't know that either. Cardboard cutout thing. That's what I always call it cardboard cutout. Standee is the real, the real terms that determine the industry. That's an industry term. That's a real.
