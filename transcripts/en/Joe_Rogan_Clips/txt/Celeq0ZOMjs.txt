Speaker 1:          00:13          You just see eyes widen and they're like, yeah, you're like, dude, we're not at a seminar right now. That's what's bullshit about seminars. I mean came back and if you were in the world of business, see, I really think this is one of the reasons why so many people are so fucked up and so depressed. I think the world of showing to showing up to a place and then having your behavior limited into this very narrow and rigid parameters all day long and your livelihood and your success of your, your family and whether or not you can send your kids to a good school. All that dependent upon whether or not you're willing to play the rules, you have to wear an outfit with a suit and tie because if you don't, you might be unpredictable and you show up with that t shirt on.

No one has a problem with that, which is way more of a hard drug. Way more of a crazy drug. Then a little puff of a joint. We were drinking whiskey. No one cared. We drank whiskey for three hours. No one cared. Smoked a little joint. Oh, you think he inhaled it? Didn't look like it. Then look away and just took like a ninth grader. He didn't know what to do. He took a little puff, you know?

It's no different than having that class with whiskey. You know, California said he could fly with it. Now what? Lex said, you could have an ounce of weed with you on an airplane. They said, we don't know what the fuck's going to happen when you land somewhere where you can go through lax with an ounce of weed. I'm sorry.
