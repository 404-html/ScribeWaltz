Yeah, and there are, there are advertising it on paramount hold serious. Desperate is paramount. Well they might be paid. They got whose money? So yeah. Do you ever drive by Scientology building? I drove by last night. Oh, I got the test and I want it in there. I got the test. I went to one of those things that you did. I held the cans. Yeah, I was a film and a TV show for CBS and we were outside in San Diego and a while we had some downtime. They had this thing set up like a stress test and you go and you hold onto these cans. They asked you questions I think I want to say Brian did stand up in there. So we go up there and do, I either did standup or like a Ted talk or some shit in Scientology building.

Well, he was taking, he was taking acting lessons with a guy who was a rabid scientologist and then I went to see Brian's acting teachers sing songs from musicals, not even a musical, just the songs from the musical like, oh, it was amazing. It was great. Me and Brian were high as Jesus on the space shuttle. I mean we were gone. We were hugging each other. Why it was going on. We couldn't believe how ridiculous it was. Like, oh, he either did like a motivational talk or stand up there though. Well, he was, you know, which is a thing about acting classes. A lot of my ex girlfriend, one of her acting classes when I first moved to La and I started dating, this chick was an actress. Her acting class was assigned tology based act in class and apparently it's really common.
