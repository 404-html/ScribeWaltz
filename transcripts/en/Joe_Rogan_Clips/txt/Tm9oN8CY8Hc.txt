Speaker 1:          00:00          Nice. Let's start reward though. We should have a reward. I got to, I got out of this month. We're going to present you with the belt is we're going to get that done while they're on the stack of weed. I would like to say hope fiction bottom my Instagram for more details. Okay. Okay. Actually let's present the the pulp fit. It's more like creep show werewolf that lives under the stairs. Creep shows they perfect. That is the perfect no goddamn crate. That's the creative creep show. There's more nightmares. I felt so bad. Okay. I would like ladies and gentlemen, we people to present this belt. Thank you very much. Ultimately make you crazy. By the way. The fact that we actually did this was nuts. Nuts and I would like to say on behalf of me, one of the three non winners, I won't say losers of the sober October of fitness challenge.

I was most impressed by you and then if you had been exercising as long as I probably would have died trying to defeat you, great job drug like Thompson. Yes sir. I was not impressed. Come on over the belt. It's already on. I'll just say this. I was a Joe. You showed us definitely what time it was. It was all about second place and you definitely got that. So congratulations to you Ari. But Joe, uh, your in better I, here's a huge shocker. You're in better shape than the three of us. I think that had a factor. There was certainly a part of it. How much energy could put out. We all put in though, man, we all worked our ass off. But it's ultimately it's about TRT. Is that tight enough or not even like an advertisement? Trt. Fuck. At some point we're like, hey, really does go to show you that steroids can help it. Athletic Challenges. This is why it's illegal.
