Speaker 1:          00:01          What about what I house sat for the guy that own Tgi Fridays. He was on a board of directors. Yeah. When I lived on 44 35 far way road and Snowmass village, Colorado, I house sat and the guy, the two years I was there, he came a week and a half. He came for three days and his daughters came for three days. They spent 2000 on booze. They all got drunk and they left two days later and I was talking to the daughter and she's like, yeah, this is, my dad's got houses all over the place. He had three in Colorado alone, like crust. It crested Butte, Snowmass village and he has a house on the other side to ski over there because he liked to different types of bout it.

Speaker 1:          00:49          Jesus Christ. That world when people get that famous, when they get that rich, when they get that the point where they live in some sort of weird Lala land, he had a brand new jeep delivered every year. And part of my agreement was I had a driver like 50 miles a month to keep make sure because when he came to town he didn't want no problems with none of his houses. So we had a different fucking house sitter it every, and if you don't need a background check on, you know, I listened to me, I fucking grandfathered in to the house because my buddy from Jersey had it and his girlfriend came out to visit and he knocked her up. But the guy was difficult to get ahold of because he was in England and whatnot. So my friend just said to me, just just moving. Don't say Dick when he comes in, he'll see it's you and tell him I had to leave and shit, keep my deposit.

Speaker 1:          01:45          So I stayed there for like two months and he came and he's like, who the fuck are you? And I told him what had happened and that we couldn't get ahold of him cause he was in England and he asked me for a couple of names. I would, I had already lived in snow mass for about a year. I left and then came back. So I had a couple of nights references for me, gave me the thing and then left and I was not allowed in this home. So part of the deal was I had an apartment over the garage. I could use this car and it was 18 hours a month to be the shoveling snow or 1818 hours a month of work or so it was essentially a shoveling snow in the winter and the long in the summer he would give me little assignments like paint the wall or whatever I would do, keep the trim up and ship.

Speaker 1:          02:36          It was zero rent. I think he paid me 800 a month and I got to get a day job and ski and Shit like that though I would tape it was a volunteer fireman. You're a volunteer fireman because all right, so cocaine was 1,880 pounds at the time and Snowmass and my buddy said, give it to me for 800 and Jersey. So I would go back and forth and I was making all this on it. The people found that the guy that they blew up, they, they, they put a pipe bomb in this guy's car and they blew him up. His name was Steven Gray Buck. He left a big gap in this fucking drug place. So I was telling him, Oh yeah, they killed this poor bastard in Colorado and Aspen 36 days before he was to stand trial, but they could never get him for cocaine.

Speaker 1:          03:19          He was making 6 million every six weeks. I spoke about this on a once every six weeks. In 1984 they arrested him the first time and 83 they brought him to Denver. They found 9 million altogether cash. Then in [inaudible] 84 was when he went. Every night he'd work out. He was a good looking dude that kept in shape. He had 20 different cars and every night he'd give her the guy at the door, $5 to start the car. The night the guy took the night off, he started his own car, they put a pipe bomb in his car and blew him up. He lived, he made it all the way to the hospital, but something went so deep up his ass, but it just bled to death.

Speaker 1:          04:05          Ooh. So it left this gap. So this guy approached him and then he's like, man, these people are mad at yet. They want to do business with you. You're cutting them out. So I had to talk to them and they said, listen for you to buy. We didn't, we never do a face to face. So they haven't Aspen club and they have a place called the CEO of the Aspen Club is still, you know, in those days these places were a thousand a month to walk in. And I knew a girl that used to go to the Aspen club and she used to tell me that she used to take showers right next to Barbie Benton. I'm a Barbi. Benton Benton had a beautiful Bush. She would tell me every night, Bobby Benton's got a beautiful fucking bushes. Perfect. So there's the Aspen club and the Snowmass clubs. No, mass club has golfing, you know, condos around the thing.

Speaker 1:          04:51          It was like 900 a month to be a member. I couldn't have been a member. So the only way I could become a member with my being a volunteer fireman, then they'd give you admission. And so for 90 days I had a train, you know, go up two flights, this thing on a ladder, carry a rope. But basically it was putting out, when tourists come, they don't know how to fucking turn on the fireplace. So they clean out the sharks and they put them in and then these people would put them in a dumpster. So tentative plan or you're doing this dumpster fires, that's all you're doing. But you got access to the Snowmass club. So basically when we got there was walking to this film mass club, give the girl a $10,000 but on your gym clothes workout, by the time you got back to your locker, the coke was in the locker, it was all and they were all and everybody involved.

Speaker 1:          05:40          Everybody was involved. So the girl that worked, it's that she was getting a piece of weapon we had to do was her hi, how you doing Joe? Yeah. Okay, wow. And then later on I go in the locker at the coke would be that I'd get like a half, eight ounces, you know, I was no dealer and I take it home. But then I started getting coked up every time there was a fire I went through like two fives both dumps is, and this is 16 idiots with a full fire hose. I'm like, is this necessary? They even gave me like a little fire truck, like a little Toyota truck with like a bell on it to go to the fires. After like the third five stopped showing up for two months. They could, where are you zero? The base where he lives. And I'm just starting to cope.

Speaker 1:          06:25          Get my dick sucked. You want me to go put out a fire and a dumpster? Go Fuck you. So they came over and took the dumpster and then I went to work for this other Dude Dick. There was three decks. The Guy I worked for was Dick [inaudible], Dick Kelly and Dick Boone was demand. So I had a buddy used to go, you're surrounded by Dick Dick, Dick, Dick. So Dick Kelly had one of those snow companies and they wanted me to go and uh, I don't know what that called Joe Rogan. So straighten me out. It's a high low, that's shovel snow. What's a high low, high low boy? And the warehouse was, oh shit. Ball truck pushed it snow around. So he was another poor bastard that made a mistake and hired me that winter. And yeah, I had to be that fought in the morning. Four in the morning.

Speaker 1:          07:09          I'm on my second grandmother blow. He'd be in front of my house beeping. Bam. I'm going to go fuck herself. I'm not working tonight. He came and took his truck. I was on a roll up then. It's not a fucking row for like plowed snow guys who had snow trucks when it would snow out. Man, that was the, you aren't getting any sleep. Uh, there was a bunch of guys that I knew in Colorado on shop Boston from Boston. Yeah, that's, that's, that's a business. It's a business in the wintertime. You know, as soon as you get snow, most people start to fucking get unhappy and people would look out the window with the coffee and making sure you're out there with the truck up the driveway, pushing snow around. My Buddy Jimmy, he had a, there was one of his side businesses. He was an electrician, the side business.

Speaker 1:          07:56          He had a, he had a plow on his pickup truck and we just fucking plow people out. Do People's driveways. You know, it's, I was, I went home this year, March 20th I went home to Jersey. I had to do is show one night or Nyack and me and Arya hooked up in the city way that a bull. We walked around the city and the snow had just started to snow. You know, and I, by the time I got up the next morning, it's no like a foot. I'd never seen anything like that. Like when I was a kid in jersey, if it snowed, that shit was there. Like that shit stayed for state dance. There was no school stacked up on the side of the sidewalk. Nerdy snow from my town won't let up. Fucking ounce of Snow Lan, not an inch. Really bad. Fucking tremendous that night the roads would clean.

Speaker 1:          08:44          He's color. I'll never forget how when I left Jersey and 83 like if it snowed, like let's say if it's snowed and had had to take the bus up here, I would just call you and say Joe, which smelling and you'd expect me at 11 and you know, everything was late whenever it snowed in Jersey. He has this big metropolitan area in New York City and it snowed that cripple the city. They didn't know how to hand newspapers wouldn't come. People get pissed off the New York Post. I remember moving to Snowmass and getting a job at aspen electric and that meant I had to get on a bus in Snowmass, go to the bottom of the hill, transfer and shoot the bus to Snowmass. I did this and I remember the first time we got, I woke up one day and you know in Colorado you wake up one morning, this 12 inches, it's just another day.

Speaker 1:          09:34          Just another day. And I remember the 1983 they couldn't fucking clean up New York, but I'll never forget that morning waking up and ask him like at six 30 and Snowmass and going, they're not going to expect me to about 10 and I walked in there at 10 the people like, what the fuck have you been? And I'm like, it snowed out. The buses are running late. They go, everybody else here came out of the bus and they all got here on time. They fucking busted me right out like Colorado was that far ahead of the game? Well, they're just so used to it. It was so, but like here I was living in this big metropolitan city that four inches crippled.
