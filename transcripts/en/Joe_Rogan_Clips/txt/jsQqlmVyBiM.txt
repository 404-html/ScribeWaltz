Speaker 1:          03:42          There's a bunch of little browns running around. You know what has happened many times more than once is these doctors, if fertility clinics swap out, other peoples come for their own and they have a bunch of their, their own babies running around. Like these people have wanted specific genetics and this one redheaded doctor just shoot loads of the cups and then everybody's like, hey, why isn't my fucking kid have red hair? The fuck? Where's your nerdy man? One doctor got arrested. I think he fathered like a hundred children. Oh my God. Damn crazy. Crazy person or awesome. Give it back to the world. I think he's just a crazy person because as a seed, yeah, he was running a sperm bank or a fertility clinic, one of those and he just decided, nope, it's going to be all me. All my loads out there too.

Speaker 1:          05:22          I think there's been a bunch of these guys throughout history. I think they should test every one of those guys. They should make sure that they're not doing that. Anybody running a fertility clinic? It tickets. It's like you get bored over and over again. Guys are jacking off in the cops and you're like, you know what? Make my day exciting.
