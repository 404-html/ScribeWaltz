He was a real nice guy though. Did he pass away? Oh, thanks. Yeah. Yeah. I check it. A feeling she's good. You know, it's really fucking sick, bro. Yeah, buddy. The one guy you introduced me to from that baseball show you the Spanish guy that was on there with you. A nice guy.

Who, uh, the Spanish guy that came to visit you at the store a few times. He's sick and guy. Yeah, I just donated to his golf. There's a dude from star trek. Remember that? That dude, it's in star trek all the time. Uh, fucking, what is his name? God dammit. But he was the older picture and I was the young asshole ballplayer. What was that? Betty wife? Yeah, she was not Betty. Was it Betty White? No, the other lady from uh, what's the cast? Some, God damn it. I don't remember a name. See if you can find the cast. Yeah, but you don't want images.

Speaker 1:          02:03          Yeah. Ben Greenwood. He thought guys in star. He's in a bunch of movies now and Dan Florick. He was in law and order, but go the other way. That dude, it only went worth, she was hilarious. She been in a bunch of shit. Chris Browning, he was on, he's been a bunch of stuff recently. Waze bike. Fucking weird man. What year was that? What years? It said it was 94 four, four. That's when I had to move to California. I was miserable. I was shooting this the first couple of days, look at me like I was like 26. There are so weird. Um, you know what man, when, when it first started out it was fun. And then, um, what happened was with twit TV shows, a lot of times you have like these really funny writers and these guys who wrote it originally were really good. But the uh, they had written from married with children, the Simpsons and the network had decided for some reason that they weren't strong enough to run the show and that they, they were only writers.

Speaker 1:          03:08          They weren't like a real show runner. So they brought in, this guy was a show runner, he was terrible and I didn't get along with him at all and they were actually close to firing me or him. Like there was like a real like impasse between the two of us cause the guys riding was dog shit. I was crazy back then. Dude, I didn't give a fuck. I had zero filter. I never thought it was going to be an actor in the first place. I couldn't believe him on the set. And so they would try to get me to do stuff and I'll be like, what? And they would like give me the script. Like, well we made revisions to the script and I would read that goes, this is fucking terrible. And they would get pissed at me and people be pissed. I'm like, tell me how this is funny.

Speaker 1:          03:44          Explained to me how this is funny. And then you know, like executives are going, you know, you're either, we're talking to my agent, this guy, you know, he's, he's very arrogant and, and you know, he's, he's causing problems on the set and I'm like, I'm not causing problems in the set. I go, they took the writer stuff, they rewrote it and they turned into dog shit. You show me, show me how it's not. And I, and I, I was like very close to like killing my sitcom career completely just by having no filter. Well then they realized it, they read it and then they came, has watched some of the run throughs. And the network fired him, but it was close. He wanted me out, but I was one of the stars of the show. It was me and that Ben Greenwood Guy, but, and then, I mean it was a, it was an ensemble show, but I played the star player.

Speaker 1:          04:30          There was, there was about a baseball team, a fucked up baseball team. And I was the, the guy who was always causing trouble and wrecking his car and going crazy. And so they were having a real problem with me. But it was, it w it was because these guys that had originally wrote it, these guys were genius. They were really, really funny and they took their words and just butchered it and turned into something hackneyed fucked up sitcoms. What they usually do. Well, Jim Brewer was in the pilot with me. Jim Brewer. That was me. I looked like a baby. So weird. Um, so Jim brewer was in the pilot with me. He played the mascot for the team. Fuck. He was funny man. And Jim and I were buddies from New York. There's Jim as Jim Brewer. No, Jim Breuer played the pioneer who, uh, he had like the, the bay, I feel like, like he got in a fight, Jeff Curran and Kevin Martin back that up right there where you see the, the Lens on the screen.

Speaker 1:          05:32          Yeah. Where you see the words like right there, Kevin Curran rather than chef Martin. Sorry, I fucked her. Name's up Kevin Kern and Jeff Martin with the guys who wrote it. And um, they were really, really nice guys and really funny guys, but they were writers, you know, and this was something that they'd created and then the network just butchered it and then it wound up getting canceled. And then I was ready to move back to New York, but I fucked up. And I had already got a lease on an apartment. I got an apartment on Moore Park in studio city, or it was actually north Hollywood. And, uh, I was like, fuck, I already got this apartment. Like, what do I do? And so I'm like, God, I gotta stay here because I've got a lease. And I was like, shit, I want to move back to New York. I hated it out here.

Speaker 2:          06:18          [inaudible] okay.
