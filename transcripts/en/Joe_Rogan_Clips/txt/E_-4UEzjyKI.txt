Speaker 1:          00:00          Her low freak bitches. It's like there's no, there's no respect for like, like what we have, how much different, how much higher standard of living we live. Then the vast, you know, uh, most humans that are alive today and the vast majority of humans who have ever existed. I mean, it's like, what is, I get this from a Jordan Peterson lecture, uh, but he said, uh, it was an 1895. The average American lived on a dollar a day adjusted for modern inflation. So in 1895, you know, it's like, like central Asia level poverty in America and that's just everyone. Before that living in backbreaking poverty was like just life. That was just all of life. And it's like we figured something out in these last, uh, uh, less than 200 years, you know, like we figured something out a little more than 200 years. We've figured something out.

Speaker 1:          00:48          Wait, what am I saying? No, no, no, let's listen. 200 years. We've figured something out in this industrial revolution that like now lets us live up here on this end. It's like, we can lose that. And a lot of it has to do with freedom, but the whole thing to me is freedom. The whole thing is that we embrace, look, if you look in in the year, um, uh, and uh, that you had on your show, Thaddeus Russell, who's great, I just did his podcast recently and he put it this way, uh, where he goes, you know, in the year 1800, cause I was talking about what an incredible thing the 19th century was and how it transformed humanity. And he goes to the, in the year 1800 Americans are all making their own clothes in the year 1900. Uh, Americans are shopping at Macy's. Like we, if you had said in the year, you know, in the year 1845 and been like, dude, in the next 65 years, slavery is going to be abolished in the West and we're going to have an industrial revolution.

Speaker 1:          01:37          You know, it's like magic happen and that's why we live the way we live today. And no one is even interested in that story, right? Like why do we have this much wealth? I like what you said. I think it's all about freedom and when you have a guy like Bernie Sanders who harps on and on about income inequality, I have a real issue with that because it's one of those blanket statements that sounds really good at a campaign speech, but freedom itself breeds income inequality. Yes, because freedom means you can do whatever you want. You can do very little or you can work like a maniac. Well, if you're going to work, like if you're, if here's the game, okay, you do something for that. Something. You get currency, you use that currency to buy things or to make sure you don't have to work again by food and goods and take trips and travel.

Speaker 1:          02:22          The more you work, the more you decide that you want to pursue something, the more chances you have to acquire their currency. If you do it correctly. That is income inequality due to freedom. I mean take away all the other factors that might be, you know, in play, whether it's racial discrimination or sexual discrimination. I'm not denying that those things exist. But what I am saying is that the idea that you are going to have income equality in a capitalist society where anybody could do whenever they want, you know, people that is so counter to what we know about human behavior. This is, you're talking about a fantasy person who exist, who has motivations outside of wealth outside of, uh, you know, that most people want some sort of reward for what they do. And if everybody gets the same amount, there's no fucking reward for working extra hard.

Speaker 1:          03:12          And that's going to where you're not going to get Microsoft, you're not going to get IBM. It's going to get just, I mean, it's not, it's not just, I mean they talk about fairness a lot, which is a strange concept, but it's not just that somebody works twice as hard and doesn't get more, I mean that's, that that's not the right thing to do anyway. But like what you were saying, and I just think it's like they use the term so much, but what's misleading about it? You're absolutely right, that freedom breeds inequality. But what's misleading about it is that people think like the poor get poorer. And that is objective. That is a, a you like objective lead false, demonstrably false. It's not that, you know, they make it out like the rich get richer and the poor get poorer like that old saying, but it's like that, you know, if you think it through like that can't really continue like that.

Speaker 1:          03:51          No, but the poor guy was going to have rich. But if the poor work hard and figure they haven't possibility to escape whatever economic situation they're in, it is possible with freedom and homeless people here live better than, than rich people in Third World countries or I'm certainly at least better than average people in third world countries. Uh, so it's like, it's not just that the inequality grows, it's like everything moves up and the inequality grows up here. And this is like what I just, what I can't understand. And, and again, it's like why I was saying before, like if you have any concept of the fact that we're by far the richest freest human beings who have ever existed in recorded human history, at least recorded human history. Who knows what is going on in ancient Egypt, but like a pro before in Geneva.

Speaker 1:          04:33          But uh, but if you realize that we have this incredible amount, then it's like, yeah, it's like just being like, oh, we need all of these policies to like give handouts to poor people. It's like, well actually let's continue this train of getting richer and richer and richer, which is not at all, you know, like what, what people like Bernie Sanders, man. It's like, well, it's a hustle. Bernie's got a hustle going on. Yeah. And just find out a shell. So you find out it's a hustle when you find out he's got a bunch of houses and his wife tried to buy up all this fucking land to expand a university that she was running and she killed the whole fucking school. Like you. How about the fact that the motherfucker and we haven't seen, so first off he, he made $1 million off a book on how it's wrong to be a millionaire.

Speaker 1:          05:15          I mean it's, it's like how are you not, how can anyone look at you like as a serious leader when you did that? So you know saying what people want to hear and there is something, some truth to some of the things that he's saying. I think that the world would be a better place if we had more social programs in place. I think the world be a better place if college were free. If we, I think, I mean I don't disagree with like the thought behind that. I think that all of these things would be better suited in voluntary arrangements then some force government monopoly. But I do agree with you that like sure. I'd like great schools to be very affordable or free if possible. I'd like everyone to be [inaudible] and Bernie Sanders certainly addressed some very real problems. Like he would point things out that were very real. Like he would be like, you know, they claim it's a great recovery, but you know, 90% of the new wealth has gone to the top 3%. You know, like he eat up some points.

Speaker 1:          06:04          I only do one or two and that has to apply to every New York Jew who's out there. Uh, but like, so like there is some, and I don't care if Bernie Sanders makes $1 million, but there is something like number one, making $1 million while claiming it's kind of a moral issue that some people have so much. What others have so bad. All Endorsing Hillary Clinton. I mean, I just don't know how you can, how you can look at the guy who goes, the problem is incoming inequality and these [inaudible] and the banking, you know, cartel. But I'm going to vote for the candidate of the big banks. Like to me that's, that's insane. It, it would, to me it would be if Ron Paul endorsed McCain. Well don't you think the big banks sort of were on both teams? Yeah, well not, I don't know if they were on Trump's team, but they've certainly been on. Every other team decides that now. Yeah. Yeah. No, certainly. I'm absolutely, it's only like the team. They run the Treasury Department in the Federal Reserve, like they run the whole system, but the fact that Bernie Sanders never had like a fiery speech about what happened at the DNC about how they literally conspired to ruin him and to take him out of the race with Hillary because they, the DNC wanted Hillary to be the candidate.

Speaker 2:          07:15          Okay.
