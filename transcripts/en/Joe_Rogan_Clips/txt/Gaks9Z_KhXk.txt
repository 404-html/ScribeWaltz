Speaker 1:          00:00          Her low freak bitches, but I do. I do feel like the country is divided to a point of like, I don't know, we're not going to be honest. Again, it's not, it doesn't seal on the Internet. It's bad. I got my, I got my news a lot from the daily show. What I would watch the daily show and I would see, I feel like Jon Stewart is a obviously a very left leaning guy, but he's also a very smart guy in a very funny guy and when he would talk about like events in the news and mock them and show clips and mock the clips, that to me is a way better version of what I would get. Like I can discern what's a joke, I can discern how he's making fun, but then I will also get the actual information of these events from him as well.

Speaker 1:          00:45          That to me is a way better version of news entertainment than what fucking CNN is doing. Cause with CNN is doing is having s what are essentially actors like really boring people that are reading some stupid shit off a teleprompter. Like you take fucking Anderson Cooper away from the news. What? Who was Anderson Cooper? What do you, are you interesting dude? You know what? Let's have him talk. Have him give a speech somewhere. Have him talk to people, have him have him do, do a standup routine. He's boring as shit. I bet. You know what I'm saying to me that if you're watching an entertainer give you the news, which is essentially what CNN is doing, right? Fucking John Stewart should be on CNN. Yeah. But then he'd have to like go to work every day. He didn't want to do that. Right. Is that what he's, his deal is he doesn't want to work and you know, he, I mean he doesn't want the daily show after so many years.

Speaker 1:          01:30          I mean, I was there for a lunch. I talked to John a lot. I think a lot of it is just the, the feeling of like, you know, doing it a talk show four nights a week, every day and calling through all that news. Like we were giving people the little golden nuggets that happened throughout the day. But like we have to watch it. Like, you know, we were absorbing a lot of like radiation from all that stuff and like, you know, like the closer you yard of the radiation, the more you know your, your hair gets grade, your soul hurts after a while. And I think for John, I mean I, I think him leaving when he left, it was a good way to do it. You just make a bunch of money and say, oh that's it. No, it wasn't even the money. I think it was just, he felt like, and he said it on the last show.

Speaker 1:          02:07          I wasn't there for the, I mean I, I'd stopped working there before he retired, but I think he just got to a point where he said like, I'm not doing this at the level I could do it at anymore. Therefore someone else should do it. Like he was telling, he used, he was just kind of, he did it, you know. And I think if you waited through this election, which people were like, I wish she was to align. It's like, yeah, but now Trump would be in and then everyone would be like, you can't quit. No try. You know, like he'd be, he'd be stuck in it forever, you know? And I think he just wanted to walk away like on the top, you know, like the way, you know, like a retire after a super bowl win kind of thing. You know, people forget that he wasn't the original host.

Speaker 1:          02:40          Isn't that fascinating? Yeah. At Kilborne was, yeah. What happened to that guy? I don't know. I never worked there with Kilborne. I started like six months after John Stewart started and uh, so I've heard a lot of like funny Kilborne stories. Like he was a good dude and he was a really funny guy. But like definitely much more of a read the teleprompter. Yeah. Read what they put in. The prompts are kind of, you know, Raga Ron Burgundy style, you know, fuck yourself. San Diego. Yeah. Great job with, uh, John. When John came on and he was like really a writer, producer mind. There was definitely like a sea change at the shadow of like the writers. The original writers go on like, what the hell? Hey Buddy, don't ruin our little show. And he was like, man, I don't know if you understand how this is going to work. You know? There was a little girl, there was like a clash a little bit, a little bit. What was their vision that he was just going to read whatever they wrote? Yeah. Period. Yeah, I think so. But he's a really funny comic. Why wouldn't they want him to contribute and make it funnier? Right? Yeah. I don't know. I mean, it worked out in his favor. I think his contributions ended up making the show pretty down, honestly. Yeah. But Egos are a motherfucker, man. It's fun. It's always an odd thing.

Speaker 2:          03:53          Okay.
