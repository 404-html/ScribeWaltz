Speaker 1:          00:00          Now, before the podcast started, you were telling me that you wrote a 30 page paper on the Carnivore Diet. It's not a paper. Well, it's, I definitely spent about 30 pages. I thought about it for a long time. And yes, there's 30 pages of thoughts and references. Were you stunned that this became, I mean, this is a very recent thing. Yeah. People were just eating meat. Well, at first when I was, I think Dan told me about it like couple of years ago even like, and I thought there's no way I was like, I just ignored it, but craze barely have time for that. Right. So, yeah, I definitely, um, dismissed it when I, when I first heard about it. But it's definitely been something that has gained a lot of traction, you know, sending disturb you that it's getting traction. Well, I definitely have concerns. Um, you know, I think that the, the most important question really is what is attracting someone to try such a very restrictive diet.

Speaker 1:          01:11          You know, that potentially could be dangerous without published evidence or any sort of long term studies and things like that. So I think that the first question really is, well, why are people doing this? And so looking on the Internet and try to like read about people's anecdotes. Um, it seems as though a lot of people are drawn to it because they have some sort of autoimmune problem and uh, so they try this diet and it improves their autoimmune symptoms. And I see that seems to be a real common theme in you, at least if you, if you look in the blog is peers and stuff like that. Um, so that's I think kind of a good place to start where it's like, well, you know, what are people doing this for? And then, uh, so that's, that's kind of an important question and I'm so, so further reading about this diet, it sort of sort of think about, well, okay, well what's going on?

Speaker 1:          02:05          It's really important when you have like something that leads to a, an effect to understand the mechanism because the mechanism is you know, what's leading to this effect. And so if you can do something that's potentially not so dangerous or risky, then understanding the mechanism will help you. Because then you can find other ways to do it. Right. And so, um, if you look at at uh, published studies on people that eat low carb, high protein diets, um, what's pretty common is that there, there's changes that happen in a variety of different endocrine factors. I'm like, you're less insulin that's changing your satiety and hunger hormones, Leptin and Ghrelin and people become more satiated and they actually eat less. And this has been shown in multiple studies so people actually eat less when they're having a higher protein diet, which makes sense too because protein is more satiating, uh, as well.

Speaker 1:          02:58          Um, and also there's also been studies on what's called food habituation. Uh, we're basically, so habituation is when you're constantly exposed to the same stimulus, you sort of have a decreased response to that stimulus where there's been intervention trials where people are given the same food every single day, both non obese and obese people versus people that are giving the same food once a week. And the people that are given the same food every single day, they just, they start to eat less calories, so they start to eat less naturally started to cal work, restrict themselves. Um, so I mean, and that's, it's kind of like a dietary monotony because sort of thing. So I think there are any, you know, if you read and the people out there on the blogs talking about this diet, they say, I'm like, I'm eating less. I only eat twice a day.

Speaker 1:          03:41          I'm fasting. You know, so that's, people are talking about that as well. So I think there's published evidence to kind of explain that. And also there's, you know, people thing. Yeah, I eat less. So that's an important point because one thing that's really known to affect autoimmunity is caloric restriction and fasting. Like it's probably one of the most well known, um, technologies that you can intervene and have improvements in autoimmune disease. So, um, some of that has to do with the fact that you can sort of reset your immune system. There have been animal studies and human studies, a lot of this done by doctor Valter Longo at USC. Uh, he's done some prolonged fasting, um, in animals. And also there's been sort of like a fasting mimicking diet done in humans, which kind of very low calorie diet. This sort of is meant to mimic fast.

Speaker 1:          04:30          Um, and those have shown that, um, you basically kind of crossover because fasting is a type of stress you cross over into this like stronger stress response where you're not only like cleaning away all the gunk and the sides of cells. People talk about a toffee g lot when they're talking about fasting. You clean away things like damaged, you know, pieces of DNA, protein aggregates, things like that. Mitochondria that are damaged get cleared out. But you also sort of start to clear away entire cells through a process called apoptosis. And in animal studies, what's been shown is that if you do, for example, a 72 hour fast, you can clear away about 30% of the immune system and, and, and, and re replenish it with like brand new healthy immune cells and literally like Oregon's shrink when, during the fasting and then they'd like re-expand because you're activating stem cells and you're, you're, you know, basically replenishing all your damaged old cells with new ones.

Speaker 1:          05:27          We'll vaulter is shown in this animal studies. Also autoimmune, um, uh, cells tend to be selectively killed off and replaced with non on immune cells. So he's also done a clinical study, a pilot clinical study with people with multiple sclerosis doing this fast mimicking diet for one month, sorry for one week. And um, there there's symptoms improved. Also a ketogenic diet was done side by side and Ketogenic Diet also improves symptoms of autoimmunity. So those both were done in humans. So I think that, um, you know, understanding that, you know, some of these mechanisms that are at play and not fasting itself and calorie restriction, both have been shown to approve autoimmunity. You may be tapping into something there by eating last. That's one possibility. Um, in addition, there's been clinical studies in humans where they were done, they were basically fasted for 24 hours every other day for 15 days.

Speaker 1:          06:19          So they had like a total of seven days of fasting. And these are also people with multiple sclerosis. And there's profound changes in the microbiome that started happening. And this was an in line with basically, um, having, you know, a lot of anti inflammatory cytokines basically producing immune cells that are really important for preventing autoimmunity called t regulatory cells and things like that. So that's another really important thing to consider is, you know, the microbiome because the microbiome has been linked to autoimmunity in multiple, multiple studies. I mean, it's been linked to arthritis. It's been linked to multiple sclerosis. It's been linked to other diseases like Parkinson's, which is not really autoimmune. But, um, and the point of this is that, you know, again, understanding mechanism and realizing, you know, there's other potential factors that could be leading to an effect, right? It's, it's actually, um, the, the changes in the microbiome are really important because there's actually been a few animal studies which have led to phase one, phase two and phase three clinical trials that have been done in humans.

Speaker 1:          07:23          So humans with multiple sclerosis, we're treated with [inaudible] cycling and antibiotic, and they'd been basically the antibiotic was shown to improve symptoms and multiple sclerosis. And because there there's good bacteria and bad bacteria that had been linked to autoimmunity and getting rid of getting rid of bacteria, the bad bacteria is going to probably lead to improvement. And that's what was shown first and the animal studies and then in human trials. So humans, I'm taking with multiple sclerosis, taking Munis cycling for two years. So basically they had improvements to delay the onset, um, uh, progression of the disease. Then after two years, those improvements went away probably because you're wiping out the microbiome and eventually you're also getting rid of the, the good bacteria and so that things are going to catch up, right? So you're not just, you may be getting rid of some of the pathogenic bad bacteria with antibiotics, but eventually, like you're also getting rid of good stuff.

Speaker 1:          08:14          So longterm, you know, you may not have those same improvements. And that, and that's a very interesting and I think it's really important point to understand, um, with, with something like, you know, change is very profound changes in the microbiome when it comes to someone just eating meat. Um, so one thing to keep in mind with, with the microbiome is that basically a bacteria really are good at adapting to their environment. That's why antibiotic resistance is such a big deal. And when you, there's been human intervention studies, when you take a human that goes from a high fiber diet to a low fiber, high protein or vice versa, you get changes in their gut microbiome that happened within 24 hours. So within an hour you actually start to have doubling of populations of bacteria. And within 24 to 48 hours, do you actually start to lose other, so basically other bacteria start to die off.

Speaker 1:          09:08          And this is at the species level. It's really hard to change. The phyla of the file is more linked to longterm dietary patterns. Eventually you can change file as well, but it's been shown that people that go from a, um, a more high fiber to a high protein diet, they tap changed their microbiome. And these changes are a lot of the microbiome, you know, bacteria that are fermenting a variety of fermentable fibers start to leave and you actually start to get bacteria cropping up that ferment amino acids. So the amino acids, amino acids, simple sugars, thoughts, those are mostly absorbed in the small intestine, but some of them make their way into the large intestine. And there's a whole, you know, group of bacteria called putrifactive bacteria and they ferment amino acids. And some of these species of, of putrifactive bacteria has been linked to colon cancer.

Speaker 1:          10:01          Uh, there are much higher and colon cancer patients. Animal studies have shown, you know, causal links where they can basically regressively cause a polyp to, to form a tumor. Um, and that's because these bacteria are making things called pewter scene and cadaveric [inaudible], which are damaging their Gina toxic agents that damaged the DNA inside your colon cells. And so, um, people that are typically eating like a omnivore type of buyer, whether eating protein and they're also eating fermentable fiber. If they're eating the fermentable fiber that's facilitating the growth of lactic acid producing bacteria, it, that limits the growth of putrifactive B. So if you're, if you're, you know, bifidobacteria, lactobacillus, s mutans as Thermophilus, those strains of bacteria, the lactic acid producing bacteria, which you'd be getting if you're, I mean, you, you'd be facilitating the growth of if you're eating plants fermentable with fermentable fiber, you're going to limit the growth of putrifactive because they can't grow with lactic acid because it's not like, you know, you have, it's not a huge, huge concern. But the question is, what happens when you're only eating? I mean, I'll ask him, you're only getting amino acids, you know, so is there a long term? So if you're, if you're, if you're killing off potentially some of this, um, pathogenic bacteria and you're having this effect where a positive effect, what's going to happen long term, it's not known. I mean, this died. I mean, it hasn't really been studied at that level. I've

Speaker 2:          11:24          been a few people that have, have anecdotal stories about doing it for 10, 20 years that are online, but it's very difficult to track. You know, I mean, it's, it's that you have to take them at their word for it. They've eaten nothing but meat for 20 years. They feel amazing. But there's not very many of them. There's a, yeah, there's a, well, there may be more out there, but it's in terms of like what I've come across articles, uh, you know, uh, just, uh, social media profiles, people talked about the positive benefits of it. It seems to me that people that are talking about the positive benefits are talking about it within a one and two year window. That's, that's what we're really dealing with a lot of. Um, Sean Baker, Dr. Sean Baker who is probably the leading proponent of it or one of the poster boys of it along with Jordan Peterson and his daughter Mckayla.

Speaker 2:          12:08          Uh, Jordan Peterson has daughter Mikayla. They're different in that they were dealing with severe autoimmune issues. Uh, his daughters had two joints replaced but before she was 18, she had her, well she had her ankle replaced before she was 18 and I think she had her hip replaced shortly after that. And um, Jordan has had some pretty severe autoimmune issues and depression within both, both of them. Those things were cleared up. But as you've talked about multiple times before on this show, depression has been linked to disorders in the gut biome. Right. And this is something that you feel like may be contributing to this as long as, as well as both of them also got very lean. Jordan lost a ton of weight. He's back to the weight that he was when he was 25 years old. And I've eaten with him and the guy eats, he eats a lot, but it's a lot of meat just like he'll eat like a 30 ounce steak, you know, which is just crazy. It's a crazy amount of meat. But um, I don't know how many times he's doing that a day. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          13:12          Yeah. Yeah. I think I, you know, going back to the, the point, it's like there are other, in understanding the mechanism is important and there's a lot of potential confounding factors, right? And that with any anecdotal data is extremely important to consider. I mean, people can't even neutrino scientists, nutritionists and just people can't even agree on the best diet because a lot of these epidemiological and observational studies, which don't establish causation, have an enormous amount of confounding factors. And it is freaking, it's so hard to like control for that. I mean, just as a perfect example, we've talked about this before on the podcast, but you know, the vegetarian versus people that eat meat, one of the really large studies that was done and, and, and doctor Valter Longo was part of that study looked in at all cause mortality and cancer mortality. And it was lower in vegetarians, but they decided to take the mediators and say, okay, what about within this group?

Speaker 1:          14:09          The people that are healthy meat eaters are people that are, you know, not, you know, not unhealthy. So they're not obese, they're not sedentary, they're not smoking and alcohol, not excessively drinking alcohol. Those people, when they took out that those confounding factors, the mediators had the same mortality as the vegetarian. Yeah. Same Cancer. So confounding factors are so important and that with anything with anecdotal, you have people that are exercising like crazy. Exercise has also been shown to change microbiome, independent of diet, um, in a positive way where you're actually producing more of the bacteria that are producing things like lactic acid. So, and fasting does the same thing. And so you have people that are fasting. So, you know, it's not like you can't do other things if you're on that type of bed to, to sort of help with the microbiome. But I think, again, if there's a way you can do, you know, if there's a way that you can get these benefits without having to do something so hyper restrictive and we'll talk about, I mean, I have concerns for that.

Speaker 1:          15:05          We can definitely get into that. But, um, then you know, why not try that. And you know, the thing with like, for example, doing like a prolonged fast, you know, once, once a quarter, once every couple of months, depending on how severe your your issues are. I mean, there's, there's been benefits shown with that. Like an aging, like, you know, so people that have been put on this fasting mimicking diet, they have improved biomarkers of aging. They increase their lean muscle mass. I mean, so like I said, an animal studies, and you can't directly translate the animal studies to humans because rodents have a really fast metabolism and if you fast them for 48 hours, they lose 20% of their body weight. Where humans only lose like one or 2%. I mean, that's like clearly, you know? Yeah. So, yeah, so you can't, I mean, it's obviously you can't completely translate everything that's done in a fascinating road to humans, but there are definitely organs are shrinking and then literally regrowing after the fast is over.

Speaker 1:          16:01          Like it's like this rejuvenation process, you know, and it seems as though selectively damage cells are killed. In fact, this whole, like there, there's a whole, um, doctor Valter Longo showing, um, that cancer cells are really, really susceptible to dying when they're, when you do like a, a prolonged fast or even a fasting mimicking diet. And he's, he's, he's shown this in animal studies and you send a couple of clinical studies, uh, were, were patients with cancer were treated with standard of care, but before their standard care treatment, they were fascinated for up to 72 hours. And what happens, um, what he's shown in animal studies happens is that because the fasting is a type of stress, all your healthy cells increase all these stress response pathways. They make more heat shock proteins. They're increasing antioxidant production pathways. Antiinflammatory, they're doing all this really good stuff in response.

Speaker 1:          16:49          Cancer cells can't do that. They're like screwed up. And so they can't activate those stress response pathways. So it ends up killing them. So what you end up happening, happening happening is that when you're giving another genotoxic stress like chemo or radiation, your healthy cells become more resistant to the damaging effects of the radiation and the cancer cells become more sensitized to the death. And so what he's shown in his pilot studies in humans is that basically, um, the humans that were true, that were, uh, that were treated with the standard of care, I think it was chemo and also fasted, they had less neutropenia, which is the loss of like neutrophils, which is the side effect because you're losing normal healthy cells. They had less of that happening, uh, less myelosuppression. Um, so I mean, anyways, the point is that I think if you can find a way to get positive benefits, you know, without having to do something so risky and potentially dangerous and unstudied um, you know, I mean unstudied in a really scientific way, you know, controlling for compounding factors. And all sorts of longterm, I mean just all of that, it's really important.

Speaker 2:          17:53          Well then just comprehensive breakdown that you just did is something that's really lacking from a lot of discussion of this carnivore diet. And from the proponents of it, it's almost like a lot of them are going into it blind folded. They'll like, look, uh, it seems to be working, so I'm just going to stick with it. But again, when you're talking about most people's cases, you're talking about one year, maybe two years, sometimes even less, where they're having these benefits. And as you're saying, it's entirely possible that they're setting themselves up for some potential longterm damage.

Speaker 1:          18:29          It is. Um, it is, it's definitely possible. And again, at the end of the day, there's no data, there's no data. So you can say for sure. Right, right, right. There's no data, but I have concerns and we can talk about those concerns for sure. I like to, but you know, the thing is understanding mechanism, like you said, going in blindly. I mean, you have a hypothesis and it's like, okay, your hypothesis is all plants are bad. Yeah, that's what I keep hearing and it's like, wow, that's a hypothesis, but what about all the other things that are potentially happening while you're doing this diet and you're fasting more, your microbiomes changing, like dramatically changing and those things all have been known. Multiple studies have shown in humans and animals mechanistic detail to have benefits on autoimmunity, on aging in general, on brain function. I mean all sorts of things, you know, so it's mechanism is so important. You have to realize that that's the whole basis of science. Understanding how the world works around you, understanding how your body works, mechanisms like, right. You have hypothesis and it's very, and I understand it's like someone experiences something positive. It's like, well this must be, this is it. This is the end all be all. But you have to realize the shits complicated. You got to understand the mechanism. You may be doing something long term that potentially, I mean it really hasn't been studied. Yes. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          19:53          Well, that was one of the, I mean I had Jordan's daughter Mikayla on, who's had some pretty dramatic results from this carnivore diet, but she's giving essentially nutrition consulting to people, but she doesn't really have a background in it and she's in, she doesn't have the information that you just distributed, like what you just said to all these people listening and that the way you're describing the, the mechanisms and the benefits of fasting and all these different various things that are happening inside your gut and all these different things that are happening with healthy cells and damaged cells with fasting and that this is mimicked by this restrictive diet. And then this is all absent from the dialogue. This is all absent from the dust. And this is one of the things is disturbing the most disturbing for me. It's like I get that they're seeing positive results.

Speaker 2:          20:41          I get, I don't know. I know I can, I deny that they're receiving, but when they start saying, uh, you know, plants are bad and there's a, you know, like my friend Chris, he's always talking about the war on carbs. He's having us. He's also got Chris Bell, he's got autoimmune issues as well. He's had both of his hips replaced before he was 35 and you know, severe arthritis. And he is leaner than he's ever been and benefiting greatly from this carnivore diet. But you know, he's, he's like, he talks about it like he uses Hashtag war on carbs, you know, and he doesn't eat salad, he won't eat greens. Greens are bad for you. And I'm like, man, I don't not sure that's correct. I think it's so important what you're saying. And um, there's a, uh, a researcher online that I've been in contact with. [inaudible] name's Kevin Bass and his, uh, at bass or bass B a s s not sure which, how do you pronounce it? But he also brought up this possibility that it could be a calorie restriction that these people are dealing with. And that is essentially some of the same mechanisms that are the, the positive reactions from fascinating that you're, you're dealing with here. And I'm very happy that you're saying the same thing.

Speaker 1:          21:55          Yeah, I think that is one very strong possibility. And that is something, you know, there's lots of hypotheses here and you know, given all the data and there's lots of positive data about eating plants as well, you know, so it's, it's really hard. That's one hypothesis and that seems to be the one everyone's sort of gravitating to. Hmm. Um, you know, if, if someone is also wanting to reduce their, their glycemic load and all that, I mean there's, there are other, I mean, eating just a modified Paleo Diet. I mean, I eat something like a modified Paleo Diet where it's like I'm eating, I'm eating fish, I meat meat, poultry and then a lot of leafy Greens and cruciferous vegetables. Now you can do something nuts, you know, or you can do a ketogenic diet and like, they're, like, I just talked about the study, um, that was done looking at the fasting mimicking diet and humans with multiple sclerosis sclerosis.

Speaker 1:          22:47          Um, there was, uh, the same in publishing the same um, paper. There was a study they studied that put patients on Ketogenic Diet for, I believe it was three months and it improves symptoms of autoimmunity as well. Was it comparable? Yeah, yeah. Improvements. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. So, you know, the ketogenic diet or modified ketogenic diet is also, you know, there's also concerns with that. Not everyone responds very well and you know, the micronutrient deficiencies have been a concern, but you can actually eat a lot of, um, vegetable vegetables, the green, a good ones that are, that are low in glycemic. So spinning my concern exactly. My concerns are much, much less. Yeah. Um, and there's, it's been studied a lot more. I mean, at least there's been lifespans studies in animals on cogenic diet where it's like improving, you know, the way they age, it's improving their cognitive function, brain aging, extending their lifespan.

Speaker 1:          23:38          So, you know, if people are looking for, in addition to, you know, wanting to help with their autoimmunity issues, you know, there's also, if it's like, well, I also just don't want to have a lot of insulin response. I want to lower my glycaemic levels and things like that. Um, it seems like a much better option than, than doing something completely unstudied. And so, um, you know, I think that's a really good place to start. And obviously not disregarding everyone's anecdotes. And of course she's also the placebo and no seatbelt effect, which are very real. I mean, extremely real. It's why a lot of drugs don't ever make it to market is because they can't beat placebo. You know, where it's like people think they're going to get a positive response from something they can. And the opposite is true. People think they're going to get a negative response for something they can.
