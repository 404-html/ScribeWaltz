Speaker 1:          00:00          Phobias guy that was promoting something recently that Hillary was 50% reptilian. 50%. I've heard 30% I can believe, but 50 50 is a wall half. Yeah. See if you can find that. Someone said she has 50% reptilian blood. Well, you know that was a David Eick thing for the longest time. The reptilians. Yeah, I remember he was saying he won't talk about that now. Apparently he's angry when people bring up reptilians cause it's embarrassing because he was like, I shouldn't have believed that. Yeah. What's a fucking fool? Heart will hit. And then he became way more mainstream and then the internet came along and it could be like, hey, you remember that fucking reptilian thing? That's the crazy shit. [inaudible] have an answer for that either. Oh yeah. I was just making that up for whatever, what I was back in the early days of internet or I believed it or like I believe that.

Speaker 1:          00:43          Now I realize how crazy that was. Yeah, you can say that, but not like don't bring it up. Yeah. There's, I mean, look, there's fucking, there's real conspiracy. You know that, um, that story about that journalist that was killed by the Saudis this week. [inaudible] that's real, that he was killed. Yeah. They finally admitted that they killed him. Saudis did. Yeah. They said that they killed him in a fight, which is if you see the guy, he like, fuck, this guy's not fighting anyone. Yeah. Like, and some of the, the crown prince's top people, top security people had been released apparently probably gave him a fucking hundred million dollars and said, go chill on a beach somewhere. Wow. Two was like tied in a car accident this week and I'll quote that. Kill a lot of journalists, man. No, not a journalist. Info wars. Real News. Twitter band after MSM outcry over Hillary satire.

Speaker 1:          01:32          So it was a satire piece. I just found the piece and I was like, there's no way that this is real. They thought it was satire. I don't know who did, but can I just tell you about, about Hillary Clinton, his DNA test proving she's only half lizard person only like she's Jewish. She relates it to, to clear her name. Did you know Elizabeth Warren released that thing that says that she's got actual native American blood but it's literally like one, 100024th fucking million trillion. Wow. She has like the smallest amount of a Ben Shapiro tweeted about that. What he said, Oh fuck Jay. We've tried to find it. Your great, great, great, great, great grandfather. But it was something else, but I forgot what it was. See if we could find it. But I think I'm 1.6% African. I did one of those DNA tests. Yeah. And I'm done. If standards goodbye.

Speaker 1:          02:24          I think I'm at least 10 times more African native American. Wow. Um, that's how ridiculous it is. I might be wrong with these numbers because Jamie and I were trying to work it out and we're both stupid. It's fun. She released that. It's like c instead of going like, oh, I guess I'm not that. She was lying and she was also lied to. Probably her family's like, well, you know we have native enough. So I'm like, oh cool. But that does happen. People do check like Jamie. Jamie thought he had a gang gang of native American in him. He's a chat. Supposedly do. It's hard to prove. It's from what I'm trying to find out. I can't wait to do one of those tests. I just have up to see if I'm over 90% 7% Jewish, like under 97% Jewish. Mine is almost exactly what I thought.

Speaker 1:          03:05          It's mostly Italian. It's some other European like Irish and English. You've got to be part monkey. Yeah. There's some, there's some neanderthal. I found the editorial in there. Yeah. 87% more than the average person. No, he was trying to prove that he was minorities who claim victim hood. I know, I know. To take the cut, they swab your mouth. So of course he found an native American and just doesn't making out with them and then swap and I know like uh, came up kind of weird. They're like 98% native American so we can get a blood test. So of he wasn't any minority except he was like 2% in the end are tall and he goes, oh you white. My people out. You raped by people and that's great. Yeah.
