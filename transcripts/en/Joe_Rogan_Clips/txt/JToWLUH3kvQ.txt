Speaker 1:          00:00          How many, what percentage of people like to be peed on? It's got to be below 1%. That's still a lot. It's 300 million people. That means 3 million people or to get peed on. That's just in this country alone. That's a lot of pee clean up. You know what I mean? I don't even think it's 1%, but even if it's one 10th of 1% is 300,000 people. Like I love a chocolate Sundae, but if you smeared it all over the place, then the after the clean up I probably back. You know, I'm not into that. Yeah. Think what do you, what do you went to? It's a freakish thing you're into. I'm surprisingly tame. I'm not in anything freaky. I've never even done like whip cream or anything. Mm Hace what about when a girl asks you to like choke or a little, how do you feel about that?

Speaker 1:          00:45          Um, that's a scary request. I'm not into that. I'm not. Um, I had a girl that I used to date who, uh, wanted me to rape her. She told me the raper that's, hmm, that's tough and problem. When she was fucking hot and I was like I do not want to get interested in doing this. Like the, the, the worst thing would be you really liked. Yeah cause I was in my twenties. What if, what if I just had it came up then I got into like only girls that want you to like force them to do shit. And that's, that's very true. When you are young and you're forming your sexuality, whatever you first got your like when I first dance with a girl and I noticed her hips were wide. I, I got like a boner and there's like an eighth grade cause it was like this is, she's different link and four years till I was like in my early thirties I could not dance with a girl without getting a hard on.

Speaker 1:          01:41          I was at a wedding once and I asked this girl to dance, I never do this. But she was like alone and she was hot and I got on the dance floor, my mother's there and I got like a boner. I don't know this girl at all. And I had to tell her, cause you know, you know like your wedding pants are not keeping things no. And so full pitched and I, she probably already knew. So I was like, I'm sorry, can you help me off off the floor? And I had to how humiliating it says I'd asked this girl to like Shimmer me off the floor away from my mother. Yeah, she had a good, luckily a good sense of humor about it, but it was luck ameliorating. Well she, well I shouldn't say she should be flattered but a grownup, but sense of humor, if you flattered.

Speaker 1:          02:27          She invited to her Halloween party after that, which is a good sign. But that went bad. I, I got all dressed up as the universe. Like I, I, yeah, I had like a whole black outfit and I glued like planets to my body with velcro and then grown man. And then I go to her house on time, which I didn't realize that you don't go to parties on time. I just gotten to La and then I went and I went to hug her. I knocked over the skeleton on the wall and there were a dog ran up and like bit Venus off my leg and took off and I'm just in the room and no one's dressed up. People are coming and they're like, have a bad day. It's like I'm a pirate, but no one's really dressed up except for a meal. So I was a pariah and then no one taught me, say put the at the end, this guy, because all our friends were like, frat guys.

Speaker 1:          03:13          He goes, can I ask you a question? And I was like, yeah, like I want someone to talk to me. He goes, you a faggot? No, yeah, no. It was like really? Yeah. Was like, now I'm in is all started with me getting a boner with this girl. But anyway, I gotta go and Jesus Christ what a Dick. Yeah, it was kind of a dick. Was he a dick before that? Yeah, they were all kind of like a jockey jockey and they were drunk. And I think I seem like a target cause I had the universe, uh, on my body seemed like an easy target. Yeah. But that's, that's a severe weakness. Unless you were doing something. I mean, why wouldn't they think that was funny? Like what are you doing man? What's with the outfit? And then he started talking and you start laughing. Everybody has a gate.

Speaker 1:          03:56          Yeah, we would have had a good time. Yeah, you went right. Yeah. Yeah. You know that's funny though. The boner thing. Yeah. Cause there was a girl that I dated when I was in high school and she, she was into like rubbing her feet on me and I had a foot thing for a long time because of it. What, where was she rubbing her feet idea? I mean that I meant like where are you at your house, school or whatever. She would just rubber feet on my legs and put her feet on my girlfriend. Yeah. Yeah. I used to go to this math class, 10 30 ugly teacher, but her smell boner every time. And I knew, I was like, ah, I gotta go get a boner in this class. That's hilarious. But that is a real thing about like getting connected to like a particular like thing, like whether it's choking someone or any of that guy.

Speaker 1:          04:54          That girl, the girl wanted me to rape her. Also would grab my hand and put it on the back row, like get me to force her head down. She was crazy. She was just really into it, but it took a while for her to warm up. It's almost like when we first started fooling around, she's like, come on, don't tell him this mother fucker what I like normal. And then one day she wanted to Russell. Okay. Yeah. She's like warm rustic gateway draws like what? She's like when a Russell you I've put on kick your ass. I was like, what the fuck are you talking about? Like what are you doing? You just beat her up. You lost. I didn't, I didn't, I didn't beat her up, but I was trying to figure out what we're doing while we're doing it and she turned it sexual.

Speaker 1:          05:38          She got into it. Yeah. I think like, like Louis C K I like, I remember he's show like one of the first episodes he had a show rogue, an older girl asked him to jerk off in front of her. And I was always like, I bet that actually happened. And that got linked up. You can't really decide what links up your sexuality, what it is a turns on. It just could have, I have no information. But that's my guess. If people are into weird shit man, what are in the weird shit I ended the weirdest is this, is this smelling the shoes. Oh Marla maples trumps x. Put a camera in her bedroom because she kept in her closet cause she kept losing. She did have one shoe and it was some friend would come in, they got the economy just like just coming in and stealing sniffing or she's Christ has zakat linked up.

Speaker 1:          06:27          Ah. Anyway. Yeah, there's a lot of that stuff, right? Like stealing underwear, stealing shoes. Yeah. Men are, the thing is, I mean men get picked on cause we're, we're pervs and that's, it's true. But if we weren't pervs this species wouldn't be, or let me tell you why. Because we were down to like 70,000 people. If we didn't have this super per game to go through the snow, get some pussy I think is less than 70,000 people. They were saying that after one of the super volcanoes it might've gotten down to is it's just a few thousand ma. Well, there's a definite, what does it Sumatra? Is that where it was? Indonesia? Some, some massive supervolcano 70,000 years ago. Killed off almost everybody. Oh, I didn't know about that. We got down to extremely low number. I think they estimate it's somewhere between like two and maybe like 10,000 people.

Speaker 1:          07:23          Yeah. You need people who liked off bug a lot that are real curvy, curvy, jump that up. Well, you know, Bret Weinstein, who is a, yeah, he was a professor. Sorry. What's going on man? I smoked weed before the show. I'm not going to lie to people. Um, he, um, was explaining with his wife who's also a biologist, that there's two different things that men are attracted to. They're attracted to a beautiful woman, but they're attracted to a hot woman. Like a hot woman doesn't necessarily have to be beautiful, but what she does is offer an opportunity for like very quick sex. Like you could just have sex with her. You don't have to court her like a girl with a short skirt and her tits are popping out and she's wearing a lot of makeup that what that signals is that there's an opportunity for you to spread your genes and you have no responsibility.

Speaker 1:          08:14          You wouldn't have to take care of it. You wouldn't have to, you wouldn't have to spend a lot of time with her court her that she was, she's the type of person that allows you to just fuck her. You can move on and spread your genes elsewhere. That makes sense. Yeah, that there's a like an evolutionary reason for that being a stimulating thing for men. Like for men, like this idea of like these loose women like loose women are very attracted, very attractive to us for that reason. It's not just that like, oh yeah, if I get some not deal with all these bitches in there. No. It's literally an evolutionary trait that we have adapted to the disease thing. Knocks it back a little bit for me. I'll go like, oh my big disease there is, I have anecdote, anecdote and antidote for cause I don't feel like there's any woman who could, no matter how hot like come and and and, and uh, take me away or like a force me to like, what am I trying to say?

Speaker 1:          09:10          Seduced me. Why you're here. It is, I think a woman could seduce you now if I don't want her to. I have an anecdote, anecdote I haven't handed out and it's, I've been developing it over years and people can uh, listening can take this if you like, let's say you fell for somebody and she didn't like, and she jumped you and you're still pining over her. Put her first. You'd like think about like the blood moving through her body and her and her skeleton and you put her on the toilet. You think about like she's making by, I know it's gross, but that's, you think about her as this animal and you think about her on the toilet and you, whenever she pops up, you put her on the toilet. You're welcome. That doesn't work with me. It will. I won't care. No, no, no. If I think she's hot, but she's really struggling on the toilet, I struggle on the toilet so you can bond over that.

Speaker 1:          10:03          I take, I eat a lot, man. I'd take some horrific shits. But think about like the Bachelorette or something. They're there. Fantasize a lot of times early on there's like this fantasy and, and uh, you know your, your marriage. Yes. So you're, you have, there's intimacy and you get past all that, but that early on fantasy make filling in the blanks as perfect person. You usually leave that out. It never bothered me. I don't, I don't give a fuck about periods. What about, I'm thinking about their skeleton, anything? Does that kind of go oh yeah, yeah. If you just imagine there's a skeleton underneath this woman that I'm like pining over. She's just like, all right, this doesn't work. It doesn't work on me. It works for me to tell you, man, if I think someone's hot, I think they're hot. I don't care if they just took a diary of Shit. How about this? I imagine they have bad breath. I'll be like, God, but she has bad breath and I'd tell her.
