Speaker 1:          00:00          Well you can say people of color, the same words just twisted around dude, I had a um, it's messed up. It's like you can just be like labeled a racist or sexist or whatever for like saying like the Oh yeah, yeah, it's wild. Um, I had 23 and me DNA tests done and the lows, they're pretty good and I was hoping if I was, if I was more than 10% black, I was going to start dropping n bombs, but a 1.6, so 1.6 1.6% African pretty strong. It's all Dick. And I thought, well when they did that thing about Elizabeth Warren or I did find out what percentage she is, uh, Elizabeth Warren who claim to be native American and she did a test, she's like one, one, 100th of what I am. Like, it's literally like her saying she's, yeah, her saying she's and a native American is literally like me saying I'm African American, but I have more of a claim. I have far more like more than I think some some insane number, like a factor of more African in me that she has native American and I'm not even remotely native Americans are not remotely African rather. Yeah, I'm 1.6% I have 1.6% African in me and she has like some fucking really stupid number. What is the dumb, it's like 0.01 I don't even know how to make sense of all that stuff

Speaker 2:          01:36          she had. That was how it happened was a Harvard researcher looked into it and gave a number that was very vague. That would be like one and 512th two one and 1020 fourth

Speaker 1:          01:50          something like that. That sucks dude. It's so crazy socks. That's the thing like something I Google, it gives a shit, but she got into Harvard because of this, which she claimed she was native American when she got in. That was claiming that she was a minor one was Harvard, right? Correct. I'm being honest with that. What was it? Cambridge, whatever. The university is showing him some university by claiming that she was native American, so she got a special scholarship because of that. The whole man literally lasted like me going to Morehouse and saying, I'm African American, except I have a far better claim. You have a much higher percentage, much higher.

Speaker 1:          02:31          That's so crazy. Wild. Meanwhile, she's so nuts like because Trump was always calling her Pocahontas and Trump said that of shit. How is it that you can't, if you said the wrong thing on your podcasts, people will be up in arms, but it's unreasoned. The president can say whatever the hell he wants to say. He's making fun of her shit ever tending to be a native American. He was joking about heart. She's not really native American and he called her Pocahontas and he said if she took a DNA test and showed that she was native American, he would donate $1 million to a charity of her choice. So she, after this fucking test that basically showed she has these smallest measurable possibility, native American in her was requiring him to pay.

Speaker 1:          03:16          You should pay Harvard for what? You fucking the money back built from them. Where at school that she go to trying to find the actual thing it seems, I think she actually got a job at Harvard. Not, didn't go there for your education. Oh, she got a job there and because of trying to find out, okay, we'll figure it out. But that's hilarious. I the I the idea that that is something you can lean on is so god damn crazy. Listen, you're a white lady. I'm a white guy. Shut the fuck up. Okay. You're not, there's no, there's not a part of you that has been discriminated against because of the fact that you're native American. It just doesn't exist. It's not true. It's just us. So fascinating to me. Oh, people love to be a victim. They'd love to say, you know, it was my life growing up was hard because I'm one 150000th native American busy.

Speaker 1:          04:11          Crazy. And where does it stop? Like is it, is it, is it, is it cool to say that if you're 2% or 10% or 50% like where is it? Where is it? That's what I'm saying. At 1.6% I really don't feel like it could drop n bombs. Right? 10 it's not 10% like I'm mostly Italian. I'm like three quarters Italian so I can call someone a Guinea Guinea, no problem. But get the times, don't give a fuck if you call them guineas. Yeah. Like, okay. Like just know Bailey is no good slurs for Italians work. You know, they've successfully integrated into society. But when my grandfather used to tell me about, he came over here when he was a boy from Italy and he would tell me about how bad it was about how much they were discriminated against. You know, I'm just, it was, it was hardcore.

Speaker 1:          04:59          I mean they were treated a lot of the same way. Racist People Treat Mexicans today. And Irish, same thing. Same thing. Yeah. Yeah. And that's, my background is Italian and Irish mostly, but someone got fucked by a black person somewhere, somewhere. 1.6% I don't know how many generations there. I guess the claim is that she used her claim that she's native American to get a job. Yes. Not, not to get it out to go into school, get a job at Harvard, at one at Harvard, one at Pennsylvania. So she did it twice. Give that money back, bitch. I love the DNA test though. I love the DNA test. It just proves it. We're all like something. We're all a bunch of shit like, yeah. You know what I mean? I'm like 30 things.
