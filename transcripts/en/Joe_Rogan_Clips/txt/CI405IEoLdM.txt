Speaker 1:          00:00          Are applying. I mean even just yesterday, I think some journalists got banned from Facebook. Where the store, yeah. Let me, I'm going to send this to you Jamie, cause it's a really crazy one because they wanted her to show who her funding sources were and I didn't even know that there was an area where you could show that. So it's almost like they're making this up as they go along. Yeah. Kyle Kalinsky sent me this today. I want to send this to you right now. Jamie. Hang on one second.

Speaker 1:          00:33          Hold on. I'm very quiet. Unfortunately. This is an audio show. Live there. Yes. Not Dead Air. There you go. Okay Buddy. I just send it to you. Okay. Uh, Facebook suspended in the now tweets, uh, page at the behest of CNN and the u s government funded think tanks. Says we had almost 4 million subscribers, did not violate Facebook rules were given no warning and Facebook isn't responding to us. So yeah. What is, what was the, what it would actually started this off. I mean, who knows? They don't communicate with anyone. They'd been banning legit accounts for years. They, you cannot even send a minds.com the link through Facebook messenger right now. Blocked. What? Yeah. Why's. If you post in the newsfeed, it says careful, this could be an unsecure website. Oh, just clicked on a link from TMZ yesterday and got the same thing from on Twitter.

Speaker 1:          01:34          Twitter. I said this might be malicious. They're spam. They're could be from minds. No, that's from Tia. TMZ Link. It was clicking this like this story is on Tmz here to see the, the rest of the story. So they're trying to keep you from going to TMZ. Yeah. I don't know why it was the first time I've ever seen that, eh, it's probably caught up in some algorithm and I sent an actual written letter to Facebook about it. Obviously I don't get back. And then there's no human written letter. He wrote it with a piece of paper known now that would have been cool. I sign it with ink. But really we had no, cause our lawyer said to, you know, that actually proves that you sent them something, some sort of diligence, but there's, there's just no recourse. It's their lost. So explain. So if someone is trying to say on Facebook messenger, hey, you should go check out minds.com they won't let you post that link. Nope. And what is their excuse? They don't tell you. No, don't. So is it because you're competing social media network? I don't know. I don't want to get into, I don't know. You don't know? I'm not going to say no. It does. Yeah. Yeah. You don't know why it does, but you know, it doesn't, they're calling us unsecure and I'm pretty sure that Facebook got hacked. You know, they compromise everybody's data. Like do you want to talk about unsecure? There's no more unsecure site that exists.

Speaker 1:          02:56          It is kind of funny, right? I mean after those and after all the, uh, the Russia stuff, yeah. It's um, it is kind of funny calling somebody else on secure. Yeah. They're insecure. Mark Zuckerberg is very insecure. Well, he's also stupid rich. He, um, he seems like he's too rich. Like he fucked up. Like he's there sipping water, like a robot trying to figure out what the fuck he's doing with this life. I think that they're scared because they know they've betrayed everybody and so it's hard to get them to, to speak. You know, it's interesting with, with Dorsey here because I, you know, give him credit for speaking, but the fact is that he's not answering the question well, he's bringing someone else in to answer the questions in the next go round. And so that should be very interesting. He actually didn't know the answer to those questions.

Speaker 1:          03:44          I think he probably doesn't know all the specifics because he's a CEO of not one, but two different corporations. He's busy shit. And also we're but true. But I think that when we look at the policy that exists on these networks, like he is in control of the policy to large degree. There's a board, I don't know if there's a decision making process, but he has a large voice. I don't know how large his voices, I assume that's probably true. But one of the things we did detail on the last podcast with Tim Pool was how he wasn't the CEO for quite a long time fired and then rehired at that point. Yeah. So, um, obviously there's some contention, there are some issues and you know, there's a, it's a lot of money involved in these things and I think that plays a giant part and how they decide to make decisions.

Speaker 1:          04:29          And, but do you think that an advertiser in reality doesn't like, say you're an advertiser and you want to advertise your computer. Okay. And there's a video on youtube that is about something controversial. Does it actually make sense for that advertiser to not show their product on that controversial video? Don't they want to sell computers? Uh, well it depends. I mean, if the controversial videos are about how Jews are evil and you have this video about Jews being evil and then you know, like by Razer computers come on tucked on at the right. But do you think that people actually, I can understand not wanting to support certain types of content and maybe advertisers feel like they're supporting that content by advertising next to it. But I also don't think that people, when they're watching a controversial video on the Internet say, oh my gosh, you know, this advertiser is completely out of line for being next to this controversial thing.

Speaker 1:          05:30          I, I don't think that's a, a healthy direction to move. Well, okay, that's one way to look at it. Another way to look at it is if you are a giant company that sells things, let's say you're Toyota and you're selling Tundras, you don't want your Tundras to be associated in any way with something that you might think is negative. It's their prerogative. If they're paying for advertising, they can kind of decide. This is one of the things that's leading, um, youtube and specific, and I've had a ton of conversations about this there. It's leading them specifically to try to de monetize things that could be considered distasteful or insensitive or controversial. And it's very frustrating to content creators when you talk to them. They're essentially saying that they need to do better and that their tools are very blunt, that they don't really have the correct computer learning tools to figure out what is offensive and why.

Speaker 1:          06:26          And then there's a human review system, which is very weird. And we've run into that many times where like, we'll have like a podcast with like say Tom Papa, who's an uncontroversial fantastic standup comedian. And it's like demonetized and then we're like, why? What happened? And then we go, what the fuck can we talk about? We didn't talk about anything crazy. And it's really damaging for brands when it gets demonetize right away. Cause it's that initial time period that generates the most revenue. Yeah. Said when you have to go back and do it. I mean, so I agree with that, but, so we built a tool that's like a peer to peer advertising tool. So it's not, there's two options. You can, so you earn crypto for your contributions and then which Cryptos do you support? We have an ethereum based token, but we're going to support all of them.

Speaker 1:          07:12          So what does a theory on base token? So it's an Erc 20 token. What does that mean? It means that we basically reward people for all of their activities. Okay. So like say if Jamie's posted on mines and uh, people love his posts, he gets rewarded in some, yeah. How much? How much again? Well, can I go buy one token will give you a thousand impressions. Oh, so you, it, we're not focused on like, oh, you're going to make money from this. Wait. [inaudible] we're saying one token will give you a thousand impressions or you get a thousand impressions from, you get a token from 1000 impressions. One, when you use a token to advertise on mines, Oh, you get a thousand impressions when you boost your posts with it. So if you use the Crypto, you use a token, you guarantee views. Yeah. That's weird. And it, why? Well, you're guaranteeing people see something. Well, we, when you boosted, it gets fed to people's news feed chronologically, right? I say so there's just a backlog. So sort of like when Instagram has a sponsored posts, except we're not spying on people to, when we send them Instagram Spaz on people to mine. Yeah. I don't know, man. I'm stupid. Help me out. It's.
