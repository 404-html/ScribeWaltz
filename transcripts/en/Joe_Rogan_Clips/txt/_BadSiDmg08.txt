Speaker 1:          00:00          What kind of medication do you have to take if you're going to go there? Because you have to take some anti-malarial stuff, right? I'm a pin cushion. Like I had so many shots and pills and you know, like the preventative, obviously I actually don't do malaria medication. I just cover up. Um, because it messes with your brain. I don't know if you know that. Like I, they say the new modern ones aren't bad, but the malarone like you have hallucinations at night, you have crazy sweats like, especially if you're in hot sun. So I, I would rather be more focused, especially if I'm working with reptiles or stuff like that, that can, you know, [inaudible] me. So I try and try to stay away from it and just cover up. Wow. Is there a specific type of clothing that's like anti mosquito repellent clothing or anything like that?

Speaker 1:          00:43          I just do long sleeves and some bug spray. And do you do a mask as well now? No. That's silliness. Really look silly. It does look, so, no, I just do, you know, good old deet. God. That's stuff's gotta be bad for you too though. It melts you like if you get it on like say these things, it will melt the painting, the paint off of the headphones. It's so strong. It's probably worse than the mouth. Have you ever used a thermostat? What did they call the m fucking is it called Thermacell? I think that's was called. Um, it's um, it's a device that heats up. It's got like an element inside of it and like a little bit, a little canister of gasoline and you put these sheets and it releases this very fine mist. Oh No. Kind of smell and mosquitoes fucking hate it.

Speaker 1:          01:27          No Way. Yeah, we used it in Alberta. Alberta has very aggressive mosquitoes when they're out, when they're out, they're out. It's like clouds of them, right? Yeah. Cause some of your life for like three months. Right? It's like Alaska. There've been a last night. It's the worst. Mosquitoes have ever seen. Crazy like pick you up. Yeah. They're like, there's size of pigeons and their funnel everywhere. Totally. And when a fishing with my friend Ari and we pulled up the, the, the car and we'd got out of the car and we opened the car door and within seconds a swarm of mosquitoes was inside the car. It's insane. We were screaming like, what the fuck? This is crazy. And it's like something out of, it's a Stephen King movie. There's clouds and they, I, I, yeah, that's why you asked me what I'm scared of it. That fucking clouds of mosquitoes, man. Well, we're very fortunate we don't have malaria here in the United States. Yup. Absolutely. If it made its way over here somehow, you know, I, um, I wear this fabric. You're talking about Thermacell called hex.

Speaker 1:          02:22          Hex. Exactly. And, um, I wear for a lot of reasons because I definitely feel it helps me get closer to wildlife, but I've noticed mosquitoes do not like it real. So that's, that's what a heck suit is for, for people that don't know what we're talking about. So it's this interwoven carbon grid that actually holds the body's electrical energy and capacity, like the door of microwave oven, like a faraday cage. Right. And so you naturally admit electrical energy and then when you wear this clothing, it's got this conductive carbon grid. And when you touch the ground or something at grounds it and releases all the energy. So birds migrate or using. Yeah, there you go. Now has it had been proven that this stuff actually work? I mean it has been proven that it has an effect on the electrical energy that you released, but has it been proven that the animals can actually recognize that electrical energy and with certain animals?

Speaker 1:          03:08          Yes. So we know that electro reception is certain wildlife's capable out of birds use it to migrate. Sea Turtles Use magnetic poles to migrate. Um, they just discovered, I believe 2014 that lobsters antenna have electrical detective sensors or electro reception is the word. Um, so it's proven on some things, not everything. You know, our understanding of animal behavior and animal adept till ability is constantly growing. So it's passive, you know what I mean? I wear it because it's a passive technology. It's like I'm going to wear a shirt anyway. Why not wear one that might or might not help? So I feel it helps my friend John Dudley is a bow hunter. Yup. Pretty famous bow hunting. I know John. Yeah. Okay. And He, and he swears by it. Yeah. Yeah. He wears them constantly. He's like, it makes a big difference. I think. So, you know, like I'm, I'm not hunting, I'm just trying to get close to stuff and interact with it or find something.

Speaker 1:          04:00          But I feel it makes a difference. Notice a difference personally, especially with birds. Um, I've noticed a huge difference. I've noticed a huge difference in the water. Some mammals I've noticed a difference. Um, but yeah, I like John. I feel like it's, it helps me get closer and you know, keeps, keeps the energy down. Do you know what I mean? Like you're admitting all this energy, you see this bear or whatever it is, your heart's spikes, your adrenaline goes and it keeps that in capacity. So I think we sense that. I think certain creatures sense that. And I, I like to keep that out of the equation. Right. The, I guess it would be that there is something coming off of your body and it probably would be an advantage for animals to be able to recognize that just because we can't quantify it, right. And put it on a scale and weigh out or something like that. It's probably something going on Predator prey, right? Like if you're aligned and I'm an, I'm an antelope and, uh, my adrenaline spikes and my heart's going and you know, you're going to come for me, right? But if that's out of the equation, the energy stays reduced.
