Speaker 1:          00:00          The argument on the other side is when people are distributing, and I'm going to use the big air quotes, hate speech, that's when it gets slippery to me because who's to decide what's hate speech and what's not? Hate speech. I mean, I've seen people make some ridiculous fucking statements about all sorts of people that are inaccurate and they do that in order to categorize them and pigeonhole them in, in an easily definable and dismissible co, uh, characterization. You know, you just decide, hey, that Bill Ottman guy, that guy's a this. Oh, he's a radical that and he believes in this, so fuck him. And they're like, okay, fuck him, sweep more. I, and then cancel culture comes in like, we're going to cancel Bill Ottman. We're not listening to him anymore. You know, he lied to us about his source or whatever the fuck you doing. Have you heard of Daryl Davis?

Speaker 1:          00:45          No, I have not. Once I forgot Dow. David's your boy. He's my boy. He, he, you'll, you'll, I haven't met him, but he's, he's my way. I want him to be my boy. So he is a black man who befriended hundreds of members of the KKK and he got them all to leave. He got them to leave the to 200 members. Wow. After he was like, yeah, I'm just going to talk to you. Really he would you ever see the n a w Kamau Bell's a show when he visited with those white supremacists? Not that specific one. Yeah, it was. It's really good because he's such a nice guy. He's so like easy to get along with that. They were like sort of, they let the guard down around them and you know, you get to see these people kind of confused that they liked this guy.

Speaker 1:          01:32          You know? That's why I think initiating human contact via the social networks, like that's really important. But to play devil's advocate, it's one of the worst ways for people to express themselves in a way where you consider other human beings experiences and feelings and the way they're going to receive what you're saying because there's no social cues. You're not interacting with them, you're not looking at them in the eyes. It's one of the weirder forms of communication between human beings and one that I would argue we have not really necessarily a successfully navigated it yet. I agree. I was actually saying that I think we should use social media more to get people to get together in real life. Do you know who uh, Megan Phelps is? No. She, uh, was uh, with the Westboro Baptist Church. Uh, you know, the, the, the famous one that the protests, those soldier's funerals and you know, and, and anything gay and they're like ruthlessly viciously fundamental Christians where, you know, they do a lot of protesting at funerals and to a lot of stuff to try to get, she was with them for, for the longest time and then got on Twitter and through communicating on Twitter when you meet her, you would never believe it in a million years that she was ever this fundamentalist and that she was ever some mean person sending hateful messages to people because their son was gay or whatever it was.

Speaker 1:          03:00          Now she's completely cured of it. She's has no contact with the church anymore. She's married, has a kid, she's completely outside of it. She does podcasts now and give Ted talks and speaks about radicalization and about how she was kind of indoctrinated in, grew up in this family and her, her grandfather, Fred Phelps was this, you know, he's like, it's a fucking mean guy. Like a really mean v. He's the God hates fags guy. You know, they would have those signs that they would hold up. But at the soldier's funerals, I mean, he's like really inflammatory stuff. But through Twitter, through her communicating with people on Twitter and specifically her now husband, like he, he cured her like it just with rational discourse and communication and she was old will change. They will change. And so that's why banning them. I mean, I saw on a recent podcast you've been talking about redemption.

Speaker 1:          03:54          Yeah. So, but I'm curious, what do you think people, what is, how does that look like? Well, timber, it, look, in the case of like Megan Phelps, that's a real thing, right? She really did change. Um, another example is Christian peak Illini. Do you know who he is? He was a white supremacists KKK member guy who's been on Sam Harris's podcast. He's also done some Ted talks who now speaks out against it and talks about how he's indoctrinated and talks about how lost he was. Now he was brought into this ideology. Um, there are, there's many people like that all over the world. Um, uh, Majid Majid was another perfect example. He was an Islamist, I mean, he was, you know, trying to form a caliphate was literally thinking about radical Islamic terrorism as being some sort of a solution. Now he's the opposite. Now he's trying to get people to leave and he's trying to get people to be more reasonable and secular or see what happened to him.

Speaker 1:          04:54          He ain't got punched in the street. Yeah. Um, yeah. Some guy called him a fucking packy I guess, and punched him in the head and fucked his head up and he's got this giant cotton in his head from a ring and his face is swollen up. But apparently they have the guy on video and um, you know, they think they're going to be able to arrest the guy. I've had magic on the show. He's a super nice guy. The, the hard thing is that all right. Yes, we see these transformations take place. It makes us feel warm inside and yes, people, people can change, but at the same time, what are people have, should people have to go apologize to Twitter? Oh, I'm sorry. Like can I come back? Right. I mean that's not like sometimes people are going to think completely differently than you and you just have to deal with it.

Speaker 1:          05:36          And that should be okay. We shouldn't force people to come in to our way of thinking in order to have discourse. No, that's a good point. That's a very good point. Um, and like who is to decide what this path to redemption is and whether or not you've completed it, right? Who was decided like maybe you are a, a hyper radical lefty and maybe Jamie's points of view and yours are just never going to line up. So you're like, fuck him. He's banned for life, which a lot of people have been banned for life. And when you look at some of the infractions, they'd been banned for it. They're like, boy, I don't know about that one. That doesn't really make sense. Almost none of the high pro profile banning cases make much sense. It's like a short term solution that's creating a longterm problem. Yeah, that's really what it is. So I just think that we have to talk about it more. I don't know. I, it's like why can't we just get everyone to talk about it? Yeah. I get the same time. I mean it's like we're just wasting time here. Well, sort of, but I also think we're figuring it out as we go along with a bunch of different competing ideologies. Um, you know, you have yours, which like you dude, you look like a hacker. Unlike House of cards, you'll look like a guy you call in

Speaker 2:          06:55          to break into the, the, the mainframe server. Not that honestly, I believe you're not, I hang out on to get lab in checkout code, but I did. I cannot code. I cannot coach bad claim. I'm not claiming to be a developer. No, these people are, I know there's another level. It is incredible. I understand,

Speaker 1:          07:14          right? Yeah. I get it. Well that's like if someone says to me like, you're an MMA fighter, I'm like, I'm definitely not. They are another fucking level. Like there's a different like, yeah, I know a little martial arts, but just, just settle the fuck down. Right. Same kind of thing. I think though that you, your ideology is going to be your, your point of view and perspective is going to be very different than maybe someone who's like a radical Marxist, you know, it shouldn't they be allowed to post on the site to someone who's like an extreme socialist. Someone like a AOC. You know, someone, someone who thinks that we should give money to people who are unwilling to work, someone who thinks that we should try to engineer society and tax the top x percent, you know, 70 something percent of their income. There's a lot of those different people and we have to figure out how to, to make it so that, well, we have to figure out a way to make it so all the ideas can compete in the marketplace of ideas. Right. All these different ideas can compete and we can find out which one is better and we could find out which one is better. Yeah. You don't always find out which one is better though. Right. You find out which one is most people. I mean, that's what happened with Hitler, right? Well, you don't really find out what's better. You find out what, what's got more juice behind it.
