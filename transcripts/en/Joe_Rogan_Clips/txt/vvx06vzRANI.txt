Speaker 1:          00:00          My brother in law had a metal plate put in his shoulder because his collar bone was shattered in a motorcycle accident. Was going to say it's either like motorcycles or skiing or like any, any anything where you're going over 30 miles an hour slam. That's the only way to break a collar bomb. There's no other way to fake collarbone. Yeah, cause he's, cause he's got it drawn. Get hit by a car or motorcycle crash. It's like why I'm saying, oh he wiped out. Wiped out. Dude. I saw a guy get hit the other day and it made my, made my heart hurt for the cake. Yeah, he got smoked. I watched it. I watched it happen. He was key, was going left her in their section and a guy ran the yellow, but he was really running a red, it was red, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:36          And, and he slammed on the brakes and the car turned a little bit and the bike and he tried to like jerk the bike as hard as he could, but boom. And it made my heart he was alive, but I was just like, oh, probably broken. Oh, he was, oh dude, he couldn't, he didn't move. I mean, fuck yeah. Motorcycles are so scary. The shit out of me, man. Red Light this morning and the light turned green and some dude just whizzed in between me and some guy who is about to change lanes. So like I'm in this lane and I'm driving straight and this guy was about to change lanes. This guy went and I went oh inches away. I almost saw death. I also saw a guy get killed and that happens all day every day in la because they're allowed to cut lanes. But here's the thing, they assume risk.

Speaker 1:          01:21          Yeah. Yup. They assume all the worrying, that thing where you're cutting lanes and a guy turns into you and kills you. It's their fault. It's on you. Yup. It's crazy. Like in Chicago, do you can't split lanes in Illinois. You're not allowed to, but didn't appeal, but there's no helmet law. I seen that to me is like, man, this shit's all these fucking guys on Harleys. Fuck yeah. Fucking helmets or feed up on the the things not wearing a helmet. I'm not some fun knowing, not some faggy did push the skin a head trauma. They should just all be forced to look at Gary Busey before and after. You don't want to wear a fucking element. Did him and I know you know he hit a curb with his skull. Dude. The fact that he's alive is insane. Oh, the doctors, doctors this shit. I just smothering him with a pillow.

Speaker 1:          02:08          You're good. We're going to take you out. Dude. Pulled bastard. I was watching some thing the other day with him. Joe Really recently talking and I was like, Whoa, it's right to be here on Rogan. Joe fucking love you man. He's fucking breakable of having like normal talk. It's all like theatrical and animated because I think years of, I think years of of acting and stuff late in his brain and now that he's got kind, Kinda like he's off the edge. I think he feels like he has to be a caricature to like feel normal. You know what I mean? I think he's the way he masks the serious brain trauma and pain, whatever pain is really going on. I think that's it. Maybe it's fine. Maybe a meet him and he's like, Hey, I'm playing it up. This is what I got. He said, what do you mean this is a bit, it's my thing.

Speaker 1:          02:54          He's outside smoking a cigarette. He goes, what are you guys talking about? It's a fucking bit chill. It's just me doing fucking try and make a living. Just making money, man. I'm trying to feel my fucking family away cause fuck is wrong with you. So I got one eye is like two inches higher than the other one. That's what he's got now. It's above his eyebrow. It's like where eyebrow it should be. It's like way up here. Well he's, Oh got caved in. I mean, and it was not funny to laugh at it, but my God, it just, he just looks, when you see him when he's young, you know, he's kind of like a normal looking dude and like, okay look and dude and the, now you're like Jesus Christ and he's just all squirrely now. But if you go back to him and like lethal weapon, he was a bad motherfucker. Look, look at his left eye's like down. It's like shifted. Something's wrong. Yeah. But when he was young, like the lethal weapon, like when he played Mr Joshua. Yeah. Fucking wicked. I was awesome. I go to that one picture with the two heads scroll. Scroll down please. None of these are Photoshop. Go to that one picture with the green lettering.

Speaker 1:          03:53          Photoshop. Oh yeah. Don't go to that. So a lot of these hearings after rude, that's just being rude. Being an ass about the one on the right hand side with the suit. The suit on Deloitte below that with a suit. The actual suit. That's a real photo player. Just being silly. Well this was back when helmet laws didn't exist. Yeah, no helmet law. You could ride around La with no helmet if they should all be. I mean, even if they're within the law, why wouldn't you want to mean fuck me? I, I get that. It's probably wait, I don't listen to all the community is like, you don't get it. Yeah Bro. You don't understand. Freedom. I like my fucking brain Caribou. Me? Yeah. I like my, I like my brain. Sorry man. I don't like, you know, but there's a lot of states, Arizona's and other one you see people with no hell no helmet law.

Speaker 1:          04:38          Yeah, no helmet. Texas. I think Vegas he allowed to have in Nevada. I mean I've seen plenty of guys on bikes without one, but I can't tell you who, what cop would pull you over. You know what I mean? It's kind of like in Vegas. What do they do? The last thing on their fucking mind are supposed to, in Vegas you are look up just Google states without helmet laws and see how many there are. Colorado. I know you don't have to have one. Definitely seen people. Wild country man. That's, they don't give a fuck. Nope. It's square state square style. Perfectly Square man in 19 states that require it. Wow. And three one, there is no motorcycle helmet. You Slot in three states, Illinois, Iowa, New Hampshire. But says currently 19 states and DC have laws requiring all writers. So that's what the all writers, both 19 states, all riders.

Speaker 1:          05:20          Yeah. But three states have no laws. Yeah, yeah, Illinois. But what, but some states, wait a minute, it's only three states where you can wear no helmet. What of those states? Illinois, Iowa and New Hampshire. But in Chicago or Colorado, maybe it's, maybe it's maybe the law. It's new. Yeah. Wait a minute. Is it just Google helmet laws in Colorado? Motorcycle. I've seen people ride motorcycles in Colorado with no helmet. The helmets are proven to save lives and Colorado. However, if the motorcycle operator passengers are under 18 they must wear a helmet. Passengers, yeah, that same passenger law, but that's under 18 under 18 if they're over 18 they can do whatever the fuck they want. Is that what it says? What it says. So there isn't a helmet law. You just, if you're, if you're 18 or if you're 16 they have helmet laws. So what you're saying is three states have no helmet laws.

Speaker 1:          06:18          That means under 18 over eight doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Right. But some states have laws, but grown ass adults can decide to go suicide, but they won't style. And yeah, that's where it is. Yeah. That's fucking crazy weird. The people that fight for that, they don't, but that's like saying no seatbelt law. That's the crazy thing. What do you don't? You don't want to wear it, but here's the thing, like how is it okay to ride a motorcycle ever? And I have to have a seatbelt on. Yeah. Like I'm inside a metal cage. Yes. Motherfuckers that 3,500 pound cake, a steering wheel, and this motherfuckers just got handlebars. He'd go fly him ad. I'll get that shit. I don't know why you wouldn't want to fucking wear helmet. There's no, there's nothing to hold you on. You're fucked. You get clipped. You're done.
