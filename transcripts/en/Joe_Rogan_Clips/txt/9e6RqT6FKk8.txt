Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. I love Oprah. Don't get me wrong. I think she's a wonderful woman. I think she's a powerful force of good and positive energy, which ain't no Eli, but she also brought us doctor Oz and the secret we have to remember with this lady has done, she has to be held accountable. I forgive her, but I mean cut the shit. The secret is a particularly egregious offense. What you don't, you just, Oh, you don't believe, don't believe who believe. I want to be rich. I just am rich. I imagine myself flying. I can fly. I will beat my wings until I take off what's up. Yeah, it was one of the more confused, I want us to be disturbing, but it was confusing when that was taking hold with people. When I had friends that were telling me that the secret is real and that they imagine they were going to fulfill these childhood dreams that they had had about whatever, being a fucking astronaut, whatever, whatever it would be.

Speaker 1:          01:09          There's a couple people that I knew. They were trying to tell me that the secret was going to be the thing and that they had a vision board and they had photographs. They put pictures up of the things that they want to like them in front of large crowds and shit. And I'm like, Oh boy, this is large crowds. It's just so not how it works. Yeah. But there is a kernel of it that works. Yup. Cause it was thinking you wanting something, you envisioning it, but that's a little component and just how you live your life. It's not just sitting in your, you know what it's like and wishing it. So it's like saying I am going to be a bodybuilder because I drink water. Yeah. It's like no, you okay. Geez. Where do I start? You, you should drink water and it will help you if you want to be a bodybuilder.

Speaker 1:          02:00          But I've talked to all these bodybuilders and the one thing they have in common is they all drank water and they knew that if they drank water, they would be giant. There'd be giant, huge people. It's all you've got to go. Okay. But did they also perform reps to failure? Did they also take steroids? Did they also do these exercises? Squats, dead lifts, curls, you know, did they do all that stuff too? Yes, but that but the water, why aren't you a believer? This is what it's like cause cause they're saying like no, these people, they believe that they can do these things. They they, they had this vision and they focus on this vision and it came to fruition. Yeah. You know what they also did? They also busted their fucking ass and got lucky and we're in a business or career that they had some talent in and figured out what that career is and figured out how to navigate the very weird waters of social interaction and skill acquisition and success and failure and learn from your failure and luck.

Speaker 1:          03:01          Yeah. That's the big problem is you're dealing with complete. Yeah. At sampling bias, you're, you're only asking people that are in the mansions. Tom Papa, how did you do it? I mean I see you here. You have this place. It's as big as the White House. You have a giant lawn. Did Judge Joe always know this was going to be your reality. I saw it and I just put it on my vision board and the obviously it doesn't stick around. It'd be didn't it became a fad because all these people, well at some point that's take the board down. Fortunately some people died because they, um, there was a story I was reading about Oprah unfortunately where this woman had terminal cancer and she, she had stage three breast cancer and just decided that through the secret she was going to imagine herself a healthy person and you know, she eventually want them dying from it because she, she didn't get treatment.

Speaker 1:          03:57          The IAA, I mean she, she stopped that she stopped conventional medical training. But what part of, so how far do you go with positive thinking? Cause I see you as a fella that, uh, has goals and I would think positive thinking plays into your life. What does that even mean? Really? Like do I think pauses? I, I, I think in a positive way. I try to be positive. I try, but when you're trying to accomplish something, whether you're trying to, you know, get better at something, like say if you're playing a game, like what if you like golf, like say take up golf and you want to be a really good golfer. Like you start thinking about golf, like how do I get better at golf? You have to learn, you have to pay attention to a instructional videos. You have to maybe seek out coaching, you have to play some games and lose, you have to choke under pressure.

Speaker 1:          04:57          You have to examine the mental game. Like what is wrong with my mental process when I approach a shot? What is wrong with this? What is wrong with it? And then become obsessed with the, the idea of succeeding in that. And I think that that can apply to everything. So yeah, I mean I certainly believe in positive thinking, but that was like mystic nonsense. No, that tips over and it discounts all the other stuff that you have to do something to the law of attraction. It is, but it is one component to this gigantic sort of spectrum of factors that have to be taken into consideration when you're trying to succeed at something. Yeah. Positive thinking is one of them, but it's also the understanding of how to eliminate laziness, how to discipline yourself, how to write down goals, how to, how to make incremental steps towards improvement, how to recognize failure is not just the end of all your hard, but in fact the beginning of a new breakthrough because you understand like how to never do this wrong, wrong the wrong way again.

Speaker 1:          06:04          Yeah, and the consequences of doing things wrong. It's like there's a lot of a lot of factors in getting better and succeeding at things. Yeah, and it's, they boiled it down to the easiest one, which is dreaming. Right, right. Exactly. Exactly. Just, just that's why it's sold, but oversold it. I mean, she was, yeah, she was one of the big ones, man. And she was in, she was fucking 50 years old at the time. I mean, this is not a young woman who was selling this. How old is open now? 75 89 no, she just ran a marathon in four hours. Did she? Really? 67 63 so she ran a marathon. Yeah. So let's, let's think of when the secret came out. I want to say that was like 2006 ish. 2004 2006 okay, so 12 years ago she was, so she was 50 years old.

Speaker 1:          06:57          How the fuck did you not know when you're 50 years old and worth $1 billion that that's not how it works. But it's Hocus pocus. Yeah. It's not hocus pocus. Yeah, and to sell that to people is crazy. And that's a book that's sold. I think I was reading it's soul somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 million copies. Wow. Is that what it says? Yeah. Jeez, that's crazy. Well, you want an easy way. You want something that's easy. Everybody wants, you're in trouble, you're feeling whatever and they want something to come. Something come and help me. I mean it's where religion comes from. It's just please, there's that thing inside of us is like, ah, I want to believe if I believe, is that enough? It is a lot like that. Yeah. There was one of Trump's spiritual advisors was, uh, he's got some spiritual advisors, some woman who was, uh, telling people to send her money.

Speaker 1:          07:47          There was a set, send her money for January. There was some, so some whole article about it, but it's basically essentially the same thing. It's like the idea is that, what is she saying? Donald Trump's spiritual advisor. Paula white suggest people send her there January salary or face consequences from God. No. Is that true? She's attractive too. Is Interesting. Is that true? Yeah. Look at our Pam, I'll give you money. What do I gotta do? All right. I'll you what I do, Paula, how much do you need? I don't know if that's a good picture. Maybe she just looks cool when she's screaming. Yeah, she looks good. But, um, yeah, I would love for some, really, I would love for the day where there's some real powerful spiritual, uh, individual who doesn't ask for money. You will. That's fine. Who doesn't? Who? Real power. Powerful or spiritual individual. It's a huckster. That's what I mean.
