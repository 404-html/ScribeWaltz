Speaker 1:          00:00          Right, no Internet. And then it became the Internet when we're fully formed and as an adult. And then you got a chance to see it and even then screwed it up and made mistakes and got online within God viruses on your computer and saw some stuff he really didn't want to see

Speaker 2:          00:15          had that dial tone or you dial in when you were gay and then the picture would kind of come in and little, little blips. Oh yeah. Realize when he didn't really want to see it anymore. I go, oh, when was, when did you get first get a cell phone?

Speaker 1:          00:32          I got one real early. I've got a cell phone in the 80s. Wow. Yeah. Well it was a comedian and like 89, I think I had a cell phone. I had a cell phone in my car. It was like permanently bolted down to my car. Yeah, I got it. Those, so I could get, the thing about it was I could get gigs with it. So like, uh, some people get ahold of you. Yeah, I would like bill bloomin'. Right. Uh, who is the owner of, um, the Wilbur Theater in Boston. It was owner of the comedy connection back then. Always jokes around about it. He was like, you got a lot of work because you were the only comedian with his cell phone. Like so he could call me up and say, hey, you know, this guy just got a flat tire on his way to New Hampshire. Can you do the Gig?

Speaker 1:          01:14          I'm like, fuck yeah, I'm in. I'm, I'm there. I'm, no, I'm already in my car cause that's where my phone is dead. How much did you have to pay for that phone? I don't remember. It's, I couldn't afford it. No, I couldn't afford it. I remember not being able to pay for it after a while. Yeah, it was just, it was a dummy. I always spent more money than I had. I mean it's, yeah, I've never been good with finances. I've never been frugal. But he's one of those things where I realized I could get it. So I got it.

Speaker 2:          01:40          But you remember that status you'd have to drive around if you, before that, before you had that, that phone in your car, you'd have to drive what I'm looking for

Speaker 1:          01:47          a public payphone. Oh yeah. And you're getting a quarter's right or you had to have a calling card. You remember those things. He'd have a car I would get, I would get fake cards too. He could buy them off people. They were like, like counterfeit cards and they were good for a couple of days and they'd go under and you could buy other ones. And then there was other things you could do. You could take a sound device and put it up to the phone and you could get a, get a call with that. Like you would put up this thing to the voice box area and it would make noises like Eh. Yeah. And it would somehow or another

Speaker 2:          02:20          trick opened up the, uh, yeah, the line, I remember that we are, we used to before the, yeah, before the cell phone technology hit. And this is early days of being with the agency. When you were overseas, if you were in an urban setting, you spent half your time looking for operating payphones, right? Some 34th world country. You're trying to find a payphone that actually works. Cause you've got to make some sort of, you know, call related to whatever operation you're engaged in. And the kids, the kids, the kids today and the agency, you don't understand that, you know, cause they've all got great technology and mobile communications. But uh, yeah, in the old days it was, it didn't, it didn't work that way. There's people that even knew what a phone booth is. No, I, yeah, exactly. I take, they'd say like about fights. That's like a common expression.

Speaker 2:          03:05          These two could have fought in the phone. Both that could've fought fight. And I can't even say it could a fight in a phone booth. But today you say fight in a phone booth and people go, why don't just say they got a fight on her fucking, you know, something else that doesn't exist anymore. A wine barrel. This London, you're London now and you know that those iconic red phone booth, you haven't met a phone. It, there's a I'm work. What are they now? You just keep getting them up. Yeah, I think they kept him update. You could probably find one occasionally. It's got a phone in it, but it wasn't that long ago. I remember they actually had functioning phones in there. You would go outside any seven 11 or whatever. And they were doing a bank of payphones. I actually stopped and took a picture I was having, I forget where the hell are we nowhere pulled into a gas station.

Speaker 2:          03:46          It was, I was pulling out after, oddly enough, getting gas and uh, I looked over to the side and there was a pay phone against the wall. And then now that the receiver was just dangling on the ground, but I literally stopped, got out and took a picture of it so I could show my kids, you know, we used to make calls on these things. This is how it worked. I remember when there was no answering machines. You remember that? Yeah. Yeah. And the first answer machine and whoever your buddy was at got the answering machine first. You thought, man, that's the deal. That's so posh. And I remember we got an answering machine where you could call it, and then when the dial tone went on, you would punch in a code and you could listen to your messages and you weren't even home.

Speaker 2:          04:25          You could retrieve those messages crazy. You could call it of the car to your answering machine. Pick it. There's a, there's a funny, yeah. Okay. Maybe you shouldn't, I guess I, what do I know? But you should never start a story out by saying there's a funny story. There's this story that when Lyndon Johnson was a, was a precedent and not, not present, I take that back. He was in the Senate and it was another guy, Dirksen. It was a famous senator. And so Johnson was, uh, uh, one day he was, he was driving, Dirksen gets this call, I think I got their guy, right? It gets a call from Johnson and they're talking and Johnson and say, wow, I got to talk to you about this thing. He says, Whoa, Whoa, hold on. Oh, hold on a second. He says, I gotta, you know, we're just pulling up outside the building.

Speaker 2:          05:10          I got to get out. I'll call you when I get to my office and says, what are you, where are you calling me now? And he goes, well, I got a phone in my car. And so Dirksen hangs up and meet is this, I gotta get one of those. So he, this, as the story goes, he pulled some strings there in the Senate, got somebody to put a phone in his car, right? And so then he calls Johnson and he says, uh, Lyndon just calling your from from my car. And Johnson says, ah, that's, that's, that's great. Hold on a second. I got a call coming in on the other line. Thanks up on him. So, Eh, yeah. Yeah. Whether it's true or not, it's an apocryphal story. Phones in their car back then. Yeah. Well, you know, if you're a senator, what year did they invent?

Speaker 2:          05:50          Carphone's? Uh, probably the year you got one. No, I don't, I have no idea when they infected ones. But you know, uh, Jamie, we should look in 1946 1946 what, what? Yeah, yeah. Wait a minute. 1946 imagine will come up. Pimp you had to be in 1969 to pull up and like a 69 corvette. The fucking phone in your car or Lincoln town car. Whoa. This is what it, that's like a car phone is a mobile phone device specifically designed to be fitted in automobile. That's what we should call him back then. Car phones. Remember service originated with the bell system and was first used in Saint Louis. June 17th, 1946 before the fucking end of the war, right? Yeah. No, no, no. That was after the end of the war. End. 45 okay. Yeah. So a year after the World War II, that's an incredible phone in their car. And more importantly, why, why St Louis?

Speaker 2:          06:46          What was, what the hell is going on in St Louis? It, that's the site of the first car phone. Wow. It was a radio enthusiasts who had the foresight to invent the annoying habit of talk on the phone while in the car. So basically worked on the radio and it would somehow or another connect to a regular phone lines. Is that what it worked? Uh, Jesus Christ. Yeah. This is way beyond my apple watch rounds had this look Johnson had it when he was in the Senate. Yep. Yeah. So and that would have been, yeah. What's that? That's, that would have been like 15 years after this happened or, or 14 years after. After they invented it in Saint Louis. But, but yeah, I remember when they, you know, the mobile phone then was that big case do that. We carry around and give it to get out of your car set out out on your car and then it started getting too big fucking thing.

Speaker 2:          07:31          You throw over your shoulder a big handle. I've got a big box at home full of all the old phones that I've had over the years and it's like if I could ever get myself organized, I would turn it into some sort of wall art installation cause it's cell phones through the years at least covering the past three decades. It's certainly interesting. What do you got there at Jamie first developed in 1920 mobile wireless transmission device. Send and receive messages in the 1920s phone like in 19 and 20 Jesus, that guy behind him as the boss, you can tell he's, he's listening. He's the guy in charge, man.

Speaker 2:          08:09          Wow. Yeah. I think that would be a great idea to show kids today that I'm that old brick phone from Wall Street. Fantastic to the, was it called the star Tech Startac those were the bag I saw. Somebody's still using one of those the other day. Yeah, the little flip flops. A little flip phone with the little was kinda would come out. Yeah. To be fair, he dead. He had a Dork knob startac there was a sweet phone. I had one of those. I was like, oh baby. It was like, like Star Trek, right? You were like Captain Kirk with that thing. You flip it open and you're talking about maybe you can get an extra fat battery for it. Although that didn't set so well in your suit coat. It's terrible. Those fat batteries, but if you didn't have a fat battery, you can make a call for four minutes.

Speaker 2:          08:57          Battery Technology was terrible back there. That waterway fallen, by the way, has an excellent battle. It's got a great battery amp battery that battery is doing. It's sucking all the information out of your system and you got it. Yeah, but sweet, sweet signal that you get so long while it does that. It is true. It is true. Go out there kids, get yourself a Huawei bat phone, amazing cameras. They have a 40 megapixel camera in one. They make all sorts of white goods too, you know, like washers and dryers and refrigerators and those. They're putting all that stuff in our homes. Yes, it is. Yes, it, so I wouldn't, I wouldn't engage in any shenanigans in my kitchen.
