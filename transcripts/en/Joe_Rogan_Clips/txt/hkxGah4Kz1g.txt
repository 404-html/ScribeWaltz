Speaker 1:          00:00          What questions you want to ask me about Anthony? Bordain well, I wanted to talk to you about suicidal thoughts because you are out of the people that didn't kill themselves with you are a lot, huh? The one who knows the most about it and you've experienced depression, you know, and when I wasn't close with Anthony Bourdain, but I really liked him a lot when I'm with you once. Yeah. And when I hung out with him, I really enjoyed it. I did a show, we did an episode of his show in Montana and we went camping together and got fucked up by a campfire. Yeah, it was great. We had a great, great old time. It was really fun. But I was stunned when that happened. And uh, I mean I don't, I just wanted to know like when you were at your worst, when you were having like really shitty feelings, like what could have been anything that someone could have done that could've helped you?

Speaker 1:          00:54          Oh yeah. I think about this too. I lost a friend to suicide and it was like, yeah, you want to stop because like what, what, what could give done, right. Yeah. I mean sometimes just all follow me into a therapist that fuck, I couldn't afford. I mean I've told you this before, I probably on here. That was like a physical thing to do, but just getting me to go to accept like that maybe it'll work well, I, I knew when I was talking to you, that is a hard thing for you to talk about. So if you're bringing it up, it's a real, real issue. Yeah. Yeah. It's, you're stoic. Yeah. You're, you're not, you don't complain about that with my negative stuff, he's done. So I remember we were playing pool and I was like, what's matter? Like there's something going on, like you just seem like just unhappy or, and so once we got you into that psychiatrist and then dude, you popped out of that thing, like a fucking spraying pills.

Speaker 1:          01:48          Yeah. Neat. You went running. Like anybody who thinks that pills are all bad, I don't think anything's all anything. Yeah. I think I know the black and white problem where there are people, like I talked to Ben, she won, it seems like there are over prescribing pills. I'm like, they worked for me and he's like, well, I probably didn't. I'm like, no, no, no. Just because you think they're over prescribing, it doesn't mean they should never prescribed they're stuffed. It works. And sometimes it works enough for you to just change your way of looking at the world and change a reality and then you eventually weaned yourself off of them, which is really interesting. Well, it's a sprain of the brain muscle is what's happened. Um, I don't, it's not like a physical like pull like that. Um, but that's really what it is. Just a sprain.

Speaker 1:          02:29          And so like until you get off it, uh, to get on a cast, if some way it's going to be real hard for it to heal. [inaudible] you know, this is like so far this metaphor works. No, that does help. I stop. But I think it works in the most effective cases like yours of medication. So these pills act as a cast. And then at some point you're healed and you don't need them anymore. But the problem is, the only way to really know is if you just get off it and run on it and then you're like, oh fuck, I'm still hurt. And during that get off and run on a time is when you're suicidal. Thoughts shoot up if they were going to. So when they do wean you off, they're like, you need to keep up with me. Like any salt you get, you need to call me immediately.

Speaker 1:          03:11          You can do right back on. Like what was interesting with you is you are weaning off coincided with huge success in your career. Yeah, I got off him. I know where I got off on, it was my second apartment in New York, so this was three and a half years ago, four years ago maybe around there. This is not happening is already on comedy central. It's things are going, things are going good. Your tours, kicking ass, everything's great. And then you released my first hour and then my second hour. Yeah. And you were a legit success. He'll blow up. Was getting, you were on billboards. So beyond that I was, I mean more importantly was I was a working comic. I was like, oh, I can make a real living at this now for the first time. So that was like the best part. Yeah. And that hadn't been going on very long.

Speaker 1:          03:59          Right? Well, it was a hot, it's a fucking, people don't know. People don't know. It's a fucking crazy struggle. The struggle from open mic or too successful working comedian and everybody's different, everybody's got their own weirdness that they have to overcome, but it's a long ass bloody struggle by the way. That's why I hate this infighting and comedy. It's terrible. And it's like you're doing this wrong. You're Dong of just said, guys, we're all up against the most monumental odds. So you write safety safe show jokes and this guy writes Dick Jokes. It's like whatever. That's just like predispositions, but like it's hard. We're all in the same boat. Yeah. Anyway. Yeah, I agree man. And that dot. It didn't, it's very rarely been the case in the history of comedy that everybody kind of got along and just accepted the fact that everybody does things differently and not make, not, don't make a big deal out of it.

Speaker 1:          04:49          Yeah. We'd have to have factions inside of r one. You want to have a safe space show? I get it. Yeah. People don't want to hear shit like that. It's okay. Have you ever been a show Black Knight? And that's fine to have everything. Everyone's defensive. Oh my. Everyone wants to hold their ground and stand up for their position on things. It's like, okay, you're going to be fine. Everyone's going to, because we've just, it's the best time to be time every just kick ass. Just keep writing. Just go out there and do it. Um, yeah. And then it got better. But a lot of that was it the focus I was able to get because of these, it was rent. Uh, no, nope, not Wellbutrin. I try Wellbutrin. The problem is some of these pills, like the side effects are not worth it. So what I tell people, like someone had a problem once, a fucking anxiety, um, use of, I don't care about this shit Nikki stuff and um, and uh, he's right now planning on bombing embassy.

Speaker 1:          05:41          Um, and it was like he didn't want to go on it cause he was afraid it would make him like a Zombie and I'm like okay, if it does just go back off it, you don't have to commit forever. Right. You know what I mean? Just see what the effects are. So on I think Wellbutrin, uh, I couldn't come. Oh it was fresh. I, I wouldn't even say it was any sort of psychopath or anything cause I didn't know about that as a side effect until that was happening with my girlfriend at the time. And I was like, what the fuck? It was like three times in a row. I was like, I just couldn't come. And then she was like, oh maybe it's those pills. I'm like, why? Really? And then I looked, I was like, oh yeah, fucking annoying. It's an annoying thing.

Speaker 1:          06:16          That's super annoying. There was this one called rem or Ron, think about like how many circuits there are so much in there and they'll think it's something that gets in there and fixes this because I can't, I'm gonna take that away. You edit your own computer. My God, I'm like taking those. It's almost like you edit your own op. Remember we went to u have a, a PC. You can get into dos fragment do shit. Yeah. That's almost like what you're doing. So the side effect on run run, these side effects don't hit everybody the same. And what's you're looking to fill in? Isn't it all the same? So don't just get with somebody else gets you got to talk to a therapist. But like Rem Ron gave me hyper Phasia oh. Which is the inability to be feel full. So they said expect to gain 15% of your body weight.

Speaker 1:          07:00          Uh, and I could eat dude, if I got high, I could eat like eight plates of Spaghetti. I mean, I would eat out my whole apartment. Holy Shit. Everything. It got to the point where I was like, well, I got one big left and peanut butter and some a little bit of Cheerio's and fucking let's do this. Hey was, it was glorious, but that it wasn't helping me. That was a problem. That was a side effect because I was thin then I could've dealt with, I can be 15 pounds overweight instead of 10 pounds underweight, but like it didn't help me mentally. Mm. Fuck. Um, and then I finally got on one to sit for me. That was like, it worked. I was like, boom, I'm out. I get it. I'm free now a little bit. Um, but low blood pressure. So sometimes I stayed up, I got to hold onto something and like, it's not fucking faint, but barely ever happens.

Speaker 1:          07:47          Totally worth it. And that still happens now when I get high. But like do you get like dizzy, lightheaded? Yeah. I stand up. I'm like, hold on, you got to get real high. Went for that to happen or early or something like that. Or if I'm getting sick, that'll happen. But I used to get that in high school too. I think I'm already predisposed to it, but they made it a little worse. Not, not a big deal though. So I finally found the one that worked for me, but it's hard and if you're not having it, your brain is lying to you or it's giving you a version of reality that's like, I mean, I saw this last night coming home from the airport from Burbank airport and some lady picks up an Uber, picked up a guy on the wrong side of the fence and she was, sorry, it's my first time here.

Speaker 1:          08:26          But like, it's one of those little fences you can just step over almost, you know? And he's like, well, everyone else is going on here. Which is like, yeah, sorry. It's my first time at the Burbank airport. I can, and you can't get a walk 10 seconds to where it's an opening and he's lying. He's like, pop the trunk, pop the trunk place. And I'm like, Oh, you're cranky from flying. I know what that is. And so your version of this reality is, this is a way worse thing than it really is. Steve Simone who never gets upset, which was like, I no big deal. I'll just come around and then it's over. Yeah. It's the same thing we've talked to Fitzsimmons like you can just not punch somebody and then forget about it, but you know, if you're, if you're thinking that angrily all the time, it's really affects you and this shit makes you think the worst of everything.

Speaker 1:          09:02          Wow. It's like, yeah, no matter what it is a little worse than it should be an interesting way of looking at it. Yeah. And it just gets tiring after awhile and the suicidal thoughts start happening when you're like, I can't do this anymore. You know, it's effort. It's mental effort to just like, oh, it just keeps, it's like you've got to rock on you that you're pulling up, pushing off you at all times and you just need the game to be over. You just need a sleep. The Yvonne used to have a bit about, I think he probably didn't have special or something by now, but it was like if you want that deep sleep, that deep sleep, like that's what it is, where you just want to sleep forever. You just weighed down by it all the time. Yeah. It's like, you know how they used to like, um, get people to give false confessions by just keeping them awake for like 30 straight hours until they eventually, like they don't know how to say no.

Speaker 1:          09:58          The fine I did it and stuff they did didn't do, they weren't anywhere near it, but they're just saying, yes, I murdered somebody, let me sleep. It's just a version of that, you know, where you're just like, he's just so sick of it. After a while I will tell you that they have read about it and they say the people who talk about suicide or sort of different, the people who are thinking about it quietly, quietly is weight way more often to commit it. Um, I think they say the people talking about it as a way to seek help. So what can you do it, the question was what could you do to help people? Is there anything that anybody could have done? You know, it used to make me mad when you told me just get out of bed to some exercise. I was like, you don't get it.

Speaker 1:          10:42          You don't get it. I definitely don't get it. Yeah. Shandra understood at once. She was like talking about that. She was like, he doesn't understand. You can't even go to your fridge. Like exercises. Not even, it's just so far from like no way I could couldn't even get out of bed. What do you think was, you were also taking Propecia then it had anything to do with it because that's one of the side event I'm for sure might have. I mean it was right around then and I think, I'm trying to think, um, if I was quitting right then on it and switch into the fucking spread, um, come on. Stem cell research.

Speaker 1:          11:23          But I think it was either on it or, or, or getting off it. Yeah, for sure. For sure. Could have had something to do with that. Yeah, I think so too. It was also, um, uh, live in girl. I mean there was so many things right around that. So all it takes is a sprain. So like here's the weird thing. Let's say you lost your job and that sends you into depression. It's not, that is not related to something. A lot of times it will be related, something a mom dies, dad dies. But let's say the job situation, because you can change this, right? Your Dad dies, you'll never get them back. You know, feels bad. And so like it should feel bad. You lose your job, you're going to depression, but now you get a better job. You know what I mean? Not that you will, but let's just say you did the depression remains.

Speaker 1:          12:04          The causes of depression is necessarily gone. You're doing better than the thing that made you depressed, but you're still depressed because that brain is sprained. So you need a way to fight it. And pills don't work for everybody, so it's fucking disheartening. And getting the right people. I had a therapist say, well, I was like, this, this one, pills not work. It's like, wow, I don't know what to tell Ya. And I was like, and in my head I was just like, okay, I accept it all. Work up the courage eventually, and that'll be the end of it. I was like, well, how am I going to fight you on it? I don't want to fight this in the first place. It's not going to work. How she was the worst, what was it like to get pulled out of the clouds? Like when the pills that pills started working, working at first it, it's like you don't trust that it's gone.

Speaker 1:          12:49          It's like right when the hiccups leave, you still feel like you're the hiccups, right? You know, but like a way longer version of that. And then what happens where it is you start to miss it because it became so much of your reality and who you were that like it's this thing that's been pulled away from you. A part of you is gone. Hmm. So it's weird that you're like, miss this horrible way of being, um, because you had to figure out a way to like make a positive at this. And you see this a lot in like PC culture, we start sort of bragging about your victimization or that things have happened to you, but like it's a way to stand out and be a special that you ended up propping the, the, the negative up instead of instead of saying, yeah, that was Shitty, you know, you started almost like bragging about it, right?

Speaker 1:          13:43          So you start feeling like, well at least I'm different. So that can prop you up a little. At least I'm unique in this thing of like it doesn't seem like anyone else is having these suicidal thoughts, you know? Um, it's almost like if you're only the only one to do a band, you feel better than if everyone else into that same band. The band is, the album is the album, but you like it more because you're the only one noticing your own uniqueness. It's like, so maybe it was that, I'm not really sure, but when I was out of it, that was missing it a little bit and then followed by a fear that it's going to come back because regular d, okay, that's a terrible word. Depression because it also means just, I'm depressed today. Right. Clinical depression is different, but overlaps, you know, it doesn't just go away.

Speaker 1:          14:26          Right. If I'm depressed because I'm cranky, I got to tell myself, don't be cranky. Say Five things. You're thankful for you. She'll be out of it. Get some sunshine, you're fine. This is like deeper. So like then when you do get depressed, like let's just say I haven't been outside all day. It's been raining for two straight days, you know, he just a little like blue. You're like, oh fuck, is it back? You know? And then when it's gone in a day like Oh God, but when it's like two days like fuck fuck, fuck, don't come back. Wow. Yeah. But the the, so a bear like a bad weather day could set it off a little bit. No, that just gives like the normal depression that everybody gets right at. That's, I think I really should be two separate terms. Feeling blue fill and blue, which you, you get.

Speaker 1:          15:09          He hadn't been on stage in four days. I feel a little blue if I, if I, I don't know if I can get my underwear out all day too. I can't live in Vancouver. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Those people get depressed. You don't get outside Seattle. They don't get outside while they get outside where they get rained on. Yeah. So it's just like he just feeling down. I remember when Duncan and I were filming something up there and we were doing that big foot and we were talking to this guy who was a cop who was like the security guy for the set and uh, he was like, dude, it fucking wears on you. He was, he was at the end of the rainy season. It was just starting to get warm again. Wears on that in New York. My first New York went to was this one and it, it wasn't so much middle of March for, I was like, whatever I could, I could take it.

Speaker 1:          15:49          I took the winter, it was middle of April where I'm like, uh, Knopf already I put in the three or four months. Oh, so the question is the want though. What the thing is, you could do what you want. You could leave. I could leave. I went skiing a lot of the 16 days of skiing this year. When did that around like road dates. That's what's crazy about like somewhere like Denver. Like it's sunny, sunny. It's great. It's great. So much better when it's sunny. It's cold out, but it's, it's sunny. Like if you have to pick warm and cloudy all the time or cold and sunny. I take cold and sunny all day long. Yeah, for sure. All Day long. Sunny, sunny skiing outside of the sun when it's like, oh, it's good. It's 25 degrees. But it's just, you don't even walking around. Yeah, it's brisk out.

Speaker 1:          16:30          But look how pretty the sky is. Blue, blue sky and fluffy clouds. Did you know Anthony Bordain was, was depressed? No, I heard with him a little. It was a mixture of mixing drugs, mixing pills and alcohol could have the hammer. I bow, I believe he was on some sort of malaria medication, which is dangerous if some people, um, violent people get violent. I've seen people on malaria medication while they were drinking. And, uh, I had a hold the guy back from attacking or a quarter or at least worried about him attacking a report on. So it was a friend of mine. It was a very kind friend of mine who I would, I don't think we'd ever in normal life attack a person physically. And it seemed like he was about to, it makes you think not even normal. He was squirrely. Um, it was, he had to go to Africa.

Speaker 1:          17:19          If he had, he had, um, visit somewhere in Africa and he had to take these pills and some of them have violent reactions to people. You're not supposed to drink on them, first of all. And he was drinking. It's mixing. Yeah. And you know, if that's what he was doing and he's mixing that with alcohol, who fucking knows? So that could have happened with board anywhere. It might not have been long term depression, but I know there's studies on people who have got a concussion in football practice and then hung themselves at night. Oh yeah. No history of it, but right then everything. I mean, it's almost like you're on psychedelics. This new reality is real. It feels real.

Speaker 1:          17:54          So I, the question is, is there something you could've done? I don't know. I don't know what the right, I've thought about it. I don't know what the right thing is. Cause you, you push away people's help. Right? I saw somebody posted on Facebook once where it was like one of the worst things about depression is everybody going to see, I've been through that too. It's like if now I'm not even unique, you know, give me my props for my individual substance. So then it's like you want to help by somebody who's saying, yeah, I've been through this, but it's like, it's not even helping them, but like who the fuck knows what they're feeling? Right. That's the other thing about a person's feelings, what they're feeling. It's very personal. It's almost impossible to describe. Oh, by the way, I had moderate depression. That's where the therapist said what you saw was moderate depression.

Speaker 1:          18:41          Jesus, I don't know what severe depression looks like. Jesus. So I don't know, man. I don't know. I lost somebody to, and I don't know if I could have said something to her or like, you know, um, Anthony liked to drink. He drank a lot. Yeah. And uh, watching him over the last four years, like you could see that he's, he'd seemed like he had been living a hard life. You know, he looked like it on television too. You've been living a hard life. I mean, he was out there hitting it, traveling from country to country, constantly drinking constantly. Alcohol's a depressant. It just is. If you drink alcohol all the time, you're not going to come out of it with a sunny disposition as the present. It is a depressant. I mean, you can definitely do it and pull it off. And we do.

Speaker 1:          19:27          And you know, occasionally you'll have a couple of drinks and then the next day you won't. But if you're doing that all the time, if you're doing it every day, five days a week, a lot of people use that because it's a short term relief from depression, longterm depressant. So a lot of people use alcoholism to cover up the depression. And then they get clean. Suddenly all the shit they're supposed to have been dealing with is now still there and not being covered up by alcohol. Yeah. Yeah. Fun that comes with a couple of drinks. The, there's a fuck. Absolutely. It's fun. Fuck it. Let's stop worrying. Yeah. It would spend how addicted to it. I can't, I wish I could do that with cigarettes when everybody's smoking, but I'll go right back to a pack. So do you, do you, do you think like, fuck, what could I have done?

Speaker 1:          20:07          No, because I wasn't close enough to them and I wasn't there. If I was there, I would be tortured by it. Yeah. If I was there and I was hanging out with them and it happened in [inaudible] tomorrow and then I would have been tortured. Yeah. That would then with anybody, you know, it's such a crazy decision to make the decision to just stop living when so many people loved you and you have this crazy life that, uh, it's the most bravest thing to me. Yeah. I can't imagine something. It's, that's the only thing that held me back is just the lack of courage to be like, just do it and it's like your DNA is telling you, but stop and think about you. What you've from not doing that you become wildly successful. Yeah. And way happier and you're having a great fucking time. I have the architect of my own happiness and his fucking, I'm doing it well doing it the way you're supposed to do it, but you're, you know, you've been doing it like this for several years now and if you, I guess it really doesn't matter in the end, but if you end your own life, you would have never experienced all this true.

Speaker 1:          21:14          But if you had to go back and do it again, it's interesting you were at like a tipping point man, you're this weird tipping point and you just went that way and you're free. Just took a while. It was definitely a struggle. But you, you were free I find when talking to comics, other comics because now I feel a little guilty, you know, for success around around people that are also quite funny who don't have it. And what I found is that it's, you get this frustrating point run around eight nine 10 12 years of comedy where like your skills have gotten better and your monetary career has not gotten better. Seo, artistic careers booming and then you're just not even making a living. And it's the most frustrating cause like I'm finally good at open mic level. Like, or make a good joke that's a window and sewn.

Speaker 1:          21:58          I made a good joke tonight, this week or one time this month, you know? But like they are, it's like I'm doing so well on stage. I'm killing. Why am I, why am I still working this day job? Why am I not even ever on TV? Why am I, you know, it's real frustrating. It might've been around that time too or just getting frustrated with like, you know, I was less hacky but also just not succeeding. Is it interesting how the Internet's changed everything or for, you can support people so much easier. Before it was like you had the man show, you could hire a writer and that's it. That's the only help you could do for someone. Yeah. You know, take a couple people on the road with you, but then now it's like, Hey, go watch this guy show, hey, this guy's got into special. Hey, check out so and so's got a new book.

Speaker 1:          22:44          You know, changes everything. Yeah. And people are going, it's literally no skin off your back. Yeah. It's like, well, it's great. You're actually, it's good. Like I, if Tom Papa asked me to promote something he's doing, I want people to go see him. It's good. It's good for me. I want him to do good because I like listening to him. I like watching them, so I want them to make more comedy. Oh yeah. Then you went, because I get to see you more. I got to get to sell out comedy. Good person gets to stay in it. Not that he needs us, but it also will, like with Tom, when you tell people about someone who's really funny, whether it's you or whoever it is, then they trust you. They go, I want to see that guy. He's a fucking Lexus. They know that you're telling the truth.

Speaker 1:          23:24          Like if I tell him, Hey Joey Diaz, the funniest guy that's ever lived and you go see him at the Ice House one night and come out of it, you, you're bleeding from your, your internal bruising for laughing. I love guaranteeing people on Twitter or whatever. It's like, you don't know. I guarantee you will have a great night. There's someone who's an awesome comic. Just, just, there's no like, well my friend. It's like, just, they'll be great. Yeah. There's, there's people that you could do that with, but yeah, there was, you know, before it was like you got on the tonight show, you know, he did. So that was an actual time that I let her man, people talked about, you had to build up places, you had to travel to places all the time. So those people would come back every time they came back. You better have some new shit, dude, I really got to think about it.

Speaker 1:          24:04          I have like when you start saying that depression of paypal, like what can you, what can I do? Anybody do? Is there anything anybody can do? It's like just a little bit like being there for you. Sometimes it's helpful. Just be like, hey man, you're just your good friend. I know you're going through something, but just know that I like you just like a little bit and don't require anything of them, but I guess everybody be different too, but like, I don't know, don't know. Everybody's on a different trip. That's the thing. It's like no one knows what anyone is feeling. Telling someone to get over it is not the way to do it. That's, that ain't going to help. The tough love thing. It's like that doesn't work. That works for fucking nothing. I don't know what it works for, but not that it works for lazy people.

Speaker 1:          24:48          Yeah, exactly. I don't think it works for them. I don't even think it works for them. I think that gets people to move sometimes, but it doesn't change the way they think about what they're doing. They just get forced into doing it. You know? It's like the argument, well actually not like that when I was going to say, but it's, it's you, you want them to act and so they act because of force of your your will. Right. Trying to scare them into it. Yeah. But if you inspire someone and say to him, listen, I know you're looking at it this way, but this is why this is going to hurt you by approaching it this way. You're going to do the same thing. But instead of approaching it the way you're approaching it, stop. And just for a shift of perspective, think about it in a positive way.

Speaker 1:          25:26          Like you could do that to people and sometimes you can actually shift the way they look at something because a lot of times it's the way you're approaching something that's pissing you off about it. And the way to get through sometimes to people is not to tell them this is the way you should do it. But just to paint the picture and let them make their own decision. Yeah. To be like, oh, so you're happy when you're run? Yeah. Okay. Is it, is it warm out? Oh, it is. Okay. I don't know. You're less happening. You don't run. Alright. Well, it was like, instead of be like, you got to get out there and run. I, you know, I have kids raising kids. One of the things that I learned that works really good is anytime they do anything, I tell them I fucked up way worse than you.

Speaker 1:          26:02          I don't use the word fucked. All right? And I said, whatever you've done, I've messed up way more like I, everybody messes. Don't worry about it. This is a part of being a kid and I'm super proud of you for admitting that you made a mistake or that you did this. This is great because this is how you learn. You're not supposed to know everything. You're eight years old or you're 10 years old. You're, you're supposed to be learning, learning about life and those people who are supposed to be talking about various things you encounter. You don't supposed to already know everything. You're a little kid. This is great. So we learned something that we don't want to do anymore. This is great. This is an awesome opportunity. And nobody, I wished somebody talked to me like that and I will tell them that too.

Speaker 1:          26:38          I go cause I get called stupid and yelled at or whatever. Whatever the fuck it was when I did something. This is how people talk to kids back then they didn't, you know, it's not even anybody's fault. Someone does something dumb. You know, in the 1960s or something like that. They threw things at them. You know, like my, my parents were telling me about things flying across the room at them, you know, like people stop, they just fucking that little, the kids were animals back then too. You know, people are different. Yeah. Yeah. So it might be that like something that helped me, I don't know if people are listening are going through it or whatever, but like some things that have helped that I was able to take was I had one therapist said one good thing where he's like, imagine the good things out of the depression.

Speaker 1:          27:18          Yeah. Instead of looking at it as only negative, um, what's it helped you with? And then I was like, Ooh, I'm going to try that. And it was like, I'm looking at my standup material more realistically and darker and that's actually helpful on stage. He's like, all right, cool. That's one good thing out of this. And then it just like sort of, it might just help you like it's not all bad. Adjust the way you approach it. Yeah. Another thing was say five things and just in the shower, whenever you do shower, say five things out loud that you were thankful for. Doesn't have to be monumental stuff. Just like it's 75 today. That's good. Um, I got a new bar soap. That's cool. Um, uh, my friend John, you know, whatever, Brian, I like him. That's cool. A lot of have that in my life.

Speaker 1:          28:02          Just five things to say it out loud. And then after a while some of that that ended up affecting my mood. Hmm. You know where instead of, cause that was the problem was the focus. I don't know if I ever told you this thought it was a negative thing. Yeah. So it'd be like a 75 degree day. This is the example I use 75 degrees and sunny. It's fucking every day in La, you know? And I would be like, instead of going like this is fucking Rad, it's February 12th and I am fucking in shorts, this is great. Instead of focusing in that, I would focus on like fuck, I got, I got my car has no gas, I got to fucking go get gas. I hate having to fucking get gas. You got to pull over. And so then I'm only focusing on this fucking one minute chore, but I have to do instead of on all the good stuff. And so you just focus. It just makes you focus on this negative and he's just like, can't pull out of it. So anything you can do to like shift the focus to the positive is helpful.
