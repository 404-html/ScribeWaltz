Speaker 1:          00:00          Things was like, I, I had tried to encourage Phil Hartman to do stand up several times because he would do standup where he would warm up for the, you know, the, the crowd would be there for the show. And in between scenes, there was always some downtime and Phil would take the warmups microphone and do bitch riff. And I do like, is Bill Clinton impression? This was during the whole Monica Lewinsky scandal. So he had like all this material about Bill Clinton and Monica and his impressions were amazing. Yeah. Yeah. No, he's like, he's one of my favorites of all time on that show. Yeah. He was amazing. And so he was thinking about what is this two shows? Where is he Huntsville, Alabama still doing stand up look. And then he didn't give a fuck. Look at, I'm out there with those glasses is great. Hey, looks happy.

Speaker 1:          00:48          He looks back at 14 likes. Hey, I'm Jon Lovitz get out the likes looking on my legs. Yeah. So he's still doing it. Interesting. Yeah. Good for him. Good for him. Like I said, I always liked him. Great Guy. When I did SNL, I think it was the first season where he had, he had just left I think because I did it pretty much probably if I had to pick a season, I would been, that would've been that when I did, cause he still had Carvey and you still had, you know, Hartman and Victoria Jackson, like the whole kind of group. But um, I forgot him of Victoria Jackson. She was fucking hilarious. Yeah. What happened to her? She's a hardcore conservative now. Yeah. Huge. Like right wing, right winger. She's put on a little weight, you know, but I haven't wheel and uh, yeah, no, she's actually a hardcore conservative.

Speaker 1:          01:36          No, like she, she shouted from the mountaintops, what was she like when you met her? She was fine. I mean, listen, when she conservative back then I was busy doing the show kind of thing, you know what I mean? Cause it's a lot of work. And in which war? No, he, that I, I had to do, um, I had to do it without cue cards because my father didn't want me to use cue cards. So I don't like to memorize all that stuff. Plus Fuck Dad plus plus the skits. That didn't even make it into the show. So like I had to memorize like schizo didn't even end up in the, this kind of Shit is that dad, you know, I, like I said, I had a good memory and he didn't want me reading. You know, cause it, you can see it, they can see it when people are reading and he didn't want me to do in that.

Speaker 1:          02:14          So. Wow. So Nokia card, but also that means the other actors do cue card for them either. Yeah, of course not. You know, like, yeah, no, I'm sure my father made a lot of friends looking at like, you know that that weekend. Well that's fucked up. Like how can he dictate whether or not the other actors get cue cards? I don't know. Because it's because he apparently he could. Victoria Jackson's a hardcore conservative. It's so straight. Like I said, she shouts it from the, from the mountaintops looking again active. Yeah. So she was like, you know, so it was that whole kind of group, that kind of late eighties group. Uh, but then also it was a, it was my, a second season, I think, you know, it was, it was like, you know, Schneider, Sandler Rock. It was like that kind of overlap year. So I actually got like a really kind of like really good group that Leanne, I'm so, no, that was awesome. That was neat.
