Speaker 1:          00:00          But it's also, they're documenting some of the greatest standup specials in the history of stand up. There's like the Chappelle specials, the two recent ones that he did. They're putting that stuff out there and they're, they're doing it in a way where no one else would do it. Like Hbo, which was the gold standard for the longest time. Yeah. They would never do two Dave Chappelle specials at the same time. Netflix is like, okay, we'll do Dave's like, I got this new shit I want to do. I'm going to do it in the belly room at the comedy store. You know, and Dave was so ridiculous about it. Dave and I were downstairs. Yeah. While he was doing this, while he was filming this, we're downstairs, uh, in the smoking area of the comedy store getting high as fuck. Yeah. And uh, he was so casual about it is like, hey man, you want to do a set?

Speaker 1:          00:44          You did a set on the, no, no, no. I just want to watch. I said, no, no. I did three sets a night. I go, I'm just going to chill and hang out in the back of the room, but he was so relaxed, like during his special being taped, he's offering me a guest set. He's like, hey man, I'll do a set, you know? He still shows up. He'll fly to places and show up and just do guests sets. Yeah. I was in Denver. I come out the green room, it's Friday night and chapels in the green room and I go there with it and goes, hey Joe. I go, what are you doing? Oh Man. It felt like coming to Denver. I go, you want to do a set? It's like, oh yeah, fuck it. So I bring him up on stage. The audience is leaving, they're leaving.

Speaker 1:          01:22          Can I come back? It's your pals here. They're like, what's, yeah, yeah. Everybody comes back. He does 40 minutes. It was amazing because that's how he's doing it. He's like, he's doing it for the art. He's not doing it because he's making any money. Loves. He did a free 40 minute show for these people that came there to see me. Fucking loves it and it's loves it. And he's, it's like true with him, man. He's a perfect example of that just being true. He'll show up Monday night at the comedy store in front of 13 people and he'll go on stage. I'll do a half an hour in front of 13 people. Yep. And he'll drink and smoke cigarettes and we'll talk shit and laugh at his own jokes. And everybody has like one of the most magical experiences as a, as an audience member you could ever have. I was young comic in New York and there was a place called the comedy village, which was the Boston too. Sure. So it became comedy village. When did it become the village? And it's done now, but now it's like a Japanese restaurant, a Japanese restaurant now. Got It. Jamie cutten. No, but, uh, there's a, um, uh,

Speaker 2:          02:21          and this is, I'm young like bark and asking people to come in off the street. Right. And, um, how old were you when you started? A 23, 23. 23. Yeah. And, um, and Chappelle comes in and when he gets on stage, there's probably 13 people in the crowd, right. And the fucking word gets out and you just see people start slowly graphs like goldfish. You know what I mean? When they could send some little or ducks or something like that, when they send some breads coming in the pond and the place was packed within like 20 minutes. Wow. Outside. It was just everybody texting their friend. Oh my God. Chappelle's here to do so crazy. And he did six hours, Bro. One

Speaker 1:          03:00          real dude. There were beer girls like falling asleep or something. Maybe four hours, 24 hours, something like that.

Speaker 2:          03:07          It, it, it's, it was jazz. Right? It wasn't like, it wasn't like I'm doing bits and I'm murdering the whole time. He has this ability to make the audience comfortable intention so that it is not anxiety inducing. Right. What, what he can do is talk to you for five minutes straight without a punchline. As an audience member, you're not going, oh my God is this guy, is this guy not funny? Well, that was when he was,

Speaker 1:          03:35          he was doing that for a while and where he wasn't doing scheduled shows, all he was doing was these Poppins. And not only that, but he, he brought a fucking speaker and set up a microphone in the park in Seattle,

Speaker 2:          03:48          outdoor, outdoor. You know, he did that early on.

Speaker 1:          03:51          Yeah, I was there. I watched it. We watched him do it in Montauk, New York. I saw him do it in Montreal. We did a set together at club soda and actually we got outside. We went outside and Dave just said, gather round. People gather it. And he started doing stand up to people in the street and they were like, what in the fuck? He was probably like 20.
