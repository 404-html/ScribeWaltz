Speaker 1:          00:00          Really, cause he was talking about, we ended up getting off on this whole, I don't know how we got there, but we started off on this whole tangent about uh, about just, you know, sobriety and stuff and he's like, man, you know, back in my day, and he was, I can't remember the exact dialogue, but it was just, yeah, I mean those guys were all, it was all just a blur.

Speaker 2:          00:22          I learned something from Argus. Argus runs like insane numbers of miles every day, like 12 miles, 15 miles a day.

Speaker 1:          00:30          The addict in him, the guy that loved getting wasted, that's his high now. He talks about it all the time. It's runner's high.

Speaker 2:          00:37          It's real. Yeah. It's real. I know now because of this month, this month, the sober October month, dude, I worked out no less than at least two hours. That's a small workout. A small workout. Well that's all I could get in was two hours. The longest I did. I did six hours one day. Good Lord. Six hours of insane cardio. It's like both kill bills. I did seven. I did seven hours of cardio in the last two days between yesterday and the day before. Seven hours of hard cardio, different stuff, running the hills with a dog. Lipstick.

Speaker 1:          01:09          What are your own heating with fat people, right? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:12          No, I'm competing with myself. First of all, my main competition is Ari Shaffir. And whether you realize it or not, Arusha, fear, even though he doesn't exercise are he has a strong mind. He's a very strong mind. Ari Ran 15 miles the other day, 15 miles. He rode five kilometers and then after he wrote five kilometers, he um, he did something else. He rode his bike. He rode a bike for a certain amount of miles. How long did it take him to run? 15 miles. The whole thing. His whole workout was, I think four hours. Good.

Speaker 1:          01:44          He's got that power Jew gene. He's got that escape from concentration camp Jean Dude,

Speaker 2:          01:49          he's, he's, you saw a fucking hard, he was going on the rowing machine. He goes hard, dude. He stayed in the 80% on the rowing machine for an hour. I mean, he really did. I saw him, I was the out there with them. I filmed it, I put it up on Instagram. That's that point when Burt was making fun of him for being at 75 for just walking. Isn't that him being out of shape? It's not because when Burton him went walking, he was in way better shape than Bert [inaudible] rides his bike in New York and he walks a lot in New York and even though he's not in great shape, like in terms of like a guy who runs in comparison to Bert, he's in fantastic shape. When they went hiking together, bird had a stop like a bunch of times we, so we're going to stop and I was pissed off.

Speaker 2:          02:28          He's like, why do I have to stop? Because you're fat. Like he's like yelling. Yeah. So like he wanted to see what would happen if the two of them went out together and did the exact same hiking. Who's cause uh, Bert was saying, oh, it's because you're not in shape, so your, your heart is always at 80%. No, Ari in a week is in way better shape. That bird is in his whole life of working out and drinking vodka every night compared to birth, but compared to Burke. But my point is he was my real competition. I was very, very much worried about him. So up until uh, two days ago, everything seemed to be going good. I was working out really hard and uh, I was put, it was hard. It's hard to do three hours a day. It's three and a half hours a day. Two days in a row is three and a half hours a day. Um, but I started peeing and he started coming out dark. Oh No. Like ice tea. Oh Shit. This sounds like a guy at a Porta potties.

Speaker 1:          03:24          Sweet tea. Sweet tea. What does it, what does he say at the end? Oh, bless you. God bless you God

Speaker 2:          03:34          for your sweet tea. I was famished. Um, yeah. Um, it didn't look good. Oh yeah. Today I had to go to some at my kid's school, there's some Halloween thing and I had to go up three flights of stairs, free long flights of stairs. I got to top, first of all, I barely made it upstairs. I got to the top, I was out of breath, my legs were shaking. Whoa. Three flights of stairs. And I was like, okay, I might have fucked something up. Oh man, that was today. Today. What does it mean? Um, I think my body's breaking down. Ah, I think I've got like serious muscle breakdown to the point. Like my muscles are so sore that I've, I'm ignoring that they're sore and even though they're really, really sore, I'm still doing like three hours of cardio. Like I limped up to the, uh, to the trail when I ran with my dog yesterday and then I ran two miles and then after I ran two miles, I did an hour and a half on the elliptical machine. And then after I did an hour and a half on the elliptical machine, I did 45 minutes to kicking the bag, punching and kicking the back.

Speaker 1:          04:41          I took two naps yesterday, two separate nabs.

Speaker 2:          04:46          My point is argus Tommy something by telling me about this high that you get from all this cardio. And I was like, what kind of fucking nonsense that I knew that there's like an endorphin high but I didn't, I didn't think it was really specific but there's a very specific high that you get and it's like if you could take a pill that puts you in the state of mind that I am when I work out this month, everybody would take it in the world. Be a better place because you don't give a fuck. Right. You don't give a fuck about anything. I mean not they don't care about people and friends and loved ones, but there's no anxiety is no. All the chatter, all the negative chatter that you get in the brain that you have to like push off and ignore, that's shuts off. Right. Gone. Nonexistent. And I wonder how much of that is there because your, your brain is almost trying to create problems and conflict because you're not getting enough exercise. Yeah. Because your, your body supposed to get a specific amount of exercise. Huh?

Speaker 1:          05:43          My dog is a, I think like eight months old or something now. And I've learned a lot from having this dog this time. Like I didn't notice a lot of stuff with the other dog stuff, but you know, just the being weird little things by nibbling at your finger a different way with just her little front teeth, like sorta like telling you something like, hey dude, I need to fuck and get some exercise in and we're all the, we're, we're, we are that same way. So our brain is going to make more complex ways for us to be freaked out, basically run for our lives. Right. Like if I don't just, I mean, again, I barely do cardio, but I do do it pretty consistently, but it's short. It's like a mile or two. That's all you need really. Yeah. But, and it cleanses the palate. It's like ginger between Sushi slices and, and if I go without it, absolutely it compiles, I'll wake up bitter and angry about something. I'll see something on, you know, somewhere or something or you work.

Speaker 2:          06:42          Yeah. You know, doing things that he's not supposed to do. Yeah. He just, you know, it was just a ball of energy, but a lease, he doesn't have like anxiety and negative chatter. The complex human mind when it doesn't have enough energy output. I was thinking of, the brain is almost like a battery that has a lid on it and there's like energies like flowing out of the battery and spilling over the sides and causing a mess. Cause you've got to expand or expend a certain amount of energy every day in order to keep it clean, just to keep everything going. Well, yeah, dude, I feel fucking great other than the fact that I can't walk good, but it's just, I went too hard. It's just too hard. But I wanted to get so far ahead. My goal was to get so far ahead that no one could catch up.
