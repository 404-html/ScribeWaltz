Boners I, there's a real, you asked me one time ever they had a lady, uh, I felt like I got an erection on a plane and she got pissed.

It was in your pants and she saw it somehow. Yeah, she saw my pants cause I wear lean pants, lean pants or you know, I wasn't wearing like a like a fat suit canvas or anything, you know, textiles that that's crazy that she's looking over at your race. But I guess if I was a woman and a dude had a rock hard boner, just like a couple of fee, I would know. That's like a ticking time bomb. Like hey, all right, but I'm on a plane, I'm going home.

Even when we're talking about like business stuff. Like you can tell like you get, you focus on things, which is good. If it's a good thing, you know, but sometimes that kind of thinking can get away from you. Yeah.
