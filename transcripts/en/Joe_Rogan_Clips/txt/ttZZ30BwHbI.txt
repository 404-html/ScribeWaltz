Speaker 1:          00:00          Search net gear for it's there. Dump it. It doesn't keep rolling. There's no hills. Bitch was snow hill. Fucking worst. Indiana is the worst state in its own country. But even in Indiana they found gold and it became like Qatar or some shit. They just, you know, they found oil. They felt like some crazy new patch or oil and all of a sudden they started building the world's tallest building there and all the same kind of shit they do in Dubai. We do buy apparently is insane.

And plus I think Anthony [inaudible], Anthony [inaudible], who I have to give his props too.

Speaker 1:          00:54          He's probably the reason why I started a podcast. It was, first of all, because he was a part of opiate Anthony, which was the first time I ever thought like, I really liked doing radio or the way opie and Anthony did it. It was great. We would come in you, you have done it too, right? Yeah, but I remember first doing it going, wow, am I the shitty episode? Because no one really talked a lot. We just had fun. I know. I took me a minute. Oh, they just decided to do what they wanted to do with radio. I just thought I was boring because there's no bells and whistles and fake laughs and to this day I don't think opie and Anthony got the credit that it deserved because I think that they let us, they let us, they're like, they're the best show. They were the best show ever that don't exist anymore, unfortunately.

Norton is still doing his thing with Sam and Norton does a thing with the UFC too. He does UFC on sensor with Matt Serra, which is hilarious. And Norton also does the chip chip person podcasts. He does all that on his own now. Yeah. I've never listened to it, but I've, I've been tweeted about it enough to know that it's a character. It's hilarious. It's so uncomfortable. It's so good. It's one of my favorite things that he does. It's fucking amazing. You want to see a video of it? Go coat. Now we're in a a live broadcast. No, but I'll pull it up sometimes. I hated making people listen to 30 seconds of Cha Cha Cha. There was good. I liked it. Good. Let people know. A lot of people don't know. There's a lot of shit people don't know.
