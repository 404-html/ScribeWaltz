Speaker 1:          00:00          It seems early that early to push a lawn mower. That's not, I didn't have a lawnmower job when I was 11. That seems early. No, I don't think so. I think it's, you know, you tell them where not to put their feet in their hands and they're good. Let the little fella have a life kind of involved in sports. They will play, they will play a lot of Lacrosse. You play a lot of basketball. They shovel snow yet. Swim team. Yeah. They shovel snow. Get out there. The 10 year old, the eight year olds shovel snow during the winter, six year olds like, yeah. Mugs. He's not doing a lot. Got It. Figured out a way out of this shit. He's going to be management. I think that's what he's gonna do. He's gonna be management somehow. Uh, but uh, yeah. The, the, the work ethic.

Speaker 1:          00:38          I think you're absolutely right. I mean we, every, every generation, right? Like my parents wanted it to be easier for me and my brothers. Right. And their parents, I'm sure want it to be easier for them, right. Nobody. And so you do that, but eventually you get to diminishing returns because it becomes so easy. And you know, the kids forget what it is like to actually have to work for something to compete and to compete. And you know, we can't all, it's, it's like that I saw some story, not that I troll the social media, but there was a story that popped up that, uh, some community, uh, they had a cheer squad tryout and one of the girls didn't make it on cheer squad. I didn't even know what cheer squad, I guess the cheerleaders and the mom was upset and so she went and complained. And so the school decision was that everybody who tried out gets to be on this squad. Yeah. You can imagine what that looks like. That's a,

Speaker 2:          01:35          you got to teach kids the opposite. That if you didn't do good enough, you need to figure out what you did wrong and go back and improve and work on it. And then if you do get in next year, you'll get an amazing feeling of accomplishment rather than an amazing feeling of entitlement. Right. You, you belong in everything you try out for. Well, that's going to be a big fat wake up call when you go out to compete in the workforce.

Speaker 1:          01:58          Right. Nobody's going to, oh my God, nobody, nobody's going to cut you any slack. Theoretical fully. Yeah, but no, that's, that's, that's right. The idea that, you know, you got to you, I mean it's like my, my two older boys who are people thinking, okay, Mike's now talking about his kids all the time. Uh, my two little boys, I have gotten to the point now where the sports thing and they play and if they don't play well, they sit right. Because earlier than that, you know, everybody plays right. It's equal playing time. You know, that's what you typically go get the coaches here and that's a good thing. They little kids are learning how to play the game of where to stand and all the rest of it. So, but then they get to a certain point, it becomes merit based or it should anyway, which is how it works in Idaho basically, at least with the teams that were we were associated with, is that if you're, if you don't play that well then maybe you don't make the team.

Speaker 1:          02:42          And if you made the team and you're not playing as well as the other kids and you're sitting on the bench. And so you know, my kids, you don't know when it first started happening, you know, they were just, they were complaining, you know, like, you know, screw it, I'm not getting any playing time. And I'm thinking, well, okay, what's the next part of that thought process that you need to work your way through? If you're not getting enough playing time, it's because you're not what planning as well as you should be compared to the other kids. Therefore, what do you need to do? So you have to walk them through this process. And that's okay because kids don't know this stuff inherently. Maybe. And so you teach them that, but you don't teach them that while you're, you're right. Why don't you try a different sport, or you know, or you're right, we should talk to the coach about your parents.

Speaker 2:          03:21          They're making it too difficult for the children and they're not having a good time. And it should be about companionship and it shouldn't be about competition. Well, you're setting your kid up for failure because it can be about both. It can be about companionship, but also about competition and, right. Oops. Look, the world's competition, it's filled with it. If you're not competing, if you're, if you just decide you don't want to have anything to do with competition, that's your choice. But if you engage in something that does require competition, you want special access. Right?

Speaker 1:          03:52          Right, right. It does. Yeah. If you don't, if you're not that nature, if you don't have that competitive side of you and okay, fine, but then don't go through the rest of the life thinking what? Just because life is a competition, which you know, may upset you when you find that out, that you don't get special dispensation just because you're not a competitive person. It does it. Yeah. So I agree with it. Participation Trophies, all the nonsense that's going on today. Well, I was, I was, uh, I was walking, one of my boys, the oldest went off the off the lacrosse field not too long ago. And he said, how'd I do? And I said, well, you could've done better. You could have played harder. He just wasn't into it. Right. He was tired or whatever. So he kind of looked at me and I didn't realize I was walking and there were some parents around me.

Speaker 1:          04:34          And as we were walking across the field, and so he kind of looks at me and I knew what he was thinking, which is Dan, that's not right. And so I looked at her, I said, do you want me to be honest with you and you want me to just stand here and blow smoke up your ass? And I found out afterwards that a couple of parents who are upset about the fact that I would say that, but he knew exactly what I meant. And he said, now you should be honest. And I said, well, the parents were upset at you for being honest. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And, and you know, it'd be fair Muggsy the youngest one got called in for, uh, uh, I tell you this, he got caught if using the word Douche bag one time, but a funnier, funnier one was when he and two of his buddies who shall not be named, who were out in the playground not too long ago and there was sitting down in, they're playing some game, right?

Speaker 1:          05:16          It was recess. And all the kids, all the different grades are out there running around. And everybody knows my little kid, you know, Mugsy he's like the mayor of the town. He's, he's just a jolly happy guy. He's got, he's got us, he's going to be the guy that takes 10 years to get out of college. Right? And so he, he and his two little buddies are sitting there, they're playing some game where they got to count with their fingers. So at one point, Jack has the number one and he puts up a finger, right? And one of the other kids starts laughing and cause he's got an older brother who told them what it means. So he tells me what he means. So they start shouting this out, right? And this word, they start shouting and well a couple of the older kids, well by any here, here, these three kids know six year olds yelling and laughing up.

Speaker 1:          05:53          Roy is like, cause I think it's the funniest stuck in thing they've ever heard. And so they get called into the principal. Well what happens next? I have to find out about this, right? So now they notify the parents and know in middle of the principal's laughing when they, when they're telling the story. But now I have to have a conversation with Mugsy when, when I come home. So I come home and I said, monkey, anything happened today? And he goes, Nah, nothing happened. And you walked right by me. And I said, wait, wait, wait, come back here. I said, did you get called into the principal's? He goes, oh yeah. He said, we were, let me see. We were playing on the playground and I went like this. And you know what this means? I said, no, I don't need to know. And I look out of the corner of my eye, see his two older brothers, like around the corner just waiting because they know he's gonna get his ass kicked right for, for this.

Speaker 1:          06:37          And they're just like, they can't wait. And so I said, no, I don't need to know what it is. Just don't do it again. Whatever you do, don't do it again. And he goes, no, no, no, no. You got to know what this means. He's really intent on it. And so I said, and he's two other boys skirts. I go, they're like, oh, he's going to get so much it. And I said, all right, what does it mean? And I had no idea what he was going to say, but what he did say was mother Fucker, and that's what they were yelling on the playground. All three of them at the top of their lungs, Gel mother fuckers six that's six years old. That's a door. And I started laughing and the two other boys walked away, disgusted that I was laughing. And that's the end of my story.

Speaker 1:          07:18          So they're great kids. So how do you take that gene? You put it back in the bottle, do you know? You know, you just say don't use it all started screaming motherfucker and there, there's not much you can do. Throwing their finger up in there. It's hard to do. I mean, I find myself having to constantly catch myself. I'll, I'll say, you know, things like, hey, you'll quit jackass and around, and then I'll think, okay, I probably shouldn't say that, but that's fun. I can't get, you know, my dad was the greatest guy I've ever known in my life and he swore and I, it didn't scare me in any way. I don't have a problem with it. It's part of what I do for a living. But when I was a wa I was, we were in, we were skiing with my, uh, youngest daughter who was three and a, we're packing up the stuff and she forgot to pack her helmet and a helmet wasn't packed in the thing. And she looks down at her luggage. She looks down at the helm and she goes, Oh shit, this is something adorable. But she was three at the time, about a three year old sage. Let's see if she could get together with Mugsy. Then she could have said Shit and you could have said what happened and she could said, I forgot my mother fucking helmet.

Speaker 1:          08:29          Then she's got a completely sentenced. I mean, there's something really cute about kid's swearing. It's just adorable. We try to tell them, you know, don't, don't, yeah, we try to teach him the basics. Don't swear. If you can have, the problem is they're going to, it seems so attractive. You know what to do because they're not supposed to do it. And when no one's around, like, you know what I heard, I remember I found a new word starts with a C. Yeah. Oh, you know they're doing it. Yeah. What's that one? Oh God, yeah. Well, we, we learned everything we learned from older brothers. Right? Or from friends who had older brothers, but it was, it was a slower process, right. Because we didn't have the internet and all that crap. Right. And, and so I think what you, you learned a lot. It took a little bit longer.

Speaker 1:          09:12          You know, to learn, like, I don't think I've really rolled out douchebag till I was probably 12, maybe 13. Well, we were talking yesterday about, um, access to the Internet where kids see so much more and hear so much more today. Like there especially like violent images and their access to terrible things. And there's just so much that if you leave a kid alone with a computer or a phone that's online, oh yeah. Yeah. They're just going to find out everything about the world way before the little brains are ready. No, you can't do it. You've got it. You've gotta be, you gotta lock it down, right. I mean, it's a good thing they got to learn the technology, unlike what I apparently would, I apparently did. I'm gonna leave my, my, uh, my watch here for you since I don't know how to use it, but a year, are you going to let them get online?
