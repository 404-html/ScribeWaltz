Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience, if you always like that. I was reading something really interesting where they were saying that they are are fucking up the brand because they've put them into discount stores that they're trying to raise the sails and by raising the sales they put them in a discount stores. By putting them in the discount stores, they're going to change the way people look at the brand. It's not going to be worth as much. That's probably very realistic, man. That's very interesting. Weird people think so weird and know like if you saw a pair of Nike's at a discount store, would you like Google folk? Nokia were like, and what that what that means zero to me.

Speaker 2:          00:34          Yeah. No, and they hit mean in Nike has a outlet stores, which is like discount. Yes. You know, so that's, that's kind of weird, but it is true about how, I mean the other one is like that big baller brand there basically attempting to compete in the apparel

Speaker 1:          00:49          world. Lavar Ball, right? Yeah. That's the guy that got in that crazy thing because his son was arrested in China for shoplifting the China. He was in China. Yeah, he was shoplifting. And then Trump says he got 'em out and the dad says he didn't get them out. Yeah, it's that, that's him then. And then the dad is, you know, Trump's calling the data.

Speaker 2:          01:09          What happened? That trumps, I mean well that guy is very brash Lavar ball. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. But I mean I think you know that guy knows what he's doing man. As far as, as far as PR, definitely. He knows he's going to say some wild shit and he knows people are going to be like, oh my God, what did he say? And then he knows that that gets him more press and like it, it kind of just feeds itself and people act like he believed the fucking crazy shit that asshole just said. And he's like, yeah, that's what I do. And that's why you keep putting me on the show like Trump when he was running for prom 100% it's the same school of thought. And now though that guy, so he has a son named Lonzo plays for the Lakers. Who's a first round, first round draft pick, like a, a top tier player from Ucla.

Speaker 2:          01:54          Then his other son was two more sons. One of them was on Ucla team this year, got arrested for shoplifting in China. If he hadn't been released, if it wasn't high politically, you know, highly publicized thing. He definitely could have gone to jail for a while in China. They don't fuck around, you know, so, but anyways, when he got out and came back Lavar pulled him from like from school, from Ucla and also pulled his 16 year old son at a high school and flew them to Lithuania where they're now playing. Both of them were playing professional basketball in Lithuania and professional professional class quotes. Jamie did the air quotes. It's got to be in big air quotes for sure. Well, I mean there's definitely some, some good players that come out of there, but it's like, um, I mean it is a circus over there.

Speaker 2:          02:43          If you see like how it was when they arrived, it was like, it's like some, it's crazy. The reception, you know, what is he trying to do now? He's trying to start some new league. He's trying to do a couple things. He started a brand big baller brand and they know that's like ball and beaten and came out with these shoes. They're basically $500 retail sneakers. And if you're like, that's expensive. He's like, cause you're not a big baller bitch. That's why not. That's like what are they like made by a real organization? Well Adidas, no, no, no, no, no. They're not made by definitely not any. And by the way, the sun that's in the MBA turned down real money, like real fucking money because he was like, I the, the father demanded that you basically pay to develop this brand from the big uh, apparel.

Speaker 2:          03:31          And the guy's like, give us like a billion dollar contract and like develop this brand. What? And they were like, no, we're not doing that. And he's like, well then we're not even gonna talk to you about endorsing my science. Seriously. 100% yes. Then now he's had like, there's so much a conversation about the brand that he's definitely elevated. Like the awareness of it. What? We don't know what nobody knows is like, to what level are they actually selling this apparel? You know, like are they, because they have everything, they have shirts and shoes they're getting, they just got it rated an f by the better business. Right around their shoes are not the ones they sold the previous sold a bunch of shoes and there's like the ones that people are getting are not what they bought. So people are pissed. There's no way to return or the fun.

Speaker 2:          04:19          Yeah. Great fun to or exchange them. Yeah. And they're just telling people they're literally, I think I read that the customer service people told you, you, oh, you must be a brook baller then. Yeah. You're not satisfied. Yeah. That's literally what it, oh my God. But he's also, I mean he's, so anyways, he stays, he's about, he took these kids to Lithuania, they're going to play basketball. He's like, he basically says they're going to be on the Lakers when my three sons are going to be Lakers. Right. So, and we have no idea really realistically whether the two younger sons even have, we don't know. To be fair, whether they're going to be MBA quality players yet, you know, like the clearly one is the one is on the Lakers, but so we don't know if that's going to pan out in any way, shape or form.

Speaker 2:          05:00          He also talked about developing a league for like kids that are coming out of high school that don't want to go to college and play in a league where they get paid like a salary, you know, a reasonable salary, which is, uh, an an idea that a lot of people think is fascinating. I don't know logistically whether he could pull that off. You know, that's kind of a, I got to know for sure. Right? I mean, but, but the idea is one that people have talked about for years because college athletes generate a lot of revenue
