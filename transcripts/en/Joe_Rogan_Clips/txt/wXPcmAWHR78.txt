Speaker 1:          00:00          You know what to keep, what concerns me is, uh, this, the rise of people that think that everyone owes them something. Sure. You know, that's, that's, that's the weird one. Like we were talking about AOC who, you know, she seems like a nice girls cause looking woman. She's young, she's got energy, she wants to do good things. She wants to do some good ones. But I saw the one thing that said give money to people who are unable or unwilling to work. Yeah. That's the saw that, and I'm like going to work. Well it's not in, they pulled that out. They pulled that part out. The unwilling park in her unable to work makes total sense. You know, we would, as a community, we should take care of the people. Most of the people that are now in comedy or unable to work, most of us, most of us, yes.

Speaker 1:          00:42          This is the only thing we can do. But her thing was a weird one because that, that thing, unwilling to work. It's like, hey, hey, hey. He just, he just crossed over into crazy town like this is, but that means that crazy town was always in the back. You always had that. Yeah. When you put that on paper. Yeah. That means this is something that's been discussed, like part of the appeal and she just, I don't know how influential she wasn't getting Amazon to drop out in New York, but I live in Queens, so everyone is paranoid. Amazon was coming. That was a Bagel. I, no carbs, no good. But I was in a Bagel shop. I gave up dairy two weeks ago, turning it around, trying to get around. I was in a Bagel shop. It was paranoid about Amazon. Amazon's gonna come, we're all going to get priced out of our little shoe box.

Speaker 1:          01:23          Is it we live in or the, some of the people that own those shoe boxes were like, I'm a millionaire now because Amazon's coming and the, but here's the thing, it's hard to have a rational discussion about inequality right now because in a place like New York City, it's so expensive to live. And the reason for that is that it's a destination for like foreign capital. So essentially a lot of the buildings in New York City, foreign people buy apartments, they don't live in them. They use it to like launder money and they buy them not even under their real name. They buy them under the name of a Shell Corp like an LLC and then they have like these investments and it really makes everything insanely expensive. That's what's making everything. That's what's making a lot of real estate in New York City. Expensive. What do you what like what if you got to get us, what percentage of like expensive apartments are owned by, I'll tell you, between 2008 and 2014 I think 50% of apartments going into contract were cause I do a shell, but I, I used to be a double decker tour guide in New York City and so I do a show, like a funny comedy show where I take, I sell tickets, I put people on a tour bus and then we'd go around to these buildings, just scream at these buildings.

Speaker 1:          02:26          It's fun. It should be illegal, but it's fun and, and no one cares because they're not home. Because there somewhere, I mean if Hillary, if you look at who owns these buildings is a guy who like is maybe a guy who owns a mining company and he poisoned to river in Zambia. The a lot of these guys who are doing things they shouldn't be doing and they want to stash their money in real estate. London is insane. It's more expensive than New York because London is all essentially shell corporations. You know these phantom buyers buying up real estate in London, in New York, so you have people in New York that know the system is fucked. They know the markets being artificially manipulated. Bloomberg thought it was great. Bloomberg is, we want all the billionaires. He said it. That was his quote. We want all of the bay.

Speaker 1:          03:07          It's like some of those billionaires have done things that would make you, would keep you up at night. They've numbers like bring them in. They eat shrimp and steak. They've got a Peter Luger's. We love him as a businessman, right? That's the thing. So people get fed up with this and dude, and when I was, had my tour bus, people would get on from regular places like Pennsylvania and I would just point and go 10 million, 20 million, 30 million. These people just shift uncomfortably in their seats. Like what the Hell's going on here? This is the, you know, I saw Trump getting elected during those tours because I'm like $100 million and they're like sitting there like, what? I can't afford a knee operation. Well, the idea that Trump's not a part of that as he listen in his bit, his building was a huge destination. Russians love his building.

Speaker 1:          03:53          They love it. They love a brand name. They love the plaza, they love his building. And a lot of interesting characters lived in Trump tower. Didn't they take the Trump tower name off of it in New York? Yeah. Wasn't, no, it was one of the buildings where the, the people that own the co op decided to take the name off of it. Maybe there's a lot of shitty like Trump nursing homes to live in in New York. Oh yes. Nursing homes. You know those elderly people getting beaten. It's hard, Joe, you know, they're getting fleeced. The beaten. You go by, you see like Trump pavilion. It's like a Soviet era architecture. Horrible like old age home that's been there since the 70s and I'm like, man, I feel for the people in there, the screams of must other than New York condo votes to remove Trump from name. Yeah, New York City condominium on Thursday, we removed president Trump's name from the buildings facade.

Speaker 1:          04:46          The second time at four months, his name has been removed from a condo in the city. 55% of Trump plays condo owners at 120 Riverside Boulevard in Manhattan. Voted in favor of removing the large sign above the front door. The buildings. I mean that crazy. Who Cares? These are self important people, but when care is, they're worried about their secure. Oh, that's a good point. Yeah. I think if you try to sell it and it's Trump place and you know you're going to eliminate 50% of your buyers dictators that are buying those apartments, I think it's great. They die. Maybe they don't. Maybe they're like, you know, this is probably, we'll probably go down the street to this no name building, we'll be better off. But a lot of his condos were sold to, you know, Mafia and you know, the Russian business guys, and he's always hide that, you know, he did deals.

Speaker 1:          05:34          It was his firm located in Trump tower called Bay rock financial, which was a, it was headed by this guy, Felix Sader. Felix Sater was a guy that the FBI, uh, convicted in like a Russian pump and dump stock scam. And he worked in Trump tower with Trump. Like he worked very closely with Trump and Felix had like informed, I think on the Russian mob for the feds and the feds kind of let him earn. And so Trump has had this of shady connections forever. Wow. And I don't know if that means that he's ness. I don't think he's an asset or of Putin or anything like that. I don't believe that. I think that's kind of just, you know, I think it's, a lot of people would like to believe that, but he's a shady guy. So if you have all these people pouring over his business deals for the last 50 years, it can't be good.
