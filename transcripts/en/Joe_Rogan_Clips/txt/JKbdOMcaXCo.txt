Speaker 1:          00:00          Are Robots going to destroy us? That's a very good question and that's something that Elon Musk is actually scared of. Really? Yeah. He stopped a little, Deval says it's going to happen. He's a very intelligent guy to just, besides making a good record, he talks about us essentially replacing each other where robots soon. It's entirely possible. The Way Elon Musk looks at it is that he's, he was trying to warn people, but they weren't listening and that there's no telling how powerful they could get once they become sentient, once they start taking control of their own destiny and creating new robots and, and just deciding whether or not we live or die and how they're going to run things, they're essentially, they're going to become a life form, an artificial life form that's way fucking smarter than us. Yeah. And he's saying, do you think it's smart to army things they've seen?

Speaker 1:          00:44          It's smart to make this like he's looking at in terms of, uh, he's the tip of the spear. Right. And it comes to technology and an implementation of it. I mean, think about who this guy is, right. If he's the one who's telling you everybody's kind of slow the fuck down. This is dangerous. You literally might be making a terminator movie here. You literally might be making a terminator movie. Yeah, we have to worry because we, when were you were saying that you think we evolved from monkeys? We evolved from some lower thing. Well, the idea is that we got to keep going. Well, if we might hit a biological bottleneck and that might be the whole convergence of humans and technology, that might be what it's all about. Like biologically this system doesn't move fast enough, but if we can transcend this and move into some sort of a digital life, that life, we can accelerate all of the innovation, all of the improvements in insane numbers like years traveled through time change the fucking, the nature of life itself.

Speaker 1:          01:38          That's going to probably be one of the stages of our future. Whether it's a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand years from now. It seems to me like with this adoption of science and into our daily lives in terms of like the technologies that we're all addicted to, phones and tablets and all these different things often say, he says that we're a Cyborg is already in your extension. These are, this is just a rudimentary way. Yeah, he's ready for sure. Right. You already living people already living through this. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And he's also coming out with something called neuro link. I don't exactly know what it was. He was very vague about it, but he was saying he was going to change the bandwidth to change your, your like your ability to access information and people are going to wear it. You know where this thing on your head, it's going to literally charge up your fucking brain.

Speaker 1:          02:20          Some strange, strange days. He couldn't, he couldn't explain too much about it, but he was saying it was gonna come out in a few months. Like what nef fuck man were we were, you know, 30 or 40 years away from being unrecognizable. That's what I think. I think we're 30 or 40 years away from being living in. What's it look the time living in a virtual world, half the time live in an augmented world. I think people are going to exist in these weird worlds where it feels real and isn't. I think they're going to come out with programs that are fun at first, but then become life consuming. Where you put on these fucking goggles and this suit and you go into this world and you live with these in and interact. We touch each other, but no one's there physically, but you feel like you are and it's magical.

Speaker 1:          03:04          You're like, you're living in Avatar, you're on Pandora. You're hanging out with the blue people. Gotcha. Yeah. You with the Navi, that shit could happen. You could literally get to a point where you believe you were there or we could be there now. We could be there. Yeah. That's a sneaky, sneaky argument, right? Yeah, but that, that's, that's the truth of it all. It is a truth. Right? It could be. We could be there. We could be a part of a simulation. Yeah. That's another thing that you want on my son. I'm like, God damn it. You're supposed to say no. You're supposed to say no. It's impossible. It could all be fake. Yeah. Deja. Could peach us a glitch? Yeah, sure. So I just try to live like my grandpa's said, just enjoy a regular shit as much as you can.
