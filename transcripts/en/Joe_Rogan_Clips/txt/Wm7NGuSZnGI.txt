Speaker 1:          00:00          But what would doctor heard is talking about is in the first chapter of the book, which I guess you haven't read.

Speaker 2:          00:05          Um, and I really should have a copy for it. Stupid of me. Um, I got a copy of my bag. So that's really smart though.

Speaker 1:          00:18          So this is fascinating to me. The, the British colonized India, and they set up what they call lunatic asylum was really psychiatric hospitals, sort of very primitive psychiatric hospitals. And they were really initially for soldiers in the Indian army and they were run by British doctors. And what these doctors really as early as like the lead 1850s, 1860s noticed was that a lot of the people who showed up in these hospitals were showing up with Cannop, what they called Ganja. Actually in India, it's called Ganja or bong, which is a very weak preparation of a, of, of basically, uh, uh, uh, Indian hemp, just sort of low grade cannabis. Um, and so, and so they started counting and they realized the 20 to 30% of the people who were coming to asylums were heavy cannabis users. And that was way more than alcohol. It's more than opium. And it's really fascinating. Doctor named, uh, George Francis William Humans wrote a book in 1908 and he looked at the evidence and, and it is amazing to hear how he described schizophrenia, how he describes cannabis, how he describes the cases of violence around cannabis. It's like, it's like any psychiatrist today. Certainly any forensic psychiatrists like my wife would, would like, everything in the book would ring completely true. And it was so fascinating to me to stumble on this and realize this is something people have been talking about for more than a hundred years. So

Speaker 2:          01:44          could we agree that there are some people where cannabis is not a good idea? Absolutely. Right. We can agree that, I think we all agree. We're also agree that some people can't eat peanuts. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Right. And yeah, it's not the same thing though, but yeah. You know why peanuts kill you? That's, yeah, it's more dangerous. So these like second 600 a year. Yeah. People die from peanuts. So I think more people die from cameras as a result of that homicide and the suicide. Okay. Well, there's no correlation. There's no paper that I know somebody has got to do the work. Wait a minute. But why are you saying that then? Because I've looked at enough data to tell me you think marijuana is causing homicides. Oh yeah. This is what the book is about. But in how so and what was it causes paranoia and psychosis in people. And paranoid psychosis are huge risks for homicide and schizophrenia. Studies that refute that was noticeable starting. No studies that refute that. Paranoia and psychosis are huge risks for homicide. Schizophrenia is a 20 x 20 times Joe. Well Jamie, I sent you a document, uh, yesterday. I mean there's, there's multiple studies that show that, you know, marijuana laws are not associated with any type of violence. Marijuana law was just talking about the drug.

Speaker 1:          03:00          So the use of the drug, which could possibly trigger psychosis, psychosis and schizophrenia, which are correlated with murder. Is that what you're saying? They're not correlated their triggers. That's absolute fact triggers because of the paranoia and delusions and you think that someone's out to get you and they're not. Absolutely. I mean the, the out of the numbers, the, okay, so the numbers are, if you're, if you're have a diagnosis of schizophrenia, uh, you are 20 times as likely to commit. Homicide is somebody who's healthy. Now it's actually worse than that for cannabis. Okay? And here's why. What, so the National Alliance for mental illness and the mental illness address advocacy groups hate talking about this, why they hate talking about it obviously, because it stigmatizes people with mental illness. So what they say, and this is true, is if you have a diagnosis, but you're taking your anti-psychotics, even though the side effects might be unpleasant, you're in treatment, you're, you're, you're not using recreational drugs.

Speaker 1:          03:52          Your risk for violence isn't that high. It's not that much higher than a healthy person. Okay? And you know, fortunately healthy people don't commit murder that often. The problem is if you've, if you think about the math for half a second, if there's this one group of people who don't have a very high risk for murder or serious violence, who, because they're not using, because they're on anti psychotics, it means that the excess risk in the people who are using and who's untrue, psychosis is untreated. It must be spectacularly high. And the numbers bear that out. So, so there's a really good study from last year, 2018 it's small group of patients in, um, in Switzerland. Switzerland is a safe country, has a low base crime rate, but 50% of the people who were using cannabis and had psychosis over a three year period committed violence in that group of people. That's mostly 20 somethings.

Speaker 2:          04:46          Well, you know, there's, there's a study here and I just sent it to, uh, Jamie and it's, it's titled, um, risk factors for violence in psychosis, a systemic review and Meta analysis of 110 studies. So, you know, that's quite a few studies. Okay. So, um, you know, let me just, just read a part of it out too. So violence was strongly associate with a history of polysubstance abuse, strongly associate with diagnosis code, mid substance use disorder and recent substance misuse and moderately associate with it. History of alcohols misuse, a history of substance misuse, uh, recent alcohol misuse, recent drug misuse and a history of drug misuse. It was unclear if there was an association between violence and a history of cannabis misuse. So again, this is 110 studies, uh, they very carefully looked at at all of the different risk factors as to what could trigger violence. Just let me finish Alex. And what they said again, it was unclear if there was an association between violence and a history of cannabis misuse. Right? So that's 110 studies. So

Speaker 1:          05:53          cannabis use in there is going to get locked in with poly substance use because a lot of people use are going to be using other drugs. Uh, Holly substance means multiple substance, alcohol, cannabis, exactly. Everything else was found to have significant statistical signal. And I have not just mine to study that a doctor heard assignment. I'd like to look at it without looking at it. I can't push back as hard as I would like. What I can tell you is that I have many studies in the book that show that cannabis use is associated with violence in people with psychosis. Okay. And more broadly, it's associated with violence in the general population in large studies, in studies of high school students and bullying in studies of people who were vacationing in Ibiza, in, in, in studies of young men in China and the UK. There are big studies out there that show cannabis use is associated with violence, Ibiza, Ibiza.

Speaker 2:          06:53          It's been a busy place. Let's say of ether. I got grilled over there for that. They get manager, I suppose to just said it, some dignitary or royal person had a lisp. Right? Isn't that how it all starts at true? Yeah. Yeah. I believe so. Noted. Yeah. The way the people in Spain pronounce words was directly affected by this one person apparently. But um, so this, uh, these, this correlation, um, between people that have schizophrenia and using cannabis, how do you, is schizophrenia a diagnosis? It's purely based on behavior

Speaker 1:          07:37          basically. Yes. It's a clinic. There's no blood test can do a brain scan. It's basically how you behave and, and what'd you tell the doctor about how you're feeling

Speaker 2:          07:44          and then what about our message? Our eyes are, it's very subjective because you're, you're asking someone basically a series of questions. I mean, it's no different than, you know, depression really. I mean, you, you just, just asking someone a series of questions and then you know, based upon that, which is very subjective than you're going to make a clinical decision. Whereas when it's like a blood test, like if someone, you know, passes, uh, you know, a certain amount of hemoglobin A1c, you know, depending on which chart you're looking at, then you're going to call that person pre diabetic or diabetic. But, you know, unfortunately we just don't have those objective measurements. And again, that's why, you know, Alex was saying earlier that, um, that, you know, the, uh, they couldn't really figure out, you know, how many people in the United States had had schizophrenia. And I understand that.

Speaker 2:          08:28          But at the same time too, I mean, it's okay to, to adjust, you know, the way that you diagnose someone over the course of the years and you learn things because, you know, you could easily say that almost everyone has some type of mental illness and people should understand that, you know, there's seven different basic human emotions. You know, I've talked to this for, it's, there's, there's anger, there's contempt. Uh, there's, there's discuss, there's fear, sadness and happiness. That's seven. So, you know, depending on which way surprise goes. I mean, six out of those seven are, are negative, right? Because we're wired to basically detect threats. So, you know, um, w when we're, we're making, you know, the, all these diagnoses, I think we have to be careful because, you know, some people are calling themselves to press and some people are calling themselves anxious when really, you know, they're just not dealing with basic human emotions that they need to understand and need to deal with.

Speaker 2:          09:22          Like, people are getting angry about being angry or like depressed about being depressed. They, if you feel one of these emotions, just kind of sit with it and just kind of reflect on it. And I think, you know, that's a much, much better way to kind of kind of tea to tease things out. But you know, to come back to my original point, I think that, you know, more people are understanding that um, you know, we don't just need to give out a pill for everything and that, you know, everyone shouldn't just be labeled as having a mental health diagnosis because if things just keep going the way they are, you know what, what's, by 2040 it's going to be like 50% of people are going to have like a mental health disorder. So like people just need to understand that life is hard. You got to deal with these emotions. Sometimes it's not that big of a deal. And that's why for subs, for some folks, and that's why I'm such a big thing of, of Jordan Peterson because you know, he's, he's, he's kind of tough on people.

Speaker 3:          10:12          Let me stop and shook his Jordan Peterson was on Ssri is for years. Yeah. That's interesting. Yeah, it was a long, long time. I mean like for a long, long time as was his family. And what's crazy about him, it was what got him off is a carnivore diet diet where he only eats meat with salt and drinks water and the healthier than he's ever been in his life. And that is a, another massively controversial subject. Let me push back a little bit because I think people as controversial as the book has been about, uh, about cannabis and psychosis, this violence issue is even more controversial. And obviously for, for a fair number of people, it doesn't really, it doesn't sync with the stereotype and it doesn't say it with how they've experienced cannabis use. Right. So I think, I think alcohol's a really interesting comparison.

Speaker 3:          11:04          Sorry, the Canadian, well you have to go national. We were talking about, my wife's actually from new family. So you feel age as an understand marijuana recently and decided to say, you can't say Newfoundland trained myself to say that way. You're telling me I'm wrong. Just pulled up. Marijuana use increases violent behavior. 50 year study finds casual link between cannabis and subsequent violent behavior. A new research published, uh, online in advance of print of the journal. It's like a psychological medicine concludes the continued use of cannabis causes violent behavior as a direct result of changes in brain function that are caused by smoking weed. Over many years, researchers have long debated a possible link between the use of and violent crime in contrast to alcohol, meth, and many other illegal drugs. The mellowing effects of cannabis scene unsuited to promoting violent behavior. However, ample, ample previous research has linked marijuana use to increased violent behavior. The sticky problem in such studies are that many confounding factors, cofounding factors, uh, involved in interpreting this correlation. So, so look, okay, it is very difficult to determine whether or not any statistical correlation between marijuana use and violent behavior, our, uh, cash causally linked, or instead the two associated, uh, or instead the two are associated through some other factors such as socioeconomic status, personality traits are many other variables that are related to the propensity to use marijuana.

Speaker 4:          12:41          MMM.

Speaker 1:          12:42          So I, I think that's a fairly good summary of the, of, of the issues. What's up James?

Speaker 4:          12:47          The study came from 411 boys who were born in 1953 in London, 97% of which were Caucasian. And all of them are raised in two parent households. So,

Speaker 1:          12:59          so, you know, so those people are relatively stable if they're the two family, two parent households to hand parents beat to shit. No, it's possible. But so, so let me so, so, so I think the alcohol comparison is again, a good one because anybody who's ever been in a bar at 9:00 PM and gone back at 2:00 AM knows that alcohol disinhibit people, right. It causes fights, right. It, it makes people loud. It makes a lot of fucking too. It's good and bad. I don't know if that's good. I mean sometimes it's alcohol and sex are a terrible idea. It certainly causes some sexual violence. Sure. Okay. But at the same time, everybody knows that you can have a drink. You know, you can have a beer at the back of your barbecue, you can have glass of wine. It doesn't mean that you're going to get in a fight and you actually might enhance your conversation, social lubricant, all that good stuff, good stuff.

Speaker 1:          13:53          And you might even know people. I mean, I do know people who I would say have a problem with drinking. Okay. But it's mostly they're sitting at home drinking scotch, watching baseball until they fall asleep that night. Now that's obviously not a healthy way to use alcohol, but it doesn't make them violent. But we know on a population basis that alcohol causes violence. It causes drunk driving, it causes problems. And it said that in this study that I quoted earlier, but it's, it said that alcohol again, they didn't, or sorry, cannabis, they weren't sure. Right? So, okay, so this is again, I would like to read the paper that you're quoting from because I have so much other research. But here's, here's what I'm saying about cannabis. Okay. Cannabis for a lot of people. Yeah, they can just smoke it. And as people, you know, many people who have tweeted at me, the only thing I attacked was a bowl of Nachos. Right? And so and so that's true for some people, but that can be sent with the alcohol as well. That's exactly logical variables. There's so many studies that say that, that the cannabis laws have actually decreased Crimea.

Speaker 3:          14:54          She gotta let me finish. Let me finish. Let him finish.

Speaker 1:          14:56          Go ahead Alex. So, so even though for many people, cannabis isn't going to cause violence, that doesn't mean it can't cause violence in some people especially, or at least could be a factor of at least could be a factor, especially with the kind of violence that I am talking about. And then I write about in the book, which is again, so alcohol, it may be makes argument into a brawl. It makes a brawl into something where somebody picks up a stick. It makes that into something where somebody pulls out a knife, it escalates. Cannabis is different. Cannabis Causes Paranoia and psychosis. And it certainly causes us things temporarily, even if it doesn't cause them permanently. So a distortion in reality that could lead to you doing something terrible and it's usually to somebody you're not actually fighting with. It's a family member. The worst cases that I've, and I've really seen a lot of these cases are basically innocent family members who are just in the way.

Speaker 1:          15:52          When somebody loses touch with the reality and literally things like this, my 85 year old grandmother is going to kill me, so I better stab her to death first. That happens. It happens a lot. And if you look at the amount of violence that people with psychosis command on a population level basis, it looks like people with schizophrenia commit about six to 10% of all the murders in this country and it looks like people would sort of broader diff, more broadly defined psychosis. Again, bipolar with psychosis, other psychotic conditions, temporary psychosis, they might be responsible for as much as 20% of the violent crime in the United States. That's a lot of violent crime. And what I'm saying is that it is quite clear that drug use mediates that violent crime. In other words, if you're not using, you can keep your impulses in check, but when you do use, you become dangerous. Sure.

Speaker 3:          16:44          So when we're talking about biological variability, if we factor in schizophrenia, essentially what you're saying is that there are people that have schizophrenia that don't commit violence, but that they're much more likely to commit violence if you add some sort of psych medication, whether it's marijuana, whether it's something else, it perturbs reality for them. And particularly marijuana because hotbox bring down the recreational drugs, the worst cases of all our cannabis and a stimulant. Because to the they both like cocaine or meth. Exactly. Yeah. So when you get that, you get paranoid from two sources and you get, the only good thing about cannabis from this point of view is it kind of knocks people down a little bit, but meth brings them right back. So is it fair to say that what we don't know is that we don't know whether or not these people like this young band with his terrible story from Connecticut, we don't know whether or not he would have become a schizophrenia and exhibited those symptoms without the marijuana. We really don't know. But we do know he did with it. That's, that's correct. And, and what I would also say is that for somebody like that, and this is quite clear on a population level

Speaker 1:          17:50          basis with people with schizophrenia, is you've got to discourage them from using, really have to be discouraged because it brings out the worst. Right. And, and you know, somebody said this, uh, a friend of mine of old friend of mine from the New York Times said, so every time there's a hurricane people, some people on the right say, well you can't prove that global warming cause that one hurricane that would've happened anyway and he and there, right, you can't prove it and you can't prove that any one case of psychosis was caused by marijuana. But when you look at the big studies at the population level data, the association is really clear and everything points the same way and the synthetic cannabinoids k two and spice, those can clearly produce psychosis in people. And people with psychosis tend to slip back into it if they use at some point you got to start to say to yourself, why does everything go the same way?

Speaker 3:          18:36          Yeah. I also have a personal friend and I really didn't think about this guy, but there's another personal friend that I know that is a martial arts instructor that had a psychotic break. He became schizophrenia and he's a regular marijuana user and the people around him associated that with that. And in fact people that are regular cannabis users, we're trying to get them to stop using marijuana. If hired close to pricing on the edge, any use a little bit of cannabis for sure it can be Tyson can. This guy was not on the edge when I knew him, when I knew him, he was very rational, very rational. But something happened somewhere along the line was he, did he become a pretty heavy smoker over time? I do not know because we don't live in the same area anymore, but he got really heavily, uh, really heavily medicated and did some really crazy shit and want to being hospitalized.

Speaker 3:          19:25          And this was not the case before I'm in whatever it was that triggered him. I mean it, when I was around him, when he was younger, I would have said he's a total normal guy. And I would have never saw that coming. He was a heavy marijuana user, heavy, heavy. But I don't, I don't know how he's doing now. I hope he's okay. But we're, you know, we have mutual friends and uh, he became uh, schizophrenia and, and you know, you will see, you know, cases like that. But you know, when you do look at a lot of the larger data on, on cannabis and violence, I mean it's just, it's just not there. Like there's lots of data that suggests that, you know, medical marijuana laws for example, can actually have a decrease in overall. I mean, I think that's a study that says it gives no comfort to the people who lose their children because of the psychotropics. That's right.

Speaker 1:          20:13          And those studies are really bad. So the place that you can criticize a bad though, because there, because state level data is not great, the place the book has been criticized, right? Mandra.

Speaker 3:          20:21          There was a rand review though in 2013 and I mean that again that state by state conclude that marijuana use does not induce violent crime and the links between marijuana use and property client crime are thin right there. I think we all agree that marijuana use by itself with people that aren't schizophrenia probably does it induce violent crime, but with people that are schizophrenia or people where it triggers schizophrenia, it could potentially induce violent crime. My friend did not get violent, although he did do a violent thing. It wasn't to a person. I think. I think we have to be really careful because there's no, just like with diet, just like with food and you know like a allergies. All of these different variabilities when it comes to human beings, I think we have to be really, really careful about lumping all people together when it comes to how they get affected by various compounds.

Speaker 3:          21:14          So the state level, if you want, I'll, I'll, the place the book has been criticized in my mind sort of the most fairly is it points out that in the four states that legalized first, which is Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Colorado. Um, if you look at 2013 and then you compare that to 2017 murders and ag assaults, violent crime, um, are up substantially in those states and substantially more than in the u. S can I stop you there? But is there a possibility there's a correlation between organized crime because one of the things about selling marijuana is the people that have always been selling marijuana have been criminals. When you make things legal and estate, the people that were selling it illegal flock to that state. And that's been proven to be true, that there's, there's a direct correlation between people being robbed, that there was also a significant problem with credit cards and banks where everyone was having to do all their transactions with cash. There was a lot of violences was associated with marijuana in regards to that and also massive increase in population.

Speaker 2:          22:17          And that's the way, the reason why, why Trump has actually not really against cannabis in some ways, it's because he feels that if we have medical marijuana laws that, especially the states that are, that are border states, that the crime's gonna drop and drops a lot tremendously. And it has dropped. They did a study last year and it dropped over 50%. It's all around drop 7% in Arizona. And then again, you know, Benjamin Hanson, who, who's, who's an economist, the wrong data. So for his charge, okay, so he, he said that the murder rate did not demonstrate that marijuana legalization increases violence, then it may have actually demonstrated that legalization, it's slightly decreased fonts. And he thinks that, that the reason that there was an increase in the murder rate, particularly in Washington, is because there was a large income gap. They say that Washington has a 10th largest income gap, uh, in the United States. But that's why, how did that change corresponds to the murderer? Good question. I'm so, I haven't, you know, I didn't get to speak with Benjamin to about this, but sounds like confirmation bias. Well, he, I mean if that, that is one thing that has been shown to increase mental illness like we talked about and can definitely increase violence, is when you have an income gap.

Speaker 3:          23:33          But how's the income gap shifted? That directly correlates to the legalization of marijuana

Speaker 2:          23:38          because during the scene, because during the same period, the income gap, particularly in Washington in increased, so he that

Speaker 1:          23:46          the corresponding number, right? So he feels that, that it's likely more, more to that. And I mean he, I mean, I understand, but I mean you have to respect this guy, man. I respect him because I know what he did with his data and telling me what to do. This, this is maddening to me. Okay. Okay. Violent crime in those four states increased more rapidly than in the u s period between 2013 and 2017 who Jamie just posted the conjecture aside, no credible data exists. It supports a significant association between the increase in violent crime and marijuana legalization. Furthermore, study suggest that so far violent crime decreases in states with legalized medical marijuana until new research credibly suggest otherwise. The claim that a demonstratable link between the two exists will remain classified as false, so that's just not true. Okay. I know it's Snopes. Okay.

Speaker 1:          24:37          And I know we trust Snopes. I don't trust them that I was going to say that too, but they give all of their their sources. So again, by daily. So do you, are you, where are these sources? I've read this stuff and what's wrong with them here? Let me just go back to what I'm saying. Yeah, please do it. 2013 Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Alaska. There are 450 murders in those four states. There are 30,000 agg assault period. Okay. 2017 Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Alaska. There are 620 murders in those four states, that's an almost 40% increase. There are 38,000 agg assaults at the 25% increase. If you adjust for population, you still get big increases. In Denver, 2018 almost 70 murders. There were about 35 and 2013 Seattle, 27 2018 there were 34 35 murders. There were, I think 19 in 2013 these increases are real.

Speaker 1:          25:36          Okay. Now now, now, okay. Can we say that marijuana legalization caused those increases? We cannot yet there are other possibilities and you're, what are those? Um, well, one positive first of all, population did increase. It's also possible that these states, quote unquote imported violent crime and other ones that you've got a population of transients coming in in part because marijuana was legal and those people are likely to commit violent crime. And on top of that organized crime, people that are selling. Absolutely. There may have been some people who are exporting to, to Nebraska, to Minnesota, to other states. There's crime associated with that. But what I am saying is that unequivocally, unequivocally, the people who said legalization is going to decrease violent crime. And people did say that. And Cory booker in 2010 17 said it, he said that it actually had decreased violent crime in states that legalized.

Speaker 1:          26:28          And he didn't say it it randomly, he said it when he was introducing legislation to legalize marijuana on the federal level. Those people are wrong and they need to stop saying it. I know. And by the way that Oregon economists used, he used the wrong data set for his charts. Okay. He used, I used the real numbers. Okay. The FBI homicide numbers, he used numbers that include justifiable homicide, no police, because the FBI report that the murder rate went up 1% from 2015 to 2016 as compared to the nationwide, which one was 7.9% and then it dropped by 11.6% between 2016 and 20 seconds with numbers. Do not know what you're talking about. Okay. Those are FBI numbers of breeding and not know what you're talking about. The numbers are clear. Okay. I use them reading them right now. 2016 release of FBI uniform crime reports from Oregon.

Speaker 1:          27:22          Okay. Yes. Oregon. You're not reading the reports from the United States. You're picking one state for women showing something. We'll state that has legalized medical cannabis over the entire country from that time period too. So to pick those four states where marijuana was legalized, sort of Cherry picking, no, that it's picking every state where they were legalized and comes to the whole, to the whole country. The whole country, the whole country. You'll see similar. Is it a similar increase? That's what I'm trying to show. Yes. If I'm trying to pull back so we can see the hole. The hole. So first of all, that's a violent crime. Crime, a violent crime and that ag assaults, aren't they? No. So so, so the four categories of violent crime or murder, agg assault, robbery and rape. Rape has sort of gone sideways the last few years. Robberies actually have gone down.

Speaker 1:          28:10          It's murders and ag assaults that are interpersonal violent crime. Okay. Just to go back to this Oregon economist, because this maddens me, he used a Dataset that is not the standard data set to report. Murder rate is a difference. He used the data set that includes justifiable homicides, meaning I'm in my house, you come in, I shoot you and kill you. The police don't charge me with anything and police homicides but gets published. Let's not let an interrupt. Let me finish the, those two categories of crime are not likely to be impacted by cannabis use. Cops are not smoking when they're on patrol. I hope. And if you are using, you're very unlikely to have your murder viewed as justifiable homicide. The fair comparison is the base murder rate in the u s and that's the number that I used. And I am telling you, I mean, I, I know these numbers, I sleep, I wake up with these numbers, cannabis, the for cannabis legal states on a per capita basis, crime murders rose 31% on a per capita basis in those four states over the 2013, 2017 period. Maybe, I'm sorry, I said 31. Maybe it's 29%. So maybe I say I woke up in the, anyway, the the for the u s it's 18% 29% versus 18%. That's the gap. And I am not saying that I know that cannabis legalization caused that gap. What I'm saying is people need to stop claiming that cannabis legalization reduces violent crime. It in, it has

Speaker 2:          29:42          increased in those tasks. You in those states was at universal, the increase, was it almost identical? Yes. At Alaska was the most, uh, then I think murders went up more in cow in Washington. Uh, and what's also interesting, Joe, if you're, if you really want to go into the numbers, is the gap actually widened year by year. So that's sort of what you would expect if this is the result of a psychometric effect. In other words, a psychosis causing effect because cannabis doesn't cause psychosis right away. People break down. But if it's causing heavy use and some of those people are sliding into, you know, paranoia and psychosis, you'd sort of expect the gap to increase over time. And that's what's happened. Okay. So, you know, I'm gonna go back again to the Netherlands. Okay. Because they've had, you know, cannabis legalized forever and they have one fifth of the homicide rate that the United States does.

Speaker 2:          30:33          And they also have a lower cannabis use. That's true. They also, but still, you know, one warrior for kickboxers bus, but, uh, one, one fifth. I mean, it's still, it's, it's pretty drastic overall. And, and again, you know, Alex, you know, you know, I appreciate some of the, are we talking about the correlation between cannabis use? One of the things that we have to accept in America is that when you're in a place like the Netherlands has a long and accepted history of use, people are accustomed to it. So I think things kind of even out. I think one of the things that we're dealing with with the United States is people that have just, they don't, they don't have a long history of experience and it becomes legal and then they use it. And maybe some of them, like we're talking about don't have a tolerance for it, have too much.

Speaker 2:          31:20          And like I was talking about with my friend who's like this really cotton, the one who, uh, had an edible and became suicidal and fucked up for weeks. You guys very confident, very articulate, very intelligent. He's not a, not a Weirdo, not a non transient extreme, extremely successful. You know, I think there are, there are variables that we need to take into consideration and there's certain human beings at exhibit a pattern of behavior that's directly correlated to cannabis use that I don't experience. So if I, I could say from my own personal biases that that's bullshit. That's nothing. It doesn't do anything. I've been smoking for years. Doesn't do shit. Well you probably don't have one of those three genes that we were talking about and you probably also to, um, you know, don't overuse or you have some type of, you know, um, legitimacy as to why you are, you are using it.

Speaker 2:          32:13          And you know, one, I want to keep going with this, but you know, at the end of the show, I think that we should make some type of like recommendations for people just because I hate when you know, you have this big three hour podcasts. Then at the end of it it's just like, hey guys, just be safe. You know, it's like, it's like, fuck it. Let's have some type of like, um, recommendations. Like I love the podcast with, uh, with, with Chris Kresser and Joel. Right? But, um, at the, at the end of it was just sort of like, hey guys, do anything there can die. I think most people realize that one person was going on data and the other person was. Yeah. I mean, I, I find it so fascinating that now when you think back through your, through your life, you've, you've thought of somebody who, who was affected and there were several people.

Speaker 2:          33:08          I'll bet I'll bet as you think about it, you'll think of more people maybe. But those are the big ones. And like I said, my friend who is a martial arts instructor was a pretty significant issue with a lot of our friends. We were trying to figure out what was wrong with him beforehand. He was sending me these videos that didn't make any sense. And uh, I was like, what in the fuck is this? Like, uh, I'll, I'll explain to you more off air so I don't have to uh, out this guy. But what will the, all La, a lot of people that were close to him were really seriously concerned. And now is it something that would have happened anyway? I don't know how he, he's in his twenties. How old is that? Late twenties. 20, you know, that's right around the age. So it is a little, a little bit late Ish.

Speaker 2:          33:51          Like, cause like I said, a lot of the studies, even when you look at the ones on adolescents, like for sure it's, it's below, like they've, they have done studies like below 18 is worse than say below 25 blow 15 is worse than say 18. Like the younger you go, the worse. And He seems to be fine now and it's, uh, you know, I'm not an expert on the subject, but it's because of this, um, if somebody called pruning that we go through, so everyone goes through this and basically if your adolescence, you're going to drop off some, some weak neural connections to kind of pick up some stronger ones. So, you know, it's the best way to kind of explain it. Um, when you use cannabis, you can potentially accelerate that process. And then because you accelerate that process, you don't get those good neuro connections.

Speaker 2:          34:40          And then, you know, people unfortunately, you know, develop things like psychosis and, um, and, and schizophrenia. So, you know, that's kind of where, where they were, where the issue lies. So, you know, one thing that I am very happy that we're talking about and I know Alex will be too, is that, you know, we want to discuss the benefits and in this podcast, make sure that people understand that, you know, I believe that marijuana is Madison. It's an excellent medicine. Um, but the other thing though too is we do want to mitigate the risks because there are real risks out there. So, you know, I do appreciate, you know, um, US talking about adolescence and making sure that they do stay away from cannabis, especially that's like twice. I've read these, you know, these cases, there's a case file sometimes then, you know, the kids started using when he was 11 and you know, it's like that kid never had a chance.

Speaker 2:          35:30          Right. I mean, and obviously the, oftentimes these are kids coming from disadvantaged backgrounds anyway, but you know, they're using by 11 it's 16. They put a, you know, put a gun to somebody's head and pull the trigger. I mean, the, the, the pre adolescent and early teen news, we got to do everything we can to stop. The problem is, yeah, like if you, if you smoke pot in junior high, like say seven, eight, nine, like you're probably going to smoke pot in high school. Like that's the know what I mean? That's what I saw when we went out, when I was growing up. And you know, even when I was home for Christmas for a few days, like yeah, a couple of my friends even talked about, you know, um, some people that we knew, you know, smoked a ton of pot in high school and like now like they're there, they're crazy or they're not really doing too too much, you know?

Speaker 2:          36:13          So you do have to, because with the, I think we're dealing with a lot of ignorance. We're dealing with a lot of ignorance when it comes to biological variability, right? We, we, we don't really understand how a lot of these different things affect people, including like just diet and what, what, what causes depression, like how much, how much of what we constitute or what we just decided as depression. Is Inflammation a poor gut health? There's a lot of variables. A lot of them. Marijuana is absolutely one of those variables. And uh, again, I don't have an issue with it. I liked it. I love the stuff, but it does, it doesn't fuck with me, but I'm also honest and so I see these people where it's pretty obvious to me that something's going on and that marijuana is not a good idea for them. And I just think, you know, like I said in the past, I myself have been guilty of using this, uh, this sort of a blanket description of it as being a positive influence and that it's a good thing for people.

Speaker 2:          37:11          I don't think it's a good thing for everybody. No, it's definitely not a good thing for everybody and it's definitely not a good thing for the people who have those genetics that I discussed earlier. And you know, also too, like, you know, if you, you need to have some type of like self awareness, like the people who you know don't do well with cannabis, you know, you shouldn't have your, to have your friends tell you that he came in like you're not doing too well. You should be able to figure out yourself. But that's hard for people. I mean that's one of the most difficult things for people to do. Is it self upset, self assess to be objective? You know, it's a real, I've obviously, I've heard from a lot of people who used heavily and seen other people who've used heavily in the last month. And I think it's very interesting why people continue to use when they're getting paranoid and, and you know, the, the most cogent argument, and again, I'm, I'm not, you know, I've smoked a handful of times in college and after college, I actually don't think I'd be comfortable using high THC cannabis now knowing what I know. But anyway, so the people, the most Godson, Ryan here, okay, I'm going to get hot box.

Speaker 2:          38:18          I'll give you the shit that, but, but the most, the most cogent arguments, I thought it was so interesting. This guy said, well, you know, my friends, I talked to them and say, I'm paranoid now, but I'm going to smoke through it. I'm going to smoke so much that I'm almost comfortable being paranoid. And I think that's a dangerous thing to do to your mind, cause you're, you're sort of counting on being able to step back from that and stop using. Yeah, that's a, that's a silly, we're looking at it. Um.
