Speaker 1:          00:00          Right? Here's one that people had an issue with w and one thing you could say. Okay. Um, like, uh, when Kathy Griffin held up the, the, the Trump head, remember that? Um, did she do that on her own Twitter account? Uh, yeah. She, yeah, she, well, I mean she posted a photo of it, which she posted. She posted an Instagram, Twitter, I think it was on both. I'm not a hundred percent sure. Right. So that it's, is it allowed? It's allowed because it's newsworthy because it's a celebrity and the celebrity is threatening a public figure who is also the most powerful person in the world. So it's okay. It's that why that is, I think she posted it because it was an art piece that was kind of controversial. Oh, no, no, I know that. And that's what I'm saying. Why they're saying why is it okay, why is she still allowed to be on the platform?

Speaker 1:          00:53          And Alex Jones case kicked off. That's a, it's an interesting question, right? Like what do you need to do to get kicked off? Because that's not the only thing that Kathy has done, um, recently. She was one of the people that was calling for the name for that young boy who was, um, with that native American in front of his face beating the drum. She's, it's crazy, irresponsible. You know? I'm sure she feels bad about it now in retrospect, especially if she's watched the video, but she got carried away and she thought, what we all thought when you saw the picture, there's smirking cunt of a kid that got in the face of this beautiful indigenous man is singing, is his rain dance cry. Whatever the fuck is doing. Yeah. That's not what it was though. We, we found out afterwards it was much more complicated.

Speaker 1:          01:32          What is their song? What were they saying? It sounded cool. They should make a record. Yeah. Do you like that shit? That shit's cool to listen to when you work out. If you could get like some, some legit native American chance, like that puts you into a trance, right? If you don't know what they're saying and you'd just go running and you listen to that. Take a little couple Tokes, go for, go for a jog in the woods, listening to native American chance on your airpods. Ooh, that was an interesting video though, because I mean, I was a one 80 after just hearing the second side of the story, like 12 hours later, people still were calling for that guy's head. Yeah. And people, I saw someone who said, um, what's his name? Ron Perlman? No, who's the guy who was a Hellboy? Yeah, Ron Perlman. Ron Perlman was like, motherfuckers are telling me that, uh, I'm not seeing what I'm seeing.

Speaker 1:          02:22          And she said something about some white prick or white motherfucker. I'm like, oh, okay. People try so hard. Like you, you are seeing what you're seeing. Yeah. You're seeing what you're saying. Well, you're not seeing is a video that shows how it occurred. It's all it is. Yeah. You know? So why is that okay? Right. Why is that okay? Why is it okay for some journalists to say horrible things about white people? Why is that okay? Why is that okay? It seems weird. What if it encourages violence against a innocent white person? Just one. Should you be responsible? What if they say, why did you do that? Well, I read Blah Blah, blahs a tweet and I was like, you know what, I am going to go out and punch a white person. Fuck that. I just found some white old lady not beat her ass.

Speaker 1:          03:10          Like if someone decides that you're not responsible for that. All right. Yeah, probably not. But you kind of kind of feel like you played a part in the way people look at things, especially people that are very easily influenced, you know? It's just also, it's gross. He read something really racist against white people. They like, that's gross. Like you think all all people. I like that. A whole group of people that don't have as much melanin, they're all shit. That's ridiculous. You're ridiculous person. I don't care if you're brown or black or yellow, you're ridiculous. That's silly. It's we have to decide to get to decide like what the fuck we're doing and we keep letting illogical behavior be normal. Like breaking us off into fucking groups like that and thinking that, you know, all men are great, or all women or gray or all gays or grade and every, all straight cisgendered man can go fuck themselves. All right, that's, that's silly talk. I don't care who you are. You're not allowed to do that. But we let people do that. If they're a part of a marginalized class, if someone's a part of a marginalized class, then you get to shit on everybody. In a weird way, you get to like reinforce racism. It's really, it's so fucking counterproductive too, because if you do that, then it just makes people just get defensive on the other side. They don't even want to even think or empathize with how you are.
