Speaker 1:          00:00          Such a fucking benefit for me. It's like when the world gets weird and the world, my world is weird as fuck man. You know, I try to explain it to people. I'm like weird being me, you know? And to be able to just take some time and just go, it's just look at it all through fresh eyes. Like that's the place for me of that tank. Do an hour. I like an hour. But I do too. If I have the time I like two hour session would be yeah, God. And then you have it here is what it's all about. So I can just do it anytime I want. Hell yeah. Like I wake up at three o'clock in the morning. You just drive over here. Sweet.

Speaker 2:          00:32          You w what's your morning routine like? Or do you have a morning routine that you like? Are you sure?

Speaker 1:          00:36          Kind of fasted cardio. That's what I like to do. Or fasted yoga, that's my most recent thing as I'm doing either 14 to 16 hours depending upon what my day looks like. Intermittent fasting. And then, uh, I usually either like yoga or running in the morning today was running and then I'll do something in the afternoon. Either martial arts related or weightlifting related.

Speaker 2:          00:59          Do you, uh, do you drink coffee every morning? Like when you were, when you wake up or,

Speaker 1:          01:02          not always, but I like it. I like these things. She's Nitros who's caveman? Nitros a lot like regular coffee too, but I drink water with Himalayan salt in it too. That's one of the first things. Yeah. I can put a little lemon in there two times. Sometimes I'll throw a little cayenne pepper in that mother fucker. Any apple cider vinegar to that stuff sometimes too. I take a lot of probiotics, a lot of, I eat a lot of Kimchi. I find like Kimchi and game meat is like, I've been on this kick for the past three or four months where I just eat Kimchi and l collect three, four times a week. I mean, on stuff do it. It's hard when you eat some elk before bed and you wake up hard as a rock on the fuck people up. People don't know, man know. Wow, you're heating a super athlete. If you eat elk, your eat, you're literally eating a super athlete, you know, that's bad ass.

Speaker 2:          01:49          It's like a huge, like another reason, not just a doctor Andy, but listening to you, you talk about it because it's in your podcast all the time. Talk about how how beneficial eaten those kind of meats are. And I'm just like, God, I got to do it. And I would just, I feel, I feel so much better doing it. Well if you think about like how health

Speaker 1:          02:05          see it is eat salmon, like a healthy wild salmon that is a, an animal that's out there hustling, you know, a salmon making its way up river. You eat one of those things is just loaded with nutrients and essential fats. And when you eat an elk man, you're eating an animal that's getting away from wolves and bears and fighting to the death with swords grown out of its head. I mean literally it's a forest horse with fucking spears grown out of its head and they're just out there hustling Sirius all day. You know, living out in Montana in the winter, in the middle of the fucking winter, running from wolves and shit. I mean, that's their life. You eat one of those things you eat. It's like, Oh fuck you get charged up. It feels, I've given it to people that never eaten it before and they're like, Holy Shit. And I'm like, yeah, you feel different, right. You feel

Speaker 2:          02:57          even there. Their DNA.

Speaker 1:          03:00          Do you ever do listen to Paul Chek, Paul Chek, he's the Juco condo guy, right, isn't he? No. He's been on Aubrey's and stuff. He's a no, I'm thinking of Paul Vernac. I'm thinking of different guy. Yeah, I've have listened to Paul Chek. I listened to him on Aubrey's pot is amazing. Fuck, he's a wizard. He was explaining how a pasture raised eggs versus just regular eggs that were literally eating the DNA of that chicken and it was he, I don't remember what exactly he said, but it blew my mind. I was like, he's awesome. He would. That'd be, that'd be a good podcast. You and him, that would be sweet. [inaudible] showed me so sweet chickens, they love to eat. Bugs and worms and grass and they love to roam around and if they are allowed to do that, they get a dark, like an orange yolk that you just don't get from those God damn grocery store, egg, chicken souls, grocery store, chickens are prisoners getting little prisoner eggs eaten that putting it into your body, it's better than nothing, but it's nothing like a farm raised free ranging chicken egg.

Speaker 1:          04:00          And you could get those at farmer's markets and stuff like that, like, but you could tell the moment you crack them open. Yeah. I mean it's just orange, like the sun, you know, take care of your chickens. Yeah. Y'All have whatsapp. Are they a pain? It's not the easiest thing really. You know? Yeah. You got to clean the shit and you got to make sure they have enough food. And for me, I've got a squirrel problem. My wife wants to kill the fucking squirrels. Me. I'm like, they're cute little fellas. Right? But they steal all the food. They're fat fucking squirrels. They keep figuring out a way to get into the chicken coop and get all the chicken food. And they're just in there all the time. But now I might have to put them to death because I found out they'd been stealing eggs.

Speaker 1:          04:38          The squirrels have now figured out that they can get eggs. And so a squirrel was trying to roll an egg out of the chicken coop through the hole that he comes in. We caught doing that. I didn't catch it. Catch them. How are you going to get a little fucker? I Dunno. I Dunno. I bet it feels good. I've never, I never hunted and uh, but it feels good shooting and then eating the meat you get good does. I'm nervous though, because I feel like I'd feel so guilty shooting an animal. You will. I remember I shot up there a little longer. Look at it. We've got an egg that's yours. I'll pull that back. Jamie. This, I had no idea that squirrel's did this. I had to find out on my own yard. These little funny faces. Their egg Steelers, Bro. They, how do they know? How do they know? They're so cute. They're so cute. How did they know? They fucking know at Chad, a little motherfucker. You got the chickens. Chickens don't know what to do. It's money. Yeah. Squirrels or they're not smart, but they're determined. I think I might have to run a fucking Arrow through a few of them. Yeah, but I don't want to kill the squirrels. That's the city. You don't want them eating my eggs, but I also don't want to kill them, so I don't know what to do. I know.
