Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:01          Oh God. That's another thing. Not to talk about calling. Oh, my books were banned so many places and uh, and sometimes I think that maybe that's a good thing because they don't, aren't reaching the psychos. My books are abandoned prison systems. Why? Because they are enormously popular. These prison librarians tell me, but the books are considered way too stimulating. So wow. People in prison cannot read my books. Oh, Holy Shit. All prisons, I don't know if it's all, but it's Texas and a number of other really big states. So I dunno, that's kind of a badge of honor. Yeah. But it doesn't equate to the like the uh, the immortality of being banned. Like a how or a tropic of cancer or Salman Rushdie. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Oh God. That fucking struggle. Men, this struggle of wanting to express yourself as, as freely as possible, but being limited even by your own peers. That is, um, that's unexpected to someone as in the outside of literature. Someone who just reads it

Speaker 2:          01:18          because it's not in the comedy world, what is in the comedy world, but not amongst good comedians. Well, another aspect of that is that so often people aren't censoring it because it offends them. They're censoring it because they're afraid it will offend someone. They know they're doing it. They're kind of white knighting on behalf of someone else. David Sedaris, uh, told me this story about, uh, telling a joke, uh, or something very funny about a girl in a wheelchair and how he looked out in the audience and no one was laughing. They were all looking at a girl in a wheelchair. And the moment she started to laugh, the entire audience started to laugh. Oh yeah. And so, so often people in the workshop, they might not personally feel offended by the word, but they're thinking how that word might hurt people. They know. But yeah, that's a fact.

Speaker 2:          02:12          Yeah, that's a, that's a giant issue in comedy. If you, if someone's telling you a joke of someone's on stage talking about someone is fat and there's a fat person in the front row, that joke will bomb. Yeah. It just, yeah, but that's because people are good people overall. You know, they, they recognize that they don't want to cause pain. Another really odd comic David [inaudible] story is that he always told me, uh, when you're on the road, don't read from your current book. Always read from the next book pieces it's way of road testing the stories and finding out which ones work and should go into the next book. And in doing so, he was telling the story about being in this, uh, this forensic, uh, uh, laboratory isn't an as an autopsy was taking place and this autopsy table was adjacent to dis this huge indoor window that separated the autopsy suite from this lunch room and in the lunch room where the rest of the, uh, the forensic staff and they're all eating their lunches.

Speaker 2:          03:12          They all had tuna sandwiches and, and cans of coke and barbecue potato chips. And they were watching through the window as this absolutely perfect. 12 year old boy was being autopsied and just hours before at this kid, like two hours before this kid had been riding his bicycle, he'd fallen over, he'd hit his head on the curb and now two hours later he was dead and dead without almost a scratch on him. Just this perfect naked, dead 12 year old boy on the autopsy table. And as he, the, the technicians eating their lunch, watching it through a window, they watch as the, uh, as the, uh, pathologist in sizes around the top of the kid's face at the top of the forehead, the hairline, and then peels the face down, like peeling an orange peels the entire face off of the skull of this little boy and leaves the face around the neck like a mask, like a rubber mask. And this exposes this liver colored dark red musculature of the child's underlying face. And this one guy watching it with a mouthful of tuna sandwich, he points this out and he says, see that? That there, that's the color of red that I want to paint our rec room. Holy Shit. And when's the Darice told that story in front of 600 people?

Speaker 2:          04:47          It was dead silent. And you could hear people weeping. People were crying and they were hating David Sedaris in that moment and so on. I had to laugh. I laughed really loud like a donkey. And it was amazing how that hatred in that auditorium swung from hating David who they did not want to hate to hating this jackass over here who was actually laughing and so I threw myself on the sword for David and that story never went in any book.

Speaker 2:          05:22          Wow. Did the story not go in any book just because of the reaction by the audience or just an uncomfortable moment? He just decided he would speak to him about it. No, I didn't. I'm not afterwards. It was just such an awkward, painful thing. I would never come to throw it back in his face. Right. To my knowledge, that was the only time the story was told to have those like scattered about are there, there's, are there scenes what you wrote and you just sat and looked at him and went, no, I just got to put that one somewhere else. Oh, there are set that aside jokes that I told where I got hist by 800 people and you know as you can live to those model and then you realize you can live through a lot. If you can be hated by 1100 people at a Barnes and noble on Union Square. Oh yeah. You can be hated by your mother. It's okay.

Speaker 3:          06:11          I know when those people come to see you, how many of those people are fans of literature and how many of those people are specifically fans of your work? Like there's, there would be a difference. Like the people were fans of your work would at least expect some uncomfortable moments.

Speaker 2:          06:25          And for the most part they tend to be, uh, more or less just fans of my work. And still it's still his. Oh yeah. But again, they're hissing on behalf of someone than I hissing for themselves. You know, I made this horrible, cheap shot and they always know a cheap shot. People always know a cheap shot. I, uh, I was commenting about how in breakfast at Tiffany's, Truman Capote had made this observation that Americans don't like true beauty, true classical natural beauty. They want to see a very plain person who has been so groomed. So exercise, so made up so style stylized that she can kind of pass as this, this amazing, strange beauty. That's what Americans want because natural classic beauty is not egalitarian. You're either born with it or you're not. They want to see a plain person who has been transformed. And to make my point at the end of the story, I made a cheap shot. I said, and that's why we have Sarah Jessica Parker and I said this in New York and in New York, Sarah Jessica Parker is worshipped like a god and that whole crowd hissed and booed and did everything but throw excrement at me. Wow. But then later in line, half of them came up and whispered. That was really funny.

Speaker 3:          08:05          Yeah, that's, well that's one of the things about dark comedy clubs. You want them dark? No, you don't want everyone illuminated like the, when the, the crowd is like the one that, this is one of the real issues with doing a comedy special is that uh, especially the old way they used to do them, they still like to light up the audience, which completely changes the dynamic of the room changes what you'll laugh and what you won't laugh at. You know, in a scene like this could Sarah Jessica Parker choke. It's perfect example. If you don't want to be caught dead being the one person that throws her head back. And how's it that,

Speaker 2:          08:38          you know, cheap shots or just to stay away from them. But that's another, I'll ask you, ask you a question. You know, with so many colleges becoming these kinds of strident safe places to demand their own aesthetic, what is it like doing comedy? Well, it hasn't

Speaker 3:          08:56          changed that much. People getting a little got a little bit more sensitive because they're aware that other people are more sensitive without the audiences that come to nightclubs, which is primarily where I perform with, I do a theater. Those people were there to see me. So that's there. They're usually pretty loose, pretty fun, but if you're in a nightclub, they're there to see, especially the comedy store. I'm one of the good things about the comedy store's. There's literally two dozen people in the lineup. They're not necessarily just here to cu did there to see Anthony Chesil neck and Chris Delea and all these other comedians that are also there as well, so you get a a really a much broader comedy audience, but their nightclub audiences, they have a few drinks in them. Maybe this smoked a little pot before they got there. Those people are there to have a good time.

Speaker 3:          09:47          Colleges are a nightmare now. Hmm. It's a nightmare because it's recreational outrage. It's it's kids who have been under the control of their parents for most of their life and haven't had their own sovereignty and identity and now they're free and they are very quick to be outraged. They want a porn out there. Moral superiority. There wasn't virtue signal and every opportunity they want to shut down anything to think is air quotes problematic. They don't want things to go on a bad when they think for some reason that comedy should be uplifting and it should only punch up. Like I had this conversation once with a professor who wrote a book on a comedy and he said all great comedy punches up. And I said, that's bullshit. I said, one of the greatest bits of all time as Sam Kennison spit about starving children in Africa about watching those commercials were starving kids in Africa and you know, couldn't you please help? And he goes in kinnisons like he just want to grab the guy, hey,

Speaker 4:          10:47          why don't you help them? You're right fucking there or send someone like me. He goes, sends, send something like me. It's going to take these people go, hey, we just drove here 5,000 miles with your food and it occurred to us do you wouldn't be world hunger, have you? People would live with a fucking vote as he goes. Can I hear you say that? That Sam, we got sand in America too. We just don't live in it, asshole. And he's, he goes and one of the greatest bits of all time is literally about starving babies in Africa. It's one of the greatest

Speaker 3:          11:18          bits of all time and he didn't have anything to say. You didn't know where to go with it. I'm like, don't, don't say comedy is only about punching up. That's crazy talk. That's what you're doing is you're, you're, there's, there's this moral thing that they're trying to achieve that it literally is completely independent of humor. It's not what's funny. It's like there, they want to, they want it to be a multipurpose tool. They want it to be funny as well as morally uplifting and great for people who discriminated against and amazing for folks who are marginalized and uplifting for those who are disenfranchised. Well that's not what comedy is. Comedy is funny. Those things are wonderful in and if you want to do a spoken word show or poetry or writing or you know, a one person play those, those are great, but that's not funny.

Speaker 3:          12:16          Comedy is funny, so it's either funny or it's not funny and some things are funny that are fucked up. You know? Kennison had a bit about homosexual necrophilia acts or paying money to spend a few hours undisturbed with the freshest male corpses. And He, so he would lie down on his stomach and he goes, you imagine these people, they're on the slabs are like well, went through life and had a good time and everything and now I guess I'm going to go and be with Jesus and Hey, what the hell is this? And he's rocking back and forth.

Speaker 4:          12:47          It feels like some guy's got his dick in my ass. He made live keeps fuck you in the ass even after you're dead. It never ends. It never ends.

Speaker 3:          12:55          Oh he would close on it cause it was the, he couldn't follow it. Who was such a powerful bit. It was about a dead guy getting fucked in the ass. There is no further down that you could punch other than starving babies in Africa.

Speaker 2:          13:10          You know, and I'm not sure about it, this is punching down, but do you remember the s the routine that kind of put Whoopi Goldberg on the map a million years ago about being a black surfer chick? No. Oh, you know, she did it on television. I must've seen it on cable when I was like 19 years old, but she talks in valley speak. Nobody's seen this will be person before. She's brand new. Nobody's ever seen her on television. She's got this funny name and she's doing this valve speak about being the only black surfer chick on the beach. And she loves surfing and she loves this one white surfer guy. And she finally hooks up with them and then she realized that she's pregnant and it's all very funny. The whole front end, you're just roaring with laughter and then she's pregnant and she doesn't know what to do. So she gets a rusty wire coat hanger and she goes into a public bathroom on the beach and she gives herself a coat hanger abortion and it spills out there on the concrete floor and everything's okay. And now I'm back on the beach and I'm just doing fine. And why don't you come on down and see me here on the beach? It's great down here. It's great. Holy Shit. It's a fantastic piece. And she did it on television and she did it on TV and it started so light, like an IRA, 11 novel, and then I went to such a dark, horrible place, and then it came up with just this kind of token. Everything is okay ending every, I'm going to be all right. Don't worry. This is just something that happened.

Speaker 4:          14:49          Yeah, dude, dude

Speaker 2:          14:52          just leaves you shaken. And that's the kind of comedy I love. It goes to the that dark or that sentimental place and it breaks your heart and then it kind of comes out of it a little bit. But I were 11 did that so well. Nora Ephron in her books, she was so good at doing that. Heartburn, heartburn is fantastically funny, but by the end you're just weeping. The book is so sad.
