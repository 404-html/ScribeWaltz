Speaker 1:          00:00          When you're sleeping at night, we camped. We would do snow shoe like just deep into the back. So we had, we would go into, you had to do your cold weather training. So getting your dry suits on and swimming through the surf at nighttime. Wonderful. Which is an ice cream headache over and over and over again. And as the ocean breaks over your head, it's pretty bad. And the cold weather, uh, immersion test is there where you have to get into the water but just a pair of shorts on for five minutes and just then reward yourself. So they get you to a point of hypothermia, right to the edge. It's um, I think, uh, as many things are in my old job, there is a aspect of learning and there is an aspect of tough it out and you combine the two. So it, it sucked.

Speaker 1:          00:40          And there was, there was a reason that they wanted it to suck, but they're also trying to teach a lesson. Right? But God forbid they just teach the lesson. So they make you suffer to ingrain it probably. Yeah. So one day you wake up and on the board, like a little white board that has the list of gear you need. It just says shorts running shoes. I'm like, okay, this is February and Kodiak, what are you talking about? They like I said, I said, shorts, running shoes, get out in the forward, ICAN align van. So we all get out there and they drive to the beach where seawater is freezing at the edge and they say, okay, go out. You have to completely submerge yourself neck deep water, five minutes. And the timer starts, timer starts when the last person submerges their head. Oh God.

Speaker 1:          01:23          So you might be first, you might be able to be all fired up and it, you're just going to get seven and a half minutes is what you're getting. So you go and you sit there and it's the coal, it hurts for a minute and then you're numb. The worst thing about it actually is rewarming. It feels like you're just getting pin pricked over and over and over again. Yes. That's actually a Barklow. Oh, that is Barklow look at him standing up there on that rock will Barklow has a great rewarming drill that we actually played on the podcast before for Sitka where he uh, takes their gear and jumps into a lake. So that is the rather yeah. And then re warms himself with basically all sit cause gear and figures out how to get your body back to what I thought it was interesting that I'd never really considered those.

Speaker 1:          02:05          That eating food actually ramps up your body heat because you have to burn off the calories, your body starts processing. The food actually is good for elevating potty temperature, eating food, especially if you can get hot food of course. But just eating. So the drill, the drill he was doing actually had much more, uh, I would say educational benefit because they would make them, they would take them there with all of their gear, their gearless would say whatever they were wearing, plus bring your tent, your sleeping bag and all your stuff because we're going to put you into the water and then you need to survive your way out of it. So they would, they would have to erect a tent. They would have to get their sleeping bag out all after being in the water for five minutes, which is exactly what a survival situation is going to look like for us.

Speaker 1:          02:44          We went in there, got back into the van, and I sat in a hot tub and drank beer for the rest of the day. So I got the understanding of what it feels like to be hypothermic and that just see they have to push their head underwater. Woo. That guy right there is either screwing everybody or was the first person to complete it. Um, now Wim Hoff does so much of this cold water submersion stuff and he, he actually enjoys it and loves it. You know? Do you think that there's a way that you could use like his methods and get through that with less pain potentially, even though you know, all of the skills that I used in Kodiak, I, I did not ever use a single one of them. Operationally, I use his breathing method in the Cryo tank. That makes sense. Therapy, that makes sense.

Speaker 1:          03:27          But that art does Arctic conditions, I don't know, at least in the modern theaters of war were engaged in, I don't know where the applicability would be. So it might be a little bit of a benefit versus time expended to teach the guys that stuff. You know, because unless it's a, we're talking like Korea probably farther in the northern latitudes. I mean it's, uh, like the training was amazing. Like I said, I didn't use a single bit of it. Right. But if something, well, it's also building mental toughness and determination. And that's why I said there's an aspect of learning and there's an aspect of just, this is going to suck. Hey you guys, guess what? You're going to do a 20 kilometer hike into the back country and snow shoes. There is no end state to this. There's no target. You're going to do anything on.

Speaker 1:          04:12          You're just going to go out there and you're going to do it and you're going to survive out there and it's going to suck for three days and then you're gonna come back. You just embrace this suck. Or you learn how to pack your backpack better, you know, or you learn how to move better over that terrain are you learn how to navigate in that environment. So there's always an essence of it, but it just happens to be that there's usually a pain component with it as well. Yeah. A lot of military training is like that. There's an essence of a pain compliance and then the actual learning technique as well. Yeah, it's the learning technique. I mean, it is really, you're, you're learning a technique to manage your mind under sucky conditions. I mean, that is a technique as well, right? So I was actually having a conversation with somebody about this recently.

Speaker 1:          04:52          Uh, I'm of the opinion that really the only thing that I learned how to do when I was a seal was to enhance my ability to learn other things. It's, you're selecting for people and, and to get to that point, you've got to maintain control of your emotions, whether you're in pain or you're hot or you're cold. So there's that, that essence of self control, but then they require so many different skill sets in so many different things that the selection process is looking for and then at the end of it, teaching people how to become better learners and then you just refine that over and over and over again over a career. It's the ability to learn is probably the biggest takeaway that I have from my time in service. I think that's the best thing you could ever really learn is learning how to learn.

Speaker 1:          05:38          Like learning how to learn correctly. Learning how to actual, pay attention to what someone's teaching you and absorb it and follow the steps rather than fuck it up with your own ego and your own insecurities or whatever it is. It's going to trip you up. If you can get good at something, you know you can, you can apply that to almost anything if you really, yeah, and, and then they would pair it with, we'll surround you by, okay, we want to make you better at shooting. So we are going to go find world champion, pistol carving shooters. Go apply your ability to learn with them and we to do it for weeks. Okay? Now you're going to specialize. You're going to be appointment, so you need to be able to navigate and climb. So we're going to send you out to Joshua tree for two weeks with worldclass climbers. Go apply your ability to learn with them, and then jumping and then diving, and then tactics, and then fill in the blank over a career.
