Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. Yup. But that's the problem that we'd forbidden stuff. It never works well. It's also a Italian food and wine seem to go hand in hand and, and it's, I think, I mean did they used to be what they drank because they were concerned with getting sick. Right. And one of the best ways to not get sick was to drink wine because, well, yeah, the alcohol content would keep the water from, I mean like if you just drink water all the time, especially if it's sitting still, you could get some bad fucking water. Right. You can get bad water from a lake. I mean, how many, they didn't know Jack Shit about parasites back then. How many people got some terrible diseases from drinking puddle water and Shit, you know? Sure. A lot. Oh yeah. He just find some water like, oh, we're thirsty. Time to drink.

Speaker 1:          00:49          And, or even at creek you drink in a creek and you think like, oh, this is a beautiful stream. This is a clear water. Yeah. But a beaver took a shit just a hundred yards a match that you don't know about it. You get what's called beaver fever. That's what you're for real. That's what they called Giardia. They call it beaver fever. Yeah. That can be good. Now it's terrible. So they used to drink wine to prevent what they would call traveler's disease because people would take these, those, what are those things called? The leather things that they would carry wine and I want to say flask, but it's not a flask. What are those? Those those leather satchels I [inaudible] I thought they use philosopher. Dot. But I'm not sure. It might be, there's a term, it's like a leather bag and it had like a on the end, like a cork and he just drank from that.

Speaker 1:          01:38          And that's how they would hydrate. Yup. People must have been just hammered all day. When you read the statistics of how much people used to drink, it's amazing that anything got done because it's just people where that ain't good morning through night and her, they must have been horrific to each other. Then just just to imagine like a whole civilization that is a drunken bar at 1:00 AM angry drag. Yeah. It's funny cause I never, and I mean I've seen it enough that I get it. People get edgy and weird where when they drink too much, but I never got it because to me it's like if I'm drunk he like, that's when I'm happy. I want to hug people. Why would I want to be in a bad mood? This is also this. Well you're a nice guy. That's what it is that comes out the, yeah, if you're a fucking asshole you, she'll drunk.

Speaker 1:          02:26          I see you. Especially if you just barely keeping that ass hole under the surface. She's barely just want to try and stab her but in club them and steal their women and then you get a couple of drinks in you and this, this is alcohol. Alcohol is a great social lubricant thing. It's great for releasing inhibitions and letting people communicate with each other more freely and have fun. But it's also, it removes doubt and that's not good. Right? I think Todd is critical. Like doubt is one of the pieces of the great puzzle, right? The, the great puzzle has many ingredients and one of those ingredients is doubt and doubt is important. You should look at anything you're about to contemplate and go think about this. When we think what could go wrong when you get a couple of drinks, fuck it, let's do it, let's go.

Speaker 1:          03:17          And then next thing you know, you know you're on an Internet meme. Hold my PR. Yeah, exactly. We talked about that yesterday, like some of the most more ridiculous ones, but there's so many of those out there and almost all of them I have to do with alcohol. [inaudible] right. And I think what you are saying about dove, there's a great Alan Watts, the guy who polarizes an and that weighs in Mendota, that stuff. He had these good eighth line, he called it the wisdom of insecurity. You know, these ideas that had real careful, there's always don't diary not being dogmatic and which doesn't mean the problem is then people take that concept to Fairen that donating to having no bowls and not being able to pick a stand. That's not a solution either. That's the other side of the problem. But there's a sweet spot in between where you can take stances, but they are careful stances.

Speaker 1:          04:04          They are sent stances that are very willing to be changed at the drop of a dime if you show the good evidence to to change them. You know? He's, that to me is what intellectual honesty looks like, you know? Yeah, I agree. I think it's good to be aware of all the possibilities. I used to tell people that when I was a teaching taekwondo, like people that wouldn't compete if they were really, really nervous. I'd be like, the really smart people are really nervous because you're aware of all the possibilities of everything that could go wrong. The people that aren't worried about it at all, they're usually dumb. There's that. But also to me, there are some people, like I look at, some of the people were able to keep it together in this, like kind of like Chuck Lee died, right? Take a nap right before a fight kind of thing.

Speaker 1:          04:49          I can't tell by looking at those guys and just be like, you know something. I don't know what, you know, there's something there that you're doing confidence for sure. I mean, chuck had been knocking people unconscious for many, many years and he knew exactly what to do and I think knew he was good at it. There's that for sure. And I think there's the other side is knowing that, okay, if I have decided to do it, fear is not going to help me now. You know, if that would me to make decisions solely or, but right now he's now going to help me. So let's figure out, man, he was hilarious. There's um, my girlfriend fights MMA professionally. You notice that? Yeah, she's wise. I've been paying attention to uh, your escapades online. She's, she's crazy. She's crazy. She said she literally at the Chuck Liddell mode where she, she took a nap right before a fight and you know, like 45 minutes before you have to wake her up and going like, hey Randy.

Speaker 1:          05:36          And she's all like, okay, ready to roll. And I'm like, I would not sleep for a week prior out. You managed to keep it together like kids do. I used to do that. I used to sleep before fights. It's good. That's awesome. Yeah, but it's you, you're, you just can get yourself into a more calm state. It's so much better than I'm frantically running around and freaking fretting plus is a, it's a, it freaks out your opponents. I would sleep like right in the bleachers. I just go to sleep right there and everybody else would be nervous and shit. And you're sleeping. Exactly. Do you look at them and that, I'm supposed to find that guy. The guy was sleeping right before the fight. Hell No. Like the first match studied. I was nuts because you know, you're in the locker room and there's the guy sitting next to you goes out for his match. Come right back. [inaudible] covered bladder. They're telling you, okay, you get ready, you're going next. And I'm dying. Right. I just see kid Outta hell. And she's all like La la, la.

Speaker 2:          06:41          Okay.
