Speaker 1:          00:00          May I took came and the kids, we traveled around Australia or in, uh, it must've been the end of 2007 early last year and we camped out on the tunnel me desert, which is like one of the last places to really be discovered and explored in Australia. Like there's, there's no artificial lights out there at all, like whatsoever. And we camped out on the desert. 90 thing that was around us was like dingoes and camels. Like you'd hear them moving for the night. Camels. Yeah. Yeah. But we sat there at camp. I just had the, my, my truck, my ute, you know, with the camper on the back, like real lightweight set up and we sat there, no lights on in the camper or anything. So you're sitting in the pitch black moonless night and the media's dude like, I reckon we counted 40, 50 media's over like half hour or an hour, just the naked.

Speaker 1:          00:50          I seen him, perfect dude sitting there with the family and I'm like, this is, this is the best. Like this is, it was so amazing just to sit there, especially with the kids. And Kim as well. Nerving when you find out how many times they enter the atmosphere? Oh yeah, there's a, I think good Jaimee could probably look this up, but I think a hundred tons of media hits the Earth every single day. 100 tons, dude. But most of it enters in dust form because it breaks up. But uh, so last year, um, I was up at my cabin just chilling out by myself. Woke up in the morning, they to do a pierce, walked out and I'm looking up and this media come through and it was so bright that it actually lit up the ground dude, like the most incredible media that I've seen. I had a time lapse photo going in the opposite direction.

Speaker 1:          01:40          I quickly turned that around and you see that the media's dust for like, it lasts for 25 minutes, half an hour in the, in the camera, and it's just drift and change and shape in the atmosphere. It was insane. So it's just like every now and then there's like a real good one. So then I started looking it up and I seen one that Rick, a whole village like in Germany or something like that. This asteroid comes through rec and shit that it didn't even touch, but that comes so close to it. It blows the walls and the windows out and everything, and I'm like, this is fucking scary. We live on a little speck that's turning in one of many galaxy. You know, my friend Randall Carlson put it best. He said, we live in the middle of a shooting gallery, isn't it? In signs, just the time.

Speaker 1:          02:23          The perspective of, you know, hundreds of millions of years. It doesn't seem, it doesn't register to us because we're only around for a hundred years. Yeah. So when we look up and we see the moon, I mean the moon looks like a fucking stop sign in the most Janky is redneck town. When people shoot at signs, yes, the wound looks like it's just fucking shot. It's just getting nailed all the time, especially with no atmosphere. All those things make it all the way through. Nothing gets slowed down by the air or burns up in the atmosphere. Isn't that crazy? Everything just slams into it. Boom, boom. Magic being up there. It must be all day long. I must be slamming things. Oh, it was only a, I think it was like 10,000 years ago. There was like a big bang, like, like a big media hit hit the earth. And, uh, I started looking into that and then I started really looking into aborigines in Australia, indigenous, how long they'd been around for and stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          03:20          And there's now evidence to say that they'd been around for 70,000 years. They live through like three of those big media is hitting the earth. You know, like, it's crazy to think about like why, I wish we had video cameras back then, you know, and I could have recorded that. We could look at it now. Like imagine that. Well, Randall Carlson, the guy that I talked about earlier, he is a proponent of this theory that this is what ended the ice age. Yeah. And he's got some pretty compelling evidence to back it up in terms of, um, like massive, massive fields field with a dead woolly mammoths and died almost instantly. Some of them with their legs broken from the force of the impact on real. Yeah. He's, you know, it's really interesting because he's a guy who, uh, I don't think he has a degree in this stuff, but he's so well read in it that he has these debates and conversations with people that do have these degrees in it and he can tell them things about it.

Speaker 1:          04:16          And it's hard in those fields to be taken seriously if you don't have a phd in whatever discipline it is. But man, his, uh, his work on these things is so compelling and the podcast that I did with them are just mind blowing. But in, in terms of like the evidence that points to some event that ended the ice age very rapidly and caused the disintegration of the poet, of the, um, the ice that was over North America, you know, North America, it's something like a mile high plus she device over the most of it. Just 10,000 years ago. Yeah. Yeah. 12,000 years old, I think I was driving through Wyoming and they've got all these signs up in Wyoming that are really interesting. And it was desert rock formation. It'll tell you how all of that rock formation is, how it formed. You know, cause like, you know, rock usually in beds, in layers like this, it's formed in layers like this.

Speaker 1:          05:06          And then you'll see a rock like that, you know, all the lines of like this, there's some of them there that are like hundreds of million years old, you know, and there's a sign there Sean. And it's just, it's incredible to think how much the irfs changed. And you just said it were around for a hundred years at a time Max. You know? And it's just like we're dropping the freaking ocean. Like even the whole human ratios that is a drop in the ocean compared to like how old the earth is. And it's just crazy to think of like, it's hard to comprehend that there was that much high. So over here, cause there's none now, you know, but it's been that long, you know, and that's, yeah, it's mind boggling to think of. Well they say they find shells in Montana. I found some on top of friggin some big Macer out in the desert.

Speaker 1:          05:51          Dude, there's no water for miles and there's shells. There's, there was like staff fish fossilized the rocks and it's all like coral bed, you know. And that was like, that was like the bottom of the ocean. That was a reef bed as the Great Western inland sea. Yeah. They had sharks out there. I'd say. I think they had megla dawns and Montana Shit. They find dinosaurs there all the time. Want to Dudley's friends? Well, Dudley knows a guy who has a ranch out there in Montana and he found a bone in his, uh, in his ranch. Just maybe something protruding from the ground. Um, and he wanted someone to get a look at it. So he got ahold of some, uh, I guess, what would you have paleontologist? They went and they said, you got to fucking t rex here, Bro. I'll Lee t rex on your property.

Speaker 1:          06:38          Unbelievable. They, I think they gave him $1 million for it. Really? Yeah. Cause this is like a fully intact or close to intact t-rex. Far Out. Yeah. They apparently monetary please Colorado would you got then megalodon was found supposedly in Texas. Jesus Christ. What the fuck? That's a fucking great. What? Shock boy. That's a stupid movie. The Meg. The Meg. Yeah. I'll watch that shit. I watched it the other day. I was like, what am I sit in through here? So stupid. There wasn't just one. There was a bunch of them did get or can you find out how much a media, yeah, I have. I was struggling to find that. And then I think I found what you found. So it says, here's from NASA's website, there's a hundred tons of dust and sand size particle every day. Hit Earth every day. But that's every day, doesn't it? It seems like it would put the balance of the earth off, you know, like, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          07:36          Like, are we sending shit back out and displays that? We sent in a hundred tons of [inaudible] out in the spice every day to off load this. Look at this 2000 years or so, a Meteora meteoroid the size of a football field hits earth and causes significant damage to the area. That's fine. Once every faculty in the next 10 minutes and object large enough to threaten or a civilization comes along, not just that bigger than that, uh, impact craters on earth, the moon, another planetary planetary bodies or evidence of these occurrences. Yeah. They don't even know. You know, that's the most spooky thing. Like Neil degrasse Tyson said that we are decades away from being able to do anything about one of those things coming our way. And I said, so all these periods of think that like they could stop it when it's happening. He's like, not happening. He goes, there's nothing you could do.

Speaker 1:          08:24          What about Armageddon, Bro? The mercy Bruce Willis. Yeah. We've got a solar swells up there. He'll figure it out. Sort it out. Yeah. Yeah. There's a, people have like a real distorted idea of the technological capabilities in terms of like, first of all, NASA, so under budgeted, they barely have enough money to put satellites in orbit. They don't have enough money to stop coming in. I mean, the amount of money you would need is so fucking massive. They would take a cooperative joint effort of every major country in the world. And it's such a of nature and you know, a force of nature usually can't be fucked with scary. Well, they're all, they can do all they think they could do in the, and not even now, but in the future is move it off target slightly. Yeah. Yeah. Somehow or another give it a bump, send it into Mars or something at a certain distance and it completely misses. Yeah. Cracks and Nunes dare darkness a lot for forever.

Speaker 1:          09:20          Yeah. It's scary spaces scary and you don't really see space unless you're out there with no light pollution. I don't think people that don't camp or that you don't go, you know, you look up at night like last night, uh, well not last night but a couple of nights ago when it wasn't raining. It was a clear night and I saw quite a few stars because it was no moon and I was like wow, it's so pretty, but it ain't shit. But you know what I'm saying. The volume over. Yeah. It was photos that you have. Yeah. Add at my farm. You can just sit there with a knife at all and you can look right into those. There's so many stars and it looks like a dark spot of the Milky Way cause you can see so much of it. You know, you see a color in it and everything gets an amazing spot.

Speaker 1:          09:59          Yeah. The color's weird. Right. What is the color? What is that on the, I was, I looked at some photos of it. Oh, not my own photo. Someone else's photos. And that will show on the, the like the roller images and the color that was coming out of these raw images. They look like absolute pillars, like painted pillars dude. Yeah. You know, and it's, I dunno, I dunno if it's a depth finish it. If it's something like that. Jamie put go to Adam's a that the first man. Yup. Instagram again like these, this is like the ones of um oh look at that one from BC. Go Down one strip that, that one there. That's with the northern lights in it. Wow. But yeah, that's sudden no light pollution out there. Obviously you saw the northern lights and Casey, I don't know. You could see him in BC.

Speaker 1:          10:48          Yup. That's how you had to be in like Icelander so I'm sure that was cool. I've seen him when I was in northwest territories, I lining up the ground like and Ryan, front of your eyes. I would just like dance and constantly right in front of your eyes. That was awesome. In the Northwest Territories of Australia? No, in Canada. Oh, okay. Yeah. Northern territories of Australia. Right. That's what they call it. The last is, yeah. Okay. So where's it at the best though? Is it the best place to see it in like Iceland or some shit or Norway? I Dunno. I Dunno. I've seen it. So I've seen it in northwest territories is I've seen it in BC. I don't think we didn't say it in Alberta when we're there. No, no, but I think we had shitty wherever wall will. Yeah, it's gotta be a crazy thing to see though, Hon. It's like green smoke in the sky. Yeah. If you go down a couple more Jamie please.

Speaker 2:          11:39          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:41          Silent. There's the, there's the farm go up one. Yeah, hit that one in the middle there. Wow. Look at the car. That one. God, that's amazing. And is that what kind of, you have to do something with the aperture. Wolf of Stata is, it's open for longer, so it's Gavin in more light. You know, like the human eye. You have to actually lie there and the dock for a fe wall and just like stare into that sort of to get a good look at it. How long has it opened to get that image? That's like a 13 or 15 seconds. Oh Wow. Yup. You can leave it in for 30 seconds or you can put it on like a actual jammed open for a long time, but it's way too much light for what the farm has and you can start getting a lot of distortion as well.

Speaker 1:          12:25          That's such a cool picture with the cabin as well. The light coming out of the cabin. Isn't that crazy that there could be infinity irfs out there? Yeah, that's what's crazy is that each one of those is a son. Yeah. And most of them are bigger. I mean, apparently our son is a little bitch ass bitch ass son. Thank God for that. I was, there will be fraud. Oh, we just have to be further away, but the big ones don't last that long. Apparently Our signs a good one. It's a, it's like a, it's like a Toyota Tercel spot that gave shade Ohio locks. You may fucking last cruiser.
