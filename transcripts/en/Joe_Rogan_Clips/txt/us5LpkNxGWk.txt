Speaker 1:          00:00          I Dunno if kids have changed or whatever. Now they haven't changed. They just think that this is the thing to do. Now, look, when I was in, when I was doing college is way back in the day, I was in my twenties, I did a college in Connecticut. And right after I did the call, I was talking to the kids. I would do, I would do my set and then, uh, I would like open up for Q and a yeah. Fuck's going on my throat. But it was, um, I was probably 23, four, 25, maybe, maybe 25 at the oldest. So I'll just, a couple of years older than them. And so it was fun for me to talk to them about what life is like when you actually have to pay your own bills and you're out, you're out free. And some guy goes, uh, you know, you got like, I was doing the question thing and some guy goes, uh, I go, you know, I, I lift his hand to be able to tell a joke.

Speaker 1:          00:56          I go tell a joke and I go to Jews, walk into a bar, they buy it. It's an old fucking street. Yeah. Street joke after the show, you know the show goes great. I say thank you. I really appreciate you guys coming out. It was really a lot of fun. Thank you. Good night. So afterwards I was hanging around and say hi to people and there was no picture taken back then cause he had to have an actual camera. Then we had a fucking camera. It was a long time, long time ago. This is a, I'm 51 so this is a 90 91 92 somewhere around that. Um, so this one guy comes up to me, he goes, the joke you said about Jewish people's very offensive and I thought he was joking. I go, are you serious? I think it was, yes, very offensive.

Speaker 1:          01:38          And he's like nervous and shit and like it has a hard time looking me in the eye and I go, dude, I could think about what the joke says. It's about Jewish people being really good at business. You walk into a bar, they decided to buy it. It's such a, it's nothing offensive about it at all. You know? It's crazy. It's like it's like people now and maybe forever. I've always heard shit and they immediately think this means if I'm thinking something bad about this, that means that someone is saying something bad about it. They decided this is a taboo subject. Even if you're not even say anything negative about it. Like say if you do a joke about interracial relationships or interracial race, you just say it. If you just do a joke about that, there are people that are going to put red flags up instantly and look to misinterpret anything that you say on purpose because they don't want, they don't want that thought in their head.

Speaker 1:          02:30          They don't want the thought of, you know, like this guy's looking for antisemitism in that joke to Jews walk into a bar, they buy it. There's nothing there. You could look all day long. It's a joke about Jewish folks buying stuff, right? It does. It does. Nothing negative or a positive stereotype. It's like a big Dick Black Guy, Joe. It's not negative. There's nothing negative about it. Nobody gets upset that you think they have a big deck. Plus they have a little deck. It's a lot of lead time. It's, it's young people that also flexing, right? They're free from the control of their parents and I find them you dealing with that more in like rich or upper middle class families because I think they're more hands on with their kids and more controlling and those kids get free. They want to exert their own freedom and when they get free of their parents, they want to establish that they're different and that they have their own mind, their own, and then we're part of the new generation. The new generation is not going to tolerate racism, CIS Hetero activity and they just decide that they're going to fucking put their foot down. But it's a pattern that repeats itself over and over and over again. It's just today they have social media and this is the difference. The difference is they feel like they're empowered because they get online and other morons that are the same age as them. Confirm with.

Speaker 2:          03:47          You can just confirm any belief that you want. Like that's another lesson I've gotten from this is just like confirmation bias is like the wildest shit ever. You can, you can be like, there's one lady who wrote some Shit, I'm anti gay, anti black and other people. Yes. I'm like, yes, this is clearly, this is clearly what he was saying. I'm like, what that you took that from my set. Me, I'm anti gay and I don't think there's a solution here. Yeah, I've looked at this heart for a long time now. We need safe spaces for comedians. Just no solution because you're dealing with immature people in terms of like the literally the development of their frontal lobe. They're not fully formed yet. How much do you think of it is like I put it in my, the op Ed that I wrote, but it's like, I was thinking about like how much of it now as a function of the fact that like we immediately get whatever we want in our hands. You know what I mean? Like those instant gratification. So it was like instant kind of thought process where there's no real thinking that occurs. It's more just like, this comes into my brain. I hear gay black, it has to be, this is wrong. It's coming out.

Speaker 1:          04:52          Yeah, for sure. I mean, if you say gay black on stage today in a really liberal, very progressive environment, you get this thing you, but you have to say something like pro super pro gay and super pro black and it, it doesn't even have to be a joke. Right? Like get, you're better off just going for that applause. Break, move

Speaker 2:          05:12          comedian. I mean, people want, people want their comedians to be their leaders. That's what, that's what it feels like when it is one a laugh. No, people, when I say people, I mean like this next group of, uh, of comedy, like of the people that were at the shop, because the comedians that are going to be their leaders aren't even gonna be funny. They're gonna fucking die to starve to death. You get, once you get out in the real world, fuck man, if you're not funny, you're fucked. Yeah. Nothing but like, it's like, like if I went up there and I said Asians other shit and fuck Whitey, I would've been, I have been the out on the fucking chairs. They were, they're going to carry me out like this is all mother fucking, you know what I mean? But like that's the thing I think like people like I'm not a hero man.

Speaker 2:          06:01          I'm not, I'm just trying to be heard, you know? Well, your comic. Yeah. Not trying to be funny. Yes. That's all it is. This is, uh, I really believe that this is just a symptom of growing up and you're just giving these people the power to express themselves where there's, there's no mature, wiser person that's around them. It's his, hold on, let's look at the context of what he's doing. Right. Let's examine what he's doing and then you're going to apologize to him because this is clearly a fucking joke. You hired a guy to tell jokes. He tells jokes and you say, not that chuck, this specific thing. It's strange because there were like, everyone's like, he did not respect what the event was. I'm like, Hey. I'm like, what? I mean, I'm not this, I'm not your mascot here, right? I'm not, this is not a pep rally dog. I'm here to tell jokes, but you weren't hired to do a speech about this event. I'm here. Did he rack my fucking act?
