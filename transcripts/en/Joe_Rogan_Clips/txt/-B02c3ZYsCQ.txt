Speaker 1:          00:00          This, you're a very popular, what I would call conservative thinker. Yeah. But you're very young. Like how did this all happen? How did you become this Fox News personality? Conservative thinker?

Speaker 2:          00:12          Yeah. I mean I just like launched a youtube channel and ah, fucking youtube. Yeah. Youtube where, where magic happens. You choose a strange place. It's a strange, strange place. Yeah. Well it's the internet and the Internet stream things happen on the Internet. But yeah, I just kind of, I was really passionate. Um, I understood I had studied for like, it sounds strange, but like I spent a year underground like studying politics once I had my red pill moment, if that's what you want to call. Explain that. Because you used to be a liberal, right? And then you became a conservative. That's correct. So what was it? So the story like really starts with like high school I guess. Like you know how things can happen to you in life and they don't make sense when they happen. You're like, why God me? And then when you get a little older and you're like, this makes perfect sense.

Speaker 2:          00:57          Right? So I was the quote unquote victim of a hate crime when I was in high school. When you say quote unquote victims, no, I hate the word victim and it's, I'm like Anne again early. I can see why early on I've sort of developed this mentality that like being a vague, there's no value in being a victim and people rush to call people a victim. They rush to call somebody to get aggressor. So how do you describe it that you experienced at his experience? Something that was labeled a hate crime? I W I wouldn't even call it a hate crime. I think we live in a label obsessed culture. And before we seek to understand what happened, we seek to like put it in a box. Yeah. Like so what? Someone has to be a demon and someone has to be an right. Right, right.

Speaker 2:          01:32          So what happened was I received some voice mail messages from about four kids and the like, you know, the language was, it was pretty strong. It was like, we're going to tar and feather your family. Um, we're going to put a ball in the back of your head that we did the Martin Luther King, like you know Edward Edward, Edward. Um, you received these on your phone? On my cell phone? Yeah. How'd they get your phone number? Well, there was a prank phone call, so I didn't know I was like four male voices and I was like in high school at the time and I was like, okay. I cannot think of for human beings that want me dead, that would say like, we're going up, put a ball in the back of your head like we did to Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks. Like naming your own school. Where were you? What part of the country? Stanford High School in Connecticut. Okay. That's a shit hole. Yeah, it's a total shit hole. Hey Connecticut. Yeah. No I didn't because I think it's on a shit hole.

Speaker 1:          02:15          It's a running joke. I'm sorry. Oh Shit. I gotta grab my Buddy Tommy Junior. He lives in Connecticut and I'm always telling him, dude, you gotta move out of Connecticut. And it became this terrible running joke where I talk about the Connecticut's to worst. Have you actually been a bunch of times? Yeah, I used to work there all the time. What's it? Well, I used to work in all over Connecticut. When I was doing standup, I would drive from Boston into Connecticut. I did like a lot of gigs in Hartford. I did gigs. Hartford is a shit hole. It's a shithole bridge is a shithole. Shout out to Mario and starling junior though. Yeah. Um, he was a boxer that came out of a Hartford. Yeah. Big Time boxer. Marlin, Marlin, starling. Um, but when you were in high school, right, somebody

Speaker 2:          03:00          started doing this prank call and shit on you and was this, it was all in one, like four voices is tied to like a boyfriend boyfriends house. When I got the calls and I just put to silence, it was like blocked number. So I was like, I didn't think anything of it. And then like when I listened to it, like it was like some pretty horrific stuff. Like I definitely cried, you know, I was 17 years old. Um, and then the next day at school I took this like philosophy class and like, I don't know what the topic was. I don't know what prompted me to raise my hand and introduced what had happened last night as like, you know, a segway. Maybe I just needed to get off my chest. But like the teacher like spazzed out and was like, get up, we're going to the principal's office.

Speaker 2:          03:41          Like, you know, you have to report this. He brings me into the office. The principal like freaked out. Like she just like the language was like, you know, if it was shocking, you know. Um, and then she called like the resource officer and then like the next period of my life was like a blackout because it turned out that three of the kids I had never even met. Like they, this was like maybe some kids that had their first beer. One of the kids I was like friends with, but we were arguing because he was upset that I was like spending so much time with my boyfriend, but he's gay. Like he was, it wasn't like he just was like Jelly, like, you know, like just like I using Alpha everyday started hanging off my boyfriend was a stupid thing. Wasn't a hundred percent. Yeah, no, he's a 100% gay from what I'm told.

Speaker 2:          04:21          But um, yeah, so, uh, petty. Yeah. And then it was like, here are my three friends and they were all going to get drunk and call these, call this black girl. And you know, it's easy to say awful things until like this. Like you're don't have to look at a human being. Like it's easy to say awful things. But unfortunately for me, one of the people in the car happened to be the current governor of Connecticut Sun. So this turned from like some kids prank called to like said some awful things to like front page of the newspaper throughout the entire shift. Connecticut, a little bit in New York, Naacp outside of my school I have to, it was like this situation that was talk about outrage culture. My first like introduction to outrage culture and the things that sort of formed my thoughts. Like this was a very formative experience in my life.

Speaker 2:          05:08          Um, which to me it was, it was nonpolitical, but it was like my life wasn't mine. Like I went from like sitting down watching, I was watching Talladega nights with my boyfriend to being the most discussed person in the state of Connecticut. And what was interesting about it was just that because it was the governor of Connecticut sign that was in this car, they had to get the FBI involved to determine the authenticity of the like, like maybe she called herself right, they heal instead of just saying like, yes, it was my son. He actually let the FBI investigate for six weeks and waited for a son to get arrested six weeks late. You know what I mean? Like was just want to see if he can get away with it. Cause this is politics, you know what I mean? Like, can we get away within, is it plausible for us to get away with it?

Speaker 2:          05:47          You know, so six weeks of the entire state, I didn't, I left school. People were like fighting on my behalf, fighting our school home school. Yeah. Yeah. It was, it was just like, yeah, yeah. This was just like, it was like a monstrosity of a situation and it was one of those things where like literally like letters to the editor and be like, mom's like, talk about, you know, outrage culture. Right. I don't believe Candice, yeah, this happened, this girl, I believe she called herself like, I'm just looking for attention one night and I just decided to say I was going to hang by family from a tree. Isn't it funny that someone would even have an opinion on that? It's, it's bizarre. Like I believe her writes letters to the editor. Like I, the whole thing is weird retrospectively, right? Like I don't believe her, but that is what like life is about, right?

Speaker 2:          06:32          Like you have to write a youtube right now. I still know this is how you're gonna fucking, yeah, exactly. So it was the situation that like, it was just completely out of my control. And then as quick as it, how did these kids got arrested? And then as quick as it happened, it was over, um, for like everyone, but not for me. Are these kids, right, right. Like so I never wanted these kids to get arrested. Like if no one, like this whole situation was taken out of my hands. People thought I didn't go to the police and like my teacher went to the police. It turned into this do these kids were labeled publicly racists. Right? The youngest kid in the car, it was 14 I'm not comfortable with ever labeling a 14 year old racist. Right. Or any of these kids racist. These are kids and in my opinion, adults that failed to act like adults.

Speaker 2:          07:16          Adults that failed to take a step back and say, okay, why would, what would prompt these kids do this? Why is it so easy to be mean? Right. Why is it so easy nowadays for children to be mean and no one to me, like when I really thought about that, I went through like five years of like anorexia because of the situation. Because of that one and I was the victim. Yeah. And Yeah, you went through Anorexia. Yeah. Which is so weird now because like people that know me now, like there's no way you never didn't eat. But I did. I did like did not eat for like five years. I had issues with Anorexia because I mean I actually has a disease that genuinely is about control. It's about asserting control of your life. And I felt that I had my, like my life was fine and then like people took the narrative, um, and I can decide to determine what the narrative was. You're in your, you're a victim or maybe you're a liar, you know, you're, these kids are racist, these kids are this. And just nobody really thought that. Like you actually wrote all of our lives, right. Like for a little bit like these kids went on to have like Duis and get arrested and got into drugs and it was because of this outbreak of everything that happened. Yeah. And I was like, would have been totally cool with an apology. Like, you know what I mean? Like, sorry.

Speaker 1:          08:26          Well good for you for looking at it that way. And as that's hard to do because everybody loves when they are allowed to get outraged. Everybody loves get outraged. Obviously what they did to you was horrible. But I think a lot of kids, especially if they're drinking, they don't even understand how stupid and gross it is, what they do and they just know they can do it and they get a thrill out of it. And then there's that mob mentality when there's like a bunch of people together doing the same thing. Exactly. Amp it up and start saying crazy.

Speaker 2:          08:51          We understand the, when you just like think about it as a human being and not as somebody who has to opinion, like you're like, hey, we're going to call this black girl, right? You've got a bunch of kids were going to just say mean things to her on the phone and you don't have to look her in the face. Right? It's like if I hold up this pen and I'm like, just say mean stuff. Like someone's going to get, you could say anything to this pen. So it's, it's sort of, um, it, it was a formative experience that um, in retrospect I understand has so much to do with why I am who I am. Cause I hated that. Like that label obsessed culture and the outrage machine and then like, oh okay we're done. But like, you know, forget the people that whose lives we just like, no.

Speaker 2:          09:27          Do you know those people anymore? I don't, I I know like the siblings of them because I was friends. Like that's the thing, like one of the people that was involved, I was very good friends with his brother and it's like, you're just going to tell me this kid's like a racist. Like I actually knew the kid's mother, you know, like nobody cared. It was just a hot story. Really Racist. Just stupid. I mean stupid did something stupid and they do that. That was a way that they could scare you, right. That they could and they might've been drunk like drunk. Maybe it was their first beer. Right. But people can do well, the youngest was 14 the youngest and this person was labeled a racist. Like that's to me is like, that's harsh. People say, Oh, you're too forgiving. Labeled him a racist, they said was most certainly racist. Yes. The words are racist. Right. Can Somebody, I guess the question is, can somebody say something, say a word that is racist and not be a racist human being? Yes. I think now I'm going to tell you why. Yes. Okay. Okay.
