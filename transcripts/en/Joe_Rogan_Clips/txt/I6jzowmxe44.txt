Speaker 1:          00:00          I, I'm a fan of the best fighters in the world getting together and whatever we have to do to facilitate that, that's what I want to see happen. You know what I mean? I, you know, I just think that there's gotta be a way to make this happen. There's got to be, what are you talking about here? Yo Mother fucker. Hey Man. I mean, I'm just, I'm, I'm going, going day by day, you know, I'm enjoying the process. I mean we, we're in talks right now. Things are going, things are going smoothly, things are going, things are moving forward. We'll see. Uh, we'll see what happens. I mean, I know you have to say all this to say all that. No, I mean that's, but that, that is true. I mean, I want to fight the best guys in the world and know, oh, there's not a day.

Speaker 1:          00:41          There isn't a day that goes by that I don't get, I mean shoot, you posted that thing this morning and there was 287 likes and 30 or comments and, and you know, five minutes and it was all like, finally, hey, when are you going to go? When do you guys like I and I get that every single day. So there's not a day that goes by that, that I don't, it doesn't get talked about or thought about. But especially after anyone over there became the champion. Yeah. Right. And everybody knows about, I mean that's one of the things that I talked about when Eddie first came over to the UFC was go, I was telling people, go watch the wars that he had with Michael Chandler. And then I've said that also too, when I've seen you coaching people or being in someone's corner, I'm like, that right there is one of the best lightweights in the planet.

Speaker 1:          01:19          Yeah. And I just really would love to see you. I mean, I don't want to undercut Beltour. I don't want it to bell toward, you know, no, I mean it's at the end of the day, I mean there's, there's, it's a competition between the two. You know, the two organizations, there's guys in both organizations that are great, like you said, Lima and, and all these guys course correct off. I mean there's, you know, and the pit bull brothers or whatever. I mean there's, there's some great talent in both [inaudible] and you saw it back in the day with Strikeforce and now all of a sudden a lot of these Strikeforce guys are, you know, UFC champions as well, you know, so it's kind of interesting, weird the way fighting is today as opposed to the way boxing. It's like a perfect example is like, like the Gennady Golovkin fight this weekend. You know, we went to see him and you know, you go to your, you're basically going to see one of the best boxers on the planet.

Speaker 1:          02:06          You're not going to see him because he's, you know, the fucking WBC guy or the IBF guy or the Wbo. Oh yeah. People don't really give a shit about that. He's a world champion, but the the war, the one, but it's versus Bella tour versus the UFC. It's a big difference in the way people look at it. Like the average public, the people don't give a shit if you're the WBA champion in boxing or the WBC champion, they don't give a shit. They just want to know who's a bad motherfucker. Like is it, you know, is it Deontay wilder is an Anthony Joshua who these are heavyweight champions. Let's see him fight. They don't look at it that way. When it comes to Bella tour in the UFC. I don't know why I have my, my speculation is first of all, because UFC has been around forever and it's like the NFL, it has that name value tips and they've done a good job of building the name value.

Speaker 1:          02:58          It's also a really good name. Yeah, UFC is a great name. Bella. Tor is a shitty man. It just is. It's just, you know, you go to the, the average person like, oh, I'm going to watch Bella tour tonight. They're like, the fuck is up to her. They don't know what a Bella Torres, but ultimate fighting championship makes sense. It makes sense. I just wanted to just call it paramount MMA, I think. Uh, yeah. I mean I think there, I mean there was all kinds of new branding going on with the whole new paramount stuff and all that kind of stuff. I mean there, if there was ever a time it would have been now, but I mean, I think they're, they're stuck to it. They like it. I mean it's kind of one of them things. They should get their money back from spike Lee and when they had a pay spike Lee, did they?

Speaker 1:          03:35          Yeah, they paid them off. He was crazy. No, he was sued. He sued them. He said that you stole the name from me and they're like, what the fuck is basically just one of those frivolous lawsuits that you have to settle and they fine take bike wanting some cactus Gash, take this money. I want to how much they gave him. How much do you think they gave him? Let's, let's say, guess how much you think they gave Spike Lee? 3.2 million. Really that much? No, I don't know. I made that a million. If they have to give him a million, I bet they gave him a meal. I bet you're right. I'm going to go with 1.2 I'm going to, I'm going to be in the middle. I'm going to be the middle guy and see how much the guy, do you think they disclosed it? You think? Yeah, he did. He did. He like actually trademark spike TV and like someday he might actually have his own TV channel type of his, his thought was, well, what about Spike Jones? Is he like, where's my fucking money? Yeah. I think he just was felt like his name was so not like the named spike was synonymous with him. I don't know. No.
