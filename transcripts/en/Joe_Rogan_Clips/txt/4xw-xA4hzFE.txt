Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience, you know, I dunno what we're speaking of, but we need to talk about Kanye just, oh, Jamie's got crazy Kanye conspiracy theories. Slash. Theories. Well, first, so first of all, he's like, he came out for Trump recently, sort of, he wore a make America great again hat on, but he also called Trump a bald thief. Why suddenly too? He did. Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah, he called them balled crook or a Paul. Kanye is a lunatic. Yeah. So I could care less what he says about Amy loves saying, Jamie Sleeps with a picture of Kanye. I'll stop if you believe that she came to believe that. Come on people believe everything you were saying about me. It's not a, it's I, it's a pendant with a picture with his picture on in it. Jamie. A big fan of two things. Nuclear Weapons and Trump. He's, yeah, he loves nuclear bombs and he loves physics class.

Speaker 1:          01:05          Yeah. So Trump before, here's, here's what, here's what I like. I, well, Connie is a lunatic, but I do like Candace Owens who was also new on the scene and my Fox News world. You love that. I love you love conservatives and Candace is just like, she walked in from work the other day and I was like started listening to Fox News is on and of course I'm watching. I'm like, who the hell is this? You Say Fox News is on of course, because Fox News just blaring propaganda through your house all the time. Do you ever switch it up? Like have like CNN on the back, nine Fox News on in the living room. I watch it. I do watch CNN. Alex Jones says 200 1:30 PM to watch him for wars. Exclusive on Kenya's. Candice and Kanye like exclusive. I don't, it didn't happen. It's like alive. What is he going to say? Featuring canvas and Kanye. So I need a lump them in together. But he's he talking about them.

Speaker 2:          01:58          Everyone thought they were going to be on this show to you.

Speaker 1:          02:01          Oh, it didn't happen for a wars exclusive. He probably called them Kanye. It's Alex Jones. I could care less that Connie says. I like what canvas says. Well, Jamie thinks that all this wackiness with Candace Owens and Kanye is really Kanye just getting people hyped up about the release of his new album, which will be out in a few months. So he's getting people fired up. You think that's what's happening Jamie?

Speaker 2:          02:23          Yeah, there's a internet conspiracy that's been like, not proven because it can't be proven yet, but uh, there's a long Twitter thread and a few like reports now blogs or magazines if you will, that sort of lead to like an Andy Kaufman s type performance art piece that he's doing. Maybe bring up a conversation about some of these topics he's actually talking about. Or maybe we'll find out when his album comes out.

Speaker 1:          02:45          If Kanye is doing performance art, then what's the point? Here's the, here's the problem is a certain amount of him that is undeniably insane. And um, you've seen that, like that thing that Jimmy Kimmel mocked where you had that little kid, he used to do little kids saying things that Kanye said and like he would have like, really? Yeah. Like he would have little kids say exactly by the way, hate him. He's a nice guy. No, you meant to be like him. I want to go. I, he's like, why he cries about hunting.

Speaker 3:          03:26          Okay.
