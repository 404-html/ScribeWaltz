Speaker 1:          00:00          Uh, anything else? Yeah. So I was going to bring this up at the beginning, but the golden snitch, that's first of all, that's Brendan Shop's name. He gave it to you. So taking on a life of its own. And I think, I think, you know, the last time we talked about Donna asking Alexa, who won the gold is the gold, isn't it? Yes. Let me see that. We'll see what Siri says. Hold on a second. Let's see what Siri says, but I've never tried this. Hold on a second.

Speaker 2:          00:28          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:28          Who is the Golden Snitch?

Speaker 2:          00:31          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:31          he's some inflammation. Wow. Oh yeah. Quiet itch. It's something in Harry Potter. Yeah. Which I didn't know is that the last time on? And I mentioned, you know, it was in, I think my Wikipedia profile. It had me as Aka the golden snitch and somebody took that knows, Hey Siri, who is the golden snitch?

Speaker 2:          00:53          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54          Oh, Siri. Siri keeps going with the quad itch. So someone took it down from, what did they do that well, I think we talked about, you're like, Eh, I dunno. They, they just did it very valuable. Um, so I think I told you about us backup already. Coworkers call me at, yes, my family calls me. They call you the goldens friends calling me. I was at the MMA awards last year and some Yahoo had a few pops of back at me is screaming in between presentations, the golden snitches. I'm slinking down in my chair, my girlfriend and I are, it is damn the golden stitch is backup already. See on the end that the popped up. Beautiful. Just, just fucking when they do that, just put your hands up in the air. Make a shake you one. So you know, definitely should make a shirt during shows all sit pretty close to the cage.

Speaker 1:          01:41          Go out in between a fight into the bathroom and it's not Joe Rogan level half the damn arena standing up. Excited to see you walking in and out of the fight or walk. But two or three people in that walk when I go backstage to check on each side of the golden snitch. So give them wrecking, you know Steve Reed, you know, so you've read our bald security, that bad ass looking guy on stage. He'll come back stage just mate, they're calling me the snitch out there, man. I think I'm you that for God pays for it. Um, we were in teams. A scary guy, dude. He's a great dude. That guy is at the top of his game. Insecurity. Just background. Fucking unbelievable. Yeah. I saw him one time in Las Vegas during a fight. He was sitting on the floor. Something's happened in the fight. The crowd goes fucking bananas and everybody stands up on the floor.

Speaker 1:          02:28          Steve stands up and just motions sit down in the entire fucking section. Sat down 200 plus people. I'm like toot if you can, without even having to touch somebody, just stand up by your presence alone and control something like that. I mean, the best I've ever seen, he's legit. As it gets down to, are you going to do anything to market this? Well, that's getting to my story here. It's not marketing, but let me finish the story here. I'm in Chicago this year. I think there was a paper view. You were there, right? Yes. So something happened and I was late to the arena and they had cut off kind of the loading dock. I couldn't get to it. So I had my oldest daughter with me. And so we're having to walk through where all the crowds walking in and you know, Dude's all of golden snitch.

Speaker 1:          03:12          Hey, can we get a picture golden snitch. My daughter's like, what the fuck is going on? How old is your daughter? So she's 22 so two days ago, Christmas morning, I'm opening up presence. So I get the presence for my daughters, the three of them, and my middle daughter's very artistic. And so they create these cool sculpted beer mugs and there's four of them. One of them's like Bald Guy Brewing Novitsky something and one of them says golden snitch brewing company. So it's cool looking thing. And she, she drew me a black and white kind of rendition of all four, which I'm gonna hang up really cool. So then my girlfriend's there, so she hands me the box and she's been telling me all launches. I got you the best fucking present ever in the history of presence. I'm like, the hell is this? So I opened up the box.

Speaker 3:          03:58          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:58          Oh my. She's got this series of tee shirts and I think, what size are you? Large. Large. There we go man. So you, since you created it, you literally and figuratively have to wear it. Now this is outrageous. So that picture there, there's some,

Speaker 3:          04:22          oh,

Speaker 1:          04:25          say who you go baby ladies, gentlemen, circle close. Look at that. So I posted a boot on this or something that's can king series Moscow, I think I can say this. Hopefully they'll let me back in, but it's out in front of KGB or FSP headquarters to that building in the background is KGB. F has now known as FSB. Oh Wow. So yeah. So I posted a picture of, she got me like 20 shirts. I put them on not to private Instagram, Facebook. Everybody in the world's like, take my money man. Where can I get one? I'm wearing the weigh ins tomorrow. Alright, you guys create it. You've got to own it now. I got one for shop too that you can throw the shops mad at you. Is He? Yeah. He's, he called you the golden wrap now changed. I thought maybe you got him in here.

Speaker 1:          05:21          He's in for misinformed. He thinks first of all that you were an employee of, you saw it. Oh, there you go. And that now you're an employee or the UFC. Uh, he's misinformed about that and I think he, he likes to call skeptical. He skeptical hippo. I am skeptical as well, but I, one thing that I've learned from doing this podcast over the years is that there's no fucking way there's, it's an, it's impossible to know everything. It is impossible and you have to rely on the expertise of the people who have spent a lifetime studying these things. It's very important. Here's another thing. There's no way these people could be lying about this and it wouldn't massively damaged. There we are going forward. It'd be done. They, someone would find out, someone would get to them, the other scientists without them. There would be studies done, there would be papers done.

Speaker 1:          06:15          The Internet would find out about it. Everybody would know. There's no way. It's, it's pretty unprecedented in writing with the lack of the studies. There were Chenko one being the my sanding even right. How do you say it? [inaudible] yeah, it's pretty unprecedented that they would put these absolutes in writing. Um, you know, with this law, you know, I think they looked at it very hard and detailed and obviously they weren't quick and turning it around and we would have loved this decision to be made a lot earlier so we could have rooted and vetted out with Nevada. But they did indeed, you know, sign their names to these pretty absolute statements and what, what else can the UFC and I do, um, when these experts are putting those absolutes out there and I get the people go, oh, could you actually do, you got to understand folks, this would be career suicide.

Speaker 1:          07:01          This is, this is the, this is cutting edge science we're talking about there's too many people that would have a vested interest in calling bullshit. It's, it's not something they don't fuck around when it comes to these things that people that are at the, the front of the line, when it comes to catching people on these things and the science that they're important, they're, they're, they're, they're involved with. It's, this is not, you get, you can't like gas on the outside with no education. It's just not wise. And this is what I keep seeing over and over again is people that have some knowledge, a little bit of knowledge, and they're, they're pretending that they're, they have a phd in this shit go. I mean, for those that want to do more detective work, go read Mclaren's written decision on John's July, 2018 July, 2018 tests. Go read the rich Hank off study on the DHC empty and the metabolites and go read the recent clomiphene, um, study where it shows is chlorinated substance. It's pulsing, it goes away, comes back higher than before. It goes away, comes back, lower, goes away, comes back higher. Crazy stuff. Okay. Um, we're good.
