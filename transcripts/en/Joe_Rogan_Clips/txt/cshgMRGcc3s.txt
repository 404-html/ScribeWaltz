Speaker 1:          00:00          Open sources self in, in its title, pretty much people kind of understand what it is. It means that various coders get to share in this, this code and the source code and they they get to innovate and they all get to participate and use each other's work. Right, right. Um, but blockchain is confusing for a lot of people. Could you explain that?

Speaker 2:          00:22          Sure. I'm in Blah Blah. Blockchain itself is almost a misnomer. So we're confusing. Things are confusing at, at the, at every level, right. So we can, we should start with the idea of a distributed ledger, which is basically like a distributed excel spreadsheet or database. It's just a store of information which is not stored just in one place where there's copies of it in a lot of different places. Every time my copy of it is updated, everyone else's copy of it has, has, has got to be updated. And then then there's various bells and whistles like sharding where you know, it can be broken in many pieces and each piece is stored many places or something. So That's a distributed ledger and that's just distributed computing. Now what? What makes it more interesting is when you layered decentralized control onto that. So imagine you have this distributed excel spreadsheet or distributed database.

Speaker 2:          01:16          There's copies of it stored in a thousand places, but to update it, you need like 500 of those thousand people who own the copies to vote. Yeah, let's do that update, right? So then then you have a distributed store of data and you have like a democratic voting mechanism to determine when all those copies can get can get updated together. Right. So then then what you have is a data storage and update mechanism that's controlled in a democratic way by the group of participants rather than money one central controller. And that that can have all sorts of advantages. I mean for one thing it means that you know, there's no one controller who can go rogue and screw with other day without telling anyone. It also means there's no one who some lewd taking go hold a gun to their head and shoot them for for what data updates from aid because the, you know, it's controlled democratically by bye everybody.

Speaker 2:          02:08          Right. It has ramifications in terms of, you know, legal defensibility and I mean you could have some people in Iran, some in China, some in the u s and and updates to this whole distributed data store are made by democratic decision of all the participants somewhere cryptography comes in is when I vote, I don't have to say, yeah, this is Ben Goertzel voting for this update to be accepted or not. It's just ID number one, three, five, seven, two, six, four and then encryption is used to make sure that, you know, it's, it's the same guy voting every time that it claims to be without needing like your, your passport number or something. Right. What's ironic about it,

Speaker 1:          02:51          it's probably one of the best ways ever conceived to actually vote in this country. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:56          sure. And it would be kind of ironic. There's a lot of applications for the [inaudible], right? So there's so that, I mean that's the core mechanism. Now where the block chain comes from is like a data structure where to store the data in this distributed database, it's stored in a chain of blocks or each block contains data. The thing is not every so-called blockchain system even uses a chain of blocks and I would like some user, a tree or a graph of blocks or something. So that term, I mean it's, it's an all right term like AI, like just one of those terms were stuck with one of the, it's one of those terms were stuck with, even though it's not quite technically not quite technically accurate. I mean any more, I mean cause w w, W, W I don't know another buzzword for it, right.

Speaker 2:          03:46          What it is is a, it's a distributed ledger with encryption and decentralized control and blockchain is the buzzword that's come about for that. Now, what, what got me interested in blockchain really is this decentralized control aspect. So my, my wife, who I've been with for 10 years now, she dug up recently something I'd forgotten, which is a webpage and made in 1995 like a long time ago, where I'd said, hey, I'm going to run for president on the decentralization platforms. Right. Which I'd completely forgotten that, that crazy idea. I was very young then. I had no idea what an annoying job being president would be. Right. But the, so that the idea of decentralized control seem very important to me. Back then, which is well before bitcoin was invented because I could see, you know, a global brain is evolving on the planet involving humans, computers, communication devices.

Speaker 2:          04:42          And we don't want this global brain to be controlled by, by a small elite. We want the global parent to be controlled in a, in a decentralized way. So, right. So that, that's really the, the beauty of this a blockchain infrastructure. And what, what got me interested in the practical technologies of blockchain was really one etherium came out and you add the notion of a smart contract, which etherium yeah. So what does that, well, so the first blockchain technology was Bitcoin, right? Which is a well known cryptocurrency. Now etherium is another cryptocurrency, which is the number two cryptocurrency right now. That's all a loop I am. Did you know about it? He did. However, ethereum came along with a really nice software framework. So it's not just like a digital money like bitcoin is, but it theory, IOM has a programming language called solidity that came with it and this programming language, let's see, right, where they're called smart contracts.

Speaker 2:          05:46          And again, that sort of a misnomer because the smart contract doesn't have to be either smart or a contract, right? But it was a cool name, right? Right. Then if it's really a smart, it's a chart. It's like a programmable transaction. Okay. So you can program a legal contract or you can program of a financial transaction. So as a smart contract, it's a, it's a persistent piece of software that embodies like a secure encrypted transaction between, between multiple parties. So pretty much like anything on, on the back end of a bank's website or a transaction between two companies online, a purchasing relationship, which you and the website online. This could all be scripted in the smart contract in this secure way. And then it would be automated and it's simple and standard way. So the vision that Vitalik Buterin who was the main creator behind the theory I'm head is to basically make the internet into a giant computing mechanism rather than mostly like an information storage and retrieval mechanism, make the Internet into a giant computer, but making a really simple programming language for scripting transactions among different computers and different parties on the Internet where you have encryption and you have democratic decision making and distributed storage of information like programmed into this, this world computer.

Speaker 2:          07:14          Right? And then that was a really cool idea. And the, and blockchain and solidity programming language made it really easy to do that. So it made it really easy to program like distributed secure transaction and computing systems on the Internet. So I saw this, I thought, well like now we finally have the tool set that's needed to implement some of the sources is very popular. I mean, I mean basically almost every ICO that was done the last couple of years was done on the ethereum blockchain. What's an ICO? Initial coin offering. Okay. So for Bitcoins, for crypto currencies use this technology offerings. Right? So what happened in the last couple of years is a bunch of people realized you could use this etherium programming framework to create a new cryptocurrency like a new artificial money and then you could try to get people to use your new artificial money for certain types of Honi artificial coins.

Speaker 2:          08:23          Maybe more, but I mean how many popular is bitcoin? Bitcoin is bitcoin is by far the most popular delirium is number two and there's a bunch of others. I mean how quick comparison like how much bigger is bitcoin and ethereum? I Dunno, five factor factor of three to five so maybe just a factor of two. Now it's actually last year at theory I'm almost took over bitcoin when bitcoin are crashing. Yeah, yeah. Now I him is back down. It might be half or a third of that for you, the fluctuating value of these things to my, to my mind, creating artificial monies is one tiny bit of the potential of what you could do with the whole blockchain tool set it. It happened to become popular initially, right, because it's where the money is, right? I've been right. It is. It is money and that's interesting to people.

Speaker 2:          09:23          But on the other hand, what it's really about is making the world's computer, it's about scripting with a simple programming language, all sorts of transactions between people, companies, whatever, all sorts of exchanges of information. So I'm, it's about decentralized voting mechanisms. It's about Ai's being able to send data and processing it for each other and, and pay each other for their transactions. So I'm in the, there's, it's about automating supply chains and, and shipping and ecommerce so that there's, in essence, you know, just like computers and the Internet started with a certain small set of applications and then pervaded almost everything, right? It's the same way with blockchain technology, like it started with digital money, but the core technology is going to pervade almost everything because there's almost no domain of human pursuit that couldn't use like security through cryptography, some sort of, you know, participatory decision making and then distributed storage of information.

Speaker 2:          10:32          Right? So, and these things are also valuable for AI, which is how I got into it in the first place. I mean, if you're making a very, very powerful AI that is going to, you know, gradually through the practical value delivers, he will grow up to be more and more and more intelligent. I mean, this AI should be able to engage a large party of people and ais and participatory decision making. They, I should be able to store information, you know, when a widely distributed way and, and AI certainly should be able to use, you know, security and encryption devalidate who are the parties in involved in its operation. And I mean, these are the key things behind, behind blockchain technology. So I'm in the fact the fact that blockchain began with artificial currencies, to me is a detail of history. Just like the fact, the fact that the Internet began as like a nuclear early warning system, right? It did. It's good for that, but it's, as it happens, it's also even better for a lot of other things.
