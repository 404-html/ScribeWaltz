Speaker 1:          00:44          I was talking to a guy the other day that had meant breath over shit breath so confused. Told him that his breath smelled like shit. And so he was eating mince but it wasn't good enough. So it was like I was, it was, you know what it was like, man. It was like, it was confusing. It was like there's two signals that were clashing with each other. What's awful for the folks listening at home that aren't broadcasters, I'm not naming names, we're not going to name any names to broadcasts with somebody who's breasts because they turned to you and you'd have to stay close to him to stay in the two shot. That's a problem. You can't go, you can't react to it all. And it is, I brush my teeth like religiously when I'm doing camera stuff because I'm in someone's face talking to them and I've been on the receiving end of that and been like this, you can't do it after shows.

There's a, there's a so, so typically I guess the, so the chemicals, I guess the sulfur that everybody has different compounds in their mouth and for whatever reason, I don't know. But they're there. They essentially what you're smelling is sulfur is a derivative of sulfur, some kind of assault. And it's because there's a chemical problem in your mouth and they can actually address it with yeah. And I was like, tell him to tell us, this can also be from bad from liver disease. So if you have a liver disease, you don't shut liver disease, diabetes, liver disease, stuff like about the breath.

Speaker 1:          02:34          Wow. Wow. That's interesting. Yeah. That's one of the ways they check. Yeah. Whoa. And then of course it can be uh, an abscess behind your tooth and all that. Yeah, that's a big one, man. That's what everyone's [inaudible] and diabetes diabetics. Dude, I had a cracked filling and they took the filling out. Oh. And the fucking smell that came out of my mouth, I was like, Holy Shit. Cause the, the filling had cracked and there was an infection. I had a wound up getting a root canal. And so as I'm getting this list thing like opened up, they break through this pocket. We're all this puss and rot is, yeah. Oh Dude, it was so nasty. Sounds awful. It like you could hear it like pop through and then just this fucking shit breath. They can't fires. My father is fine. He was sleeping. His wife said, you have to go to the dentist said, why does your breath is so out of control? And they'd been married for 25 years. So he goes, Jesus. All right, so, so, so check this out. This is so apparently he had an abscess, a sack of bacteria in the back of his mouth. Well, when they, when they, I guess took the tooth out of the filling out and they popped by accident, the sac, the nurse threw up fucking dentist. The dentist walked into the room at that moment and through to fuck up as well. [inaudible]

Just barely diamond. I like that. Oh my God, that's so cool. I never had the balls to tell someone that breath stay with them. You have, if you work with them, you have to help friends. I would want them to tell me like your breath stinks. I'm going to tell you and I would want you to tell me. It's one cool thing about black people. They'll tell you they will lay it on the, I have no block or some shit. Fucking pussy. I once got head from a girl. They would, she was, she would come over and give me a massage. She wasn't very good looking, but she was down and give them a song. By the time you're done with the massage, she knows she's going to get to, she wanted to give me oral pleasure long time ago, but she used her teeth. Oh boy. I didn't have the fucking courage to tell her that. I'm like, I was enjoying it, but I was like, ah.

Speaker 1:          05:23          She's looking at me. [inaudible] every time she came over right. Here we go. [inaudible] a girl's pussy can reek and I'm not going to tell him. I'm not telling me, I don't know. I gotta be a gentleman, but okay. But if you're a girl and you, you have a problem, you have a yeast infection, and if someone doesn't let you know, you're not going to get treated. Like there's a problem. It's true. It's delicate. It's a delicate surgery. What's happening is you're not always going to get a rational reaction. Thank you. Medically I feel much better. That's not going to be the action mad at you. Isn't that weird? They'll get mad at you if they're pussies. Well, there was a girl that, I was in New York. I was a young man and she was very sexy and uh, I feel like the incredible hulk, how music should be playing right now.

I was like, it was like 20. Thanks. Thanks. All right, whatever. To ballgames. And she and I, we got to business and then she began to give me oral pleasure after she was, I had gotten her kind of naked and she and Harry, but she had a hairy back. Like you know, some people can be super dark hair and it was far as that. It was fine for buying firms. Very girl it was girl for, but it's still a problem bro, because they, the hair fanned out. It started with the back end. It was on the old rumper still skins and that was very hard for me to keep it.

Speaker 1:          07:05          I couldn't, I had to avert my eyes. The only black girl. What was the instinct to laugh more? To be like she, here's what the instinct was.

And you know what? She did her a favor.

You want me to be honest? So I said, our breath was so bad I could smell it when we're standing at the elevator. And she screamed. She went, oh my God. We always felt that way. And they were friends there and I said, none of you told her her life is, she'll never find somebody if you don't tell her. I couldn't tell her. Right. Guys will tell you quick like a group of guys and I'd be like, Joe, you got to take care of this now. Yeah, yeah. I'm a guy friends.
