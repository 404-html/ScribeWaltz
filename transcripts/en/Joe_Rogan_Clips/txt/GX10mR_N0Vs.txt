Speaker 1:          00:00          I, uh, I'm a big fan of your work. I've read much of your work. I've seen many of your interviews and videos online. And, uh, one of the things that I really wanted to talk to you about it I find quite interesting is consciousness and your belief that consciousness is not simply calculation, but that there's something more to it and what, what you think this more could possibly be from a scientific perspective, which is unusual because a lot of people have some theories about consciousness, but they're usually crazy people like myself. Well, I mean, we were all conscious and so we may have theories about it. Yeah. But now the ideas came by a somewhat round about route. Uh, I, I went to Cambridge to do graduate work. It was mathematics. I was working on pure mathematical subjects, Algebra, geometry. But I thought, you know, we've got three years.

Speaker 1:          00:56          I'll spend some of the time going to other talks that might be interesting. So I went to three talks particularly, which had a big influence on me. One was taught by Herman Bondi with, uh, um, general relativity cosmology, wonderful tour. We're very sort of animated presentation, the ad and then there was a talk by Paul Dirac, one of the founders of quantum mechanics and HIStalk what he's completely wonderful talk to wonderful lectures as well, but in a completely different style. He was very quiet and precise in what he said and everything. Anyway, in the very first lecture he was talking about the superposition principle in quantum mechanics. So if you have a particle and it could be in one spot or it could be in another spot, then you have all sorts of states where it can be in both places at once. That's sort of strange, but you got to get used to that idea and he illustrated with his speech a piece of chalk and I think he broke it in two to illustrate it could be in one spot or in the other.

Speaker 1:          01:57          And my mind sort of wondered at that point, I didn't know what I was thinking about, but I wasn't concentrating. And about a few minutes later he'd finished, his description is explanation and I had some vague memory of something about energy, but I didn't understand what he said. And I've been totally mystified by this ever since. So I, I suppose if I had heard what he said, he would have said something to calm me down and I sort of accepted in one way or another. But as it was, it seemed to me this was a major issue. How on earth do you have things that don't behave according to what quantum mechanics says? Like cricket balls and baseballs and things like that. Anyway, that's two of the talks. The other course was a course by a man called Stephen, who talked on mathematical logic and he explained things like girdle's theorem and touring machines during machines being the mathematical notion upon which modern computers are based or computers basically.

Speaker 1:          02:59          And uh, uh, the thing about good will stay. Let me see. I'd heard, I used to have a colleague when I was undergraduate in Percival who also became a scientist's later on. And we talked about, uh, logic and you know, how you could make this kind of mathematical systems, which worked out logic. And I'd heard about this girls and which seemed to say that there were things in mathematics that you just couldn't prove. And I didn't like that idea, but I, when I heard the, when I went to this course by Steen and he explained what it really says and what it says, it's suppose you've got a method of proving things in mathematics. And when I say things, I mean things with numbers. That one famous example is fair Mars last year, um, uh, there's the Gold Goldberg conjecture, which isn't yet proved that they every even number bigger than two is the sum of two prime numbers.

Speaker 1:          04:02          This the sort of example of the thing, it's just sort of mathematical things about numbers, which you can see what they mean. Uh, but it may be very difficult to see whether it's true or untrue. But the idea it often is in mathematics, you've got a system of methods of proof. And the key thing about these methods of proof is that you can have a computer check whether you've done it right. So you, these rules, you know, they could be adding in B, it's the same as BNA and things like that. And you, um, if you give you say to the computer, say, here's a theory, I'm like Goldbar conjecture and you see whether it can be proved and you say, maybe I've got a proof and this follows these steps and you give it to the computer and it says, Yep, you've done it right.

Speaker 1:          04:55          It's true. Or maybe it will say you've done it right and it's not true. Or it may not see anything but just go on forever. But these are the sort of outcomes. And the point about it is that if you believe that these procedures do give you a proof, in other words, that if the algorithm says, yeah, it's true, then you believe that it is true because you've understood the, all the rules. He looked at the first one, so yeah, that's okay. You look at the second one says, mom. Oh yeah, I see. Okay, that's great. And you go all the way down and as long as you convinced all those rules work and if it says yes, that's something you believe. Okay, now what girl shows as he constructs a very specific sentence, a statement which is a number thing like like the fair, most lost their arm or something.

Speaker 1:          05:43          I think about numbers, which what he shows is if you trust this algorithm for proving mathematical things, then you can see by the way it's constructed that it's true, but you can also see by the way it's constructed that it cannot be proved by this procedure. Now, this was amazing to me because it tells me that, okay, you cannot formalize your understanding in a scheme which you could put on a computer that you see. This statement which got will comes up with is something you can see on the basis of the same understanding that allows you to trust the rules that it's true, but that is not actually derives bubble by the rules. It you see, it's true by virtue of your belief in the rules. And this to me was amazing and I thought, Golly, you know, what's understanding, what does it mean? Is it something following rules?

Speaker 1:          06:49          This is an algorithm. Well this more or less says it's not an algorithm because whenever it was, there will be something that you could still see his true even though you don't get it through the algorithm that you had in the first place. So this was a lot of subtleties about this too, which people argue about endlessly. But it was pretty convincing to me that the shows that we don't think when we understand something that what's going on in our heads is not an algorithm. It's not following rules, it's something else. It's something that requires our conscious appreciation of what we're thinking about. I'm thinking it's a conscious thing and understanding is a conscious activity. So I formed the view that conscious activities, whatever they are, not just that kind of thing, but you know, playing music or we're falling in love or whatever these things might be on, not computations.

Speaker 1:          07:45          There's something else going on. And then I thought, because I like to think myself as a scientist and I think that what's going in our heads is according to the laws of physics and these laws of physics, um, pretty good. They seem to work well in the outside world and so I believe that the laws that work in our heads are the same as those laws. So I began to think about it, well, what about Newton's mechanics? But you could put that on a computer. What about Einstein's special relativity? You could do that. What about Maxwell's was wonderful equations, which tell you how less electricity and magnetism operates and lights and the radio waves and all these things. That's all follows this beautiful set of equations that Max will produced. You can put that on a computer. Okay. Then you may have to worry about approximations and these depend on continuous numbers rather than discreet things, but I didn't think that's the answer.

Speaker 1:          08:42          Then I thought, what about general relativity and Stein's theory of gravity with cove space and all that, where you were familiar now with Lego, this detector, which is detected black hole spiraling into each other from distant galaxy and how do we know that those signals are black holes, but well, because of the calculations, people who put this thing on an algorithm and you know what those signals look like. So Einstein's general relativity, sure you can put that in a cubicle on the computer. What about quantum mechanics? Well, there's the famous equation of Schrodinger, which tells you how a quantum state evolves. You could put that on a computer too. It's difficult in many ways. There's many more parameters you have to worry about, but it's just as comfortable as these other things. Well, you see, I then remembered directs lecture. You see and how it is that these things that work in the quantum world don't seem to work at the level of classical big things.

Speaker 1:          09:45          And it all depends on this process of what's called measurement in quantum mechanics. And the measurement process is something you learn how to do, but it's not the Schrodinger equation. It's something else. And Schroeder, he himself was very intrigued by this fact that his own equation, it gives you nonsense and you put the famous Schrodinger's cat where he produces a situation in which the cat would be dead and alive at the same time. He produced that in example simply to demonstrate that roughly speaking, his equation gives you nonsense under these circumstances. So there's something else and the something else goes beyond our current quantum mechanics. And it tells you what happens when the quantum state makes a decision between, doesn't follow the Schrodinger and does one thing or the other. No, everybody knows that who does quantum mechanics, but they think, oh, it's what's called making a measurement and you're allowed to do something different.

Speaker 1:          10:43          But that didn't make sense to me. And so I had the view that, okay, there is a big gap and our understanding and if there's something in the world which isn't something you could put on a computer, that's where it is. So the view, I've held that for a long time and uh, that there's something non computable, something beyond computation involved in our understandings of things. So that's a view of health for ages. I didn't do much with it. I just held the view until, I think there was a radio talk between Marvin Minsky and Edward Fred kin and they were explaining about what computers can do. And they were talking about, okay, you have a computer, two computers talking to each other over there and you walk up to the room and the time you've walked up the room to the computers, they have computed, commuted, communicates with each other more thoughts than the human race ever has done.

Speaker 1:          11:39          You see? And I thought, well, I see where you're coming from, but I don't think that's what's happening in, in human communication. Human understanding is something different from what computers do. And consciousness is the key thing. Consciousness is something different from computation. So I've held that view. But then when I heard this talk by Minsky and um, and Fred skin, I thought, well, I had ideas of writing a book some time. In a long time in the future when I'm retired, this is some while back, I said, and I thought, well, maybe this gives you the focus. And so I wrote this book called the emperor's new mind, which was supposed to be saying, well, you know, we, everybody seems to be thinking one thing, but yeah, the little kid notices that the emperor doesn't have any clothes. So it was the, uh, that theme of that story, which was the basis of the book.

Speaker 1:          12:33          So I say, okay, maybe a lots of people think that all we're doing is computing, but if you stand back and you say, well, no, there's something else going on. So that was the basis of my thoughts about consciousness. But I wrote this book thinking that by the time I got to the end of the book, you see, it was mostly about physics and mathematics and things like that. But I was really aiming for this thing about what's going on in conscious thinking. And I thought, well, I'll learn a bit about neurophysiology and so on. And by the time I get to the end of the book, uh, know pretty well what it could be. I didn't got to the end of the book and I just sort of tapered off rather than with something a little bit unbelievable. And that was the end. Now you see, I hope that this book would stimulate young people to get interested in science and that sort of thing, that mathematics.

Speaker 1:          13:26          And that was fine. And when the book was published, I didn't get letters from young kids. I got letters from old retired people who, the ones who had the time to read my book. Okay, well that was a little disappointing, but okay, I'm glad the old retired people like my book. But the other thing was I got a letter from the Stuart Hameroff and this letter said more or less, I think you don't appreciate that there's something else going on. Not Neurons. I mean the neurons, I could see you couldn't isolate the quantum effects that the, you get the what's called an environmental decoherence will happen and you get no way of keeping the quantum state to the level that you need in this picture. So I really, I didn't have it, but Stuart Hameroff pointed out to me these little things called microtubules and he'd built up a theory that microtubules are absolutely fundamental.

Speaker 1:          14:21          The consciousness. He had his own reasons for believing that I had never heard of them at that time, but then I checked up, you know, I get lots of letters from people who maybe don't make sense sometimes the letters and this one I thought, well this is another one. I realized these microtubules are there and they looked like just the kind of thing that could well be supporting the kind of level of quantum mechanics up to a level where you could expect the the quantum state to sort of collapse. That's the terminology. People using quantum mechanics microtubules, they are inside brain neurons. The R and D, and this is a recent discovery for them. They're actually in lots of cells. You see, people often complain, oh, they're in your liver too, not just your brain and your liver conscious and all that. But this has to do with the organization of them and the nature of them, the particular kind of microtubules, how they're, how they're arranged, which is different in the brain.

Speaker 1:          15:16          How does it vary in the brain compared to other cells? I think one big difference, so they're not Stewart emphasizes, there's so much, there are two kinds of microtubules. They're the ones who have a lattice [inaudible] lattice and the a lattice ones are the very symmetrical ones. There are tubes and they look the same all the way around. They've got a very beautiful arrangement of these proteins called Tubulin and they make a very nice arrangement, which is connected with Fibonacci numbers and things like that. So they look a bit like for cones, but there were powerful. They're not, they don't taper off. But, um, the thing is in the brain, I think most of microtubules are probably what to call lattice ones. And they're don't have so much symmetry. They've got like a sort of seemed on the one side and they're very important in transporting some substances around cells and so on.

Speaker 1:          16:09          And Microsoft was all sorts of things. They don't just do what, what Stuart and I think they may be doing in the brain. So the idea is that in the brain they're organized differently and probably the ones that are important have a lattice ones, which are the very symmetrical ones. And for a long time people couldn't see the difference and um, cause they look very similar. Um, and they may well be the ones that happened to be in pyramidal cells as a particular kind of cell. So, you know, one of the things I'm interested in me a lot is how it is that not all parts of the brain are the same in this respect is that you've got the cerebrum, this is the part at the top and you know, divided down the middle on that. When you see brains, that's what you normally see with the convolutions in, in the, in it, but right underneath and at the back there's a thing called the cerebellum, which more it looks more like a, like a ball of wool or something.

Speaker 1:          17:03          And the Cerebellum, I don't, it may still be argument about this, but it seems to be that it's completely unconscious and it has comparable number of neurons, far more connections between neurons and the cerebrum. And it's what takes control. And maybe when you're driving your car and you're thinking about something else and you, you don't, you're not thinking what you're doing because it's unconscious and the unconscious control, you know, pianist is very expert and moves the fingers around and plays a note with a little finger. That pns doesn't think, well, I've got to move that muscle this way and this mountain that way and so on. And it's, it's all controlled unconsciously in a lot of this unconscious control is done somewhere else in the cerebellum when you, when you get really skilled. So, uh, it seemed to me, okay, you've got different kinds of structures different and it could well be that these pyramidal cells, which have a particular organization of microtubules are the ones that were, that consciousness is really coming, coming to light mainly, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          18:06          There's a lot which is, which is not known about this controversial and all sorts of things, but the cerebellum seems to be different and organized differently. So it's not just how many neurons, how many connections are there because there are more in the cerebellum. So it's not that saying else. Do they know this from observing the brain through Fmr rye or something like that during particular activities? I don't know. I would imagine partly just examining it went from dead people and looking at brains and trying to estimate how many neurons their own it. Right. But how would they know what, which part? Partial, which is consciousness. I don't know that they do know that. Well I guess. But the co, the Cerebellum, there was a bit of an argument about that. I thought whether it's completely unconscious or not, but it seems that actions that are carried out by the Cerebellum, you don't, you're not aware of what you're doing.

Speaker 1:          18:57          But I mean it's, you know, if he had a tennis player who has to think very carefully about where that w with tilt the ball now the control of what you're doing. So the overall control, it's probably done with the cerebrum, but the cerebellum is controlling the detailed motions, how the fingers move and all that kind of thing. And then you'd make sure that if you play a, thinks it's going to hit the ball down, down the line there. And then the, the rest is done under the control of an unconscious procedure. I mean, I may be simplifying, but you're saying, so you're saying that there's, we don't totally understand, but we know that there's different parts of the brain that are responsible for different activities and some activities don't seem to be conscious. Yes, yes. And I think it's probably the case. No, I'm, I'm maybe, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          19:49          I shouldn't make a statement and I don't really know. But certainly there are lots of different parts of the cerebrum which maybe, which maybe not conscious too, so I'm not saying that the whole thing is capable of being conscious. It's, they seem to be differences in different parts. But are you convinced that microtubules are responsible for consciousness or its primary theory? I think they're the one of the best candidates. I you see, I don't think it's only microtia. I Dunno. I'm not sure what Stuart Hameroff sphere on this is. He certainly thinks the microchip was exceedingly important in consciousness and I think he's right. That's the feeling I get. And he's done a lot of work on trying to find a what? Anesthetic gases. It's an important, one of the important ways you can tell things about conscious and most of it you can't. It's just hearsay.

Speaker 1:          20:40          And what does it vary? It is, but one of the important ways you can tell something about consciousness is turns it off in a reversible way. In Stuart's job is, do you know he's an anesthesiologist? He puts people to sleep well. I think he would complain if I say putting it to sleep because under anesthetic is actually different for sleep. But you make them unconscious in a reversible way. You want to make sure thank, you can wake them up again. And a, it's obviously a very skills thing, but I guess a lot of his colleagues might be a skilled at doing it, but don't. They asked the questions about what they're actually doing from the point of view of the biology and the physics and so on. So still it was really interested in that question. Partly I think the thing is like, oh my tosas cell division and he was very struck by the way that the chromosomes or lion lion up and that there's these microtubules which pulling them and they're really a big part in, in, in, in the structure of cells and how they, how they behave and so on.

Speaker 1:          21:45          But why they are consciousness. Well, I guess it was an experience with, with um, putting people under anesthetics and the fact that the gases which puts you to sleep. And there, again, I shouldn't say to sleep, but put you on the anesthetic. I, I'm very unconnected chemically. They're different kinds of things be yet they still seem to have the same effect and to understand what it is that they affect is, you know, there's a lot of his interest is to do with that. So just by putting someone unconscious and registering what parts of the brain are no longer active, this is what they're using to sort of reverse engineered by turning those parts on. That's what enables consciousness. Was this the, well, I think it's probably a simplification of what, what's going, but that's, that's a good, uh, first first step. Yes.
