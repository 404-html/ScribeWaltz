Speaker 1:          00:00          Do you know about the Latin x thing? I didn't know that was the thing. You didn't know about that. What do you mean? I was reading this article and yeah, it's, you know, you know, and Latina are male and female. Gender specific. So the word Latin also get, gets it done as far as, yeah, I dunno. Yeah. So it's supposed to be like, that's how you Latin x that you're supposed to say Latinex because it's just new. It's, it's not. It's a couple of years in the making and fuck off. We'll see in Spanish, the masculinized version of these words just considered gender neutral, but that obviously doesn't work for some of us like myself. And so I think it's appropriate to assign a masculinity as gender neutral when it isn't. So I'm Latinex well, it's interesting because my kids are Latin and this is another one of the things that we touch on to next.

Speaker 1:          00:54          Yeah, there it is. And we touch it. Oh, sorry. Go. No, go ahead please. Well, we touch on this a little, not this pronunciation or, you know, but we touch on that a little bit in the movie of there is that feeling, you know, when, when we went into adopt our kids, we were just open. We were like, look, we're, we're, we're pretty general agewise we, we didn't go in expecting three kids, just, you know, we thought one and it sort of turned into that. But, uh, but you know, you're open to it and you just, and, and they ask you, well, what about ethnicity? You know, and just go, yeah, whatever, you know, wherever the need is, you know, whoever needs parents, you know, let us know. And, but then when, when it happens in your kids, and in my case, my kids turned out to be Latin, then you have the, you know, you start to kind of think about like, oh, well, you know, uh, is that, is that okay?

Speaker 1:          01:46          Is that kind of, you know, is that gonna look like the white savior thing? Is that gonna look weird? Is that I am I, am I saying things right and whatever. And what ends up happening is this really wonderful thing where your family becomes this melting pot where, you know, at first, because of the, there's the, the Times that we live in right now, it is, it's a little scary jumping into that because you're thinking about what you know, but you're, you know, but you ultimately are just going to think about who the kids are, what their need is and how obviously wonderful they are and, but you, but all of those things come up and that's the kind of thing that wouldn't even be, you know, why would that the, the Latinex thing have anything to do with my house. Well now it does.

Speaker 1:          02:28          Yeah. So I've got, I've got all that, you know, all the time and, and uh, I actually find it really interesting. The next thing, no, no, not that specifically, but just that, that my family is now this little melting pot. Yeah, that part's cool. And it's cool. I reject Latinex completely. Well, it is, it is cool. But it's also very strange that that is a, and it would be a real point of concern, like you would worry about, you know, how do I handle this, this culture without cultural appropriation. How do I, how do I bring my kid, embrace the Latino or Latinex culture? Like what do I, how do I handle that? Yeah. Yeah. And how do I do it without getting call the racist? Right. And it gets back to what I was talking about before where you're trying to just put your kids' needs first and just deal with them as children, as individuals, as human beings, you know?

Speaker 1:          03:18          And, but at the same time, you're also, you're, you're with other parents and there's in the adoption community, in really an, in every direction, there's, there's mixed race families and the adoption community and, uh, and you're kind of learning from them. And it just, I dunno, it just, it opens up a lot of conversations with your own kids and, and just the movies you watch, the, the foods you eat sometimes. And I think it's great. No, it's great. I think it's really, you know, the, uh, the language thing for me it stands out more because my whole life I've said Latino, like my mother's Latina and it's just funny to me to speak Spanish speaks fluently, which is hilarious because Tom has some great stories about people not thinking he speaks Spanish because when you look at them and you're like, oh, this fucking American guy.

Speaker 1:          04:02          Yeah. It looks like a regular American guy, but he speaks perfect flu. Like I've been around him before when he asks people questions like, Whoa, I forgot you could do that. Yeah. Yeah. It's like someone who you know, that could do back flips, right. And they just do a back flip. You're like, oh, I forgot you could do that. Yeah, it's true. And that throw it throws people off. Yeah, because you look so American and that, you mean you look like a guy. I mean, if you have a guy loves football stuff, fucking American, irregular American, but he speaks perfect. Enrolls the RS when you go. Even when I travel abroad, like to Spanish speaking countries, even there, even though Spanish speaking countries are also melting pots, you know, they still look at you like, Oh shit, like, you know this mother fucker, it's really throws people want the most.

Speaker 1:          04:49          The craziest one wasn't even with me and my sister who, one of my sisters who also speak Spanish, uh, went to the Naval Academy's Linguistics Center to in the navy and she was in the navy for Awhile and uh, she learned mandarin and it was really intense, you know, was really intense. And we went to a restaurant together and the, the guy who was one of those breasts, like a Benihana tight where they chop stuff up and the guy was a, someone asks like, where he's from and he said somewhere in China and she starts speaking Mandarin and he dropped the thing and he was like, like he saw a ghost and, and she's spitting back to him and pretty fluent Mandarin. Wow. And he stops. And he was like, I've never seen this before. And he's like, I've never seen a white person do this. And we were like, yeah, it's pretty, pretty wild, Huh.

Speaker 1:          05:41          And then he turned to us, he goes, I don't think you understand how hard it is to speak this language. And I was like, I have a pretty good idea, I can't do it. So you know, and then just watching it, he was just like, he couldn't even start cooking your sister to learn. Um, well she was in, when you sign, when you get in to the, like that Naval Institute program, they have you going, I think it was something like eight hours a day, five or six days a week. So it's really, it's super into, it's almost like learning mandarin and it overwhelms people. People drop out almost like in a physical stress way. You know, some people just can't handle it like bootcamp. And I forget how long she was in and you know, she didn't reach the level of, I'm super, you know, fluent like we're speaking English.

Speaker 1:          06:30          But she was able to communicate in Mandarin. Can she read it? She was reading and writing. That's the thing is she was telling me one time about how many characters and you know, it was just unbelievable and like there's sounds for expressions like I'm going to screw up cause I don't remember it. But she was like, you can do something like, oh, and that means like means an actual phrase, you know, like there's so many and that, uh, that there's characters that mean entire expressions as well. That I was like, it's just our brains are so married to our alphabet and way of speaking that gets a real jump to, to learn that, you know, it's just, it really is fascinating when you travel and you listen to people speaking their native tongue and you realize how strangely different languages are across the entire planet. Yeah. I mean, just unbelievable. Like I was in Thailand this summer and you listen to people talk, tie and everything. Ah, everything stretches. It's got like a stretch to it, you know? It's like a weird, Huh? There's W it's just very odd language. I'm like, compare that to like German or Dutch. Yeah. Like the Germans got those hard sounding really hard. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:45          It's like this weird difference. Yeah, and the Latin one, the Latin root word, like languages do have a flowy singy side. They're kind of a nice to listen to. It's a beautiful language. It's really nice to listen to. I mean, I like listening. I don't speak Portuguese. I like listening to it. Yeah. Brazilian Portuguese is amazing. Sounds so cool. And I listen to them. We listen to French music sometimes at home. Just in the kitchen. Yeah. Yeah. Like cooking or something. I don't know what the hell are saying. I like it when I write. I listen to Spanish music when I write because I have no idea what they're saying. I can do that too, where you're listening to music at a foreign language so that it doesn't, it doesn't, it doesn't distract. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It's like, it sounds good. It gives me a little something, something, but I can still think about the exact things that I'm thinking about.

Speaker 1:          08:26          Well, I recently had this interesting experience. I sent you one of them, but you know the trailers for the movie get a, Oh yeah. The movie itself and the trailers get dubbed into all kinds of different languages. So you have this dialogue that, that I wrote, you know, or me John Road or whatever, and you get to hear it in these different languages. And I sent you the Spain. Spanish. Yeah. Yeah. It's different. And I don't really, I'm not gonna pretend that I understand that much. What the difference between between it is, but that's predominantly what you speak, right? No, no, it, no, not mother. What I speak predominantly is just like specifically South American and more specifically or Peruvian dot. Oh, okay. All right, great. So, but I mean, I did study, I studied in Madrid for six months and once your, your ears are trained to it, you can listen to someone say a sentence and know that it's, oh, that's from Spain.

Speaker 1:          09:15          Like that's you. Then there's the Cuban version of it, which is crazy version of the way they, all the island dialects sound dramatically different. You know, like if you listen to somebody from Cuba, Puerto Rico, is it a comparison like English speakers from America versus English speakers from Ireland? [inaudible] it is. Yeah. Um, and I would say, you know, I always think of a Spain as like our Britain, you know, in a way like the, the language properly English is from England. That's where the language, that is how you speak it, Spanish and uh, gas yet Castilian you know, that comes from Spain, they're speaking, Oh gee, Spanish. And then it all kind of came over here and it's influenced in every country has different ways of saying things different. Obviously different slang, um, all different curses, all different expressions. Completely different. Even words like as simple as like to pick up, you know, go ahead, pick something up.

Speaker 1:          10:17          You know, you say that in a Mexico or Argentina, it literally means to fuck. So really? Yeah. So if you're like, you know, cuticle hideous tower, like you're trying to, you're saying I want to fuck this water. Yeah, but just not what they, I'm going to fuck this bottle. Yeah. Yeah. My mom told me that she was in a, in Argentina, like when her youth and traveled there and it was with a bellhop and she was like, go hit made up my letter, which is like pickup that suitcase. But he was like, okay, cause she was basically in slang saying fuck my suitcase, you know? So it's just by like, there's like, there's also like severity of words, like hold aid is the word. Like there's so many ways to say fuck, of course in every language. But holidayed in Spain is like, is saying fuck.

Speaker 1:          11:07          It's like going like, oh fuck. But like when you say it in Peru, no, my wholeness, it's a, it's a softer, it's not taken as severely. So it's not, it's not red the same way. You're not saying, you're saying, uh, like you're complaining, but you're like, I don't, it's like, it's taken as like, oh, don't mess with me. Wow. You know? So like even when I would say when I would go Spain, like they were like, damn, you curse a lot. I was like, really? And then they, you know, we, we went over that one and then like six months later they were like, you actually do curse a lot all the time. And I was like, yeah, that's probably right.
