Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience, you know, the styles of behavior and methods of expression are being criticized and critiqued. It this really radical way and I think it's good. I ultimately, I think there's a lot of batch, I'd say it's good, but the, the, the sentiment is good. You know, I think the reaction and some of the overreaction, like there's a spectrum, right? There's, there's always gonna be like, did you see the, there was something that came out yesterday from Portland State University where Peter Buck goes in and James Damore, the Google memo guy and a Heather hiring. She was a professor at Evergreen state and I remember with the Jordan Peterson gas, and she was actually on my podcast last week with her husband, Bret Weinstein. Weinstein can't stay Weinstein. I'm not thinking of the same person. I was thinking of the person who got fired because of, she did not get, fuck, she ain't get fired, but she criticized her for playing a Jordan Peterson thing.

Speaker 1:          00:57          Is that the same person? No, no, no. That's Lindsey Lindsey something. Yeah, sure. She was in a different university. Okay. Laurie. Yay Canada. And in Canada, another university in Canada, um, this is important. Anyway, so they're in the middle of this conversation and Heather, who is a, she's a biologist and she starts going over the biology of the differences between males and females that are just undeniable. And these kids get up and they started yelling, this is bullshit and fuck you and power to the people, all this crazy shit. And then they tip over the sound system and they're the most hilarious, classical, liberal, progressive lefties, green hair. The guy has like this poofy Afro and he's like, you know, we don't tolerate Nazis, man. Like this is a fucking Nazis or biologist. He's a shit, you know, that's, that stuff is the kind of stuff that I think turns people off to the left.

Speaker 1:          01:57          Yes. And almost provides a gateway to the right where all of a sudden people can buy into and even broader, right wing ideology. Because if you look at the left and that's your perception of the left is it's the people with the pink hair or the blue hair and they're just going around and their whole point is to Ddi platform. People are sensor, people are screaming about Ben Shapiro or whatever the case is. Like my whole thing is put, if you're on the left, and I think most lefties do this to be fair, put the identity politics aside. Okay. And let's talk about the things that we actually already have a majority of the American people with us on. So you know, like a classic leftwing idea. Let's have a living wage. The minimum wage is not a living wage right now and you could work full time and not make enough money to survive.

Speaker 1:          02:39          Well, if you're on the left and you go out there and you talk about we need to fight to try to get a living wage and make our government work for us, well then you get everybody to agree with you. Even most Republicans agree with you and you can go down the list, whether it's legalizing marijuana is 60% of the American people are not with us ending the wars. There was a poll that came out in 2013 so it's old admittedly, but only 17% of the American people still want it to be in the, in the war in Afghanistan. And we're still there today. I'd imagine if anything, that number probably dropped even further and everybody's like, what are we doing in Afghanistan? Right. But it isn't. The problem with polls is when you ask people about it, you're not asking them if they're informed.

Speaker 1:          03:13          You're just asking me. You're just asking their opinion on it. It what I was saying is about the left versus the right is that the real problem is anybody can be on either, so you're going to get these people that are going to disrupt this Heather hiring, you know, lecture on biology from an informed scientific perspective and like fuck, this man is a patriarchy. You're going to get that, but you're also going to get people like yourself. You're also gonna get people that are aware of the issues and educated and are debating this in a very public way and trying to figure out what's the best possible solution to these things. The problem is anytime you have a group, whether it's pick the group gun owners, vegans, what are anybody can fucking join match and as soon as anybody can join, you can't look at like the worst case scenarios.

Speaker 1:          04:02          The green hair dork that kicks over the microphone because they don't like the idea that Heather is speaking logically about biology. Like you know, you have to look at like the the whole thing. Sure. And we don't like to do that. We'd like to point at the green hair dork and say, hey liberals, there's your left share. Exactly. And you know, the breakdown to me is when you look at somebody like that, they're in the category of what I would call authoritarian left because they want to control other people's actions. They want to shut down that speech and say, your ideas are so dangerous. I don't even want to hear it. There's a whole nother contingent of the left, which again I would argue is probably the majority of the left, which is the libertarian left, which is people like me and many others who say, listen live and let live on social issues.

Speaker 1:          04:44          I'm never, even though I don't agree with Steve, Steven Crowder bench Shapiro on anything, I'm never going to, you know, try to protest to get them to not speak their mind at a school is foolish and it makes it look like you don't have an argument when you say, I can't let that guy talk. And then they get to go around and say, I'm so persecuted because I'm right. Right, right. You know, meanwhile I say, okay, you want to have somebody like that go speak to college. Sure. Fine. Let them speak. Let me get the speech after. Well, it's good enough. I mean I think open conversations are critical and I also, uh, I mean this is going to probably be unpopular. I don't think the way to do it is in front of a large group of people. I think you open yourself up to a lot of grandstanding, a lot of sang things just for applause breaks a lot of, there's a lot of bullshit.

Speaker 1:          05:30          It just, it changes the nature of the conversation because it becomes theater. You're doing this thing in front of all these people and you can hear a lot of these times people say things like, I'm a comic. So I know when someone's saying things for reaction, there's a way you do it. Will you say it like this? And that's what we want. And everybody goes, yeah, yeah, you do not. You do not talk like that when it's just you and a person was just you and a person. You are just alone with your ideas. And I think that is the way a guy like Ben Shapiro and you know, put whoever you want on the left should have a discussion.

Speaker 2:          06:03          Yeah. Um,

Speaker 1:          06:06          there's something about that, that soft history, you know, like, so you're not creating the best argument. You're just trying to sound like you have the best argument. And you know, Bill Maher, for example, does this where he's very good at the punchy one liners. Sure. Like he's in a conversation with his panel on his show and he'll be like blah blah blah blah. And there was, that's his style. I mean he's a comic. Say anything, you just can't, it was like a quick partisan hacky point you made. But since people already agree with you in the audience, they clap. So it's hard to flesh out the ideas. And really that's why, listen, I've always said, I'm not the biggest fan of debate because, so I've done a few debates and people online like when I do debates, but I'm not the biggest fan of debates because I think it's like the WWE of intellectual pursuits where you go in this person's whole point is to defend this side of it.

Speaker 1:          06:55          My job is to defend the other side of it and it's like, okay, clash. But it's like, okay, well then when we come across an issue like the fucking 64 genders on Facebook or whatever it is, and I actually might agree and my now put in a position where I'm supposed to be like, no, I'm going to disagree because that's the format of the thing that we're doing. Right. It's just weird and it's not normal. I think that's actually very important for both sides to do. Like when there's something on your side that you disagree with, you should be honest about it. And I even saying that, that there's a side that there's sides that there's our side versus their side. We're, I think we're so inherently tribal that we should resist any temptation whatsoever to form teams, especially about critical issues like it. Really important social issues, really important economic issues, really important. Civil rights issues. These are just things that we should just talk about without looking at them in terms of, oh, the left wants this, so I oppose it or the right ones this. So I have to figure out ways to mock it.

Speaker 2:          07:52          Yeah. Um,

Speaker 1:          07:55          yeah. I don't even know what to say in response to that. I agree. Would you say it's just, you know, it was when we were talking about this before the podcast that like what I try to do is have conversations with everyone. I tried to have conversations with nutty people like Alex Jones. I tried to have conversations with rational people like Sam Harris. I like to, I tried to have conversations with all kinds of people, but without fail, every time I have a left wing person on, I'm some cock left wing. You know what's going to happen anytime I have a right wing person on, um, some outright Nazi apologist. It's like this weird inclination we have to try to label and categorize people and I try to resist those labels as much as humanly possible. Well, I feel like what you're really good at is you can have on people who disagree completely on stuff, but you'll kind of find a nugget of agreement in the conversation with that person and then you can expand on that and you can end up having a very nice conversation and you're not, you never really anybody on to try to like brow beat them and tell them that they're wrong on this issue or that issue.

Speaker 1:          09:00          You know what I mean? So I have no desire to do that. I don't know. I mean, look, I've had, I've had a lot of arguments in my life and I don't like them. I don't think they're beneficial. I mean, I think debate is good, but every time I've ever been in an argument with someone, like a real argument always come out of it feeling gross. Yeah. There are times in life or arguments are necessary. There's times in life where you're just faced with aggression or conflict and you have to do something about it. You have to meet it head on. There are times and likely that, but whenever you can avoid that do, and I think a lot of what arguments are, and I failed at this in my life many times, but a lot of what arguments are, is the way you've reacted to the, the thoughts and the expression that another person has. And if you just reacted a different way or approached in a different manner or took it into consideration a little bit more before you responded, I think the conversation could have gone another way. And I think I'm learning how to do that more and more as they get better at podcasting it better at conversations, learning how to just settle someone down and learning how to genuinely be a nice person. So I don't, I don't want to like insult anybody. I don't want to be in a disagreement with someone. I want to discuss ideas.

Speaker 3:          10:12          Okay.
