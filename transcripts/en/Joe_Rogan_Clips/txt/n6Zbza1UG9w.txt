Speaker 1:          00:00          I know it's a very basic way. I mean we've been talking about good and evil since the time of uh, the men were able and women were able to, you know, write and write and philosophize and though, but I don't know, it just seems to me lately like I've see it feels to me like evil and good is actually a force that we're struggling with. And I know there's, I know like some people would say that's kind of a, you know, a primitive way of thinking, but I do kind of feel like, uh, it actually is a very, a real tangible thing. And that,

Speaker 2:          00:37          what makes you think this look your personal feelings? Is it based on like your intuition? Like what is it

Speaker 1:          00:45          I, yeah, it's intuition. It's like a vibe. It's like a, it's just like a, maybe because I'm showing up at church and kind of like searching a little bit. Myself and I, I am very much about good people doing good things and I'm just been kind of conscious of it. But then there's always like these, this rise of evil, they like comes up like all of a sudden white supremacists are, these riots are these horrible things against people in different parts of the world. And it's, it seems like it's this ongoing struggle

Speaker 2:          01:16          look almost like why hasn't caught up yet to the way you look at the world, the way a lot of people look at the world. Yeah. It's a lot of people look at the world like, like if Tom Papa, if you were in charge and if you had to push all the buttons that would sort of decide how people behaved, that was a possible thing. Of course you'd have one of the first thing you do is eliminate all the violence and all the horrors of the world. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:38          And then also, I'm sorry to cut you off, but you also see the, all those horrors are done by these men and stuff. Who when you sit in like kind of analyze them and they've been the victims of a lot of things and there's like genetic victimization and social and it's like, so where's that coming from? Why are these, this kid that could have been okay ends up in this life of crime and ends up murdering somebody and where's that coming from? Is this just a genetic mutation or is there like a force of good and evil?

Speaker 2:          02:09          I think we're still, we're still dealing with the echoes of the past. That's what I really firmly believe. And I think also the way maybe you and I are having this conversation the way a lot of people are having these conversations today, just like us, like basically the same sort of rational people sitting around with no agenda going, why does this exist? Why, why does all the horrors of life, why, why is all this injustice? Why is that there? I think this is, uh, we haven't been here that long. I just really think that that's real and I think we need to absorb that much better. Or our time spent in modern civilization versus the time of life on earth is a joke. The time on life, on earth and in relationship to the time of the universe is a joke, right? The numbers are insane.

Speaker 2:          02:57          We can't understand that. We, we were monkeys just a couple of weeks ago. Right. Well, the bit that I have my act about the United States being founded in 1776 that's three people ago. Lindsey, behind her, that's three people go really is. Yeah. That's nothing. So three people go, people were these creatures that, uh, had to make fire to stay warm. They didn't have electricity, they didn't have engines. Yeah. They made boats at a trees and they use the wind to drift across the ocean while staring at the stars with a fucking gigantic harp looking thing. Right? What was the thing? A sextant that thing that they use to figure out where the other ones are. So he had a trust that these motherfuckers had mapped out the universe. Well, he could make it across the ocean. And a lot of people died of scurvy along the way.

Speaker 2:          03:48          Like, fuck man, that's crazy. Not long ago. So God damned recently when I was listening to Dan Carlin's hardcore history, one of the best podcasts ever of you, I don't know if you're so good, but he has this thing on the mon goals called the wrath of the cons and what freaked me out is not just how crazy that world was back then and what unbelievable damage and destruction the Mongols created and how they just conquered empires just moved across the world, killed millions and millions of people, but it was really fucked up was I think Google this to make sure I'm not wrong. I think that was only like 1200 BC. I don't think that was that long ago. Right. That's really recent. That's really racist. I think Gingiss Kahn died in the 1200 to five remember correctly? 508 not BC. A d. Oh, did I say BC? I actually met a date.

Speaker 2:          04:45          I said BC, but it really did mean a DJ in the more recent 800 years. I'm a little stone if I'd have made it tomorrow, but that 1200 well 1,260 would still be still be pretty fucking recent, but 1,208 d, which is what I meant to say was so recent. Yes. That's just not that long ago. Yeah, that's the, we're starting to make wine and sour dough, right? Ish. Other way, other way. 92 seven nine two 792 years ago a guy killed 50 million people during his lifetime with his actions. Right. They changed the carbon footprint of the world. I mean they, they oid I mean they, they, so then you're saying it's more right? I was right. You're saying it's more surprising that we're doing this kind of stuff and that we have electric cars and the medicine and all this other kind of like, it's more surprising that we're doing that than it is that people are running around killing each other.

Speaker 2:          05:40          Well, Nazi Germany too. That was 1940s it's crazy. That's maybe crazier than anything. You know, if you and Carla and has some great stuff on that too. And the history of World War One and World War II. But if you're, you're, you're watching a documentary on that and, and you watching those people move around, especially the one that you showed me, Jamie, that's been digitally remastered. When you see it in color, is that Ken? Is it Ken Burns it to that? Yeah, I think so. They digitally remastered some footage from World War One and you get to watch these people move around, look in real time, you realize like, oh these are just people. They're just like you. I know. And this is like a hundred years ago, hundred years ago were involved in this crazy ass war and then a few years later involved another crazy ass war. So why can't we figure it out dude?

Speaker 2:          06:28          He goes, how long he was present? I don't know. I think, I think it used to be the only way that people got by, I think. I think from going from small groups of people, which like in the small groups of people, they would have interpersonal conflicts. They would have fights with members in the tribe, but they would sort it out and there would probably be some sort of rule that they would all try to live by. But then they would get invaded by people that didn't have anything. And then when looking for your stuff and they came over the top of the hill and they killed and they raped and they, they stole women and they just did that for a long ass time. Man. They did that for a long ass time. This was the history of the steps like that. Dan Carlin maps out in this wrath of Khan thing makes you go, Jesus, Chris, imagine being born then Nanchang just imagine how crazy that me being a baby at seeing arrows flying around and if people could open to people were lighting people on fire and launching them onto roofs with catapults, right?

Speaker 2:          07:32          This is the footage for World War One. So look how they digitally remastered it and

Speaker 1:          07:36          yeah, Peter Jackson is taking a movie, I believe, or a documentary. That's the craziest thing. When you look at history and you think, well that was then it's like no, they're just us. Just happened to be there. Really no different than you and

Speaker 2:          07:47          dude, we haven't been here this long. We haven't been here this long. This is the thing like people that looked like this, that awaring like uniforms and that are you know, have like decent stuff, nice wheels to their wagons, all that kind of shit. That's real recent man.

Speaker 1:          08:05          No, I know it's reached in his fuck and there's been a bunch of different ways that people have done it, you know? But even if he go back to like the Egyptians but isn't it the act of like, okay so we know like that guy let his house on fire. Yeah, we know that is a just instinctually we know and have known during even all of us this history, we've known that that is evil like right. You know what I mean? Like it's insanely selfish. It's not like we went from having to like eat each other and that we're trying to get our act together. You know what I mean? There is a, we all know that that is such a evil, evil thing. I think it exists. I think we have to fight it.

Speaker 2:          08:45          It is evil, but it's ego that's causing that. Right? That guy didn't want to go to jail. It didn't want to shoot himself, didn't want to kill himself and didn't want to go to jail. So he decided he was going to kill a bunch of people to make up a story. He had a plot in his plows to save himself. All right. You know, and that's when people get trapped in a situation where they're allowed to make decisions and they're allowed to, you know, if not allowed to. But if they choose to make decisions and those decisions are horrific and then they have to somehow or another justify those decisions cause they never look at their own behavior. They always judge other people. And this is a pattern that people fall into, whether it was looking for other people to always be wrong, right? And they never grow.

Speaker 2:          09:27          And so like a guy like that, if he was so psychotic that he could kill somebody. And then he has this decision to make. This decision is to kill the wife and the kids still the keys just like always gotta be right. You know what I'm saying? Like he's always, he's got an e, he's trying to cover his tracks, he's trying to lie always like this is the type of person that could do something like that horrific pattern or thought and it might have been triggered by the murder itself. So it's just a chemical flipping his brain that says, now I can kill people. Like he hasn't done it his whole life and he's just going into the subway and getting a sandwich with all the stuff on it and just be like watching the Monday night football. And then the next week he's like, something flips in his brain is like, no, now I can kill.

Speaker 2:          10:09          I don't think it's a little painful that I know and love. I think in a fit of rage, in a fit of rage, he does something horrific. And then I think he's one of those people that tries to justify his actions. So it just totally tries to figure out a way where he can justify it, that they're, they're going to be in hell anyway cause the guy's dead. You know, they'd, they'd probably deep he could. You think we're crazy man. They come up with justification. We came from the side, like we said before, this is an Italian dude like us. Right? But he could've also, we don't know if he's medicated. Do we know that it's a big warning in chemistry. We don't know what he was doing. You know what I mean? He could have been on something which, uh, you know, makes people do horrific things.

Speaker 2:          10:56          Do you think, do you believe in Karma? I think for sure that when you put energy out there, it affects things around you in terms of the way people interact with you. And that in turn affects the way they will interact with other people as well. And I think there's like, there's, there's a certain amount, there's an energy you put out, you could call it that, but that makes it sound like you got a crystal in your pocket, right? Not really. Energy is real. It's like energy is a real thing. There is a real right. If I was, if I was a murderer and came and sat in here, there'd be a different vibe than what you're feeling from me. Yeah, for sure. You know what I mean? For sure. Yeah. A chronic masturbator well, it's also people that are off and then struggling with the fact that they've done something awful. Right. There's like an energy to that. It's like a constantly being on edge energy every and punishment.

Speaker 1:          11:54          That's still CFC. Yeah. I never read that. Oh, you should read it. It's so he kills someone and this is the east caring. It's the Gill greatest description of the guilt. Just carrying that thing. Now that guy's going to admit an energy, but you don't think there's Karma just for like you'd do something bad and then so something bad will happen.

Speaker 2:          12:12          I think a genuinely believe, and this is no crystals in my pocket, I genuinely believed that if you do something that you know to be awful, that that has an equal effect coming back at you. Like whatever bad that you've put out in terms of like doing something evil to a person, the way you feel personally about yourself, you will take an equal blow. I really believe that. And where does that blow come from? I think comes from your own introspective thinking. I think maybe even worse. You know, you might even feel worse than that. Like you could say something rude to a person just because you're tired and then you realize you said something rude, annoying. All right, why did I do that? I didn't mean. And then they can be like Tom, Papa's right now. I'm not really not. I just, I'm so tired, you know, and you just ask me something stupid. I'm sorry. But it's like, it's hard to turn that around, you know? So you might hate yourself more than they even get mad at you.

Speaker 1:          13:12          So Karma is really you dealing with the energy. It's not the universe saying now something bad's going to happen to you. You're kind of creating it with your own actions and your own stuff.

Speaker 2:          13:22          I think it's real dangerous when we pretend that we have any sort of real understanding of the patterns of all the events that take place in the world. So when you start to say like someone, something happened to someone because of Karma, that's okay. The problem was saying that is what about babies? What about babies with leukemia? Where they bad babies? What happened? Why did they get cancer? Why did they die young? Why did they die in car accidents? Why the day? That doesn't make any sense. They didn't never done anything bad there.

Speaker 1:          13:54          But that's where you could say that, uh, you know, bad shit happens to us all, but can you create more bad ship? You find your balance possible

Speaker 2:          14:02          co two. And it's, it's also entirely possible that you're creating more bad shit but feeling bad about yourself because you've done bad shit. So you create more of this negative energy that you carry around with you. I think that's entirely possible too. But I think that we also have this weird need to define things, you know, and that I think that we're, we're looking to this thing that we're calling Karma and we're saying that this is like this, this definite correlation between action and reaction and between the good you put out there and the good that comes back. And my take is that I think there's definitely something going on, but I don't think we should define it yet cause I don't think we really know. And I think as soon as we box it up and, and say it's this thing and this is the, the absolute reaction that the world has when you put good out there, good comes back. Good people die all the time, folks. Good people die.

Speaker 1:          14:54          I think we're, I think that there's, I think there is an energy and the, you know, we know it from the work that we do. I think it's both. When you stand on stage, there's an energy in that room, that transference between you and the people that are out there and you're playing with it and it's a real thing. It's a very real thing. It's like hypnosis, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is. And, and then they can, they can reverse hip hypnotize you. They can bring this other energy the other way so that there is this energy of all of us out there and running around. It's, it's not that far to think then there couldn't be good energy and there's bad energy and theirs. And is that ultimately good and evil? Maybe it is all generated from human beings. Maybe if you educated everyone and they could all be kind and try and come at it that way, we could actually feel that there was more good. But that's just more good coming from people. I don't know. Well,

Speaker 2:          15:47          if you want to get really spacey with this, Surely Really Spacey, it's the holidays you go, okay, well what, what exactly are people doing? That's what you do. You, what are people doing? What are they doing? Like what, what's our purpose to be being here? Look at us from an outside perspective. Like pretend you're not a person, right? You're looking at all the people like what are they doing? They're moving really fast. They're spending most of their time doing things they don't want to do and they're buying stuff bustling around. So because they're throwing all this money at stuff, the stuff keeps getting better. So every year this stuff keeps getting more complex and more capable and more high tech and more space age. This is bananas, man. I've got to watch, I can call it people like fucking Dick Tracy man, right? Yeah. And that as people keep going on and on and on and on with this stuff.

Speaker 2:          16:35          This is, we need some sort of energy behind this innovation and a lot of the energies, conflict, conflict and resolution, conflict and resolution, conflict and victory, victory and defeat. And if it defeat makes you work harder. And there's all these interacting forces that are constantly moving together. I'm with you, ended this, a lot of it is expressed. The success of this little game has expressed in material possessions. The success in this game is expressed in Hamptons mansions and private jets and Bentleys and Pam, I'm winning this fucking crazy game off stuff and there's a lot of value and winning the crazy game. Who Stopped? So we let these people acquire all this stuff and you've got all these diamonds and fuck, yeah, this is, this is forcing more stuff to be made better and more innovation, which will eventually, and this is where it gets space just of all waiting for this part.

Speaker 2:          17:35          This is going to be what people become. People are going to become some sort of symbiotic organism, but something that's tied into electronics and that this, it's happening now. It's happening slowly and we're making it with stuff and as we keep making, it's eventually gonna get to a part that was the thing you would like to do more than anything is having to enhance your experience on earth. Right. I want to be able to take pictures. Yes, yes. I want to be able to email people. Yes, yes. Yeah. But I also want to, I want it to make my experience on earth better. Well then we're going to have to integrate with your circuitry, Tom, papa, and then live forever. Maybe. Maybe that's what the organisms are trying to do. They're trying to get rid of the monkey that wants to start the wars all the time.

Speaker 2:          18:18          Right. It's enlightenment. That urge that none of our goofy ass system evil. What if only some that would be a great science fiction movie with this is the future and they probably were already made it. But if only some people went on board with the new enlightenment that you'd get from these like headsets. Like remember the dude from Star Trek, the blind guy from sesame street. Remember he was, he used to be on sesame street, right? Yeah. The, he was the uh, the vibrating Rainbow Lavar yeah. Reading Lavar Burton. Barbara, yeah. Yeah. If we all had those things on, there was only like 10 of them flooded. Know No, like falling into those people bought into it and those things completely cure you of a, of any evil. It just moving along. I think that, uh, I don't know. I mean there is, maybe there is no purpose to us being here, but it is. So you got that shit for pep boys, that's a filter. That's a really cool air filter at the top of the muscle car, isn't it? Yeah.
