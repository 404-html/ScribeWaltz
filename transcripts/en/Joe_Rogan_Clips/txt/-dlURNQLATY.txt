Speaker 1:          00:00          And he had a lot of groupies and he took and you know he, he forgot they were filming was Mike and he had a lot of group laid the law down. Jump on him. That's hilarious. I need to see that. I was telling you about uh, American made the movie with Tom Cruise and other bad ass Tom cruise movie. Oh yeah, we see he's on the airplanes. You was just jumping around. Yeah, do it. It's good. It's really good. It's a good movie. They look, I know a lot of the Barry seal story and they covered a lot of, you can only cover so much of it and a 90 minute movie. But yeah, look, I mean they did not pull any punches. They made look like Bill Clinton got 'em off. Bill Clinton called the prosecutor. They caught him with millions of dollars of and cocaine and money phone call.

Speaker 1:          00:43          Nope. Nope. They have her on the phone with Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton, who like, he's telling her I'm going to walk. Whether or not he said that, I don't know cause he's dead. No one knows. Right. And he's telling her it was, trust me, I'm going to walk right out of here. And they're all laughing and she's like, you're not going to walk anyway. And they're like, Mrs Prosecutor, Bill Clinton's on the phone, and it's governor Clinton. Yes. Yeah. And you see your group, you see, just get pissed off. The next thing you know, they're unconfident and he's leaving. So they would let you know that Bill Clinton, if they, if the only way you could put that in the movie is there has to be truth, right? Some truth to him, they're like, there's gotta be some sort of a documented record of him making that call. Right. He made that call.

Speaker 1:          01:25          He had to have made that call. You couldn't defamation, of course, Clinton. And he is the governor. So there's probably a record of him saying, let that guy go. And so the reason they think is because in the film, this is what they're saying is that he was tied in with the CIA and somehow or another through the CIA using him for reconnaissance photos and stuff like that. And the eventually got hooked up. These drug dealers and started selling drugs. The CIA was in on it and they were allowing him to do it and he was getting them photographs and Intel from all these different drug places. And in return they were letting him do whatever he did and taking a piece of it problems, which you mentioned Mena Arkansas. Yeah, yeah. They mentioned all the, all the, I mean that's where Bill Clinton was the governor of the only found out about all this stuff because two kids were killed.

Speaker 1:          02:10          They were murdered. And they told the parents that the kids had gotten high and fell asleep on the train tracks. But the parents did an independent autopsy and found stab wounds in the kits. So like, oh Jesus, what the fuck happened here? And then slowly but surely the whole thing unravels. They witnessed a drug drop. Yeah. And uh, well they couldn't have any witnesses. They made mean like it was lit case he killed, go to youtube and just punch in a CIA, Mena, Arkansas, cocaine blow. And you get the host. It's a sear. It's like, it could be at two kids. We don't know. We don't know. Somebody who was in our assume the CIS. The kids must have seen the drugs be dropped and whoever was selling the drugs, moving the drugs, they just decided to kill these kids cause they couldn't take a chance.

Speaker 1:          02:57          The kids keeping their mouth shut so they killed them. And apparently that was just one thing though in the movie, the way they haven't made up is like that. That was just one thing that's sort of straw that broke the camel's back. They don't even have that. And I don't even remember if they had that in the movie. The kids, did they have that in the movie? The murder? They didn't have the murder, the kids. No they didn't. But what they did have is these people were, I mean everybody was rich. There were all coming in and buying things and everyone's like, where the fuck is all this money coming from? Who is rich? The people that we're working with, Barry seal's like his brother in law, like his wife's brother apparently. I don't know if that was a real person, but in the, in the movie, he's, he's balling out of control and he's, uh, he's got some fucking ridiculous souped up car and he's got money coming out of his pockets and he stuffed in his pocket and he gets caught by a cop. You know, and I don't know if that happened in real life, but in the movie they made it seem like everybody was just, there was so much money flowing around. It didn't make any sense. They were burying it in his backyard. They, when they busted him, it was like in the movie. Now again, I don't know if this was real.
