Speaker 1:          00:00          How did you guys feel when I was going through all of that? Like what was the effect on you guys? I was very nervous. Yeah. I was very nervous about you. Um, cause I don't, um, I didn't know what to do and I knew I could do, I knew I could help you financially. I knew I could do that. So I did that immediately, but I didn't know what to do. I don't, I didn't, didn't know what it feels like and I didn't know what would it be the path to take. But when you offered that you were having problems with your psychiatrist and the medication and I said, okay, well let me, let me get ahold of Matt, who I know will know the right people. I see people don't tell me anything. Yeah. You were like, oh, I was like, you were, you're such a non complainer that I knew when I always tell people this story, but we're playing pool and Ari's limping around the table.

Speaker 1:          00:52          I'm like, what the fuck happened to your leg man? Fucking spider bite or something. I go, what? Let me see your fucking leg. And he pulls his pants up like a dude, you got to go to the hospital right now. You have a very bad staph infection in this could fucking kill you. And you're like, come on, you're joking. I'm like, I start unscrewing my cue. I'm like, we're going to the hospital now. It was so bad. But the fact that you're so stoic, you will, you never complained once while you have this gigantic plus fields on your knee killed. It was horrible, man. One posted the juke clay and video and they were, he was like, do you know that there? And he's like, ah, it's bogging you. Not me. What?

Speaker 1:          01:32          So when you were, when you were telling me that you were doing bad and it wasn't, you weren't feeling good and you were, you were telling me you were suicidal. I was like, okay, stop. We got to now this is, we're going to figure this out. You know, I don't know what to do. We're going to figure this out. Maybe nervous. Cause I was nervous that I wasn't going to be there when you needed me to be there. And you know, and I would just, I would just get the call. It's just get the call. Yeah. I mean as a friend that's the last thing you want to do is have some situation when you feel like maybe you could have called them and you could have made them feel better and you, they would've just gotten over that hump and then they would have been okay.

Speaker 1:          02:12          Like you became okay man. I mean, you were my most depressed friend and now you probably one of my happiest friends, even after I started seeing that guy, it's still took months before finding the right pill and the right dosage and then he would talk to me every like 30 days or whatever it was you, I remember you describing the process and one of the things that was disconcerting to me was how random it seemed to be. What do you mean? Which pills they chose? It's like they're guessing. That's what seemed insane to me. I felt like if you like, say you know you got an infection, they know which antibiotic works best on that infection, boom, they give it to you. But this one wasn't that cut and dry. It was, they were just trying stuff out on you. Yeah. It's like, oh, you need Ibuprofen.

Speaker 1:          02:53          You have an inflamed thing. It'll took it down. But they know generally. Yeah. This is like there's, from what I get gather, those two things could be wrong with you. You either have too much dopamine, too little dopamine, too much something else, or too little something else. Huh. And so each of these pills, I think they're into two categories or four categories, and they either, they either affect the dopamine or they effect the other thing, either limited or push more in and then the other, so they don't know which one's doing it to first. Uh, and then once they narrow that down, they've got to decide if it's like getting too much of it or too little. I don't know if you're bipolar is a separate thing. They're just guessing. And then while you take this shit, you've added the horrible feelings and then added some awful side effect. You're just like, ah. This is one of the things that I really wanted to point out when when Bruce Roseanne was going to come on, I wanted to really talk about medication and how we're, we're asking this really, you know, she's an elderly woman who's taking an incredible amount of medication. She takes.
