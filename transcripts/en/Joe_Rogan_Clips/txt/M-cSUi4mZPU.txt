Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello Freak bitches because you're, we're going way, way, way back. The, the real issue. This is like a year before, more than a year before everything went sideways. Oh yeah. What went sideways and why? So you're this Super Progressive Vegan guy, but what went sideways? So I'm an ex of mine. I'm an ex of mine. Uh, I'm trying to think about like how much I can say, um, started. Um, it was weird, like girls I was dating, like she would kind of like pop up and be like, following them on like social media. And I kind of was like, all right, it's a little weird. Um, girls, you were dating, but you were married at the time. So what was also not talked about in these articles is that for the last however many years before, um, Alison, I got separated. We were in an open relationship. We just didn't, we talked about it on the show eventually, but for a while we didn't talk about it.

Speaker 1:          00:58          Um, and which to anyone in a fucking open relationship, like it's a nightmare when you're not talking about it because you feel like a, a lecherous cheating creep, uh, cause you're in an open relationship and you don't talk about it. So then when girls meet you and you tell them like, yeah, right, yeah, totally. When you go, I'm in a secret open relationship, like you're full of shit. Um, and so, you know, I like kind of did the road of thing, but like felt like a fucking creep and three meaning hookup with girls. Yeah. And, uh, and then, uh, uh, you know, I was finally just like, we have to talk about it and at this point, and I don't want to shit on anybody, uh, you know, at this point, um, you know, my cohost and I, we were like, we were pretty much just like really good friends, right.

Speaker 1:          01:45          Who lived together and did a show together. And, um, so years later, years after, um, me and this girl broke up years after all this shit, I'm living in La. Um, I have, uh, I've had a girlfriend for a year. It's like a very healthy, wonderful relationship. Um, years after all this, I guess what happened was one of these girls, um, essentially started to try to find any girl who has been pissed off by me before and they found enough for an article that, um, I think like two articles came out. I left to do some radio because the show was getting a ton of complaints. Um, because our inner circle started to find out that there were quote unquote accusations, which the word accusation makes it sound Weinstein. Um, accusations of, so that's what they were saying. But there was, it was very unspecific. What I've read, they said predatory behavior and I was like, oh, meaning he's trying to get laid.

Speaker 1:          02:44          That's what a man does. Not Predatory in the sense of you're victimizing someone to raping someone or doing something horrible to someone or even, and this is when my own words kind of bit me in the ass because you, I spent an entire year a or years being like, you know, a Hashtag believe women. And then you read that and you go to that Hashtag. Don't believe when it like you don't know what to do. And like I, I was always like, if you call girl who accuses you, uh, uh, you know crazy. You're just projecting and like you're trying to, and then suddenly I'm reading this article, I'm like, this is fucking crazy. And I didn't, uh, all of my style on one article you talking about the, there's a decibel. Yeah, there was a decibel article and Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned man. I, uh, it was really bad and I read it for the first time and I don't want to go into details because I don't want to shit on people who like, feel like they were, um, you know, hurt or whatever. Um, but a good majority, the article isn't even fucking true. Um, there was one part where Jazz Abella even wrote it. Like if we can make it better

Speaker 2:          03:45          journalism because it's one woman who wrote it.

Speaker 1:          03:48          Oh, Yay. Oh yeah, totally. So this, so the author, there's one moment in it, and I'll try and make this a about journalism and not about the, the woman, but one of the complaints about me was I had a consensual night, um, with a lady in Nashville, um, who I guess because she like listened to the show. Maybe they're like, that's predatory because you're like famous. And I was like, mom, no one else thinks I'm fucking famous. Uh,

Speaker 2:          04:14          well, wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait a minute. There were defining as predatory because you're famous. That's part of it. Every time Mick Jagger gets laid, it's predatory.

Speaker 1:          04:23          That's part of it. That's what I don't, that's the thing. And it was the way I don't fucking call me. If I'm Mick Jagger famous, you can call me a fucking predator. If I'm, I can barely get a plus one to a Vegan festival. Famous like, don't please

Speaker 2:          04:35          do not call me a predator. I mean, look, it's, there's levels to fame, right? And I know you're being self deprecating and everything like that, but you did have a nice following and you did, I saw some of your videos online where you did big crowds. So it's not, no, it's not like you didn't have fans give that fence but, but the idea that you liking some woman who is a fan and her liking you like that somehow under the Europe Predator because she enjoys your work is crazy. What is that how they were defining it? Because I don't know. And then, but then it seems like they're being very convenient, their definition

Speaker 1:          05:11          and, and, and that was part of it. There was like, uh, uh, um, there was another one where it was like, yeah, the predatory stuff's specifically was that, and then what was even more fucked up about the article was it said, um, and I'm not going to quote exactly. She also wrote into another podcast and I heard this, but essentially what the woman said, we did not sleep together. It alluded that we slept together. It didn't say that I was in an open relationship, but we didn't sleep together. Um, she told me she didn't want to, uh, uh, sleep together and I was like, great, no problem. She's like, I don't want to, I don't want it to go further than that, you know? Okay. So I was like, cool, even if you change your mind, we're not going to do it. Got It. And then in the article, in the article about me being a Predator, it's like I felt so safe and, and it was a great night and I was like, this sounds like an article about BP in a good dude.

Speaker 1:          06:01          And then it said, but then weeks later she heard on the podcast that uh, she was just a quote road fuck. And then Jessebelle in parentheses is one Arthur from Jess about and fantasy said, Jessebelle could not find the clip. Right. Cause it doesn't fucking exist because I'm not going to call someone a road fuck next to my wife on my feminist podcast. Not only that, you're not going to say it if you didn't even have sex with them. We didn't have sex. Right. So this is just, they just decided to take this characterization by this one woman that's it and flavor the article. Yes and very unfair. No and dude like is this punishment you think for you because you somehow or another. So that's why it becomes easy and and just to be like incredibly clear. Like if this woman was like hurt by that, like that sucks man.

Speaker 1:          06:47          I've been burned by girls do anything. If she didn't, if she was hurt because you didn't eventually become her girlfriend, her boyfriend rather. That's just on her. Sure. Unless you're ms character. No, no, no, no. It's Catherine just trying to be, you're trying to be nice to be nice. Yeah. I assume she is probably, you know, I mean she's probably taken out of context as well. There's a real problem with writing things about people and one of the real problems with writing things about people is they don't get a chance to respond in real time to things you're saying. So you establish a narrative and then you keep going with it. You write paragraph after paragraph with no s no one responding to them. A month later, I, I saw like the, the, the woman who wrote the article, like there was a request in my like, other inbox and Facebook that like, you don't even see and like for a comment.

Speaker 1:          07:35          So like, I mean, she did reach out. Um, but at that point I was, uh, at that point I was literally googling ways to kill myself. So I'm like, I did, I could not get back to googling ways to kill yourself for real. Yeah. For Real. So, well just to like why put against this on the article. So here's what happened, and this goes to your, your question before, because I had called so many people sexist because I had sort of made my almost career by that. Um, it was a fucking fun man when people heard about this, like, and you see the headlines and this is another like problem with like clickbait journalism. The headlines look like I was fucking accused of rape. There was a one article that used the word sexual harassment. Sexual misconduct was in all the headlines that I have no fucking idea.

Speaker 1:          08:22          So seen that one about people connected to Harvey Weinstein, like about Ben Affleck, they call it sexual misconduct. What does that mean? Like in something that you don't think they should do? What's really creepy? Eagle and I almost lost a job. I did just lose a gig because when you Google and B, it's like sexual misconduct stuff. And like that's really scary. And again, I don't want to be like, you know who the real victim of Harvey Weinstein is? Jamie Kilstein. Right. But like, uh, let me just stop you right here. If you say like one more time, I fucking head's gonna explode too. And I get comments like that. It's brutal. It's a

Speaker 2:          08:55          brutal, is it as bad as I just want you to slow it down. I'm gonna use it every now and then. This coffee over here, breaking the light. The light meter. I'm gonna do it too, man. A lot of people do it. It's an easy one to do, switch to water, but that word is a, it's an, um, it's, uh, people use it as, um, I know, I know. It's okay. I do it too. We all do it, but it's just, it's nice to know. Yeah, no, I, it's also a very progressive thing. Like there's a way like that people talk, like when they're really progressive that like you don't hear like leftwing people talk. I keep getting fucked over by the progressive's. It's a way of a peering. Um, what's the word? Submissive or passive? Yeah. It's not a, it's not an aggressive way of communicating. All right. What if I said like, but like I kept like punching the table, like as I did it on a fucking, like much, you know, like go to like step to me just smash a paps. Uh, can. Um, so, so you got a bunch of people that were upset at you because you had embodied

Speaker 1:          10:03          the quintessential allies. So it was there. Nobody had a reason to like me or to defend me. On one half of the Twitter sphere you had progressive's who thought I was a sexual creep. And then on the other half you have comedy fans who are like, fuck this dude. He's the one who called everyone a sexist. You don't need to read the article. If you see a headline, I mean, God, I attacked so many people without fucking reading the articles. Of course there are people to this day that will come up on citizen radio that I don't know why I was mad at, I would just figure out the story as we were covering it and be like, Yup, fuck that guy. I guess. Yeah, of course. And so nobody, there was no reason to root for me. There wasn't a strong enough fan base. It wasn't like if, you know, a, a bigger comic gets accused of something.

Speaker 1:          10:52          Well he has thousands or millions of fans and then this small community who are accused him of something I had sort of nobody, and when I burnt all the bridges and in comedy and you know, I never just showed up at clubs to do sets and stuff like that. I just had this audience and sort of thought I could never get fired, you know? Um, like when, when Allie and I sort of became more platonic before the open relationship. I mean, there were days it was, it was so, uh, you know, I mean I would sleep on the couch but there were days I would go on the road and I would not cheat and I would go back to the hotel and sure cough and like my orgasm was better cause I'm like, I saved citizen radio. Like I was trying so hard not to, not to do anything like that. And so anyway, I lost. Yeah, there was no one to root for me. I just had the small audience. It's a small audience. Either thinks I'm a Predator or they're too nervous to say anything. Well

Speaker 2:          11:44          you fit the Quintess you, you, there's a classic view of what a male feminist is and that classic view is a sneaky guy

Speaker 1:          11:54          that is like getting in tight with women and saying all the things they really want to hear. And the classic story is that those women are never attracted to that guy anyway. And one up and go and fuck some jocks, some Alpha Guy. I mean that's literally what happens. Yeah. You don't say like do you, but it's just this thing that people, there's, it's just, well, it's a cliche and I totally, and I also think it was the homophobic politician who sucks the deck right there. Like the Super Religious Guy who, uh, turns out to actually be gay. Like Ted, what does that kind of thing to the guy from Colorado? Can we just say careers and start a bar? You probably could take rice. Uh, yeah. And so it haggard Ted Haggard. Yes. And to try to have a bit about them and who didn't we have, right.

Speaker 1:          12:45          And so this is what happens. Yeah. This is sort of the, the problem with acting like you don't have flaws. And I always did. I thought on the show, my favorite parts of my show were when I talked about depression or alcoholism and, and we were getting emails in from people who, you know, it's edited, really helped them. And I wanted to talk so much more about that stuff because I, I do think it's important to examine your flaws, but on a political level, I held myself up. It's like an untouchable, well, I think you were doing essentially the same thing that you were talking about doing on Twitter where you're addicted to this positive response and you're addicted to saying these things about people attacking people there. There's, this is a, it's a real problem on the left.
