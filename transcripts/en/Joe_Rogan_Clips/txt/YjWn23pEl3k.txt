Speaker 1:          00:00          Religion in many ways gives you answers right now. Yeah. Without the, to sort of to the research it or to go on the frontier. The lack of education and the lack of a lack of curiosity about it. It's one of the scariest things about new generations of kids, right? Like when the new generations are coming up, if they know less than the generation before, that's when we really start to freak out. That would be a problem. Although I have good confidence in the 30 and under gender. Does that millennial, I will be have to be, I think millennials have only ever known the Internet and devices. So what would you say recent, but my son is a millennial and he's like, my kids are millennials so they're twentyish so 30 is a little old. So 25 and under I think are the millennials. Yeah. But 30 when they were 10 the Internet was around.

Speaker 1:          00:48          I know, but they need a different marketing terms so you can market to them differently. Yeah. So to me, I would put them in the same bin just as you were thinking there. But, but they, they have a different relationship to science and technology. Of course they're not, they don't fear the science or the technology. They embrace it because it has shaped the civilization that is enabled their social life. It has. But through this, like one of the things that I tweeted, I think it was from scientific American yesterday, maybe it was yesterday, that, uh, it's a little bit misleading, but one of the things they said is only 64% of millennials have a strong belief. These things, these coasters are terrible. They look great. But then things stick to the bottles are made of a metal, a metal coaster. Yeah. See what the hell is that sticks?

Speaker 1:          01:35          Yeah. That's the issue sticks when it gets moisture, you know about this. We flip this over and he tip it over and then it, what happens on that? They never did that. What? Datastay yeah. Oh, because of the pressure. The air pressure on it. Okay. But don't do it. I don't trust your science. Your objective truth. 64% of what of millennials are not, uh, are only 64% are convinced that the world is a ball. The world is a circle that [inaudible] us. What is it a spheroid? Is that what it's called? Oblique. I'd like to see how that question exactly. Because if they know that we are ablate and the thing is asking, is Earth a ball? They'll say, no, we're an ablate ball or a slightly wider below the equator than, uh, than at the equator. So we're a pear shaped oblate spheroid but it's not a pair that you would find normally if you found that period.

Speaker 1:          02:30          But like this is fucking pair that's shaped like a ball. So the, these distinctions, these differences in measurements are so small that if you found it on the ground, you would say, this is a perfect sphere. Right? Let me tell you how, how good a sphere it is. Right. All right. Do you ever see the, the school room Globes, the Geographic Globes, and you rub your finger over in Nepal and you get the th the Himalaya? Yeah. Yeah. And you get the Rockies. He said, Ooh, that is a gross exaggeration of reality. Yes. Do you realize if you took earth with all of its mountains, valleys, and hills and rep and shrunk it down to the size of a cue ball, he'll be smoother than any cue ball. Every machine?

Speaker 2:          03:09          Yes. Yes.

Speaker 1:          03:12          Think about it. Why? I think, think about this Joe. Really. Joe Rys, go chill. Listen to me. You Ready? Okay. Uh, do you know the deepest part of Earth's crust? No. The Marianas trench off the coast of the Philippines in the Pacific Ocean. That's the deepest, deepest white it six miles down. Okay. Oh, okay. So, okay. Sorry. No, no. Just access to the deepest part of Earth's crust. The lowest point on her surface. The Marianas trench right off the coast of the Philippines. The highest point on earth surface. The tip of a k one k two k one or k two which one is Japan? I think it's k one. Why would you name the tallest peak? K Two it's good to point. I'm just right. I'm not a mountain climber, but I'm, I'm just thinking k one k with the, it's the Himalayan mountains in Nepal. Okay. Isn't it in Nepal? I'm thinking it is. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so now let's say how high up is that? It was 28,000 feet, so it's like five miles up.

Speaker 2:          04:18          Okay. Right. The distance

Speaker 1:          04:22          between the lowest point on earth surface and the highest point on earth surface is 11 miles. That's here to the comedy store. That is less than the length of Manhattan. Whoa. Yet we are 8,000 miles in diameter

Speaker 1:          04:40          and those two points are very far separated from one another. If you are cosmetic giant and you came up to earth and you rubbed your finger over earth's surface, it would feel as smooth as a cue ball to you. Wow. In fact, in this, in this book, I have a whole chapter called on being round, which is all about, this is all about our perception of what is round and what is not. I had asked you to debate one of them flat earth guys. No, I don't. I can't. I know, I know. We talked about it and we're going to have him on Skype, not what we do is, and I think this is a diabolical plot so that the next time we can ship people on mass into orbit, they all want to be the first in line because they know we're going to send them.

Speaker 1:          05:23          So if they can see the round earth, they're going to be the first ones in space just so they can stop annoying the rest of them. I don't think you're correct. I don't think you're correct, but everything is a diabolical plot. I do have people that have met that don't believe because they, the problem with youtube videos is that it's a problem with a lot of things, but one of the things about being unchecked, why you are discussing things is you can say things, you can use big words, you can sound articulate and smooth and you can do it in a very professional looking manner or do it passionately. Yes, passionately, convincingly charismatically and you, you're unchecked. But if you did that in front of an expert and you showed them that along the way, they go stop. That's not true. Stop this. Not what works.

Speaker 1:          06:11          Right? Let me show you why this is incorrect. Let me show you how you could prove that this is incorrect. Objective truths, but this is not happening. Render your argument invalid so people don't have any education and then they watch one of these youtube clips. They start actually believing that this stuff makes sense because it's unchecked. And I would say it's not about whether they've had education, it's about whether the education they had teaches them skepticism of information and teaching them how to inquire. You realize it's just as intellectually lazy to believe everything you see as it is to deny everything you see. Yes. Why should someone know automatically that earth isn't flat yet? I tell them in the next breath that the entire universe was once a small as a marble, right? Both of those sound equally preposterous except one has evidence to back it and the other does not.

Speaker 1:          07:06          And very strong scientific theoretical and experimental underpinnings. So when you are trained to inquire, you don't either believe everything outright or reject everything out, right? You're trained to ask questions. You trained to probe deeper than the layer of information that comes to you. That's what should be taught in school. And it's not, they give you a book and say, learn this and you'll get tested on it. And then when you're done, learn this well is it also there's a problem with being inexorably connected to your first belief to when you have an idea and it's in your head, it's very difficult for people to shake that idea and they start arguing that idea, that idea becomes a part of their identity and they dig their heels in deeper when an opposing view is presented to connect themselves to these ideas, right? It's, it is who they are.

Speaker 1:          07:58          Right? Right. And so I, I try not to base my character profile on something that is not yet verified as objective truth. And this is a very good thing to do. It's one of the reasons why I don't have tattoos on my body. Oh, holdings go. It's stretching my face. Go on. Uh, one of the reasons is there's nothing I am so sure about that. I want to put it in Delhi on my skin with, no, no, that's not, let me say it differently. There's nothing I value in my mind, body, and soul so much in this moment that I want to indelibly etched it on my skin cause I want to leave room for me to have a possibly more enlightening thought later.
