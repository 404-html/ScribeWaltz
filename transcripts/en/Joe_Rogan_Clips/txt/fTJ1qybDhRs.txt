Speaker 1:          00:00          Got to tell him, man. I mean, if you watch his fight with Glover to sharer are you watch his fight with the Little Nog? Yeah. That mother fucker's of destroyer. He does. He's a destroyer. We don't want to be, we don't want to be in front of them. And that shows you how fucking tough DC is. Yeah. That guy twice I throwed everything. I had him, everything I had, I, I need him in the face. Uh, kicked him in his body. Sometimes I hit him. I say like goes like this. I mean he just, he just put, he just kept going. DC's an animal, a four wheel drive, just kept on going on, whatever. And he just, same pay. Same Pace. Yeah. If I fired them again, I will, I will. I will not stand in this book. I want to stand in front of him. So you think that was the critical error right in front of 100% reach advantage? Yeah. I respect that. He's wrestling too much.

Speaker 1:          00:51          So yeah, if I found them again, I would do it a way different way. Yeah. I'm sure he'd do something different too though. Right? He probably do. You probably do, but it's still do one thing and call it like, oh all the time. Just keeps moving forward. That's what it does. That's what you gotta do is you've got to catch him. When he's coming down from a heavyweight, he says you've ever the towel. Like it's pushing down on it. It's so awesome. I saw that. I saw that. I want him to come down. I hope it's coming down. He can't, he can't just like, you know, take that fight. Now he know. Even if he wins, he has to come, come down and defend and fights and if he beats deep bay, he might freak Francis again. Who knows? You might fight Volkov who you know who could fight?

Speaker 1:          01:33          No, he has to fight me. It doesn't want to fight me, but it has to fight me. He has to in your mind, he has to fight. That's what I need. Yeah, that's mine. It's him or John. So John's first. You would like to be the first guy to fight John. I welcome coming back right away. Yeah, I mean, I mean, I'm trying, I'm in camp and I'm not in camp. Sorry. I'm training right. A feeling great. My shoulder's good. And I'm just waiting for an opportunity. The light heavyweight is pretty wide open right now, particularly with this decision for DC to fight against day. So we, you have, you know, it's interesting like you have, um, owes Demir who just lost, right? You got your friend Jimmy Manwell, you have a, a few guys who are at the top of the heap, you know, uh, but you're the standout right now, John being in the limbo.

Speaker 1:          02:22          Yeah. He's gone. Nobody knows what's happening with him. Stands out to you in that division. Ilir Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, I want him to find my teammates radical. I don't find my teammates really, I've been touring with him since I was, I started my career. So do you meet Jimmy? And the other is, you know, we've been saying to each other that whatever happens, we're not fighting each other, you know. Um, but, uh, yeah, the, the only, the only the only five that makes sense for me right now. It's a, it's fighting, fighting the top guys in our rank number one right now. So I can't look back. I can look down. I have to look up what, what's, what's the next up here and uh, if you take it from there, we take it from there. And, and uh, like you said with John Jones, he's in limbo.

Speaker 1:          03:07          I hope it comes back. If it doesn't come back, maybe I'll fight him in boxing. I fight him in boxing too. Why does he want to box? He's been boxing Lenny's Instagram. There's all they do is box now. Right now we're really, yeah. I haven't paid attention to his Instagram. He's boxing all the time. Yeah. Yeah. I don't see you see him coming back as a boxer though. Mcgregor money. We could. We could, yeah, that's, that's another thing. But we can think of like maybe a side show here. We can box or whatever. You just want to get in there with them somehow or another that somehow, somehow or another your competitive drive once you get in there with them. That was my, that's my, like I told you, it's, it's, it's bigger than winning the belt. That's your Mount Everest, John Joan. It is. John's out there going, yeah, he knows that. He knows that he is, but he's still got that corvette. Yo sell that thing. Get a minivan. Drive slow. It looks good. Man. Looks real good. Yeah, you do. It's gotta be so frustrating for him to be in a situation that he's in. Yeah. I can't even imagine. Yeah, I can imagine either. It's, it's fucked up. It's a crazy situation to be in.
