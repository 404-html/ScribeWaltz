Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience, but then the same guy will call mission when he was like, okay, give me one for my private collection. And so that's where they would have all the way more explicit stuff. Yeah. They, I mean they didn't have pornography back then, so they must have been beaten off to paintings and stuff. It had to be, yeah. Yeah. I mean had to be thought of as being arousal inducing. So much so that, what was it during the Victorian era where they put legs of tables, they would put dresses on them. Yeah. They would wrap it the legs of the tables because you know they are legs, they are Bayer. They may give you ideas, which I don't know about you man, but you know, look at the leg of the that that really doesn't wait for me. So the lemon law, something to it where people got so horny, right.

Speaker 1:          00:43          The table leg, smooth skin. But that's what you're doing. You really have problems. Right. When you look at the leg of a table and you got all excited, he's like, man, yeah, that's not good. No, you'll revisit your life choice. That's up until that point. It's fascinating to see. People must've agreed to that too. What's up Jamie? I just looked it up. It says it, that it originates from a satire that was written and people, I guess took it as truth, so it's not real. Yeah, I supposedly not, but they definitely did cover the lens. I think they did, but the reason why this exaggerated, since he was poking fun at Americans that did something like that, I'll come up this point of the meat. The meat is too cool. That's prosperous farmhouse parlor in 1900 and that has it covered. But this is 19 hundreds, right?

Speaker 1:          01:28          This is, um, the Victorian era is when they did this. Oh wait. Okay. 1839, an Englishman wrote a satire of American tour. He wrote the American propensity to use the word limb and place of leg, though he says the English two a two. Then he says that he visited a boarding school, young ladies, New York Strip, we, sorry, square piano forte with four limbs. Their mistress of the establishment had dressed all these four limbs in modest trousers with frills at the bottom of them. He's exaggerating or not subjects, uh, is exaggerating or not subject to speculation. He certainly poking fun or whether whether Mur, Mur, Mur, Yat Maryat is exaggerating or not is subject to speculation. He is certainly poking fun and Americans. But I can attest that having page to dozens of books showing old black and white piano photos of Victorian Interior as I saw, not one example of a table piano or any other piece of furniture with skirts around the individual legs.

Speaker 1:          02:25          That's interesting. Boom. I liked the legend so much back there. Hadn't you always heard that? I thought that from professors. I remember hearing that from a history professor. I'm old off the, you know, between boring history and a fan legend. Are we signing? Yeah. I would like to think that people were way more stupid than they were. It makes me feel good about this error. Exactly. We're in now. Yeah. You'd be this. Um, I mean, you look at the dresses that people had to wear, you know that when all the way down to the ground, I mean this is not really much different than what we see in the Middle East. It's, it's very simple. I mean, what we see in the Middle East, they have to cover their face. They hit job and the whole deal and the headscarves and that's a little, little more extreme, but not much. Yeah. I mean they, they wore shit. They went all the way to the ground. If you showed any ankle would lose their mind. It's an ankle. I crazy. Yeah. Well, you know, reputation does it. Yeah. I wonder if they were more hypersexualized than we are. I bet not. I bet because of porn we're probably more hypersexualized. Right. There's, I think different arguments there because some people say the more you write, the rest of the more than you're going to obsess with it. So that's all you think about all day. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:38          he's less likely to obsessed. Then again, there are vaults of people are so addicted to Internet porn that, I don't know if that idea works, but you know, that's the, well, Internet porn is the problem that an airport is, the availability is this. You don't even have to go some way. At least back in the day when you had VHS tapes or DVDs or something like that, you had to go to a store, you had to buy him, he had to put them into the TV at a sit back and get the remote control. Yeah. There's a process. There was work involved minors to have minor work, right? Yes. Now it's just far too easy as far as, I mean, how many people that work that have jobs go into the bathroom, locked the door and beat off. That's, there's a lot of people listening right now but are doing exactly that in that right now.

Speaker 1:          04:23          You're beaten off right now. Stop it. Go back to work. Jesus is watching. That's what I hear. Yeah. Um, it's just, it's interesting, I guess if you have to think about it. Like they were trying to control those people and trying to control their urges because it was beneficial to society. It was beneficial to society that, that these people needed to do their fair share and get to work and they couldn't just be staring at legs all day and, you know, engaging in an impure thoughts and, but you know, that's the, that's the problem. We any kind of probation, it's completely misunderstanding of the human mind works is you do not say no to seeing says you are not going to do it is yep. Guaranteeing that people are going to obsessed with this. Right. It doesn't work. There's um, how's that sad story that I heard was that I thought he was hilarious.

Speaker 1:          05:12          I can't remember where it already, but like guy goes to a zen master saying, Hey, I'm only going to be called at peace and happy. I want to be just like you. What do I need to do? Said master says, okay, just for the next 24 hours. Don't think about monkeys, guys like Walton keys. Never flipped about monkeys. Him. I was that gonna make me a light and send my myself. Dot. Shut up. Go Away. Come back in 24 hours. Don't think about monkeys. Okay. Like, okay well be cutting a light and he's going to be at peace of gay cause all I have to do is not think about monkeys. And of course the next 24 hours become the most monkey field thou shall slide. Cause that's the one he got to think about. Right? Floyd being the bore, you make sense and get taboo.

Speaker 1:          05:50          The boy, you've guaranteed that people that are to obsessed with it. Yeah, it's a like he didn't like drinking at 21 in us. Right? It's like growing up, I don't even know if there was an age in Italy where you're supposed to not drink but is not that glamorous. You know, is what your grandparents have for lunch and you know where you are, maybe 60 year old that you want to try a little wine and they give you a tiny beat saying if you have a little more, you've got a headache. So Jessica, and then one day you would do got a little more, you got a headache and you go, oh shit, you're right. Okay. Yeah, and you kind of learn how to drink rather than being like, oh wait, God awake, cool. Now we got all of these bulls and people drink. Throw up all over done.

Speaker 1:          06:31          Sales is like, touch hasn't got a hose. Why are you dwindle? Yeah. I think there's definitely a healthier attitudes than Americans' attitudes about alcohol, but also like wine is a good way to start. Like you start off a kid with whiskey shit, that's not the way to start. Yeah. One of my first times I ever got drunk was on Jack Daniels and took years for me to smell Jack. Daniel's not want to throw up. I'm sure he gets those triggers in your head. We smell it like Jagermeister. I used to smell Jaeger mine. It's like, and just be like, Yep. It's just think about just getting violently ill. Your body's trying to purge it from your system so you don't die yet. It's to to hide it from kids and tell them it's that, that it's taboo, but then you drank it. Yeah. And then they're like, oh, can't wait until these fucking people can't tell me what to do anymore to help get myself a nice cold glass of whiskey.

Speaker 2:          07:32          Yeah.
