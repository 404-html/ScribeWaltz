Speaker 1:          00:00          But you, you, you've made it out perfect man, you know, so far, so far, so far. Years will tell. Yeah. Do you worry about it? Um, not really. Um, like, uh, I try and keep my mind active. I play a lot of chess. How often you play chess? Every day. Really? Yeah. Do you play online? I play on line because whoever, whoever jumps in the battle. How good are you? Good. Yeah. Pretty good. Bully. Did you play? You know, he, he used to get mad at me cause I'd go to his house and he'd be like, you want to play chess? I go, I don't know, just play golf. Play. Just beat me him. And he was like, get out of here. Just move, bringing somebody to complain to you. Study chess. None as much as I should. Uh, I just played often. And uh, you know, when you play an offering there, you know, people will come out with the same moves and it's like, oh, I've seen this move before and know what to do.

Speaker 1:          00:55          Right. Uh, but you know, it depends. There's people that use the palms to, to, to wage war user the nights or the bishops in combination. So it really depends on what type of player they are. You're right. I'm a bully play. I like playing right. You know what he is the Joe Rogan of pool to annex of chat. Well listen, I can, my defense Lennox challenged me. He watched her. I was too late or just two people don't challenge anybody on their own table. That next challenge. Giotto came a pool before the podcast and Joe fucking cleared the table before Lennox could get one shot. Yeah, it was, it was good. It was a, that was the warm up. Well, I won the second game too, so yeah, he doesn't need the second game as well. I'm still warming up. I will go back. He's got a, he's got the time deficit.

Speaker 1:          01:42          That's a crazy game though on that table because that table has four inch pockets. Yeah, that's my practice table. Should show you a four inch bucket. Hey, wait a minute. It, uh, I have a regular table at home. Well not a regular tape. It's a diamond's got four and a half inch pockets. It's still still a little tired and normal po Po, like if you go to a pool hall, they'll give you a five inch pocket or a five and a half inch bolt. [inaudible] much fucking, I got the best. This table, you can't mess. And it's dirty right now too. So it's, it's even, it's even like the cloth. It's slow. So balls don't drop unless they go right through the same type of coffees up blood supplies. Yes. That's the most, that's the best one. Yeah. It's the best. Yeah. It's a great table. That's a 1972 pool table and some guy had it in his basement forever and my friend Dani sold it to me.

Speaker 1:          02:31          Yeah, the guy just had it sitting in his basement. It's in perfect condition. It's a basement find. Yeah, man, that's a hard table to get some clarity around this California. I love about the table. Well guess what? What? You don't want to have to walk around and take the buckets of balls out of the park. Yeah. That's annoying. Yeah, it's like ball return. They're all there. Boom. Yeah, those, those holes. When I got the crown and I got those, it's annoying. But you probably have like a decorative pool table at the house even though you've been invited many times. He's been to my house when it was with my parents and they were kind of my house as a, as a solo man.

Speaker 1:          03:09          Now, um, when you play chess, um, are you like, do you get ranked? Are you, uh, what it is? Is your, your, um, your points go up? So I'm out of 11, 11, 7,000, 1100 right now. Sorry. What is that? Well, the rankings are like, if, you know, if you're up to 14, you're a master for, so you're closing it on being a master. Well, I wouldn't call me a master yet, but you know, obviously if I get that, I'm trying to get as high as possible, but if someone talks shit and they're like Linux, I want to please not pull some chats. You'd be like, oh, okay. Yeah. See straight away what's one of the most mentally intensive games? It's probably one reason why you stay so sharp, I would imagine. Yeah. There's a time restriction. 10 minutes till you played that, that we hit the slap the clock.

Speaker 1:          03:57          Yeah. We'll on 10 minutes for a mover. 10 minutes for the whole game. For the whole game. Oh Dang. Whoa. I'm the on the, um, it's a fast game, you know, on the computer. Once you've made that move at the time goes over. It just resets. So it's good. Now. Do you ever go like to Washington square park and play those dudes done? Really? Yeah. Yeah. That's, that was, that was fun. They talk a lot of Shit, Huh? Oh yeah, they're good too. They're good. The guy was playing, was talking a lot of shit. Yeah. Yeah. Did you beat him? Um, no. Wow. You should've hit him. Why did you have to ask that question? It was just fun playing him. You're gonna be a winner all the time. And those guys are masters. It's true. I mean, good. They got nothing else going on.

Speaker 1:          04:37          Well, I mean, that's all they wanted to. I mean, when you get really good at chess, and I'm not really good at chess, but I have friends that are, they explained to you like it becomes your whole life. Like you start thinking like as you're walking down the street, you're thinking about chess. He just, it becomes a thing where it's just everything. It's all it's so it's such an intense game. Yeah. I played like four games a day. Wow. Online Tam. Yeah. What's your online name? Um, do you use an online live? Yes, I do. They don't use your real name, right? I'm going to get it right now. It's uh, oh, I made this name a long time ago and see, yeah, I'm Washington Square Park that playing some masters at MC supernatural.

Speaker 1:          05:21          Those dudes love that game though, Matt. I mean there's those guys who were there. If you go there and there'll be there every day, they fucking live for it. You know, it's, um, it's one of those things I really admire. I really admire people that get her get really, really good at chess. Trying to find 2000 Inter, 2000. What does that mean? Well, it was supposed to be Interpol thousand. It's like the name and to pull that sounds official when when people were playing, playing is integral. I think this is the government I'm planning Scia so if you're out there and you play an inter 2000 you're playing Lennox motherfucking Louis. Yeah, I was going to put my real name, but yeah, I don't want everybody to try and beat the champ. Well now they're going to send us retired writing though. Let it be known that Lennox Lewis is one of those dudes that walks around with no case on his iPhone two and it smashed it smashed.

Speaker 1:          06:18          If I tell you what happens, what happened? I was doing something. Then all of a sudden, you know, my wife said do this. And I went, whew. And it flew out of your hand. But you have the biggest hands of any human being I know. And A, and there's no, there's no phone that's gonna be big enough as you carry an iPad. Well, let me tell you, I don't know who makes these iPhones, but they may come to slip out of your hands. You know what I mean? They do. They really do like put something on that. That's grips have a case. That's the first thing I did was put a case on right. And then, um, I forgot what I had to do. You have to take it off to charge it up or some yeah, some now he got the wrong case. You get the wrong case.

Speaker 1:          06:58          Whoever sold your cases an Asshole, I guess it doesn't have a thing where you could just stick a hole in it. Look at it. Never run jre case. What could these guys challenged? They're all challenging me or they now I've got a boy called this game right now. They're gonna come after you now though. They find out they could play it. I liked that they're doing it while we're doing the podcast live. I ain't you look, he's going to get obsessed. The wheels are spinning. The competitive drive. Let me tell you, my wife gives me problems on this. He says, you know, he's playing chess that women don't understand that you playing chess and focusing. I'm trying to tell her, listen, I'm up to this score point. Don't interrupt because it affects my score, but I need you now. I needed to do we need to do this? That's five minutes please. Five minutes. You know she's looking at me weird, but she's gotten better. She's actually, are you playing chess? So and then she leaves you alone. Yeah. That's good. I think because I got mad a couple of times a problem.

Speaker 1:          07:55          Yeah. Big bully with his wife. Jean. Play chess with people other than Lennox. No, I can't play chess, so I don't know. I can't either. Maybe you and I played together. We should really learn the gap. Yeah. Herded together. I want to video this game. Do you have any fucking disgusting? Well, you know what? You could coach the game. No, this is the first time I was, I was, I would ever see a chess game turned into checkers. Mm. Oh Man. It's like I said, we're fighting. How, how do you play this game again? How rude. All this coming from man doesn't really know how to play pool. Oh, you're right. You're right. I play billiards, billiards, pocket billiards. You ever played three cushioned billiards? You know what that is? One, two, three and then you have to get it. The whole of the holes, is that the one with the bumpers?

Speaker 1:          08:43          Yeah. Well the whole table so you have to touch it. Yeah. Yeah. That's Russia. Russian isn't, no, but I mean Russians play it until a big, it's real big in South America. It's real big in Mexico. It's real big in parts of Europe. Real big in Asia. Yeah. So different game there's a to two different color balls and like is he the two white balls and a red ball or two red balls and white ball and you got to, or sometimes it's a yellow ball, red ball and a white ball. And the idea is you make contact with one ball and then you have to hit three cushions and then make contact with the second ball. Wow. Yeah, it's very complicated to watch. It's, well, if you know how to play it, it's good to watch. But if you don't know how to play it, it's, it's a thing about what I like about pools. I liked when the ball's disappear, like you make a ball goes away, it goes in that hole by bitch. You sink the ball. It's like a, it's got a finality to it. It feels good. But with that it just clicks. It's like just Ding, Ding, ding, click. But the people love it. Love it. It's a very intellectual game cause it's all about geometry. It's all angles and spin and you know, I'm not good at that either. Yeah, it's tricky. It's a tricky game. I'm not good at it.
