Speaker 1:          00:00          What was it like finding Bernard who, you know, and I don't know if this is the stage stage I want to fighting Bernard was, it was um, totally different than what I expected. What'd you expect? I expect him to be tricky and sneaky and just a very crafty and obviously I'm experienced. Um, I did jump up two weight classes to take that fight and um, but at the same time, that was not an 80% Kelly public. And this is true and this is documented. Um, I have it on my phone and I was going to actually bring that out, but that fight I sport, you know, three times for that maybe for the fourth time was with an arm brace and then it went into it and I'd never said anything cause I'm the type person, I don't want to have people think that was making excuses.

Speaker 1:          00:53          I love Bernard and I think he's, uh, one of the greatest of all time, greatest middleweights. But that was not that night. You know, I came down, we had what's wrong, what was right, I had bronchitis, I was sick, I was running a temp. Actually in the locker room, we had to go through what to commission. We almost took the inhaler for it. Then we found out through the commission that you cannot take that cause it's steroid. So we had to go to the nasal, um, or not nasal to the pill, oral pill. Uh, we had it in the locker room. I don't know if you ever heard of a Guy Thomas houser. He writes, you mean he used to write from New York Times? He does a lot of big box in books. He was a nerd and houser don't, he's not one side. What's anybody?

Speaker 1:          01:35          He's Bryce. What? He knows what he sees and that's the truth. And um, he was a nerd when it commission came in. They were going through my prescription, you know, they ever taking a temperature, uh, giving me the exam and that's what happened. How it was a look Dardick fight with what, uh, of all people, what was wrong with your arm? You had burst, burst, sac bursitis, societies, bursitis in your elbow. And you know, that came into an issue. And we sport, you know, like I said, it was a handful. It might've been more than three or four, but it wasn't a lot because usually in training camp you do three days a week for about eight week camp for about six, six and a half weeks. And it was because of your elbow that you couldn't spar. Yeah. You know, cause he didn't want to keep hitting it.

Speaker 1:          02:16          And then I didn't like just the way I am. I didn't like having a brace on it or not. And um, so that was an issue and there was a lot of things that sometimes if you could go back and you wish you could do it over again, but there was a lot of other things going on. Why we didn't postpone to fight. First of all is sold out. And uh, the Youngstown people bottle or tickets, um, we had the issue with the Paul Williams fight, you know, that that fell through. So I can't, I just came off fighting Gary Lockett, who was really not a well known name, a household name. So if I were to postpone that fight, the backlash on that would have been bad, really bad. And you know, so it was more to ego thing I think. And worried about what everybody was going to think.

Speaker 1:          03:02          Taking nothing away at all from an s where I wanted to tap into taking nothing away from Bernard Hopkins unfortunately against a guy like Bernard Hopkins. I had to have that happen to me is what socks and, and he was a tremendous fighter. I mean, he did things in there. A lot of times I've seen him make a moves that I knew what he was doing and I just couldn't pull the trigger on it. Um, and he was fast and he was strong. And then there was times that he just did some crafty things also that, you know, got to me and, and his body work in that fight slowed me down a lot. But it was just one of them fights where I could honestly say that that was not an 80% Kelly Pollick. And that could be honest to say if I was 100%, I don't know if I would have won that fight.

Speaker 1:          03:46          And I'll be honest about it. I'm not going to be the guy that's, that comes there and says, well, I thought it was 100% I'll or knock them out. No, it was Bernard Hopkins, you know? Um, when you think about your legacy and you think about looking back at your, your career, those kinds of fights where you had to take it when you were compromised, um, how do those factor in to do those fuck with your head? Mm, yeah. That never a bad way, right? But enough for you. Like if I was 100%, yeah. You know, I got an a buddy to the international boxing hall of fame over the summer and it was cool as hell and it'd be there and you start seeing the inductees and everything and I start, you start breaking down your career. Like, am I, am I able to qualify for this?

Speaker 1:          04:25          You know, and it's so, so going to get pissed off who didn't get in because I got in and I look at it and I break it down a couple of ways. I say 40 and two with 34 knockouts is a hell of a record. You know, I held the belts for over three years. Um, I be a handful of guys that were legit when I beat them. And then I, then I look at the fight though I fought Bernard Hopkins and I got my ass whooped in that fight and there was no other way of putting it, you know, it's the truth. So how much did that damage? You know, uh, people remembering that nobody looks at the fact of the two way class jump and they call him back down and defending against a very game. Antonio Rubio. And then of course the Martinez fight, which a lot of people, and it was documented and, and on Hbo with the commentators, you know, the weight issue in that fight.

Speaker 1:          05:15          But what was the way it, it shouldn't know fine. Well, how we had to get down. That was my last fight at middle weight, you know, trying to cut the weight. I was 29 at the time and another great fighter. It happened. It was tough with the weight. Um, I really can't use that as an excuse though, cause I don't know. But you know, I know I was doing good in the ninth round. I did hit a wall. A lot of people try to use the cut and I think even without the cut, the same result would have happened though, you know, he would have boxed my ears off the last four rounds. It was just one of them things that there was nothing you could do. So when I, when I have some up my career, I look at those fights and I, and I know personally that it could have been different, but at the same time I'm very happy and content with the way my career went. You know, I was 40 and two, um, my last four or five at one of my last four fights, you know, before I retire. So I went out winning, um, and, and I was done with the sport. I truly was. And so I, I think right now I'm, I'm kind of content and happy with my career. Of course. I think anybody says could have been better and I wish it was better. It may be a little bit, but I'm not going to have ever beat myself up over it.
