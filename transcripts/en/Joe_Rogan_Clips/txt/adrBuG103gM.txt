Speaker 1:          00:00          Now, what did you wear in terms of like a base layer and we was there concerned about you sweating while you're pulling all that weight, especially initially when it was 375 pounds.

Speaker 2:          00:10          Yeah. So you know, one of the famous lines that, you know, people who have been in the polar environments will say is if you sweat, you die. Um, and you know, it's maybe a little bit of hyperbole but it's not far from the truth, which is you start sweating and you stop for even 30 seconds. You're clothes are literally freezing to your body. And so it was this crazy kind of kind of balance of being able to pull this sled, get your heart rate elevated enough to keep your body warm but not too warm that you were sweating. And so any second I would start sweating, I would strip layers off. So there was times, especially when there was no wind, it's still be ambient temperature minus 20 minus 25 but I would just have like a thin gore tex jacket on and one base layer. That's it. I mean, we were in Marino. I Marino actually itches my skin, although it's really good, but for me, I'm a little bit allergic to it. Um, so I work synthetic fabric.

Speaker 1:          00:58          Did they have a synthetic that completely mimics Marino in terms of the way it, when it's moist, you still stay warm?

Speaker 2:          01:03          Yeah. So mark, Marina, I honestly, Marino is amazing fabric for that reason. Um, unfortunately for me, like I said, it just gets weird.

Speaker 1:          01:09          Tastes my skin. So funny that you could suffer, can't have clothes on, maybe feel that.

Speaker 2:          01:17          Uh, no, but, uh, so I used a synthetic, but it's causing me, are you using like w w what I was using, mountain hardware base layers and then actually my outer layer, so is this Norwegian company called Bergen's of Norway. They don't sponsor me, but they actually, believe it or not, the Norwegians know a thing or two about being in the polar environment. And so they've designed a really good jacket and pant that sexually really breathable and really good. And then I suit sewed a for rough, uh, onto the edge. So a wolf, a wolf, uh, s, uh, for rough on the outer side of the hood. I think it's Wolffia. Wolfer will for thought you were saying Whoa, whoa. And I was like, it sounds like wolf, you know more about this than me. I'm not the output. All of know your audience. I have not, I have not a big hunter myself. I've never, never had had done that, a lot of that. But uh, yeah, that's a wolfer

Speaker 1:          02:01          well, they, they know how to survive in the cold. Yeah, exactly. So the base layer is a synthetic. What is the material that it's made out of?

Speaker 2:          02:08          The base layer is, yeah, to think it's a synthetic. I'm like a poly polypropylene

Speaker 1:          02:13          so that when it sweats, it dries quickly. Is it your idea?

Speaker 2:          02:16          Yeah. So it sweats. It dries quickly, but the idea was just to not get it wet, so basically stripped down as much as possible. Um, but like literally I'd go from that and then of course I needed to eat and drink every, whatever, 30 minutes or whatever, actually more like every hour. So I'd stop. So I'd stop in the front of my sled. I had a huge puffy down jacket, like a massive like Michelin man, huge puffy down jacket. So even if you're stopping for a minute to drink water before even trying to do that, boom, put the big jacket on because that's how cold or how cold you can get immediately from stopping. I mean, it's just so much colder than when pulling the sled. Your heart rate stays up and keeps you pretty warm.

Speaker 1:          02:50          I would imagine like your, your hands and your feet to that would be a real issue, right? The small digits.

Speaker 2:          02:55          Yeah. I mean, you know, frostbites real for sure. Um, hands of the gloves. That's why some of this stuff I was doing in the training of get my hands with a dexterity. You know, you'd have to tie all these knots with big gloves, mittens on. You can't take your gloves off for any sizable period of time. Uh, if you look back on a lot of my photos, I've actually got tape on my face over across my nose and my cheeks. And that's because I started getting tiny little bits of frostbite on the bottoms of my nose and on, on my cheeks because I'd wear a full face mask buff everything but even tiny little, you know, one, you know, needle prick of wind on your face throughout the day and that cold it's going to turn into a cold injury. And so I started getting a few cold injuries on my face.

Speaker 2:          03:32          Nothing, you know, too bad you're looking at Greece, your face up or anything like mostly the, the tape. Um, and then so I had a little bit of like Vaseline or like chapstick type of stuff on some of the batteries. The one thing actually that I did that I'd never done before, we'd actually worked when I was a tip that I got, which was my fingers started cracking really, really bad from the cold. And so they were like really painful and I actually was pouring, putting super glue into all of those. Basically little micro cuts on my fingers, which when someone told me that as a trick, I was like, really? But turns out it's actually a really good trick. So that's kind of super gluing these cuts on my fingers back together. Um, and that actually worked reasonably well. I'll things kids. I mean, I was all things considered is the operative word, but yeah.

Speaker 2:          04:13          Wow. So you're wearing the, what about your eyes? So I'm wearing, I'm wearing a goggles. Um, but you know, funny enough, you know, I had a couple of, uh, you know, fancier, nicer ski goggles with me. Um, but yeah, there's the tape on my face right there. Uh, but, uh, but yeah, it's like, that's actually just like the normal KT tape, like a physio tape that you'd see like athletes wearing. And I just had it in my repair kit. It wasn't meant for this purpose, but I was like, what do I have that I could put on my face to block it a little bit better? Um, but I had those goggles on some of the time, but actual, the goggle that I wore the most was one that you would might use for motocross. Um, because it has like a plastic face mask over the front of it cause the wind when it was blowing, it would just kind of blow around.

Speaker 2:          04:56          So sometimes I had this flea stripped over my face, but it blow too much. Um, and so I had this more plastic face mass gas. So that's, that's the, that's when you could see lookout frozen. It's frozen. It is on the inside. Oh my God, man. There. And then like this neoprene mask underneath. So I had like double faced back double tape, like anything to just, you know, keep me, keep me warm. Suspected that it was so high above sea level there. Yeah. Yeah. So you've got whatever it is, 9,000, 300 feet at the South Pole. So it's basically just like elevated ground, but it seems flat. Right. But yeah, I started at sea level, so I'm not only add like how much are you going uphill all the way to the south coast for the first 40 sub days, I pulled that sled up hill completely, so it was, think freaks me out.
