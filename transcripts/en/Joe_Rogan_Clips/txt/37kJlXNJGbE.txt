Speaker 1:          00:01          Gear. It doesn't give you that part, you know? Yeah. What was the, um, so you had gone through a series of ketamine therapy.

Speaker 2:          00:10          Yeah, I did. Uh, I did the tms. The uh, cause I was looking to at the last time was here was this alliance, Dermal Mag, transcranial magnetic stimulation and which worked that men, the problem was, and I think, I don't know if I talked about on here or not, I h someone gave me some HGH. Did they tell you that human growth hormone? Yeah, basically. So I did tms, which transcranial magnetic stimulation, 45 sessions. It worked great. Like it literally stopped taking, it takes like 35 minutes and they just put like electrodes on you are so I think I have video. Um, they put, uh, they put, um, they, yeah, they put video on, uh, looking, Chris rock t sends me every single uh, uh, rape thing.

Speaker 1:          01:03          Oh my God. Everything that comes out, every sink, every page six f literally he sent me 25 of these. I don't know. It's just like a thing now because then we go like, I just like literally, it's just like a tick. So for the morning there's so many guys not real Batali. And by the way, the more salacious they can make these stories, the better. They were talking about some room that Mario would take people up to and the third floor was the rape room. I'm like, what in the fuck off me laugh is the SEO habit.

Speaker 2:          01:32          Yeah. The uh, you know what makes me laugh is the, um, the pictures of Louis got progressively worse and worse.

Speaker 1:          01:39          Oh, the ones that get fined like the New York Times, I was waiting for them to just put up a picture of Lee Harvey Oswald fucking hits. You don't have to find the shittiest, the guilty is looking picture of this. So much video of him beating off air, beating on, you know, play that video like this. This is the last time

Speaker 2:          01:59          was here or this is unlined? Yes. From last time you were here. Yeah. Wow. Look at that, man. Give me some volume. If I am talking about, I went to this, whoa dude, that sound is like an Mri. So it's an APP. That's what it is. Yes, that's right. We talked about last week right here. Um, the uh, but uh, case. So then the problem was after that I did HGH for someone gave me some HGH and I was like, yeah, I'll fucking take you. I don't want to give a shit. Yeah, I'll take HGH. I'm always looking for an advantage. And I started having panic attacks from Hga. Yes. Which is a, we, it's a narrow side effect, but it's one of the side effects of HGH. Basically. It like supercharged my whole system. I started having panic attacks on stage. I had a panic attack the night before. I take three mikes. Why couldn't go onstage? Spade was supposed to bring me on and I told Adam, I was like, I can't go on. I literally couldn't breathe.

Speaker 1:          02:57          Wow. The night before you

Speaker 2:          03:00          fell? Thankfully, yes. I thankfully didn't get one that night. Like, oh my God, dude, trust me, trust me. And then I, and then I had anxiety for months. Literally like, just like when people say I have anxiety, I had never had anxiety. I was like, I'm not an anxious person and wouldn't even know what that's like. It's fucking miserable. It's, to me it was worse than depression because you're agitated and like, you just feel like static. It just was like a static over your body. It was like, you're, you just have like this, like cortisol, snow in your, and it sucked. So I went back on a, on a Zoloft, um, to, and then it ended the

Speaker 1:          03:48          anxiety now. But you were trying to get yourself off of it.

Speaker 2:          03:52          Yeah. So now I'm going to go, I'm, I'm back. I just stopped taking Zoloft for like two weeks ago. How did you can't, I feel actually really good because, oh, here's what I didn't say. I also micro dosed do, uh, while I was on Zoloft, I microdose shrooms, uh, like three times, which is actually like pretty fun. It's Super Fun, but it's like not daunting. It's not, you're not like, it's not trippy, right? You're not like, oh yeah, you just feel good. Uh, I did that three times a did LSD once and I, I'm thinking of, so now I'm going off and, and interesting happened when I microdose I got significantly less angry just as like an operating principle. Like I was just like, oh, I'm less angry. Like I just didn't feel as like snappy and shitty. Um, like for a long, for like an like an over big period.

Speaker 1:          04:54          I've got a buddy of mine who's a world champion kickboxer remind her doses and he fights on it fights high on mushrooms. Do they test for it or are they, it's just, nope, that's fine. I fucking people up while he's on mushrooms. That's great. And I mean better than he's ever looked in his past. He said he could see things coming before they happen. Yup. He said he'd literally feels like he's got some sort of psychic ability when he's sparring. Like he sees what guys are doing and if you watch him fight, he just looks way sharper than he's ever looked before at home. Boys doing mushrooms.

Speaker 2:          05:21          Yeah. Then that's the, so I've been, I stopped taking it all off because you can't, uh, you can't be on it. And do I have a game? Uh, you can, uh, you risk serotonin syndrome, which is like it too much serotonin in your body or Nah. Yeah. Yeah. And so

Speaker 1:          05:38          were the first guy that tell me about five HTP before we even started selling it and all that before we started having a mood, you were telling me about five HTP and that you were at Sandy Anto

Speaker 2:          05:49          told me about no shit. Yeah. Cause I, he saw me some ecstasy and he was like, yeah, and also take the next day and I was like Mongo and then I like research and I was like, oh, I should just take. So I still take that five inch. I think it's good for weight loss. Really. Um, it like when I take five HDP, I'm just not hungry. Um, it like that was the other sort of weird side effect of the micro dosing. My appetite went down like significantly across the board. Wonder how much of the appetite is not really how much food you need. But rather you need something to do. Yeah. Or it's just like, at this time of day I do this. Um, but I ended up like losing 10 pounds. That's interesting to me. Like one 50 from, I've lost 12 pounds from like one 59 to one 47.

Speaker 2:          06:44          Wow. Yeah. But it's not like a, not starving myself or anything. Right. So you didn't feel uncomfortable? No, not at all. He was like, yeah. Yeah. Do you monitor your diet? Are you, do, are you eating healthy? Yeah. Like I got my blood tested probably three months ago and everything was good. Do you, are you eating sugar and bread and things like I've eaten, I've stopped. Uh, I've eaten. I used to be a big dessert person and I kind of just like, I think the mushrooms might've maybe just kind of like, Eh, you, I think that you don't, um, and don't sugar, you know, the thing with sugar is you don't need it for three days if you don't want it. Right. Like you just, your body doesn't like, you got to fucking get us some sugar. You're just like, Eh, I'm good. Once you cut free.

Speaker 2:          07:34          Yeah, and especially if you're really conscious about what you're eating in terms of like probiotics and things that sort of help the landscape, the biome landscape and make sure you've got healthy things in there. I think that's so significant in the more researchers that I talked to and the more people that are nutrition experts to start talking about your gut biome and how important it is to take the proper probiotics. I think it affects your personality. I think it affects your immune system. I think it affects virtually the path of your life that you take depending upon what foods you eat. It has a different effect on how you live your life. Well that's, meditation does the same thing cause you're like you get a feeling for meditation and then you're like, do I want to spoil this with like garbage thinking or behavior like running?

Speaker 2:          08:24          Just try to bring a bit of that in know in my every day. Yeah. I mean that's the tank for me. Yeah. The tank is literally forgot about tanks until you and I'm like I live like a block from float lab. You got to go like I, I went, I went. I think you must. How long have you been doing this? 2002 was the first time I got one. When did you start doing the podcast? I think you told me about it. You told me about it. I went to float lab. Had the thought in the, in the tank. You got to love something. Literally that was the thought. I had an and then I got a dog.

Speaker 1:          09:09          Literally like he's always like, I fucking like that, that I like that shit. Like and I just forget that it exists. The tanks? Yeah, I think they're giant. I think it's like one of them. It's one of those things that requires you to block off a chunk of your time, so if you're a busy person it's hard to, it's hard to pull it off, but I think it's like one of the most important things you could do. How often are you doing? Well, I haven't done in a long time because I took the one out of my basement and I had it installed here. It took me a few, few times off and we just got to put in two days ago. So I haven't even been in it. So I haven't been a tank at all and three months. Oh Wow. Two months, two months, something like that. How often do you think you'll do it now? A couple of days a week. A couple of days a week is good. If I can give myself two days a week, I'm happy. Do you ever go in and just think about your daughters? Yeah, sure. Yeah. Yeah. So it's not, I don't like have a plan. Sometimes I have a plan, like maybe I'll have a bit and I'm trying to work out and I just like this bed. It's just clunky. There's a part of it that's clunky. I'll smoke some pot and climbing that tank and think about it. There's a

Speaker 2:          10:13          in the, in the, the, there's like a pre fucking syllabus for the Ibogaine and it's like you need to come with questions. Ooh for Ibogaine. Well for sweet lady Ibogaine. Whoa. And it's like I have to write. And then a friend of mine was like, can you ask a question for me? It's like, no, I don't think that's legal.

Speaker 1:          10:40          Okay. So where Lucy needs, it's about what's going on with her feet,

Speaker 2:          10:51          but I'm like looking forward to asking, asking big questions. Although I gotta say the last year has been very revealing for me in terms of like what, what's important.
