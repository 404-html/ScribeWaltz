Speaker 1:          00:00          Now, let me ask you this, cause this is the, we're in the biggest crisis in terms of immigration, in terms of national discussion. The biggest discussion of it than I can ever remember right now with this wall shit where the government is completely shut down and no one's budging on either side and all these government workers are not getting paid and psalm because Trump wants $5 billion for this wall. I'm not, let's just, in an ideal world, it would be ideal if the way the world worked was the way America works, where you can just go every you want. That'd be the ideal world. If the whole world was America in the, in the sense of you can go to New Mexico, you didn't have to get paperwork signed. You don't have to know. It has to tell you whether or not you're allowed to go visit or not go visit.

Speaker 1:          00:47          He just drive there. That's, that's a nice thing about America. It's almost like Europe, but you don't need a passport. Not In, it's like Europe. I know you guys have been around longer and all that good stuff. That's not what I mean. I mean in terms of there's a bunch of different fields. It's all speaking one language, but there's a big difference between visiting Montana and visiting Miami. You know, if you go to billings, Montana and hang out with the local folk at a coffee shop and then you go to some fucking crazy after I already after hours party in Miami on Miami beach at four in the morning and p did, he shows up and fucking, you know, and as all these celebrities and people are doing coke on the floor and like what the fuck is this? This is a different world. It's a different world and it's a bunch of these different worlds.

Speaker 1:          01:28          New York City's a different world. You know, La is a different world. You're allowed to go there. Wouldn't it be great if the whole world was like that? You can just kind of go wherever you wanted to go and it would all sort itself out. The idea is you can't because it would fuck up our quality of life and would make us less safe. And I get the argument. Certainly you don't want to bring in criminals and murderers. You don't want drug dealers making their way into this country and starting gang violence and all that stuff. Yes, you're absolutely right. And to deny that, I think it's pretty fucking foolish.

Speaker 2:          01:58          Yeah. I think it's a matter of like there's a lot to it. It's a fluid. The border is always going to be fluid and it needs to be fluid. You know, we need the immigrant spirit of coming in and a lot of them do start small businesses when you know, and again, when they're brought in legally. Um, and so how do you, how do you create a flow of people that is good for us? Cause they say most of the immigrants that come here are the smartest, sharpest people, most driven and wherever they're from. So we're actually drawing a really good, you know, they talk so much about the criminals, but the truth is most of them that are coming over here are the ones that probably have the most to offer to this country. Well. Exactly like our parents' generation. Like our grandparents, like my grandparents. Like when did your, your grandparents come over here, it was it your grandparents or 1910 my grandparents. Yeah, mine as well that your grandfather was one of 13 and 12 of them came over here and they lived in a two room fucking mud hut. Somehow they kept finding the money to send one kid over at a time. Like usually when they were about 15

Speaker 1:          03:00          horse. Crazy shit. Yeah. See that kind of shit is what I'm talking about. Like those kind of people, shouldn't they be allowed to come here? That's how this thing got started. The, the real problem is that their spots that suck as the real problem. It's like we were talking about like white privilege. White privilege is not the problem. The problem is racism. Racism doesn't exist in everyone's exactly the same and then we're okay and then we don't need to worry about white privilege. What the real problem that you're not getting, you're not getting racist things thrown at you the way black people are. Yeah, for sure. But that's not the problem. The problem is racist things being thrown at black people. It's not that I don't get it right. It's say you get it right and it's like it took to highlight the fact that it's not happening to me. I get what you're saying. But the real pro, I think it's a distraction that the real problem is the racism itself. The real problem is the, when you see actual Nazis in 2018, 2019 actual ones, real ones like not, not just dressing up cause they think it's a hoot. We, oh mom, rebel. I'm fucking hell. The road, I've got a piece of tape under my nose. The same, there's a fucking people that aren't really Nazis, but they're dumb. Yeah. Right. But then you see real Nazi in 2019 you're like, okay, that's real racism. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          04:18          Now when they go into, uh, I was in Portland and they said there's regular clashes like once a month there's a demonstration and it's either the alt right having a demonstration and then the a, what do they call them? The something far Antifa Antifa show up and they have regular fights and it's fucking Nazis. God Damn. Oregon's a fucked up state because it was originally, there were no black people allowed in Oregon. That's the, that's the, you know, cause now Portland is, is very progressive, super progressive, super veracity, but there's no black people there. So it seems there are, it's, he feels a little hollow that when you're there rubbing shit. I just did New Year's Eve shows there and they were, they were, it was all white. It was all white. It was weird. That is weird. There. Dot. If I was black, I would go to Portland and a second, you'd have so many friends instantly. Everybody wants to high five. You have you over for dinner.
