Speaker 1:          00:00          It's calling someone outright today. It's so strange how, you know, I don't know if you know, but all in the world to stand up comedy used to be progressive liberal, like, like weird coffee shop type rooms. It was all comedy. They don't even use that term anymore, right? Because it's so toxic. And I try to avoid saying, I'll try. When you say alternative media all the time, and this has happened over the course of just a couple of years. I mean, the, the, the thing is shifted and it's moving and evolving and morphing so quickly. You want to know what's really crazy. For years, I, my Wikipedia page at claimed that I invented a Zeppelin, Zeppelin like a blimp. Yes. Yeah. It's funny, right? Well, Wikipedia said I was Brian Callan's brother for a decade here. Here's the thing. When I went to Sweden, I specifically stated, uh, let me, let me, let me, let me back up.

Speaker 1:          00:49          Paul Joseph Watson of infowars put out a call saying, I challenge any journalists to spend a weekend in Malmo and I'll cover your costs. Everybody's bombarding him saying, Oh, pay me, pay me. And he's kind of just ignoring it. People are threatening to sue him. You better pay. You promised. I had already set up a go fund me for the project before, I believe it was before he announced. I made a video about it saying Donald Trump said x, Y, and Z. We're going to go to the story. When I saw he made this call, I think it was actually Emily who noticed it, I said, hey, I'll do it. And he was like to be on, I think it had something like, I was just taking the Piss, but yeah, sure, I'll send you a donation. And I laughed and I was like, hey man, I'll take, you know, if he wants to throw money at my go fund me.

Speaker 1:          01:26          Here's what, what ends up happening is people then claim I was uh, I went to there because Paul Joseph Watson Challenge challenged me. Not True. Um, he donated about 9% of our total fund that we raised and I was already planning on going there. Wikipedia. Uh, there was a challenge on the, on my Wikipedia page where they, someone said, you wrote Tim Pool went there because it Paul just Watson challenged him to, that's not true. What's your proof? This youtube video from Tim Pool where he says, we've already arranged this. We're not going here because of politics of Watson. That response, that's not a reliable source. Someone came back with a reliable source. You know it, it was a Huffington post article that quoted my youtube video.

Speaker 1:          02:09          How's that? I don't understand. Why couldn't you just take my word for it? Why did you have to get Huffington post to just quote me? That was apparently so that's enough. I guess. So the reason I bring this up is because what happens then if you're a conservative and a bunch of friends who work for various news organizations all at the same time write 10 articles saying Joe Rogan is all right now on Wikipedia at 10 articles pop up immediately saying this is a fact. 10 different organizations have written it and there it is in your, in your page. And the crazy thing is the UK does this all the time, you know, they call various personalities. All right? They call Sargon, they call Dank Ula. Yeah. Just go to Wikipedia and look up the phrase, it means white nationalists, neo confederate. It's like literally about a white ethno state.

Speaker 1:          02:52          These people have denounced this and that. And you know, it's like with, with Sargon, avocado was a really fascinating phenomenon on patrion where all of a sudden these left wing outlets, sad Sargon was banned for, uh, going after the alt right. And I'm like, well, hold on. You've written in the past that he was all right. Well, you, when you say you like the media is not these, these various organizations, same organizations, but different authors. Well, I don't want to, I don't want to. Okay. But not the same journalists. Um, I, I will lean towards, I believe. Yes. Because it's, it's, it's so, so whenever it's convenient, they just throw it, throw that there are some people who write. The problem is if I May, if I named these people, they're going to, they're going to point their pens in my direction and then all of these things are going to swing at me. And the other thing too is I don't want to, I don't want to brigade them. It's not important anyway. What's really important is the actual reality of how it was done. There are, I really want to name this organization, it's, it's one of the prominent, well known, but they repeatedly write stories that are just so over the top. I roll my eyes and I'm like.
