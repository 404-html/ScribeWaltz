Speaker 1:          00:01          And we're live. You've fucking handsome bastard. Look at you. Oh yeah. This shit. What's going on man?

Speaker 2:          00:09          What's going on? Um, every time I've done this once before and I've watched, you know, throughout the years and when I come in here,

Speaker 1:          00:21          I get a little, um, nervous. Why? You're a guy who knows a lot about everything and I don't know a lot of, I don't know a lot about everything. I know enough to make it seem like I know a lot about everything. Whatever you're doing, it's, you know more than I do. Right? Like, like we were on your treadmill out there and you go, it's 13%. What did you say? 10% more difficult than regular running. Okay. I forgot the fact. What you just said from the time we walk in, I lost it so I don't, I don't have the repension that I wish I had some Alpha brain. I need something. Do we have any here? Is that what I'm missing in my diet? Alpha? It's a, what's interesting though is that people will come up to me with shit that happened just a few years ago and I'm like, I don't remember that at all.

Speaker 1:          01:24          Like I think you have a certain amount of room in your brain and my brain is always deleting stuff that it doesn't think it needs anymore. And then shoving in new things. Like sometimes someone will tell me about something, I'm like, what are you talking about? And they're like, you don't remember there was the guy with no arms who drove us around. I went, what? And then I have to go. Oh yeah. It's like I find the folder in my head and like, oh, there it is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then we went to the pool hall and Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. And then I'll remember. Gotcha. But if, yeah, it's just a, for whatever reason, this, uh, I can only, I only keep things that I'm interested in. Gotcha. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:04          I just wish I could retain a lot of the things I either see or hear to then recall it in a conversation.

Speaker 1:          02:11          You can, but you got to write things down. You got to like want to recall things. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:16          it's a problem. I don't do a lot of writing as far as like a notepad or anything to just take notes.

Speaker 1:          02:21          When you write your act, do you write it in your head or do you write it on paper or

Speaker 2:          02:25          it's all audio? Just audio. I'll go to the comedy store. I record it and I listened to it on the way home and then I'll go, oh, maybe I'll do this next time. Maybe I'll do that. I'll take that out and this out. And then, uh, so there's no writing. My Act is more recalling stories then sitting in a room going, oh, I think this is funny. So that's kind of how I work. But, uh, yeah, the reason I say that to start off is just like, I see you go down a lot of different paths on the podcast and I often the gold man, if I was sitting in that chair, could I add to conversation? And a lot of times it's, no, I can't kid just because for whatever the reason, I, uh, I just feel like I need to be a little bit more, um, well-read.

Speaker 2:          03:13          How often you read? Uh, like I read the Goggins Book. Yeah. And that fucking book, yeah. And Life Dot Dude had, huh? It's sad life. But then on the flip side, inspiring to, you know, a guy like myself were, you know, I'm running, I'm running say, or I'm working out and I thought of this guy, go, you know what, let's, let's put another mile into this. So, uh, yeah. I mean, I'm just now starting to get into a little bit more books than I have in the past because in the past, to be honest with you, I haven't really, I haven't really read much.

Speaker 1:          03:47          I try to read a one new thing a week. And the way I try to do it is, uh, I have, uh, uh, I use a lot of audio books, but I also read books. So I go back and forth in between them in between reading and audio books. But I find for whatever reason, I retained more with audio books than I do with reading. I, maybe it's my add or something like that, because when I'm reading, I kind of have to back up sometimes. Like I'll go through a whole paragraph for, I'm thinking about some other shit while I'm reading, and then I got to go, okay, asshole backup, reread that, go over it again. You know?

Speaker 2:          04:21          That's what I find. I, I, my mind wanders like, yeah.
