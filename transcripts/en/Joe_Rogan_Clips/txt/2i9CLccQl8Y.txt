Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience like that's been solved. You know, I, I'm into the geopolitical and domestic policy shit, right? That's where I, I was drawn more about what's really going on, you know, behind the news, all that sort of stuff. This is bullshit. And I was lucky to train a lot of law enforcement and then military high level military and get connected to Intel guys who go, pat, we need to talk. Like now you're completely off. Let me explain things to you. Right. It was like, as far as like, what will you completely off about? Well, I can tell you what I was right about when I called up my buddy and I go, hey, uh, four years ago, whatever it was, four and a half years ago, I go, we're funding Isis, aren't we? He goes, well, yeah. Yeah. Those the go between guy. What do you think?

Speaker 1:          00:44          I'll news row Isis friggin Al Shabaab. W what are you fucking think fun dices to take out Syria? It was obvious, right? The mujahideen in Afghanistan was the frigging take out the Russians, but the way I looked at it was when that was going on funding, the mujahideen was to bankrupt Russia. Right? Right. We wanted them to go bankrupt and it worked. Reagan was, was a genius in that park. The diabolical part, of course, is rushing in America, both fighting over the resources of Afghanistan, but Isis was just theirs. That's some weird shit. When you have a 50,000 man army just appear out of nowhere with professional cameramen and editors and producers and directors making the high level films that they were putting out where it's every three seconds, they're cutting different angles professionally put together films of people being burned. I go, this is this.

Speaker 1:          01:38          This is too weird. This is too weird. You know when people stop talking about, do you remember when they blame Bengazi on some bullshit video, some video that someone made? Right. What's it like the tears of Muslims or something like that or I forget that. Nobody even knew it existed. Nobody knew it existed and everybody knew it was bullshit and they were pushing that as a narrative. Like this is what was the motivation behind. And everybody was like, what have you had Perato on your show? No. Who's this? Uh, Toronto's last name. Former seal. What's his name? Toronto Peel. Rol Name. T a. His last name's Perato, but I think he's a former seal. There were several seals obviously that ran to try and help, uh, the ambassador and some of the other guys, Toronto lived through it, but you know, he, when he talks about it, they're moving massive amounts of weapons through Libya, into Syria, into other places in the Middle East, right there.

Speaker 1:          02:31          It's just a fact that it's happening. And that whole thing going down I think was a way for them to just cover it all up or remove and erase any people that knew about it. You know what I'm saying? That's the way it spells out to me, pretty obvious because it's documented, it's all documented that weapons were being moved. And if you look at, um, arsenal weapons manufacturing in Bulgaria. So de Leon had guts and shy by who I had on my podcast, the conspiracy. Right. She was the Bulgarian reporter that got fired for it. Now you had a podcast? He has called the conspiracy farm. Oh, okay. Yeah. Oh, I'm going to Google it. We don't, we don't start the conspiracies. We just add the water, but I've got to click the name. Yeah. My cohost Jeffrey Wilson. He's a really bright guy. Cool. Cool name.

Speaker 1:          03:17          Yeah. So we have fun with tee shirts. Can I wear it? Conspiracy theory that was going to bring you on and why he couldn't ship me one. So I will, I will. Okay. Yes. So it's a bar. It's a barn with a CT Fletcher. It's a barn with a satellite and the satellite dish down next to the bar. Oh, that's hilarious. That's it. Are you doing it out of Iowa? Oh yeah. Perfect. Yeah, it's pretty, yeah, that's right. But, um, arsenal weapons manufacturing, she exposed, the Isis fighters took here. I took her to their weapons caches and there was massive amounts of artillery rounds, depleted uranium stuff, a small arms stuff, and it was all arsenal weapons, Bulgarian weapons. Right? And she got fired for exposing it. Now at the same time, silk way airlines, who is a Azerbaijani airline, they're manifests, got exposed by Bulgaria and anonymous with manifest of all the white phosphorous weapons, the depleted uranium, our artillery rounds, all these shipments, massive shipments going into Turkey, going into Libya, going into the Ukraine, right?

Speaker 1:          04:18          We're a bunch of shit was going down there. And every one of those places who showed up, the broker, the deals, John Mccain, Whoa, John Mccain, right? And look, we can't prove it, but there's people telling me that potentially there's an offshore company that owns a big percentage of arsenal weapons manufacturing in bull. Right? So that's the kind of stuff I'm going in. I'm into who's who's causing it? Why are they causing it? The truth. I'm just a truth seeker. Right, right. Would you seem like that kind of guy? For sure. Do don't you think that that stuff is exposed at a level that's never been possible before because of the Internet? Yeah. Yeah. And that these people are probably used to operating in a certain way that they've been doing for decades and now they're having to adjust. Yeah. Well, and, and people like you just doing these podcasts and talking about it, which opens the minds of other people and has them thinking about it.

Speaker 1:          05:11          We, you know, w w who are the people screaming the most of the, I wasn't, uh, I wasn't even a Trump supporter. Right. I'm a rand Paul Guy. You got to fucking Rand Paul Shirt on right there. Ron Paul Guy. You've got to teach him, take down defense off of a lawn. A lawn mower. Right. So you got blindsided in his defense, right? Yeah. But yeah, I was that about this neighborhood tack. Those neighbors alluded tech. Right. Good Times. You know, but it's a risky thing to do live right next to a guy and attack them like you're a fucking burning the bridge. I don't know what kind of sentence that guy got though. I don't, I haven't kept up on that, but that was given sentence. Yet during the presidential run, I was given speeches for Rand Paul, a couple of them to introduce him. So I give a speech, then bring him out and I got to know him a little bit better in Iowa.

Speaker 1:          05:55          Yeah. Yeah. Amazing Dude. We had great conversations. Big Fan of his dad. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, but the people that are yelling the most now about Trump and all the other stuff, you wonder what they're guilty of, right. The deep state is just, it is a way of doing business right there. Smash and grab. There's pay to play, smash and grab his, me as somebody who is very powerful in government, going after an industry, crushing, it ruined that stock. And then my buddies by the company, right when the stock collapses and then bringing it back up like the Gi bill for a University of Memphis, we go after it. No longer will there be any GI bill money put toward that. The stock goes from 100 down to $3 Obama's buddy goes in and buys it. Then they go, wow, we're going to allow GI money to go back into it. Now. Stock goes back up. Right. That's the kind of shit that's going on. It's, it's some bad stuff and we just do our best to follow it. Educate people. And we have a lot of people to say you're, you're not, you're wearing a tin foil hat. Well, you just talking about Jamie, about, uh, something that you'd seen about politicians being exempt from insider trading rules.

Speaker 2:          07:03          Someone on Twitter. I couldn't, I'll find the name later, but, uh, if this guy, he told me about this guy, his name's Peter Schweizer. He's a Stanford

Speaker 1:          07:11          per secret empire. So that's the book. That's the book you want to, he wrote Clinton cash also.

Speaker 2:          07:16          Yeah. There was another book that he hit me up about. Yeah. But this is the one they had.

Speaker 1:          07:20          Have you had him on your show? You have no, that's a guy that I've been here. I would love to have them on how the American political class a hides corruption and enriches family and friends. Yeah. Without a doubt. There's that Shit's real. Yeah. Without a doubt. That shit's going on. I mean, look, we were just talking about this recently, about how half of what it is to be president and is to get yourself into a position where after you're out, you can make these crazy speeches for these bankers. Like why is that? Like, I mean it's, it's almost like a man. I tell you, there was a time when a good friend of mine who was an agent for me at the time got me involved because of all the years in MMA and martial arts, I've met people from all over the world who had eventually moved in the piece up positions of power in government or cities or this or that.

Speaker 1:          08:04          And so they said, we want you to help us get our foot in the door to sell waste to energy projects. So it was basically a facility that bonds anything garbage. I mean, you can burn tires in the thing at low oxygen levels. So the emissions are very low, but that generates electricity, right? And in Europe it was everybody from the city province, uh, that country and the European Union. Everybody wanted a piece of the projects. Right? That's just the way they do business in Europe and South America and other places like that. They have to have a different model for it here for the corruption. Right. They just do things differently here and that's just the way it is. They've made adjustments and either way they're going to find their way around it. Yeah. The idea that there's no corruption is ridiculous, right? No one thinks that.

Speaker 1:          08:50          So it's how much corruption is there and how how many people were out there exposing it and their neck out there to expose it. That's a big part of the problem because if you really know about it, that means you're probably entrenched in the system too. And the cognitive dissonance of the, the citizenry of knowing that Hillary Clinton and a few other people sold, you know, the document just came out. It was 15 million kilograms, 15 mil million kilograms of depleted uranium. Yellow cake, right. Sold to the Russians. At what point in any part of a discussion on any planet, is it okay to sell your enemy 15 million kilograms of frigging uranium? What was the justification behind it? Dev, they agreed that this is a fact and this is, it's a fatty greed. I mean there's this, is there any dispute that this is a fact? No, there is no, there's no they, but they sit there and use the excuse.

Speaker 1:          09:45          Well, there was eight other people that had to sign off on this. Right? What does that mean? Right. But suddenly that company, suddenly that company invests $145 million in the, in the Clinton Foundation. Yeah. That's a big problem. That Clinton Foundation is fucking insane. And all these people that were blind supporters of Hillary that didn't look at that like, how do you not, how do you not find a giant problem with that? Right. And that book by Schweitzer talks about it, he goes in detail about that stuff. Yeah. I'm sure. How's his sobriety? I'm surprised that that's what that was just going to say. He's not going after the Russians do it. Clinton cash was bad enough. This one's even worse. I'm surprised he's not dead. I wonder how many people are actually reading it. You know, it, I just, I feel like they think that there's always going to be a certain amount of that stuff out there and they just tolerate it and they just, as long as it's not really fucking up their business cause it's not, the politicians are still allowing it.

Speaker 1:          10:35          Law enforcement still allowing it and no one's really going after them. It makes you wonder like if Hillary had actually gotten into the White House and she faces the same scrutiny that Trump is facing right now over the Russian pros, we know none of this would be uncovered had she won. Right, right, right. Know that right. Yeah. All of this stuff would have been swept under the rug most likely and all this stuff with McCabe and uh, uh, struck and page and call me and all these people of going out of their way to try and derail Trump to get these FYSA court frigging spawn surveillance, frigging warrants to spy on a president elect and then a sitting president. Are you kidding me? At what point is our people not, not charged with treason for that? Right. When they were recent, they were doing this spine before he ever won the presidency.

Speaker 1:          11:25          Don't you think that if he was doing something wrong with the Russians, they would have frigging made it mainstream news and and bustled him for it? Yeah, there's for sure some dummies in his staff that made some inappropriate meetings and had some, I mean they definitely had some intentions. Well, but they had something on him. The way I look at it as this, I mean if you win the presidency, I'm going to send whoever is underneath me. If I'm the president, we have to have meetings with diplomats from other countries to make the transition. That's, that's part of the, that's part of the deal, right? It really is. That goes on. That's just the way it is. But that's not what they're talking about. They're talking about before the presidency. They're talking about having meetings with Russians long before, right, where they had planned this whole thing out. Look, they got enough. They're all dirty. They got nothing. They got nothing. I mean like if they had something new, it would be out there. It's that projection and diversion and everything else, because you know, the Podesta is, we're doing lobbying for the biggest friggin Russian bank in the world, right? Right. In Washington DC that it never comes up.
