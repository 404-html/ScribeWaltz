Speaker 1:          00:00          How many people told me, hey, I, we'd been hanging out with George for a week. I got fat again. 10,000 my, yeah, that's George, man, that's George. Don't, don't eat like he eats. You won't, it won't work. And he has his whole theories and philosophies all about why he's lean. It's like, dude, no, you're just, you're just born this way. You, he just doesn't get it. I've tried it. I've trained thousands of people. Okay. He's trained himself like he thinks the way he did what he did is we're going to work for everyone. I love Georgia, Super Intelligent Guy, but I tell him towards the way, like, he's very gifted when it comes to food and he does a lot of things. And like now he's doing it a lot of fasting and he's getting even leaner, but it'll be a long time for Georgia's fat. You see, there's, there's, there's various body types.

Speaker 1:          00:35          You know, you do have ectomorph, Mesomorph, endomorph and we're, we're, uh, we're on the continuum of these three. Georges on the Ectomorph side and in a, in a strong sign of ectomorph is a small waist. And George has a Mesomorph. No, Mesomorph is cause he's very muscular. He is, I would say you'd be more active, more Schwab. Muzzles sorry, go ahead. George was very skinny and scrawny when he was young, so he went crazy on the weights. He turned his weakness into a strength. He, that's so much weight, weight training and exercise because he wanted to bulk up. So he's a bulk ectomorph now. He's not a perfect that Kumar, he's not a 100% up to more, I would say it's between Ectomorph Mesomorph but endomorph the other end of the spectrum. You eat a little bit of carbohydrates to get fat. You lift a little bit of muscles, your muscles explode in size.

Speaker 1:          01:21          George wasn't like that. George is on a bit on the other side of the spectrum. So a real mesomorph would be like Melvin Manhoef. Uh, yeah, like that, you know, I think I'm kind of, no, no, no, no. That's more, uh, uh, endomorph. Endomorph it's fat. Yeah, but you could also be very muscular and more, yeah, you can be very muscular. I thought into morph is like, like people that have a really hard time not being overweight. You can gain fat and muscle really quickly as an endomorph. Yeah, but ectomorphs from what I've read, I might be wrong. Neither one of us are biologists. Exactly, exactly. I always thought ectomorph was really skinny and morph was they'd tend to lean towards being overweight and then Meza more. For someone who's like really like a Francis and Ghana, not super or Brock Lesnar like super muscular fic like just look like they like naturally would pack a lot of moms.

Speaker 1:          02:11          I'm sure you could pull up a chart if you can. All these pictures just show both of them from what I, from what I've read, see them as amorphous kind of in the middle. ECTOMORPH is Ilene and hot pack on muscle. ECTOMORPHIC skinny, dark and Mesomorph. Looks like you super jacked and endomorph looks like, well endomorph endomorph does not look fat in that picture. It doesn't have to be fat. That's the thing. Now here, here's, let me tell you something ladies. When you look at those three pictures, I go with endomorph all day. Exactly. Those three pictures. We love the other words, if that's what an endomorph is, let's take the in the morning. Yeah, because marks, they need a lot of naps and they're always tired. And those mesomorph their egos. Goodness, they want to choke you. The mesomorph shoulders want to fucking strangle you. But uh, endomorphs that's a woman.

Speaker 1:          02:57          God, you can have a riff endomorph anybody can be ripped. That's the guy's an endomorph. Maybe think about it in the morph is like a short, stocky hulk. Should be fat. And he could also be packed with muscle. Calvin, Kelvin, guest alum, Kevin Gasoline. And he would, I would put them on the end of the moves and the more site, yes, definitely. Because he's never really, totally ripped. Well, dolce when he had him and he was getting them down to a real one 70, he, he really had, I'm pretty ripped at one point in time. Just really low body. You can get ripped. It's just not as easy to get there. Anybody can get ripped. Um, but uh, an Ectomorph so think about a basketball player. Okay. What are the signs they say is small waist? The waist and shoulders are quite similar. Now George has a v going, you know, is very broad shoulders, which is great.

Speaker 1:          03:44          He's perfectly built for fighting that allows him for reach and his Aa cause he's got incredible, like, it's like he's wearing shoulder pads almost. And you know, he's blessed with many, many, uh, uh, genetic gifts for fighting, no doubt about it. And endomorphs are naturally predisposed, excuse me. ECTOMORPHS are naturally predisposed to endurance sports. So you'll see a lot of marathon runners or whatnot. They're tall and lanky. They're not short, bulky, uh, you know, Mike Tyson type look athletes, that's a real Meza. More real. That's what I would say. Endomorph endomorph because he's so short, short and stocky and bulky. He could put on a lot of muscle, a lot of fat Nasco. Is he a little bit, I don't wanna I don't want to say he's fat. He's, he's put on some fat since he's retired or whatnot. Right. I don't know how much it works out anymore, you know?

Speaker 1:          04:27          Exactly. But an Ectomorph, even when they stop working out, they're still, they're less likely to put back on fat. And I have a little belly, you know, but it's not as as pronounced. It's not as pronounced as an Endomorph, nm mournful pack on fat and muscle real quickly and they're, they're more, they're more, um, they gravitate more towards power sports so they can explode, but they have less cardio. Where's the ECTOMORPH is like, you'll see a lot of running backs. There's short, stocky, endomorph man, they have to explode for three, four seconds. Is there a best body for fighting or is there a, do you just adapt your style to whatever body you had? Exactly. I think there's the best body for basketball, the best body for football. While it depends on what position you're playing, but fighting, everybody has an a fight in their DNA.

Speaker 1:          05:12          So all styles, excuse me, all body types can fight and that's what's so amazing. You got it. You got to Paul Harris. He's an endomorph man, but he found a way to fight that make sense for him. That's what I always tell people. You got to fight according to your, your body type. And people think that's crazy. No Muhammad Ali fought a certain way because it has certain attributes. He had certain, he had certain uh, a certain personality. Even your personalities were important. If he tried to fight like Tyson, it would backfire. If Tyson tried to fight like Muhammad Ali, it would backfire. I think everybody has to start with the basics. And then after three, four years of training, even maybe up to five years now you've got to specialize for what your temperament is. What's your body type is, what's your personality is because not everybody wants to get it done and run.

Speaker 1:          05:57          And not everybody is the type of person is going to take it to the cards. And not everybody has a reach and speed to jab in and out. Lucky and think, oh, I'm just going to jab in and out like I'll eat. Dude, do you have the attributes that Ali has? He was born with certain attributes and everybody's born with an attribute for fighting. In my opinion, everybody got this far because they can fight. Nobody got here, uh, this far without having some innate ability to fight, you know, to defend themselves. So all our body types can defend themselves, but you have to discover what works best for that body type. Right. Tyson's a perfect example of exactly. They thought you couldn't make it in the pools. It's, I know he's going to get killed in the pros. Right? There's never been a short guy. When when Ali was dancing around, people are like, no, that's not going to work. He's going to get tired when he goes to the heavyweights. Heavyweight shouldn't bounce around, and at least to spar a lot with lightweights, he sparse six rounds with light weights, then six rounds with a heavyweight. Why? Because he would play tag with a lightweight. It just about speed and movement. You move twice as much with a lightweight.
