Speaker 1:          00:00          To Watch out about the scientist because, because he said no, the NASA plan, when he found out what it was, what is, it's a breakaway civilization where you don't try to run the whole planet. You Siphon off resources and build a whole new advanced system and then you play or body off against each other and collapse it. So when I say, what is an Assa if we could take NASA back over, it's bigger than the CIA. It's the real government, the space ships and the stuff that's all PR. NASA is the real government. NASA, there were two breakaway governments to shadow governments and Brad talked about Saturn Garber 20 years ago. So it's in, it's in the documents and so you had one that was British run and the Germans came to the, our own us elite and said, hey, you always need a couple of plants.

Speaker 1:          00:48          They said, we've got all this on the drawing board, the EU, a plan to poison the food water to get rid of the dumb people, a plan for Offworld basis. We've got, by the way, we're taking hardcore drugs and we're in contact with aliens. How has it given us tech? It was the Germans first got in touch. Well, how'd they do it? They were really a cult bridge, right? Yeah. Really into the culture. That's what all the Indiana, which is a shit around him at all times. So human sacrifices. Oh Shit. Yeah. The real society. What I am telling you, Joe, this is not me. You go to the real deep phd level history books. Okay. NASA is the German breakaway government. Just always the Germans, the Brits fighting for dominance. So what you're saying is when operation paperclip acquired all those Nazi scientists, they essentially started running NASA.

Speaker 1:          01:34          So Nasa became like almost like an offshoot of the German government. This offshoot government. Yeah. The Germans had piled all the wealth away. They had everything. So they make, does that make sense though? That in 2019 that's still going on? No, no, no, no. The British intelligence doesn't run the CIA today. The British empire was under attack and just bankrupted itself. And World War wine. It said, we'll give you the keys of the kingdom. Churchill wrote three books. Uh, the, the history of the English speaking peoples, he was half American and this is officially in books. We merged with the British empire and like 1930 covertly. Okay. That's what the CFR is. British intelligence that US intelligence. So the u s runs the show. Okay, so you've got, you've got, but German intelligence came to Eisenhower and say, listen, you don't need to do all this.

Speaker 1:          02:26          You, we haven't given them the real technology. We're in contact with aliens and they've never the whole plan, where are you getting this from the stadium so confidently it's in the literature man. Hitler like would go literature, mainline historical books about answering this assess castles where they go, the aliens want blood. So they'd killed like 20 kids and everything's aliens would like come in and he'll kill, they taking the blood brings him in like sharks and then they will not give them technology. They go, this is how it works. You build the atomic weapons this way. He built it and they would like show him bombers and like the aliens are like telepathic. I don't even believe this. This is what the nausea believed. And the and the aliens with MindMeld and give them the technology. They're bad aliens so they are you surprised the Nazis were influenced by demons?

Speaker 1:          03:08          Know if demons are real. Definitely think they'd be on the side of the Nazis. But Joe, what I'm telling you, if the aliens media, no media is going to attack this. I'm giving you want to know where I can read it? Where can I read that? Those statements because they were in contact with the aliens. Obviously your pockets, Brill Society, the Ar Group, a chick [inaudible] right up there with them, like doing ritual for three hours. If acting fly here with a report the day before, I'll send it all to you with mainline books. I'll see. I'll mail the books with the tabs in them. Okay. And I'll mail documents. Okay, cool. Yeah, I'd love listen. I think that they are absolutely obsessed with the occult. That's been pretty well documented. They made flying saucers and I think, yeah, and I think many, many governments, they developed a more advanced form of nuclear fuel, heavy water, and we had to shit in special forces on suicide missions back when was really special for us is to blow it up.

Speaker 1:          04:05          And I'm telling you, the Germans had all sorts of advanced shit. They just couldn't ever keep the plants from getting blown up because they were a few years behind. Yeah. And by the late, uh, Churchill wrote about this in his memoirs and said the Germans were way ahead. It wasn't, the Germans were bad that there's not such a bad, but it wasn't that, it wasn't the Germans that first bomb civilian targets. In 1941, the Brits were losing the war. Hitler was bombing their for their medical facilities and military facilities and, and so they went and bombed German towns and German shit. He's like, uh, I was the famous German city Dresden. What was the designated a safe city for kids. Half a million people died in one night to trick Hitler to turn his bombers on the general population. Then they tricked him psychologically to do it. But, but, but, but Churchill, this has been declassified.

Speaker 1:          05:00          It's, it's, it's an esoteric books. It's admitted. So Hitler was set up. Well, there was bad. But here's what happened. Albert Speer was he as chief armaments and architects administered at British trouble. Agent Rudolf Hess was the deputy fuhrer. They got Hitler totally love you. Never hear about him since 1941 cause they had a peace treaty with Edward the eighth, who was the king of England, who was a Nazi and who was German parish family, German. And they had a deal to stage the attack. The French stood down. Vichy French didn't fight. They put, they put Nazi occupiers in the Dunkirk operation was allowed to evacuate. Edward the eighth was supposed to then sue for peace through Neville Chamberlain. But it's come out that it was all set up by Churchill and others. Not that they ran Hitler. They weren't bad. They were pretty good. But they master manipulated him.

Speaker 1:          05:52          And it never Chamberlain all of them and bet on the British people in America to come in. They had deals with, uh, with, uh, with, uh, Roosevelt to then bring us into the war. And that was the whole master plan. And you can actually go to the history and see all that. And that's what's so incredible, Joe, when you, when you, when you have all this info and so Rudolph Hash in 1941 42, he flies a one man bomber. He was a world war one fighter. Aish like the number three, eight, like a hot 107 aircraft. Look it up. Rudolph ash, he flies in, parachutes into the castle. The king was in at the time and like northern England, I forget the name of it. He parachutes in with the peace treaty shine by the King of England. They lock him up in the tower for the rest of his life in London.

Speaker 2:          06:44          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:44          And Edward, the aide had to advocate type in Edward d a Hitler and you'll see him in videos or films and photos. He was in Spain and World War II started. Where do you think the contact with the aliens came from? Where, when did that start? All right. This was the most important thing. We're not aliens. Hold on. Hold on. Inner Dimensional Aliens, alien. It means anything. Not of this world. What, when was, when did that happen? That I sketched that motherfucking fod code blues. It's fake. I need to hear about aliens, the guard, but I don't smoke marijuana. Uh, yeah, that's marijuana. You know what's crazy about aliens? Is it a youtube made a big announcement that they're going to go after at nine 11 videos. Anything. I Dunno if this is true, I don't know. But is it true that they're demonetizing any videos that have truth or liberty in them?

Speaker 1:          07:38          Is that true? Yes, that's true. But I heard that, well, that sounds crazy interesting. Hold on, let me finish. Let me finish real quick. Uh, it's crazy how they're going after nine 11. Miracle Cure flatter and five, they're blowing up alien videos. They're blown on life. It's wonderful. Strongest hold on. A ties videos out there. I Dunno. But none of it's true. It's true. Monetize. It is. Wow. There's a lot of videos out there than the best deals at the top. Top of the line sponsored. No, I'll tell you when Eddie's right. I actually know the numbers. The blowing up alien videos was a little kid who makes $22 million a year reviewing toys. No, no. That's like the number one. Isn't he like one of the number one guys on Youtube? It's like eight I'm saying alien videos get monetized by fun. High level sponsors. The high level one because they're not, they're not offensive.

Speaker 1:          08:34          People get drawn into them. Herman's Corinas up. Why didn't they shut? Not shut down? Because they're talking about that the government is lying and covering it. Me because it's funny, but it is. How did the connection with aliens start? You said this is the most important thing you'd discussed on the podcast and any I, I love you to death if you're awesome. That's why I asked for you to be here. If you want to believe in aliens, I'm cool with that. I still love you. I don't care. I don't care about that. Listen, I'm, this is not what I believe. Okay? I love you for who you ought to do. I'm trying to tell you something. Listen man, let me tell you, Shawn, let me tell you something. Okay? I'm not making this stuff up. I believe you believe it. No, I mean the stuff I told you earlier about my dad to the table being offered half $1 million in 1980 [inaudible] that build cyborgs and the marijuana.

Speaker 1:          09:20          He wasn't here for that part. Okay. He came in later. But tell me how the connection with aliens cuts started with who connection aliens and a notch when people started becoming obsessed with contact with the aliens. Yeah, he was saying in 1947 rounds we'll have some sort of a connection. You know Eddie's right. They flood youtube and mainstream media, like they always thought it was safe. I thought about the private Federal Reserve that he wold order if I went on some big show, as long as they mix the aliens in with it. And I was never the alien guy. Right. I've never been the big alien. He never years ago with you and you know what I, that's right. I remember when I was balls deep in aliens cause I believed all that shit. I believe it used to be that you'd be a conspiracy theorist if you believe that aliens, but amount anymore. But now if you believe in aliens.
