Speaker 1:          00:00          Her low freak bitches and before that, you know, you just go back a few more people and they were grunting. Yeah. I mean they, they, they hadn't even figured out how to write things down. They, you know, or even, you know, what's, what's even crazier to think about is how we've taken airplanes and perfected that. And the last 50 years, you know, before that it was, you know, you didn't, you couldn't just get on an airplane and be anywhere in the world in 24 hours. Oh yeah. It's a total units. Parents 1903 you want to hear the craziest fucking statistics. Emer okay. Between the time that plane was invented, the, between the invention of the airplane and someone dropping an atomic bomb out of the airplane, it was less than 50 years. Yeah. That's crazy. What we do to each other. I know it was like somewhere like 44 years or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:49          Between the invention of the airplane by the Wright brothers, the first flight and then a bomb dropping on Hiroshima. Yeah. And then now there's fast and furious eight and they got bombs segues plug there. It was good. Well you should go publicist, just totally unrelated. Just thought of that. How many of those have you done? No, this is the first one that I've done. This is the first one. Yeah, this is the eighth. This will be the eighth one. And they're going to do 10 right? So they're doing a back to back because I went there, done. I didn't, that's the plan. Uh, you know I'm not, I'm not a, you know, I'm sure van and vin diesel and the producers have, you know, the, the plan set. But I mean that's the whispers. I hear that we do a couple more. Um, I think 10 would be cool. He made it this far. Might as well go to 10 right now. Can you tell us, does your character survive? Can you give us a spoiler alert?

Speaker 1:          01:42          I saw the movie, you can tell us that you're not obvious if you didn't have to sign anything. It was, it was good last night. I mean Scott had a big role. I was, it was cool cause I didn't know, you know, you never know. Like didn't, didn't ask, didn't anything. But yeah, he's all over it the whole time. So it was cool. He did. He got a job. Let's just say it's a good one then everyone will like it or you also car God. Do you like muscle cross? I'm a classic car guy. Um, I like classics. I love the old sixties. A Ferrari between a Ferrari and for that whole rivalry back then. So the GTS exactly. Yeah, exactly. I'm actually getting, uh, getting the opportunity to purchase uh, one of the new GTS, uh, coming out in 2017. Really do that thing looks insane.

Speaker 1:          02:27          Insane. And they're making only a hundred this year. Punch our cunts a hundred. I was so excited about it. Why would you make 107 billion people? You didn't make a hundred cars, asshole collectibles. So I mean, how much they charge for those for 100 bucks. Rough for a hundred of them are, I mean, I think the price is about three, three 50, $350,000. It's a collective. Sure. This fucking thing. It's, it's a beast. Look at that thing. Know it's the new one. Sanity. Yeah. Configurator can can fit. Why are they letting you configure it if you can't even fucking buy it? Just a bunch of teases forward. What are you doing that, first of all, that doesn't even look like a Ford. I mean that looks, that looks like a Ford on planet Mars. It's pretty much changing the code that lets you know, like a Ferrari. Jamie's can crap.

Speaker 1:          03:15          It looks better than a Ferrari. I think. You know, that's, that's bad ass car. Let me see the, see if she got some other angles on it. Is there any other angles? Look at that. Pretty like the hood. Oh my gosh. Oh. Cammo on that Ridge reaper option. Look at that. Fucking God. Oh my God. What a beast. I think I might get one to actually, wow. Go for it, dude. Go for it. Of just my ram, my whole life of salary, but that's $350,000 but meanwhile, the way they're making cars today, that thing's got to be insane there. But that'll be like a piece of art that that will be, you know, like the, the GTE knowing the older gts that have gone up in value because they just don't, it's hard to say that. What about new cars though? So much plastic and stuff.

Speaker 1:          04:08          They just don't seem to, people don't want them, you know, like if you get up 1960s car, it's worth a shit load of money today. But in the 1990s client worth shit. You know what I mean? It's like there's no classics from 1990 it was a couple of porches, like nine, nine six fours from the nineties or nine nine three is the last of the air cooled cars. They're still worth some money there. They're classics. But that's kind of it. Like maybe a few classic Ferrari's from that day, but like a Camaro from 1990 yeah. Push that thing off a cliff and shoot at it while it's on its way down. Hey, don't let your girl drive that car. Oh, she got issues. We were saying before, she ain't, she crashes things a little bit. History of a long history. Let's leave it at that. Hey listen, people can't be great at everything.

Speaker 1:          04:56          You know. That's true. Yeah. Good. Yeah. So now they just pointed to the side. And what about like fight scenes? Do you have to do fight scenes? Like especially you have martial arts background, should have you do scenes. Yeah, I didn't do the, there wasn't a terrible amount of, uh, a fight slammed, slammed against the wall. I could see I get slapped around a little bit in this one, but a sure, you know, in, in other films, I love doing that stuff. That's the fun stuff. Especially, you know, cause cause you get to hang with those, the, you know, some of the coolest guys on sets, all the, all the stunt guys, you know, they're all, you know, likeminded people, all, you know, martial art background guys. Um, and so you're just choreographing all day working that out. And then you get on set and you're doing it or you're, you're, you're, you're doing it with them because they might be planning the, you know, villa number seven or something, you know, something.

Speaker 1:          05:48          So then you're, you've already sort of got a shorthand with them and your that's, that's the fun stuff. That's cool. It's way better than dealing with like a difficult actor or something. Do you ever do that? Yeah. Who's the worst? Oh, come on. Make it make their name or something else. Doesn't make their name. Ryan, let's, you know, uh, you'll, you'll get me in trouble like guys. Oh, that's right. Oh yeah. That's why here I thought it was torpedoes, but nope. Might just be lips and loose lips yet in the scene, uh, the rock picks him up, like in slams and holds them against the wall and the dam. My royal was that real. It's real.

Speaker 1:          06:34          It's real with some assistance. There's some movie magic, but he's, he's a big guy. I mean, it's real. You would have dropped him and choked him out. Dot. Dude. So jacked. He took a photo of him after workout the other day and I'm like, yeah, he's huge. So discipline to 4:00 AM like, man does he is when you're on set with him, was he just always doing that? Like what's his deal? He's just extremely disciplined guy. Um, you know, I got a lot of respect for him. He's uh, he's, he knows what he wants and he is going to get it. Like he's not there is no, no, he is taking it down. He's making movie after movie after movie. He's going to go do it. He's uh, you know, he eats religiously. He's got these meals are towns, you know, which is, I love doing a meal prep stuff cause it's great. Makes his life one less thing to think about. Right. Um, but he's very religious with it.

Speaker 1:          07:26          Look at that piece of meat. He's more jack now than he's ever been in his life. I think he's 44, 44 46 or something. Yeah. And just crazy reject. Yeah. Continuing to get more and more. Jack still still putting in the work. He's not done getting jacked. He's, he's keeping pumping it. He's keeping it going. It's just a, when you see his schedule and his workload and then there's always some new projects is doing all this doing a TV show and he's doing it. No, fuck does he have time? And he's hosting this award show and he's like doing something for the troops and then he's doing this movie and finishing up that movie. He's like, how I tell you the travel is what kills me. I know you probably, you've been in show business for all longer than all of us, you know. Um, and uh, the travel is what kills you, right?

Speaker 1:          08:10          He's not the fate of the furious April 14th. That's when it comes out this Friday or vin diesel and the rocket odds in this photo, I can't tell. It seems like there was, hey, that piece, that patients that I read or was that real? Yeah. And it's all, it's all just don't believe it. Don't put anything on the Internet. Some real issues to two alphas collided on the set and Mindy's wouldn't take off the sunglasses even at night. It was so strange. Fucking dope cars though, man, dude. So he took off his necklace. I pay attention to that. What kind of cars they have in this episode. Oh, that's not a charger with the flared fenders. Yeah. You got like sort of supercharge their charge. I that sucker was on display somewhere, right? That charger isn't on display somewhere. It might've been. I mean it's, it's one of the hero cars in the phone.

Speaker 1:          09:00          Fucking insane car. Oh my God. That's pretty sexy, right? Yeah. Those, those American cars from the late sixties early seventies so you just, you just can't get anything like that sexy. Yeah. God amazing. Yeah. That one's got a custom grill to look at that grill on that soccer. Whoa. No Ram Truck, Huh? No, no. Cam's a fan of the ram trucks. It's okay. I liked drugs. Sex sells. Yeah, I do too. But they just don't, there's something about, you know, you can't get a ram truck with supercharger popping out of the hood like that. Oh sure. Big whole blowing look, they're fighting. Oh No, that's Jason Day then. Nevermind. Oh Jason say those fighting who rock something. That's, I don't think that's the rock. The rocket was brown. Well, he's the peritoneum. Xbox. He's got baby oil on and Jason stayed on. I would, I would help to pull them aside and go, hey Ron. Yeah, look at me. Look at me. Run. Run the other way. But he, he's fight, right? Yeah. He's got a martial arts background for sure. Yeah. Yeah. That was Jason's Day. Them can fight for sure, but, uh, still run. Hey, look at that rocks. Fucking, we'll get that answer. Pastor Jesus. Cool features on that guy. Young Clint Eastwood. You, hey, how dare you do that? High cheek bones. A handsome fella. I don't understand why he's so upset. Angry out of the Hollywood guys are angry.
