Speaker 1:          00:00          Is, it's almost like communities, you know, is is you have your, your, your thoughts. I've got my thoughts and we're part of two separate communities. Right. And it's just like with anything else, he, I think that integration between the two and that balance is like the most key to everybody really. It kind of will grow everybody, you know, the, the, the bounty hunters can learn something from the Vegan is just much the vegans can learn from the bounty hunters, you know what I'm saying? I think so too. You know, and I think that really the problem is when people don't want to hear the other side and they want to shout people down, they don't, they're not willing to listen. And there's, there's common ground across the board and some of it, it probably is just learned, I think a lot about like how you grew up.

Speaker 1:          00:42          And I think it's important to like understand that, like I said, just to go back to my childhood, it is just, that's the way I grew up and that's what I understood. But when I look at like my dad, you know, like my, my dad didn't have his dad so, and he was out the house by 15 you know, he and I try and put myself there sometimes being a 15 year old kid that didn't have a place to go. Like what are you going to do? And the only people you see around you is, is drug dealers and in and on us. So like a lot of it I give credit to him for sticking around for me because I would have no people over top of the head, you know? You know what I mean? And that's why people do it because those people that are doing that are just like you and me.

Speaker 1:          01:27          Everybody's like you said, we're all just human beings and we very genetically and we vary, but we very more buyer environment, how much love we get. Yeah, yeah. That's it. That's a big part of it is like it's just the culture is, it's just, you know, and I think it stems from one culture being separated from others and not having that integration. Then you get that like even more of a disconnect. And then once you get the even bigger than, you know, it's, it's all like downhill, more insecurity, which leads to more tribalism and it's, the whole thing is just, it's so disappointing that people still operate like this. But I think people were opening up to that more now than before. I just think it's a slow process. Slowly but surely, slowly but surely we still working at it. You know, we were talking before about the Rosa parks picture out there.

Speaker 1:          02:15          That wasn't that long ago, man. No, no, no. It really wasn't. And, and, and that'd be the thing with certain, there's certain white people too that just be like, all right, just get over it already. And it's like, come on, like it, they didn't have to get over it. Exactly. It is, they experience it then you don't, you truly don't understand. Uh, and you don't even like take the time to try and understand their tribal to, they'd talked to other people that say the same shit and like, yeah. Well, and they'll just start rattling off the statistics about the instances of crime in the black community and how the agents don't do this, but the blacks do. It's like it's fucking cultural. If you don't think it's cultural, you haven't been enough around enough people and it does not go back. A lot of generations, like you said, the course is not very long ago.

Speaker 1:          02:59          You know, my dad didn't have his dad, he didn't have that person to teach him what not to do and what to do. You know, it's, it's, that's a, that's a, that's a hard road, especially for a young, like you go back earlier, like young guys get delusional real quick, you know, they feel invincible. He felt like, oh, I can do this and I'm never going to get caught. You don't have that voice of reason to tell you right from wrong when you, when you that kind of age and it's because he didn't have his dad. And then while I didn't have his dad because he didn't have his dad, you know what I mean? That only goes back two or three generations.

Speaker 2:          03:30          Crazy. As you're talking about 1865 is when slavery was abolished. So we're talking about a small amount of time in human history where there haven't been slaved. So all your isolation when you, you felt as a kid where you felt separate from the people that were in the miles that were higher than yours. Think about that. Times a hundred is if you were a slave and maybe a million remedial insurmountable gap between a slave that has no chance of ever not being a slave. And someone who can go to school wherever they want and travel abroad and do whatever the fuck they want. And then the idea that some of these white people think that these people should just get over it with the amount of time is so fucking short. You're talking about we just had black panther, the lifestyle, we just had it beat Avatar. It's beating.

Speaker 1:          04:19          Yeah. I mean one of the number one biggest movies of all time. Stupid big. That should help, believe it or not, I really think it would help. It was a beautiful movie and it was a beautiful movie to describe. Even like when you say 1865 I feel like we so disconnected from even that, and this is, I've talked to a lot of people about this, the difference between being called a black American and African American. You know, I don't, I hate being called an African American. I just, that's what everybody says. But we know and it's just taped it to me. It, it makes you seem, because you put me in Francis' next to each other, Frances and an African American, you know what I mean? He's, he's from Africa. He has ties to African. Who else is in African-american? Elon Musk. Yeah. I mean, yeah, really when you are ill, but I think even more now it Kinda like, I just, why can't we be, the black comes in so many different shades, you know what I mean? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          05:17          And as this African obviously, yeah. So maybe black Americans a better way to put it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:22          But Africans have ties to Africa, you know what I'm saying? Like black Americans, slavery, like we feel, I feel we should have our ties in America. Like I should be proud to just be an American, not be called that

Speaker 2:          05:32          African American we call it, you know. Well it's with every generation. It's going to take a long time before we just abandon all this nonsense and just treat people based on who they are as a human being. But my grandparents came from Italy and they were treated like dog shit. And my grandfather always talked about the racism that he encountered when he came over from Italy to America. And they didn't think of Italians as white people. Now they think of Italians is white people. 100% yeah. And the Mexicans are experiencing that. Like, you know, if you're from Spain, you're basically white. Like nobody thinks of a guy from Spain as being like, you don't think of in the same way you think of Mexicans, right? Yeah. But one day all that shit will go away. One day we'll get past this, whether it's who knows how many generations it will take.

Speaker 2:          06:19          But I think it's changing now because of the Internet. I think there's, yeah, there's, there's definitely like more hate groups that the consolidate and they get together and they, they, they, you know, they, they live in an echo chamber online. They talk, you know, and they agree with each other. You see it on Twitter and Twitter's trying to stop that. And maybe that's misguided because maybe it strengthens it, but I think that ultimately is the ability to exchange information. Is it going to allow more and more people to compare notes and, and, and understand that there's no, there's no benefit to describe or to, to, to thinking of people as being inferior or superior or better or worse. We're just all different, but we're all human. We're all just humans

Speaker 1:          06:59          of all the same. I mean, really, you see that when you, when you see people, you know, you can really see somebody that you really know him. You really see him. He's like, yeah, it is. We literally all the same,

Speaker 2:          07:10          but all different too, because that's one of the beautiful things is that you do, you see these little different aspects of individual's personalities, but to lump people in a group, Oh, you know, you're a Chinese guy. Oh, I know what the fuck you are. You're this. Oh, you're an African guy on know what the fuck you are. You're this. No, that's nonsense. There's a broad spectrum in each and every classification, but at the, at the end of the day, we're all the same thing because we're all just people.

Speaker 1:          07:34          Yeah. Waa. Waa. Waa. Hundred percent. I mean, yeah, it's just when you talk about heaven, like pride in, in, in it, I feel like helps a little bit more of a, if I identify with like as a black American, you know, instead of, instead of like an African American, it's just, see what you're saying. You know what I mean? I feel like it's a little more, you know, I just looked different, you know what I mean? Like I bought my, I'm more integrated and it would give me more pride to beat it. Right. You know what I'm saying? And, and I think that steel, you were obviously all the same in, in there needs to be integration but you still have to have some type of identity. You know what I'm saying? I know what you're saying. Yeah. I mean, and I think that the movie in itself did a good job.

Speaker 1:          08:15          Uh, I don't know. I just went back to black pot, Black Panther. I think it did a great job in describing like the differences, there are differences between the black community at in the African and African Community, you know what I mean? Or African Africa itself in, in it because you get that, you get that like anger, you know what I mean? Like that's like the stereotype is like the bite angry black man. Right. But some of it stems from not no one where you're from and not having that core identity. Right. And I feel like we can just do that again here in America as black America is instead of Idaho.

Speaker 2:          08:53          Yeah. I hope what represents is a, it's a meter to register that racism is dying. Yeah. And that, that this is, this is also people in, there's a lot of like why people that were going way out of their way to go see it because they wanted to show everybody that they're not racist. But I think that's good too. Yeah. Ultimately it's, it's showing that this is something that people recognize as a stupid problem and we should get past it.

Speaker 1:          09:20          It took God damn long enough. I mean, what, we're probably going to be telling this to our grandchildren and they're still going to be experiencing some of it and then there's going to be something new comes out and you're like, God, daily, we just now doing this. Like, you know, that's the way it going to be. Uh, but for me personally, you know, he's just, because everybody, every kid wants to be a sober here. I'm like, oh, how are you doing? You know? So it's just like a whole lot of them. You can be half of the empire and be blade. Yeah. A, yeah. I mean, yeah, but blade was like a hit man. You know what I mean? It goes back to what you see around me. If I only see the, the, the drug dealers and the, you know, in every, you know, there was never a black superhero and it was like, all right, well shit. All right, we didn't go up there, Huh? Yeah. And it portrayed us as scientists or, you know, it was loud. I just, yeah,

Speaker 2:          10:07          white get over it guys. That doesn't register for you. Cause they're all white. Every fucking superhero. Batman, spider man. Even the Hawk is white. Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:15          First. Yeah. And I mean, and I, and I, I get it from a lot of it. I mean, there's just, it's just culture. You know what I mean? And it's is not better or worse than one thing or another. You know, there, there's Hawaiian culture, there's, there's, you know, it's just culture and it just, that needs to be celebrated too, because the more you celebrate culture, the more you can integrate between

Speaker 2:          10:37          all of them. Right. And then there's the real problem with, I don't want those cultures to go away. Yeah. You know, I was in Chinatown in Boston this weekend. We went and ate dinner at two o'clock in the morning is Chinese restaurant. It's China town, right? Jamie, that place was China town. They got like fucking, uh, Alaskan king crabs in a fish tank. Like, how the fuck did you even get that here? It's still alive. All these fish on top of each other and they pull the fish out of the tank and cook it up for you. I mean, it's like they barely speak English. I mean, this is their culture and I want that to still exist too. You know what I mean? I just want them to be accepted

Speaker 1:          11:12          100%. I mean, and, and that's the beauty about it. Not think you need to keep that alive. You know, there's two different spectrums to it. There's the, there's the, the person that's just like, oh, just go ahead and get over it. Right. And there is a person that just like, okay, what you don't even have, like, they don't want even like, uh, like I did it or acknowledge your culture, you know what I mean? They just want to like just shun it or just not, you know, just put it into a closet somewhere and you know that that's almost the, it's the opposite. But it's just as bad as needs to be though.

Speaker 2:          11:42          A buddy of mine who lives on the big island about that, he's a white guy and he lives in Hawaii and he grew up in Hawaii and I said, did you experience a lot of racism against white people? He's like, no, cause I'm not a fucking asshole. And I said, that's what it is, right? He's like, yeah man. He goes, you can't be a white guy coming over here trying to push your, uh, you know, mainland culture is like, this is the fucking culture dude. He goes, if you just accept the culture the way it is out here, he goes, they're not racist. Let's see if you can get a good, you're gonna run into a few, but for the most part

Speaker 1:          12:10          you're going to run into a few everywhere you go. Because people were like, you got to go back to it. Like people are fucking idiots in every walks of it. But for the most part is always you're not as though you good. Right. It's the same way across the board and I've kind of realized that as I'm, as I'm getting older, because before I just thought, you know, we just what we are. Right. You know what I mean? I've got family members that only will ever see Detroit. They will only ever see those same blocks. They will only ever see the same people and that's just what you think it is and it's just like, oh, it's so much now there's so much, how much more and it's not that different that you think is different. It's, it's different. But you know what I'm saying? It's not, it's not alien, it's just, it's just, it's different. It's just different. It's not better, not worse.

Speaker 2:          12:55          One of the things that I really enjoyed about traveling so much with the UFC. As you got to see all these different cultures and you got to see all these different styles of life that these people live in and you know, you kind of like put it all together and you, you, it just gives you, I think this is one of the best things about traveling is that it gives you this more rounded perspective. Like if you lived in Italy, you'd be like one of these people, if this is how they live, they live like this. You know, if you lived in Dublin, you'd be like this, this is, this is their style of living.

Speaker 1:          13:24          Yeah. And it's, and it's important to acknowledge I think all those different styles until, you know, and, uh, of living. Uh, and, and, and, and I think if you really want to like cure racism in American, all that, and it's just being open about it and just talking and, you know, people understand that other people's upbringing is, and what they went through and what they do because that makes you understand it more if you try. And just shun it away or just say if you even bring up the word black or white or anything like people get, you know, you kind of see it. Sometimes people get tense and it's just like just, just, just be honest about it and just be open about it and, and that will make it go away. It's not, it's not, you know, shun it and it'll go away.

Speaker 2:          14:05          Don't want to be uncomfortable. They don't want to talk about uncomfortable shit. So if something comes up that's a, well, you know, as a black man you're like, oh, here we go. Here we go. I didn't do it. Okay. I never had a slave. Okay. You know, and you're like, oh, all right man. You just super uncomfortable with being uncovered.

Speaker 1:          14:21          Yeah. It's like a, what for you? I think that makes you that more of the ass hole there, you know, talking

Speaker 2:          14:26          to a human being. If you really want to have a conversation with them, you want to know their actual experience. Yeah. You know? And if their experience is as a Puerto Rican that came from Puerto Rico, that feels disc, a lot of Puerto Ricans feel super disconnected with the United States because they're not really United States citizens, but they are, it's like a weird thing. It's kind of like, it's not really a state, but it's, it's sorta protected by the United States. And so they're disconnected and there's like on the east coast growing up with

Speaker 1:          14:52          Puerto Ricans, there's a weird, they have a weird alienation, you know, and that's, uh, if you don't want to talk to them and you don't want to hear about that from them, that's fine, but you're just gonna miss out on that part of what life is for them. You're never going to get it. Yeah. And all the things that they bring to it and you know, the food that they bring, the onto different arts, you know what I mean? The different styles of fighting that they bring, the different dances. Like everything is about the culture you're going to miss if you trying to just, you know, shy away from it. It's martial arts is a perfect example of like all these different cultures coming together, and there's one boiling pot, you know? I mean, yeah, that's one of the most beautiful things about it. It's just, I can go over to Ireland and fight or rush at in Ireland, and it's different than going down to Brazil then fight the Brazilian, you know, or something like that. It's just sure. But it's at the core of it just still is fighting. It's just different styles of, of being able to do it. But everybody does it.
