Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. Yeah, I didn't think of it at all. That way it's out of the podcast is just fun. Yeah, just something to do for a goof. And I did it for years, like irregularly before I ever won of committing to it. But like every few weeks and then palling around in the green room, we would do in the green room and Joey Diaz would always get mad. Shut that fucking thing off. You guys were always fucking online. You're fucking around online. Shut it off. Joe Rogan. He would get mad. I'd be like, people like it. You're wasting your fucking time on the Internet. Yeah, I was relentless. That's like the biggest part of his lifetime now. His podcast is gigantic for him. Yeah. Yeah. He just did it the other night. He was so high. He fucking gave me the, he, I forgot where his studio was, so I said send me the address again. So we, since we had dress, I fucking pull up on this dark road and I go to, I go, oh he wants to suck fucking switch the studio or something cause this isn't the old one. It's like, all right, what the fuck? It's a house. I guess he's doing it in the back of his house. I fucking ring the doorbell. It's his house. He was so high. He gave me his fucking home address.

Speaker 1:          01:10          I'm texting him, I'm out the front door and see a front of the fucking streets and I walk in and he's chewing down those. What are they black start? He's got a bong going. He's had mushrooms. Least Siad is sitting there. His eyes are shut. His eyes are shut. I don't know how he sees you handle it. I don't know how he does it. Leaks. Lee can't handle it. You could look in his eyes sometimes, like I've been on the show before and when someone says something, I always feel like we're having a conversation and someone says something like, well, what do you mean by that? Yeah, and then we're having a talk, but if you say like Lee said something, I go, well what does that mean? And he was like, lock up. Like it's just way too high to have this path. He was talking about how he was like, it seems like audio is the thing of the future.

Speaker 1:          02:02          I go, what? What do you mean? He goes, well, it just seems like people, like they're always on their phones while they're on TV or they're watching a movie, they're talking on their phone or they're looking through their phone or they're listening to things while they're doing other things. Like what? I'll get you wait, you're listening to things while you're watching TV. You're Wa what? Who the fuck was playing with their phone while they're watching TV? And he's like fucking paranoid. He'll wash over him like a tidal wave of my area that we've just poor guy. Well because two, Hi Joey makes him do everything he does. Not only Joey do that, Joey's swaps edibles on them like lead, try this. It's only 50 milligrams and he'll take a 500 milligram pot and they'll put it in the wrapper of a 50 and twist it back up.

Speaker 1:          02:50          It's mild cause mild like four of them. And so it gives them enough to make you reconsider your existence in the universe while he's running. The soundboard and he doesn't fuck up. It's a good engineer. It's very good. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, I don't know if it's healthy to be around Joey all the time like that. Like he can be really danger. We'll also Joey so good to him. You know, they just have like a very, very unique relationship man. I mean that's a, that's a God damn shell, that relationship right there because Joey's like a father figure to him kind of. Yeah. And some insane way. Joey's a sweetheart as long as you're on his side. Yeah. But the worst place in the world is a guy who's against Joey. Right? Like Joey's what the worst I've seen like God, Joey have feuds with people.

Speaker 1:          03:43          Hmm. It is a horrible thing to watch. Yeah. You know, like he, cause he's so passionate about his friendship with people that when someone turns on him, like he's the, as, as loving and is friendly and is warm as he is. Like, you know how he is like when he sees you it's all hugs and you know, it calls you up because you Greg Fitzsimmons what's going on. Yeah. That's it. You guys had a good Dick. Yeah. What you're doing dog. You know, and like he loves you. I love Joey. Like, I mean, he's my family like 100% but if you turn on him, man, it's a fucking horror. I've seen him go after people. It's very, yeah, it's crazy. He's so like he's Cuban. Yeah. No. And you know, he came up, he had a really fucked up situation going on growing up his, he found his mom dead when he was 13 he was on acid.
