Speaker 1:          00:00          Have you ever read any Terence Mckenna? I know you're familiar with something called the stoned ape theory. No, sorry, not Mckenna. It was, uh, he was a, an ethnobotanist and he was also a psychedelic adventure and he had a theory. And the theory was that the, what you're talking about, this climate change, uh, that also coincided with a doubling of the human brain size. His theory was that one of the things that was in play was that these apes would experiment with different food sources as they moved into the grasslands. And there was a lot of undulates and these grasslands and it's silicide mushrooms, which we know existed back then would grow in these grasslands. And that these monkeys, these apes rather started consuming silicide mushrooms and it led them to be more creative. And it also led to specific traits like the development of language that eating mushrooms, um, in low doses increases visual acuity, which would lead them to be better hunters are more perceptive.

Speaker 1:          01:00          It also leads them to be Hornier, which would most likely involve more breeding, more sexual activity and possibly select the, the ones that chose the, the mushrooms would maybe possibly breed more than the ones that didn't choose the mushrooms because they were more into it. Then we're more social, more sexually active. And he has a series of, uh, like his brother Dennis, who's still alive, detailed it on a podcast we did the very first podcast we did in his brother is, is, is an actual scientist and detailed it in terms of how silicide and affects the brain and what areas of the brain it, what, what, what actually takes place when you're under the influence of this and that it could very potentially have led to the development of language and that this, all these things in play, the throwing arm, the, uh, you know, developing these new social networks, uh, with where you need to communicate with each other along with the harnessing of fire along with the consumption of psychedelic mushrooms on a regular basis because they were incredibly frequent and very edible.

Speaker 2:          02:15          All right, that's total trip. I've never heard of that. Fascinating. Like that's a really good example of some random thing. If it really did play that role, how random that is, that these freaking things happen to be growing there and that they happen to be attracted to them and ate them. We know that animals like to get high. I'm elephants will eat these fruit that have, well the drunk in this case it overripe and, and um, become alcoholic. We know that animals will do that.

Speaker 1:          02:38          You've seen jaguars that consumes psychedelic plants and they lie on their back and stare at the sky and there don't, no. Oh, it's amazing. But you, you know what I have? WASC is no, I wasco is a, it's a way that uh, these people in the rain forest develop untold thousands of years ago of developing an orally active version of dimethyl trip to Maine. Do you know what dimethyltryptamine dimethyltryptamine is the most potent psychedelic known to man. It's incredibly potent drug that is just intensely hallucinatory gives you these insane visions and it also is pre, here's the Jaguar. It's really crazy. And this is in the Amazon. These jaguars eat these plants and these plants, uh, are they, they have the ingredients of Iowasca and these jaguars are known to eat these things and then trip they're fucking balls off. They eat them and there are pupils dilate and they roll over on their back and stare at the sky.

Speaker 1:          03:37          I mean, they're clearly high, right? So this is something that you're going to say. Yeah, this is one of my say. So this is what Iowasca is, is dimethyltryptamine like, look, it's kind of cool watching this Jaguar trip balls. They just stare. They see shit that's not there. I mean, or it is there. Maybe there's some still traveling. It's amazing. So what Iowasca is, is w there's dimethyltryptamine, which is this incredibly potent psychedelic drug is produced in the human body. It's produced by the liver. It's produced by the lungs. And they also believe it's produced by the pineal gland, which is literally your third eye. The pineal gland in certain reptiles actually has a rep retina in a lens. I mean, it's like an eyeball. And they think, and the Egyptians called it the seat of the soul. And they think that this is one of the reasons why they're, they have this obsession with this gland in eastern mysticism is somehow or another, they figured out that this is the gland that produces this incredibly potent psychedelic truck.

Speaker 1:          04:37          This psychedelic drug dimethyltryptamine also exists in thousands of different plants. The problem is when you consume it orally, your body produces something in your gut called model Amy and oxidase and monoamine oxidase breaks it down. So what these indigenous people figured out is how to combine one plant, which contains this psychedelic compound with another plant, which contains a natural Mao inhibitor called harming. So they brew this all together, much like they did with the cassava, which we have no, no idea how they figured that out. They brew this stuff up together and they create this psychedelic t called IOWASCA and Iowasca. Now they have all these trips where people go down to Peru and take this stuff and trip the fucking balls off. And this, uh, this, the combination of these things, um, leads to this incredibly potent trench, really transformative experience, which is impossible to describe. And that this, this a psychedelic drug. Why, why didn't I bring that up? What was what we were talking about how maybe chimps in are these early ancestors did something similar, which pushed them along this path and starting to communicate, how do I get to DM tail? W W how did I get to Ios Guy? There were a couple of links in that chain. Maybe it was because of animals that get high. That's that. That's what it was. So this is what this, that's exactly what it was. It was, yeah. The Jaguar getting high

Speaker 2:          05:58          on Dmt, that's what they think the Jaguar is doing. Just the Jaguar consuming this stuff. He's, it's making them trip on DMT in DMTs. I mean, it's fun. It's really exciting and variance. So Robert Trevors is, is wonderful biologist who started a lot of the kinds of work that we're talking about going in the 70s calls these sorts of things. A phenotypic intelligence, right? So evolution gave you these pleasure centers in your brain so that you do what's in your genes, best interests, and kill the animal or get the girl or whatever. And that makes you feel good. And so we tend to like the things that are good for us and dislike the things that are bad for us. We don't want any feces we do on eat a steak, right? So there's cases like this where it short circuits that it goes right to the pleasure center, even though what it's doing, it's kind of irrelevant. But this is a case where maybe it wasn't irrelevant, maybe it actually caused these animals to then change the way that they behave to become more sociable. Right. It's very possible. Something like that played a role along the way, which is why if you replay the sequence, the vanishing rainforest 10 times, only one time does it maybe lead to anything good. And the other nine times it leads to a bunch of dead chimps. Yeah. Well the, the process was probably incredibly slow, right? Over millions of years. The climate did alter.
