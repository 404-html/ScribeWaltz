Speaker 1:          00:00          So back to Anderson though. Yeah, so my book ends with him are that first leave and fight and then shattering his leg, which I was in the front row for which you didn't even believe it. If it didn't make sense to see a leg move like that, you're like, I don't, I don't get it. It looked like somebody filled up a sock with, with pebbles and just like look at something and it's like it doesn't, it didn't make sense and it was so gross. But in the interim, seeing that first Chelsea on and fight when he was, I mean he won 400 half rounds checks on it. He almost won the title. And then to kit that, I mean it was such a legendary sports thing, not UFC, but sports thing. How this guy's down like crazy in a title fight. A guy who's never been tested was finally tested and was losing.

Speaker 1:          00:50          It was over. This guy could, Chael Sonnen was beating him. He figured him out. And then to get that triangle with what, 40 seconds left, two minutes left over. It was, but I remember what's so clear and indelible in my head is afterwards we're at the entrance, everyone's cleared out of the stadium. We're at the entrance to the, um, to the, under the, you know, the caves of the, of the stadium, wherever it was. And it's me, you, I think Dana, uh, Randy was there and we're all talking. And then every once in a while somebody's mind would go to that fight and you'd just see him go like, yeah, yeah, I think the weather's pretty nice here. And then you see someone go like, like, you couldn't believe it. I remember seeing Randy couture, dude. Like, I'm like, why do this?

Speaker 2:          01:36          Four minutes into the fight grabs a hold of it or four rounds in the fight, grabs a hold of it, syncs up the triangle and gets a triangle armbar combination and taps him. Wow. And this is an Anderson came into that fight, injured and her Anderson had a fucked up rib entering into that fight. And a lot of people thought he should have pulled out. What kind of weird edit is this role? The blurriness all. He's strange fan and it was nuts. It was nuts for that guy. He'll come and see how he's holding his side and the moat, the first, that was the first trash talk fight ever remember to Oh, Chels son and people forget how good he was talking. Shit. He was the best, the best. He was the best. When I come in, when Anderson Silva walks into the ring, you could hear a mouse piston on cotton. When I walk in, it's thunder. I mean, the problems he would cut. Yeah, we're just the APP that hadn't been done yet. Now. Not a lot. Well, Conor Mcgregor Prob, you know, it's arguable. The chill was even better than Conor, but if you take time period into accounts, no one was doing right. He was the first and he was building up fights as a heel for the first time ever. [inaudible] and brought them in a little bit later.
