Speaker 1:          00:00          Let's, let's be clear, the Anti Vaccine Lobby owns the Internet right now. What does that mean? What that means is they've got, they've put out now by some estimates, 500 anti-vaccine websites. So that every time you put the word vaccine into a search engine, whether it's Yahoo or Google, you're going to get anti-vaccine misinformation. That's number one. Second, we know now it's amplified, um, social media like Facebook or other forms of social media. So a third, um, you know, look at the Amazon site. I mean, it's, it's incredible. So my book, this book, the good news is, it's, I think it's, right now it's the highest rate of pro vaccine book on Amazon. The bad news is overall it's ranked about 20, because there's 19 other phony baloney anti-vaccine books. So that's the, Amazon is the biggest purveyor now of anti-vaccine books. And wait, it gets even worse.

Speaker 1:          00:55          Then you also have, now they've become politicized. They have political action committees and multiple states lobbying state legislators about, uh, um, fault with plying them with false information about what vacs vaccines do. So, and, and the problem is we don't have a robust system of pro vaccine advocacy to counter it. So we don't really hear as much as we need to from the federal government, from the CDC, from the surgeon general. So unfortunately in this country, that defensive vaccines false to a handful of academics like myself, you know, I'm an academic, I wrote a book. What, what chance do I stand against this major, uh, media empire. Why do you think that exists? Why do you think there is this major media empire that's against vaccines? That's a great question. What's the motive? What's the motivation, number one, and number two, where's the money coming from?

Speaker 1:          01:51          Right, right. There's real money behind this is millions of dollars behind this to put out phony documentaries and phony books. What's a good phone he documentary to point to? Well, I'm a little reluctant to do it. Say it because they're so litigious and, and uh, and you know, I don't have the means to defend a lawsuit and things like that. So these documentaries, I usually don't mean specific aims are, I understand these documentaries. What do you think their motivation is? Do you think they earnestly believe that vaccines do cause harm or vaccines do cards? I autism. I don't know. I mean is there some kind of other agenda that they have? I mean we do know in some cases that um, the some elements of the anti vaccine lobby or promoting phony autism therapies, right? They're doing terrible things like this thing called MMS, which are bleach and amongst whites.

Speaker 1:          02:47          Yeah. Bleach, giving bleach enemas to catch you couldn't to children the children bleach, bleach because they're cleansing the immune system. A cleansing them of toxin though it's really awful stuff. And they're doing culation therapy, which is very dangerous. What is that? That's where they, they claim, you know, kids are overdosed with toxic metals, so they give a chemical that actually can collate the metal, but it can kill it, your calcium and then put you into a fatal Arrhythmia as well. They're also who is doing this culation therapy. You can Google it. It's a or whatever search engine or these doctors like suns, some cases there are doctors unfortunately or other health professionals. And what is, I mean, I'm sure you've studied evidence late. It gets worse. There's no evidence. And then, and then they're doing hyperbaric therapy, which is really bad. So insomnia, hyperbaric therapy is bad.

Speaker 1:          03:37          Well for, it doesn't do anything for autism, that's for sure. But it's, it's good for recovering from injuries and yeah, there's certain selected sir. But who knows what, who knows what it's doing to a young kid, right? I mean, so, so you shouldn't be doing that. Um, the then the other then that's one. So how much of this is being driven by, um, financial motivation peddling these phony autism therapies? I can't say. My sense is that's not the big piece of this. There's also some reports now Russian bots and trolls that are amplifying this and sewing political instability in the country. But again, you add that all up the phony autism therapies, the Russian bots and trolls, to my mind, that really doesn't get our arms around the big driver of this thing. So I think we really need some good investigative journalist to look into this.

Speaker 1:          04:27          Well do you think that there's something sort of a concerted effort or do you think that it's just a bunch of people that really believe that vaccines do cause autism? They don't truly understand the science and they haven't talked to someone like you and maybe they have this idea that cemented in their mind and they're not willing to look at it objectively and look at the full spectrum of possibilities and look at the science behind what you guys are saying. Because in their head they've been saying vaccines cause autism. They've been saying it for so long that once someone gets that and they're connected to that, it's very difficult for them to shift gears. V People have a really hard time not being married to an idea. Yeah, no I agree that and um, you know, when I talk and I spend a lot of time going around the country giving, uh, what are called grand rounds lectures to hospitals and medical schools, pediatric grand rounds.

Speaker 1:          05:16          So I've had the chance to talk to a lot of pediatricians and nurses and nurse practitioner even and more and more than a few parents. My impression is most of the parents are who are, who are called to be so called vaccine hesitant as the word of the day are not really deeply dug in. I mean, you can, you can have a conversation with them and explained to them like we're talking now in a very, you know, nontechnical way, you know, the evidence showing vaccines don't cause autism and the lack of plausibility given, uh, that it, that it begins in pregnancy and they'll vaccinate their kids. There is another percentage, and I don't know what the percentage is, whether it's 10 15 that are deeply dug in and are wholly invested in this conspiracy theory that the, that the government is in cahoots with the pharmaceutical companies and Blahdy, blahdy Blah.

Speaker 1:          06:08          And then if you try to talk them out of it, they just think you're part of the conspiracy. So it's, it's sort of a no win approach there, but, but most parents, you can have a good conversation with most parents. Um, it's not necessarily even most parents, right? I mean, what, what you're dealing with is these people that maybe they're into a bunch of different alternate therapies, a bunch of different kinds of cleansing. And you know, there's a lot of that nonsense that you find online where, I mean, look, there's legitimate, but I, but I guess, but I guess my point, I'm sorry. That's okay. Please go ahead now. But I guess my point is, um, parents don't get the chance because they're so inundated with phony anti-vaccine information that they do a Google search or whatever, you know, whatever search they do. So what do you think should be done?

Speaker 1:          06:54          Should there be a pro vaccine documentary? That makes sense. I think, thanks for that question. I think there's three things that need to be done. I think first of all, some of this anti-vaccine media empire needs to be dismantled, dismantled, dismantled, and that, again, whether they're wrong or right, like shouldn't, I mean, it seems like there should be some sort of a debate, right? Like if there's someone who's saying that there's some evidence of vaccines caused debates, you're saying there's no evidence of vaccines caused debate. Uh, excuse me, that vaccines cause autism. And you're saying there's no evidence that vaccines cause autism. There should be a debate where there some sort of a like some sort of a monitored conversation where you can have you versus someone else and break this down. Yeah. But that, that has, that's a two edge sword too because you know, then it gives some false legitimacy to the anti anti-vaccine side.

Speaker 1:          07:47          It's like debating the smoking caused cancer. Yeah. But doesn't that, isn't there already a problem? I mean it seems like if there's this many, if you do Google search and you're just overwhelmed with anti, it seems like the fight has already been lost. If that's the case. That's right. So giving them legitimacy looks like it's not necessarily giving them a legitimacy. It's giving them, you give you rather a forum to dismiss their legitimacy. Yeah. I mean, I think, you know, part of it, what has to be done is, I mean, and, and this gets into all sorts of First Amendment issues and I'm not a lawyer, but you know, the, the idea that Amazon now is putting out all of these phony books and, and phony documentaries or they're just a distributor, right? They don't have to go over every book that they sell with a fine tooth, but maybe they should, I mean, not fine tooth comb, but maybe there should be some screening.

Speaker 1:          08:35          Maybe Amazon may be Facebook should all be hiring chief scientific officers to, you know, putting some stops on the dissemination of, of information because it's harming children. Right? I mean, this is the reason I get passionate about it. Um, the reason I actually wrote the book because it's kind of interesting, I it actually before all of these big measles outbreaks that we've been having. Yeah, I noticed that in Texas there was, where I, my laboratory is at Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine, we noticed that there was a steep increase in the number of kids whose parents are opting them out of getting vaccinated to the point where in Texas we have over 60 almost 60,000 kids not getting their vaccines in the state of Texas. And those are the ones we know about. We don't know anything about the 325,000 homeschooled kids. So we probably have over a hundred thousand kids not getting vaccinated, all because of this misinformation campaign.

Speaker 1:          09:30          And I was really troubled by the fact that there was no response to it and that drove me to write the book. So the point is now Texas is very vulnerable to measles outbreaks. And I say measles more than the others because that's the most highly contagious disease. What are the danger of a child getting measles? So is there any benefit to a child getting measles in terms of their immune system? No, there's no benefit. And that's one of the phony books they put out called Melanie's marvelous measles. I mean it's, it's awful. So, um, uh, what did they say in that book? They say build your immune system. It does not. It does not. It's remember, um, after, so let's go back a little bit. Smallpox was eradicated in the late 1970s through vaccination. One, smallpox was eradicated. Radica measles was arguably the single leading killer of children globally.

Speaker 1:          10:19          2.6 million children died every year. And measles because it causes measles, pneumonia, measles and cephalitis talk about permanent neurologic injury. That's a bad actor. Measles, uh, and then deafness at all. And then through global vaccination campaigns, we brought it down by the year 2000 to about half a million kids dying. And then the gates foundation put up $750 million to create the Gavi alliance to global lines for vaccines and immunization. We've brought it down now to 100,000, but now measles is coming back. Europe's a disaster right now. We've got 80,000 measles cases in 2018 in Europe and now it's coming back to the u s and so my worry is this meet the anti-vaccine media empire isn't it started out as a fringe group, but now it's really effecting public health, allowing a deadly disease like measles to come back. Do you think if there's some sort of definitive evidence that shows to the general public like you could, you could show it to them like this is what causes autism.

Speaker 1:          11:19          We've narrowed it down to these genes and it, it has nothing to do with vaccines. If you give these vaccines to people without these genes, there is no way they're going to get autism. They get autism specifically because of these variations in their change. You just, you just summarize the book, but I mean we need more than a book, right? It does disturb me when I hear about all these kids getting measles and, and not just measles, but it means in some places polio has made a resurgence, you know? Well, polio in know we're down to about three, three countries that still have transmission, a wild type polio. It's Nigeria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, so hopefully we're getting our arms around polio. But measles is now come back, roaring back with a vengeance. Having people contracted polio outside of those areas. I mean those are the areas where it's calm every now and then.

Speaker 1:          12:08          Some cases pop up. We had some in wherever and this could get it onto a whole nother topic. Wherever there's collapse in health systems, infrastructure such as during two from war, political instability, these diseases can come back, they can come back. And the people that are vulnerable, the children that are not immunized. That's right. And when you're immunized, you're not vulnerable. That's right. Yeah. This is, it's a really confusing thing for people because on the outside they w people always want to think that big Pharma, but I've, I've said some terrible things about big Pharma and the reason being is painkillers because painkillers and antidepressants and there's the Ssri is which are over prescribed and the painkiller one kills me because I have no people directly that have been addicted to these goddamn things and the doctors are passing them out like candy. So people look at big Pharma as being, oh, these are the monsters that push this.

Speaker 1:          12:59          They're also the people that give you things that save people's lives. There's a lot going on there. I'm, I'm no big defender of, uh, of the big pharmaceutical companies. I mean, one of the things that the anti vaccs the insults at anti-vaxxers hurled at me as they say, I'm a shill for industry. They say I'm a secretly taking money from Merck and Glaxo Smith Kline. It's all crap. I don't take a penny from them. And I, and I, and it's not even how do you get paid just by the, from the university, they get paid by the university. And some of that, uh, some of my salary's offset by not grants from nonprofit foundations. Um, then, uh, this is like the national tropical diseases, right? And then they say, I'm secretly making millions of dollars for our vaccines for hookworm and schistosomiasis and chagas disease with all that money.

Speaker 1:          13:46          Because my wife says, if only that were the case, right? These are diseases of the poorest of the poor. I'll never make a penny on these disease. And in fact, you know, one of the frustrations I have with the big pharmaceutical companies is we've gotten a lot, made a lot of progress of their vaccines. We've gone all the way from discovery through early phase process development and manufacturing an I and d filing with the FDA investigational new drug applications. But we're in and kind of stuck at phase one, phase two clinical trials because we don't have the big Pharma money to take us all the way to licensure. So I've had a lot of meetings with the big pharmaceutical companies to see if they can partner with us. And so far that hasn't happened. So is has there ever been any discussion or any interest in creating some sort of a, a compelling documentary that's pro vaccination that can counter all of these things?

Speaker 1:          14:35          Cause there's, there's quite a few health related documentaries that I know are horse shit because I've talked to actual real scientists and clinical researchers that say like all these things they're saying are wrong and this is why they're wrong in this. You could show this the wrong. And then when someone, Hey, I saw this documentary, it says it, all you should eat is toast. They could say, listen man, you've got to go here and watch this, and it'll show you why. That's nonsense. Right. Is there anything like that right now or was there any discussion? Not right now. There are some discussions, but we're a long way off from that and the problem is the anti-vaccine documentaries are being distributed, widely distributed, widely sold, and and those people that are talking about it. Here's the other problem. Whenever I talk to someone about it was I've been doing this a lot lately where I've talked to some of the about something.

Speaker 1:          15:21          They're passionate about it. I go, what books have you read on it? And it's like, wow, I saw this documentary. Well, very, and there are, in fact, there's 19 I bullshit, 19 ahead of mine write books that are written by actual researchers, people that have spent decades in labs understanding what's going on. You don't really, you know, you don't get a lot of that from the people that are anti anything. Right. Well, that's, that's what I wrote, the new book. It's a very confusing thing for parents because you're scared. You know, you have this little tiny baby that you love more than anything in this world. And then the doctor say, Hey, we've got this round of vaccines common and you're just terrified that you're going to do something to your child is going to turn your child into a someone who's compromised. Yeah. And, and the point is, um, problem is these diseases her back now and so they're, the urgency to vaccinate is now more than ever.

Speaker 1:          16:14          I mean remember right now, look what's going on in Vancouver, Washington right now where the measles outbreak is underway. The ones who, who are at greatest risk, our infants under the age of 12 months, not yet old enough to get their vaccine. So that if you're a parent right now living in Vancouver, Washington, you're terrified. You're terrified about taking your baby out the Walmart or cause they break that vaccine cause they're, that we'll never get the right. So now the disease is coming back because the older kids are catching it and the entity and the anti vaccine lobby uses terms like personal liberties and medical freedom. Well where the personal liberties of this parent now who's terrified to take her in when you say his or her infant anti vaccine lobby? No, I know that Robert Kennedy Jr is a, he's a, he's a big one.

Speaker 1:          16:59          He's a big one and he seems like a very intelligent guy. How could he not be aware of the science behind this and what is he getting wrong? What he's getting wrong is just about everything. Um, you know, he's formed an organization called children's health defense and um, and it start, he had a press conference about it, I think it was September, October of last year. It is probably one of the best organized anti-vaccine groups out there now he's doing other things other than vaccines. He's doing a lot of things about environmental health and things like that. I don't know any part of that business. I've only followed what the, what he does with vaccines. But it's all, it's all nonsense. Why is he doing this about vaccine? It's don't know what's his book? I mean, you have to ask him what, what's his motivation? He be a guy that you would want to have a debate with or have a discussion with.

Speaker 1:          17:45          But again, I mean, I'm uncomfortable with the idea of a debate because it's like, it's like debating, I dunno, it's like debating our Holocaust denier whether the Holocaust exists. I mean, not that this rise, I understand what you're saying, but if you're, again, I want to bring this up. If you're, you're complaining, there's 19 books ahead of yours that are anti vaccine books. You've already lost the battle. Like it's time to regroup and maybe regrouping would be confronting someone with actual scientific information mean you are a real doctor. You're a guy who actually studies this and you're a man who understands the science. You're legitimate academic. You could, you could actually put a dent in this with a real conversation. Yeah, potentially. Potentially. Yeah. I mean, what would he be able to say? Like what is his take on it? Well, remember he's a, he's an attorney and he's a, he's very clever.

Speaker 1:          18:34          Right? And now he knows how to presumably knows how to do arguments in court. And what am I am a scientist. Do you think that he wants to deceive people or do you think that maybe he's just incorrect his accumulation of data? Yeah. I can't say what his motivation is, but, um, his, uh, his, his information is, is highly misleading. Hmm. Now, what else is he, when you say the lobby, is this an organized thing? Good question. Again, we need somebody who really wants to do a deep dive in this and kind of dissect out the pieces to understand. Um, but it's, it's impressive what you've got out there in terms of the hundreds of websites and the amplification on social media and everything else. Is it, are there just one or two or three groups behind it or is it a random collection of organizations that that needs to be looked at.
