Speaker 1:          00:00          Her low freak bitches. Um, speaking of mushrooms is, this is something that I get wrong all the time. It's one of the other things I wanted to ask you. What, what is, um, there's some very close relationship that mushrooms have and the absorption of mushrooms have to DMT. What, what is the chemical differentiation? Okay. Very, very slight actually. Um, the temptation to start drawing structures is almost irresistible. Write some stuff down. Go ahead. I'll draw awesome. Here. Do we have a visual? No, we don't, but I'll save that piece of paper. Okay. Well, uh, I don't want to get too far into it, but basically, okay, so you've had organic chemistry. Yeah, no, no. Okay. Well then this spam organic chemistry. You are, you are organic chemistry. Well, this may be a useless thing, but it the, here we go. We could see it up on the wall here.

Speaker 1:          01:02          We've got it up on the screen. Oh, there you go. Oh, okay. Well there you go. Yeah, we don't have to draw struck. You could look at it right here so you don't have to turn around and look to your right. Dennis. Turn and look test. Okay, so right. So you can see if you've, so there's Serotonin, silicon and dimethyl trip to me. Wow. You can see that silicon and die muffled trip to me and I were very close in structure. The only difference is that hydroxy group, that Oh h group, that's the only difference. So Allison is exactly the same thing as an end dimethyltryptamine that's correct. Why single trivial difference is what makes silicon orally active and dimethyltryptamine is not. Wow. Wow. Because what's going on with that? This the static diagram, eh, different molecular model would show up. Well what's going on the is that that nitrogen there in when sums and physiological solution, the nitrogen is charged, has a positive charge.

Speaker 1:          02:06          They oxygen, it doesn't have the h there. It has some negative charge. So the nitrogen curls back and is in close association with the oxygen. If this makes any sense, the enzyme can't get to it. That's why it's orally active because essentially it can't get to that nitrogen. What that enzyme does is cleave off that nitrogen model a mean oxidase. It takes away that nitrogen and it can't do it with awesome. So that's why cellSens orally active. It doesn't require an they mail inhibitor. It's just in some ways it's the perfect psychedelic because you know, no preparation needed. You'll just bend over and pick the mushroom. They'll preparation is required, which is probably why very ancient man knew about suicide cyber, and they couldn't, they couldn't not have if they were living in an environment where it was found
