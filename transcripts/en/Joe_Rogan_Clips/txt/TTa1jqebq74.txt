Speaker 1:          00:00          Suge knight gear May, you know what else in my body does? If I'm in a room and I'm supposed to be awake, you ever get like sleepy? Sometimes if I get sleepy, my Dick would get hard. It's like, it's like my biggest look out around the area. Well sometimes I'll be in writers' rooms that I get sleepy and my and start getting hungry. Oh fuck. So then I'll try to go to the bathroom to throw board on my face. But now I'm slightly like a wreck getting up. So making sure nobody's looking at me right. Like some freak. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm like always in there. Always pull my shit down. But isn't that funny? Like everybody knows you get an erection. Everybody knows you get erection. Right. But if they get an erection near that, I'm like, what the fuck? I know. I know I had a boner.

Speaker 1:          00:52          Sorry. Sorry. It's human nature, but you can't, especially in mixed company. Yeah, yeah. Especially today. Nah, you can't day to day, man. Just think about all the sexual harassment that people just sort of like that was there the way they behaved. Yeah. Yeah. The office, that was their thing. And now you see now you can't do that. Why they went to the office, like they couldn't wait to get the work to chase whomever was there, pinch the secretary and a blood. Um, I mean it's, you know, my mom had a thing like that when I was a kid. I didn't understand it, but somebody was, you know, she needed the job. So what I will say to, you know, um, women watching what my mom did and she just kept elaborate notes so that cause she knew it was gonna be his word against hers.

Speaker 1:          01:40          And you know, predators don't keep notes, man. They don't keep note of it. So mom was like October 8th, Duh Duh, Duh, Duh. They, you know, she was protected and so, wow, just don't try to go off memory like that. You know, if the shit, even if you're keep notes man, still you against them. Yeah it still is. But back then boss, whoa, but still once you, cause that's how, who I think, who had somebody else had no, the Weinstein thing. Somebody kept like notes and that's why I mean, cause you, when you have a lot of money you can definitely litigate it. Like it is. I'm sue under the law. But when something like, you know, and I think his legal team looked at it, they were like, you better go to Europe for some deep counseling cause deep. However they, you know, Europe counseling, it's a different level.

Speaker 1:          02:27          That's the leave the continent. Right. Hey my head on straight. I'm gonna stay over here. Yeah, I had be able to do that. It's crazy. Well look, if you look at like the Kevin Spacey thing, like that's how he would run a set. Apparently he'd be on the set and he'd just be grabbing dicks. Yeah. That's what they're all saying. I mean, I don't know if that's the truth, but all the people in the house of cards set, this is what all the complaints are coming out was that he would like grab guys dicks that we're taking them places and he'd have like a PA that had to take him somewhere. He reached in his pants and grabbed his dick. He was just a dick. Gregory grabbed, um, whose dick was it that he grabbed like some famous dude, uh, Richard Dreyfus. He grabbed his son's Dick and with him in the room, ah, he was just a crazy dick rubber stop maniacs.

Speaker 1:          03:14          Crazy wrong. Dick grabbing off the reservation. Ah, and I think this is their social environment as well as their working environment, right? They're constantly around all these people and they're, they're in this king roll. Yay. If you're a star of a show that you're the executive producer of and it's a giant hit for Netflix and you're the king. I'm Frank Underwood, the king of House of cards and all the people rely on you for their jobs. This is one of the things they're saying about house of cards is that 2000 people could be out of a job. Exactly. Which is crazy. Yeah. So this guy was like at the epicenter, like he was the, the king of 2000 people. So he would show up at work and you know, see his ego, grab your ticket, the king, you know. And I think that is like natural male predatory behavior.

Speaker 1:          04:08          I think when a man gets into a position where he's the king and all these people [inaudible] maybe we get you something sire. Like if you're on a set and you're like the big star, all these people are stumbling around sire. Maybe, maybe we get you something sire. Like you start thinking like a king. Like if you're Harvey Weinstein, like think about all the people that cover it up for him. He had it written in his contract was crazy. I mean, but also just think of that work ethic man. Like you know what I mean? He like to work that hard. And then the part that trips me out is when people would show up to the victims ago, tell me everything we're going to, we're going to take them down. And then those people were investigators. Did they go, I work for Weinstein Bitch. Like you better not, you know how fucked up it has to have you walking around in the world.

Speaker 1:          04:54          But they're predators, man. And they look for like, you know, it's this weird shit, but it's like if you, you know, they had like a parent or something like, come on baby, do you think it's safe to, you know, meet with him at three in the morning and they were like, mama is cool. It's going to be fine. Trust me. Why don't you trust me? You know? And then when something happens, they feel like they can't say anything because they don't want the, I told you so. Or they don't want to, oh well, whatever it is. And then that, that moment can turn into two weeks and not saying a year, six month, then you living, you know what I mean? And, and so that's how it can happen when you're just so embarrassed, you know what I mean? Or you don't want to embarrass or hurt other people at times. Sometimes people don't say anything because they don't want to make their parents feel what type of way, you know? Yeah. There's a lot on a lot of women that had been rape victims that the stigma of being a rape victim, excuse me, publicly is a, it's so hard. It's so terrifying. They don't even, they'll like, I'll just let it slide. It's, and it's, it's like man, it's horrible. It's, I mean, so I'm personally, I'm happy that people are finally speaking, you know, coming out. Cause it's, it's, it's a lot of jobs open and up.

Speaker 1:          06:13          I'm really happy that people are finding that courage to just, you know, speak that truth and hope we'll see what happens on the other side of it. Will we be a healthier society? Well, I've been saying this for a while that I think that eventually we're going to get to a point we could read each other's minds. I really think that's on the, on the horizon. I think it's just a matter of time before no one can ever do anything like that ever again. And I think that's what you're seeing now with like this Harvey Weinstein Shit and the Kevin Spacey Shit and all this other stuff. I mean you see varying degrees of it. Some of them seem pretty innocuous. Like Al Franken just likes to grab butts when he takes a picture. It's like, ah, not the best practice, but not the worst thing in the world.

Speaker 1:          06:50          But I think we're going to get to a point where all of this is look back on like wearing powdered wigs or slavery or any crazy old shit that we just don't tolerate anymore and just nutty behavior that you just can't do anymore. I think we're going to get to a point where you're going to be able to talk to someone and you're going to be able to see what's going on in their head and you will, you would have to be a real piece of shit to victimize gross. I gotta stop. You know what's interesting too, I think this is a direct reaction to us not communicating with one another. You know what I mean? It's a day like today, like everything is texts like my boys at a single day, you know, they getting girls to texts, like, have you talked to her yet? Now Ryan, but she's sending me like all of this, the number.

Speaker 1:          07:38          So you're not really, yeah. And then I think can be taken out of context, what have you, but, but yeah, it is getting to the place where you're going to have to be really clear with your intentions, like American to see it. You can be OCD tension. Some people. Oh Wow. You know another thing I think that is ridiculous and I'm not pro prostitution, but I think it should be legal and I think if it was legal you would have way less of this gone. Oh yeah. Wanelo yeah. Cause that's what it is, right? It's just that release and people need to craziness. It's forbidden shit. There's a lot, there's a lot of factors going on. But I think one of the things that would change is that people that want like ugly dudes like Harvey Weinstein, it just wants sex and he could just go get it.

Speaker 1:          08:14          But I think for him it's like a power thing to definitely mean he was banging all those really hot like famous chicks. This drug dealer told me a long time ago, it was two things. He's talking about men. It says two things, man. Understand as weapon or a secret. And if you came with they ass, you better get a secret. So, and that's uh, you know, I feel like Harvey doing that shit to a lot of people because they became huge stars. There's no reason for them to ever have to respect him again. You know what I mean? But he was like, yeah, but you, you know what this is, you know, take my whatever, whatever his, well apparently he, he wouldn't negotiate it into deals. He would say, if you fuck me, you'll get more lines. You'll get parts who get this and get that. And so it's like, I mean, but that is like my main was like, so what, when do you know your worth?

Speaker 1:          09:08          Right. And when you know, well, if you, you know what I mean? I'm good. I don't need this here over here or I've already, the work I've already done like my, my last work paid for all this shit. Where are you getting your money? You're getting your money from something I did. You know what I mean? Like instead of thinking about it like, oh you can give me more money cause like you sitting on this, you got this sweet from my performance. You know what I mean? Like right. This dude wrote you didn't do shit like literally came up with this guy wrote it. This guy shot it. Yeah. Yeah you ain't, that's what's interesting. He's like, he's not the creative guy at all. No, no. Just the money guy that fucks the women. Yeah. It's weird. It's weird man. It's weird how long you got away with it for it.

Speaker 1:          09:50          For decade after decade after decade. It's, it's, it's crazy man. It's almost like the floating like every person that you look at like, Oh man, that person doesn't know. It shocked me the most about Matt Lauer. That motherfucker was making $20 million year 25 I heard it was 2,500 2028 years. 28 and they had to pay him. They had to pay him, pay him out after the last contract. They said I was just reading. They don't know if it's going to be finished. There was 2018 contract, but he also was getting flown a helicopter rides too, is like a Hamptons house so we could spend more time with his family or something in between dam outlet or meetings as to what would happen. All of them. All those cats get paid out though. What's the Charlie Rose Gate? When he had to step out, did he get paid out? But he was on PBS.

Speaker 1:          10:40          It probably wasn't getting paid. Riley got a lot of extra money. Right? Riley paid 30 $35 million in a sexual harassment settlement. What the fuck could you have possibly done? Just think about it. In fact, they're like, okay, okay, I'll give you 35 million. You shut the fuck up. Like 5 million is a j Lo House. Hold up though, Joe. This is fucked up. But that victim should be a motivational speaker that motivates. Yeah. Talk to other victims that I had to pay. First thing I did was I limped around, then I pretended I couldn't walk good. And I always get nervous. I'd have to sit down 35 I appeared vulnerable. It worked out. Yeah. Oh, that's, I mean that's wonder what he did. I mean it was just one, I mean another one, I think he paid a 12 there was like several different ones that he had to pay off.

Speaker 1:          11:31          Like this guy was on a rampage for years and years. Yeah. He's a trick man. He was on the streets. He's a trick that pays well. He's a house money. 35,000,035 come on man. And everybody already knows you're a freak. So it's like you wasted 35 million. Like everybody knows you're a freak. Yeah. And so who do we, where do you start? Like is it the platform who, who gave them the platform and that guy, you know, I think it's a bunch of things, but one of the things that I think it is is that that world is so sexually charged. All the men are like these powerful, wealthy men and all the women are hot as fuck and the off short skirts on and they're all talking about like, like American value and it's all conservative values. It's all super simple brass to right behind closed doors as button popping.

Speaker 1:          12:21          And fucking crazy snoring. I see lips, Woo. Maca being a PA, Chrissy. That's what's so puritanical. Tuto man, they don't teach, they don't teach six education like to younger kids is never cool to talk about this shit. So there's definitely that. But it's also the suppression, the ones that are like super religious, super suppressed. Those are the ones that have this date. You have a need for an outlet. Of course. Yes. Yeah. And I feel like it's, it's equal. Right? So the amount that you put out, you equally have, you know what I mean? Like that. Uh, who was that guy? The senator or congressman with the fuck it was, it just got busted like uh, having, he was an anti gay. Oh yes. And he turns out he was, he got busted having sex with a dude in his office. Yeah. Inappropriate behavior. And they called it, they had, it was very convenient and they give him the x. Here he is anti Lgbtq lawmaker resigns over gay sex scandal. Republican state, Ohio State Representative Wesley. Oh, Wesley Wesley Goodman. He may have also previously assaulted an 18 year old. Hey, hey, assaulted. Is it like Kevin Spacey type of salt? Like Dick Grabbing? No To word assault is, oh man. Words are violent. Hello? Your words are violence touch you? No, no, no. Your words are violence. Okay.
