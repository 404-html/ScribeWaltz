Speaker 1:          00:00          You're a funny guy. Yeah. But outside of that, I, I'm not lacking in confidence, but leaving my house is like I said, uh, uh, quite uh, what I'm saying is like, by whose definition is enlightenment? Because like say if you wanted to go to a concert or you wanted to go to a great movie, what an enlightened person. Enjoy a great movie. I would think my version of an enlightened person. What in fact, enjoy a great movie. I, I've been enlightened to the concert. I saw James Brown when he first got out of prison and I found that, that that performance that he gave was the most enlightened performance I'd ever seen. Was this when he was in the car chase, was that that prison? Yeah, it was the way it was the last prison he shot at cops because I believe so. Yeah. That one was someone else used his bathroom, right?

Speaker 1:          00:49          Isn't that what happened? Someone took a shit. Don't know. I know that he got in trouble with the cops, but maybe it was that, I don't know. That's a big deal. But to someone using this tool during, is that a, he had gotten out of prison and just the idea that James Brown was in prison. I think maybe I remembering this incorrectly, but I think someone used his toilet and then he got mad at that person and shot at something like either shot the wall or something. I don't remember that story, but I assume that you're looking it up right now. So we'll find out. Like he was in a high speed chase. They shot his tires out. They shut. I remember it this way. Show something in a car though maybe. I'm pretty sure they shot his tires out and he was driving around on my rims.

Speaker 1:          01:35          He had to him and doing a lot of blower or something, make him that agitated, you know what I mean? No normal human Doug. And we're talking about James Brown. Is that agitated? I mean, who gets that? And he was fucking phenomenal. When it's you. Who's young to state chase? I went up to 85 miles an hour and fall 14 cars. He said he didn't stop because he feared for his life though. I don't try to see why it started and I don't see that. I feel like that that's what started it. He was, he fired off a gun because someone used his toilet, by the way, a two stage chase. I'm guessing he lived near the border. Probably live in one of those wacky states. We live it. We live in Georgia. Oh, okay. Well maybe he's like Georgia, Florida. Yeah. It could be close to each other.

Speaker 1:          02:15          Georgia, Florida line. It's not a band. It is, right. It doesn't know. Wheeler Walker make fun of them. Failed a a Beta pullover. That's all it is, but I'm pretty sure that's why they were pulling them over. I think they were going after him. I'm, I might be wrong about that. Maybe that maybe I'm confusing him with. Okay. Chuck Berry was the one who was filming people going to the bathroom. Right. I think he, he liked to go in the piece like the PN ladies. I'm pretty sure. Interesting. I'm pretty sure, interesting, genuine. When I enjoy James Brown's music, I'm not thinking about his car. Thinking about his other side. You know your story. Oh really? Oh, here it goes. Yeah. Okay. He carrying a deadly weapon in a public gathering and attempt to flee Perise driving under the influence of drugs. Okay. He reportedly stormed into the insurance company next to his office waving a shotgun and complaining that strangers we using his bathroom as time reported is Tad.

Speaker 1:          03:16          That's it for six miles. There you go. Are you kidding me? Years later this episode would frame the 2014 j brown bio pic. Okay. 80 get on up. I'm guessing that I saw him after this cause it was right after that. It would be, it would be late eighties early nineties Jesus Christ. He did six years. Yeah, he was in there for a while. Six fucking years. How about just sober him up? He was on PCP. They gave him a year for each mile. He drove on his Mac. Rumors of a PCP habit already surfaced by the time his erratic behavior came to a head in September. Wow. Pcps a tricky, we sang in the prison choir. I bet he did. Shit. Imagine you'd go to jail for like stealing the car and you're fucking, Sally is James Brown. Like, hey buddy, what do you want to do? That's something that's a hell of a story.

Speaker 1:          04:13          Yeah. Help him write some songs, you know, get on up. Yeah. Did you ever see, um, when he opened up for, um, the Mohammed Ali fight with George Foreman documentary? Holy Shit. Was that incredible? That was incredible. Yeah. Incredible. Yeah. He had so much power. There was something about him, man. He would get on deck. It was just power. Give you an idea. How much power prince wished for that power yet? Well, prince had it, but he had another way. Never way, but prince looked up at Howard. Didn't know James Brown was ridiculous. All I looked up to it. Yeah. I don't have any musical talent. It just tells you what a waste all of this was because Elvis had that power and he didn't use it. He had it early on and then he could never dance like James Brown though. Or if he did, he never showed it. It would be different.

Speaker 1:          05:03          It's a different kind of power. If he just took an harness. Here it is. Look at this. Look at his dress too. Just looking at the fucking pants and the Shelia's. God Damn. Drop it down doing splits. I know. No, he was not human. And by the way, he, he's not even really flexible enough to do a full split and yet he's still dropping down on stage. You know, he was wearing a turtle neck that night and I said to him, cut that baby out. Let's leave a little bit. Let's put your initials on there. I think that that was done in advance. What was the girls was hanging around with James Brown. Yeah. Look at these giant ass band. I don't envy those people. Do you know when you see people with bands, Torin, all those people, all those working pieces have to fall into place. Yeah.
