Speaker 1:          00:00          Well what I'm, what I'm trying to get at was like, okay, like when things come up, like say if you find out that there's people from Isis, they're using Twitter and they are using Twitter and posting things. Like what is the conversation like how do, what do we do about this? Do we let them leave this up? Do we we recognize this as free speech? Do we only take it down if they're calling for murder or hate speech? Like what, how do you handle that?

Speaker 2:          00:27          Well, it evolves. I mean, because like we first saw isis when the world saw isis and we needed to change our policy to deal with it.

Speaker 1:          00:35          What was the, what was the initial reaction to it? So once you realized that people from Isis, we're making Twitter accounts and they were trying to recruit people and doing all these things, what was the, what was the thought?

Speaker 2:          00:45          Oh, it was a question. Like what, what are we gonna do about this? We haven't experienced this before. We need to, nobody has, I mean, you're [inaudible] pioneers. Yeah. But there, there are people who have experienced in different forms and different mediums. So we reached out to our government partners, for instance, our law enforcement partners. Uh, we reached out to our peer companies to ask if they're seeing the same things that we're seeing. Um, we have a punch of civil societies that we, uh, talk to, uh, to get their take on it as well. And we try to balance that across, um, you know, various spectrums, whether it be, uh, you know, uh, more organizations that are more focused on preventing online harassment all the way to the Aclu and the eff who are protecting the first amendment online. So we, we try to get as many perspectives as possible, take that and then make some informed decisions, but also realize that we're probably gonna make some mistakes along the way and all we can do to correct some of us just be open about where we are.

Speaker 2:          01:46          And that's probably where we failed the most in the past is we just haven't been open about our thinking process. Um, what led to particular decisions, how our terms of service evolve. A terms of service as an area in our industry is just a, it's a mess. No one reads them. You, you know, you sign up for these services and you quickly hit accept and we expect people to read these rules of the road, but they haven't read them. And have you ever read them? I have read, read Facebook's. I haven't read Facebook's Facebook. I'm not on Facebook for Facebook. Right. I'm just kidding. What about Instagram? Do you ever read theirs? I was, uh, I was in the first 10 users of Instagram. Really? Uh, Kevin was a intern. Kevin Systrom was an intern at Odeo and um, I was one of the first investors of Instagram and love the service.

Speaker 2:          02:48          I don't think I've ever read their terms of service. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Even you, even me. But I read ours and you, one of the things I noticed right away is, you know, you read our, uh, you read our terms of service and one of the first things that we put at the top of the page was copyright. And intellectual property protections. You go down and you scroll down, you see everything about violent threats and abuse and harassment and uh, safety. And it's not that the company intended for that to be the order, it just, we just added things going on. But even a read of that puts forth our point of view. Like what we're, we're actually putting copyright infringement above the safety, the physical safety of someone. So we need to relook at some of these things and how they've evolved and how they reacted and visit above just because it's listed second.

Speaker 2:          03:44          I mean they're essentially all in the same one sheet there on the one sheet when you bring it up, when you discuss it first. Is that really critical? They're all, they're all part of the terms of service. Yeah. But I think the ordering matters. Like what, what do we consider to be most important? And then we have to consider physical safety to the, to be the one thing that we protect the most. And so I to go threats, physical threats, doxxing anything that impinges on someone's physical safety. This is an area where I don't think a technology and services like ours have a focused on enough. We haven't focused on the off platform ramifications of what happens online. So what do you do? Like, like here's a good, for instance,

Speaker 1:          04:30          this situation with this, a young kid who had the Maggot hat on and the native American gentleman who was in front of him banging the drum and then people are calling for this kid's name. They want his name, they want us to address including Kathy Griffin. Like how do you, how do you handle something like that?

Speaker 2:          04:46          Well, cause that's essentially request for doxing and that's, that is a new vector that we haven't seen in mass. I this, these are, these are the cases that bring up entirely new thing. So we have to study it. We have to see how we reacted, what happened with a network. Um, but this goes back to the incentives. Like we are incentivizing this very quick reaction and it's taking away from some more, some more of the like considered work that we need to do to really diagnose what's happening in the moment. And it was, it's such an interesting case study to see how that evolved over just 48 hours. And that's one of the most fascinating new cycles or stories in the news cycle and quite a while because it's nuanced. There's, there's many different levels to it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:37          And a lot of like really knee jerk reaction.

Speaker 2:          05:39          It's totally, and, but we helped that had to help it. Well, it's just, that's how some of the dynamics of the service work. But is the nose of this things we can dynamics

Speaker 1:          05:50          of the service or is it the way people choose to use the service? Like if you're a thoughtful person, you wouldn't just like for instance, the original image that was distributed, uh, came from an account that's now banned. Right. And so it was, it was discovered that that account was a troll account. What, how does that happen and what, what was the thought process behind that? Because the image that they posted was a legitimate image. It really did happen. It wasn't, it was a part of an actual occurring event. So why did you abandon the person or the troll account that put it up?

Speaker 2:          06:26          I Dunno about this particular case, but it's likely that it was found. There's, there's a lot of what you see on the surface, the Twitter and some of the actions that we take on the surface. But where we spend a lot of our enforcement is actually what's happening underneath. So in many cases we have, um, trolls or people like the case that you mentioned whose sole purpose is just to harass or abuse or spread, uh, particular information. And oftentimes these accounts might be connected or they start one account that gets banned, they start another account. But we can actually see, um, this through a network Lens and we can actually see some of those behaviors. So that might have been one of the reasons I'm not sure in, in that particular case. But, you know, the,

Speaker 1:          07:20          how do you know, do you know because of Ip addresses? Do you know, because of the, the

Speaker 2:          07:24          Alrighty of things. Like it could be, it could be trying to use the same phone number, same email address, Ip addresses, um, device ids, all these things that we can use to, to judge what's happening with them, the context. So we do have a lot of occurrences of suspending or temporarily suspending accounts because of activities across accounts. Um, and, and that, that happens a ton. But what I mean, what I mean in the, in that we're, we're helping this right now. It's like some of the incentives, like just, just imagine seeing that unfold and when you see someone with one take, it kind of emboldens something to follow along and then this mob kind of rules. So there has to be a way for us to incentivize, uh, a lot more, more considered and more nuanced introspection of what's going on.

Speaker 1:          08:14          Yeah. Give everybody mushrooms. Probably the only way to know how are you going to get people to be more considerate? I mean, what, what do you mean writing constantly engineering social behavior, right? Yup. Provided more context.

Speaker 2:          08:27          One more context. I could an example. Let's, let's take Brexit for example. Okay. So, um, if I followed a bunch of accounts that like, like Boris Johnson who was constantly giving me information about reasons to leave, I would probably only see that perspective. Nigel Farrage yeah. And those, and those, a lot of folks just will not follow accounts that have a completely different perspective, a different influence. A number of people do. Hopefully journalists do, but most people won't do that work. So this is the only tool we give people follow an account. If, however, during that time you followed the Hashtag you followed the Hashtag vote leave 95% of the conversation and the tweets you see are all reasons to leave. But there's a small percentage that shows a different perspective and that shows a different um, a different reasoning. We don't make it easy for anyone to do that and that is a loss.

Speaker 2:          09:31          Anyone to follow perspective, follow the Hashtag follow topic, follow, follow an interest. And because of that, um, we help build an echo chamber and something that doesn't really challenge any perspective. And not to say that we should force it upon people, but we don't even make it easy for people to do in the first place though. The way you do that today, as you go to this, the explore tab, you look, you search for a Hashtag or you tap into a Hashtag and you can see all the conversation. But that's, that's work. And most people just won't do the work. They'll stay in their timeline, they'll see what they need to see. And I can certainly imagine, you know why? If I'm just following a bunch of people who have the exact same take on this, it just continues to embolden and Bowman bolden and they see nothing of a different perspective on the exact same, the exact same situation.
