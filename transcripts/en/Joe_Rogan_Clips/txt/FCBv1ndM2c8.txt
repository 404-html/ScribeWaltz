Speaker 1:          00:00          And laying up and paying attention to online for a long time. One of the things that you do a great job with is just calling bullshit on. I mean, you loved called Bullshit clearly, but whenever people are overstating claims or people get ridiculous, and I think this is one of the things that is a problem with any diet where people get really enthusiastic about it, that becomes an ideology. Whether it's the ketogenic diet or the carnivore diet or the, you know, fill in the blanks, Vegan Diet. People decide this is the end all be all, it's going to cure cancer, make you smarter to Dick's, going to grow a foot. All of these things are gonna happen and you do a great job of calling bullshit on that kind of stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:39          Yeah, I mean I, I'm not anti Quito, I'm not anti pagan. I'm anti bullshit. And one of the problems we have is nutrition is replacing religion for a lot of people. So you find something that you identify with and then people start to try to say, because they identify with that movement or like for example, vegans, they identify with many of them, uh, protection of animals. Uh, not my job to judge their ethics on that sort of thing. But then they kind of try to backtrack to find the science to support them as well. And they, they pick and choose. And this is guilty of all groups, not just vegans. This is also a lot of key digit Dick Diet cell. It's a carnivore diet, whatever have you. If it has the word diet, they're zealots out there who are going after it. And I will stick up for, I've stuck up at a scientific conference for the Ketogenic Diet.

Speaker 2:          01:30          Uh, you were, we were having a round table about something different and somebody said, well, we know that the ketogenetic diet in prayers, exercise performance and endurance athletes. And I said, I don't think that's necessarily true. Uh, you know, the, it's pretty and ambivalent. The ambiguous as to whether or not it does. It seems to be kind of individual. Um, but on the whole, on the average it doesn't seem to impair exercise performance. So it's kind of what you like. But when you have people who you know, like, like a Gary Taubes who says, well calories don't matter, it's all carbohydrates. Um, that sort of thing of the carbohydrate, insulin model, obesity, I mean the research is you're able to do a lot of hand waving about insulin and you know when you burn so much fat when you're on a high fat diet, which is true by the way, you, you burn a lot of fat.

Speaker 2:          02:16          But what they don't talk about is that it's, it's overall fat balance, how much fat you store versus how much fat you burn. And when you're on a high fat diet, you store a lot of fat, you also burn a lot of fat. The overall caloric balance is what determines whether or not you will have net storage or net deposition. And it's same thing for high carb diet as well. You know, this idea that with high insulin it just completely shuts down all fat burning everywhere. That's just not true. Now if you have high carbohydrate, you will burn less fat, but you're also storing less fat as well. And again, the net caloric balance is going to be what determines how much you store because you don't really store carbohydrates as fat for most people. They did a study, uh, overfeeding women where they overfed them 50% above their caloric maintenance and they found that of 282 grams of fat that they store during the day and Adipose, only four grams came from carbohydrate. 278 came from fat. So

Speaker 3:          03:13          Glucose. What about fructose? So fructose causes, we think, you know, non alcoholic fatty liver disease. So that could be, you know, that that's a de Novo de Novo lipogenesis is higher with fructose and you think about people consuming it in liquid drinks a hundred to 200 grams a day, which is not uncommon even for my wife, not uncommon.

Speaker 2:          03:32          So fructose does seem to have a little bit of different hepatic metabolism. But I was actually across the hall from, um, a professor who was doing a lot of the research on, on fructose and obesity and fatty liver disease. And even he came to the conclusion that if you overfeed fructose and it creates a caloric surplus and you're overfeeding for dose, then you can have some wonky stuff start to go on relative to other macros dies. Try to keep this, try to keep this right next to your face. Sorry. Got It. Because that's what she says. So powerful. I talk loud and a lot. It's good. Um, so if you're, if you're doing that, if you're creating that caloric surplus, what you find is when you're in net storage, when you're driving more, uh, nutrients into adipocytes and sometimes liver, depending on metabolism, but it takes, it takes a lot of fructose to do that.

Speaker 2:          04:24          And a caloric surplus, you start to create a lot of wacky stuff going on. Um, the Mitochondria starts to become dysfunctional. And you know, people make a big deal about, oh well you have, we have claimed now that everything causes, uh, obesity and type two diabetes for, for first it was fats, then carbohydrates, and there's actually a professors out there who actually will claim the protein gives you diabetes and it's type, can I stop you for a second? What you mean the Mitochondria becomes dysfunctional? How does the Mitochondrial, how does that happen? Okay, so I'm going to state for everybody that I'm going out in a limb. This is my opinion. Okay? Um, if you look at the research on obesity and diabetes, what happens is you have everything start to elevate in the bloodstream. So if you measure, like there was a professor who thought that branch chain amino acids were causing obesity because they were elevated in the bloodstream during, uh, or sorry, during type two diabetes.

Speaker 2:          05:19          Well, yeah, branch chain amino acids are elevated. So fatty acids, so triacylglycerides so as glucose. So is it really those things causing it or is it possible that when you are overfeeding relative to what you burn relative to that turnover, that Ma Mitochondria start to become dysfunctional? Probably a lot due to inactivity. Um, and the Mitochondria is, as we call it, the powerhouse of the cell. As you probably learned in high school biology or whatever they taught it to you as that is where everything fluxes through. So that is where you're creating ATP. That's where you're burning through lipids, carbohydrates, that sort of thing. If that becomes dysfunctional and you're not getting enough flux, enough pull through that Mitochondria, what happens is you start to back up every part of metabolism. So all the metabolic byproducts, almost all of them inhibit everything within the cell. There's a metabolomic signature for that and, and Epi phenomenon, if you want to call it that, would be elevated branch chain amino acids because the consequences of that and in some people, yeah.

Speaker 2:          06:25          So these things start these byproducts, these metabolic byproducts, because you're not fluxing enough through the cell. They start accumulating within the cell and start to inhibit the Kreb cycle. Glycolysis. And so everything starts backing up to the point where you also start inhibiting the insulin receptor. And now you have glucose, fatty acids and amino acids also backing up to the point where they start to overspill into the bloodstream. And you see these, this accumulation of all of them in the bloodstream in type two diabetes. And I actually think that again, me going out in a limb that obesity doesn't cause type two diabetes and type two diabetes doesn't cause obesity that they develop in concert from the same problem, which is overfeeding under activity. So a lot of it is about how much nutrients you're fluxing into cells versus how much energy you're creating fluxing them through the cell and out. So when you're overfeeding, whether it be carbohydrate, fat, you're fluxing more energy in than you can dispose of, and now you have to do something with it. Well when you run out of, when you do that much to it and Mitochondria start to become dysfunction, dysfunctional, you start to not have enough places to put it away and it starts spilling into the bloodstream and now you cause all kinds of problems,

Speaker 1:          07:42          problems. So one of the things that we really wanted to talk about here is high carb versus low carb. Yeah. Cause this is a just a giant point of contention today in nutrition, especially in terms of uh, athletes with performance in mind. That's a big factor. Whether or not high carb or low carb is the way to go. And there's a lot of zealots on both sides and there's a lot of bullshit and there's a lot of, you know, online experts. And one of the great thing about bringing you two guys in here is because you could really actually explain the science behind it. Now you've been great lane at pointing out that there's, it's not a magic bullet and you know, and so many people like to sort of stress it that way, that they, they, they like to portray ketogenic diet. Is this is it, this is the end all be all. I figured out what to do. This is the way everyone should be eating. You don't think so? I don't think so because if you look at the, the weight loss problem in our society, uh, and I'm, I'm writing a book called fat loss forever. I talk about this in detail. We don't have a weight loss problem. Six out of every seven people are able to lose a significant amount of body weight in their life who are obese or overweight. The problem is the weight regained statistics are absolutely terrifying.

Speaker 2:          08:56          Uh, within one year, 70%, we'll put it all back on. Within two years, it's 85%. Within three years, it's 95%. So that means diets have a 95% failure rate. And of those people, one third to two thirds will add more than they originally lost. And this gets kind of into Yoyo dieting and I talk about that as well. But the, the real problem is that people don't stick to pick something that's sustainable for them. All the research. If there's one bit of research out there that, that we have that shows how to create lasting weight loss, and you look at the people who are the 5% who actually keep it off, uh, it's that they pick something that's sustainable, whether it be key to genic, whether it be low carb, high or low fat, whatever it is, Vegan, something that they can sustain and make a lifestyle.

Speaker 2:          09:46          If, cause if you look at Meta analyses, uh, uh, for our listeners met analyses are, are kind of a study of studies. So they take, researchers take studies that have similar parameters and they kind of lumped them together and they look at, okay, what's the consensus amongst these studies? And they have advanced statistics. They used to run this. If you look at low carb versus low fat, there's no difference in adherence overall. On the whole there's no difference and there's no difference in weight loss. There's no difference in a blood lipids, even glycaemic control. So there was a study where they met analysis of, I think it was 23 studies, over 3000 people where they looked at, okay, if you control calories, so calories are acquainted, does low carb versus low fat make a difference on weight loss, glycaemic control, those sorts of things,

Speaker 3:          10:38          leave the ketogenic diet. So by definition we have an objective bio marker that defines the ketogenic diet is the only diet that actually has something that you, you know, you can measure in your blood that say you're on this diet and when your ketone levels are elevated, that confers many different benefits, uh, that I believe can enhance adherence to the Diet. Before we get into the woods here, I want to clarify one thing, the difference between someone being on a diet and being able to sustain it and not being able to stand in gaining all that weight back.

Speaker 2:          11:10          Isn't that a discipline issue? Well, partly, but we kind of had to start looking at, okay, if we, if we go in, let me read, let me re circle. We have to find what requires the least amount of discipline for somebody to stick to. Because discipline is is while some people have more, some people have less, um, it is a finite resource. So when doing only find that people like kind of drop off whatever they're doing, it's when they're stressed out, work stressing them out, they're going through a divorce, those kinds of things, right? That's where are our discipline kind of wanes because we're trying to be so disciplined for this other thing and it's draining us. So what happens with, with diet is it in people who are busy, people who have a lot of stress in their life, that's where they really start overeating.

Speaker 2:          12:03          So we have to find something that requires, I look at it is let's find something that requires the minimal amount of, of discipline for a person so that when your life goes to absolute shit, you can still stick to it. And so for some people that is a very, very individual thing. And they see this in the dietary studies that what works for one person to create a deficit and sustainable isn't the same way for another person. And Dom even commented on this about his wife Chella. Um, she does much better on a higher ratio of carbohydrates to fats.

Speaker 3:          12:35          Yeah. I mean, early on it was obvious that she wasn't going to change her diet. I, the time that we met like 10 years ago, most, we, I was really getting into this and I really felt that for me at least. Uh, but she would stop at checkers and, you know, get a burger and with the sugary drink and she's in tremendously carbon tolerance. She was very skinny as a kid. And, uh, she taught me tolerance, carbohydrate. She's very carbohydrate tolerance. Did I say intolerant? Yeah. Uh, yeah. So, and, and you know, if the Diet low carb I feel, and maybe in ketogenic putting in an under that umbrella works, I think for up to 25 to 30% of people, uh, especially at their carbohydrate intolerant. And I believe that it does that by virtue of elevating Ketones, shifting, you're a, the neuropharmacology of the brain, for example, it works through Ghrelin.

Speaker 3:          13:29          It works through, there's new science emerging right now showing that appetite regulation is influenced positively by, uh, nutritional ketosis in ways that were just starting to learn now. Well, you can certainly feel it. It's one of the things about the ketogenic diet. When you're in that state, all of a sudden you're just not hungry. The same. There's not a, an overwhelming need for food. Yeah, I'm, I haven't had anything to eat today. I mean, when I was eating massive plates of Pasta 25 years ago and I went to this, this long without food, I would start getting shaky. I would, I would have a hypoglycemic response and I'm completely resilient to that. And that has major implications for military personnel being keto adapted, not just for performance, preventing seizures. And I think for a cognitive function too. But you, uh, it's very liberating. So meal frequency is not an issue.

Speaker 3:          14:23          So if you're in austere environments where you have limited food availability, that becomes a major issue. And if you're working as a scientist and you can't, you know, you're working with animals, you're doing experiments, you don't have time to eat. I need to maintain that cognitive function. I needed to be sharp, you know, with limited. So it worked very good for me throughout my professorship. You know, getting tenure and things like that where I could just put more time and energy into my work without having to stop, prepare a meal, eat a meal, cleanup. Like I think I wasted a lot of time doing that when I was eating five to six meals a day.
