Speaker 1:          00:01          Search gear for that. Is it? Hey, what are your thoughts on net and tragedy? Because I would talking to people online today about net neutrality. Yeah. Uh, I posted something about it that it seems to me to be one of those ideological camp issues where if you are leaning right, you think that net neutrality is a bad thing, that the market should decide. If you're leaning left, you think that there's some regulation that the government should step in and be important because you want to keep people from information. You don't want to a big corporation to be able to step in and say someone can or can't have their program on 18 t or Verizon or, I think that from what I've read, there are six major service providers. Maybe, maybe a couple more that that already smelled a little bit like a monopoly. But what I think is that if you and I, first of all, nobody really knows yet, but I think that the bigger issue becomes if these companies provide you service in your area, they could decide to break it into say to bandwidth say could decide you want regular, you want regular service or do you want premium?

Speaker 1:          01:09          If you want premium we're going to pay a little more and that's one thing they could bring it up. If that's the case, we'll let the market decide. Maybe that maybe that creates an opening for another service provider to come in and say, we don't do that one price covers everything. It's one of the guys on my Instagram or my Twitter rather had a really good point. He said the real issue that people aren't talking about is the monopolies that these companies have in small areas. Like if you're in a certain town, like you can only get this kind of company or Verizon or, that's what I'm saying. When you have a company that owns a certain town and then you know, and in certain areas is the only way you can get coverage. Do you have to do with this one company, then then it becomes a real issue.

Speaker 1:          01:46          And not only is it become an issue, but the other issue is that now the real question is if you are a service provider and you provide, uh, people in this area, that service, if the other service has, if you use platforms that the other service provides and they compete directly with this, would this service block that, would this service have an incentive to uh, slow block your access to it or whatever? And that would be an issue. But my, my feeling is that we'll find out very quickly and as long as consumers have the ability to go over to another provider, as long as consumers have the ability to go, I don't like the way you do business, I want, but they don't have gotten some, a lot of areas becomes the [inaudible] have a license, they have a license in a certain, a certain district consumer backlash is how you fight that.

Speaker 1:          02:37          If there's enough consumer backlash and people go, are you just keeping it net neutrality in place and prevent it, you know? Yeah. I mean it's just I'm going to have some experts on to talk about it soon in the future. Yeah. I'm going over all the data and information, but I just wanted to get people's temperature and it's so funny how people, uh, get so aggressive and shitty with you when you just talk about this issue because a few people, I had a mute. I was like, good luck dude. Yup. Your opinion means shit to me because you just have to be insulting when someone's just asking a question. Right. You know this, this whole thing is, is interesting because there's smart people on both sides of it and they have compelling arguments on both sides of it and I don't, I don't have an opinion 100% I lead more people.

Speaker 1:          03:17          A lot of people don't yet know how this this is going to play out well because you know where we may say though, you lean towards what I lean towards the idea that you have to have some oversight, that you have to have someone who's looking out, who makes sure that these companies can't fuck you over and can't prevent you from having access to certain information. Certain sites I lean towards that most, but the answer that other, the other question is though that does the market decide that was going to say the other oversight could be, I always leaned toward the idea that the marketplace would be your oversight. Let people make their choice, but they have to have a choice. Unless you were talking about there are very few service providers. My, my question is, is there incentive for other people to come into the service providing space?

Speaker 1:          04:02          Can they make money? Uh, what are the barriers to entry and as far as that's concerned, right. And secondly, secondly, um, is it in the service provider's interest ultimately to make extra cash for such bad press? I, you may see nothing happened as a result, but I liked the idea that the marketplace, that consumers have a choice, and when consumers have a choice, they're going to go with what works the best for Groupie. I do too. But I do believe that it's entirely possible that large corporations could have monopoly, real, real influence over the way our culture has access to information. I think I agree that should be stopped, but I also think that these fucking government organizations almost all suck. They're all filled with unmotivated people who suck at their job and the bureaucracy and the fucking red tape gets deeper and thicker. I think almost every government organization that does any task is flawed. So the idea that we should have government take care of these issues. I have a problem with that too, missy both sides of it.
