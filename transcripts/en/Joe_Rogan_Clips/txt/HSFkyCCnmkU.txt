Speaker 1:          00:00          I want you to just to fucking hold nothing back. And then I went up after him. You know how I did fine, didn't do good then do did fine because I knew how to handle myself, my professionalism, the craft of what I know one out. But there's no following that with what I do, which is totally different. And having the audience go, oh this takes it to a whole new place. No. Did you ever listen to the day the laughter died? Rick Ruben with them? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Fucking phenomenal. Great album. Just eating shit. Right until hours. He showed up at danger fields for people who don't know. It's literally, I will never forget, I was just starting out. I think he did this. Look this up when that was, I want to say it was like 1989 1990 no, it was after that. It was fairly early.

Speaker 1:          00:51          It was fairly early because I was very young in my career. It might've been then cause I was still living in Boston. No, no. It might've been then because 89 yeah, because I was thinking about me living here now. But it was, it had came out the first time I lived here. Well, I was living in Boston and I was just starting out and there was a great comedian named Mike Donovan, who to this day is one of the funniest guys I've ever seen in my life. And uh, Mike Donovan was laughing to the point where he couldn't breathe at dice doing this set while he was doing fucking stadiums. I mean, dice was doing enormous Nassau Coliseum. What's in the bowl, bitch? Oh, 20,000 people. He was the biggest comedian of all time and he just decides to show up at danger fields in New York city randomly on like a Monday and a Tuesday night.

Speaker 1:          01:43          It doesn't tell anybody he's going to be there. I mean, there's 1320 people in the crowd. He records two different sets and he has no material. I mean fucking none. He's making things up as he goes along and people are getting angry at him and they're walking out and he did a bit about Richard Nixon about how he eats ass and when he eats ass he does it like Richard Nixon. He was like, Oh, I love this fucking house. He was doing this Richard Nixon impression of eating ass and for whatever reason, Mike Donovan thought it was the funniest thing he'd ever seen in his life. He was wheezing, like couldn't breathe, talking about dice doing this impression. And I was like, wow, this is like comedy for Comedians. But for the people that were in the audience, like a guy got up, he goes, you're about as funny as our glass of milk.

Speaker 1:          02:31          The Guy said that to him and then left and that's one of the best things on the album. These people from like Kansas getting your about. It's funny as our clause on milk and walking off and dice shitting on them, but the two to have them mindset to be at the, not just the top of his game, but literally the top of standup ever. No one before him had ever sold out Madison Square Garden multiple nights in a row the way he did. I mean you guys have done it since then. You know Dane and Louis and this been a bunch of guys who've Aziz, but no one did it like he did. Then. He was the first ever to do that. And to do that and then to record these fucking awful sets and then put it out. We're gonna fucking pull. I guarantee that was Rick Rubin's idea.

Speaker 1:          03:22          Do you think so? Without a doubt. But you know, does dices like Dyson? I know Rick Rubin. I bet it was both of their ideas. Well maybe you didn't fight Rick Ruben. I'll have to ask for a group of next time I see him. Yeah, asked, never asked him that. But that sounds to me like Rick Rubin going, let's do this. Interesting. Yeah, but it was such a crazy bold move. I remember thinking at the time because I was terrible in 1989 when it came out and I was just like confused. Like how does one do that? One is so confident they released something that sucks. Cause I had as I was when I was 19 it's me and my girlfriend, Mark De mi and Marta were sitting in my car and I had a cassette player and we're listening to dice. It was just called dice and crying, laughing, crying, laughing. It was before I'd ever done stand up. And I remember thinking, Wow, this guy is fucking something. Like what? What? Like the, the, the amount of power that he had like onstage and these roars from the crowd and we're sitting in my car laughing our asses off to this seat. This cassette wasn't even CD that couple of years later he decided I'm just going to put out something that's sucks.

Speaker 1:          04:33          The day of the comedy died. Did they? Laughter died. Yeah. And he's got like one of them fucking paper Boi hats on the cover. Oh, it's a old man. Black point. And there's the little picture of him on there. Is that what it is? I can, yeah. Small picture I think. Or maybe it's a big picture of him there. It doesn't really remember. Oh that was a big picture. We should get up. Oh yeah. So it is small in comparison to the actual CD. Yeah. See if we can get Jamie, let's get a framed copy of that and put it on the wall somewhere. Was it released as an album like, I dunno, guarantee image. I guarantee there's vinyl guarantee. Yeah, let's get find it. See if we could buy it. And Vinyl. Look on the very right now for the day that they did it again, get it three years later.

Speaker 1:          05:26          I've seen him do that at the store. I seen them go up late night at the store. I'm like, look, good. You look at you over there and just start talking shit to people like me. What does he wear? Weightlifting gloves whenever he's like touching people's hands. Is that what it is? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And Big Jay Oakerson whereas weightlifting gloves in Omaj to guys. Yeah, no, that's great. Yeah. I was trying to get the two of them together in a podcast, but scheduling wise, it never really worked to shaking the dice. Doctor's hand photo on the final, Oh for 400 bucks on Amazon. Oh, by that shit. No, no, no. We're gonna frame hundred bucks. I'll go to dice. He might not have it. Yeah, I guarantee he's got it. Yeah. You pay for lunch. I'll give you the, the, uh, the album. Have you ever seen his Instagram?

Speaker 1:          06:11          If we go to dices Instagram? No, it's hilarious. It's just so random. It's like an older rich, famous guy who does whatever the fuck he wants. Opposed to IV, had coffee or lunch with them a million times. I had never had one of those things. Never happen. Yeah. Yeah. He um, he used to, I miss him like with, with a gold's gym tee shirt on with crazy sunglasses and he'll do like these little sketches, but they're so random and weird. Like him talking to a girl, look, maybe we should do something later in the girl's like, okay, like click on this, play this, this is like his, this is his whole thing

Speaker 2:          06:50          like skateboarding. I was thinking about it. Maybe we should do that. Can you cook dinner for her? Here's the question. What are you? Stay on the phone. What's your name? Nicole. Nicole. All right. I'll call, I'll call you. I've got to go take this.

Speaker 1:          07:18          Oh, it's the end of it. Afterwards he goes and he's got another one, a follow up when he gets mad at himself for not doing anything about it. Like go to the next video that's sided. There's another there. Play this one. What a beautiful night. Huh?

Speaker 2:          07:36          Beautiful. That's it.

Speaker 1:          07:40          It's out in the Lord. It's just this little beautiful Eleanor Kerrigan. Yeah, they're so random. The videos, I guess the text in that video was like, I should've done something. What's wrong with me? Yeah, but this is him. Why did I leave? I'm so dumb, but they're so random. It's like, what is he doing? He's just been dice. He used to do that at the store. He used to have comics do these little sketches is, okay, you're going to run through the door there and you're going to knock him over and you're going to go, what the fuck? Okay, go and the guy would do it and you run into the door and knock the the guy over and go, what the fuck? Go. Perfect. Do it again. And he would just, he would just film this with like VHS tape, you know, like an old school one and then he would edit it together himself.

Speaker 1:          08:31          But he did nothing with it. And this was like dice was giant, just fucking top of the world. China. And this is what he's doing to amuse himself and love comics. The comics would just do it. Oh Jesus Christ. You're just so happy. Dice is talking to you. He's the reason why I started doing the road. I would just do the store all the time. It was constant. The store one time were in the bag goes, oh you're funny. You know you should do the row. I go, yeah. He goes, Eh, it was, you don't want to rely on these fucking assholes for money. He goes, you could fucking do whatever you want. Go through the road. I was like, yeah, why don't I do the road? Cause I was just doing TV shows and then you know, do you, you're doing TV shows, you kind of trapped in this, this is how you make your living. You got to kind of always be acting and always be going on auditions. I was like, yeah, I was cause I wasn't making, you don't make real money at the store. You make like 15 bucks a set or whatever. We make, you know, I, I've spent.
