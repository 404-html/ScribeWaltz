Speaker 1:          00:00          That's an expert over there I have to do with it. Loves it. He gets crazy. He'll come back and tell you who's dating, who they run the Twitter and all the means of it all comes from, they run Twitter. Why do you like 25% of Twitter memes and everything is coming out of black Twitter, 25% did you do the math? It's known fact Bro. Like Bro, I didn't pluck it out of my ass. Okay. Um, speaking of social media, have you seen all these purges recently? There's a new round of it that just happened. No. Who got purge, 800 or 800 or more accounts were purged from Facebook and Twitter and they're all almost all alternative media accounts. So some of the sites are snowflakes was one I think on Facebook there's another one called anti media that was purged. They're an antiwar media thing.

Speaker 1:          00:46          Free thought project is another one this and there was cop watch police. The police was one of them that was called. So basically, and what they're saying is it's such a bullshit argument. They said, oh, the reason we pulled this is because it's inauthentic behavior. We're pulling these accounts because there's inauthentic behavior on those accounts. What does that mean? I don't know. That's the point. And they never clarified. So what I think it means is, hey, these are, you know, these are alternative media outlets and we want to get rid of them, so we're just gonna get rid of him. Because Facebook, I know met with the Israeli government and Israel told them, hey, listen, if you're going to be in our country, you're going to get rid of certain accounts. And Facebook went right along and said, sure, we'll do that. China with Google.

Speaker 1:          01:26          Right? But now I think they're doing that in the u s now, I think there, yes. I think they're working in cahoots with the u s government. And so you have all these alternative media counselors specifically, you know, antiwar, what have you anticorruption some of these are okay, and they're getting purged. No. The argument was inauthentic behavior. Yes. That was one of the reasons they cited as to why they got rid of them. Inauthentic behavior. Does that mean that they're talking about instances that they're misrepresenting? No, I think it means more like bots. That's how I interpreted it. Like, Oh, you know, you're posting it and you're directing people to your own, you know, stuff and, but I just, everybody does that on Facebook and Twitter. Is it possible that that's what was going on? I don't know. I'm just asking is it possible they were using bots and perhaps directing them towards revenue creating sites, but my whole thing is why shouldn't that be allowed?

Speaker 1:          02:15          Well, I'm not saying that it shouldn't be allowed, but is it possible that they were using stories that were taking place in the news, distorting those stories to get people to click it on things that would have links to ways that these people can make money. So instead of it being some sort of political activism website that really was just a revenue generating bullshit site that was trying to drum up artificial outrage. I think for some of them it's certainly possible, but certainly not. Certainly not for the free thought project. What does it free thought project? It's, it's another one of these, I think they described themselves as like an antiestablishment or anticorruption um, you know thing where they cover all these stories related to government corruption, kind of like a wiki leaks type thing except they don't do the Wiki leaks, does more of the original reporting stuff and they'll just cover it after the fact.

Speaker 1:          03:01          And how many people Facebook deleted them? Facebook, I think I read them. I think there was an article in the Guardian, Jamie, if you're interested in pulling it up, it's um, Facebook and Twitter purge. Uh, you know it was 800 sites. So when you mix it was like, I think it was mostly on Facebook, like 600 or so on Facebook and the 200 or so on Twitter that they did. And a lot of them were like one of the accounts had over 3 million people who liked it. Now the free thought project that, what has their response been to this? I don't know. I don't know cause I only saw the original article. I haven't seen anything after it. You know, this is a discussion that I was having with already the other day. We were taught here it is. First they came for Alex Jones. We told you you are next.

Speaker 1:          03:41          We're, oh, we were next. We were, this is on their website. Um, but they did cover it in the Guardian and some other outlets in case anybody is thinking that this is bs. Yeah. Good. It is a scary time because you see that this can impact, you know, really anybody who's not toeing the line, if you will, like a police. The police. Are we really gonna like do we really think that they pulled that down? Not for the obvious reason, which is that you're sowing discord and the police don't like it as part of its purge. Facebook has removed the pages of several police accountability, watchdog critic groups, including Copblock, the free thought project and police the police. They've also apparently severely restricted. The activity for the photography is not a crime page. Huh. So you think they're getting pressure from law enforcement? I don't, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          04:32          But I never usually believe in a smoke filled backroom conspiracies, but they're starting to get hard to avoid because there's so many of these things, man. Um, scroll down please. Here's what we need. Look at this and how does this poem, and again says first they came for Alex Jones and fours, but I wasn't race baiting transfer Spirasi cultists to claims for murdered children. Newtown. Where are hoaxes and admitted in court that I'm just an entertainer who makes shit up? So I said nothing. Yeah, they're just trying to be flipping about how Alex Jones was pulled. The problem was once you bought into the principle of Alex Jones being polled, well then what you're saying is people who are executives at these companies can willy nilly decide whoever they want to pull down. Now my answer to that has always been we should take Twitter, Facebook, these giant social media pages.

Speaker 1:          05:16          They can still be private companies, but we should regulate them like their public utilities. Yeah. That's the argument that our Arya and I were discussing a hundred per, that's the only answer because you need to default to free speech. Now, I'm not saying if somebody is doxing somebody or if somebody is directly threatening somebody and stuff like that, there should be a process set up where you can ameliorate that and do it quickly. But having said that, like people forget man, the Acl, you used to defend the KKK in clause, so would already brought up. Yes, and they said, hey, in Skokie they said, hey listen, we know we don't agree with these people. We think they're heinous. We think they're terrible, we think they're dead wrong, but they have a right to say what they're saying because once you get rid of it for them, what people don't realize though is that these things will always come back against people who are powerless and marginalized. It's not like when you censor, everybody gets together and we all go, okay, so it's just the Nazis, right? Yes. It's just the Nazis. No, first of all, who's running these? You know these organizations, obviously they have their own opinions and their own vested interests and their own power dynamic issues and they're going to take down whoever threatens their power

Speaker 2:          06:15          now is are all these organizations is still up on youtube and Twitter and Google?

Speaker 1:          06:20          I don't know it. To my knowledge, the only one that totally got pulled down everywhere I think was Alex Jones. He still has it

Speaker 2:          06:25          website here. It says all but proving the case that this was a coordinated attack by the tech giant community. Shortly after the purge on Facebook, Twitter followers out, wiping out our profiles on there as well. They gave absolutely no reason for the suspension. Said we had close to the Freethought umbrella, had close to 6 million followers. Wow. Isn't that crazy? And they just decided overnight. What's crazy is I didn't even hear about things. Well, that's why I'm here. I appreciate it. Yeah. I mean I had heard that it was 800 different pages, but the way I had read it and I had, unfortunately I don't have a lot of time and I was flipping through something. I had read that it was a lot of um, anti-police pages.

Speaker 1:          07:08          Some of them were anti police, but I think um, a lot of them were not. A lot of them were antiestablishment anti corruption like they've always had it out for wikileaks. For example, Wiki leaks as well. I mean you've had Mike pump pale one of the top Trump administration officials because it says they're like a non state terrorist actor. Think about that. That's nuts. That is because basically what they do is what registered reporters should say, hey, here's what the bad guy, here's what the people in the government are doing and this is the stuff that they're keeping secret that they shouldn't keep secret and our government goes, oh, that's terrorism.

Speaker 2:          07:39          Now when Twitter or one of these people, one of these organizations, bands, something like the free thought project, do they make any statements or they just remove them all? I saw what was on the Guardian article and on the Guardian they said it was inauthentic behavior was the reason why they were pulling them and maybe one or two other things that I'm forgetting at the moment. That is a fucking weird statement. I know. Authentic behavior. Yeah. Yeah. It's fucked up man. Cause they could just do it to anybody. That's the point. And that's what's so scary. Well that is what's scary, right, is that there are, they are private companies and these people are allowed to post on them until they decide they're not allowed to post on it because they violate their terms of service. But when your terms of service are that open ended inauthentic behavior, like what the fuck does that even mean?

Speaker 1:          08:26          So they just, they leave the terms of service purposefully vague so that they can get away with knocking off wherever they want to knock on.

Speaker 2:          08:33          It's just weird that they all agreed that Facebook agreed and Twitter agreed. Like what would be the incentive of Twitter to follow suit? Will it be the incentive space back room I but what, what do you think is given to, if he had a speculate. Okay. What do you think would be given to them that would give them the incentive to want to pull a site? That's what I like that Jack Dorsey guys seems pretty progressive.

Speaker 1:          08:56          I think they are meeting just like what we said, we know they did this with Israel where they pulled down pro Palestinian human rights pages to allow Facebook to function in their country. They said you have to do x, y, and Z. I think that there are meetings with, I don't know exactly who it is. Our intelligence agencies, law enforcement, FBI, I don't know. Somebody like that. Maybe Ceos of various corporations where they say, hey man, listen, the these people are problem. These people are problem. These people are a problem. Let's do the right thing here. I would like to hear a contrary argument. Well, I would like to know Emilia, I would like to know like what is the, what is the contrary argument? Is there anything that we're missing? If we want, we could try to find the guardian article and read what they said, what Twitter, what Twitter and Facebook says, see if you could find that.

Speaker 1:          09:41          You know the Guardian article. It's not coming up. Pulled it off the Internet. Guardian. What did, what was the headline? I searched it and went on news and like there was no articles from the Guardian. By the way, the only two, the only two things I found, the only two things I founded on our t and the Guardian and nothing else. Which is why you didn't hear about it because mainstream media didn't talk about it. Because guess what? These outlets, oftentimes our competition in mainstream media, what the fuck man that is. So the Alex Jones thing is really like a test run almost pretty much searching on their website, on the Guardian website. We thought project it's using Google to do it. And the top article is something of for for about food and 2013 well when we get off here, I'll do a search and we could see if we could find the statement.

Speaker 1:          10:30          Yeah. But when we get on fairs not helping all those people that use us right now, they saw from the free thought project, I'll find it. They saw the article from the free thought project and that says the same information. We just don't have the exact statement from Twitter and Facebook on it. That's the only thing I see. If you can just Google statement from Twitter readout was involved. The free thought that wasn't in the article, they just threw it in the middle of the article. It said it was like Facebook and Twitter purges, uh, accounts for, I don't know if it's at an authentic behavior in the title, but it was in the article somewhere. So you really think that there's some sort of smokey back room deals where they say, listen to you, you guys are making tons of money. We've got a bit of an issue here.

Speaker 1:          11:06          Let's work through this. This is what we want removed. These people are causing us a bunch of problems. I don't know, but I, I do know they did that in Israel. I do know they do that in all these countries where the governments say, hey, in order to function here, you have to do x, y, and Z. Right. So why wouldn't they do that in the u s hmm. That's what I would say to that. But what groups would want the free thought project or police the police removed? Well, you got to remember a lot of these. So the police accountability groups, I mean it's pretty easy. Law Enforcement Wa would want them removed, right? But do you think law enforcement has to kind of pull to go to Twitter and snap, hey, not like the, you know, whatever the police department in Toledo, but if the FBI may be sure, or the CIA or you know, whoever major law enforcement, general law enforcement, the thing that people kept going to with Alex Jones was Sandy Hook, Sandy Hook. He said

Speaker 2:          11:54          children didn't get killed. You don't have to defend Alex Jones on the merits of that point because he's dead wrong. On that point, when you're descending is the principle of letting somebody speak. I understand. Yeah. That's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is there's no thing that they're going to on this. So it's like there's already been a precedent set that could just remove people. So they remove him and they got this really clear here. It got sloppier. Yeah. Well it got more clan to Stein because there's no, there's no big smoking gun, there's no nothing. It's just all of a sudden they're yanked. Yup, that's right. And again, no major mainstream media outlet in the U S reported on it. Our T is Russia today. Jamie's guts on the exact article. Okay. This is of all media by Facebook is pushing back just to beginning censorship insight. They may cite the Guardian article in this article. I was looking, I'm like, okay. They didn't worry about, because I saw this article that came out. It's US pushing back today from today. This is from today. Today. Okay. I saw a different our tea article on the same it down and make that a little bigger please.

Speaker 3:          13:00          Hmm.

Speaker 2:          13:01          So that it's so people are starting to catch on to it. Scroll left. So we could see, there we go. Um, the latest and appearance of an apparent sense of ship of political speech online us based tech giants this month shutdown hundreds of user accounts, some belonged to wells to abas alternative media outlets with hundreds of thousands of followers like the free thought project or anti media senior fellow at German Marshall Fund, a leading think tank advocating you as global supremacy seems to have at least partially taking credit for this. It says in quotes, Russia, China and other foreign states take advantage of our open political system, Jamie fly set. They can invent stories that got repeated and spread through different sites. So we are just starting to push back just this last week, Facebook be can't began starting to take down sites. So this is just the beginning. Okay. So what they're saying is that these websites have been infiltrated by people from China and Russia, is that what they're saying? But scroll back up again, please

Speaker 2:          14:06          stop. It said China and other foreign states take advantage of our open political system, Russia, China and other forums. And so that is, that is somebody from the German Marshall Fund a leading think tank, advocating US interests saying that because we're so scared of Russia, Russian, Chinese, Russian and Chinese infiltration. That's why we got to pull down. So in other words, they're saying, hey, maybe these accounts like the free thought project are run by people who are trying to destroy America. So we have to pull them down exactly beyond a preposterous argument. This is what they're saying. They're saying they can invent stories, they get repeated in spread through different sites. So we're just starting to push back just this last week, Facebook again started take down to this just the beginning. So they're, they're blaming the influence of Russia and China and that they're saying that this is their excuse for taking down these pages because these pages are being compromised by foreign agents.

Speaker 2:          14:56          It's the oldest trick in the book to say, Oh, these foreign entities or sowing discord in the United States. So therefore we're not going to allow this dialogue to happen. In fact, I remember they blamed Russia for black lives matter Facebook pages during the 2016 election. But what's fucked up about this is there's not even any smoking gun. There's not only is there no evidence, they just say it, right? They're not, but they're not even pointing to a specific example. Yeah, that's right. Any example, yes, you're correct. Scroll down and see if there's anything in this that makes any sense.

Speaker 2:          15:29          According to the account fly complained that any person with an email could set up an account on social media and potentially reach a wide audience. He predicted a long global struggle to fix the situation. Jesus Christ. Oh, great. He started his career as a u s political circles as an advisor to George W. Bush administration also always trust those people. Right. Also a foreign policy and national security consultant for the Senator Marco Rubio. Yeah. These are the geniuses who should regulate the Internet. Right? These guys who've been wrong about everything reliably. Well, this is the thing. If you could just say, oh, the Russians have influenced this. The Russians are a part of this. The Chinese. Okay, pull it. It's hacky and it's partisan and it actually works on for on the left and the right. Sometimes it works on Corporate Democrats and people who want to blame Hillary's election loss on the Russians and it works on you. That play that. Let's hear him talk because here we are, a little bit of it. Can I jump? Go to the bathroom real quick. I'll be right back.

Speaker 4:          16:35          Principles, values as one of our greatest strengths and therefore one of the best ways to weaken us. So I think that that's one of the key things to understand here is Putin is acting actually out of weakness.

Speaker 2:          16:47          And why have we Jamie not come to understand, or at least the consciousness in this country does not necessarily view Putin

Speaker 1:          16:55          aligned with other strong men figures. This has been a long running problem in American foreign policy. This is not just a problem that started with President Donald Trump. I served in the Bush administration. President George W. Bush tried to form a relationship with Vladimir Putin to get certain things to advance US national security. President Obama tried the same thing with his, his reset of Russian, uh, US Russian relations. So it's not unusual that you have in administration that maybe doesn't necessarily view Russia as the threat that it is. Um, I think the, the politics of this, the public opinion right now, it's very interesting because you've actually seen a shift over the last several years. More Democrats now actually I think, uh, actually view Russia and Putin as a threat, uh, compared to where they were still here. But

Speaker 2:          17:43          boy, this gives you, it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Is it idea that these people are just deciding to remove pages and there going on television giving these interviews saying that it's because of Russia and Putin without any evidence.

Speaker 3:          18:03          Okay.

Speaker 2:          18:03          Oh, that's so creepy. They didn't share the evidence. Why you got to say something man? I mean, if you want, if you believe in a free society and you believe in freedom of speech and freedom of expression and you censorship censor people or shit bro, what's going on here? I'll fix it. I would only go with that and maybe that, um, what happened? Nothing. So they don't have a fix for the, for the way that it's happening. So if you show the evidence, then you're, you're literally like showing the criminals how to, how to do this and it could just run, run more rampant and they got to plug more holes. Well, that would be the devil's advocate position, but you, in order to take people down, the thing is if they're doing it and no one's pushing back,

Speaker 2:          18:46          you're just going to be able to do it with anybody that disagrees with you or anybody that is going to be an impediment to your political campaign or anyone's getting the way of anything you're trying to push through. And this is, this is a giant issue with people that have that kind of power that can influence Facebook or Twitter. And if that's the case, and look, we don't know, we haven't talked to Zuckerberg, we haven't talked to Jack Dorsey. We don't know who's, who's pulling strings or who's asking them to do things or what evidence they presented to them. But that's just very uncomfortable. It's very uncomfortable. See that guy talking and bringing up Russia and Putin because people bring them up like they're the boogie man, you know, this is what's sort of the Russian Putin. They're, they're, they're interfering with our democracy, interfering with our issues here in America and they want, they want to ruin democracy and it bring our country down from the inside.

Speaker 1:          19:32          Yeah. It was like, um, the Internet went through a phase of like it just totally free and open wild, wild west type thing. And uh, now it looks like they're trying to reel it back in and it's like, that's the viewed as the public square. It's supposed to be that these social media outlets, which are so gigantic and so powerful that this is now the public square. So to be able to censor people in these, in these forums should be considered unconstitutional, coordinated, inauthentic behavior. Oh, you found it, you found the article and spamming.

Speaker 3:          20:03          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          20:04          But again, the like the websites that they actually pulled down, that totally destroys their argument. Even if you buy into the premise that these are, this is a good reason to pull somebody down. I mean some of the people that the, the pages they pulled down were so well established and there are of course not inauthentic in any way. It's people who are running these pages that really deeply care about these issues and want to get this news out to people.

Speaker 3:          20:30          Fuck,

Speaker 2:          20:32          this is a good quote here. Drawing the line between real and inauthentic views as a difficult enterprise that could put everything from impartial political parody did genuine but outlandish views on the chopping block

Speaker 1:          20:44          and by the way through, there are politicians in the u s this happened

Speaker 2:          20:48          during the debate between Ted Cruz and Beta O'rourke all at the exact same time with the exact same hashtags. There were pro ted Cruz things tweeted out at once. So at that is there are bots that they bought to help Ted Cruz win the election. That's election interference. That's inauthentic behavior and nobody is talking about pulling down those accounts. Look at it says here in a statement post to online newsroom. Facebook says it, purge those pages because they're owners were using fake accounts, sharing the same content between multiple pages and linking to add supported websites. It calls ad farms. So what that doesn't even, is that even a controversial, but this is where it gets interesting it says, but what the social network calls spam the owners of these pages call standard procedures for operating on Facebook. Yeah. That was like, I don't even think if the argument from Facebook is correct that that really is a reason to pull them down.

Speaker 2:          21:44          We could, it says here, nearly all the page owners contacted by the Guardian say they use backup or fake accounts. Hmm. Along with their real ones. They do it in part to protect themselves from being targeted by political opponents and having their real accounts end up in Facebook jail, reverb, press, a left leaning news site whose Facebook page disappear yesterday. So this is on the left and the right. They're censoring people because you've got snowflakes on the right. There's another one right wing news that was pulled down. Stop scrolling please. But, but look at this. This is really interesting there. So they're admitting to disingenuous behavior though they're using fake accounts to protect themselves from being targeted by political opponents. Well it's so, but that's if that's the case, they are violating Facebook policy. So I've seen this on Twitter. I know people who have gotten their accounts banned on Twitter, but they create a new account and they stay on Twitter and that's technically a violation of terms of service.

Speaker 2:          22:39          But it also is something that I don't think is egregious at all. Right. But there's a big difference between someone getting banned and then starting a fake a second account. This is not that they're, they're using multiple accounts at the same time in, some of them are fake. Look, I'm not, I'm not justifying their being banned, but I am saying that they violated certain procedures and they did. So in order to public publicize their ideas and they did it to try to make their ideas more, just more project them more have, have more, more bandwidth. But according to Facebook, should you not be allowed to have like three or four accounts where you tweet the same stuff or post the same stuff? Because it seems likes book said though, what Facebook said. If just scroll back up to the beginning, scroll back up at the beginning please.

Speaker 2:          23:23          At the top, the top, the top, top, see what it says. A coordinated, inauthentic behavior and spamming. So they were spamming. And that does sound like coordinated inauthentic behavior. If they have a bunch of alternative fake sites and fake pages that they're using to spread their stuff. Look, I'm not saying that they should have been. This is, I think better would be to say, hey, you can't do that. You've got to remove these fake pages that are publicizing your ideas and just have your real authentic page. But what they're saying is that they're, they're, they're leaking to add farms and that they use this to publicize their pages and that everybody does it. Everybody does it. You're not supposed to do it. So why wouldn't they pulled out? So let's say the free thought project have three or four other things where they were posting the same stuff under a different name.

Speaker 2:          24:16          Why would you not pull down the three or four other things and leave up to fit the free thought project? I think they're saying cause the Freethought project violated their terms of service. You're not supposed to do that. And they don't want them to do that. I don't know. See, here's the thing. Would they have pulled the free thought project down if they hadn't engaged in any of these forbidden behaviors? Uh, my opinion is I think yes, maybe that's what I think. Maybe, but that is gross. You're not supposed to do that. And I'm not saying that they, they should be polled, they shouldn't be pulled, but maybe they thought this is what they have to do to get the word out. And maybe Facebook is like, hey, you fucked, you're spamming and you're, you're linking to these ad farms and these ad farms have been known to, you know, be influenced by Russia and China and all these other organizations.

Speaker 2:          25:03          You're doing it just to promote your sites. But we're saying that we can't allow that kind of behavior. It just strikes me as very strange that when you have examples like the one I just gave where maturing in the Ted Cruz Beta O'rourke debate, they all tweeted the same thing at the same time. It was obviously paid for by some right wing think tank. You never hear the story of something like that. If it's benefiting us politician or something like when Mitt Romney bought like a million fake followers on Twitter and a 2012 election, you never hear about like, okay, we targeted that. It's always like, oh, it just happens to be these independent alternative media outlets that are spreading information that the government doesn't want people to know. Well, it could be that these people are saying, hey look, everybody does this. We're going to do this, and they're saying, we don't like them there.

Speaker 2:          25:46          Oh, and look, we caught them doing something we, we don't allow. Yeah, let's sweep them. But that's possible. But is it possible that they wouldn't have been removed if they hadn't done this shit than not supposed to do? It's possible, but I don't think it's likely. I don't know them because here's the thing. Look, if it's only people who've engaged in these forbidden behaviors that get removed, then Facebook has a very good argument. But if Facebook is saying this, but then people removed who are straight above board doing everything the right way, just have their own page posted information on their own page and they were never removed. But these are all political and alternative media, which is interesting. So there were targeted, yes. All right, so they're targeted, but in the targeting them they found a bunch of shit that you're not supposed to do and that's what got them removed.

Speaker 2:          26:35          I think that there is a good argument, uh, that Facebook could make, which is very much a nuance troll terms of service argument. But I think it's more of a veneer or facade than the real heart of why they did what they did. But again, that's just my opinion. I'm not stating that as a fact. I agree with you. I mean, surely what they should have done, especially given the popularity of these sites, is warn them and say, Hey, you've got to stop doing this because if you don't, we are going to remove you. You are violating our terms of service. You are linking to add farms and you have posted from multiple fake accounts stopped doing that. Just use your one authentic account. We support free speech. That's what we would both like. Right? Yeah. Sure. Yeah. I mean, it could be also that they feel like the right wing sites do this. We have to do this too. This is how people do it in 2018 is how you really get the word out. That true. Yeah. You know, I just, I've found it interesting that it was all alternative media and political accounts and restore left. It was just the main thing that seemed to be the connecting tissue through it all was relatively antiestablishment. Right. All right.
