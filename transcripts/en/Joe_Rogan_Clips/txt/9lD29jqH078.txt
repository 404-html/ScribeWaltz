Speaker 1:          00:00          Eight walkers at the, but, well, I don't understand how you think that we, we, you're almost losing America and there's a battle for America in every regard in terms of just the people that were running like Hillary Clinton. Like this woman was a globalist. Like, just think about who we were, who we were in bed with, like Saudi Arabia selling all of our uranium to Russia. Like, like Trump came in and was like, no, like America people. We were the gap. Like we lost them. We're losing the middleclass a gap between the rich and the poor was like literally causing that, uh, policies, shipping all of our jobs overseas, the regulation, the government getting bigger and better. You can't do anything as an entrepreneur entrepreneur in America without a piece of paper from the government, discouraging people with this piece of paper, like sending, like shutting down the factories from getting that there's something, you know, there's a little land between New York and La, I believe it or not.

Speaker 1:          00:51          Like, you know, and this is what Trump understood. We were losing that and, and Trump appealed to that. Those people. I'm still floored, like as I'm traveling the world and seeing different pieces of the country, I'm learning how ignorant I was like, and that's the best thing in the entire world. Just I fell victim to the idea that like it was progress, it was progress, it was progress. We have to care about the environment. It was progress. And it's like, no, like we've been losing America has been losing and Donald Trump understood that. And in a way that I didn't end, I thought we have to care about the environment. Not even a little bit, not even a little bit. No. Okay. Let me, let me clarify this. I don't throw trash on the ground. Like, and I'm not saying like we need to like, you know, trash the environment.

Speaker 1:          01:32          Like, um, but do I believe in climate change? No. You don't believe in climate change? I think the climate always changes, I guess is what I should do. I believe that this is like, you know, an issue that, um, is being that that is fatal global warming, which they've changed conveniently. They got rid of the word one. Scientists started disproving it now based only say client climate change. Um, now I think that that was just a way to extract dollars from Americans. I don't at all believe they had no actionable plan. It was great for Trump. Took out of that deal. It was terrible. Okay. But this is an incredibly complicated subject, right? If you would have to talk to a bunch of different scientists and see how they gathered data and see what they understand about co two levels and what's the danger of them, right, and what can combat it and what could not.

Speaker 1:          02:14          Have you done all this? So I think flipping opinion. Listen, I'm not, this is not, this wouldn't be the hill I died on, right? But it's not about the part. I just genuinely, I've read a ton about it, but I would not be able to, I would not be able to come to you and say like, this is my strong opinion. But here's like the easiest way to say this, right? The fact that there is a disparity in the science committee about whether or not it's real, it's enough to have very little disparity. Most, most, most scientists, most the vast majority agree that human beings are negatively affecting climate change. Yeah. The vast majority. Yeah. I don't, I just don't think so. So you think that the very few scientists that disagree with the consensus or the ones that are correct? Well, I think if something is it, it's, it's either subjective or it's objective and their objective truths. Right.

Speaker 2:          03:00          But it's subjective. If you're saying that there are some, I don't think there's very little, there are some that don't get paid to go on TV then some of that or not bill Nye who are not funded scientists. Um, and, and that has been a hold, well not assigned to, you know, just not broke my heart when I found out mouthpiece. But that's the, that's the point. The son of a good word. I don't think Al Gore is a scientist, but bill Nye is like a science influencer or a science entertainer. Like it doesn't have a background in actual science. He's not a scientist, doesn't have a phd in science, had to do with Phil Knight. He promotes science. Science is not bad. But the real problem is with climate change is that we for sure there has been ups and downs throughout the history of this planet.

Speaker 2:          03:48          There are observable. They've, they followed them and we was one of the subjects that I had earlier today with um, Dr Robert Schoch in 2014, the vast majority, 87% of scientists said that human activity is driving global warming. Yet only half the American public public ascribe to that view. So 87% and this is scientific American dotcom though. Like that, that means it's, it's making money. I don't trust that. If it was a.org I would probably take that. But that this is just a random website and scientific American is not necessarily a random website. I don't believe this at all. Just so you know, you don't believe it. Like I genuinely don't believe it. I know you do, but I genuinely don't believe it. I believe most of the time the consensus of scientists that are studying the data, and so what they're doing is studying all of the stories that came out about the scientists that said that when they tried to present their evidence to show like they were basically just getting shut down at every corner.

Speaker 2:          04:44          You can pull that up too. Like scientists who look up, look up the opposite, right. Instead of instead of looking for, didn't search for it. That's what I've found when I searched it. Sorry. Yeah. Look up is my question. Why are you so sure? This is an extremely, extremely complicated subject. I said, I am not so sure that I would die on the hill for it. My opinion right now, and it's just that it was a means, because forget the fact of whether you believe global warming is real. Let's say it's 100% real estate. We know faculty wheel. Is there a, well, let's, let's be clear. Global warming, global climate change is definitely real. It's happening. The question is, has happened. Yes. It has always happened. What are we, what is the, this is the climate change. Yes, the climate changes. It was different weather yesterday than it was today.

Speaker 2:          05:33          The climate is forever changing like that. That's the problem is that people are making it seem like that's something weird. No, not less. Not your, you're misrepresenting the issue. The issue is people think that human beings are exacerbating climate change to the point where there's a, there's a tipping point. We cross over that tipping point. We're going to deal with huge problems that could be corrected if we act now and put a lot of funding into climate control and this is what Howard bloom was on talking about a few days ago. He was talking about that the real future involves the technology of climate control and that what we have to be really careful of is letting it get too far where you can't ever stop it and pull it back. This is what scientists are warning about. This is why they want emission standards. This is why they want to figure out how to get people to be aware of the fact that this is a real issue. Now it regardless. Human beings, if they never existed, the earth has constantly gone through cycles. The question is not whether or not the earth has gone through cycles of cooling and warming, right? The question is, are we exacerbating that? The vast majority of scientists say we are okay now this could, this could negatively impact all sorts of coastal cities. This could be a gigantic problem. This is not like propaganda that's drummed up by some sort of big business that seeks to make money off of this or some sort of a,

Speaker 1:          06:55          well, they won't even say ship it. Al Gore might've made some money off, but who's making money off we went that we were in and they were, they were. That was like the amount of money that America was losing. But here's what I was gonna ask you, so let's just let mount of money. America was losing. What do you, who was the mayor of Paris Agreement? This is the reason why we wanted to get out of the Paris agreement is, but that's where I wanted to get to. Let's say we all agree that global warming is real. I don't believe it's real. Okay. So I can't sit here. The question for why have a belief? What do you mean? Why have a belief as to whether or not global warming is real or not real? Because I just, I just find that you don't understand the science, but why have a belief in it? Right. So it's how I believe it's on a belief in, I don't believe in it. But you have a belief that it doesn't exist. I know. I personally think that this was just the next, the fact that it was presented to us by Al Gore and it's just, it was, yeah.

Speaker 2:          07:46          Not presented to us by just by Al Gore. Al Gore made a v a film. Right. And he's been called like the first green billionaire who's made a shit load of yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:54          Any flies in his private plane because he's so worried about the admissions. Okay. That is hilarious. Hilarious about that. All of the people that are telling us a fucking politician, right. There's gross and is to all that stuff. Right. And that's what worries me. So my question is, let's say that it's real. Okay. Let's just assume like if that's the best way to have it today, let's say it's 100%. Yeah. Do you feel that you have found in your research that there is something that human beings can do that would change this all around?

Speaker 2:          08:22          That's possible? Yes. One of the things that they're figuring out how to pull carbon out of the atmosphere and even even possibly reuse it. There's, there's all sorts of things that people are trying to do. I mean we had, um, what was the young man who made that uh, device boy, boy on slot. He figured out a way to uh, make this device that pulls plastic out of the oceans. They're figuring out a way

Speaker 1:          08:43          very important. Yeah. There's a lot of it will pick as plastic just can't like over time. But that's what I mean. Like, so when I say that I'm like, and I believe in recycling. Like I'm not like a person that's like, this is the idea that the government is just going to take the trillions dollars because we're in some agreement where we're all agreeing that we should do something. Is, is useless. And look from the stuff. Like there's obviously a lot of debate here. And as I said, like I'm not, so at the one thing you'll always find with me is I'll never pretend to be so educated. Something like I'm not going out in college campuses talking about global warming. I don't do that. Right. But why are you saying that you don't, I just, I just don't, I just, I don't know. Maybe because they got so close, maybe because it got so politicized,

Speaker 2:          09:19          uh, studies into scientific agreement on human cause, global warming and look at all the studies. It's between a hundred percent and 91% at the lowest. 91% of one of the studies from 2014 with the Union of concerned scientists. Yeah. Work. They almost, it's, it's a pretty broad consensus. Who Do, who are they pulling? Is it the people that are a part of this? No. Um, it's a good question. That's what I'm asking. 10,306 scientists to confirm. Over 97% of climate scientists agree in over 97% of the scientific articles find that global warming is real and largely caused by humans. So my question to you is if you want to step outside of the scientific consensus, which is vast and involves 10,306 scientists and just say, I don't believe in it. Yeah, even if you're right, even if you're right, you don't have enough information to say that. Right? Correct. I said this is what you're saying. You don't.

Speaker 1:          10:24          I don't, but yeah, I would have to have someone sit down and convince me that it was real. I personally don't believe it. That's okay. It's good. It's good to start at a place of not believing something. No, it's not. You think you should start with believing everything. Okay.

Speaker 2:          10:35          It's did not believe either or not believe. Yes. Not believe, no, but don't say you don't believe. Yeah. I learn about it. Learn about it and then have an opinion. But you're stating this opinion without having any real

Speaker 1:          10:46          standing on what climate science, but that's, that's exactly what an opinion is. I'm not going, like I said, if, if, if you said that Ken, as you went on to 10,000 college campuses and you said that global warming wasn't real, then we'd have a problem. You and I are just having a conversation.

Speaker 2:          10:58          Yeah. But why have an opinion on something that you don't have data about? This is my question. Like, yeah, I don't necessarily have an opinion on climate science. I really don't, cause I don't know much about it. But what I do know is that what I've read is that the vast majority of people study it or an agreement the human beings are affecting. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          11:17          I don't, I just, my recall on a lot of the things that I read, and this was a while ago, so this is why where I, when I first formed my opinion, I'm not believing this. I read a shit ton of articles, can't recall the data. Cause it's like I said, this was something I was super passionate about. It was like somebody posted something and then I went on like a tear or reading about it. Um, but it was essentially just noting that. And a lot of the studies, like when you go in, you, if we had time to sit down and really pull this up, they're pulling, you know, 10,000 scientists that are within a community that is fun. Like these.works. Do you believe? And everything that media matters. Dot media matters. Dot Org puts out for statistics. Right? That's a political, that's a arm of the Democratic Party,

Speaker 2:          11:55          but I know, but I'm just politics versus science, but this has been politicized that science has been politicized. Yes, it has. Global warming in particular has been politicized 100% it has been politicized. Right. That's the whole reason that I fell down this dark hole one night reading about it and I did. I was like, you know what mean the day? I don't really care. It has been politicized. I think that's also maybe why you're saying you don't agree with it so quickly because it's an idea. That's why I read it. An ideological right wing point is that global warming isn't real. If you're one of those people that thinks global warming isn't real, you're almost always on the right and that's fine. But I'm telling you that again, I didn't do a deep dive on all of this because I read about it because it was at a forefront of discussion.

Speaker 2:          12:35          And so I read about it all night and my conclusion was that they started pulling up all of these studies from the person that you know did this and I did a deep dive on and they started showing how like these community of scientists were in fact somewhere behind that.org as someone that was being funded. So to me, the issue got to politicize for me to, to, to believe that global warming was something that was going to wipe out the world. Now that is a fact, but that doesn't mean that the funding affects the scientific research and the data which they all agree on. And this is universally across the entire plant, thousands and thousands of scientists would not stake their reputation on false data. What what they're saying is not that the only reason why the world is getting warm is because human beings that the only reason why the climate isn't totally static for the rest of eternity because of human beings.

Speaker 2:          13:24          What they're saying is we are negatively impacting our own environment and we're doing it because we existing negative in RG and we use coal and fossil fuels and emissions and we're raising our co two levels and this is based on data and this is, this is something that you can look at. You could look at the data and follow where they're getting this information from and follow how they're making these conclusions and follow. The vast majority of these brilliant people study the shit their whole life. And if I look, if I was a person that was putting forth policy on climate change or if I was a person that put out by opinion publicly on Paul on on climate change, I would do all of that. I'm just not, I understand what you're saying, but what I'm saying is that you are a very smart person and people listen to you and they're going to listen to you for a long time.

Speaker 2:          14:13          I believe this is a this, but hold on, let me finish what I'm saying. One, depending on how you don't have to have a formal opinion on everything. What you do have to have is the ability to know when you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. You said you don't believe it. Don't be. Maybe you asked me and I said this wouldn't be the hill I chose to die on because I don't, I don't why? Let's say you don't believe in because I just personally, if you bought not have a belief until you really prefer if my language as opposed to admitting that I do not know this, I wouldn't die on this hill. I've never made a B. I've never made a public statement. You would have preferred if I had just started it by saying I have no, I have no opinion. No, don't know.

Speaker 1:          14:52          Okay. That's what I'm saying. You, you say, don't you say, I don't believe in it. I don't believe it. You're, you're saying really clearly that you don't think it's real. I mean, I think it would be the same if I said to you like, you know, uh, do, do you believe in God right now? I would say, I don't know. I feel like this is sort of like linguistics though. No, I would say, I don't know. I always say I'm agnostic. People say like, I believe I believe it or I don't. Right. So it's like if you say, I think a lot of people say they don't know. I think believe is definitely where the associated with God. But, um, but if you say, I don't believe in God, and then somebody starts saying, oh, you need to form it did, it's like, it just, I just don't believe in it.

Speaker 1:          15:31          No, you don't. Because God is not scientific data. There's a big difference between measuring the co two levels in the atmosphere and the deciding whether or not there's an afterlife. I just, I, I'm sorry that I just don't believe, I don't believe in global warming. I'm happy to five. I had married an influencer and you're a very bright person. I would if somebody had asked me like at a place where on influencing on a college campus, what's your opinion? I would say I have none. I bet you would say I don't believe in it like you just did. Absolutely not what you just did it. There are so many instances where you could watch it just like, and you can ask Dave Ruben when he asks me a question, I say I don't have, no, you and I are having a conversation one on one. I'm not, I'm not sitting here to try to, I don't go on campus talking about global warming because I don't, I don't have an opinion on it.

Speaker 1:          16:18          If you press me and asked if I believe in it. No, I don't really believe in it, but it could I go deep dive and and, and learn that perhaps I'm wrong. Sure. I personally am inclined to believe that a lot of those studies are manipulated. As I said during the one night that did deep dive on it and when they showed like all of the pieces of evidence or whatever, it just seemed a little shaky and I felt that it was politicized. But I think I have a right to say that I don't believe in something, but I then I also don't know. And that's what I said to you. I don't believe in it, but I wouldn't die on this hill. I don't know enough about it. But you also said you don't believe in it and you stated the reason why, because you think it's a scam.

Speaker 1:          16:54          I don't, that's the truth. What do want me to do? I'm gonna lie to you. I'm not, I'm not sitting here saying like hated issue. It may complicate. That's fine. But what do you want me to lie to you and say, if I'm not a politician, you want me to say you should the correct term. Like the, I feel like this is like the editing of people do like when they're like, oh, a bond. If they ask a question, you don't know. This is the way I'm not running for office. I'm answering, I'm talking to you. I don't believe in it. I appreciate you. I can't be fake. This is my number one problem in life is I can't be fake. And I know that you're pressing the air and that you want me to adjust and to say like, I don't, I do not have an opinion or the, but I'm not a politician.

Speaker 1:          17:28          I'm telling you I don't believe in it. Could I? Could I change my perspective? It was even in a year after I read just a regular person, you said, I don't believe that I'd probably go all right. The problem is you're not, you're, you're, uh, you're a very influential, I'm aware when I'm on stage, when I'm on my, you could tell you there's no videos of can. If someone's talking about global warming, I'm aware of that. Exactly. Now it's going to be rubbing again. It's by the way. I should, yeah, exactly. We're going to be mad at me.

Speaker 1:          17:57          We know. What's funny though, is that like it, this feels so like we're not on the Internet right now, but it's like I still don't feel like we're on the Internet. This is the problem. Yeah. Well, like if we were, if you and I are on a college campus, I'd be like, Eh, I, I'm not really sure. I don't have them for my discussion. Jack Shit about global warming or really don't. Yeah. I think with the real fear is not even global warming. The real fear is global cooling. The Ice Age is the most terrifying thing that can happen. Human beings. Yeah. That shit happens. Everybody dies. Yeah. I know. Global warming, you just move inland. Yeah. I think that the real thing that people are concerned about is like, just beyond any of that stuff. I don't know. I think that there's like more concerned in society. Like I personally think that some scientists are talking about global warming and it got politicized. They figured it was another way to extract human beings money because of fear. That's my opinion. Okay. I think there's probably some truth to that. We're going to find our core scientists that agree with everything we saved. It's improving that Harvard studies had been in incorrect because they were being funded by, I'm certain you know, political interest groups, so I'm not inclined to pull up something on a, and. M

Speaker 1:          18:55          I'm blanking. It'll come back to me in a second. But there were Harvard papers that had been funded by certain researchers that are trying to get a certain political position out in it causes mass fear and people are willing to spend their money a certain way. Charlie possible. It is. It's real. That's very real. People are flawed, so I'm not inclined. When someone pulls up an article and says, look, a 10,000 scientists, I err on the side of, okay, I don't know those scientists are, I don't know what the rest organization is funded by, so I'm going to stick by my guns and say, I don't really believe in it yet. Now, if I decide that I'm going to run for office and I've got to make a decision on, on the atmosphere and in, in what we're going to do about global warming and cu two missions, you better believe I will be fully ready to discuss it. I'm not going to make a youtube video and just know the outskirts of it. I don't do that. Right. But if you and I are having a discussion, sorry, I don't believe it. Like, I mean almost to say, open, open to learning, open to learn, always open to learning. I've, I've been wrong before. I was a liberal two years ago, you know, um, or three years ago. So that's, that's not a problem. I'm open to learning, but I'm not going to like

Speaker 1:          19:48          pretend like, say something that feels inauthentic. And what I wanted to say there was, I don't believe in it. It's just one of those things that it's become, it's a real right wing talking points.
