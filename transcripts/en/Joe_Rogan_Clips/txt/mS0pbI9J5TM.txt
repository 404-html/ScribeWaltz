Speaker 1:          00:00          It's coming. We'll have fuck buddies. They are. Everyone has guys and girls have fuck buddies. Yeah, I am. I'm almost, everyone I know has had one in the past where you weren't in a relationship with them. Really the drive over and fuck and bang and then all right, bye. Yeah, bye. But you kiss at the end. That's a lot of checks these days. I think they didn't even want to see, they only want a kitchen going to want to see you. Sometimes you open the door, the girls, they're ready to fuck and then just walks off in the other direction. When you're done, puts a blindfold on you. Bird boxes are done with us, man. Fit done. I feel like they're done. Do you feel like that? I think it's a precarious time. A lot of chicks are probably going Lesbos this week. Oh, it's the dude.

Speaker 1:          00:40          I would be with Trump. I think the more days that the the government shutdown, the more women are going to go lesbian thinking that hate men so much because of Trump. They just can't go gay, but people always say people. Right now. That's not how I remember what I said earlier about jokes, but if what's funny to me as gay guys are always like, I'm going to turn this guy out. And that always sounds alarming. That does work. But that sounds alarming. Does sound alarming. But it does work. I have, I don't want to say I almost said his name. Uh, he worked on, she wasn't, he was not an actor, but he worked in the world of acting and he told me that he blew a lot of straight guys.

Speaker 1:          01:25          That was just something that happened. They would have a couple of drinks and pretend they'd never done it before. And next thing you know, yeah, I got that delicious mouth. That's what a lot of gay dude say. It was either him doing them or them doing him, but he's like, you'd be amazed at how many, you know, air quotes, straight guys are out there. My like, yeah, and he's just knows how to swing it. But will you, do you think, is it less homosexual to jerk a golf with your left hand? What are you left handed or right handed? Right handed. So yeah, if he jerked you off with your left hand, it's gay. Or to do it with your right hand is geared to do with my left hand. The one that doesn't work as well cause it'll take longer. Yeah, but you don't really have, but it's understandable. I feel like it's understandable if you do it with your left hand because that's barely even your hand. It's my hand, Bro.

Speaker 1:          02:16          You're not going to feel that much of it though. She jerk him off with your right hand so you should be effective and get it done with. And once you like holding on Dick's longer, don't come yet. Hey Buddy, I'm right here. I'm your pow. I know what's going to happen. You're going to come the, you're not going to want to hang out with me anymore. Oh Gosh. No, no, I wouldn't do that. Just go fast. No, I don't believe you. I think not. I think you, I think you, I think you said that left hand. Is that red? That's the party move. You know, because it's not, you can still use this hand and to be on your phone. You can do other stuff, but then you're not concentrating on the jerks and the guy off. Look, once you commit to doing something gay, just get it done, son.

Speaker 1:          02:57          Just get after it. That's true. You don't want to be out there halfway jerky guy off while you're pretending that you're looking at, you mentioned this, but also what about this though? If you are aggressively very effectively jerking the guy off, right, and then you can barely use your phone. It looks like you're just like, ugh, maybe gay or bi gentleman that's on some dope or something. You're doing gay shit with your on your phone and okay, that's a good sound. Like it acts as a condom to prevent you gayness struck. You're doing gay things mean you're holding onto a dick. You just got to accept that and keep moving. There's a lot of people. Yeah, you're right. Just take the next right action. There's gay people doing shit that's gay. The straight people doing shit. That's gay. Everything's changing now. Jerk that man off.

Speaker 1:          03:39          Once you commit to that project, just keep going and yeah. What's the payoff? What do you got out of jerking him off? I don't know. I don't think I, let me ask you this. Here's a question. If there was a place, is this conversation seem gay or if life was free, if you could really do whatever you want, if you're a grown adult, you can do whatever you want. I mean, that's one of the interesting things about society is that we set up these rules and cultures and we decide what you can do and what we decide is different when the deciding Hollin is different when they, and everybody's got different rules. Yeah. But once we set those rules, it's very hard to buck those rules. Now let's just pretend there was no rules. What if there was a place where guys would go and guys would jerk them off and pick new jerks? Yeah. Like if there was a place where guys, straight guys got a job jerking guys off, but you, it cha you, you get paid $1,000 an hour,

Speaker 1:          04:40          you don't think the straight guys would take that job straight struggling guys then would, they would morph and figure out a way. Oh, just over a generation or two. Just a generation or two. If you could make $1,000 an hour beaten guys off. Yeah, it started as like a best you can each job. If you could wear an oven Mitt while you do it, I wouldn't do it. Just do we do we figure that out? If you could wear an oven Mitt while you do it? No. No warm oil in your bare skin. That's the only way to jerk guys off. You got to do a quick bro. Dude, there's a way. Other ways, man, you could definitely do it. One way you could do is even you even wrap your hand. You just do like that release a sideways like Kentucky Fried Chicken. There's only one batter.

Speaker 1:          05:22          Crispy batter is bullshit. Nobody likes that crispy batter. The Fuck Outta here. I'm trying to think if I had the jerker w one thing about jerking off to me, I feel like there's not as much calm in your body is there could be. You know what I'm saying? You don't get that much at, well, it depends on what you're jerking off to and you know how focused you are on the task. If you're jerking off while you're looking at your phone, yeah, but you, you know you're checking your Twitter and your also beaten up. Yeah. You're multitask, but you're not going to get a lot no matter how much you know, how, how, how, how, how you do it. Really? Yeah. How much do you get? You get like a little bit, how much do you get? Like if you had compare it to something like a quarter? No, probably like maybe a like an 11th of a handful, I guess. I don't know. How big is your hand, dude? I can't even, do you still masturbate as an adult? No, I do it as a child. I mean, I'm just saying I put a diaper on and it makes me feel like rejuvenating myself. I feel like you'd rip your Dick off it. He tried to pass her many routes. I feel like.
