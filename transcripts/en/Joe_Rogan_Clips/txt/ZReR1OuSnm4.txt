Speaker 1:          00:00          Do you watch those movies and shake your head? I like him. I just, yeah, I like science fiction, you know? Right. You know, so yeah. I don't sit there. I grew up with star wars. That was my, when I was nine years older son. Finances just don't, yeah, I'm not having this. I did, I did a an igert with Neil the grass, not an argument but a debate with him about lightsabers ones cause I claimed that they're physically the in principle there possible. Um, and he was trying to say that they aren't, but they are what did have to loop back around cause the light's not continuing to like the fact that it goes to a certain distance and pauses. We'd have to have a mirror or something, I guess. Yeah. Something that's going to be the end of it. Right. That's true. So it wouldn't, it'd be a different kind of lights out there.

Speaker 1:          00:40          The only point I was making is that photons, particles of light can bounce off each other. So we see that in really high energy experiments in parcel accelerators. We can collide photons together. So my point was a bit of a pedantic physicist one but he's, cause he, it is true that it light can bounce off. It can hit light but very, very high energy. But when they press that button to a certain distance, I wasn't, that's engineering. I agree with you. I agree with you. The distance thing, I agree mass to it. Right. So as you're swinging it around, you wouldn't have the leverage of a long thing. So why not make it really long? Cause it wouldn't be difficult to swing around. Like you get stabbed someone with a light saber a mile away. That's true. Right. That's just to laser and it, yes. Like why, why make it so short?

Speaker 1:          01:35          You have to swing, you got to be close to hitting a person with it. It's a silly silly design. You are picking holes correctly in the engineering. Part of my, the only point I was making is that physics is, that we showing is quite interested in, is like can bounce off light. So, but it would have to do, it would have to be something that causes it to stop at the very end. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Which would be, you're right, it have a mirror it, but he wouldn't look cool with it if there was no kind of thing within, which drives me crazy about star wars is not the light sabers. It's the lasers. When they're shooting the guns. I'm like, why can I see that? Well I can't see bullets. Yeah. This is supposed to be way faster than a bullet. Like easy to see this cause it's like George, you can duck, you can get out of the way.

Speaker 1:          02:22          Those things, they really slow. So angry. I feel like this is so dumb. I could go warp speed in this Millennium Falcon and travel the speed of light, but for whatever reason, these lasers are so slow that you could duck out of the way of them. That's so dumb. And he's not only star wars is, it's everything. Every single film does that. Yeah. Yeah. Why we slightly, it's like films, like also I worked on one of these films years ago. Sunshine Klove underappreciated. Moving. Yeah, I think so. I think brilliant film. But in that, so they asked me or Danny said, I want to do it right. So do the spacecraft without any sand. So when he's traveling through space, there'll be silent and it looks shit in it. Just that when you watch, yeah, it's the same way when you try and fill master naughts and you and they're in zero g and they always move slowly.

Speaker 1:          03:13          It's like why, you know, you're right. You're right. You'd be able to move very fast as you want, but it looks silly. So this kind of, uh, uh, I suppose it's what audiences had got yeast to over the years. And so in the end, you have a best friend has best apart from 2001 which didn't do it. Yeah. Silent in 2001 well, Kubrick was a stickler for science and for you, he was apparently he would do complex mathematics in his spare time. What fascinating guy. That must have been. Yeah, I read that they just, um, someone just found an interview, didn't idea the day where he explained the ending of 2001 I didn't say that. Yeah, I saw it yesterday actually, and it was, it was kind of a really simple version of it. He just said, well, the sea for intelligent beings take him in and put him in a zoo, could basically and watch him grow old and then send him back to the earth as a super being, but that's it.

Speaker 1:          04:08          That's the worst explanation at the end of 2001 I've ever heard, but he was key bricks. That's what cubic said, so that he falls into the monolith. Yet they just put them in this room, which is kind of a bad version of a French chateau or something watching grow old and then send him out to the earth as a super being. Wow. Okay. That was Kubrick's. Yeah, Persian. I strange. It's a, it's a, it's a weird genre, right, because sometimes people get things right, like didn't hg wells predict a, a significant amount of scientific inventions in the future? Well, there was these, I mean it depends which one doesn't it? There was a moon one wasn't there. He did an agenda to the moon. I mean he's time machine is not able to do that really worked out yet.

Speaker 1:          04:58          But yeah, I think it's, I always liked science fiction. I like Arthur C. Clarke a lot. You know, cause I, I think it is, you're right, it's is a, a form that you can let your imagination wander and address things with that restriction. I think, did you like the alien series? I loved it. Yeah. So I leave when I was, uh, I, when I was at school, he's nine 79 and we had a school film club in the Seventies. They weren't like they are now, you know. So the first films they put on the three films, I was 11 and it was alien apocalypse now in life of Brian. Wow. Which I, so that was my introduction to, to cinema, how well those are three great choices, but I feel like really Scott's original alien is probably one of the greatest horror science fiction movies of all time.

Speaker 1:          05:44          And one of my all time favorite movies. But I really like the newer ones as well. Like I like promethium and I really liked covenant the, the last one. Yeah. From atheists. I don't know. I, yeah, it's not the best one. Oh look, they're like what they're trying to do with it. The, the whole idea of what the engineers coming back in time and that's it. That's why I was disappointed with it. Cause I thought the up the opening is brilliant and I thought this is just going to be brilliant. Right. And then I thought it just lost its way and it was a disappointment because it could have been so brilliant. Yes, I agree with you. Yeah. The beginning was fantastic, but I think covenant was more, more exciting. And what's also preposterous, like if you went to another planet, I, the last thing you'd be doing is just breathing in the air.

Speaker 1:          06:27          Right? I mean we'd have to be really cool if there was a life on the planet, we'd have to be really careful. A not to contaminate but be not to be contaminated. Right. Yeah. I mean, yeah. There's also, I mean, you know, the other thing is science fiction films is gravity. Cause you always give me an alien. You always just say the spaceships got gravity. There's again, there's only 2001 right where everybody floats around. Yeah. Because all has a spinning thing. The spaceship has gravity, and then when you land, the gravity is exactly like earth. Yeah. Perfect. Yeah. But it's, you know, it's ridiculous. Yeah. I mean, with what are the odds that you would find a planet that is exactly like, even if a planet was one and a half times the size of earth, it would have far more gravity. Right. And that's, that's really common for a planet to be like, just a little bit bigger. Yeah. And then we'd be like, fuck everywhere it'd be walking. We'd be, we'd be getting crushed. Right. I agree with you. Yeah. Well, I suppose that's not the point. It's about ideas, isn't it? Science.
