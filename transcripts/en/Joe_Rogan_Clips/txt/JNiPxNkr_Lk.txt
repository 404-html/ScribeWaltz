Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. What do you say to someone who is happy with what they do lives a fulfilled life exercises and is still depressed? Yes. I thought a lot about this, but remind me to come back to the thing about east London. I know this is, this is an issue with a lot of people. I, yeah, I know people that worship at the altar of science and modern medicine that firmly believe that all depression is because of some sort of chemical imbalance in the brain in anything that debates that are anything that disputes that notion is, is pisses them off. Yeah. No, I understand that. And I would've been like that for me. That, yeah, of course I was looking at, I met him in a year. Do you get that? Some people responded.

Speaker 2:          00:39          Sure, of course. Of course. I think the, so the World Health Organization is the leading medical body in the world, right? They did a survey study of all the best evidence and they explained very clearly that the mental health, um, is a social indicator, right? It has social causes that need social solutions as well as individual solutions. The science of this is overwhelming. You won't get many scientists who say, uh, in fact, it'd be struggled to find any scientists who say depression is purely a biological phenomenon. Right? Pretty much everyone agrees there's some social and psychological component. I think when we, this weird disconnect between what the scientists know and what the public is told, right? I don't know anyone who went to their doctor who, um, apart from this wonderful doctor in east London and we can talk about who went with depression. I, that he was told anything other than a biological story I'm in there, may be asked, you know, some of them were asked about childhood, you know, what was your childhood like?

Speaker 2:          01:31          And referred to a therapist, but no one was talking about these wider social causes. No one started like, do you feel controlled at work? Well, like I, it's a fact that could be making you make you depressed, but in terms of the people who, who, um, who are depressed but don't, uh, cause there was a mystery to me. Right? I knew people, I thought, but this guy has got everything and he feels he's still depressed. What's going on here? I think there's two things to say about that. One is I started to, for various reasons for research for something else, I was reading some like feminist texts from the early sixties right? And a really common thing that happened in the early sixties is women would go to their doctor and they'd say, doctor, there's something really wrong with my nerves, people to talk about in terms of nerves.

Speaker 2:          02:09          Then we don't do that anymore. Uh, something really wrong with my nerds because I've got everything a woman could possibly want. I've got a husband who doesn't beat me. I've got a car, got a washing machine, I've got two kids, but I feel like shit. Right? And the doctor would go, you're right, and give a value. Now, if we could travel back in time and speak to those women, what we'd say is right. You've got everything you could possibly want by the standards of the culture. But Stan is the cultural, just wrong, right? As a w as a woman, as a human being, you need more than just a washing machine and a car. Right? You need a fulfilling life of meaning and purpose. And a very similar thing I think is happening today if you, so if you don't want, I speak to people who say I've got everything I could want but I feel like share.

Speaker 2:          02:46          So tell me, tell me about your life. Very often they're working really hard in prestigious jobs that they don't like. They don't enjoy hour by hour to buy things that don't give them pleasure. It comes back to this hijacking junk values that we're talking about. The professor Tim Kasser discovered. So what you've got is because we've been told a totally misleading story about what makes us satisfied and happy as human beings. I think it comes up again and again in the interviews you do, cause we'd been taught in different ways because we've been told them misleading story about that we live our lives according to the wrong script. We feel like shit. And rather than question the script, we think there must be something wrong with us biologically. Now there are biological contributions. It's supported to say that, but one of things that really blew my mind on this was um, Ainsley this woman, amazing social scientists could not to Bretford in Berkeley, she did this research.

Speaker 2:          03:34          It's kind of simple research. It just asked. Um, if you consciously decided you were going to spend more hours a day trying to make yourself happier, would you actually become happier? Right. And they did this research. She didn't do a loan obviously with our colleagues in the United States, Japan, Russia, and Taiwan. And what they found was in the u s if you try to make yourself happier consciously, you do not become happier in the other countries. If you try to make yourself happier, you do become happier. And they were like, what's going on? So they did more research. And what they discovered was in the u s and I spent a lot more time here, but in Britain as well, if you try to make yourself happier, you try to do something generally for yourself, you buy something for yourself. Your biggest self, our PA tried to get a promotion and the other countries generally if you try to make yourself happy or you do something for someone else, right?

Speaker 2:          04:30          You try to help your friends, your family, your community. Where, what countries? Just Japan, Russia and China is most of the really stress this, that if you, this is a part of their culture that if you want to be happy, you do something for someone else. It's, it's, it's so implicit in the culture that they live collectively that it's not even just like we wouldn't even if you said, do you think happiness is an individualistic thing? We'd be like, what are you even talking about? Isn't that sort of an extrinsic idea as well? The idea that you're going to be happy by trying to make other people happy, but this is a thing. So intrinsic values are not about just internal to yourself, the things that you value. So your intrinsic value could be spending time with your kids, right. That was probably most people strongest intrinsic value if their parents is being with their kids, bonding with their kids.

Speaker 2:          05:10          A lot of my point is if your goal is to get happy and the way you've chosen to get happy is I'm going to get happy by making other people happy. That's, that seems very strange. I don't think so. If you think about where humans are. Dot. Shouldn't you just make other people happy because you love them. But that is a way of loving people and being present with them is a way, but not as like a specific for with a specific goal of making yourself happy. That seems, that's not why they do it. It's not like when they were told, make yourself happy. They had an implicit script in their culture, which is like, all right, if I want to make myself happy, I'll spend time with other people or do things with other people. But if you think about it in terms of human evolution, it makes total sense, right?

Speaker 2:          05:52          I think about our ancestors where they evolved. If you were in, uh, a gripper, if our ancestors had been individually who were out to big up themselves as individuals, we wouldn't be having this conversation. Right? Right. So it makes us, we evolved as a species with instincts. The argument there, the motivation of trying to get happy by helping other people. It just seems be some implicit in the culture for most people in say China that they wouldn't even articulate it that way. It's only if you force them to say, look, try to make yourself happier that they, then the script becomes obvious. It's implicit, but this script that we have, this idea that the way you make yourself happier is as an individual, you know, just doing something for yourself and how you hold because there is not one script and this country of how to make yourself happy.

Speaker 2:          06:39          I think that's some sort of disingenuous as I did at the only way to make yourself happy is to do that. What? That's not what people are trying to do. What people were trying to do is be successful and I don't think they necessarily equate success with happiness. What would they do equate success with is an alleviation of debt and alleviation of problems and alleviation of a lot of the issues that people face. Hartley and they think of that as if you look at the problems that you have when you're growing up, you look at the price. Especially if you grow up in a poor family, one of the main problems that you face is you're worried about paying your bills. So you say, someday I'm going to get to a point where that is no longer an issue. I'm going to make it. I'm going to be successful there.

Speaker 2:          07:20          They're not doing it thinking this is going to make me happy. I, I've, I've very rarely see that and which is one of the reasons why people, even people's parents in this freaks me the fuck out. We'll tell them to not pursue their dreams, but instead to pursue something that's more likely to happen. Like don't pursue your dream of becoming an actor or a singer or whatever it is. Instead, pursue your dream of being the foreman at the company you work at because that's attainable. I think you're totally right and there's a lot of evidence that you're right, that the financial anxiety is a massive driver of depression and anxiety. Obviously there's a interesting study that found people who have an income from property are 10 times less likely to develop an anxiety disorder that people who don't, and there was a really interesting experiment in how we can respond to that.

Speaker 2:          08:09          It's when that President Obama said late in his time, he thinks would have to happen across the country in the next 20 years for various reasons. So in Canada, in the 70s, the Canadian government, um, chose a town at random, it seems to genuinely have been random. It's tackled doe fan. It's, um, anyone who knows, uh, Kendra, it's about four hours. I Winnepeg and they said to big group of people in this town, we're going to give you guys for the net for the foreseeable future. We're going to give all of you a guaranteed basic income. We're going to give you the equivalent of, in today's money, 15,000 US dollars. Right? There's nothing you can do. That means we'll take it away from you and there's nothing you have to do in return for it. We're just citizens of our country. We want you to have a good life, right?

Speaker 2:          08:49          It was partly because they had a kind of welfare system, but it was a lot of people were falling through the cracks and they wanted to do a little experiment to see what this web, and this was studied very carefully by a woman name to be called Dots Evelyn Bouygues, uh, to see what happened. It loads of interesting things happened. Um, people spent more time with their kids. Very few people quit work, but a lot of people turns down shitty jobs. So actual overall work standards improved because employers have to attract people with better standards. Um, but for me, the most interesting thing is there was a huge fall in depression and anxiety, depression and anxiety. That was so severe. People had to be hospitalized, fell by 9%, which is remarkable in just three years. And then the program ended. Dr for Jay said to me, I thought so much about that, that I'd learned about the cow.

Speaker 2:          09:34          Dot. Vj said, um, you know, that's an antidepressant, right? We should expand our idea of an antidepressant to be anything that reduces depression and that should include pills, but also, so you're totally right. I mean, look, I grew up, my dad, my dad's a bus driver, my mom worked in a shelter, my grandmother cleaned toilets. Financial anxiety is a massive driver of, um, of the despair. This, I mean more than half of all Americans have not because of the incredible financial pressure they've been put on, the got $500 set aside for, for crisis comes along. Right. So you're talking about that's a huge draw. And again, that's really important cause explain to people, if that's making you depressed an anxious, don't let a doctor tell you you've just got a chemical imbalance in your brain. Right. That's, we'll do doctors still say that all the time. My nephew's best friend, um, just literally a couple of weeks ago went to the doctor and was told, yeah, you've got a dopamine and balance. The doctor said is migrated in the 20 years since I went there from a surgeon in England, in England. I mean I get contacted constantly by people who were being told they've got chemicals, they're told they've got chemical imbalances.

Speaker 1:          10:34          Right. Are they just as likely to prescribe antidepressants in English as they are American? I'm slightly low, but it's still exceptionally high still. Yeah. There's a, that narrative that an antidepressant must be in some sort of a pill form and that navy, even the expression, antidepressant and antidepressant, it's, it's a very confusing thing that we've sort of adopted very quickly in this country. And it's a relatively recent, you know, over the last 60, 70 years. And the people that have antidepressants, uh, in their body that take them all the time and swear by them, boy, if you try to tell them in, in any way that there's a better option, they get extremely defensive. Um, I have friend, she's very smart and she's, she's one of the, um, one of the people that,

Speaker 2:          11:24          well, you know,

Speaker 1:          11:26          very aggressively debate this idea that it's anything but a chemical, depression, chemical, a inbounds, you know, but she doesn't take care of her body. She's not, doesn't exercise all the time. You know, she's slightly overweight. She doesn't eat the best foods. You know, it's, it's, it's a weird thing.

Speaker 2:          11:43          She's living in a society and culture that has all these forces that are arising that makes people feel terrible. Right? Yeah. And so a big thing to me is when I'm talking to this, because I've had some of that reaction, well not too much, but I've had some of that reaction as well. First thing for me to see, I would say I want to expand the menu of options. I don't want to take anything off the table, right? It's not about, you see that and I, and I think you're probably being pretty honest, but you really do want to, you want to eliminate Mo, but just by the standard of improvement, you do probably want to take most people off of antidepressants, don't you? What need do they have a choice? Would Jordan analogy, obesity is massively risen in the western world. It hasn't risen because people suddenly became greedy and lazy.

Speaker 2:          12:25          It's risen because our food system is terrible. The way feed supply system is terrible. And we built cities that people can't walk and bicycle around, right? And they're really stressed all the time and they get home from work exhausted. So they don't have time to exercise a lot of them in that context. Some people will do what's the stomach stapling, liposuction, that kind of thing. Right now I'm not against that. But if we change the society in the way that I would want to with obesity so that people could walk and cycle and you know, they had access to healthy food, far fewer people would need stomach stapling or liposuction. Right. So I would drugs, not a perfect analogy, but I'd say if the social changes that I want to happen happen, if we followed the places that have succeeded in reducing depression and anxiety over time, you would see fewer people feeling they needed and chemical antidepressants.

Speaker 3:          13:18          Okay.
