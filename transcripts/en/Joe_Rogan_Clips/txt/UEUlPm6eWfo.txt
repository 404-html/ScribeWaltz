Speaker 1:          00:00          In this politically fire. Hold on one second. What does, what are we going after me? Two people for, for me taking in the back, grabbing attention, grabbing your purse or your for you sucking my Dick for a movie role or for something like that. All those things really don't exist in my life. Right? I have a wife and I have a child. They don't exist them. Right. If you want to come at me for sucking my Dick and night in 2002 we were dope. Both doing blow guide be my guest, be my guest, but I want to see footage. I can't be, I'mZ , I'm Zari and take it and just, you know what I'm saying? There's a lot of people out there. They're going to get me to look at this other guy for years he was known as a heroin addict, never got a clue of of sexual misconduct and some chick said she molested when he was 11 years old and now he's like, you need that, you need that and the chicks on drugs.

Speaker 1:          00:48          She's doing the press conference while she's on drugs. What's his name? Brother? The one, the guy that was in heat that the narrow, put them in the Rehab himself and then he married Heidi Fleiss for awhile. Who was with Heidi Fleiss from Tom. That guy's been a junkie for 2000 years. All of a sudden, why can't I remember his last more size? All of a sudden some girl comes up when she had 26 kitchen. Yeah, he molested me on a movie set when I was 11 that's great and Dandy dog, but you can't ruin some of these life now, but what do you think is happening? This is my question like why are, why are people accepting these, these situations like the Chris Hardwick situation or why is everybody instantly thinking that the guy's guilty? No one giving him a chimp benefit of doubt. No court, no justice court.

Speaker 1:          01:38          There's no nothing and in some some cases, like the worst case was garrison Keillor. Garrison Keillor is the host of the lake. Woebegone chronicles like this radio show on PBS, I think it is. Is that what it is? He apparently hugged the woman and his hand went down her back. This is, this is the depiction. And he apologized to her and he sent her an email and she said, don't worry about it. It's no big deal. It was nothing. And then they continued, I believe, to correspond and we're friends again. And then this, all the stuff started happening with out Franken. And then he had this complaint brought up by this woman. She reintroduced it and said that a long time ago. He put his hand on my back and they canceled the show and they took his name off of it and they did it like really quickly.

Speaker 1:          02:26          And it's one of those things where you just go, okay, really, like the guy in one moment in time touches someone's back. I don't know if it was creepy or not. Let's assume it was a terrible error. And it was creepy. I don't think it was, I don't know. I'm not saying I know, but that's it. Just touching someone's back. And that is a hysterical reaction. That is hysteria. That's almost the definition of hysteria. You're not talking about an evil person talking about a person who touched someone's back. Like we gotta be real careful what you destroy a person's whole life with. So on the one side you have the worst case scenario, which is like a bill Cosby who's drugging people and raping people. So worst case scenario for these powerful elite type people that are getting these women into their web and Proton, we want to help him, right?

Speaker 1:          03:17          He's another one which day we're all in on it. And everybody knew about it for you as they knew about, written into his contract, it was a sexual harassment clauses were in his contract, right? It wasn't that. It was known for years. They sure we're correct. We really hot under. That bothers me about Harvey [inaudible], Harvey, what we got and died every body, there's a lot of people that have to be indicted and this is one of the things that mark feeling right now. This should be, this should be a Rico act. Wow. This is a Rico act. Agents, managers, Oprah, Eddie. Cause everybody knew every body. But here's the question. How much did they know? Everybody knew in 2005 right? Everybody knew Joe Diaz was a cold feet. That's a different thing though, man. Stay. Let's pretend, but the same thing. Okay, but let's go. Joe Diaz is a coke feet. It's 2007 Joe Diaz comes to a party house. There's two cell phones missing.

Speaker 2:          04:15          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:16          Okay. Let me, let me say this though. Do you think that it's possible that his behavior was shielded from some of the people that he interacted with like Hillary Clinton or Oprah or Bill Clinton or whoever that was, that they, some high profile people that he interacted with. Is it possible that they didn't know? Is it possible that they just thought he was a pussy hound? No. Or do you think they all knew he was a pussy hound and they heard little chitter chatter, but it's okay. It's okay. They would just let him show me. That's number one. That's crazy. Number two, Jamie, you're ready for this? Oh Jesus. Okay. I see Joe a whatever. Not now, probably five years ago.

Speaker 2:          04:58          Yeah,

Speaker 3:          04:59          I see Joan and the first thing I had to go with Joe before you leave, don't forget, I got to tell you the story. What was that story would be about? About Benson Henderson is choke about a joke that somebody said the store, no, I want a place I went to and some chick took me in the back of suck my dick on the car and then she stuck a finger up my ass. And that's what we talked about. So if that's what we talked about, you're going to look me in the fucking face like a man that you are in, the men that you've been around and telling me Harvey Weinstein turned to Brad or his other bodies and listen, remind me to tell you a story about that dirty fucking battle

Speaker 1:          05:44          for sure. Okay. That for sure. But that was that. That's that, that's been admitted. I think they've had conversations. Oh my God. If you don't pick the wig, Ben Affleck and the other guy, and I'm not offended though, but I'm just talking about boys were boys, right? Yes.

Speaker 3:          05:58          What you won't say to Jamie, you'll say to me, you go and you watch blind date. No, I'm never watches a movie. Blind blind crackers going off. And there's a movie named blind date with Bruce Willis. Oh, I remember that movie. And Kim Bassinger, how Larry is. Kim Bassinger steals the show when she walks in, the Japanese lady, she was like, you know, you're entitled to 50% of your husband's assets in California. And the Chinese woman kept saying me, no, speak English. They'll speak English. And I was like, you didn't even tell him 50% and she opens up the the 50% 50% that movie is a great word, but this is seen in the opening of that movie. Both of those actors are around where the guy comes up to him and he goes, you're not going to believe what happened last night. And Bruce Willis goes, hey, we go one of these fucking sex stories again.

Speaker 3:          06:49          I think it was, saw him at spa and go, I was like ham for dinner. I walk out and some lady pulls up with a limo and I say, I've never been in a little moment. She goes, we'll get in. And we were riding down sunset hard times in the summer and next thing you know, she's sucking my Dick. She's got leotards on eating her ass and he's telling the story in Bruce Willis or something. He goes, no, no. Why does this always happen to you? This is some other bullshit. He goes, [inaudible] and it goes in his pocket. He starts whipping out Polaroids. That I've always known one of those guys in my life. Of course, we've all known one guy in my life. That was the difference between that guy and what Harvey, why don't know. Yeah, I know that. But I also believed that Harvey Weinstein was telling people he probably was, because listen for everybody who told him.

Speaker 3:          07:40          Was he telling him that he was holding people down? What are they usually tell him? What was he telling? He was raping pieces. A piece of ass. No, not at all. Do you think that he did well, you got anybody to use a piece of ass. She's a piece of ass. You've got to see her suck a dick. She'll do anything. She's an animal. Well that's what we do as men. We're braggadocio. So do you think it was like a community of that were actors and actresses? I think he had four or five guys that knew what he was doing. I want you to remember being 27 and having for your boys that would come back every Monday with a different story to karate school. Yeah. I hate harass. I fucked her on fire. Whatever the fuck it is that you do. He told somebody, somebody knew about all these stories.

Speaker 3:          08:26          So my agents knew somebody because for, for the hundred of them that said no and whatever that had to be 25 he was playing the percentages, Joe. Well after they, in fact they said yes. They blame that one girl. That one girl that did rounders, they accused her. Yeah, I heard that. That played Matt Damon's girlfriend. She was, she went from being an extra and fucking uh, Donnie Brasco to being a guest opposite fucking, yeah. If you want to Donnie Brasco, she's, what's his name? Sonny black's girlfriend. You know what I mean? Line. She hasn't met movie zero, zero smart move. And then a year later she's a fucking guests opposite. So there's a bunch of them that said yes, but you fault the girl for doing that over girl decides to chocolate Harvey Weinstein on her own freewill when we come here with a dream. And there's two ways to enhance that dream.

Speaker 3:          09:28          Because I always knew that I wasn't good looking man. I always knew I was fat. Now I was knew I was r rated hard to listen to what I always knew that I was funny. So I always worked on being funny. I didn't think somebody was gonna let me suck their dick or eat that pussy to be a star. So that was never in my mind. But think about people who, how many people have you met with sell that. So when this town, how many people have come and gone in front of you? The reason why our friendship is still intact it because you know I'm a hard worker. You know our, he's a hard worker. You respect hard work. How many times have you pulled me aside and said, look at this fucking clown and you're not trying to be judgemental. You just know that he's pulling the wool over some of these eyes. We know who's talking to the talk and we know who's walking the walk. We see it on stage, we hear about it. You don't need Twitter of Facebook. We hear about it. We get to that club, the club on the rotate. Joe and Joey was here two weeks ago. He was falling asleep on stage. You know, you're his shit, right? So it's the same day.
