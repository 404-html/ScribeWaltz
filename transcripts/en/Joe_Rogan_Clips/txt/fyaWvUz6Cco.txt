Speaker 1:          00:00          Well, what, what, what do you do with them specifically? Well, I've been with him since 2004 and recently became his coach right before the first Denesha Johnson fight. And I'm going to head coach for Nma and you're in disguise in case some other athletes try to swipe it and it's Halloween. Happy Halloween. Everybody. Happy Halloween folks. So, uh, first of all, man, congratulations on your victory. Um, what does it feel like? Oh Man, it's uh, uh, it uh, it feels good. It feels good. Try to keep this silly a fist away from your face.

Speaker 2:          00:30          Yeah. Uh, it feels good because it's um, [inaudible] I think as a competitor you, you, you live for these moments. You live, you live for these fulfillments, you know? Yeah. I think somebody like, and then I told people since the beginning, it wasn't so much, you know, the UFC belt, but it was because it was it. I made it about Demetrius and it was about Demetrius, you know, cause I was

Speaker 1:          00:49          mean. He is widely considered to be the best pound for pound fighter ever. And you're the first guy, not only to beat him, but the first guy who, not just to beat them, but mean beat him in like 11 years, but the first guy to win an Olympic gold medal in wrestling and a UFC championship. I mean those are two gigantic accomplishments.

Speaker 2:          01:09          Yeah, no, for sure. It's almost like a god, it's, it's, I'd beat the greatest to me the greatest of all time. And then on top of that, I be, you know, I can, I can make the run for, you know, who's the greatest combat athlete of all time. Yeah. Like it's a, I'm a two sport world champion. Just like,

Speaker 1:          01:25          yeah, Dale. I mean, you're absolutely in the running now. I mean, if, if he's not the greatest of all time, I think he is. But the argument is that he didn't face people as good as John Jones faced and then fade or is the other fade or an Anderson silver or the other people that are in consideration for the grace of all time. I mean, it's, it's just a subjective argument. I mean, who knows who's right, but obviously you beat without a doubt, one of the best ever.

Speaker 2:          01:53          Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and like, I would, I would tell people there's, there's a bit of a of admiration that I had for Demetrius Johnson. Like I was, uh, it was, it was like, you know, you're fighting the dude that's, that's, that almost seems untouchable that you see a guy that makes you question yourself like, Whoa, this is, this is this, this guy. Is that right?

Speaker 1:          02:13          Good. Well, what's crazy is you beat him after he had stopped you. Just how long was it? Two years.

Speaker 2:          02:19          Uh, but close. We're about two and a half years ago now. Yeah. About, I was like, I think two years.

Speaker 1:          02:25          Four months. That's, that's an amazing turnaround between getting stomped in the first round and then coming back and beating him and beating him in the championship rounds is really where you pulled it off.

Speaker 2:          02:37          No. Uh, and that, absolutely, I had studied Demetrius Johnson like as soon as a lost on the first time. What I pretty much did is I got, I got rid of a lot of people, including my, my MMA had coach. I just, my whole philosophy was, if I can't be the best and there's something wrong, you know, emotionally, physically, everything. I was just invested. And when I, I'm just like, man, I need to, I, I'm looking for a better leader, you know? And, and that's kind of what I did. I ended up, you know, letting go a lot of my cornerman, you know, started traveling the world. W went out to Singapore, went out to a, to Thailand, went out to, uh, to the Netherlands, spend months and months at a time out in Brazil. Like I, uh, I was on a quest. It was like the, I kind of remind myself, literally like ash catch him from Pokemon. Like I was just on a venture

Speaker 1:          03:29          vision quest vision quest. It was Matthew Modine move. I, even, Swain, Swain has to watch that movie.

Speaker 2:          03:38          And that's, and, and, and, and, and it'd be, like I said, it became in a session, I knew that if anybody could do it, it'd be, it'd be Henderson who to, like I really did it. And even after the first time, Joe, when he beat me, I still, when they asked me, it's like Henry, you know, like I would, I was like, guys, I don't know, but I still know that I could beat him even being knocked out like two minutes and 36 seconds. Like I still knew in my heart and UFC one, I sat there press crop that says, I know I'm still the one that's,

Speaker 1:          04:05          what was it about him that made you think that you could beat him? What was it about you specifically in relation to him and his skill set? It was a, um, I, if you're asking me what the difference, what was it that made you think even after he stopped you in the first round? Oh God. Uh, I think it was more so just believe in it.

Speaker 2:          04:28          My, and my abilities. I think me just believe in more. Okay. Henry, you need time. Like I was only doing MMA for three years when I fought him the first time.

Speaker 1:          04:36          Yeah. A lot of people don't know that. Yeah. The Sears you see you fighting for the title, not once, but twice that you probably had been doing MMA for a long ass time. But when you find them for the first time, it's a very, that's a very short amount of time to be fighting and MMA. It's especially again to caliber athletic. Demetrius, what year did you win the Olympics and, oh wait, yeah, that is, I mean when you're doing that you're 100% dedicated to wrestling. You have to be, right. So were you doing any striking training at all back then? Um, I did. I did. What happened was once I won the Olympics, almost kind of, I fell out of love with the sport. I fell, I fell out of love with Russ and I remember being at the Olympics and being like, man, I just, I don't know if I have it in me no more just cause you're burned out. I was, yeah, my whole childhood was gone because of the sport. You know, like crazy basketball further. What are you doing? I mean, anyway, I've been waiting for you to say that.

Speaker 1:          05:35          We'll do it in stages. So you, you fell out of love with it. I fell out of love with, is it just because your whole life had been dedicated to wrestling and you'd finally achieve the greatest, so great goals. Yeah. Olympic gold medalists is the top of the mountain. No, but check this out Joe. And it was like

Speaker 2:          05:55          in the year of 2007, um, bad I went through the worst year ever. Like I was ready to become a world champion and I went out to the world champions in 2007 and I didn't even score a point like in the first round, like I got put out by, by Iran. And uh, for some reason that whole year, man, I was just going through freaking struggles like left and right. You're talking about just that versus I couldn't want to turn him in to save my life. What was it? Um, I don't know. I don't know. I truly, truly don't know. I think I was, uh, I think I probably begin kind of fallen out of love with it. And I remember there was to me, there was only two tournaments that everyone had to win and that was, that was the Olympic trials and eventually the Olympic Games and, and somehow like, cause I'm correlating this with the, with the fight with Demetrius Johnson and uh, I remember, you know, just, just almost being in tears. Like I just don't know if this is for me and the, but I just stuck with it. I stuck with it. I ended up putting in the Olympic trials. I ended up going to the, you know, the Olympic Games and ended up pretty much fallen behind in every single match, uh, that I was wrestling in. So the, these are kind of the adversities that I was going through, like leading up to become an Olympic champion.

Speaker 1:          07:05          You know, it's interesting when you were fighting, um, Demetrius for the second time, Daniel Cormier said something very interesting. He said, most guys, he goes, I would never give a chance. You, you get stopped by Dj. And then a couple of years later you're fighting him again. Like he's, he's going to have your number where he's going to be better in the rematch. And he goes, but Henry, so who chose a different kind of athlete? He, and he talked about you competing and then coming back a year later and being, he goes, he was many times better. He goes, the, the amount of improvement that he got in just one year was just unbelievable.

Speaker 2:          07:42          Yeah. I think, you know, I guess she couldn't hold that teacher. Netics no, I think you could talk a lot about desire to just having the only get you so far what it taught, he had, the Olympics has, has g great genetics for sure. But it's almost, it almost becomes a, uh, a mentality on, because of a philosophy. It's like you almost start doing things almost like two to not feel the H to, not to not feel the pain of losing. Hmm. Like that's a motivator to not feel the pain of losing. And I remember when Demetrius Johnson hit me, hit me and hit me in the leg. And I had literally, I don't think he put your how severe it was like I literally spraying like a, a severe low ankle, spend those first 30 seconds and the second fight. So I fought Demetrius Johnson like that. But it was, it was to me the motivator was like, man, I don't want to feel that pain of losing no more. I hate it man. I hate feeling second place. I hate feeling Kinda Kinda somebody looking over me. Someone's a almost like a manhood challenge and I hate that. Was it a low leg

Speaker 1:          08:41          kick that uh, that been made your, your ankle go

Speaker 2:          08:45          go? Like what was it? It was a, there's a nerve that you have behind that like the bonus up PR, I think it's the premium peripheral peripheral nerve p. E. R. Yeah. And I got hit there. So I put my foot to sleep. Just like when Michael Chandler happened to him and bell tours. Same thing. Exactly. You stepping on it. It's just not working. And the pro and the reason I, the reason why everybody kind of got scared. I mean, cause I was, I was hurt, but I remember before the fight, I remember, I remember I saw my cornerman like kind of wait for, I fought the meters. I remember I saw him all. Uh, I saw him on nervous and never see, I remember grabbing my cornerman is team putting them right in front of me. I remember telling us, hey guys, I've been here before.

Speaker 2:          09:27          Like I was ranked 31st in the world. I'd be, I know, I, I, I became a world champion in wrestling. Like guys, like I want you guys to have a little faith in deed, but I'm going to ask you guys one thing and I'm going to ask you guys, I'm going to ask you guys to be composed. I said, the key to winning this fight, this for me to be composed. And then pretty much there's six hours later, they, uh, right before, you know, walk on this are playing my song. I looked back at my corner and I said, uh, and I said, guys, I said, the key to this fight, remember I said it'd be composure. So when Demetrius Johnson kicked me, like I, I believed in my own philosophy, I went back to, all right, my composure because I was hurt Joe. Like he could've stopped me that that first round I was forced to switch south South Paul, which I never fight in south Paul, you know, so now I'm kind of, I worked with me and Demetrius Johnson or playing poker, my whole philosophy and the key to this victory was a composure part.

Speaker 2:          10:21          And uh, when he hit me, I, uh, I really did. I was like, oh my God, not again, not again. I'm not going to last two minutes and 36 seconds. Not Again, but it again, the motivator was not to feel the pain to lose again. Like it wasn't the desire to win. I was like, I just don't want to feel that pain anymore as a competitor, as somebody that, that, that that's on a mission to that sacrifices life. Explaining to someone who's never experienced that before. What is that pain like? You train for how many weeks and then you find mighty mouse with the title. You get stopped in the first round. What is our pain? Oh Man. It's, I think every fighter has a spirit. Like what is the spirit? The spirit is your spirit is your dream. This bird is that, you know, you've watched somebody become a world champion.

Speaker 2:          11:06          You want to be, hey, I want to be just like that guy. Your confidence, your self esteem, that's the, that's your spirit. And you will also, we also have a spirit of a war that's like the man has side of it. And what happens when I got stopped with Demetrius Johnson's to, I almost felt like, and I've never gone through this, not even in wrestling in my life, like I was like, my spirit was shot and I had to kind of pick up my pieces to kind of start healing myself, like mentally. And I feel like it. And if it, and if you look at a job with somebody like Roy Jones, jr he got knocked out one time and it became a domino effect, you know, because he never, he never picked up those pieces. He never started healing that spirit.
