Speaker 1:          00:00          Whatever the fuck they did with Jordan Peterson, they created a god damn monster. Oh yeah, you guys fucked up. What? You guys created a multimillionaire whose worldwide famous and there's a huge bestseller. He was just talking to the Swedish politicians on TV the other day, so you know, watch out. This fucked up with him. Boy did they fuck up and Dave was just texting me a friend. Reuben was just texting me pictures that all full. It's crazy. And that energy and that place is crazy. He's selling out 5,000 seat theaters is a rock star. It's a fucking rock star. He's an intellectual rock rockstar. It's hilarious. Good for him. Yeah. I mean look, a lot of other guys are doing it to Sam Harris is doing that now as well. They do in these gigantic huge speeches. It's like good for him though. Fine. We'll absolutely good for him.

Speaker 1:          00:43          But what I'm excited about is how many people are interested in the debate of ideas and that this is not happening on the college campuses, but a lot of these people that have graduated have graduated from college or you know, or in the working world, they're very fascinated by this. It's real. It's what you were saying, it's been suppressed for long enough now. You know, Jordan Peterson, what was his thing? He was like, you're not going to tell me the words I can use, right. When there's 78 different words for genders, I can safely say you're fucking crazy. It's like this desperation to try to find a unique identity that you can consider it to be super special or whatever. It's totally, but it's, and you want to see you even crazier as you go into the, like you go on these blogs and I think they're mostly on Tumblr or something and it violates my rule.

Speaker 1:          01:31          Never use tumbler. Um, where they talk about the different sexual sexuality identities, like different kinds of, you know, I'm interested in this kind of person, but not this kind of person under these circumstances. But not under those that has like some, you know, 18 syllable academic word for it now. And there's people whose whole, I don't think their academics, I think they're activists geeks on Tumblr, but they come up with these crazy descriptions and there's like hundreds of sexual orientations. Yeah. It's just people wanting to be different, I think sounded be special and they're not good at anything.
