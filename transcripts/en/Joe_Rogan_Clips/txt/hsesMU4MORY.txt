Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience? No, he's not being mean. I wasn't doing racial jokes, like being heavy on racial jokes just cause I was like, I don't fucking know. I don't, I don't care. Like I don't give a shit enough about equality to put my job on the line to try to make everyone, even like I'll, I'll get into nights if it's an all black room. I just do black jokes but not mean, but just what I do. Black jokes. But um, and then you do that. Once you do that, you have a fuck him power of attorney to do anything. Cause even the clean people go my kid's finger, they're asked to write right now and then, and then and then, oh, I'm in pride. Talk to the audience a little. When you were saying that you, um, you used to do a real racist jokes or racial jokes, racial jokes, you know, w you and you stopped doing them because they offended too many people.

Speaker 1:          00:44          No, I never got, no one ever got offended, but I just noticed that I was up for one. I was obsessing on it. I, I would write, I could write all day long. I could write jokes about black people. I mean, if you've sent me, I swear to God, if you put me in a room with a black audience, all I'll do is talk about black people all I'll do. And like now the dirt, the one only the furthest I go is I have a joke about, um, just uh, I go think his racist that they don't make black baby powder. Like I just think that from a company named Johnson and Johnson, they would have thought of that by now. And then they go, you know that, uh, that's home and make $1 million. I'm gonna make back baby powder. And then, uh, and then, and I'll call it magic Johnson and Johnson's.

Speaker 1:          01:24          So then one night there's one, this is great. One night this black dude's, it's, I'm in an audience in Miami goes, hey mother Fucker, when you get done, you put a joke about black baby powder. I'll tell you I don't make shit. And so I was like, I'm think I'm done with the joke now. Like with, why don't they make it? And he goes, we don't have a problem with moisture the way you guys do. He goes, every time I'll hug a white guy, it's like hugging a dolphin. He goes, black people have a problem retaining moisture. So they have a problems getting ashy, so they have to always stay moist. Whereas white people are constantly fucking moist. Whoa. And so he's like, they just never needed black baby powder like people don't use. And I was like, but it was awesome. It was like a great moment.

Speaker 1:          02:07          I love, dude, if I could, if I had a video tape of every experience that I would like to in one of audience, I would be the most famous comic in the world. The, I've hadn't black dudes get on stage in Miami, right? Real Shit. Fucking three gangsters in the front row. True Story. All my children fucking, they're ruining the show for everyone. And I go up and I just talked to them one day. He gets up on stage halfway through my set and he's like, there's, there's a real motherfucker. He's keeping a real, real talk right now. Real talk, you know, real motherfuckers get into three Oh five and he drops his pants and shows his Dick Place goes bananas, right? They're like, whoa. And it's a the biggest blackest. It's almost purple. It's so black like, but as Jack, huge, it's huge. And I'm like, that is real.

Speaker 1:          02:48          That is fucking real. And then I'm out bugging month nine inches and it's a, it's a, it's a show or it's like a thick, thick, thick and uncircumcised. Just looking at it like, Holy Shit. So then I go, I go, man, that's fucking, his name was ray. I don't know why I remember that. But I'm like, Ray, I go, I think you might want to get off stage because I can guarantee you you're, they're calling the cops right now and I don't want you to go to jail for just showing your Dick. He's like, I appreciate that. Good looking out. And then he puts his pants on and leave. So then I go, man, how do you follow that? Another gang, gangbangers stands up, gets on stage. I go, please tell me. We're seeing another cock right now. Pulls his pants down, bugging justice, big but lighter, lighter, like a lighter brown.

Speaker 1:          03:30          And I'm like, Holy Shit. I'm like, and I was like, you might want to go catch up with breaks. I guarantee you they're calling the cops now. So they're sitting with, I swear to you, all my children, they're sitting with inherit a hairless albino. Okay. And I said, and now and now that the crowd is like fucking in a fevered pitch. I go, that's funny. Out of all the Dicks, I wanted to see what was yours. He stands up, gets on stage, takes his dick out and it looks like a light house. No grass, right white and the PO, they're flipping over fucking tables now. Fucking going nuts. And I was like, Ladies and gentlemen, that's my show.

Speaker 1:          04:08          Oh, I literally followed that. You can't follow that. Can't follow it. I literally, and I've white glow in the dark Casper that goes, Dick Hall was, it was beautiful and it was big. It was big. I swear to you. It was big. And I was like, oh, I was like fucking. And then, and then they all waited for me out at the bar and they were like, dude, we taking you out. And I was like, this doesn't end this way. I love when he, when he bombs there is so rare. He's really fucking funny man. It's like when it's like when you shoot a bear with a bow and Arrow, but they don't know they've been injured yet, but they know there has to be shot with a bow and arrow. I watched a lot of hunting. I watched a lot of hunting videos like I used to.

Speaker 1:          04:45          I used to, if I, if I ever got too fucked up within, I'd watch hunting in Florida, it's very easy to get really bear bear hunting from, in my opinion, you've done it. I've never done it. But all the videos are, they like put a box out full of food and then they'd sit in a tent and then the bear would come out and they shoot it with a bow and Arrow and the bear would get hit, but it would almost feel, it would seem like the bear be like, ow, what the fuck was that? And then you'd see the look in the bear's face where they'd be like, I don't feel good. I'm going to go rest for a little bit. That's how so girl looks, when he bombs, it's like, it's like, he's like, he like, he looks at you like, did I get, I get hit?

Speaker 1:          05:18          And you're like, and you're, and you know, he's been hit by an arrow. My favorite one was in, uh, in, in, uh, in Pearl Harbor. Me, Tahara, Hawaii, me, Thompson, [inaudible] and Russell Peters. And, uh, I go up and I do okay, but maybe I was dirtier than I should have been. That's totally fine because the only rules were don't make fun of the Hawaiians. That was it. Don't make fun of the Hawaiians and don't bring up Pearl Harbor. What? Tom's opening joke. He's like, man, it's a lot of fat people. He's like, I heard island life was slow, but I didn't know they were talking about their metabolism. So then it says I got lost walking around. Luckily a Japanese guy pointed out the directions man, those Japanese, no, this place like the back of their hand. I mean he bumps so hard that when he got off he was like that early sweats like where you could and he's like, he's like, who are pretty good and you're like, you might want to go back to your nest and raw.

Speaker 1:          06:11          You know Tom's going to lose his shit. That video of where I'm shaving Tom that that week? Yeah, for after the show. Before how many shows did you guys do? One? Just one. Just one. I went up, I was a little dirty. I think Tom went up, had a rough set. He kind of want him back. You know Tom is not right for corporate gig in that opinion in there's a corporate gig for the, it was like maybe I want to say 3000 people on at Pearl Harbor sitting in lawn chairs with their families. What was the Gig like? What, who is it for? For the Pearl. For the USO. Ah, that's on, that's a military guy. Yes. Corporate Kid. That same same energy. So I and so then Tom sits next to me. This is my favorite part. Thompson texted me and Russell Peters comes on stage and you can hear there's a murmuring now mind you, we're at war with Iraq and Russell Peters is a little brown for their taste and Tom goes, I never realized he looks like the enemy.

Speaker 1:          07:07          And Russell Peters is by the way, didn't acknowledge it did had a great set but you could hear that kind of like they brought up one of the like and Tom and I were in the back like this is bad. We the next day you thought it was bad because he was brown. It was only because we had gone to rifle training the day before and Russell had randomly chose not to go randomly. And the first words that rifle training was, there's one rule here. If it's Brown, it moves, you kill it. And Rob and Tom was like, thanks guys, you didn't bring rough. Let the fuck. Imagine if you're Mexican and you're in the fucking army and they tell you that shit. If it's brown and it moves, we kill it. Whoa. That guy said that. And we brought our wives to it. We we've had arrives to rifle, we shot every gun they had.

Speaker 1:          07:51          We brought our wives and the girls were like, right before we went, stepped in and they go, can we go to the bathroom? Or like, yeah, go to the bathroom. So we walk in and the guy's like, uh, I thought they were going to be six. He's like a real military guy. And we're like, yeah, the girls went to the bathroom. It was okay. And then Tom goes, hey, do me a favor. When they get in, act a little like aggressive to them and misogynistic. And let's just see the looks on their faces. So the girls walk in and he was on, well, typical lady's got lost. Don't know what time it is. If their man's not next to him. And Christina and my wife started bubbling like what the, and he's like, ladies do follow the men don't know what to do there, you gentlemen.

Speaker 1:          08:27          And he got into character so good that Tom stepped in. He's like, it's a joke. Everybody hits a joke. He's doing it because we asked him to. This guy was good. Wow. That's funny. Yeah. That's hilarious. That's funny that you can get a trained killer just to crack jokes. Oh, the guy was, it was, it was a really fun trip. If it's Brown, kill it. If it's Brown and it moves you kill it. The gumption or the gregariousness to break in in the when you're doing sets or was it, I was, I don't even know what the fuck I was doing. I was working out at Barnes and noble. So you were working at Barnes and noble? No, working out. Working out. Uh, this is bad. You do sets of bonds? No. What was working at Barnes and noble and then working out during the day and the basement.

Speaker 1:          09:09          Like I was fucking, I got fired from partisan Nova. This is the worst. I was working at Barnes and noble and astro place. No fucking AC. And so everyday I would you ever have a job where you lift boxes and as you do you're like that's not a bad but a good buy workout and you're like, oh all right I'll do a little bit of this. And if I do this all day long and I'm fucking jacked buys by the end of the summer. So I'd go down to the basement and you could take the freight elevator, I'm going to sound like a psycho into five minutes. You can take the freight elevator to the basement and no one could get down there cause you had the elevator. And so once I got to the basement, I take off my clothes and start working out and just like do pushups, sit ups, fucking curls with boxes, whole books out into fucking these fucking jobs, front rows.

Speaker 1:          09:49          And I work out. And then it was, there was no AC. So then I'd wait till I cooled down, put all my clothes back on, getting the freight elevator walk up and I just killed like 30 minutes. When you have a job like that to kill 30 minutes is a, it's like fucking calm that much closer to being over done. So I'm like, this is an eating rip fuel to remember ritual pop in fucking three refuels every three hours, right? Oh my God. Like a tweaker running around Shelvin travel books. Go down to the basement, pounding like I'm in fucking Oz and then come up sweating like a motherfucker with a name tag on. Just, uh, and so like two weeks into it, my boss Duane pulls me aside and he was like, he was like, Hey man, you've been spending a lot of time in the basement. And I was like, Oh yeah, cause I got to get travel books. And that's where we keep them all down there. And he's like, yeah, do you know we have video cameras?

Speaker 1:          10:36          I was like, I didn't know that. He's like, you're fucking fired. And I was like, wow. I did Duane, I can explain to you is no I can't, I can't have someone getting into their underwear basement working out, doing they should be working and then coming back up and then interacting with people and I was trying to be a comic so I was trying to think alternatively and I'm on speed, which is Kim. So theoretically like I would do funny shit but it was crazy if you didn't know me exactly. Some guy told you the day we were doing a promo shoot for HDTV and I did a joke at the end of the day, like it was that funny. He goes, Bert, everything you do is only funny if you've spent fucking 24 hours with you. And so yeah. So I got fired and then came home would be great to have that tape if anyone at Barnes and noble.

Speaker 1:          11:21          And so his name is Dwayne. I remember he asked me if I wanted to be a manager like a week before that and I was like, no. And it was like, what? And I was like, he was like, you don't want to be manager. And I was like, no. He's like, why? Why do you w w what do you want to do? Then I was like, I want to be a comedian. And I was like, oh, this isn't what I do. And he looked at me dead in the face. He goes, this is what you do. This is who you are. You work at Barnes and noble. Don't think you're better than us. You're not. Fuck, I'm out of here soon. I didn't know I was going to get fired, but don't think you're better than us at Burke Chrysler was telling when I smell. Might be one of the great stories.

Speaker 1:          11:55          No Dad, no. He used to shit his pants all the time. All the time. How long would you said the story began with you saying that he shit his pants in a banana republic in Beverly Hills and uh, it was, it was like real, it was like the real coming of age part of my life when my dad looked at me and he was like, buddy, I'm about to shit my pants. What do I do? We use the word, it's not the, here's where public have a bathroom, here's the fucking worst part of it, right? So I look at him and I go to shit, your pants dad, I think you shit your pants and I go, Shit your pants a little bit and then walk as far as you can and get to your hotel. And he just left. My daughter's with me like fucking drop them and was like, I'm fucking know yet.

Speaker 1:          12:31          And so we started walking down Rodeo or whatever, you know, Burton, one of those roads to get to his hotel, right? So my mom comes up and she's like, she's like, where's your dad? And I said, oh, he left me this sweater, I got to buy it for, I'm bought them, ended up buying them the sweater and he, I go, he had to shit his pants. She goes, what do you mean he had he shit his pants. I go, we ended, she had to shit. So he shit his pants and then he just, he's walking on the street. I go, I'm sure we can catch him. He's walking slow. And then my wife comes up, she goes, where's your dad? And I go, he shit his pants. She goes, why didn't you just use the bathroom? I said, where's the bathroom? She goes downstairs and I went, Ooh, I probably should have told him that and so I don't know.

Speaker 1:          13:04          I was in panic mode. It was black Friday and I'm waiting in line too when I got a leather jacket on sale, but it's even worse I think if you shit your pants in line for the bathroom because then everybody's going to know if there's a big line of people that you just is dumping your pants, then you're like close proximity. No way to play off shitting your pain when you shit your pants. I say this shitting your pants is a lot like getting a Dui. You roll the dice so much and get away with it that when you do get caught with your hand and cookie jar, you're like mother fucker and then she never thought that was going to happen. Are you kidding me?

Speaker 1:          13:37          Why today? Oh, that's so true. When his thirties he was running marathons and he used to shoot his pants all the time. Not even like, I'm not even saying like, I'm not even saying like, oh once a month, I'm talking once a week he would, this is before cell phones too. He was in his thirties he was in his thirties I was a, I was a kid. We were living in, in like North Tampa, not in like the nicer north Tampa, but in the Shittier redneck verse, Black North Tampa. And a first time I ever heard her, the n word was in this neighborhood, but my dad used to run marathons so we'd run like five miles, 10 miles and you can go out and on these 10 mile runs, he shit his pants. So he go into these orange groves, shit himself, right. Clean himself the best he could and then run home.

Speaker 1:          14:17          But there were some nights, I remember these distinctly, it was before cell phones were it get dark and my mom's like, we got to go look for your dad. And we'd be driving his route where he'd run all of a sudden like a naked happening. My Dad would come out of the fucking orange groves like, I'm here, give me in the car right now. If he knew who he come get him. Oh, he just would. Yeah, it would be. I remember thundering lightning and he's just sitting in an orange grove naked. Like how did he shit his pants and, and we'd be like over here and he'd be like, all right, and you just hop in the front seat, go home, let's go. Like real quick shit. His pants. He hates my stories. I hope someone, if anyone is listening to this, knows my dad. Let him listen to this because every fucking story I ever tell he fucking Oise goes, God damn, you're fucking imagination.

Speaker 1:          15:01          Not how I would fuck I did not shit my pants. I Shit a little bit. I didn't Shit My, you're making people digging shit my pants. He just squirts. He says a little squirter. I Dunno, let's call him on the phone. Do it just, I didn't even go lucid, like I didn't try to control it or move around. I just let the dream play out, but I realize it was a dream and I still didn't wake up. I have, that's a rare thing for me. Pills just for that. Chef dreams. I have dreams, I have fucking crazy dreams, but I am totally lucid inside my dreams. Like I'll dreams that I'm reading something and I'll go, I'll be going to go. Wow, that's so funny that I'm reading something because nothing's there in the dream. All Pink. This nothing's there in my mind is making up these words, but I'm still reading them. That's so interesting. I had a dream one time that me and Elvis walked into his hotel room and there were four dudes,

Speaker 2:          15:44          but fucking right. Hear me where they were.

Speaker 1:          15:48          Just that might be one of the best sentences ever created. I had a dream that I was with Elvis and we walked into his dressing room. There was four dudes, but fucking dot, dot, dot. Now hear me out

Speaker 2:          16:02          it weird or they're throwing up in Burger King Cups just fucking each other. And then I do you. When I say this, I fucking just shut the door and I looked at Elvis. I go, what the fuck's going on in your room? He said to me, what's your Dream Baby Shit? I wake up, I wake up. I'm like, wake up, check my and make sure it's, I'm bored. I'm like, well, you really flipped me out. You don't really flip me out. Not that the guys were both fucking right that find me. No. It was the product placement. Like what the fuck did Burger King do to get in there? How the fuck fucking dream? They

Speaker 1:          16:45          figured it out and you just don't know that they is way to interject advertising into your dreams. Burger King in the future. Right now it's like I got her Chrysler stream about the Elvis and the Butt fucking high, Huh? No, no, no, no. But what is, there's a possibility that someone could insert a product to a dream, right? They could give you a cheeseburger and in that cheeseburger with some experimental thing that would make you think about burger king in a dream and see a burger and a dream, you can do it. You could do it. I fucking curl from behind. It's going Geico and shit. Yes, in the future. But that doesn't make any sense cause he of Pronto duck noises. It's Geico. You have to eat something to have this happen to you. We're still, we're still missing the whole black. We're stumbling on something very brilliant right now.

Speaker 1:          17:30          Can we get to the flag bill those first cause we might forget. Yes. Okay. Klein dildos. Here we go. So I called Joe. This is what you said. You Go, we were just talking about this dude like yeah, you've got so many crazy stories that have happened to you and it and, and, but I never think that, I think there are just things in my life. I think it's my ability, the way I see something happen is different than the way everyone else sees it happen. You know? I see the, the little thing that that registers in me, I go all, that's my thing, you know, and it lights up for me where my wife just glazes over it and it's come to light in this podcast more than anything. The machine, I mean, the way I've told the story to fucking a million people, but then when I told him to do something lit up and I went, oh, that is a good story, right?

Speaker 1:          18:06          The fucking fighting a bear, the fuck everything. I'm getting mauled by a bull, Tracy Morgan, everything's lights up. So then I'm talking on the phone today. I call you, Hey, can you do by I and you go. I said, I'm on the phone with Delta American Airlines trying to get upgraded. And you're like, where are you going? I said, Amsterdam.
