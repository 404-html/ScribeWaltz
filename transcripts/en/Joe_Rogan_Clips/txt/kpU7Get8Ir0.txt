Speaker 1:          00:00          From the animal level to the plant level, to the fungal level. You find these things everywhere. Um, you know, um, and people say, well, there's about 150 species of plants that contain DMT. That's only because we've only looked at 150 species of plants. You know, if you look at these large genera that are, that are, you know, famous known for having tryptamines like Acacias and my most and on these things, uh, we know of a few species that have DMT, but there's hundreds of species, thousands of species. It's just that nobody's looked, nobody's going to fund this work. I think you can reasonably say that, you know, there are about 1400 species of Acacia in the world. Probably 75% of them have DMT. And actually I would go to the next, I would, I would even claim without evidence. That's never stopped me before. But I think it's reasonable to suppose that because DMT is so close to mainstream metabolism, probably all plants have DMT to some extent.

Speaker 1:          01:10          Most don't have large, large levels of it. They don't have useful amounts of DMT. But if you took with sufficient instruments, if you just started ranting randomly sampling plants and analyzing for DMT with the Mass Spec, I'll bet it would turn up and almost everything. What is a, which is it? Filovirus grass. It's toxic to sheep because that's CMT. Yup. That's the one. So the DMT in it for whatever reason, way it interacts with the sheeps digestive system, it becomes poisoned. The, well, no, not entirely. I mean it's got Phil Harris Grass has DMT. It has five methoxy DMT. Other trip to means. It also has something called Grameen, which has a, it's like DMT with only one carbon on the side chain. Grameen is more or less toxic. Graming shows up in a lot of grass species. That's probably the thing that causes what's called FileVault staggers. So if you just fed DMT a synthesized to sheep, it wouldn't be toxic.

Speaker 1:          02:17          Hard to say. Did they produce monoamine oxidase? Nobody's done it to shape. Yeah, of course. So do leopards or jaguars all mammals. So when you see those jaguars eating the leaves and then tripping their balls off, rolling around in their back, what do you think is happening there? You've seen those videos. I've seen, I've seen those videos. Well for one thing, many rare eating, uh, banisteriopsis right, which is the source of the Mao inhibitors. Right. And I don't know what to make of that. It certainly does seem like some kind of a catnip for them and caused us an altered state for Mao inhibitors in, in and of themselves. They produce some sort of a psychedelic experience. Uh, they can, um, not just from the Mao inhibition, but they often have other effects that are psychoactive, like harm, harming Armenia is a good example. You know, we used to think that harming was basically, it's the Mao inhibitor and Iowaska and then doesn't do a whole lot beyond that.

Speaker 1:          03:19          Well, it turns out now harming this, getting a second look. It's interesting that the tar mean, uh, you know, was discovered in began, I'm Harlow about maybe 10 years before Iowasca was ever reported to science. So harming is one of these hoary old alkaloids. I like to call it, you know, it's been known forever and now we're just finding out it has all sorts of interesting pharmacology's it's it, it's an Mao inhibitor for sure. More importantly, it appears that it stimulates neural genesis and that's relevant to Alzheimer's and brain development. And even down syndrome. It is an inhibitor of this kinase, this regulatory protein called Dyr k one which has got its fingers in lots of different cellular pies. You could pile it many different regulatory, uh, functions. And harming is a very potent, very selector inhibitor of this kinase. So that's relates to this.

Speaker 1:          04:25          It actually stimulates nerve growth in the hippocampus. So, uh, you know, we're, and, and we're finding out that there are a number of other receptors that it interacts with, including Serotonin, dopamine transporters, even one called the imagine lean receptors that are, uh, you know, of undefined functions. So like most natural molecules, it's not a one trick pony, you know, um, harming has a number of effects, you know, and that's why taking Iowasca is a different, you know, it, that's why it's not a pure DMT experience. Cause you've got a whole mixture of alkaloids that are, that are contributing to that effect. Who were the researchers that when they discovered harming, they didn't know what it was and they'd try to label it telepathy mean to, they realize that it was harming. Right, right. Well yeah, this is part of the, uh, what you may call the, the, the, the sad and sordid history of the, of Iowasca.

Speaker 1:          05:36          Yeah. In a certain way because in the early days, in the 20s, when people are looking at it, um, a number of independent groups, we're working on it. And they were identified, they were isolated molecules. They weren't aware of other people's work. And so they misnamed these things. Know, I mean, uh, I can't tell you exactly, I think initially it was Louis Lewin who discovered, um, uh, are mean and he called it bend the story. And then that turned out, well, another group years before had isolated the same molecule from began I'm Hormel and telepathy in was one of these misnomers that came out. The problem with with this was that back in the day people didn't collect voucher specimens. So a lot of this chemical work was done without the benefit of her barium specimens, which now every everybody that wants to do fido chemical work hopefully has the, the good sands to collect specimens of the original Platte so that people can go back and look at that.

Speaker 1:          06:46          A lot of this early work was reported and there was no voucher specimens to document the collection. So a lot of it had to be dismissed, you know, uh, they cut the Beta carbon lean chemistry of banisteriopsis didn't really get well defined until, um, some Chinese scientists, uh, or at least they had Chinese name worked on them and discovered harming tetra hydro harming and the harmer lien as the main alkaloids. They could reference that to botanical voucher specimens. So they really should get the credit for discovering it. And then once that was done, then it was known. And you know, other scientists had to acknowledge that. Why did they describe it as telepathy? There was supposedly some sort of a story about some group telepathic experience. Yeah. This was just romantic. This was just some story, you know, out of the literature. Um, yeah. I mean, I mean it, it was rumored to be able to cause telepathy, but this wasn't Iowasca they were only taking hormone.

Speaker 1:          07:58          It's not clear. It's not clear. It's not clear. Yeah. I mean they may have been taken but they may have been taking it, but whether they were getting telepathy, I kind of doubt it when we know we could get telepathy on Iowasca. It's not so uncommon. It happens all the time. People have group hallucinations, group visions. Has anybody ever bothered to independently like sequester people, put them into like different rooms, have them do Iowasca and then have them describe a very similar experience are almost identical experience to prove that these telepath he experiences exist or at least to as far as I know that hasn't been done. See, yeah. Cause everybody wants to talk afterwards. It's like I do see the dragon. Right. I don't think that's been done. That seems like a worthy study. Cause if, if I've heard from more than one person, uh, in fact my friend Kyle Kingsbury and his wife

Speaker 2:          08:56          had an Iowaska experience with a, both had a visualization of their child and then when they got back she was pregnant and they want to having this child from their visualization from, from, from this experience. Um, obviously they're very close and they were together and they probably communicated quite a bit. And, you know, I would just think it'd be really interesting experiment.

Speaker 1:          09:20          It would be very interesting. I mean, and that sort of points out there is, you know, a realm of experience, a realm of knowing that these things give access to that's normally close to us. I mean, that's kind of a trivial statement of course. Um, but then you get down to questions of how verifiable is that? How real is that? How uh, you know, and, and people get, um, I don't know if the term is hung up, but they can get baffled when you start talking about, you know, the reality of say the entities you encounter on DMT. I mean this is, this is uh, some people I know are obsessed with trying to verify the reality of the entities that you find on DMT. And again, it comes down to if you experienced some, they're real. Yeah. If anything you experienced is real because you've experienced it, does it have a corresponding existence in the external world?

Speaker 1:          10:27          Well, you know, what's external? Let's internal, you know, we, we, we throw around these terms, these, these epistomological metaphysical terms quite carelessly, you know, without really thinking about it. What does it mean when you say I'm in here and you're out there, you know, and then you take a psychedelic and you realize that start official boundary, you know, we're all one, there is no separation. It's separate in normal consciousness though it's separated in normal conscious. But then what is normal conscious if not a reflection of year neurochemical brain state. I mean, everything you experience is an altered state because it's filtered into this brain processed by the brain and you know, the brain is a biochemical engine that, you know, as I say, often

Speaker 2:          11:18          we're made out of drugs, but it seems that our normal consciousness is the best state to propagate biological life and to keep our, our whatever we've created in terms of our community structures and relationships and friendships and the ability to build structures and houses and things like that. These, all these things are done best when you're here and present. Whereas when you're on a psychedelic state, I agree with you. Well, the way I've always described it as, if you had a meeting with God and you went and God gave you all the answers to the world, you, you experienced, uh, undeniable beauty in the most extreme form possible where you couldn't have imagined it and then you came back whether you hallucinated it or not, it's the exact same experience. Exactly. I can't put it on a scale. You can't weigh it. You can't, like we've stretched the tape measure around and God is 47 inches across like just because, you know what I'm saying? Just because you can't draw and measure it with what we term our, our, our, you know, our metrics for reality.

Speaker 1:          12:25          Right? And that is exactly the, the thing. Don't worry about whether it's real and the way we would define real. Is it good information or is it bad air, is it not? That's the thing. It doesn't matter where it comes from it, it's such a fits good information. Then it has its own internal validity of whether it came from some part of yourself that is normally obscurity. You or it came from the plant teacher or the aliens transmitting it through.

Speaker 2:          12:56          It doesn't really matter. But we, we are obsessed with that. We are in reality because we think we're being fooled a lot. Right? Like, and this goes back to Terrance's Lacera era, a psychedelic experience where he had a Ufo encounter. The easily dismissing amongst us would go while he's tripping his balls off on mushrooms. Of course I saw you. Oh, is there a leprechaun drive in the UFO? Like all that's nonsense, right, right.

Speaker 1:          13:23          Easy to dismiss. Yeah. And in fact, that is the nature of these phenomena. That's what's really interesting, easy to dismiss. You know, that that was another aspect of the experiment of the La Truro I left out when I was talking about my lecture. But there's almost always an element of absurdity in these experiences and in paranormal experiences. In UFO encounters, it's like little green men. Yeah. Are you kidding? But right. The fuck there are little green man and little blue man. You know, a guy you should, uh, have on the show. Maybe you have already, uh, is uh, Whitley Strieber.

Speaker 2:          14:05          No, I haven't had them on, but he's so out to lunch. Um, I have massive reservations. There's a video of him looking at a fly in that flow. Clearly a fly flies in front of a camera and he's describing it as this a man in a suit and it's like, like there's something wrong with him.

Speaker 1:          14:25          Well, I missed that. I missed that part. I think what's interesting about Whitley and I agree, I, I totally dismissed him, you know, for a long time I thought, you know, he is really a nutcase.

Speaker 2:          14:38          He's from the communion books where people don't know exactly what a series of books about being abducted and yeah, but

Speaker 1:          14:46          I sort of have to change my opinion somewhat because, and uh, um, uh, Jeffrey cry poll, who I do know, is it Jeffrey Cripe bill is a professor of comparative religion and mythology at Rice University. And his focus initially is sort of on the, the Superhero as, as in contemporary, uh, you know, mythology as a mythical figure on that sort of thing. He, and, uh, I was invited to, uh, a simple, uh, you know, a workshop that Whitley was going to be at. This was a couple of years ago in Hawaii. While I'm always interested in a free trip to Hawaii, right? So I said, I, you know, I like to come to this thing, but this guy is a nut case. I'm not sure I want to appear on the same stage with this guy. I mean, if it's me, say that, you know, he said that cancer and, and um, you know, and, and the, the guy who was hosting it said, well, you know, did you know that he and Jeffrey Cripple wrote a book together?

Speaker 1:          15:54          And I said, oh, I don't, I said that, I know Jeffrey cry bill. I know that he's not on that case. And that's interesting. And then I found out about the book and I said, I, I told the guy, if you invite Jeffery and Whitley, then all come and we'll participate. The name of the book is a supernatural two word, supernatural, a new vision of the unexplained. And it's really very interesting. Um, the book is basically, you know, alternating chapters. Whitley tells us stories about what happened to it and what has happened to and what continues to happen to him. He lives in some kind of alternate reality. I I t I get that. I mean, I don't know if I accept it, but I get it. And then in alternating chapters, Jeffrey comes along and kind of unpacks this and, and explains where does this fit into sort of the, the, you know, phenomenology of mythology and, you know, reasonable explanations.

Speaker 1:          16:59          And, uh, and it's a fascinating book. If you just suspend disbelief for a minute, think about, assume that Whitley's is sincere. I don't think he's lying. I think that these things really happened to him or he thinks they do. And some of the most craziest things, these are not, you know, the media has made like everything, they dumb it down, you know, and they put it into the box of alien encounters. Guys, a nutball, uh, you know, and they dismiss it. But if you take a culture look, one thing to Whitley's credit is he doesn't claim to understand what's happening. He doesn't call it an alien encounter. He does, doesn't play me anything. He just says this is happening. I have no frigging idea what is, what this is. So that's all honest. You know, that's an honest scientific stance. I do not understand this phenomenon.

Speaker 1:          17:58          So I give him credit for that. And then he, and, and Jeffrey wrote this book. There was a very interesting, uh, you know, later on, so I read all this later on in the book, there's a chapter where they get to what is the possible physical explanation of what's going on here. If there is a physical explanation and one of the headings, I think the chapter one of the headings and the chapter was labeled the soul as a Ufo. And that kind of blew my mind. That got my attention. Because, you know, when I did this, this workshop with them, I was kind of bringing the flag of psychedelics, right. And I was saying, if you don't aggress psychedelics, you've only got part of the picture here. And uh, and they, and they were talking about how the soul, how this could be some sort of a physical plaza moy type of thing.

Speaker 1:          18:57          They were in woking, you know, scientific terminology. I don't know if it was, it was legitimate or not, but just the idea of the soul of a Ufo. And I was able to respond to that and say, well, you know, the experiment at La Chorrera was essentially the blueprints of how to build one of these things that you're talking about, you know, which it was really this, this transformation. And so that was, that impressed me. I don't know what to make of it. That I think, I think there is, and they don't really know. Nobody knows what to make of it, but I think they're just odd things going on. Um, but that some people experience yes. And uh, and whether they are actual encounters or dreams or somewhere in between. I'm not sure. It would be cool. It would be good. I mean, yeah. I don't know. I mean, when you, when you, when you meet with Lee, have you ever met him? No. He is like the most drab person you could imagine. I mean, he's like an accountant.

Speaker 2:          20:12          It's probably worn out from telling all these stories worn out. Yeah. It could be. Could be. But he was, but he was a fiction writer. He was a fiction writer. And then he comes out with this incredible real world story. But he reads like fiction and I, there's obviously something off when you talk to him or you hear him. I've never talked to him personally, but when you see him in interviews and conversations, there's something off you now. What is that something off? Is it a psychotic break? Is it something that drifts in and out? Is does he, is he having problems with normal? I mean I don't, I don't know what it is, but I'd thought I'm really needing to find that video of him talking about the fly. Did you find it? Oh thanks. The flies, a man and a fucking space suit.

Speaker 2:          20:59          He's like, it's not a man in a suit. What is that? And I'm like, oh Jesus. Two with lunch called the bed with quite a few of those. There's quite a few really bizarre videos of him. He like, he's having a hard time with normal reality. So which would make sense during the dream state cause all of these things are happening at night. Right, right, right. This was the, this is the big thing that I've always, the big problem I've always had about these UFO abduction experiences. First of all, they all take place when someone is either, uh, at night. It's either they're on a dark road where there's no one around and they're sleepy or they're at home and their bed, like the vast majority of them take place at night or while someone's lying in bed, which is exactly when you're dreaming. Right now we don't totally understand the dream state, but we, there's, there's a connection, at least an implied connection between psychedelic chemicals that your brain produces endogenously that could be released during the dream state and in different levels with different humans.

Speaker 2:          22:01          I mean, obviously some people have problems with producing serotonin and dopamine and then other people have no problems with it. And this biology of the human brain varies, right? Right. So it's not without considerate or it's not without possibility that there's someone who has a real issue with these chemicals just busting through. Right. Flooding their, there are, yeah. Oh wait, no, there are people. I've then does this mental illness, but then does this contradicts what we've already said about psychedelic experiences? Like why would we diminish his indogenous psychedelic experience if that's what he's having? I mean, it is entirely possible that you're dealing with someone who may be perhaps does have some sort of psychotic breaks, but also is experiencing psychedelic experiences due to some endogenous DMT dump or dump of whatever. And all these things are taking place at the same time in the dream state during heavy rem sleep and he's coming back with his uniform stories of alien abduction.

Speaker 1:          23:01          Yeah, no, I agree. It's, it's, uh, I mean it's hard to Parse it out and I'm not saying I accepted all, but I, uh, it's easy to dismiss, but maybe you shouldn't write. Well there may be, is something there we should approach it in the spirit of here's a phenomenon, right? We don't understand that. We shouldn't dismiss it. There's something to be understood here. Not necessarily his understanding of it, but something to be looked at there. And I thought this book was interesting for its balance. You know, I would not have Whitley Strieber on your show without Jeffrey cry. Yeah. Show. That was the thing. Cause he, it would be fun and maybe it's, you know, maybe it's a bridge too far and I'm not sure. Yeah. Maybe then maybe we get to the bottom of this thing. Yeah. Well, is there something to be got to the bottom right? That's where a bottom at all, just one man's delusion or is there really something at the base of it.
