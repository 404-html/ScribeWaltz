Speaker 1:          00:00          In no matter what anybody wanted to say about how good the movie was, what the critics say, anybody in this business, if you can do something where it goes from a thought and it goes to the paper and you can execute it, how many motherfuckers can do that? They don't do that. People talk shit all the motherfucking time. But then you say, how many have you got an can yo, I'm right movies, give me a strip. Oh hold on, hold on. I'm almost 30 pages in. You know what I'm saying? How many times you that story, why are they going on? I got it. I've got a great idea. All right, what is it? I remember I was just with Chappelle show was popping and ludicrous gave me a lesson out of nowhere. I saw many airport and I was on Ashy, Larry Hart. I was I rich bitch man.

Speaker 1:          00:45          So I'm like doing reference like we're even right. So ludicrous. I was like, Yo Luda right. He said, what's up Ashley? I said, I said Yo, kill a motherfucker getting a movie or something cause I just thought that's what you do. You just add some motherfucker. I like it a month I get a movie or something and he looked at me, Joe, it was so cold. He looked me right in my face. He said, we look for people with ideas and I looked to him like, well, I have none, right? So I guess this is this conversation and it did and when I'm telling you it was a lesson, how the fuck you want to ask somebody for something and you don't got shit to give them? A lot of guys in the beginning think that's how you do it. That's how he did when I was on HBO is the wires.

Speaker 1:          01:31          Motherfucker told me one time, he said, Yo d can you give me the number to the wire? I think I could do this shit. This motherfucker what the day was like a hotline from anybody from the streets. Do you ever thought about being an actor? You don't want to put those 10 years of getting rejected. Just call this number and we'll put you on the wire. You know, what gets me about acting though is when someone has never acted before, it goes in there and kills it. You know, like people who are like the athletes in particular, like rappers have done it. Like a lot of people have done it, but some people, but some people I believe that that, do you have natural talents? Yeah.
