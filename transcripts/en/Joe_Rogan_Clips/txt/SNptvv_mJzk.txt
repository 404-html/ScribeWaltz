Speaker 1:          00:00          Zest. Chad Johnson. He always eats Mcdonald's and he's doing it. Yeah. While he's working out right here. Yeah. Yeah Dude, you can do that. Yeah. It's all in how much you exercise with them. Now that's not easy. Obviously he's eating healthy food on top of that, but if he feels like fucking off and getting a big Mac, he could do that. And there's no, no performance benefits, right? Nope. No penalty. You can do it. So when Floyd does that, he is doing that. He really is eating that nuts. Is Chad still working out? Yeah, he does. He do. Just for Jack Exercise, just for fun. He fucking loves it. 22 miles an hour. It's his comedy. What does he do these days? So what he'll do is, I mean he'll like play guys and like play guys and FIFA online. He's a great follow on Twitter.

Speaker 1:          00:44          It's hilarious. Oh yeah. I follow them. It's like hit like a girl. We'll post a picture and then he'll say what's wrong with the picture? She'll be smoking high and be like, yeah, but your shades at $30. Like, you know, don't put so much money into your outfit when the blinds in your house or $30. Like he'll just nitpick a little things like, dude, he's hilarious. But his, um, my guesstimation is, um, this is his comedy. Like remember you're saying? Yeah. Yeah. He used to sleep at the arena or at least at, at the stadium.

Speaker 1:          01:15          He, when he played, he was obsessed with it. He loved the sport. He was talking about fighting Anderson Silva at one time. No, no, no. He's crazy. He's talking about finance, football player, coffee Anderson when he was in his prime. I think he has martial arts skill though. I'm not bullshitting south by is actually he's got for him hitting the pads are hitting the bag. Yeah. Cause I think he has real martial arts skill, like legit martial arts. But that's the question. It's like when are these elite athletes going to enter MMA? Damn. Well they are, but in small, who's the small numbers? Well, Jon Jones is absolutely an elite athlete, but he's got a 20 inch vertical.

Speaker 2:          01:53          Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:54          yeah, how elite he did. He's got small calves, but the fact that he has all small cows allows him to be six foot four and 205 pounds. Right. You're saying he was bottom heavy. He'd be two 50. He'd be a different way, which she could be, by the way. He could be a heavyweight. He could bulk up and go up to heavyweight, but he's got like weird calf genetics is calves are tiny. Right. The thing is you don't have to jump that much in MMA and he can hit you in the face with a flying knee. But the, what he knows how to do and what he can do physically in terms of his wrestling and his ability to close the distance and smash guys at time. People, he's an elite athlete. I think he could, he could have done that. He's his two brothers play NFL. Here he is. It's Chad sparring a little bit. He's in blue, right? Yeah. Still can't be touched. He says, well, he's a southpaw, so

Speaker 1:          02:50          let's see this stay away from Anderson Silva, so he's full. Okay, let's good. Good habits. Good head movement. Yeah, for sure. I liked the way he moves hands down over ridiculous. So he does the duty sparring though. We don't know shit about him. That guy might be terrible. Yeah. You know, I mean the guy didn't want to try to go to the body. He didn't duck in and when someone's moving their head around like that just smashed the ribs. You go right after this gloss of the arms. Yeah. Hit those arms. So they tried to do with Floyd man. Yeah. Good luck. Good luck. Flaws in the game that no flaws. The flaws. One thing, it's like we were talking about with Ben Aspirin that when a guy's a super elite wrestler, you think you're going to do something but he knows you think you're going to do something.

Speaker 1:          03:38          So he does it. You do what you were going to do, he anticipates what you're going to do. He has an answer to that and then you have to regroup and he's already moving on to step three. It's just too many steps ahead of you. Can there be a guy like with him that you don't engage on the ground? Like you just kind of Jab, stay on the outside. God. Yeah, for sure. Look, Robbie Lawler, uh, almost took Ben Aspirin out in his last fight and it was Ben's mental toughness and his ability to endure punishment. Most guys would have probably gone unconscious there. Yeah, but style bender, like a guy style bender would be one of the worst fucking nightmares for a guy like Ben ask him cause he's super difficult to take down and on the feet. He's not going to do anything stupid. You're going to move forward and try to grab ahold of the thing and you're just gonna eat knuckle sandwich after knuckle sandwich and he's going to slowly chop at your legs.

Speaker 1:          04:27          Wack. Yeah. And you're going to feel that low calf kick and black. You're going to feel the inside of your thigh. Shit. You gonna try to walk off the pain. You'll switch stances cause it starts to hurt whack. He didn't recognize he's switching stances. He attacks the other leg now both your legs are fucked up. Yeah, he comes down the middle with a need of the solar plexus. Now you're hurt. Try to play it off. It's just a matter of doing his game in his instyle vendors game. His game is keep the fight standing, fuck you up. And then Ben aspirins, it's grab a hold of you. Fuck you up. Drag it to the ground. Fuck you up. It's a matter of like who, who's better at the weak aspect of the other person's game, right? Yeah. Yeah. How can I take advantage? Yeah. It's so crazy.

Speaker 1:          05:14          And no one could be the best at everything. So some MMA math is a notoriously difficult thing to do. Like say, say if, uh, if Jamie beats me, but I beat you, but you beat Jamie. Yeah. Like that happens. But that's MMA. Math. It's crazy. Always say that with like, you know, styles make fights, but it doesn't work with Floyd. See Him boxing that styles make fights only goes so far. With MMA it's, it's because of the sports more comprehensive because there's more skills, there's more different things happening in football. Compare to basketball. Maybe it's like there's more, there's more tools that can be used in here that can offset what's going on it. Basketball, the warriors are going to beat any team four to seven games. It, that's just going to happen. I don't know shit about basketball or football, so I'm just guessing.

Speaker 1:          06:05          You can be a superstar. Like there's no one position in football date can change the game. There's no, I think at quarterback silver overrated. And to be honest with you, I think the most important positions, authentic defensive line, well, I'm always amazed at Tom Brady's body, how regular it is. Super, super regs, super regular, but they get it. That whole, that team gets it. They like, like I think Tom Brady's like 15th highest paid quarterback in the league. It's like, right. But if you look at elite athletes body, right? I want to see a dude is built like Kamar Uzman. Yes, the UFC welterweight champion. Yeah. That's an elite. You look at him, I go, oh, he's not in the lead athlete. Looks like a UFC champion. He's not an elite athlete. When you hit well, greatest quarterback of all time, whoa. Where is, see this guy without a shirt on your father.

Speaker 1:          06:56          You know what? It looks like a Tom Tom Brady. Tom Brady looks like. Oh yeah. I mean, what makes that guy so special as things like sometimes you know something's going on. Yeah. He's up here and I think, you know, he's got a lot of it up here and he works hard. It's like, you know, sometimes the greatest aren't that great picture of him next to Kamara Uzman you don't know what it is. It's like sometimes having all the natural tools is a to your detriment is looking at that. Yeah Bro. Come on sample. Yeah, like a leopard. Yeah, he's ready. Yeah. Ben aspirins similar to, yeah, he's got a little muffins. He's got a little muffin. Ben aspirins got even worse. Pull up a picture of Sam down in wait Ben Aspirin. Cause he doesn't want to and he's got it like that. I don't give a fuck.

Speaker 1:          07:47          He's, he feels like he's so much better as a wrestler that everybody else is fucked. Give, give me an image. Yeah, go to his abdomen looking at that. I mean, he's got abs underneath that, uh, that's from one FC. He looks even worse now. Yet winning. Yeah. There he goes. I mean that is not, that's Tom Brady, man, the ideal male combat body. You would think that's not what the ideal combat body looks like. But he'll fuck shit up. This is a picture of him with [inaudible] there, but he's got a shirt on. Yeah. Ooh, Swan is insane. Lucky for him.

Speaker 1:          08:30          But like this is just some guys that like, okay, Francis and Ghana is a perfect example. Some guys look like a destroyer. They just look like a destroyer in Ghana was like six [inaudible] five, 200, maybe more than 65, six guys. Like I think you were saying earlier about the, about the uh, Jujitsu, right? Like, and it's not just in, in this, as in anything. It's like sometimes the guys with all the natural ability, they don't have the, the work ethic to be the greatest because it comes so easy. You know, it's like, like we, we all know comics that are like so funny hanging out and they're okay on stage and it's, I think it's be, as comedy comes so easy to them, they don't hit the gym. You know what I mean? Like, maybe it's, you need that like Jordan, almost like sociopathic approach to it. You know, where like, like we were having this conversation earlier is like, Huh? Like do you think Jordan's happy? I don't think he's happy. I remember when he was inducted, abducted, abducted, inducted into the hall of fame. I think you've got to tell him he was an abducted in plain sight. And I was like, Bro, this guy, fuck he is the goat.

Speaker 1:          09:45          Do you remember when he was inducted into the hall of fame and he was talking about writers, he's talking shit about writers. Fuck yeah. He wasn't thanking his coaches and his teammates and it's been an amazing ride and I feel so blessed and fortunate. No, he's still like in fuck you remember when you said that? Fuck you. 1993 your sports illustrated issue. You said buy shoes look shitty. Well he has his furnace race. Some people have, some people need that as a furnace. Like they need that, that competitive drive, you know? And like, I feel like, I feel like that happens when you don't derive joy from what you do. You know, like you derive joy from that outcome. You're, you're obsessed with outcome. You know, like at least for me, everything before was outcome, right? It was like, I'm good if, if I get a special, I'm good if I'm doing these things or I'm good if I kill.

Speaker 1:          10:40          And the second I wa I was stripped of the opportunity to do those things. I actually found like I loved creating more and then whatever the outcome was was extra. Does that make sense? Right. I think it's a happier path. I think so too. But I don't know if it's the path to greatness as much as the path of the psychopath, especially when it comes to competitive sport. Hundred percent something about the best athletes. They all miserable. How they, they have a fucking self-loathing. They, and they also have an ego and they have this, this anger towards the competition. Like if you beat them, they would say that if you beat Jordan and it came pool fucking hate you for playing again. Yeah, but it needs it. He's, he operates on, I'm not good enough, and if I beat you, then he goes, all right. I was good enough.

Speaker 1:          11:32          I don't even know if it's that he thinks he's not good enough is that he knows he can get you don't quit, motherfucker. I'm going to get you. But why does he need to get you? I Dunno. He needs to because it's like he needs to confirm something maybe. Right. I need to confer. It's constant confirmation. I need to confirm, confirm, confirm where it's like, not that he doesn't believe he's great, that he wants to confirm it constantly. It's, it's his little shadow of a doubt. Yeah. I'm great. I'm great. He's walking around, I'm great, and there's a little voice in his head is going, hey, you might not be that great. How about when he played baseball? That motherfucker want to prove you're the hardest thing in sports hitting a baseball. It's the hardest fucking thing. And he just jumped from basketball to baseball and was people act like he was trash. He wasn't even that bad.

Speaker 3:          12:19          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:19          He hit like two 50

Speaker 1:          12:24          no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Baseball card I'm looking at says he was three Oh two at that. Maybe what it might be for that's for nine one 85 out of six 15 at bats, bro. Talking about the hardest thing in sports is hitting a fucking basement. The fact that he, I mean there's a bunch of rumors and why he even went into baseball first place, but like that it's that cycles in Campbelltown gambling. Some people say, you know, there's, there's a bunch of different things I don't want to put out there cause I don't know. But like it's one of those, I think there is a balance man. I think that you could, I think if you truly love what you do, like if you love the creative aspect and then you have high standards for yourself, then you can achieve both. Yeah. I think that achieving quote unquote greatness, um, and living with misery, I don't think that's worth it. No, I don't think that's where the, for you, it's like you got one shot at this man like this, this life man, like you got one shot at it, try to figure it the fuck out and it takes time to figure the fuck out. But it's one of those things you can't even really explain to people, but if you can, I'm approaching this point in my life where like, yeah, I think I, I get it.
