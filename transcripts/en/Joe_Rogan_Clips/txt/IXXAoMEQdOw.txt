Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. A amazing pace. Sodas. You look at guys, you know Jon Jones has good cardio. Very good cardio. Yeah. Might be EPL. We'll figure it out. I was on when you're talking about that, can't trust anything disappointing. Was that how disappointing that broke my heart. John John's dude, you broke my heart, dude. Jamie sent it to me. I was at a universal, my wife and my kids. I know Dallas, Texas with you because what was I doing? Uh, I forget. Oh, I think, oh, I was working for showtime and I have my phone and then I, I look at, I have 70 Miss Techs and 23 minutes called like, what the fuck out? It's someone that likes own, died. Oh No. Who Died? And I look and it's like John Jones, like someone might as well go, hi. Jamie sent it to me. I thought it was a show.

Speaker 1:          00:46          Me Too. I thought the people were messing with me. I looked at my phone, I was like, this is no one that you sent to me. I, you're the first one I take someone. Is this real? You went? Yes. Well my heart John Snow. Once you start talking, once he started talking back and forth with the golden snitch that gone snitch, there's zero jokes there. And listen, when the golden snitch comes out with something Dave brand that pisser through a ton of tests. It's not like a, it's not fake news. His was his shit. Apparently a court, well hold on. I don't think I can say this right cause I had an expert. I talked with an expert about this drug and he fucking dropped some knowledge on, okay, this is what I've heard. This may not, may or may not be true because this is the reason why I don't tell you to say this cause I'm, I'm not, I'm not 100% aware.

Speaker 1:          01:32          Maybe we can find some information online available. What I had heard is that this drug is not detectable in blood, that it's a drug that's detectable in urine and they have to in a new test, right. The test, is it a new task? What from what I heard too is the Usada is they have a new test. I'll see the on announcing, hey, we're doing this now. Everyone welcome to the party. And this drug was also, it's, it's very common around power lifters cause you can use in competition and by the time you get tested after it has, uh, hours, a half life. So shelf life is super short, but you take it and make you super aggro and strong. So they, and they go, it's so hard to obtain legally. Most everyone gets a black market. And when you get a black market, you don't know where it's coming from.

Speaker 1:          02:18          And a lot of time, and this happens with a lot of power lifters in their athletes, when they test hot for this, it's because they got a bad batch or something else mixed into it. Oh, this is gone from my super knowledgeable dude who knows about it. Oh, it makes you anger all huh? The confidence. Yeah. Oh, and he goes in it, it lasts maybe an hour, maybe two hours Max. And that's how your system, he goes, he goes, so that makes sense by some would fail directly after cause it, no, no, no, no, no, no. He, he, he failed after the weigh in.

Speaker 2:          02:49          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:49          That's when he failed.

Speaker 1:          02:53          This is after the weigh in? I don't think so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We'll either way. Yeah. Well maybe it's like lingering. Well that's what he's saying better what he's saying. He's saying well, but also I heard that they would use a new test to maybe someone gave him a tainted sandwich. Maybe some tainted take pills. Either way. You broke my heart. I'm off. I'm off the train. I'm off the God damn train and I'm sick of though. We have no idea what happened. It was just Dick Pills. I'm like, I'm out. I'm out. How dare you? Well, is he offering up any possible scenario for what happened? No. He tweeted out like, this is when I find out who my real friends are. Hashtag blessed boy, fuck that noise. That sounds like you're feeling sorry. She's just ain't helping me out of this one.

Speaker 1:          03:33          So much to be grateful for. Well have seed money, but yeah, that's a good amount. Yeah, he's got a nice family. It's true. Good friends. Hopefully whatever. Whatever the fuck is happening. But here's the thing, man, they have a second fire. Joe, listen to it multiple times. Sada, since the golden snitch has been around and he's a motherfucker. I liked the guy. But if you're a fighter, he's a motherfucker. Well, hey, he's doing exactly what he's supposed to do. [inaudible] circle doing the sport baseball first. Now you're hitting all the fighters are ruining it because they know what the fucking parameters are. Now let's have some fun. I agree. I agree. I don't look, look, here's the thing about this fight. Do you think Dana's ever like God, what kind of testing was done for this boy? Maybe where the Conor McGregor fight.

Speaker 2:          04:16          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:16          I those new lights. What do you, what do you, I like what you're doing the place, man. You know what man? I like the curtains, right? When I pulled the new studio, I'm going to do the curtains. Yeah, you should, man. Uh, yeah, but Novitsky is a guy that you don't want on your bad side. Oh No. But do you ever think days like, Damn Bro, relax me. Hired Joe. But Jesus, they knew what they were getting into. And you know what, they just decided, this is only one way to clean up the sport. Bring in the guy who was the very best to catching people for doing drugs. Ma'Am, ma'am, ma'am, did they do? And here's the thing, Jon Jones, since you saw us coming in, he's failed three out of four tests. The only one he did a full line was a co Osp. Coke is coke. Coke is coke pro. Once, Oh, so that's fine.

Speaker 2:          05:09          Okay.
