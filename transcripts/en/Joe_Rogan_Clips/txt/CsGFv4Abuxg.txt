Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. Anyway, thanks for coming you guys. Thanks for having us. It's a weird time. You know, I've been extra weirded out over the last couple of months and I just got back from Mexico. I was on vacation and I didn't do shit for a week. And in not doing anything for a week, I really got a chance to sit down and think about stuff. And I'm more weirded out by life today than I think I ever have been before. So I'm excited to have you on because I want to hear your story because Sam has been telling me about it and I looked into it and it's d please explain like what happened to you, like where you were and what happened to you.

Speaker 2:          00:36          Okay, so it was, uh, you're, you're talking about the panic attack was 2004. I was on a little show that we do at ABC news called Good Morning America shots, a big show out, a little shell. It's not a little show. And I was, I was doing the job that I was filling in as the newsreader. That's the person who comes on at the top of each hour and read the headlines. And, uh, I just freaked out. I just lost it. So it was a couple of seconds into it and I, I started to get really scared and it just, uh, if you've ever had, have you ever had a panic of no. So it's like anxiety on steroids, so you start to worry, but then your fight or flight instincts kick in. So, um, your lung seize up, your palms start sweating, your mouth dries up, your heart is racing, your mind is racing.

Speaker 2:          01:27          You just, I couldn't breathe and therefore couldn't speak. So a couple seconds into reading what was supposed to be six stories right off of the teleprompter, I just, I lost the capacity to speak and I had to kind of squeak out. Uh, something about, you know, back to you, back to the main anchors. Wow. That sucked. Uncontrollable. No. What, what caused it? Uh, no, I do. Yeah, definitely. No. Um, it's some dumb behavior in my personal life is what caused it. I had spent a lot of time as, as a war reporter at ABC News. Um, I was in Afghanistan and Pakistan, Israel, the West Bank, Gaza, six, six trips to Iraq. And, uh, I had come home from a long run and I, I covered, uh, Kinda the pre-invasion invasion and then, uh, insurgency in one's kind of six month run. And I came home after that and I, I got depressed and I didn't actually know I was depressed, but I was having some obvious symptoms in hindsight.

Speaker 2:          02:27          Uh, I was having trouble getting out of bed. I felt like I'd had a low grade fever all the time. And then I did something really smart, which is I started to self medicate with the cocaine and ecstasy. Uh, and even though I wasn't doing it all the time, I like to say it wasn't like that, you know, the, you ever seen the wolf of Wall Street where they're popping ludes that that wasn't me. I W and I wasn't getting high on the air or anything like that, but you know, I was getting, I was partying in my spare time because it made me feel better. Uh, so after I had the panic attack, I went to a doctor who's an in panic and he started asking me a bunch of questions, try to figure out what, what, what had caused the panic attack. And one of the questions was, do you do drugs?

Speaker 2:          03:06          And I was like, yeah, I do drugs. And he leaned back in his chair and gave me a look that's, uh, communicated, uh, the following sentiment. Um, okay, asshole, mystery solved. And he just pointed out that, you know, you raised the level of adrenaline in your brain artificially, uh, you, you make it much more likely to have a panic attack. And I at at, at baseline, I'm a jittery little dude, so it doesn't, it doesn't take much to put me in that zone. We just offered me coffee and I said, no, because even that will freak me out. Well, it's weird that ecstasy and cocaine was the combination because ecstasy is something that they actually give to a lot of soldiers that have PTSD. And there's been quite a few tests on that. Yeah. I don't, I don't actually think ecstasy was the problem. The coke, I think it was a coke when it makes sense.

Speaker 2:          03:52          Yeah. So those are the two drugs I was mostly doing. How often were you doing it? I would say, you know, there would be months where I wasn't doing it at all because I would, I was off, I covered the 2004 presidential campaign and I didn't have a lot of time to be snorting coke. So, um, but when I was home and around my friends, you know, on a good, on a busy week, you know, two, three times a week. Wow. That's a lot. Yeah, that'll do. Yeah. There's a, there's a comeback right now that, uh, cocaine is experiencing really ever go away. Did, I dunno, I've never done it. Was there some sort of cocaine recession that it had to bounce back from? Believe there was really, no, this is what I'm talking totally. Ignorantly. I'd been out of the game for a long time, so, yeah.

Speaker 2:          04:36          Yeah. I'm, I'm kind of boring now. Um, uh, but it feels to me like it's kind of a perennial favorite. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, I feel like it went through a recession. Maybe it's just my perception. I had a buddy of mine when I was in high school and his cousin was a hooked on coke and I watched while we're in high school, we start selling it and he withered away, lost like 30 pounds or something like that. And just him and his girlfriend just hide out in the attic. They lived, they had an attic apartment. They would just hide out there and watch TV and do coke and sell coke to people. And I was like, well, fuck that drug, whatever that drugs do. And like these people, it's like, it was almost like knowing someone who had gotten bitten by a vampire.

Speaker 2:          05:14          Right. It becomes something different. It was very strange. So my experience is seeing people do that led me to never do it. Yeah. I mean, it certainly was not like that for me, but you know, I, I could see it over the horizon. You can, it's an incredibly addictive drug. Um, so I think you've made the right call. Yeah. It seems a little, it's got a little too much gravity attached to it. Yeah. I mean, you, you, you can get hooked and it will bring you down. There are other drugs you can do. I'm not recommending drugs, but, uh, the way my friends, Sam, my half brother, Sam over there, uh, there are other drugs, drugs you can do that have vastly lower addictive, uh, a character, a character. What's the word I'm looking for here? So, characteristics. Yes. Thank you. Um, so how did you recover?

Speaker 2:          06:05          I, so I wasn't actually doing it that long. I actually never done hard drugs into my early thirties, and when I came home from the war zones and, um, and that's what started it. Yeah. Yeah. Just were freaked out by seeing too much. No, it's actually, it wasn't PTSD. Uh, it was, I was addicted to the adrenaline I was having. I was, it was not that I was traumatized, it was that I was enjoying it too much and I would come home in the world would seem gray and boring. Uh, yes. That was, that was the problem. Did you watch hurt locker? I'm sure he did it right. Yeah. Did that resonate with you? It's been awhile since I watched it, but apps, absolutely. I want to just be clear that the experience of a journalist is so different from the experience, so much more mild than the experience of, uh, an enlisted man or a woman.

Speaker 2:          06:52          So I don't want to compare my experience to the hurt locker. I'm a, I'm a observer on the side and I, and, and I don't even want to compare my experience to more experienced war correspondents out there. I'm thinking of like guys like Richard Angle on NBC. Absolutely. I just actually sat down with him the other day for, he's got a new documentary coming out. Um, my experiences are much more mild than that, but certainly enough to really get a sense of how thrilling it is. There's an expression, there's nothing more thrilling than the bullet that misses you. And in my case, luckily they all missed. That was not true for some of my friends. Um, but you, so I had a real sense of the stakes. But 80 is exciting. Uh, it's also thrilling on a, um, on a idealistic level. I mean, I believe in the importance of bearing witness to the what?

Speaker 2:          07:41          To the tip of the spear, to what we're doing, to what our military is doing in our name. So all of that is a heady mix. So you knew people over there, a journalist that got killed? Oh yeah, absolutely. A very good friend of mine, the guy who actually ultimately set me up with my wife is a guy named Bob Woodruff, who was the anchor of world news tonight on ABC News. He had only been in the chair for about a month when he was on a trip to Iraq and he got hit, literally got his head, and you're really blown off when he was in the back, when he was in the top of an Iraqi tank. Uh, almost died is an absolute miracle is alive. There are pictures of him on the Internet with basically half ahead. Um, traumatic brain injury was brought back to life. Is, is to this day walking miracle that he's alive.

Speaker 2:          08:27          Uh, and after he recovered, he then introduced me to the woman I married. Uh, so he's a close friend and I, uh, I saw cases like that and lost friends, both Iraqi friends and journalists, friends. Um, my, the woman I was dating at the time when I, when I was spending a lot of time in Iraq, she got hit by a tank shell. Um, she was in, in the, the hotel Palestine where all the were staying. She was on a balcony in, or one of her colleagues in the balcony below, or he got a direct hit and died. Uh, he, she carried him to the hospital and she basically got the reverberations and couldn't hear. Still can't hear as far as I know. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          09:10          Ooh. When you're a journalist and you're over in Iraq or in Afghanistan, you're in war, and what you're experiencing is so far removed from the day to day life that most people experience. What, what is it like trying to relay that to people? How difficult is it trying to cause so I think so many people have this almost, um, dramatic television movie slash view of, of war where they don't, they don't ever experience it. Like I would imagine probably 99% of the people that are in this country will never expect it.

Speaker 2:          09:48          No. And that's good. Um, no, it's, it's, it's, I don't know that you can, uh, uh, describe it, uh, in a way that will really give the full picture of it's, uh, absurdities and horrors and long stretches of boredom punctuated by terror. Um,

Speaker 3:          10:09          and also this other piece, which is taboo to talk about, which is the pleasure and excitement. Then people get fighting wars. I mean, they go, this is Sebastian younger thesis as well. I mean, there's just a camaraderie is the most intense comradery they ever experienced. And so that, that's something they come back to civilian life and are missing it. And, and it's part of what's so difficult about coming back

Speaker 2:          10:30          and that's why you see them a lot of, uh, risk taking behavior among, uh, vets, um, eat, because I know that you're looking for another way to get that hit of adrenaline for sure. There was a, uh, there's a book and I'm blanking on the name, is a great book written by a much more experienced war corresponded to me. He used the phrase war is a drug and that to me sums it up, at least in my experience, I got hooked on the experience of being in these really elevated situations, heightened situations, cinematic dramatic situations. And I would come home and I just, I didn't know what to do to replace it. And so this synthetic squirt of adrenaline that you can get from cocaine seem to do it for me, obviously had tremendously negative consequences. And so I wouldn't recommend it, but I see why people do this.

Speaker 1:          11:26          So how did you, how did you bounce back?

Speaker 2:          11:30          Oh, that was actually the question you asked me before that I somehow neglected to answer. So the doctor who pointed out that I was

Speaker 1:          11:38          okay,

Speaker 2:          11:38          an idiot and doing drugs and it caused the panic attack, uh, I agreed he didn't think I needed to go to rehab because it was the, it was pretty short lived. It was, I was in my early thirties when I started, and it's still in my early thirties when I had a panic attack. And so it was only a couple of, he said, just, I want you to come see me once or twice a week, forever, a forever. He said basically indefinitely. Um, so I still see him, but not, not, yeah, it's a good business model, but not that, I mean, it's been, well north of, uh, it's been about 13 years, so I don't see him that often now, but for a long time I saw him intensively. Uh, so that, uh, you know, it wasn't easy. It's not easy. Um, and I wouldn't have, I wouldn't call what, I mean, there are people who have had drug addictions that are vastly more severe than mine. Right. Um, but it's, uh, it sucks to stop a habit that is giving you pleasure on, you know, pretty in pretty, um, prominent areas of your brain.

Speaker 4:          12:46          Yeah.
