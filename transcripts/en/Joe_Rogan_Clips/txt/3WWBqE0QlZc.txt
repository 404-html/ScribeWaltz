Speaker 1:          00:00          No drugs, no drugs, no alcohol. No. He drank a little wine though, right? No Fat Pussy. I'm telling you that shit will kill Ya. No fat. No a little allergic. I'm a big fan for those who want, but no, I have to drink a little wine though. I do drink a little wine, but I don't think that qualifies as a drink. A glass of wine with the meal. My sons and my daughters, my brothers, sisters, they Thanksgiving dinner, beer beers, better than coke. Right? Vastly. It's when you start to enter the drools zone and I have a big problem of course. And all of a sudden if there's a problem, I can't rely on you anymore. I want to be reliable and that's why I have a problem with comfortably numb. I think in my experience, you can't wake up the bass player cause he's comfortably numb.

Speaker 1:          00:51          The guys don't show up. He can't tune his guitar. He forgot the lyrics were not as tight as we could be. You're fired. I know what you're saying, but this is what I'm saying to you, is it? This is just a discipline issue and it's not the marijuana or anything that gets people like that. It's a lack of discipline. I you in the digital world and the Jujitsu world is filled with people that smoked pot and these mother fuckers work hard, but they want, what's the number one karate guy who was the guy that died? Bruce Lee. Bruce Lee did. He spoke dope. Aww. He ain't hash eight hash. Yeah. You know, he's into eating hash. Here's my question, but that's not what killed him. Here's, here's my question to you. As I offered to my son Rocco [inaudible] because he's an advocate of marijuana. Yes. Okay. And I sat Rocco and I said, and I said, so do you really believe that perfectly clean and sober [inaudible] taking care of your health with a conscientious diet, good athletic workout, discipline, physical prowess.

Speaker 1:          01:57          Do you really think that an outside source, payoti mushrooms, dope, whatever you want to call it, do you really think that with that outside influence you can do something you can't do unto your God given gift, individual self. I'm convinced Joe, that you will be the absolute best you can be. You will accomplish what I think is a self inflicted curse of modern man. That 90%, 98% of humanity might be tapping into 5% of their capabilities because they get an a treadmill. They get an uh, a paradigm, self restricted pier nine ever. So decreasing a view of the world and experiences and the overwrote the destroyed road over traveled versus not only the road less traveled but the non road untraveled that's my favorite. I'm convinced that you Joe Rogan. Hmm. We'll find your superior definitive best without any outside influence. I believe you have the par.

Speaker 1:          03:10          I think I have the power when I get onstage tonight and you gotta come, you gotta come witness this but my bed and I do like it out. We'll figure out a time. I can't come tonight. Secondly, I got an orgy show at the Improv of human fire. We put our fists together and Chant James Brown and Wilson picket and funk brothers and it's like the last wolves on an island give gnashing of teeth over the last bone in Shard of flesh. It's, it's a, it's an out of body soaring above life itself experience that we have in us. I don't need anything. I understand me, I understand that. But you don't use anything, so you're, you're talking from a place of non experience when it comes to marijuana or mushrooms or any of these things. But my 70 years, I say at least 55 of those years from the beatniks to the hippies to the, to the friends and you got to meet this Wayne Kramer Guide Mc five guitars, new book, the hard stuff.

Speaker 1:          04:13          He and I were born the same time, same influence, Detroit, the swamps, the outdoors. But Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Motown, James Brown, he started smoking dope. I didn't. And he's, uh, in any got a heroin and the credit and any prison. Again, stealing and then arrested and I'm having the time of my life and he's like wallowing and assess pool in dog shit. And I'm not knocking Wayne. I'm saying that he was courageous to write this book. It's a brilliant book. You got to have them on. You're going to read it. You're going to, you're going to be consumed by his conversational writing of the MC fives, a ascension to the most authoritative power house music I've ever witnessed in my life, to a bunch of dirt bags on the downward spiral because of drugs and alcohol. I know that happens. It definitely happens. But it happens with everything.

Speaker 1:          05:08          It happens with people when they eat too much food. It happens with people with gambling. It happens as the merchant, different things. But I think it's because of discipline. It's because they don't have a clear path. I think it's cause they let themselves become self indulgent and they let themselves be weak. But I'm saying is that I know a lot of people who use, whether it's psychedelics or they use marijuana and they use it to enhance their perspective, it doesn't become the primary focus of their life. It doesn't consume their life. They don't allow it to consume their life. There's a whole other world of disciplined marijuana enthusiasts and they're confused the same way people confuse hunter's same way people think of hunters as being lazy, drunk and so cruel to animals. And you and I know that that's not the case at all. Some of the most disciplined, focused and best people know are intense people because to the be at Cameron Hanes, to be a John Dudley, you have to be a superior type of human being should breath leach.

Speaker 1:          06:04          Yeah. You have to be able to execute in that extreme moment, that moment where that animal walks out to that shooting window and you're looking at this three 90 bull elk and help screaming, screaming, and overwhelming all over itself, overwhelming and it's 40 yards away and your center in that pen, it takes the magic powerful human being to execute that shot. And I don't think most people are aware of that. Most people don't know in the same way that that's misunderstood. I think marijuana is misunderstood because there's a lot of dummies in this world. If you get a group of 100 people, what are the odds that one of them's going to be a dummy? Fucking 100% right and more nowadays more than one. Yeah. Well, if you get a group of a hundred people that use marijuana, the one loud fucking stupid one defies or defines rather what marijuana users are.

Speaker 1:          06:53          You see that fucking idiot who's pissing all over himself and fallen down so high he can't walk. That's what you think of. You don't think of the Brazilian Jujitsu black belt at smokes pot and then goes out and strangles 50 people in in class. You don't think of people to take yoga class. I liked hiring marijuana. Strangling. There should be a nice whole, Eh, listen, I am absorbing, absorbing, in, respecting and considering your word. It can get away from you. Yeah, you can get away from me. All I've ever said, everything can get away from you. That's all I've ever seen. But I think it's because these people that consume it, they don't have those other qualities. They don't have discipline and focus. They don't have respect for their body. See the thing with that, especially in the Jiu Jitsu community, it's super common. Marijuana is really, really, really, really common.

Speaker 1:          07:41          Yeah. I mean they, there's a show called high rollers where these guys, they put together a Jujitsu tournament and everybody had to get high before they rolled. And you're talking like elite world class Brazilian Jiu black belt competing high on marijuana and that's gotta be one of the highest forms of disciplines very available to us. It's a very, very right there with the camera names. Mountain climbing bowl, calling an oak in your lap. Yes. Well you're, you're, you're doing an art that's designed to break bodies and the two of you are going to do it together. And the whole idea is that you're going to get someone into a position where they have to tap or they're going to get their arm snapped or they're going to get choked unconscious. It's intense, extremely difficult pursuit. And a lot of people do it under the influence of marijuana.

Speaker 1:          08:21          Do you know any of these? Master Jujitsu Martial Artis? Oh yeah. That that don't do any, oh yeah. Oh yeah, and how do they perform? They perform well. Do very well. There's, let's look. There's the elite world class athletes in Jujitsu that don't generally I won the world champion got high or not well. I know a lot of them I do, but I know a lot of them do. A lot of world champions do. I know a lot of like real multiple time world champ didn't. They're marijuana users. Yeah. How about world champions that don't get high? There's a lot of those to see. What happens with marijuana is, is increased sensitivity that a lot of people talk about and they talk, they call it paranoia because there's a lot of things that people put blinders on their life. A lot of people aren't aware and I'm sure because of your hunting, you're spending time in the woods, you're soaking in all the variables, the sound.

Speaker 1:          09:10          When I'm a radar, you're there, right? You're aware. There's a lot of people that go through life like this, no pick go through life like they're looking through a toilet paper roll over in the left lane right now they're not. They're not using their blinkers. And those people, those people, when they smoke marijuana, they freak out. They get paranoid because what's happening is the marijuana increases your sensitivity. He makes you aware of all these variables and a lot of people consider that paranoia. You start freaking out about all these variables. He started thinking about your mortality and instead of embracing this time as a magical moments that of being in this moment, you just start getting overwhelmed and you feel your own heartbeat and you start freaking out of this all the time. Yeah. It's without anything. It's an entheogenic. It brings you closer to whatever you are not encumbered by your ego.

Speaker 1:          09:58          I will admit in escapable that everything affects everyone differently. Yes. But once you make it widespread, I mean I've studied the results of legalization for recreational use in Colorado and how the highway fatalities and accidents have increased, but you know what else is increased the population in proportion. So it causes breeding. Taz is more people there, more people are there, so you having more accidents there. The problem is, is a boom of population also boom in the economy, a boom in the real estate, real estate's taken off. Yeah. There's a lot of losers there too. There's a lot of hacky sack playing, dirty, stinky hippies that are wandering around with no shoes on. You're going to get those. You're going to get those. You know, if you have an opening welcome society that's, that doesn't lock those people up, you're going to have those. It's a part of freedom.

Speaker 1:          10:48          Yeah, it sucks. Look, losers are a part of this safe world that our kids are allowed to wander through. We want the world to be safe, so sometimes things are too safe. You nerf the edges and you get a bunch of people that are used to hitting their heads on things and they're not worried about it. You're going to have these losers, but it doesn't mean that everybody who does, it's a loser. I know a lot of CEO's of big corporations that have extreme rights responsibilities and they like to smoke a little pot. I get, I get punched back off and on Facebook, I'm a successful guy, run my family, I'm a good dad, I'm a good hunter and I'm a, I'm a Trump supporter and I get high like, Oh God bless you. It just, I don't want you, you know, babysitting my kids while you're high.

Speaker 1:          11:27          Yeah. But it's discipline. Discipline is the thing that fucks people up and the lack of this lack of the lack of discipline. And I think that's what everything, it could be with sex, it could be with gambling, it could be with extreme risky behaviors. People could just get, get real nutty and get carried away with things. And sometimes those things are just a big distraction for the lack of discipline they have in pursuing their own goals in life. I think that that is the real high in life. The real high in life is pursuing difficult things. Ratification. Yes. Getting good at them and then accomplishing your goals. There's a, there's a high to that that's, you can't find that in pills. It doesn't exist in a needle. That high is a high of discipline and determination and focus and learning, but there's so much weakness out there, especially in a society has been spoiled for so long and you get a trophy if you don't even show up and you can't hurt people's feelings and bullied, get bullied and you're crying, stood up, fight and back.

Speaker 1:          12:24          I mean, there's so many manifestation of a cultural deprivation that runs a muck in our society that my fear is, and I've studied all these mass shootings. Joe, the Virginia Tech shooter. Hi, well, they're all buying. Hi. Yeah, but they're all on SSR. I's, they're all on pills and pharmaceuticals. Almost all of them are a presence on the PROZAC and their parents. All of them are chemical covering up a kid that shows enthusiasm. It's called attention disorder now. I mean, if they had that back when I was growing up, I had end up playing, I don't know it. I ended up being Ozzie, and the problem is the word drugs, like you and I are drinking coffee. We're on drugs right now. We're on caffeine. This is a drug. There's some drugs that if used responsibly or, okay. A glass of wine with dinner is a drug. Understood. It's a mild drug. A little tiny toke. Yeah. For sex with the misses. That's a little drug. It makes you most see. I've never smoked because I can't smoke. I get in when I shoot my machine guns, all I do is chew on a Cuban. I don't really smoke it.
