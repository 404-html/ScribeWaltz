Speaker 2:          01:21          This whole thing has been completely fucking insane. And you, yeah, and I don't have to tell you, but you caught this madness is outrage culture right at the peak. I think you, you hit peak outreach culture. Thank you. Well, people didn't give a fuck if you were making a joke, get, didn't give a fuck. Have you had no idea that that lady was black? Didn't give a fuck what your mental state was. Didn't give a fuck if you were on Ambien, didn't give a fuck if you were drinking. Didn't give a fuck if you sincerely apologized. Oh, go ahead. I do want to talk. Don't pick that. Did, but they didn't care that you, you sincerely apologized and did not, didn't mean to offend. You were cracking a joke about it. Woman

Speaker 1:          02:08          it, it was funny how they've missed, characterize it and lied about it and added words to it. But, um, yeah, I like talk about the tweet, but uh, yeah, I seriously apologize to all who might inadvertently offended and because they were offended for like it, it wasn't even what they say they were offended cause it didn't say that, but they think that I tweeted a said she looked like, uh, you know, somebody and I never said anything about her looks, it was a political tweet and it's just proof of how um, everybody's under mass mind control because they took a, um, and of course I'm always interested in that. You know, you know that I've talked to, yeah, that's what I think people are under the wave of self imposed mind control. I don't think it's like there's anybody pulling the strings you can get out of it.

Speaker 1:          03:05          No, I don't think anyone's pulling the strings. I don't think this is a dead, no, I don't, I don't think it's by design. I think people were caught up in a wave of fear and paranoia and political correctness. And I think one of the reasons why attack they attack someone like you is first of all, you're wealthy and successful and famous. You are beautiful and one of the best comics of all time. And you're also, uh, you're, you're an easy target. You're a white woman. As a white woman, what do you identify as? I identify as a Jew. Well, there you go. And this is what you thought this woman was as well. What is my cousin Sharon? She looks just like my cousin, but it wasn't nothing to do with how she looks that came after my tweet, but the next blessing it about the planet of the apes of her hands. What she engineered in Iran. And I had been on there talking about the, the, I call it a woman's revolution in Iran for years and speaking to people in Iran and bout it and what it means to, uh, the women who are second class citizens there. And uh,

Speaker 1:          04:22          so if you take that one tweet out of like probably I tweet a lot. Yeah, I was, I was traveling 400,000. No, I don't go crazy. I stay crazy. I admit it. I mean, what the fuck? They're like, you know what you've said you're crazy for years and you know what? You're crazy. Well, yeah, I said it for fucking years. Well, it's also one of the reasons was our crazy, all comics are fucking nutso. At least I don't wash my keys like some, I know some guys they had, they got to wash their keys five, six, seven times where they can go on stage. What's his name? Oh, I'm so bad on names. Chris Farley. I always ask comics, you know, I ask him what's, what's your secret number? Which years Joe number. You don't have a number. You don't have to do something a number of times. You don't have a number. What's your birthday? Eight 1167 eight what's that? August eight 1167. You were born in 1967. Yes. Jesus. F Christ. Um, I was in the, my, I was in the Utah State Hospital. When you were born, what were you doing given birth? No, I was in a mental institution. That was my first hospitalization. It lasted for nine months and it was the Utah State Hospital in Provo where the Osmonds are from. So it was always a big Marie Osmond Fan. The, the mental

Speaker 2:          05:58          health aspect of this conversation is an important one because here's my take on this. Extremely important. It is important. And yesterday was mental health awareness day. Yes, I know. And I was quite aware of being mentally help. The yesterday as I was smoking, if someone has, all I eat is cheese. If someone has a, an injured leg, you don't expect them to run marathons. If someone has a, you know, something wrong with their liver, you don't expect an a processed food correctly. You don't blame it on them. But if someone has a mental health issue and they do something erratic, yeah. Or they say something that's inappropriate and then they apologize for it. Or if they're a comedian or if they're comedian and you, you've had the jit imit Breal diagnosed, treated mental health issues, trauma related issues. There you go. How'd do you like that? It's a little, I can do that. Help you do better Kenya. Yeah. But for whatever reason, people want to pretend that this is a deliberate act by a calculating person who is just being an asshole. And that's not the case. You're not an asshole. Not at this time. I have been an asshole when you weren't here, but you weren't, that's not what you were doing. No, I was talking about

Speaker 1:          07:18          about Iran and the woman's revolution there and how, uh, how, and it's always been because you know what? I had my DNA done cause I wanted to know and I am of North African ancestry. How much, um, it's like a very small percentage, but it was something like 25,000 years ago, they left, um, north Africa, which is kind of Syria. And um, they went to Lithuania and um, Russia and uh, some Europe, July 23 and me or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. And it just answered so many questions for, you know, why I feel this yearning towards that part of the world. But I do, you know, and especially the geopolitics, there are some, it always intrigued me and I have always attempted to use my voice to um, you know, support all, all the people there. Well it's a fascinating, so it was, you know, this one tweet was about, it was about,

Speaker 2:          08:28          I mean it's actually a genius tweet if you really fucking know. What did you say? What exactly did you say to let's find the tweet, Jamie,

Speaker 1:          08:37          I'll tell you if it's, the artificially rendered is an artificially rendered one. Yeah, there's a lot of them. Were people distorted what you actually yeah, at first it was racist Roseanne and then about a couple weeks later it was disgraced comic Roseanne and her racist tweet. And then after that it was disgraced comic and her offensive racist tweet. Cause there's all these hoops you gotta jump through, you know, they're never done punishing. You were saying before that all my friends said don't apologize to social justice warriors because that's the kiss of death. That's fucking chum in the water. Blood in the water, you know, is definitely a little bit of that. But what I was saying before the podcast to you is I don't, I don't really, what I really think happens is they find a target and they don't care if it's a viable target, but once the target gets greenlit, they go after you until some new target comes along.

Speaker 1:          09:33          Until someone distraction the target and its recreational outrage, they find me, they attack you and they go after you and try to distort your position, the fuck you said. And obviously they don't. That's what kind of cracks me up. It's like, look at this, look what they're saying it meant and you know I'm not going to bow down before them and say you were right and they want me to, but they weren't right. I'm right. I wrote it bitch, so I know what I meant. So you don't get to tell me what I meant, but they don't care. It's just, the thing is they don't want to look at it rationally and say, well here's a woman that has a history of mental health problems. She was on Ambien and drinking. And she says something that is slightly irrational, but given your explanation of it, Doug both always think all my tweets make no sense.

Speaker 1:          10:24          You've been saying that for a fucking year since I went on Twitter. You're like, her tweets are just buttons, straight up crazy, crazy tweets for sure. I don't think they're crazy. You just don't get them. Well maybe if I was in the same mindset as you, I would get them. Yeah. But obviously no one had, when I say crazy, I don't think like other people. I know that I've always known that my whole life I had always test other people to see what they were thinking. Like as even as a kid, I'd be like in bed, I tried to fit in, they go, let's play barbies. You know? And I'm like, fucking, I don't want to, I'm like, okay, well, but let's have Barbie be a resistance fighter that paratroops into, um, you know, into the hidden lines of the German thing and save all the Jews. And they'd go, you have to be her cousins skipper. And then they'd hand me the skipper doll. I always had to personify skipper and they got to be Barbie. I didn't even know a bar. We had a cousin. Yes, skipper. She has a little tiny tits and I resented that because I always had very large pendulous breasts since I was four or five.

Speaker 1:          11:38          I did. I don't, I don't think or look like other people. I am an alien. Really? What planet you think you'd be from? Well, somebody told mass from [inaudible]. Do you know anything about that? That's the people that call the art bell show. They would always say that. Yeah. That's what they say. Round faces are fun. Play. Do you see you got around face. That's what I told you. I don't even go by what people look like except for I do look at the shape of their head. I have to admit that's how I classify people. I classified people my own way cause I don't think like everybody else thinks I take a person shape of their head and that's the group they represent to me. And I have noticed that the Dutch have the largest heads. The Dutch have pure score. Not all of them of course, but some of them you're the average height for a Dutch person, like six feet tall.

Speaker 1:          12:29          I know the women folks. Yeah. Vikings, Vikings, yeah. I love all the different peoples of the earth because they all have a variety of foods that I enjoy. So I like to, you know, I don't just mix with one kind of person. In my real life I mixed with all kinds of people and you know, cause I'll go anywhere for a free meal. But I, but I love, I love cultures and I love all people. That's all I want to say. You know, I would never, I'm not that person. You're not a racist by any stretch of the imagination, but you are a person. My sense that I'm a Misanthrope, I'm a misanthrope misanthrope but I am a respect truss of no man or woman. But most comedians, yeah, we're all like that, right? Thropic intentions or you have to hate all people the same, but you definitely have to mock and make them.

Speaker 1:          13:25          It's a part of the job description. Yeah, you're done the mock and make fun of and you, you look for things that are irritating about everything. No Shit right there. That's sort of the job. None of that. That was part of your character on your show. Yeah. It was part of the reason why ABC wanted you bag. It's part of the reason why the show became such a giant hit and its return. I mean it was a fucking huge hit coming right out of the gate. Yep. 28 million people. That's a lot of fucking panties is number one. Every episode. Yeah. That's a lot of people and a lot of that was because people love this aspect of you, but as soon as you get labeled a racist, everybody throws their hands up and goes, Whoa, I didn't know she was racist. She's racist. And they don't care about nuance.

Speaker 1:          14:07          They don't care about the details. They don't care about ambien. They don't care about alcohol. When I called you on the phone was the first thing that I, one thing I've learned Gel. Well, if you're going to take an ambien down, not do not drink a beer. Always only drink a wine with ambien. I have a good friend of mine who is one of the nicest, most respectful guys you ever want to meet. He woke up in Germany on a plane, covered in his own vomit with the police, standing over him, asking him if he knew what happened. He wound up getting arrested. They brought him to the jail in Germany and they add in the, he's a CEO of a large company and they went over things with him and they said, what happened? What

Speaker 2:          14:52          do you remember? He goes, well, I remember taking an Ambien and then that I went to sleep and then I had, I guess I had a beer at some point in time and they go, okay, stop. This is what happened. And so they described how he was hitting on the stewardesses and trying to start fights with men. That cabin and wasn't as being as real selfie was on Ambien. Yeah, I know. It starts thing. He's the nicest guy. If you knew this guy, you would never in a million years believe that he was capable of anything remotely like this. And the German people actually let him stay in the country. They let them continue his vacation. They're like, okay. For gave him promise not to do that again. He goes, I'm never fucking taking that shit again in my life. Yeah. And one of the things that I said to you when I called you up, I said, what were you doing well and you told me you are on Ambien. And I said, okay, we'll stop right there because I know quite a bit about that because I've had personal experiences with friends that have had real issues with ambien. I had a bid I did in my act about a friend of mine who literally made a meal while he was on Mbn. Yeah. Cooked at the supermarket. What? God food. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          15:55          Cool. Look at tiger woods that he was on that and then you'd go driving off in the golf cart and to meet some check, you know? And that I don't understand where people said they have sex on Ambien. People say that's a big thing that people take ambien to have sex. I don't even know how they can stay on. I guess they don't stay awake, but another part of them wakes up and their sex part comes out. That's all I can figure. I've never taken it. I'm terrified of this. Don't ever take it. Yeah, I get, nope. I have no problem going to sleep. I've never had a plan to do, but you know what I found is THC, they sell it down at the dispensary and there's one for sleep at night. And um, I've been doing that and I, I've been sleeping through the night, uh, when I was taking the sleeping thing to sleep and drug ambien, while I don't want to say it because we don't want to get sweet candy, man. You don't want to say it three times. You don't get sued. Not me. I say an Ambien. I bet you they give a fuck. They said, yeah. Did, do you see that? Yeah. Well, you know, I had Hamilton Morris on the podcast who was a drug expert. Yeah. And he w he writes for vice and it does a pieces for vice and he went and did a piece for vice

Speaker 2:          17:10          incident. He came on and went in great detail about how that, that is something that happens to people that, well, they have no idea what the fuck they're saying. It's called the hypnotic. That is the classification of drugs that it falls under. And people do all sorts of involuntary things when they're on there. No, it doesn't just make you say racist things, but you didn't say anything intentionally racist. No. It's the way people decide. Well,

Speaker 1:          17:35          about the work of Valerie Jarrett's hands. And I also was referencing my very favorite movie. So if we could talk about how fucking awesome that movie planet of the Apes, great fucking movie. Also. It's the definitive people, uh, get your, come on people now smile on your bird. It's like, come on. It's like the hundredth monkey. Is that the thing? Is that the name of it? That's what it is. The hundredth monkey on the typewriter. They write a curls. Mckees what is it? How that work, that if you have a certain amount of months, that hundredth monkey, that changes everything. If p f a f a species does something 99 times in a row, the hundredth time it's gone into their DNA. Yeah. And then they evolve to the next level. Hundredth monkey effect. I'm just effect is a hypothetical phenomenon in which new behavior ideas claimed to spread rapidly by unexplained means from one group to all related groups.

Speaker 1:          18:34          Once a critical number of members of one group exhibit a new behavior or acknowledged the new idea. Yeah. Well the thing is a lot of people put pictures of that woman right next to the lady. I understand the picture was put up after my tweet. I understand, but I am nothing to do with that picture. I didn't say she looked like anything I wrote. Seriously. I'm not that fucking shallow. Okay. I never talked about nobody's lugs unless they're like thin and blonde and I'm jealous but you know and youthful now but or whatever. But wasn't there another tweet that you made a long time ago about who was that other woman? Susan Rice. Yes. Yeah. Well you said she has giant swinging eight balls that she's a man. Let me explain that now. Cause this is the regional listic regionalism. I'm from Utah and all the girls in Utah, when we got married and are, we heard our moms do it too. It's always, where's your ape? They go, what's your age doing this Sunday? And he's like, oh, he's watching football. All good. Let's go out to lunch. You know, it's all, all of the men were all apes. That's how it is in a breeder culture. Like Salt Lake City, breeder culture. Yeah. Culture. So it's like, where's your ape? And there's like, man, you're a peasant. Big fucking swing and eight balls. I give him that. You know, it's a regional lipstick thing and uh, you know, so I used it and apologize, but yeah.
