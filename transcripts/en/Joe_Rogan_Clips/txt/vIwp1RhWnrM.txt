Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience go shows. You got more notes. How do I smelled it? I just wanted to finish that thing about MMA. Um, I want to ask you about little tag. Yeah. Who Was it? I did that for Jamie little, a nine year old shit talker who flashes money and it talks about her, uh, Bentleys and rolls Royces for nine years old and years old. It's fake. She's her parents talk her into it. So, so, but anyway, MMA for me is a music modern modernization act. Okay. So about five, about five, six years ago, Dean will uphold, and I just started looking at that and she's beautiful blonde lawyer, woman, great woman, very smart, very intelligent. Speaks over here at Brandeis or somewhere. She's my lawyer, was my manager for the longest time, but she and I decided to go to Washington has started flashing this shit around saying, you know, what's fair and what's not?

Speaker 1:          00:53          Why or musician is not getting paid. Right. So I just thought MMA, it's the same thing. Music modernization. So I won't forget this. I sometimes forget it cause my, you know, I forget. So to attain fair market value, royalty rates and treatment for music creators in the digital era. The GJ, the digital era right now is where if I, they can play my music because it's digital over air. You know, Spotify and Adam could pay the artists. Fuck me, I got enough money. I'm the happiest guy who came along. I got kids. I go to sleep fucking with a smile on my face. I get to do Joe fucking Rogan. Well, I'm happy you just recognize a band name, full name Aerosmith with Joe Perry. I'm happy as can be right, but I look at these poor fucks victim. You got to hear this well today too.

Speaker 1:          01:44          They get, they have to give up merchandise. They have to give up a piece of their concert sales. Oh, they have to give up everything. Well, yeah, that's what's going on because there's no more money in actual records sale. It's called a 24 seven or some kind of bullshit was that crazy thing where they have a piece of everything because managers see it and they want your money. Well, they also realize that their avenue of revenue was gone. So then they locked onto merchandise. They locked on to ticket sales, which used to be all yours, right? Yep. Like when you used to do concerts back in the day, you used to get paid for your record. And even if you got fucked over, you got some money from the record, but then you would get all the money for the concerts. Right? But, but well, not unless we were own managers.

Speaker 1:          02:20          90 10 means we take 90% out. 10% of the gift goes through there. So you make $800,000 a night company gets it. Oh God, that's different. Right? Isn't that a different thing? Well, the record company gets, gets publishing, you know who with all these digital outlets, of course. And then the, then the record company company decides to give whatever's left to the artist, which is usually little to nothing. Smoky fucking Robinson. My dear friend, I go up to this guy and I go, ah, don't you, but I love you seemed if that guy, all these songs, phenomenal. Oh, this fucking guy went to the digitals said you only $250,000 with roof they offered. They offered for this for his music being played. Why the last five years? Why do they owe him that? Because he, because he was getting nothing back. Nothing was coming to him.

Speaker 1:          03:17          He's gone. She, the coffers are empty. You know what I'm saying is what the fuck? I'm smokey Robinson, right. I hear my music, his music is covered by hunt. Thousands of people. The guy knew legally $250,000 was owed to him. Okay, okay. He was offered 12,000 and he was said, if you don't like it, sewers now smokey, you don't have that kind of money. So what we've done, the smokey Robinson doesn't have that kind of money. So, so what, what? Smokey Robinson should be just wealthy. Look at King. And this is not to say he's not. If he had no money at all, he's one of the happiest guy and his wife is his sweetest and maybe he's a town attain something that you and I know recognize yet or, or the mass media. But he's got something, he's rich. But when it comes to him getting paid, actually for songs, that's really fucked up.

Speaker 1:          04:12          So we decided to do a, I don't know, I don't know where it's going. I've got to talk to him. But David is real light. The president and CEO of the National Music Publishers Association and Dina, we went to, went to Washington magic, this beautiful blonde in this fucking guy. Now we're in Washington in me, you know, saying, what's up with this? This money is going right out the window and knocked to the artist. These new artists getting nothing. So we decided to do something for the first time songwriters will have representatives overseeing administration of mechanical licenses and administration. So someone's now, at least not only can he complain that there's someone watching the goes, no, no, no, no. You do. In fact legally owned 250,000 smoke. You can mirror sound and for the first time. So this is something we're trying to get passed in the next. Don't you think it should be that?

Speaker 1:          05:08          No, I do think, you know, that's the reason why we're not on that. We're not on Spotify and the reason why we're not honest, because it didn't make any sense. They were like, we want to put you on W it's going to be great for you. I'm like, how's it? Great. Yeah, you guys are going to make money like you guys are making money. You don't give us any. It's that whole streaming thing is this weird smoking mirrors song and dance they put on, you're going to be a part of something big. You're like, yeah, but what are you selling? All you sell is artists' work. You don't have anything to sell. Yup. And I seen him. The artists get paid so little, so little. So where's the money going? Because there's all these ain't never fucking pockets. Public companies and they're traded and they're worth millions and billions.

Speaker 1:          05:44          Like where's all that money? Where's it going? What's generating it? Can you need to say to them, what if I'm bigger than you aren't motherfucker, motherfucker. Well, 19 Oh nice. The laws were written. Check this out. Do you know nine on track? I'm like not paid attention to until fucking yesterday. Yesterday. I mean, you know, five, five weeks ago, so we're trying to get this shit go gains momentum and the Senate, oh, old smokey Robinson. Powerful yesterday. Yesterday. Jesus Christ. Jamie, you're on the ball. Wow. So this is it right here. I mean, you know. Well, yeah, there's been some fuckery. There's been some legal fuckery and he, you know, he created magic. This guy. I said, I said to him, what do you mean? I like you, but I love you. Seems that I'm always thinking of you. I said, where the fuck did you come up with a line?

Speaker 1:          06:36          Like I've said to Paul, you know, what was, what was this? You know, he says, well, I was sent to New York to do some kind of publishing thing with lawyers and I was sitting in a hotel in New York right before I went in and I thought, I wrote those lyrics. Somehow. Him being a young black men with songs 50 years ago in New York with lawyers, probably white, not just saying he was put in a situation where he had the magic, he had the magic. He wrote a paper, I don't like you. I love you. It seems like maybe the hate that he had for what was about to happen created the opposite. I don't know, but that's what he told me. He said, I was down there and waiting to meet my lawyers and I'm, I said that, let me ask you is you never know when, when Napster came along, I fucking hated that prick.

Speaker 1:          07:28          Yeah. You see they started stealing our songs. Yeah. Great. Take all the albums we've ever done. Take all the albums. Nuno court and nick, all the albums that fucking, you know, the rolling stones ever did put them in a box over there. Now all my friends can have access to that box. Anybody can do it. It's peer to peer. Everyone's sharing songs and I'm sure people who are listening to me now and say, what a prick. He's fucking ritual. Fuck. But what's happened is it's become the norm. Well, it's, let's be scared of norm is that people recognize that you can't do that with movies. Right. They recognize that if you're stealing movies, it's illegal. Like if you get caught with a bit torn account, you've got a bunch of movies on there and you're letting people download them, you can get prosecuted. Yeah. Let me ask you why so much for that and not for somebody songs?

Speaker 1:          08:13          Well, there is a thing with songs too, but it's just not as common. Right, Jamie, is that the case? Would people have been sued for having tons of songs? Right, for sure. The movie industry has gone after that. You go after you if you're doubling their movie. It's just songs for whatever reason, after Napster became something that people think that you should just be able to get for free and then passing me on the sick and Spotify and what's the other one? Spotify and what's the other? There's another one. Titles getting in trouble right now, whose title? The company that Jay z and with a few other, they're getting charged for streaming to funding streams and not paying people and all that. I mean, it's just think about some new bay. My daughter Chelsea, she's in a band with John Foster, her husband. They put something out and it's fucking ridiculously great.

Speaker 1:          09:01          What? Where's the money go? Well, this is what I'm saying to you. When Napster came along and then things change, do you think that's when the music business really got crazy? That's when they really say, look, we've got to start. We're not getting money from record sales anymore. When the record business, they can do the shit digitally. We've got to get a piece of that concert sales. We've got to get it, pick a piece of those tickets. We've got to get the merge, we gotta get everything we've got to solidify and we've got to make it still make it a big deal. And the quick stream monies pricks in the money grabbers from artists. Just rethink. Yeah, streaming through streaming and streaming seems like a more hostile version of it. But let me ask you, who do you think it's the money at the end of the day? Somebody, executives. It goes somewhere. You know when I watched this movie called Vinyl, you see that vibe. I haven't seen a documentary on whatever.

Speaker 1:          09:54          When it was out for a bit and Mick Jagger and uh, daisy Scorsese or Martin Scorsese, they did a pretty good job. They just got too into the characters brain going fucking crazy, right? And not enough of what was really going on. It was in near falls, right? Mick Jagger's, Solon was called the squeaky parts. There's the nasty parts and it showed the managers snort and blow and thinking how they can fucking take this and that. It was so easy. All the money was coming in to them. They were making deals with were the nasty parts weren't even signed to the label, but you hear them were assigned to the manager and the manager had a secret deal. Right. Sony. But you hear that about boxers have in shitty everybody. Creepy managers. You hear it about musicians, comedians, you, everything. I hope there's kids out there right now listening to this. They want to become lawyers and say, did it, it should be the wild wild west. Cause these nights it could be new. A new type of lawyer.

Speaker 2:          11:00          Okay.
