Speaker 1:          00:00          I can't be all the way. Don't think that applies to a British Iraqi gay nonbinary and also identifies as Muslim person. I think you're out of your line. I identity or lane Irish, Italian straight white male from Chicago who he'd like. I just think we don't need all these labels. You Glamor, you are allowed to be whoever you fucking want to be and I support the fuck out of who you are. Always do your shit. Well, it's almost always people that don't have a lot of other things going for them. Yeah. Cause you got to, you have to, when someone says Stephen Hawking's identifying as a British, he identifies a debt guy now when he was alive. Yeah. Brilliant. British physicist slash heterosexual atheist, a heterosexual identify who by the way was, um, uh, rebuttal freak riddled with infidelity. I've never met a guy, so not capable of, of cheating and found a way to cheat on his wife.

Speaker 1:          00:52          Well, apparently it gets still get it up. Oh, well apparently even though his body didn't move, his car could feel things. That was his sign. The scientist he used to go to was Eric Weinstein told me about this. I was like, what? He's like, yeah, he's a freak. And I was like, wait, what? And he's like, yeah, he used to go to strip clubs and there's like videos of him like rolling into a strip club in the wheelchair. Like he would go. That was his thing. Where'd you hear it littered with infidelity. Did you hear that? He cheated on his wife all the time. We were in that fucking movie. The, the whole reason that he, well, I mean the whole reason that he left his wife was because he fell in love with somebody else. But wasn't it like a nurse who was taking care of what the truth was that he was watching my balls.
