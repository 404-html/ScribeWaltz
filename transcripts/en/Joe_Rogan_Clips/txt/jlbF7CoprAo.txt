Speaker 1:          00:00          Be so good. He's so good in everything. Looks so young there. While he was man, man. Oh Man. What a fucking movie this was. Cause I wanted to believe so bad. Yeah. I so wanted to believe they got me. Hey, did you talk about Spielberg? Did you talk about that alien craft that came into her? What happened? We tend to our galaxy. It did then it won't the Hawaiian name. Oh, so it's over. You didn't hear about that one. The one that looks like a joint. Yeah, it looks like or a big piece of poop. Yeah. That's just a real big duty copter. It's just a weird rock. I think. Now they said that, uh, some like legit people said that it changed speed and went in different directions and people, legit people. Scientists. Oh, them guys said that it was a, it could be something.

Speaker 1:          00:46          Mm. Could be, what does Neil degrasse say about it? He's not talking right now. Yeah. He's in a little bit of a kerfuffle. Kerfuffle. What's his Jame Harvard scientists say aliens makes plain bizarre interstellar object. Yeah. I saw that. And then I saw someone refuting the scientists. Harvard. Nobody wants to believe more than me, bro. Come on Joe. It's real. Well, if I was going to mask my spaceship to fly through the galaxy, I would definitely make it look like a big rock. Like a big asteroid. Right. Why wouldn't you driving through space may. Maybe what they were like, look, if we just make this thing drive by them and don't change speeds, they'll now have no idea. They just think we're in the store and they'd be psyched that we miss them. Okay. Yeah. Good call. Good call. Someone just hits the gas. I'm tired.

Speaker 1:          01:38          I don't want it. It's fucking taking too long. Which he just decides. You got it. The fucking cops are behind is Dave Shit. God dammit. Dave, you're not supposed to just take off 65 you fuck that. Start throwing this weed out the window. Why would it be so hard to believe a space rock traveling through space? That would be the move, right? I mean if they are so advanced, they can travel through galaxies. They can make the shit look like anything they want it to. Why when you doll it up, radiation pressure. The only thing separating Thor's would be, well there's no air and space, right? So it wouldn't be aerodynamics. What would it be? Momentum. No, go down a little bit. Take it answers your question. If radiation pressure is the accelerating forest then own Mo Momma represents a new class of thin interstellar material. Whoa. It has a different thing for energy. What as to what may have produced this previously unseen material, it could have emerged naturally from the debris of the planet forming disk in a distant solar system going through yet an unknown process. They've got a whole nother way to makes, we went from Toyota Corollas to this thing.

Speaker 1:          02:51          Imagine if that's what we find. The only thing that I think what it does, the um, the like a rock, right? Rock hat is not smooth, but it doesn't necessarily need, this is where I'm stupid. This is one of one of many places where I'm stupid, but it doesn't necessarily need to be aerodynamic. Right? Cause it's not going through air. It's called you the vacuum of space. Right? Exactly. So I'm not wrong there. It could actually look like a rock. It could be the only issue would be getting it into space. Right. The aerodynamics is assuming that you shooting it from a planet with an atmosphere. Again, gravity not be talking about this way too stupid. No, let's go. Let's keep, let's keep going on about if you shot, if you'd like, if you're launching it from Earth into space, right? Yeah. What if you had it in cased in like this outer area, sort of like the space shuttle is, but then once you get to a place you could jettison the outside of it.

Speaker 1:          03:41          Just like they get rid of those booster rocket fall off. They just fall into the fucking land on people. Whether fishing, that's has to happen. Right. When she getting killed by a booster rocket, flat space, even in the face it didn't do great, but then they could do that. They could release the shell and then they would just have the rock and the rock would move through space. And it didn't matter what shape it was cause it's in the vacuum of space. We just get it up into orbit, orbit like uh, the space station. Go and build it in pieces and then launch it. Do you remember when that Commander Chris Hadfield gentlemen was on the podcast and he was talking about some kind of magnet that they have that uh, collects subatomic particles out there in the galaxy and that we only know 5% of what the universe is made out of?

Speaker 1:          04:30          Oh my God. Talking about things like dark matter and he was 5%. It's the guys scientist space, a real legit astronaut coming back from six months in space or whatever the fuck he was there for. And telling us this, we're like, wow, what we've talked about that like you can hang with those guys for a little while and then you're like, I don't understand what's happening now. Well it's also the, I mean it's amazing what we do know, amazing that they can send a guy to space and have them fly around the ISS or, yeah. I mean, we'll talk about what you were saying about why are we here and what are we doing? Like we haven't developed yet. Something that you can go the uh, the speed of light we haven't like, but if we do, then the whole universe is open to us.

Speaker 1:          05:15          Maybe that's what it is. Maybe the struggle of developing all this stuff is to get to a scientific level where we can really go. I don't think they think the speed of light is even good enough. Really. Yeah, I think, damn it, that was my goal. I think that like if you wanted to have options available as to what planet you're gonna colonize, you going to have to, who knows? Like what have you landed on the planet, what did he land on a planet? And it's like, Hey, it's 74 degrees out guys. Guys, it's all oxygen and nitrogen. It's just like earth. Come on out here. Come on out of here. But it's only been like that for 10 years and then it's a cycle. It's really fucked up. Like 30 years from now it's going to be a nice age. And then all of people have moved there and they're going to freeze to death.

Speaker 1:          05:59          It's going to be no food at all plan. It doesn't give a fuck. My Dad does all our science led us to that. I don't even know if we can predict, here's my question. Can they accurately predict the atmosphere and the conditions and like what the temperature would be if a planet is from a son, like do they have a calculation where they say, oh, this sun is this amount of big and this planet, it was this far away, so it's definitely going to stay within a certain temperature range for the entire time that the planet, did they know that like within like a death range. I don't know greys. That range is 40 degrees, bro. Yeah. You get to 140 that's a wrap. Yeah. You're done. Yeah, so like hundreds would make it 140 everyone's dead. Right? You live in in a sauna, you're going to run out of water. I just don't think we're going to make it.
