Speaker 1:          00:00          Well, one of the things that was so interesting about Australia is that in certain ways it's a more, you know, it's thought of as sort of a macho culture may be more masculine, a little bit more conservative than here generally, and yet the left has one, they're on so many of the major issues that we're fighting, we're killing each other over now. Universal healthcare, mandatory 401k ninth. It's like $18 minimum wage pensions, four weeks of vacation a year. Like I think they get maternity leave as well. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's just like so many of the things that here are up for grabs they already solved.

Speaker 2:          00:37          We have to take two things into consideration. One, um, that they have a small population, small in homogenous in its enormous place. You're dealing with a place as large as contiguous United States of America, but there's only 20 million people

Speaker 1:          00:50          because the Whitney, they were like, it's crowded in that restaurant. And it was like, you mean I don't have to wait for an hour to get in? They had no con they've never seen a crowd of people.

Speaker 2:          01:00          Yeah. They don't know what a real crowd is. And also I think their culture is less constrained by history because they came, they were essentially prisoners. I mean they, it's like several generations removed. Yeah. But it's not, not only that they not indigenous. No, I mean like the nonindigenous populations. Prisoners, yes. Um, yeah. Well they came from, they were sent there because England didn't want him and that's literally how the country got founded for like stealing a watch. Like they were low level. Okay, well then they sent them to the much better place. Oh yeah. Way Better. It's an a gold coast. You're like, Holy Shit. It just takes forever to get, if you're a Manchester, it's raining every day and like fuck this place and you, you, you know, you stole a watch and they shipped you off to the Gold Coast. You'd be like, what? Which has happened. This is hilarious. You fish out here. It's fucking beautiful. They're nice people. And I wonder if there, so nice. I feel like they are slightly less nice than Canadians who are way more nice than us.

Speaker 1:          02:01          I think that's right. I also think that they have, they have it so good that they're a little complacent and that makes me concerned because

Speaker 2:          02:10          China. Okay. Right. That's like the big story there. Yes. Yes. I see what you're saying. Yeah. Well you know, that is to be considered, but I think the United States, first of all, we have this momentum of innovation and of ass kicking and, and, and getting things done in creating things that's so different than any other part of the world. If we took that shit down a notch, I think we'd be okay. You know, I mean I think we definitely do have to worry about China and we, you know, I've been really trying to closely follow all this wowway stuff where these executives keep getting arrested and you know, it's the close relationship between some tech companies and this communist government is very confusing. But some people look it over. Like if you talk to people that are Chinese natives or who have been to China, they almost look it as a positive. There's less resistance. It's more, even though the censorship is open, it's at least you know what you're dealing with over there as opposed to, you know, the NSA is spying on us.

Speaker 1:          03:17          Oh, I don't buy it at all. I've seen some people make that argument and it's horrifying. Weird. It's weird. It's horrifying. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          03:25          Great. I agree with you. You do have to worry about China, but I think Australia is like, ah, it's fucking Americans to take care of it.

Speaker 1:          03:30          That's how they think sorta, except like their situation is that they're enormously economic. They're enormously dependent on China economically and they love having that money. Uh, but they seem to be a little bit like sleep walking through history and not is at least some people that I spoke to it. But that's, that's the real story in Australia is China.

Speaker 2:          03:55          Yeah. Well I think when you're, you're not a military might, you know, you're not like one of the big players. You're kind of like sitting back watching because what are we going to do? Like, what if Australia decides to ramp up its defense budget by 5000% over the next 10 years and develop a crazy arsenal of weapons and super soldiers and shoot them all up with steroids and give them exoskeletons and get ready to go to war, start building bunkers, right, and freak the rest of the world out. I mean this and take this like North Korea with money approach to the world. If any man in North Korea with money. Well, North Korea is basically like this scary spot that nobody wants to invade, even though we know that there's a military dictatorship there. They have, yeah, they have nuclear weapons. They have a mad man who's in control.

Speaker 2:          04:40          They have people that escaped with horrific stories and we have a president who talks about them as if they're sort of a normal country. Yeah. Well, in the weird thing is like he might be able to sit down with them and actually talked to them as his unconventional approach might actually lead to some sort of communication at least. Which is better than nothing, I guess. But, but if, I don't mean like in North Korea, like they take over the country and in prison it's people, I mean like there they become kind of dangerous and sketchy and small. Like North Korea is not a military Dick Power. Like in terms of like the way the Soviet Union is where they could take over the world, but they're scary but they're untouchable and that's scary. Exactly. If Australia became that then I think we have a totally different attitude about Australia. No, Australia. Yeah, we don't, yeah, Australia is just laid back and they're like, Hey Americans a take care of it and then we're over here building fucking walls and shooting missiles. Um, yeah. I, I would imagine it would be really weird to watch us from afar. You know, if you were paying attention to world politics,

Speaker 1:          05:38          they know everything. I mean everyone I talked to there was like, let's talk about gerrymandering in Virginia. And I'm like, what? Like what, what do you say that simply follow what's going on here? And the way that I found kind of amazing, like genuinely actually Gerrymandering, good Virginia. I was, I would move over there. Don't you often knew it was going on for a year. You know the answer is sort of note. Yeah. Comedians move over there. They move over there and become huge in Australia.
