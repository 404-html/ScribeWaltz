Speaker 1:          00:00          Try My day, Joe Rogan podcast by night all day. Do you think, what's the short drive? It? What's the shit? You've had a long career in MMA long and successful career, but it's very rare. It's very rare for someone to be operating at the same level that you're operating in is like the cutoff. Like once you get to about seven, everything starts to just rapidly declined. Like he'd just fall to shit. Do you think it's an injury thing? Is it a training thing? Is it just a life? They didn't, they didn't, uh, or at least they weren't able to single out any particular factor in, in general. But you know, there was a lot of theories as to why that might be, but they were able to track, uh, professional fighters careers, uh, over length of time. I think they had some metro having, I don't remember, but it's on the, it's on the Internet.

Speaker 1:          00:48          Uh, it, uh, I do believe that they accounted, they were able to account for a number of fights too and weigh that against that metric and see how that may influence things. But seven years was this magic number, like six, seven years. And once you start going over seven years, your, your success, your percentage of success started just crumbling. Like it was dramatic about how a guy would be like 13 and three and he'd get to seven years, then all of a sudden it's like 13, six, 13, seven, 13. He just starts losing just about everything. Yeah. Bj Penn's good example of that. Right. You know, look, there's certain, there's a certain drop off where the person just looks totally different and, and you know, we could honestly look, it would be, we would have to isolate a lot of different factors to figure out any one particular thing.

Speaker 1:          01:35          But there's so many elements that go into being a professional fighter and being successful at that. And so for let's say we'll take Bj, you know, maybe, maybe it is physicality, maybe he's lost a little bit of a step. His reactions are a little slower, uh, through any number of reasons why maybe his, his strength has diminished maybe slightly or is flexibility, maybe certain physical elements regardless of injury or not have diminished enough that at where they used to be. It was an edge where it is now is, is evened out or is or is below what is necessary for him and how he fights to be successful. Uh, maybe could be beyond physical deterioration. Maybe it's just mental. Yeah, exactly. So maybe he's just not as motivated to push in the same ways that he was or maybe he's not able to, I dunno, recognize, uh, things that he was five years ago, six years ago, and seeing those opportunities and being able to react on them quicker.

Speaker 1:          02:35          Uh, there's a number of things and especially when it comes to mental now, now you're getting into such a subjective area that, you know, go, go, pull that apart. That's a really good point. The mental aspect is a really good point because who knows, you know, the only, the only the person that's competing knows, we really never have any idea how, what's going on inside a person. Yeah. I mean, for me, I decided to take a after my Arlovski fight and that was somewhat physically based, but uh, most of it was mental. I, uh, I just didn't, I had no interest to go into any kind of training camp to put myself through all that again to then to fight again. You know, it's just for one when you start off fighting and what those goals are too, as you get further in and further in and further in and, you know, getting it 20 years of being a professional fighter and being a top 10 heavyweight, uh, and arguably and top five most of the time for Shit, 16 of them, something like that. At a high level competition. Yeah. And uh, it's just, and youngest, every UFC heavyweight champion, that's right. Until that, that, that son of a bitch, Jon Jones came and beat me out by a few months. That talented bastard. Now you're the youngest ever. Yeah, just heavyweight champion instead of the youngest ever UFC champion. But, um.
