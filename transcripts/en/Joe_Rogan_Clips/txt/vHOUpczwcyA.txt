Speaker 1:          00:00          Brian Richards, your friend, a wildlife biologist and um, well we're going to talk about a bunch of things, but one of the things that I wanted to talk about is this scary disease that uh, well when Ted Nugent was on the podcast, he downplayed the consequences and effects of something called CWD or chronic wasting disease, which has made it onto your farm and you live in Wisconsin and you have this beautiful place that we visited when we did the immediate or television show. And, um, this is a new thing that this chronic wasting disease was just, it just, it decimates the deer's health and kills them. And the suspicion is that some of this at least comes from these high fence operations where people grow dear, um, and treat them like, instead of like a wild animal, they treat them like a domesticated animal and have them all feeding off of the same pile of food and they share this disease. Is this all correct and accurate? Brian?

Speaker 2:          01:02          Boy, you just started out about an hour's worth of congress. Um, so yeah, just a little bit. I'm a, I'm allowed to let biologist with the national wildlife health center, US geological survey up in Madison, Wisconsin. And so, uh, one of the things that I spend a lot of time on is chronic wasting disease. I wouldn't say that makes me necessarily an expert, but I've gotten to know a lot of people that I would call experts over the years. So I've gained a little bit of outage. So I don't even mean your, your statement there. We could start a number of different places

Speaker 1:          01:35          this disease. Um, essentially just describe what it does do these animals and why it's such a major concern. It hasn't jumped to humans yet that we're aware of, that we're aware of, but it is a possibility, a very real possibility.

Speaker 2:          01:50          We can't rule it out at this point in time. Science is unable to rule it out. So, okay, that's a great place to start. Why would we care about this thing called chronic wasting disease? And I would argue in, in some other scientists have argued there's two major reasons. Number one is the impacts of this disease on members of the deer family themselves. And the other is that we cannot rule out the possibility that CWT could become a human health issue at some point down the road. Guys, you kind of nailed those two with regard to deer or members of the deer family, whitetail deer, mule deer, elk, Moose, and most recently it's picked up in, in reindeer, in Norway of all places. We could articulate some reasons, some rationale why this disease might be thought of as being important. First we'd look at it would be geographic spread.

Speaker 2:          02:42          So you know, CWD 20 years ago was thought to be this really novel thing in a very restricted geographic range and south eastern Wyoming, adjacent North Eastern Colorado, and maybe a little spill over and in Nebraska, a wildlife biologist, wildlife specialist, and looked at this disease. It was interesting. Uh, we didn't know much about it at that point in time, but it seemed to be very isolated there. What does it do to the deer? A kilter, right? But how does it kill him? Alright, so this is a member of a family of diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. These are [inaudible] so big long words. Transmissible means it can go from animal aid. Animal be spongiform means looks like a sponge and encephalopathy means disease of the brain, she put it together. And so this disease results in holes in the brain resulting in progressive neurological degeneration followed by death. Okay. It's a, it's a death sentence and there's no

Speaker 1:          03:44          war for it. It's all you can capture the deer and give them some sort of metal

Speaker 2:          03:48          cation, no cure for these diseases. The sweeter diseases co you know, there's a, there's a members of the TSC group of diseases in humans. Most familiar is, is one called [inaudible] disease. So it's very similar to mad cow disease in the same family. So, well I'd take [inaudible] you could say price, honestly, I would just read it. Um, that's an interesting, you know, there's, uh, uh, goes back and forth on whether it's pre honor, prion stand poisoner to receive the Nobel laureate for his work on these diseases. Coined the term to prion. And in his first publication describing these diseases, he did a phonetic spelling and it's prion. So other researchers, it's a especially, you know, um, some from across the pond. Um, say it's gotta be prion. And the main reason that, you know, some of them I've talked to about that is that an ERC stand poizner when he hears it called Prion. Oh, so we'll say Priyanka.

Speaker 1:          04:46          Yeah. So I'll say [inaudible] from now on. Now this disease which people know as mad cow disease, um, obviously, uh, is transmissible to humans. And, um, that's one of the reasons why people are very scared that this could potentially jump from deer into humans. And correct me if I'm wrong, but it also is making its way into the actual plants that these animals eat.

Speaker 2:          05:10          You, you're correct on both accounts show with BSE, mad cow disease, that was an interesting disease where it resulted from, in essence, turning cows into cannibals. We were, which all cyclists in New Guinea, right with KCC, Kirksville with, with crew, which is a human disease. A TSC likely started when, um, one individual developed Roitfeld Jacobes disease. That individual died. And as, as a practice was the practice in the, for a tribe in Papa New Guinea, uh, they practice ritualized cannibalism to honor the dead and to help release the spirits from, you know, deceased family members. So they would feed upon upon the corpse and Pour, you know, the bodies of their deceased. So when one individual died of probably have some variant of Coatesville Jakob's disease, then the causative agent, the prion protein, which is concentrated in the central nervous system and lymphatic systems of, you know, of disease patients.

Speaker 2:          06:12          This was fed back to other members of the family and the extended family. And so when they got sick and died veteran again, so we saw that with Kourou, um, in, uh, in the 19 [inaudible] 1960 [inaudible] around there, um, it was realized that this cannibalistic behavior was likely the result, you know, or the [inaudible] of the cause of disease transmission. Cannibalism was outlawed. And at that point in time, you broke completely the d disease transmission cycle. So no more new cases of Kourou, but they had lingering cases with an extended incubation period up to 40 years later before Kourou. Finally burned out of that population. So now with, with BSC or mad cow disease, we were doing exactly in essence the same thing, not exactly the same thing, but in essence. So in an effort to maximize production and reduce the amount of waste when they butchered cattle, we would take all the awful Oh FFA l you know, the high, the bones, the parts that are inedible and we would had rendered them, Cook them at high temperature and typically, you know, high pressure as well.

Speaker 2:          07:26          And it turns into a slurry high protein slurry. You skim the fat off the top of that and then dehydrate the rest of it. And you have, you know, kind of a meat and bone meal, a high protein supplement, realizing that cattle grow faster and produce better when they're, when on a hyper higher protein diet, it seemed reasonable to use waste material from cows to feed back to cows. So at some point, turning, turning, turning thousand, the candles. So at some point in time a cow developed a TSC, a prion disease, whether it came from scrapey, the TSC of sheep or arose on its own is unknown, but that cow died. It was rendered into meat and bone meal and there's high protein feed was then fed out to hundreds to thousands. And correct me if I'm wrong, for these prions, they can survive up to more than a thousand degree temperature.

Speaker 2:          08:20          Yeah. Surviving is kind of a, a strange term, Joe in the, they're not alive. Start with, it's a protein a, they can persist, they cannot be inactivated. So yeah, it to, he's pretty Harley. These premiums are not necessarily a living thing like a disease or a virus or a bacteria. Well there a disease causing agent, but they are incredibly unique. They're sitting there and eating Hologic agent like a virus or bacteria or a parasite could be causing disease. But all these other things have genetic material. They're alive, which allows them to change rapidly to evolve over time. So the whole concept that you have a protein, a protein that all mammals produce in a normal form can be converted after production into a disease associated form that has these radically different characteristics. One that you mentioned was, you know, resistance to heat, heat treatment, a normal prion protein, and we have billions of them circulating in our bodies right now.

Speaker 2:          09:24          Um, have a specific purposes, cellular purpose, we don't know exactly what it is when it's likely involved in some sort of intracellular communication. It's a string of around 250 amino acids, so relatively short protein. It does whatever it's does, and then the body recycles, breaks that chain of amino acids down into its component parts and recycles it. It turns out that normal cellular premium protein likely has a half life of maybe four to six hours. Okay, so you're producing them relatively constantly. Then there's the disease associated form in all diseases associated prions start as the normal cellular Priya. So they're converted from one, three dimensional form to a different form. Okay. And this different form has these radically different characteristics. One is heat resistance and other is UV light resistance. Um, I mentioned that the normal cell prion protein has a half life of maybe four to six hours. The disease associated ones can persist in the environment for years and potentially up to decades. Okay. And when you say persistent,

Speaker 1:          10:30          the environment, you mean in like on the ground on leaves on like how, how would they be

Speaker 2:          10:36          persistence? Yeah, all of those things jump through. So if a deer, we'll share [inaudible] infectious agent, this prion protein. And so from the time of deer is infected, it's probably around two years before it develops. Clinical signs of disease goes down, he'll lose as it's fear, a human's dramatic weight loss. Um, all of those things, that incubation period, it's probably shedding infectious agent for the vast majority of that time period. So it looks healthy, but it's able of transmitting disease. We'd call that Ala typhoid Mary Syndrome Syndrome.

Speaker 1:          11:13          The two deer that we, uh, that were positive on our farm to box two and a half year old bucks were we had them tested. As you know, we're, for the last several years we've been getting, uh, initially we got our, uh, only bucks tested and then the last three or four years we've gotten all the deer tested. They were a two and a half year old bucks, perfectly look, perfectly healthy. And these are the first ones that you've tested that tested positive and we tested in excess of 35 deer over the last, well more than that, but it would be more like 50 during the incubation period. Would they still test positive at some point? They will at some point. So that could be spreading infectious agents testing positive.

Speaker 2:          11:54          Yes. Oh, that's fun. So it's say it's probably between three and six months out when we can test an animal test positive, but it's likely shedding infectious agent at least at lower quantities prior to that point in time. And so then, so it's shedding infectious agent. It's capable of transmitting disease and cave long before it looks clinically ill. That's, that's one of the real challenges with this disease. From a management standpoint. They look perfectly healthy, they act perfectly healthy, but they're starting to have that progressive neurological degeneration that we can only see very near the end of disease. So, correct me if I'm wrong, but this seems like we could potentially be facing a ticking time bomb of many, many, many deer that are wandering around out there right now that look totally normal, that are spreading this stuff all over the place and they're, they're acting normally look perfectly healthy.

Speaker 2:          12:51          And then obviously with this multi year incubation period, this kid just cascade. And I think we've seen evidence of that now. Um, started at, you know, he talked about being isolated disease. It was picked up in Wisconsin at the end of 2001. Um, as of today, CWD has been, now Penn picked up in 25 states in captive and or free ranging populations in whitetail deer, mule deer, elk or Moose, two Canadian provinces, uh, in addition to two is picked up in South Korea. And that was real interesting. It was in captive elk and those elk still had Canadian ear tags in them. So we pretty much know how CWD those Elkton swim across the Pacific pond. Most recently it was picked up, uh, two years ago in free ranging reindeer in Norway. And subsequent to that, it was picked up in a small handful, like three or four moose and a red deer in Norway in a single moose in Finland.

Speaker 2:          13:54          It's a real concern over in Norway, um, with reindeer. Okay. So reindeer are very gregarious. Yeah. Whitetail deer, Caribou, Caribou, reindeer. So not unusual to see him in herds of hundreds of animals. So very, very different than what we see with whitetail deer, mule deer, elk, or Moose. We don't see those huge hurts. But with elk, you can in the wintertime. But anyway, it's thought that this gregarious behavior might really facilitate transmission and reindeer. Right? So when it was picked up in reindeer, Norway said, you know, we maybe should do something. It's an interesting story. And then, um, you know, Norway has got experience with scrapey and sheep, uh, and so they'd have a long history. What does scrimping scrapey is the same as well. It's the same family diseases in sheep. It's actually the first one that was described scrapey we've known since the early 17 hundreds a disease, a domestic sheep, and it's called scrapey because of the behavior these animals, once they enter the clinical phase of disease display and they, they seem like they itch bat.

Speaker 2:          15:05          And so they'll go up to fence post and other objects and they literally rub their hide off of their body. So that's the name scraping. And it's the same progressive neurological disorder followed by death. And I think about it. So as this disease creates vacuums in the brain, it's killing off neurons. And so without those neurons firing, you fall into that progressive degeneration. And yet at some point your body can no longer survive. And that's what's really spooky about how this thing kills. So anyway, go back to Norway when they detected CWT. Trying to keep this a little bit closer to you. You're very soft spoken. Oh, no worries. I can hear myself. Plenty of the problem is the recording. Sorry. Okay, no worries. So when they picked up CWD and reindeer in Norway and the researchers over there had witnessed what we are lack of success on this side of the pond over the course of the last 20 years.

Speaker 2:          16:01          And they took it very, very seriously. Um, so they took kind of some harsh medicine. Uh, they announced their plans that they were going to eliminate a herd unit. They were going to kill every rain deer in an entire herd unit in Norway. The idea is to eliminate the host population. It's called stamping out and it works in a pen. This is the first time had been done realistically in a free ranging population. Oh, ideas. We don't have effective tools for management. It's disease. They were very fearful of what would happen if this spread throughout that reindeer population and throughout other reindeer herds. And like Alaska, they have multiple herds. Like last year I hunted Caribou with, with Steve up in the 40 mile river area. But there were, you know, and so they're very localized. This is probably not, but at least they have a range that they move through.

Speaker 2:          16:54          So, and in Norway they have two or three different herds, many more than that. So I don't know exactly how many heard points you could isolate one of the herd. So the idea is before they get to be any worse before it gets any farther, let's take it out. So they had a hunting season. They allowed a hunter's to take as many as they could, which was a little over a thousand reindeer. And then they came in with government agents. But it's sharp concern that the hunters could eat something with CWD and then catch it. Well, that's always a concern. But what we can talk about human, let me finish this one up though, with Norway in it, they took, literally took the bull by the horns. They decided to do what was very unpopular. What we have not been able to do in North America, they, and so after the hunting season, government agent sharpshooters took an additional 1400 reindeer as they killed every reindeer in this herd unit. And they're going to, it fallow, allow no reindeer in there for a minimum of five years. So it says every bit of promise of being the first large scale success with dealing with this disease in a free ranging heard pretty different than what we've been able to accomplish over here.
