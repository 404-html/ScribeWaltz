Speaker 1:          00:00          So there's a point to be made. If you, I understand you want a healthy, like you, you want Twitter to grow, you need it to grow. The shareholders needed to grow that advertisers need to advertise. So you've got all these restrictions, but allowing people to say these awful things, make sure we stay away from them and it allows us to avoid certain people. And it isn't an important to know that these people hold these beliefs. If you get rid of him, you know, someone could walk into a business and you wouldn't even know that they were in Neo Nazi, but if they were high profile saying there things, you'd be like, that's the guy at home. Like you're absolutely right. This is like one of my favorite sayings is that sunlight is the best disinfectant and it's so, so, so true. I like one of the biggest problems with censorship is the fact that you pushed people underground and you don't know what's going on.

Speaker 1:          00:41          And this is something I worry about. It's not that I don't worry if you ban people for these roles. I also worry about driving people away from the platform and affecting their real lives. So what we're trying to find this right balance and I hear you like you may not think we're drawing the lines in the right place and we get that feedback all the time and we're always trying to find the right places. But I worry as much about like the underground and like being able to shine a light on these things is as anything else.

Speaker 2:          01:08          I think it's a cost benefit analysis and we have to constantly rehash it and do it. Like we, we have the technology we have today and we are looking at technologies which opened up the aperture even more and we all agree that a binary on or off is not the right answer and is not scalable. We have started getting into nuance within our enforcement and we've also started getting into nuance with the presentation of, of content. So you know, one path might have been for some of your replies for us to just remove that, those, you know, offensive replies completely. We don't do that. We hide it behind an interstitual to protect the original tweeter and, and, and also folks who don't want to see that they can still see everything. They just have to do one more top. So that's one solution. Ranking is another solution, but as technology gets better and we get better at applying to it, we have a lot more optionality whereas we don't, we don't have that as much today.

Speaker 1:          02:12          I feel like, I'm just going to reiterate an earlier point though, you know, if you recognize sunlight is the best disinfectant, you're, it's like you're, you're chasing after a goal that can never be met. If you wanna. If you want to protect all speech and they start banning certain individual, you want to, you want to increase the amount of healthy conversations, but you're banning some people. Well, how long until this group is now funded by that group? How long until you've banned everybody? I hear you.

Speaker 2:          02:33          I don't believe a permanent ban promotes health. I don't believe that. But we, we have to, we have to work with the technologies, tools and conditions that we, that we have today. So and evolve over over time to where we can see examples. Um, like, uh, this woman at the Westboro Baptist Church who was using Twitter every single day to spread hate against the Lgbtqa community. And over time we had, I think it was three or four folks on Twitter who would engage her every single day about what she was doing. And she actually left the church, Michael Phelps. She's amazing. And she is, she's not pulling her family out of that as well. And you could make the argument that if we banned that account early on, she would have never left the church. I completely hear that. We, we get it. It's, it's just,

Speaker 1:          03:24          well, so let's, let's, I just want to make sure we had, we're advancing the conversation too and not just going to go back. So, uh, I'll just ask you this. Have you considered allowing some of these people permanently banned it back on with some restrictions? Maybe you can only tweet twice per day, maybe you can't retweet or something to that effect. I think we're very early in our thinking here. So we're, we're open minded to how to do this. I think we agree philosophically that permanent bans aren't extreme case scenario and it shouldn't be one of our, you know, regular use tools in our tool chest. So how we do that I think is something that we're actively talking about today. Is there a timeline that we can so, so look in all loving dad would fix a lot of problems. I think so, yes.

Speaker 1:          04:01          I really do. Like, I'm just curious like are you thinking like bands of a year or five years, 10 years? I'm just curious like what is, what is a reasonable ban in this kind of context? I think reasonably so much enough to state their case as to why they want to be unbanned. Like someone should have to have a like, um, uh, well measured, considerate response to what they did wrong. Did, do they agree with what they did wrong? Maybe perhaps saying why they don't think they did anything wrong and you could review it from there. Hmm. I think, um, you know, one of the challenges, we have the benefit in English common law of hundreds of years of precedent and developing new rules and figuring out what works and doesn't, Twitter is very different. So I think with the technology, I don't know if you need permanent bans or even, or even suspensions at all, you could literally just, uh, I mean, lock someone's account is essentially suspending them.

Speaker 1:          04:49          But, uh, I, I again, I, I wouldn't claim to know anything about the things that you go through, but what if you just restricted most of what they could say? You know, you blocked certain words in a certain dictionary. If someone's been, if someone was greased hill, oh, but no, but, but, but the thing about it this way, is it better that they're permanently banned or sound better, but it's not, it's not good. I don't know to think about it this way. Instead of being suspended for 72 hours, you get a dictionary block from paid speech words.

Speaker 2:          05:13          Right.

Speaker 1:          05:15          That makes sense. If people just use kind of language, this is what we see all the time. Yeah. Good move.
