Speaker 1:          00:00          I got that in Mexico. I was hoping it holds joints. Does it do anything it takes to open hall would be a good size to hold joints or not. So is that a joint or is it a cigar? No. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:20          It's um, marijuana inside of a tobacco. Okay. So it's like plush plot tobacco pause. Never had that. Yeah. I think I tried one once. Come on man. Probably camp cause stockholders, right? I mean it's legal, right? It's totally legal. Okay. How does that work? Do People get upset at you if you do certain things? A backhoe and marijuana in there. That's all it is.

Speaker 3:          00:48          Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:49          Did the combination of tobacco and marijuana is wonderful? First turned onto it by Charlie Murphy and then reignited by Dave Chappelle. Hey plus whiskey. Exactly. Perfect. Balances it out. Oh yeah. Alcohol is a drug that's been grandfathered in. Well, it's not just a drug, it's a drug that gets a bad rap because you could just have a little, it's crate fine. Yeah. Little sip here and there. And you just see your inhibitions are relaxed and it shows your true self and hopefully you're more joyous. And friendly and happy and everything's good. The real worry is the people that can't handle it, like the real worried about people who can't handle cars that can go zero to 60 in 1.9 seconds or anything. Have you ever considered something that like imagine if one day everyone has a car that's on the same, at least technological standard is one of your cars and everyone agrees that the smart thing to do is not just to have bumpers but to perhaps have some sort of a magnetic repellent device, something, some electro magnetic field around the cars. As cars come close to each other, they automatically radically decelerate because of magnets or something. Well, I mean now cars brake automatically brake. Yeah. When they see things, yes, but look a physical barrier like

Speaker 3:          02:16          okay,

Speaker 1:          02:16          uh, well the wheels work pretty well. Yeah, no pretty well decelerated at one point, one to 1.2 gs, that kind of thing.

Speaker 2:          02:26          Is there a concern that one day all your cars would be on the road and there they'll still be regular people with regular cars 2030 years from now, that will get in the mix and be them the main problem.

Speaker 1:          02:42          Yeah, I think it would be sort of like, yeah, it was a time of transition where there were horses and gasoline cars in the road at the same time. I been pretty weird. Ah, that'd be the weirdest. Yeah, I had, horses were tricky. You know, back in Manhattan had like 300,000 horses. You figure like Hello Horse Lives 15 years, got 20,000 horses. Dot. Robin Dad every day. However, every year, I should say every year is 20,000 horses. If this 300,000 was his 15 year lifespan.

Speaker 3:          03:12          Okay.

Speaker 2:          03:13          Bagging in the gangs in New York days.

Speaker 3:          03:16          That movie.

Speaker 1:          03:17          Yeah. Yeah. It's a lot of dead horses and then you need a host move the horse. Right. The probably a good [inaudible] pretty freaked out if they have to move or Ted hose because you think they know what's going on. Yeah. I mean it's pretty weird. No, I would imagine my dragon, this dead horse around and I'm a horse.

Speaker 2:          03:37          Do you ever stop and think about your role in civilization? Do you ever stop and think about your role in the culture? Cause me as a person who never met you until today, when I think of you, you know, I've always thought of you as being this weirdo super inventor dude who just somehow or another keeps coming up with new shit. But there's not a lot of you out there like everybody else seems to be. I mean, obviously you make a lot of money in. There's a lot of people that make a lot of money. He liked that clock. Yeah. Pretty Dope. Right? This is a great clock. Yeah. He want one. I'll get you one. Sure. Okay. Dawn, I like weird things like this. Oh, this is the coolest is TGT promotion. What is his TGT studios? Tgt Studios. Yeah. Yeah. Um, to a gentleman who makes all this by hand.

Speaker 2:          04:25          Yeah. It's really cool. Let's study is filled with where devices. Well, get ready for another one. All right. I'm sending it your way. You want to Werewolf to hook you up. All right. I, I'll take one. One, a werewolf and one clock coming up. Do you think about your role in the culture? Cause me as a person who never met you until today, I've always looked at you and like, wow, like how's this guy just keep inventing shit. Like how do you, how do you keep coming up with all these new devices and what do you ever consider how anew? Like I had a dream once that there was a million Tesla's instead of like one Tesla, there was a million, Tesla's not Chesley the car, but Nicola. Oh yeah, sure. And that in his day there was a million people like him who were radically innovative.

Speaker 2:          05:15          It was a weird dream, man. It was so strange. And I've had it more than once resulted in a very rapid technology innovation, that's for sure. It's one of the only dreams in my life. I've had more than one time. Okay. Like where I've woken up and it's in the same dream, in the same dream. And in this dream, it's 1940 [inaudible] 1950s but everyone is severely advanced. There's flying blimps with like LCD screens in the side of him and everything is bizarre and strange and it stuck with me for whatever it, obviously this is just a stupid dream, but for whatever reason, all these years that stuck with being like, it takes one man like Nikola Tesla to more than a hundred inventions that were patents. Right? I mean he had some pretty great, pretty fucking amazing ideas. Yes. But there was in his day, there was very few people like him. It's true. What if there was a million? Like what is this advanced? Very quickly. Right? But there's not a million. Elon Musk's is one motherfucker. Do you think about that? Or you just try to not, hmm.

Speaker 2:          06:35          I don't think, I don't think you'd necessarily want to be me don't think. Well, what's the worst part about you? People would like it that much. Well, most people wouldn't, but they can't be you. So that's like, that's like some superhero type shit. You know, you wouldn't want to be Spiderman when others sleep tight. And Gotham city. I hope he's out there doing his job. It's very hard to turn it off. Yeah. What's the hardest part? Might sound great, but what if it doesn't turn off now I showed you the isolation tank and you've, you've never experienced that before? No. I think that could help you turn it off a little bit just for the night. Yeah. Just give you a little bit of sleep. A little bit of perspective is magnesium that you get from the water as well that makes you, it makes you sleep easier because the water has Epsom salts in it, but maybe some sort of strategy for sacrificing your a biologic or not sacrificing but enhancing your biological recovery time by figuring out a way, whether it's through meditation or some other ways to shut off that, that thing at night.

Speaker 2:          07:45          Like you must have like a constant stream of ideas. It's running through your head all the time. You getting text messages from checks? No. Uh, I, I'm getting text messages for, from friends. Like what the hell are you doing smoking weed? Is that bad for you? It's legal. It's got to be an approved, it's not, you know, uh, I'm not a regular smoker if we'd, how often you smoke it? Almost never.

Speaker 3:          08:16          Hmm.

Speaker 2:          08:19          I mean it's, it's, I don't actually notice any effect. Well, there you go. There was a time where I think it was Ron doss or someone gave some Buddhist monk a bunch of acid. Okay. And he ate it and it had no effect on them. I doubt that. I would say that too, but I've never meditated to the level that some of these people have where they're constantly meditating all day. They don't have any material possessions and all of their energy is spent trying to achieve a certain mindset. I would like to cynically deny that. I'd like to cynically say Tay just fucking the same way I do. They just hang out with flip flops on and make weird noises. But maybe, no, you know, I, I know a lot of people like weed and that's fine, but I don't find that it is very good for productivity for you.

Speaker 2:          09:13          Not For me. Yeah. It's D. I mean, I would imagine that for someone like you, it's not someone like you, it, it'd be more like a cup of coffee. Right? You want to, you have a latte. Yeah. It's more like the opposite of a cup of coffee. It's like a cup of coffee and reverse. Oh, weed is, yeah, no, I'm saying you would like more, more like what would be beneficial to you? It'd be like coffee. I like to get things done. I like to be useful. Um, that is one of the hardest things to do is it will be useful. When you say you like to get things done in terms of like what get done, you satisfaction when you complete a project, when something, something that you invent comes to fruition and you see people enjoying it. That feeling yes. Doing something useful for other people that I liked doing. That's interesting for other people.

Speaker 3:          10:05          Okay.

Speaker 2:          10:06          Yes. So that, do you think that that is maybe the way you recognize that you have this unusual position in the culture where you can uniquely influence certain things because of this? I mean, you essentially have a gift, right? I mean you would think it was a curse, but I'm sure it's been fueled by many, many years of discipline and learning, but you essentially have a gift and that you have this radical sort of creativity engine when it comes to innovation and technology. It's like you're just, you're going at a very high rpms all the time. What does that Alexa stop? I don't know what would happen if I got into a sensory deprivation tank. Let's try. It sounds more concerning. It's like running the engine with no resistance that maybe it's not. Maybe it's fine. I don't know how I'll try it. I'll try it. Have you ever is fine? Did we experimented with meditation or anything? Yes. What do you do or what have you done? Rather I read, just sort of sit there and be quiet and then repeat some mantra which acts as a focal point. It's does still the mind. It is still the mind,

Speaker 2:          11:34          but I don't find myself drawn to it frequently.

Speaker 3:          11:38          Okay.

Speaker 2:          11:39          Do you think that perhaps productivity is maybe more attractive to you then enlightenment and like, or even the concept of whatever enlightenment means. Like, what are you trying to achieve when you're meditating all the time? Did you? It seems like almost like there's a frantic notice to your creativity that comes out of this, this burning furnace and fruit. In order for you to like calm that thing down, he got through, he may might have to throw too much water on it. It's like a never ending explosion. Like what does it like? I try to explain it to a dumb person like me.

Speaker 3:          12:20          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          12:20          What's going on in her end? Never running explosion. It's just constant ideas. Just bouncing around. Yes. Whew. Damn. Yeah, so when everybody leaves, just Ilan sitting at home brushing his teeth. Just bunch ideas bouncing around your head. Yeah, all the time. When did you realize that that's not the case with most people? I think when I was, I dunno, five or six or something, I thought I was insane.

Speaker 3:          12:54          Okay.

Speaker 2:          12:55          Why'd you think you were insane? Because it was clear that other people did not. What? Their mind wasn't exploding with ideas all the time. They were an expressing it. They weren't talking about it all day and you realize by the time you were five or six like oh they're probably not even getting this thing that I'm getting.

Speaker 3:          13:13          No. It was just strange. Who was like, hmm, that's strange.

Speaker 2:          13:22          That was my conclusion. I asked range. But did you feel diminished by it in any way? Like knowing that this is a weird thing that you really probably couldn't commiserate with with other people, they wouldn't understand. You hope they wouldn't find out. Cause I might like put me away with something. You sought that for a second. Yes. When you were little. Yeah. And the other people are wearing, what are they put me away like when you were little, you thought this? Yeah. Wow. Like you thought this is so radically different than the people that are around me. If they find out I got this stream coming in.

Speaker 3:          13:55          Yeah. Wow.

Speaker 2:          13:59          But you know, I was only like five or six. So do you think this is like, I mean there's, there's outliers biologically. You mean there's people that are seven foot nine. There's people that have giant hands is people that have eyes that are 20, 15 vision. There's always the outliers.

Speaker 3:          14:19          MMM.

Speaker 2:          14:21          Do you feel like you like caught this? Like you have got some you like on some weird innovation, creativity sort of wave that's very unusual. Like you, you tapped into, I mean, just think of the, the, the, the various things you've been able to accomplish in a very short amount of time and you're constantly doing this. That's a weird, you're weird person, right? I agree. Yeah. Like what if there's a million Elon Musk's?

Speaker 3:          14:54          Okay,

Speaker 2:          14:54          well that would be very weird. Ooh, Woo. Yeah. It'd be pretty weird. I agree. Real weird. Definitely. Yeah. What if there are a million show rockets? Oh, there probably is. There probably too many. And I mean, I think that's the case with, uh, a lot of folks. Yeah. I mean, but like, uh, you know, my goal, I was like, try to useful things,

Speaker 1:          15:27          try to maximize the, probably the future is good. Um, make the future exciting. Something you look forward to, you know, you know with the, you know with Tesla were like try and make things that people love it. I was like not okay, I can't how many, how many things can you buy that you really love that really give you joy? So rare, so rare. I wish there were more things. That's what we're trying to just make things that somebody loves. Okay.

Speaker 2:          15:59          When you, when you think about making someone loves, like do you specifically think about like what things would improve people's experience? Like what, what would change the way people interface with life that would make them more relaxed or more happy.

Speaker 3:          16:17          Okay.

Speaker 2:          16:18          You really think like when you thinking about things like that, is that what one of your considerations? Like what, what can I do that would help people that maybe they wouldn't be able to figure it out?

Speaker 1:          16:29          Yeah. Like, like what are the set of things that can be done to make the future better? Like you know, like, so I think the future where we are a space fairing civilization and out there among the stars, this is very exciting. This makes me look forward to a future just makes me want that future. You know, the things that need to be, things that make you look forward to waking up in the morning. You wake up in the morning, you look forward to the day before to the future and a future where we are spacefaring civilization and out there among the stars. I think that's a fair, exciting. That is a thing we want. Whereas if, if you knew we would not be a space frank civilization, but forever confined to Earth, this would not be a good future. That would be very sad. I think

Speaker 2:          17:20          it'd be so that you're sure of the, the just the finite lifespan and the earth itself and the solar system itself, that even though it's possibly, you know what I mean? How many, how long do they feel like this sun and the solar system's going to exist? How many hundreds of millions of years?

Speaker 1:          17:38          Well, it's probably, if you're saying that, when does the sun boil the ocean, right?

Speaker 2:          17:46          About 500 million years. So is, is it sad

Speaker 1:          17:50          that we never leave because in 500 million years that happens? Is that what you're saying?

Speaker 3:          17:56          Okay.

Speaker 1:          17:57          No, I just think like if there are two futures and one futurists were out there among the stars and the things we read about and see in science fiction movies, the good ones are true and we have these starships and we're, which we're going to see what other planets are like. And we're a multi planet species and the scope and scale of consciousness is expanded.

Speaker 3:          18:21          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:21          The Cross many civilizations in many planets and many star systems, this is a great future. This is a wonderful thing to me and that's what we should strive for.
