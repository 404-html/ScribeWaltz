Speaker 2:          02:01          Well, I'm over here smoking the weed. Daddy smoked, you know what I'm saying? But Netflix next week I'm probably going to tell them new asshole. They came out last night to see uncle Joey. I was dropping fucking dog. No jokes on him. His Shit. I'm ready to go dog therapy right now just listening to dogs by pink Floyd therapy. Then I'm going to pop up fucking podcast and I'm doing a few spots that I had to let these mother fuckers know who's running things. And I said Phil against Wonderboy and my man against the other guy. I watch it tonight. I'm tape

Speaker 1:          02:42          Joey, what time? What time are you tapings on June 4th

Speaker 2:          02:47          seven and 9:00 PM in Las Vegas.

Speaker 1:          02:50          And where at? Where are the, where are they filming that

Speaker 2:          02:53          downtown? I think someplace they got, it's a small place. Joe was made for us. It's like a seats less than the original room. Nice and tight. Really. It's like, it's like Providence, Rhode Island. When was the last time you went to providence? Probably years ago. That comedy connection. Fucking deadly. It's deadly. And so is this is the same type of layout to 50 to 40? Are there tickets available? Uh, there's no tickets available. I mean, there's something for you. You know what I'm saying? Right. If you, if you show up in the helicopter, I can't deny it. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          03:31          Power Copter than what you'll know days. You know what I'm saying? You just walk in and take the fucking mic and tell people what's time. But it's beautiful. But that's it. There's nothing available. I can't wait for people to see that special. Joey's going to be fucking nuts. I can't really, I'm working hard. I've never worked this hard in my life. I didn't know the meaning of this. And so I listen to you or the tapings and the try and shit. And now I'm just doing 28 minutes sexual all week, 28 28 28 Oo, I got to get the big, I got to get the beginning more jazzed up because I got to make them watch. So I got to go out there like a fucking medial, you understand me? I got to go out there and holds him to like 14 minutes and let them, I got the strategy.

Speaker 2:          04:11          I'm going to go out there and fucking just go off for about 14 then we go to watch different corners and then they come on, I pick my shots. I just picked my fucking shots like when fucking, uh, Eddie's guys fought that dude and he fucking took the really good striker. I gotta pick my shots in the second round and then the third round go out there and just fucking four point combinations ending with leg kicks the ted down than the, until you can't take it no more. You know what I'm saying? That's the strategy, right? Then I'm breaking it down to three rounds. Joe Rogan, you did it. You did last night. The Ice House said, I told, I told Rodney, set them on fire man. Yeah, no, no, no. I broke it down to three rounds and I'm cutting not in an addict. You know what I'm saying?

Speaker 2:          04:57          I'm cutting. I'm looking at it like an MMA fighter. So I'm training for a fight. So the first 11 minutes you guys fucking, I got to jump on your criminal shit. The whole fucking old school. Old School veto the second round. I'm just picking my shots like, like a guy gets Edson Barboza he picked his shots, he picked them apart. He kicked him in the side. He fucked up that sciatic nerve. He kicks him in the body and then the third round I come out like fucking that black dude in the 70s that sport when they gave him the bottle filled with cocaine, milk Joe Rogan fuckers don't know magic bottle. Same One Dana brought out for the fight against out though. It's kind of Mcgregor. That's the same one that gave fucking don't tell me I know the characteristics of that fucking milk.

Speaker 1:          06:00          Fuck you pick you're dealing with in the third round we'd come out like Brian was that trainer's name? Uh, is that a manual? Joe Rogan. We're watching it right now. Jamie. Just put it on Alexis, our guayle. Alexis Aguayo. Aaron Pryor. Panama Lewis gave him the bottle with the original should it shouldn't know Diego was sending up. Yeah, he gave me tell him some coconut water though. Looking back and then Aaron Pryor came out just throwing bombs and fucked Alexis Aguayo up. That was a great fight, man. This is the way you gotta do it, man. Old School boxing. Aaron Pryor, the bottle. It's fights up bottles. I called the bottle that I said get on the bottle that I mixed. Did they capture that on video? It has a bottle.

Speaker 1:          06:58          Give him the bottle that I met with smoke coming out of it. I wonder what the fuck was in that thing. Cocaine. Damn. He's doing work. Look it up. Where's the box? I'll get the other one. The one that I'm mixed. Look at it. Okay. There's no, no, no, not that one. Give me the other one. Okay. How fucking beautiful. It's that that's one bottle sniff and shit. No, that they try to get more than, that was the one he goes. Give me that one. Yeah. Bang. He got hurt before he fucked out. Alexis Aguayo had a nasty right hand man. He was watery, his shit long. So this is not the main event, is it? Yeah. This is the main event. Can we are all right, let's go right back to, to the fight, Joey. We're about to watch one the boyfriends until we love you, man.
