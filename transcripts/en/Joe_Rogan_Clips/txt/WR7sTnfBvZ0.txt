Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah. And, and I think that, um, you know, so like shoulder to shoulder person a person, I feel like a bit of a disconnect, you know? But social media, like we get to share information sometimes not good information, sometimes good information, like the fact that people are communicating I think is important. Um, it's, it's making people take stands on things that they're all finding out. Oh, you believe that too? Or I think that too, like cool. Like I can find my people, you know? But on the actual like oxytocin, like social side, people actually getting to know each other, like those like intimate relationships. Like I feel like that part is, is suffering a little bit from it.

Speaker 2:          00:37          I think that suffering a little bit in real life because people were in cars, they're in traffic, they're isolated than they go to work and they're in a cubicle all day and they'd get home. They're in their apartment or their house. Yeah. There's not a lot of like interaction with people and just think this is just a side effect of modern life. You know? It's weird that there's so many, like in La, there's so many people next to each other and almost nobody knows their neighbor. It's very strange. What I'm talking about is I think countries are stupid like states. I think countries like states, like I think we should build a wall over Florida before we should build a wall for Mexico. I mean, I mean Florida is a state, right? But Florida is just as alien as like say Finland or something like that.

Speaker 2:          01:22          I mean it's just, just the fact that you can move out of Florida and they're like, fuck Florida, man, I'm going to, I'm going to move to Atlanta. And he'd go up there and like, nobody stops you. You just go. But if you're in Tiawana like you like no dog, there's a fence up here, pitch like this. No, there's no crossing did. To me that seems like super fucking strange and almost like guaranteeing that those spots are fucked forever. And the only way those anything's ever going to level out is if you let anybody travel wherever they want. And nobody's willing to do that because it might fuck up the good spots. Like la Jolla would be like, no, no, no. You can't just like, yeah, you can't just come over from, I mean you think about it, La Jolla has some of the wealthiest real estate in the world, right? And unbelievable. Beautiful views. And you could walk to Mexico from La Jolla. You could walk, I mean, what's the distance between Tijuana and La Jolla? Let's guess. Let me guess. I'm gonna say it's 50 miles. Is it 50

Speaker 1:          02:19          I'm going to say 50 no, I, it's not that many cause it's already depending on, oh yeah. I would say it's a 30 minute drive. Like, like moderate, normal speed limit. No traffic. 35 yeah, maybe.

Speaker 2:          02:33          So maybe it's 30 miles. So it's like a marathon or a marathon run. Which people do. They run it all. They run marathons all top 2030 to 32 miles 30 so you're in fucking tier one or you were in a third world country and one of the worst neighborhoods of a third world country and 32 miles away. You have like these unbelievable mansions on these bluffs overlooking the ocean, like Nigga, that shit. That's crazy. That's crazy. And Auto, it's very weird. Yeah, exactly. It's very weird. Yeah. And I, and yeah, that corn, Otto the island, that's all super wealthy people. Right? That's where Dick Cheney lives apparently.

Speaker 1:          03:18          Yeah. They, they have the ability of shutting that whole island down. If there's like vandalism or like, cause it's, it's got its entry and it's out like, um, what is it called? The way. So it's not exactly an island, like it does attach to the land. What does that call to peninsula? Yeah. Yeah. So, but they have an ability at both the peninsula edge and the bridge to shut it down as a community. If Shit's going down on the island and they don't want someone to get off.

Speaker 2:          03:47          Wow. Yeah. That's how rich they are. Yeah. It's only one of the wealthiest places in the world. And another one, there's a one off side off of Miami. There's like some little tiny island that's filled only with rich people star, I think so. It was called. Yeah. It's like one of the most wealthy places on the planet. It's one little spot off Miami just filled with rich folks waiting for a hurricane to fuck up though. Is that it? Star island is a tiny neighborhood of massive houses and drama. Oh, there's drama. Oh, see the big x on it. Like fuck this place. Okay. It's not a drama. Damn bad ass houses though. But they have good brunch to, yeah, that's a little too, so they have a little bridge and it's a little tiny island. All right. Good luck people. Weird people are weird cat.

Speaker 2:          04:34          That's not safe. Nothing feels safe. Not in Miami. Pirate. A pirate. Come wipe. That whole thing that owls, the place is filled with pirates that places filled with weird shit. It's just Florida is so straight. I love it. I'm joking around, but I hate it. But I love Miami. I just, it's so strange. It's such a, every time I go down there, I'm like, you should have to have a passport to come here. This is not America. I don't give a fuck what anybody says. It's great, but it's, it's chaos. But then there's some Florida spots like we like, okay, Pensacola, you just go fuck yourself. Would you say it's basically Alabama as wealthy? It might as well we, other than Roy Jones Jr, I mean, he came out of there. You put pence coal on the map.
