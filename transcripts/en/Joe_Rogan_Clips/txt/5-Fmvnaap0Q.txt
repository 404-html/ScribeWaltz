Speaker 1:          00:00          I get a lot of letters from people asking me, well, you know, I'm facing a similar situation. What should I do? Uh, professors out? And my answer is fight back hard. So I've had a couple of these situations. I had a guy on Twitter, the guy, the guy who money referred to as a retired, started, started contacting my university, trying to get me fired when he, when it wasn't working with his tagging my university on Twitter. He actually contacted the HR department, Human Resources Department at my university. This is a random person. What's a troll? You got in touch with a troll and you gave him what he wanted attention and then he just started to run with it. You basically gave him an opportunity to score. He's playing a video game. Exactly. But now here's what happened. The university's HR person contacts me after hours. I mentioned this actually recently on the Ruben report.

Speaker 1:          00:50          The, the, the, the lady in question contacts me to say, look, here's a complaint that's been filed against you. Now, my first react instinct was, oh, someone in my job as a professor at the university has complained about me, which I couldn't think who that would be, but I would think that that's where the, the, the template of their influence over me would reside. No, they had actually taken seriously a random person on Twitter contacting them and filing a complaint under the guise of he's a student. Well, he's not my student. Right? I mean, if a student, uh, costs me in an alley to Mug me, I can't fight back because Bruh, he's a student or I'm allowed to, to deck him. Right? So this is a guy that I'm just having fun with. I mean, I'm doing it with a smile. We're going back and forth the size that he's willing to go as far as try to get me fine.

Speaker 1:          01:41          Now let's suppose that he had succeeded, let's suppose that I hadn't fought back because basically what I did with the university, I said, are you literally thinking that it is reasonable for you to be monitoring what I do on my Twitter account? And the example I gave her as an analogy, I said, if if I see you coming out of the pharmacy with your daughter and I feel that you're speaking to her and occur manner that I don't agree with as a parent, can I report you to the university? And that pretty much ended the conversation very quickly. But the fact that they felt sufficiently in bolden to actually reach out to me to address this complaint shows you how chilling the environment is. It is. Right, but let's play devil's advocate. Sure. If I was someone who was taking your class or if I was someone who is very sensitive or someone who has certain ideals or morals and the professor who's teaching the class that I take called somebody a retard, I would, I mean just being honest and I love you, I would, I would say, why is this guy doing that?

Speaker 1:          02:47          Like that's a stupid thing to do. Like why are you engaging with these people online and these, these base insults like that distasteful insults. Fair enough. And I engage with people like that. I mean literally the reason I do it as once in a while, my wife falls asleep. I don't feel like working on my scientific papers or my book or whatever. I'm tired and I'm on Twitter and I heeded your advice to try to not engage with people. Some idiots catches my eye. Oh Gee, I use the word idiot idiot for some strange reason. Okay. It ain't call more on his own. Okay. You just can't call them. So someone, someone, our word catches my attention and I decided to spar with them. You, you, you like to get into the octagon and do MMA sparring. I go on Twitter and I have fun with some idiot, but when I just enjoy it and usually we both laugh it off and we move on.

Speaker 1:          03:37          It's just part of my personality, right? I'm, I'm, I'm a fun guy. I could be deadly serious and very academic and scientific. And as you've correctly pointed in the past, I could not take myself seriously. It'd be just one of the guys. So this is a manifestation of that now that this person felt sufficiently in bolden and his indignation that he would try to fire me. That's where you should be focusing on sort of. I don't think that's real. I don't think he really felt so emboldened. I think what it was is he recognized that there is a climate today where a person like yourself, who is a professor who uses a certain word that is deemed to be offensive by society, that he can call you on that word and get you caught. You got caught up in a net of your own doing, sir.

Speaker 1:          04:21          Well, I'm, I'm, I'm still here smiling and looking fans, so that's okay. Do you do look 10 d, do you regret using that word at more than anything? I regret that I ever get sucked into these battles. That's, that's it as much because again, it's a slippery slope today. It's retarded. Tomorrow it's more on the next day it's schmuck. Yeah. Well that is true in terms of like were people don't understand calling someone to retard, like say if you're a 30 year old person today or 25 year old person, let's try 25. Um, you realize that that is forbidden. Taboo war when you and I were 25, that word was nothing, right. That word you would, you'd get taught called it by your teacher. Right? I mean, it's true. That was, and it, and it was known to be someone who was retarding you or growth or retarding the class or saying things that were retarding development of ideas and, and logic moving forward that you're, you're, you're a roadblock.

Speaker 1:          05:24          You're a pile of rocks in the road. Right. You fucking retard. Like that's how people talked about it. Like that's how they said it, but then it's become a new word that's victim to this war on words. Because you're not saying you have down syndrome. Right. What you're saying is you're a dumb person, you know, and that terminology, like, especially the word retarded, it is not even used medically. Right. So it's, it's not a word and the to say that there's no nuance in this word cannot be used again about a really stupid fucking person, right.
