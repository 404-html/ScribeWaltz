Speaker 1:          00:00          What was that shit that we drank with Stan? Hope that was really good. Was it Stan Hope? No, Stan hope wrong. Dan Home brought it and it doesn't some band make it. That's the Florida Georgia line or some shit. Cause do they make it? Is it theirs? Yeah, it's like a pop band and they make a good whiskey like a country band. I think country pop and whatever. Old Camp. Listen man, if you call yourself country but you get them fake rips and Eugene's, you can go suck a bag of death. Okay, that ain't country. Not saying that they have that. I don't even know. But you know what I'm saying? Like those fake rips in the gene drive might have a couple of little faith groups in my team do. I checked those fake grips drive me God damn banana. I was like, what are we, we're pretending that we work hard or what are we pretending that we, we've had these jeans for a long time and they're special to us or do we just buy them off the shelf at Macy's pre ripped like assholes.

Speaker 1:          00:58          Where the fuck did that take place? Like if our grandparents who made it through the depression could come over here and see us buying ripped jeans would they would realize like what is wrong with this nerved up soften down fucking shitty country. We live in America. It's too easy, too easy to get by wolves in the streets. Young Eric can't be running around with fucking fake rips in your genes. I mean, I'm Brendan Schaub. One of my best friends does that. Oh, who's this? That's them. That's them with the five. Nailed it. I didn't even mean to nail it. I didn't even mean that. I just took a wild guess. I don't know a goddamn thing about these fellows. Go to that other one. Go to that last picture, right. We put the glasses on and look at, look at those genes. Make that bigger. Well he looks like he got a shark.

Speaker 1:          01:50          I got some paint. Oh, you do have some gray. Got Some fucked up shit on your jeans. I'm gonna. I'm gonna keep it real though. I'm not going to like, this is sad. Let you go in on them and not come claim my jeans here. Listen, I should shut the fuck up. I'm basically wearing yoga pants. I got these barbell jeans on. These aren't even jeans. These are goddamn yoga pants, jeans, or made a weird like this thing. I mean, well these don't, these aren't even Jesus. These are like, they might as well be spend decks. I might as well be wearing yoga pants most most pants or that now. Even the ones that looked like jeans, a lot of them are that they feel better technology. It's called advancement in human civilization. Yeah. You want to drive a car with leaf springs like an asshole or do you want some new magnetic Cadillac Escalade, you know, cruise through your pants or you want to be sweaty all like the breeze from the fake holes. I'll take the sweat like a man.
