Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah. Wow. So, I mean, listen, there are people, uh, you know, at 10 years on the show, I was on the show for a long time. There's people lot longer. It's people that did the whole 17 years. People have done well over a hundred, you know, no one left that show. You don't leave that show if you get a spot on it.

Speaker 2:          00:17          Were you with him when, when it ended?

Speaker 1:          00:21          No. Uh, no. I was with him, um, about a week and a half before. Uh, so now, uh, good friends that were there.

Speaker 2:          00:31          I was in, um, Chicago and uh, I've woke up and the check my phone and I got a text from my friend Maynard Maynard Keenan from tool and um, Maynard is a Jujitsu brown belt and really loves Jujitsu. Any, any, um, the text me, he said so much for the, uh, Maynard versus Anthony Bordain celebrity Jujitsu match and that's the whole text. And um, you know, just sunk, sunk a pit in my stomach and I just, I just picked up my phone and went into Google and I looked it up and I saw it. I'm just like, oh fuck. I just couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe it.

Speaker 3:          01:27          Now I just started crying.

Speaker 2:          01:36          I think. I think I called my wife had called Maynard or texted him. I called my wife, called a few friends,

Speaker 3:          01:44          you know, just like,

Speaker 2:          01:49          you know, just couldn't believe, you know, when someone's just not there anymore. I didn't get to see him a lot, but I was just, uh, just appreciate the fuck out of that dude. You know, like, I don't want to do anybody's TV show, but when I got a call from him, I was like, fuck yeah, what are we gonna do? We're gonna shoot pheasants and hunt and camp and we're going to cook by the campfire. Fuck, I'm in, dude. You know, I'm in. I just really, uh, appreciated him as a, a genuine, unique person. Like is a genuine, rare person. And uh, you know, that's, that's what I got out of being, being able to spend some time with him and being able to talk to him and pick his brain. And he did my podcast once and we always planned on doing it again. We should, we never got around to it because we're both have ridiculous schedules, but just my, I would think about things differently because of him. Like got my, I would sometimes like hold things to his standards and e j like legitimately his appreciation for things, his enthusiasm for things changed the way I look at a lot of, a lot of aspects of food and culture and, and, and even travel, you know?

Speaker 1:          03:09          Yeah. I mean, um,

Speaker 3:          03:12          yeah,

Speaker 1:          03:13          I'm sorry ma'am. And I, you know, I, and I know he thought very highly of you, and that was, that experience in Montana was fantastic, man. So fun. Um, you know, it's been, it's been a rough three months and it's still hard for me to really contextualize it and put it together. It feels like, you know, upside down world. Like there's no, and he was such a, I mean, it was a friend and a collaborator, you know, but also just such an icon to me, you know?

Speaker 3:          03:48          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:49          And, uh, did, it's almost like, you know, it's almost like the sun disappears, you know, or something. It's something that is so just inherently part of life. They're in and dependable and you know, um,

Speaker 3:          04:04          yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:05          So yeah, I mean it's been all right. It's hard to describe how, how um, profound that's been. Um,

Speaker 3:          04:13          okay.

Speaker 2:          04:13          I remember when he got into Jiu Jitsu, I got site cause I'm like, we got more to talk about now. I can actually, I can actually show him some shit. And he was always asking about things, you know, he's really good at things. Remember when we were in Montana, we were rolling around on the dirt. I know shown her stuff, him and Josh, I was like click when you're in here, like here's what you can do, you can get the end. He's like, Oh yeah. He's like, he was so a wide eyed, you know, I think it was before he even got his blue belt or maybe it was like around blue belt. So he was super, super jacked about it and he was doing it every day. I remember when we were, we were filming, we were outside of billings. Is that where we were? Where were we? Yeah, well we're, the hunt was on the hunt. We were in

Speaker 1:          04:55          like a up in central Montana, you know, so, um, we kind of started in billings, but we headed up towards central Montana.

Speaker 2:          05:02          He was training so often in, even on the road that he traveled to a club, there was just a Jujitsu club in Bozeman. Yeah. And he found some guys. And who's wrong with these guys in Bozeman? Yeah, yeah, definitely. Like damn you doing it every day. So that was a day for a long time on the show. That was a mandate. We find the local, you know, the local clubs and make sure that he had a place to role texted me from some European bloc country. Said he was shitting bone bone chips as a, he worked out with some old school Carlson Gracie guys. They don't believe in rolling light. It's all top game and smashing you. And he said, yeah, I'm shitting bone chips. But I just, I admired that a guy could be 58 years old and decide I'm going to learn Jujitsu and I'm going to be obsessed with it. And then he became addicted to it, which, you know, Jujitsu is a very beneficial thing to be addicted to, but it is absolutely an addiction. I've, I've come back from injuries where I definitely shouldn't have been yet and

Speaker 1:          05:58          are just wrapped my arm up and just fucking get in there. People get super, super addicted to it and he got addicted to it just like he's been addicted to many things. He just, he jumped right into the Jujitsu experience. Um, well I'm glad he did. It wasn't me anyway. It was clearly like really good for him to us. I mean, I know very little about your jet, so I know what I know from Tony, you know, little slim. Yeah. He lost all that weight. All of sudden the out of stocks packs up smoking. Yeah. You know, those were, those were big things, man. And uh, and he looked great and he's, you know, he got off statens. It's no longer on any sort of medication. He lost all that weight, caught all the carbs out. It was just eating like, you know, just protein crazy man.

Speaker 1:          06:44          It looks so good. He did look good. Um, he did look good. Then I also just, I, you know, the whole thing was kind of indicative of the way he was. I mean, he did things so passionately, you know, whether it was travel the world and soaking up all these experiences or Jujitsu or whatever, if he was into something, if something caught his attention, he was just so aggressive about knowledge, learning what he could, pulling everything out of it that, that he could, you know, it's crazy to see someone do something that's that physically demanding. Yeah, no kidding. 58 with no background in athletics of the law. Yeah. Like you could see when he was like, even when he was doing things, like when he went to curt, Osi Anders place and was rolling around like he doesn't have a background in now, but he's just pushing himself to it.

Speaker 1:          07:30          Yeah. Yeah. And again, I think that was true with everything, you know? I mean, if he, if it was something that was interesting to him, he just went, he loved it, man. It was crazy. And I said, you know, I remember texting him going like, how deep you getting into it? He goes, real fucking deep. And he goes, but he goes, he goes, I'm getting tapped out every day. But he goes, I'm giving guys half my age of real struggle. And he goes, uh, and I'm loving it. Yeah. And he talked about that a lot. I mean, I think he talked about like the, the failure as much as anything else. I'd love that. Yeah. Going in and, you know, getting smashed. Yeah. But you know, again, to his credit, you know, which show up in these places, you know, Bozeman, Montana man or, or Butte, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          08:16          I think he rolled in Butte know a hard hitting town. Man, listen, I love beauty. I love you too much respect to anyone from Butte. But man, that's a hard hit in town. You know, you can roll into real cowboys, you know, and uh, and get the shit kicked out of him and show up on set all, you know, sore, bruised and, oh man. Oh yeah. And then just jump into that. You know, it's different for a guy who's 58. I mean you got a guy who does it at 20. I admire anybody who does Jujitsu cause it's a real humbling ego dissolving experience and a lot of ways cause she's makes you realize like all your illusions of how well you can defend yourself. They go out the window and some just chokes you easily and you're like, oh great, I'm just a bitch.

Speaker 1:          08:58          Wanted around running around this life thinking I'm a man. But the fact that he did it at 58 just showed what kind of a unusual duty was. Yeah. But would you just talked about there? I mean, what you're talking about with like the ego diminishing aspect of it. Again, I think that that was something that he took great pleasure in. And I think that, you know, if you look at the way he went through the world, um, one of the things that, you know, I appreciated right off the bat and one of the things that kept me around as long as I stayed around, you know, um, cause the fact that it took, you know, for Tony, I think that he was constantly trying to dismantle that persona. You know, to say like, I'm, I'm not the focal point of this scene. The what we're interested in here, what I'm interested in talking about is out there.

Speaker 1:          09:48          That's the camera's pointed away from me. You know, he was kind of a clearing house for all that information and he was the root of the show and it was his journey. But you know, ultimately, you know, what was refreshing as he wasn't like working with some celebrity or hosts that was completely consumed by their own ego and their own, you know, brand and, and how they were presented to the world. That's so disgusting right now. Yeah. Tears. But it's, it's everywhere. It's everywhere. Yeah. He was very self deprecating and he had reverence for real artists and real masters and total reverence. Yeah. Came across. It came across, I texted him about some guy, there was a photo of a restaurant and uh, I'm sure it's still on my phone. Some dude who's like a real famous guy who's like some big time chef character and I was eating in this restaurant.

Speaker 1:          10:42          And so I'm like, who the fuck is this guy? I guess it seems like it's a big deal. And so, uh, I, uh, I texted him the photo, this cat right here. Yeah. Do you know that guys? Was that guy's name? So I said, who is that guy? Says Marco Pierre White Made Ramsey cry like a bitch all the time. Original rock star, chef genius, mad man, the original punk. But that kind of texts, like that's, that's a Tony Board game text. Um, that's, that's what that, that text shows that reverence for the master. Oh yeah. You know, I mean, even the way he phrases it, you know, made him cry like a bitch all time. Original rock star, chef Genius Madman, you know. And, um, and that's the way, I mean, what was, what worked about that is he had a, like an instant ability to sniff through the bullshit, you know, so, you know, there's, listen, there's all kinds of famous people, celebrities and you know, well accomplished people that he met that he didn't feel that way. You know, he would cut through that shit instantly, but if you were on his radar in that way, you know, it's like total commitment to what you do and you were in

Speaker 2:          11:54          or you're out the Anthony Bordain click. Exactly. Dude. You want to be in that list of people is like, yeah, that's a cool list to be on. Well I just remember hanging out with them, you know, like I just, it was one of those guys, he was one of the ones that I met that I was like pretty starstruck. Like right away I said something really stupid. Like my wife says, you're my boyfriend. Cause they've watched his show all the time. She would just joke around how you want your boyfriend on TV? Like, he's great guys, great, leave him alone. But, um, like, uh, when we were in Montana, that's when I really, well, I always knew how hard he went, but when I was blasted out of my mind and he was like, where's that bottle? Where's those joints? And I was like, Jesus, man.

Speaker 2:          12:37          Like, I can't even know I'm hanging onto the earth here. Well, I was a late night. Yeah, it was that one. I mean, I'll listen to their, like in all fairness, not every night was quite like that without, we had a lot of fun that night for sure. It was real fun and in a really interesting, thoughtful dialogue around the campfire with super land townie from backwoods country hunters and anglers and all this, the other guys that were with us, right, you, these guys who, it was good to get a different perspective on what going out and getting your own wild food is like, yeah. You know, and then having him cook it there and it was delicious. It was awesome. And, but also being able to put those ideas on like a major network and print, pretty rare. Man.
