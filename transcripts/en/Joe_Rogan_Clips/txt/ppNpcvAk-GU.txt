Speaker 1:          00:00          I thought if he thought the way he always fights that would be a car Raisie fight. But he was so nervous from that fight from the steep bay fight that he just did terrible. He just couldn't pull the trigger. They're frozen of hurt back. So you've got a complete shit show out of two knockout artists. I just think that um, that uh, you know, has been out for a long time. He's a motherfucker though. He's the best. I think he the best. I think he's the best in terms of like physical ability. You think he's the best heavyweight of all time? I think he's the best. I think he has to do, I used to do a little more work. Think he's the best in terms of what he's accomplished. I think fate or is the best heavyweight of all time in terms of what he's accomplished.

Speaker 1:          00:41          Maybe maybe you can make the argument for, for BC over doom because we're doing beat him, but I think for doing beat a fade or that had already been through the ringer and pride and all the chaos over there. I mean he had been in those wars with fucking cro cop, but for doing beat him when it was still the ORIF fade or he was the first one where, where you realized she was shooting of, cause Brett Rogers kind of took a little bit out of that. Did he starched fucking payout them but before that he had trouble with them. It was a, it wasn't an easy fight. It wasn't an easy fight. It was me. Respect Brat. Right. He did have a cro cop like, I mean you'll curl hop fucking punch and leaped and Oh fucking God. You know with that right hand and right hand was redonkulous though I it's, it's, it's tough to say greatest of all time because it's the greatest of that time period because when, when he was doing it, there were specialists that he was great.

Speaker 1:          01:31          There were certain things that made him great. He was under size because if you put his skill set with his frame now into the, the, the pool, it's, I don't know if he's the best, but then Cain at his time when there's jds and he's in his prime Brock Lesnar and he's beating those guys, what cane would do to people, he would overwhelm you in a way that looked like you were drowning. His Cardio and pace was insane. Insane. Like did you, did junior dos Santos fights I think took so much out of junior, both of them. I think it took it, both of them paid the price. Yeah. It was the same thing as a, I was listened to. Um, who's the box you just had on from a love Kelly Pavlik how you were saying he doesn't watch the rematch with Canelo triple g cause it takes so much out of those guys that they're never the same.

Speaker 1:          02:14          I'm using, I'm usually on the same thinking path. Is that where I'm like, God, if those guys go out again, man, we're never going to get a good product. But Cain, Cain and junior for sure. I mean, especially the third fight and the third fight was second one to the second one to pop both of them. They just then jds a steep bay. Yeah, that was, that was quite steep. And jds has had some Warthen steep. It has had some wars and you can, you can tell that they're there. They're just different in life. I'm not saying it's brain train, whatever it is, but it's just, they're just different. They're not, they leave a piece of themselves in that, in that octagon. Well it's for sure some brain trauma. Yeah. I'm just trying to be nice to try and be nice and getting hit in the head that much. Like they, they, they leave, they leave a little piece of mint in there for our entertainment. And I feel a little guilty about what's crazy. This was no talk about Steve Bay. Steve paid the most accomplished heavyweight of all time. He's the greatest in terms of like his accomplishments. He defended the title more than anybody. He didn't fight the best guys in their prime when he fought junior and junior was definitely past his prime knock on him. Right.

Speaker 1:          03:18          But again, when, when it was his run during his era, Steve Bay's the best when it was Kane during his era, he was the best fade or was the best. It's hard to say this has been in this guy because it's just a different time period. Right. Jordan better than Lebron Jordan during that era. By far the best, the Brown right now, by far the best. It's stupid. We don't know. I don't know. You know, so that's, that's the question about steep pace. Like why, why is there no talk about him fighting again? Like why have they not said something he's trying, he's trying. Like he even tweeted that he goes DC before your retire. Let's do it, man. Yeah. Like quit waiting for John. Let's do it. Well, he's being really active on social media trying to, but it doesn't seem like there's a lot cause he has to be, because you know why it's not in his nature.

Speaker 1:          04:02          We know that's not steepened. We know that. That's not Steve. He's a firefighter. Humble, blue collar dude. He's going to put in work. Comes to fight all the time. So Derrick Lewis explains turning down Steve Bay fight. Derrick says they wanted me to fight steep at short notice. I wanted some time off. I would still fight steep pay, but not right now. Not so soon. Especially after you're fighting a guy like DC who's more of a wrestler thing, going to fight steep pay. I know I wanted some time off. So they tried getting steep a fight, so they were trying to get them for the UFC. He's a Brooklyn car this weekend. Nuts. Uh, was that this weekend, but it's smart of Derek Lewis. They see when you go DC then Steve Bay, there couldn't be two worst match ups for him. He's going to get paid to beatings. You're going to take, but you know, it's likely unless he connects. Yeah.
