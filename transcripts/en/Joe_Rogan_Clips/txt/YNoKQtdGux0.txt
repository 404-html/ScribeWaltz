He's not a tennis player, but Mike was a wild boy and to hang out with him, you could understand like he was the biggest person on the planet and he had the demons. You know what I'm saying?

I said, well, anybody come to my house? They got to perform. So I said, Yo man, they say, you know, you rappers it, he wrapped the most incredible free. I don't know if it was free, it wasn't current. I said, I don't know why you aren't famous. He did it with a broken jaw. He had a little bro, little jobs, a little swollen. I don't think it was broken, but it was a little swollen cause it wasn't too long after that accident that he had. Right. And then he goes, ah, I, I got a Song Dad, dad, you or you'll be cut on.
