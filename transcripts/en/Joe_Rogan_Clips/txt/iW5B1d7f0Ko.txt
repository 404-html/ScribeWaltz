Speaker 1:          00:00          These are people who see themselves as gods who want to be a world historical figures there. They're literally do that. Who, who do you think is doing that well? Like, like Jeff Bezos. You think he thinks of himself as a god? Yeah. Really? Yeah. Really you don't, and now I read those text messages he sent to that check. I don't think God would say that God would say you should be lucky to get this dick on this space exploration stuff though. It's like, you know all that people are obsessed with the life extinction extinction. Um, but, but don't you think that this is a side effect of having $150 billion? You so much good with that. So bayzos is pouring $1 billion a year into his, into his space exploration project, which is like, I mean, I'm excited by space too. I think it'd be cool to go up there, but there's some pressing problems here, which we could really benefit.

Speaker 1:          00:48          You know, that money could really benefit and I agree. But Longterm, I think the philosophy is that we're going to have to get off this planet. If the human race is going to succeed, but because of not just the threat of global warming but of Astra steroid packs, it's an asteroid thing I think. I mean for me Novas there's a lot of factors mark on the particular question of climate. Um, there's just no way that the earth is going to get as inhospitable as Mars is. So the idea of building a colony there as a hedge against global warming, it's just crazy. We could, it is ridiculous on the positive note, if we could fix that shit hole, like imagine what we could do here. Yeah. Paradise. Yeah. Well the idea is terraforming, right? That they can go there with some kind of massive machine that's gonna create oxygen and the environment and yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:36          Well that's a good place to practice because no one lives there. So you could do all kinds of goofy shit and go, well, good news and bad news. The good news is we figured out a way, terraform, the bad news is we already fucked up Mars, so we're going to try another spot. We're going to go to, you know, we're going to move on to see rhinos. Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, Venus used to be actually quite earthlike. Yeah. And they went through a really rapid global warming that made it, now it's like a total hellhole and that's like the sort of worst case. Worst case for earth is the venous scenario. Well, ultimately the sun's going to burn out, right. But that's many millions of years for sure. But if we really do look into the future, something, something has to be done. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          02:12          This is the, on the grandest of grand scales, the, the concept of a, some sort of interstellar arcs. I mean, I believe that I'm, and I'm, I'm, I'm with it. I just think the timescale of the threat that we're, that we need to avert by space exploration. That's a timescale of Millennia. Yes. We have a lot of new technology develop over the next thousand years that will allow us to do it better and more efficiently. But climate change, the timescale is like the next 30 years. Right? So we need to focus on it now. To give ourselves the opportunity to do the other show. Why do you think it's sexier to go to space? Is that what it is? Like rockets and I mean, I think for these dudes. Yeah, yeah. It's a big metal dick. You shooting off into the atmosphere. That's what we're doing and kind of fuck space.

Speaker 1:          02:54          I actually made that argument about Mars. Yeah. It's like they're shaped like dicks. Yeah. Something to that. Yeah. Well also this generation of people really grew up in the, in the age of like the space race. I mean it's um, and the aftermath of landing on the moon and I think there is, like Peter Teal talks about this, there's this kind of unfulfilled sense of future that we all, like anybody who grew up in the post war years in the 67 they were like, you know, whatever his famous line were promised flying cars and all we got was 140 characters or whatever. I think that that applies to the space exploration stuff. It's like, well, the government is no longer doing the really ambitious shit, but we can do it privately. On the other hand, there is a government in the world that is doing that shit. And China, they just landed on the far side of the moon.

Speaker 1:          03:41          They're doing really aggressive space exploration and I haven't been there in 20 years, but the people I know who live there say there was so much faith in the future there. Um, they just believe in a very inherent, deep down way that like the future will be better and Psi Phi e in an exciting way. And that's so far from the way that Americans think about the future. Is that part of the benefit of having a dictator run things? I think it's just like they're on a huge upswing and so like there's no debate about how things get done. Yeah, yeah, totally. I mean that's what I was saying before. It's like it, it gives you some hope for climate. If like Xi Jinping is just like, okay, immediately, no more coal, they'll all stop. But he's also throwing 2 million Muslims in concentration camps. Yeah. Um, this bayzos thing, I mean, I'm not criticizing you because I think it's a very common thought, but why is it that we look at these super rich billion billionaire characters that are on the top of the heap?

Speaker 1:          04:37          Why do we think of them as like having these tremendous egos and looking like gods isn't it sort of just does just how you're always going to look at someone who lives in of $100 million house and it's possible. I think when you look at, I mean not to get too like armchair psychologizing about basis, but when you look at the physical transformation that he's put himself through, when you think about like the life extinction, what has he done physically? But he's just like, I mean if, if you look at photos of him when he's like a young man, he's, you know, just kind of like dweeby right? And now he's like a, um, an action hero. This is, he really, yeah. I mean maybe not like you, but he's like, he's, yeah, he's pretty as big as Jack. Am I missing something? Let me show you. Definitely looks different. Go pull up, pull ups and marriages of Jeff Bezos jacked. I didn't know, but he got a trainer. I mean, no, I'm not blaming him, but that's only one part of it. I would say I'm bigger than that is, you know, the, I had just had thin skins. I'm the worlds. Okay. Let me say zoom in.

Speaker 1:          05:39          I guess he's got some arms there is. Oh Wow. That's a big difference. Yeah. But he's also got a vest on. I guess his arms do look pretty big. Yeah. I mean in most ways I'm not a business hater. I think Amazon has been actually really pretty great. I'm a fan. Yeah. I like, well listen to the guy talk and I loved his letter to the national enquirer. There he is right there. Yeah. So he looks fit in front of the King Kong rampage movie. Is that him? Yeah. Yeah, he looks pretty good. Um, okay. I guess physical transformation, but that's, yeah. Probably life extinction, like uploading your brain to the computer. There's so many busy into that shit. I, he is actually, I think not as into it to some other people.
