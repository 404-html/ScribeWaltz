Speaker 1:          00:00          Her low freak bitches. Is He, what is he like when the lights are off? I wish I could have a fucking a feed of Trump's brain when the lights go down, that's probably CIOs. What is he thinking? Is he like, I'm killing it or is he like, what have I done? I think there's gotta be both. Yeah. Or there he's gotta be, uh, well he doesn't drink and he doesn't do drugs. Right. And I think there's gotta be a part of his brain that's pushing down the, what have I done and it reinforcing, doubling down on the, I'm the greatest. I'm the best. I mean, that's why I kept saying about his inauguration numbers. There's so many people were there. And even when they told him that it wasn't the case, he fought it. Then when he kept parroting, not just parenting to friends, but doing it to the news, doing it to the press, that he got the largest number of electoral college votes.

Speaker 1:          00:49          That's crazy. It's psychedelic narcissism. It's like, it's so far out there. It starts to seem like, Whoa, you're bending reality and actually is bending reality. He's done. He's done a fascinating job of just making people not know what's real anymore and no one knows what's real anymore and Syria as the ultimate example because it's unclear what Israel, they're like, no one knows what the right thing to do is. Who are we attacking and why? What are we trying to stop? You sent bombs to the people that are fighting isis to fight those people from doing chemical warfare on their own people, but then we also are fighting isis with them and then it's just the whole thing. You're just like, I give up. You will have, when Ron Paul was saying that the chemical attack doesn't make sense, so certain Soton Republicans are actually looking at me as Ron Paul Tech and the Republicans more libertarian than anything, but they're looking at it and saying like this, this might not even been real.

Speaker 1:          01:43          I mean, I just, well, I heard this great thing about how no one in Israel believes that Rabin was killed by Yigal Amir, the Jewish guy like that. They, they believe in that. Basically hearing a conspiracy theory that widely believed in a country that isn't my own made me realize how wildly desperate for conspiracy theory everyone is. Right? It like somehow the distance where it was like, oh it's Israel. It's not really me. Made me go like, oh this is so interesting. Like everybody wants to believe it wasn't one hour until they were saying that the chemical attack by Assad was not real. Even though Assad has done gas based chemical tests on his own people before and his father did before him. Somehow this one was like, no, no, this is fake. It might be fake. That's what's so crazy and mind bending. It might be fake.

Speaker 1:          02:29          And yet I don't buy any conspiracy theories anymore cause I knew how desperate people are to believe them. Well this was the same scenario that led Obama to make that speech saying that we need to go into Syria and the whole American people went fuck that. Cause we were deep in the Iraq war, deepen the Afghanistan war and that was when this, I think that was 2013 or 14 but Trump made quotes. It's crazy that he tweeted like, what does a u s have to gain for going into Syria? We should be America first and then winds up acting almost instantaneously. Yeah, I know. It happens. People keep dropping these, like you said, this, yeah. Bombs at Trump's feet. Like he cares about intellectual coherence or hypocrisy. He doesn't care. He's a fucking rat trapped. He's trapped in a corner of amaze and he's going like, what the fuck do I do?

Speaker 1:          03:18          Oh, I'll just do this. It's so, it's so transparent. Like 35% approval rating. Everything is, you're, you're collapsing under your own weight. You have the house and the Senate and you can't get anything done. No one likes you. You're the worst. So what do you do? You fucking make something explode. It's just such a terrible recipe of something actually goes wrong. Oh yeah. Like Syria is a minor issue. No one died. Totally bomb. Some airfields, they ruined some, you know, some ground, I agree. Ruin some air ships. Um, some, uh, planes. But what happens if something really goes down and that guy is, that is the figurehead. That is the difference between the Roman Empire and this empire is that the Roman Empire didn't have the power to press a button and destroy, like path the countries on earth. And we do. So that's the scary part. Oh, come to the comedy store. The Saturday night.

Speaker 2:          04:23          Yeah.
