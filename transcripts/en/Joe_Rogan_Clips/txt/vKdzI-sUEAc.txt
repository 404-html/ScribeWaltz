Speaker 1:          00:00          It's just like, like, uh, by publicly saying this, you can speak to your respective group and you have an immediate reward for it. So it's like, you know, it's like, I don't even know if we're more sensitive. We're just more outspoken about, you know, things well because we have an athletic more outraged. They're looking to get outraged. That's, that's a really common thing now that just didn't exist a few days. I don't even think it's a, I don't even think it's outrage, you know what I mean? Like I really don't think it's outrageous. Much as it cause outrage. We've seen what outrage looks like at the, when at the peak of, uh, like the black lives matter movement where people at a course by people outrage. Yeah. But that's in the streets. But that's what I'm saying. But that's what, that's what outrage is. And I don't want to confuse that with like, you know, recreational outrage.

Speaker 1:          00:56          Right. And it's really important to draw that distinction. Right. And so it's like, it, it's, again, people are vocal about things, some issues, real, a lot of things we started getting upset about there. Like certain, we get upset about certain cultural appropriation things of the week because it's a Sushi restaurant on a college campus. Right. You know what I mean? Like we, we get caught up in those things but [inaudible] and not focus on, you know, like I dunno, it's like real outrageous. The thing that corporations or afraid of isn't outrage. It's trending. You don't want to trend negatively for like whatever period of time when when people are upset with you and you've done something genuinely wrong, they'll show it beyond. It will extend the scent that if it makes sense. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:46          Yeah. I think that a lot of what outrageous is like comedian trying out chokes. You know, you try out jokes and 30% of them are just straight bullshit fucking work man. You try him, they stumble out, you gave it a shot or you'll ad Lib something in the moment on stage and even after you say like, what the fuck did I just say? Yeah. I think there's some of that that people are trying to, like I was reading this article the other day about some woman who was saying that yoga is supporting white supremacy because it was the dumbest shit ever. Some Indian lady, she was seeing the cultural appropriation of yoga by white people is supporting white supremacy and you know, it's really fun. What are we doing exactly what the fuck are we doing? But that's what she did is she tried a bad joke.

Speaker 2:          02:33          You know she's a, she works on, she's a professor and some bullshit college where they're just just drowning in liberal arts and she just figured out a way to say something outrageous that she thought made sense in her own weird bubble. But this got published in a newspaper and then the whole world went just collectively. What the fuck are you talking about? But that's what it's like. It's like you are, I try and a bit late night at the store you do, you just just riff something and it just goes into a corner and just get stuck. Roomba vacuum cleaner things is bouncing off the white like this is not working. I got to bail out of this. Yeah, yeah. No, it's funny because it is like people people's age. It's a creative force. She's like, she tried to make outrage where it didn't exist and sometimes it catches right like hoop earrings.

Speaker 2:          03:32          Like girls can't wear hoop earrings anymore. Wait, wait. Girls are scared to wear hooping hearings because they're getting called out for cultural appropriation by which is hilarious by Latina chicks. This is particularly Latino chicks are saying and it's just all social justice warrior bullshit. But what's really funny is so I had, cause I'm an asshole, I had to Google it. Well who the fuck invented earrings? The Sumerians, the, the oldest version of hoop earrings is for 2,500 BC from Iraq. So Iraqi's are the only ones who really can claim cultural appropriation. People wearing hoop earrings, not Mexicans. So Mexicans settled down. He does white girls alone cause you stole a tail that was black girl. Shit. Everybody Shit. It's like who invented pants? Your culture appropriating. You're wearing pants. Who invented pants? You were on a Korean phone bitching about people doing, oh man, talking about man.

Speaker 2:          04:29          And it goes deep. It's crazy. People are losing their mind. They're looking for things to get outraged that and so that they're trying jokes, they're taking swings, you know, that trying on pitches out there, you know, you're spit balling. Well, I mean, and eventually if it's like, if you, you're gonna run out of ways to approach it, you know what I mean? Like you run out, we run a places to, to stab the thing. Well they try some that don't stick or some stick for like a couple of days. Like you remember Bossy, they were trying to say, you can't say bossy. No. Why? Why can't call girls bossy? It's sexist crows, girls bossy. Don't call them bossy. He was a thing where they were trying to stop the use of the word or the phrase bossy. They were saying bossy. Sexist. Yeah. See, but like, like can I ask a question?

Speaker 2:          05:16          Where did, uh, when, when did, uh, when did cunt become a bad word? It depends on who you're in. England, man, they don't give a fuck. Is that [inaudible] got hurt? The herd used until like, I mean, nobody, I didn't grow up around it. I didn't hear people saying this. I don't even think I heard it used until like, I mean, I was probably theme like a Hollywood bad word. Yeah, yeah. No, it's word that when you used it, you fucking really were angry. Yeah. Yeah. It just, I don't know where it came from. It's like the new bitch. It's not new. I mean, it was around a long, it's been around for, so that was in high school, but you called someone a cunt and high school when you were a fighter brother. Oh, shit would get deep. You couldn't say con. You could say, bitch, you're a fucking bitch.

Speaker 2:          06:05          Fuck you. You're a loser. You know, like you're a con. Oh, dude. Well, there'd be like, what the fuck did you just say? That's, yeah, I, I, uh, yeah, I didn't hear it a lot at all. And I could never imagine myself casually called and some yet. But if you lived in England, you could oil, especially living in Australia, they call someone a good con. Hey, he's a good con. Oh, so it's a nice word. Yeah. He's like, he's a, he's a, he's a good dude. He's a good con. Like people have, uh, my friend, uh, Israel at a Sandhya style bender, he wears a shirt that says good con and he just wanders around. It's from New Zealand because they don't want people, they think it's funny when people get upset about it. He's a savage. You better be careful. Get upset with him. But he's a UFC fighter.

Speaker 2:          07:01          Oh, okay. All right. Yeah, he's a, I mean, he's, he's from another country. It means a different thing in New Zealand. If you say con in New Zealand, it's a, it's like, I mean, what's the equivalent? What would be equivalent of con, the way they said, good dude. He's a fuck good fucker. He's a, he's a cool motherfucker. He's a good con. Where you asking because their style, he wears that everywhere. No one says shit. Yeah. Well, yeah, but they sell those shares to look good. I don't know. Why would you ship Hashtag fuck censorship Hashtag make co great again.

Speaker 2:          07:45          Well, I was going to say, is it, is it that, uh, what just like people's reaction to it just kind of bothered me. Yeah. I'm like, I'm like, oh, that's a, it's a terrible battle. Not a terrible bad word like that where it sucks. Like it ain't no motherfucker. You don't like it. Don't think it's fun to say, you know, rhythmically it's just trash. Just like, bye. I was going off of what we were doing interesting shit. Trash. I don't know if you went to Australia though. They, they would say it so many times it would just slip in because this gets normal. Yeah, I guess, yeah, it is just, it's just one syllable. Like it means dude over there sometimes like, and this fucking con, he goes over there and they'll, they'll start talking about it like this fucking dude. They'll still literally say it in the same way you would say this fucking guy. Yeah. It's just a different thing. I mean, look, they're all just sounds that convey expression, the world problems. When you demonize one you say, you know, you can't say the c word anymore. Don't say the c word. Well, yeah, I mean again, it's just like, I just want us to have like adult arguments. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          08:56          right. Well, it's hard to have adult arguments, even forbidden words. Well yeah, we'll book has, that's like the, the shit that your sister got mad at you about growing up. Right. He called me, you know what I mean? Like is kind of like, that's the thing. It's, I mean you were saying intention earlier, but I mean there's always like intentionally, what do you mean by I get an, I get in like these types of my mom, southern Christian women in any curse word that I say any curse word is very, she, she doesn't, she doesn't like it. And I, I her on all the time, I'll always do just because we get into the argument while simultaneously respecting, you know, her views and beliefs. It's also like, you know, these cuss words redid your fucking kitchen lady.

Speaker 1:          09:50          I love her. I love watching her like react to it. Like fun. Yeah. Yeah. Because just like, oh this through the filter of you, like really, you know. See I grew up non suppressed. My parents were hippies and they didn't give a shit where we said we just do, we get, I couldn't really say it at school, but you know, there was no like language restrictions in my house. I'm allowed to say anything. That's great. Yeah, it was weird. That was great. And my friends would come over the house and you just say fucking funny your mom. I'm like, yeah, fuck it. I used to you were I did you grow up around people that like used to just talk shit back to the mall and so like it was never did that. No, it was fun to why I had, I had a friend, my friend Alex is still one of my favorite moments of life.

Speaker 1:          10:39          It was just like we came, I came to this house after school and his mom's name is Patricia and she was just like, I'll take out the garbage. It was like, go to hell pat. His response, cause mom passed. She caught it off. I like, my mind was blown. Told his mom to go to hell. It was like amazing. And she just argued back like it was. Yeah, I was so mama was a dad around. Uh, he knows that, but it wasn't around like, it was always so amazing. It was amazing. That's a struggle that, who's the man? When did you start cussing around your mom? Um, it's been a few hours. No, I probably started, uh, I mean I moved out when I was a teenager, so I, I probably, I mean she's heard me say it to kind of throughout, but just in kind, like not stopping it in conversation.

Speaker 1:          11:34          It's been years. I mean I just, Oh, it's just kind of float. I'm low key, still afraid to cousin from mine.

You're an adult longer than you're a kid, you know, and so it was just like, why am I going to pretend the world sounds different? Look, I, I'm with you. But, and for like his kids are that your brothers, your sisters? My brother, my brother and sister in law. Everybody cool with that or they get upset? Uh, fake. I mean they go like a come sometimes, but it's also they get it.
