Speaker 1:          00:00          You know, so I'm going to, I, I work in a lot of fields, but I would also consider myself an astrobiologist. Right? Which is a pretty kind of wild idea that you can do astrobiology even though you only have one example, which is the earth. But we've learned so much and now we can start asking ourselves about the possibility of life elsewhere. So finding even a microbe like even of Friggin, you know, Amoeba on Mars would be, or even evidence that there used to be me, but it's hard is the evidence that they've discovered on Mars. What they found was, um, organic chemistry, right? And so our but organic chemistry and I hated chemistry when I was growing up. Uh, and I hated our getting again, was that just basically chemistry involved in carbon, you know, so you can have non, or you know, he does organic chemistry doesn't mean organisms, but it's the kind of chemistry that organisms live.

Speaker 1:          00:42          Right? So finding evidence that there was like they drilled and they said like, we send a freaking robot to Mars, they could drill through a rock, you know, and then in just the rocket and then send the data back, cross space, you know, pretty good for a bunch of hairless apes. Yeah. Um, so what, what they found was evidence for fairly complex, um, uh, you know, uh, organic chemistry, which meant that way back when Mars and this, we know for sure, right? Mars had water on it. We know that for sure. Now Morris, it was a blue planet for at least Mars was hit by an asteroid or a common or something along those lines. Everything got hit by comments. That's how we have, you know, we have chunks of Mars here, right? That, you know, the thing in [inaudible] 96 or whatever, when they were like, oh, we found life on Mars.

Speaker 1:          01:23          You know, they thought that what they found was a fossil bacteria in a chunk of our Mars that they found in an article. So the planets had been swapping spit for like the entire history of the solar systems, fossilized bacteria that they found is that been confirmed? No, of it. Most people now think that the Allen Hills, uh, media, right. That probably, you know, it's inconclusive and it's not conclusive enough to be like, yeah, we found life. It's like a tiny little squiggly worm look. And that's what it was. Yeah. But it was so small that it was like way smaller than any of the microscopic fossilized bacteria we've ever seen before. So people in general are like me. Um, but by fine, but that's what started, right. That's when Clinton was like, okay, we're going to send a lot of shit tomorrow. Cause after, you know, back in 90, you're early nineties, people were kind of done with Mars.

Speaker 1:          02:03          And so that's what triggered the whole, you know, one space probe after another, the rovers and like, so you know, the thing we found was a direct result of that effort, which was this organic chemistry, which says that back in the day Mars had had a lot of this stuff lying around, had a lot of these, you know, these, these organic chemicals line around which if your life, that's what you're going to be using. So that's like one more step. Like we've been putting up the Lego blocks for the argument for life on Mars one piece at a time since the, you know, since the first rovers went there. Yeah. If we did discover just even plants on some other planet, even just a planet with some sort of plant like life. Yeah, that would be, that'd be a game changer. Game Changer. Because we don't know if there's, we've, you know, are we the only time in the entire history of the universe that like this crazy thing where got, we went from non life to life.

Speaker 1:          02:54          Like is that common or is that never ever, ever happen. So that's the question we want to, you know, we want to answer and I, you know, I mean like, you know, that argument I was given before is I think from the probable arguments, I'm saying it's like, you know, it's, it's almost overwhelming that you had probably happened somewhere. Again, it doesn't mean anything is here, but we need evidence. Right. Science. So we got to build that evidence. Yeah. And if we do find something, the, the, the one of the weirder things would be if we found something and there was a way to get there. Yeah. You know, we, we find something and we're like, yeah, we find something, but it's, we're pretty sure there's some kind of life and it's 3 billion light years away. Like wow, that's cool. Yeah. What do we do?

Speaker 1:          03:30          Yeah. It's nice to know that we're not the only ones. It's interesting like how much would that change, you know, even if we found like evidence for this, cause this is a debate. Like if we found evidence of a technological civilization we saw like alien mega structures, like that star they felt was that nonsense. And it wasn't really nonsense. It was something floating around. Right? So here's what they saw. So that, you know, the way we discover planets is we look for when the planet passes in front of the star, you get a little dip in the light, right? It blocks out a little bit of light, took a little eclipse. Um, and so, you know, we've now, that's how we should know that every star in the sky has planets, but there's like, they found one that just make no sense. Like the light would dip then what stopped it?

Speaker 1:          04:07          And then it would dip again three times and it would stopped dipping. Sometimes it was lower, sometimes it was higher. Um, and you know, for a year. So people were like, fuck it. You know? And so, uh, Jason Wright and others, a, Jason's a friend of mine, you know, they wrote a paper where they were like, hey, you know, at least cause this is what the future's gonna look like. We can't say, we can't, we have to at least consider the possibility that these are artificial structures that are like orbiting the star, you know? And would have to be ungodly, huge, ungodly, huge alien mega structures. Like that's the best word ever. Like the size of a country, right? Yeah. Yeah. These things would be huge. Right? But that's what people think. Like, you know when people think about advanced alien civilizations, the idea of building large scale structures is you think that maybe the next thing you do once you reach a certain point, like, um, you know, the Dyson sphere, the idea that you could collect all of the sun's energy and use it for yourself by building a giant sphere around the sun with solar panels on the inside.

Speaker 1:          05:00          People think like that goes back to car to chefs. They idea of this Carter chef scale back in the 60s where he's like, look, there's going to be a natural progression of civilizations that goes first. You collect all the energy you can from your planet and then you use that to do amazing things. And then you collect all the energy from your star and then you do that. You know, you do amazing shit with that. And then you know, the whole galaxy. So he know Carter Chef thought there was a scale that that civilizations naturally progress through and hopefully don't blow yourself up along the way. Well, I think that's the question. I mean, I've criticized the, the chef scale in one of the papers I recently did because what it fails to take into account is the fact that like, you know, on your way up to the type one type one is when you harvest all the energy from your planet, which basically means somehow covering your planet in, uh, solar panels or something that neglects what we've learned since Carter Chef wrote his paper in 64, he said, you know, planets don't like that shit.

Speaker 1:          05:47          Like planets, the plants going to feed back. You try and build, you know, massive shit on your planet. The planet has its own, you know, biospheres pretty powerful and you've got to take the biosphere and account or you get climate change. You get had the planet being pushed off in another direction. So, but whatever. So for the, um, for the alien mega structures, people thought like, oh, maybe this is like a piece of an, uh, of a Dyson sphere. Right? This is like, you know, that's so, you know, when he proposed this, people went bonkers over this. Right. You were just saying, he's like, look, here's the 15 different things could be and I'm going to have to at least consider the possibility that it's artificial. Um, but for me, and some people got really angry at everything, but I felt like this is what they get angry because there's been a thing in the community over the years, you know, said he got a bad name, right.

Speaker 1:          06:27          Setting for a bunch of [inaudible]. He was sort of thought as being like, oh, only whackadoodles do that and why? Why is that? Just because there was no results. Ah, I just think, you know, there was, you know, it is, it's because of Shitty TV, you know? I mean, I really, in some ways, right? It's all, you know, it's prosthetic foreheads, right? It's the whole, we've had so much kind of crappy, you know, speculation about aliens. They're trying to do anything scientific. Always had this whiff of sort of being a little, you know, and then there's the Ufo stuff, which is completely separate as nothing to do with it. Let's see. Seti never really achieved any results, right? There was that one big blip that was highly popularized. Wow. Signal. But here's the thing about setting, we never really did set he that much. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          07:07          Like people have this idea like, wow, we've got telescopes all over the world and they're looking at, you know, the government never funded a study study. I bet. Anything Major, right? So people, you know, the, all that said he has done is like basically, you know, some dudes on a telescope get a little extra time like, hey man, I'll quick, let's go look at a star. Right? You know, Jill Tarter, who's one of the founders, one of the greats of Seti, she compares it. It's like, you know, we've got an ocean that we need to look at and we've, so far we've looked at a thimble, right? But she, the Jodie foster care, the Jody foster character, yet we're in contact. Yeah. Yeah. So she's laying on, it's a good point. Like we haven't really looked yet. So the idea that, you know, the stars are silent or anything, it's like, man, come on. We haven't even begun to do a comprehensive service.
