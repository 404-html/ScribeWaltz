Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches because I've hung out with you a lot since it's been three years. We've lost, I've been hot though. It was weird. We're trying to figure it out. We're like, why does it not feel like three wheels three years now since were since I couldn't come in for awhile and I explained this to you on the phone and when we hung out a couple of times my mother was passing from Alzheimer's and then when she did pass it was like I was emotionally incapable. If I would have, cal couldn't even have said those words, I would have been a blubbering idiot on your show. Sure, sure. And you know, you know, whatever. Some people might've been like, hey that would have been great radio. I mean you were the one that said, hey, get your shit together. You know what I mean? Cause I wanted to come here and be, hey, be able to tell if I said it like that.

Speaker 1:          00:39          That would be like Joe k shit together. So your mom's dead Bro. It's us talking. You know what I mean? That's how I said it. I know what you mean. But it would be more like, you know, I went to, it was a, the last four years probably started probably last right before I stopped. The last time I came on the show there was like a big law suit over jump around that I actually wound up winning, but like if froze money that I depend on Brian, like mailbox money, we call that those checks. It just kind of come in and then you're jumping around. It's been really good to me to jump around is one of my favorite hip hop's 25th anniversary this year, the whole first album. So, but point being out, when I first started hanging out with you, because I was such a fan of that song, I was like, I can't believe I know this dude. I remember you were weirded out when I lit a joint in the club and, and you were like, what are you doing? I was like, what do you mean? What am I doing? I'm lying to join.

Speaker 1:          01:32          Everlast goes, he goes, you want to get high? I go, fuck and, and I go where you want to go? He goes, go. He goes, Yo, we ain't going nowhere, but it looks to me like sideways, like go splurge Shit right in the club. And I was like, oh, this is hilarious. Wasn't that that same night that you performed on stage and there was a bunch of musicians and it never worked together on stage. Dave Navarro dated Camp Freddy. They had like a man or they just did a bunch of covers and I remember being a fucked up and they weren't calling me a bunch of times. Nobody ever leaves his nails right there like three or four times before I'm on. What was it like to what is like, yeah, that's true. This is a fucking, that's us all. We're barbecue. There we go. Like, God, I can't see my eyes.

Speaker 1:          02:25          That's exactly the spot we were smoking a joint in too, right? It's exactly where it was bad. I just never remember you looking at me sideways and go and go, oh fuck up. Go what? The hide in the bathroom and smoke a joint. Fuck on here. I took way too good for that bullshit. Especially in Vegas. If any place in the world you're going to be over outlandish tipper, be there because you'll get away with murder. Almost literally the valets, we'll say like, all right Yo, the cops are on their way. You put it, get the fuck out. I'm sure they want to keep them checks coming. Cops are coming with you like it or not. Imagine being a Carbon Vegas, Jesus Christ. How regardless how many people they have down there, Robin casinos and shit. Crazy movie style heist heads with masks on and machine guns and shit taking over casinos.

Speaker 1:          03:15          But um, oh, I was talking about so that I was like so much money got froze. So I was having plus my ass crazy heart like on the road trying to make up the difference for awhile. And then my mother started going way downhill Kinda fast over two years, you know, it was like dealing with that is anybody going through that is is, you know, gets, I mean there's a lot of things that go on in my life. They're getting my heart sent out to those people. Watching somebody you love just disappear. It was tough, man. That was effective. Right. It changes your perspective. You realize that this is, this is how it ends. I had a lot of guilt involved because with a kid with CF, I couldn't have my mom and home with a nurse and any infections that she could, she was getting lung infections all the time.

Speaker 1:          03:56          So I had her in a home, a really beautiful home. They took a magnificent care of my mother. But there was a lot of guilt. I was, I was fricking for a while, like with a lot of darkness that I was swimming through. And as that guy, he's just wasn't good for me to come through. And then, you know, and then after cheap has, and Layla is just been like a learning, you know, I'm only just me and my wife now, it's, she's seven years old and I think, I'm not saying we got anything licked or co, but like the life we have to live, we've been able to figure out with her cystic fibrosis. Yes. With the cystic fibrosis. Oh cause it's all, I mean it's heavy. There's a lot of shit you got to worry about infections and any common cold because senator the hot, it's like so much pressure on a person to to do that.

Speaker 1:          04:42          It's, it's, it's my wife and I like, you know, I won't fucking make it funny. We, we've been very close to the brink a few times, but we've finally gotten to a stage where it was like, Nah, none of that's gonna break us. You know what I mean? We're good and we're good and we're good in this life and theirs and we accept where we are and we're going to make sure this, this young lady is, is going to make it does beautiful as deep and as far into this life as she can. You know? And it's been some medical innovations to right. Having, they're working on some stuff, man. There's a, there's a couple of drugs that aren't quite for her yet because this drug has, in the, on the DNA level of the chain, there's, there's mutations. Layla has two different mutations. One's called the Dell Delta f five five Oh eight I believe it isn't.

Speaker 1:          05:26          You've got me high in a little drunk care, but no, no, no. People know. People who know know it's easy to find out. She has the most calm. That's the most common one, like the Delta five Oh eight, and then she has this other weird kind of offshoot one. There's one. Some people have a dub dealt what they call a double delta. There's a drug right now that's really working well for the people with the Double Delta. They're starting to experiment it on, on it for people with the single. Now does she have to be on a special diet like uh oh the only diet we did, we just need her to, she needs to do, they have a problem gaining weight. Cystic fibrosis, they um, uh, they don't process fats properly. They have to take enzymes with everything they eat. So gaining weights, a real serious issue.

Speaker 1:          06:05          Um, Laila actually has a g tube, a feeding tube that she gets sick, shake the protein shakes a day, pumped into her stomach. Oh Wow. Um, she again, if you're, my daughter very rarely is down about this. She'll have her moments, don't get me wrong, where it's like frustration and anger overheard, but it's, this is life. She's never known anything else. So it's like at the same time, like we post a lot about it. We've, we made a decision. Layla has her own page. People are free to try and follow it. If my wife will approve you, if you can get by the security clearance. Her thing is Layla l a I. L a beauty oh nine. She wanted her own page because we start, I've never posted anything without asking her. Right. Even when she was like barely able to understand, I tried to be like, can I post this picture?

Speaker 1:          06:50          A lot of people will see it and she'll say, okay daddy. And now she might, you know, she's sharp. And uh, about a year or so ago she was like, I want my own Instagram page. I want to share my life, like cystic fibrosis with people. And so she's doing that and we, this is may actually a cystic fibrosis awareness month. So we've been posting and she happened to be in the hospital the last 10 days. She's home right now. Recovering. Um, cello pneumonia. Do an article on a cystic fibrosis treatment. And what was that? Oh, that was a while ago. I don't know. But my wife and I are RF. I did it involve CBDS. I don't remember because I read a semi things and we're investigating some stuff on that level right now because there are a lot of good things going along with this because it's one of them.

Speaker 1:          07:33          It's one of the best anti inflammatories there are when no side effects and all kinds of stuff. We're not using it on my daughter yet, but we're investigating like what kind of uses there are you, I forget I'm going to have to go back through my emails or whatnot. And so she's, I remember you did send me something, I don't remember if it was cbds or stem cells or some shit, but I just saw level now there are a lot of levels they're working on, on the stem cell level there. There's a lot of things going on where it's like if they can create correct things on a cellular level, at some point it's going to be, yeah, there's never going to be a cure. It's a genetic disease. So you can't say cure in that sense. You know what I mean? Like the way it works is my w two p, the two people that are, that fathered a child have to each have the gene.

Speaker 1:          08:10          All right. So me and my wife are known as what, what are known as carriers, which we never knew cause we searched our whole history after we found out. Nobody in my family's ever, ever had this. Nobody in her family ever, ever had this. But we're known as what's carriers. So when we got together and we had a child, there's a one in four chance that child's going to have cystic fibrosis. There's a two and four chance they're going to be a carrier. Oh Wow. There's a one in four chance. They have no nothing at all, which is our other daughter Sadie. So we kind of represent the whole spectrum. Yeah. Like our family, you know, Layla, her mom and me and Sadie. Um, which is another reason I go, I'm not having six kids cause I love being a dad, but it's like two cystic fibrosis children in the same household.

Speaker 1:          08:55          Even in a lot of people do it. It's hard because they pass infections and it's very, as you be, I can't even imagine how the people with multiple, two or three kids with cystic fibrosis pull it off. I hats off because I know what it's like. We're just one that's kind of the, um, of not just t must be changing you as a person. Like think about like how much more compassionate this is made you and how much more appreciative of how I've had to also accept and learn how to deal with a lot of anger. Yeah. A lot of anger. Like, um, uh, I, I consider myself a pretty spiritual person. Like I said, I've explored a lot of religions. Um, I find religions confining, you know, I mean, I believe in a greater power, greater high, whatever, something bigger than us. I kind of believe in that, you know, whether you want to call it God or just are connected collective energy, you what I mean, whatever it might be, somewhere in between their lives, something greater than us.

Speaker 1:          09:51          Um, I felt for another reason the last three years is, is um, what's the captain's name in, uh, in Forrest Gump? Captain Ed or no, Captain. Whoa. The captain, Captain Dan, Lieutenant Dan. I, for the last couple of years, I'm Lieutenant Dan on the top of that fucking sailboat. Like, fuck you, that this is what you're going to do to this little kid. You know what I mean? Watching my child suffer. You know what I mean? There's greater, there's huge injustices in the world. And, and let me tell you another thing, having to take my daughter to children's hospitals all the time, I see people that have it worse. Do you know what I mean? Angela, do you not know? I'm a huge fan. I don't know him personally, but I'm a huge fan. He's a great dude. But one of the things he said to me that I'll never forget, he was uh, talking about the secret.

Speaker 1:          10:39          Do you remember when the secret was this big movie, the book traction and people are going to manifest their own destiny and they were going to make it happen. And everything in your life you created in your mind. And he was like, fuck you. You're telling a young sick kid that she made that herself. She made that he, she made herself have leukemia. She made herself have cancer. You're telling me that fuck you. Fuck you. And when he said that, I was like, wow, I never thought about it that way. But he's totally right. That's exactly what it is. Like you can't, that's ridiculous. You're dealing with a bunch of people that have become successful and told you why. Cause I saw it happening. What about the people that saw it happen and it didn't happen? This is bullshit or a far greater number by the law.

Speaker 1:          11:23          It's a part of life. It's not the whole key to manufacturing a life. It's an excellent like ha being a positive person, being healthy, having a good vision and focus. All those things are contributing factors. But kids that are sick or the monkey wrench in any idea that we've created our own reality, I don't, but you can't make a baby responsible for cancer. That's crazy. You also can't make a god responsible for like, uh, God has a plan, you know? No one, sometimes there's a fucking plan. Sometimes there's a glitch in the goddamn matrix and you just got to deal with it. You know, you got to handle it. And, and the more important thing for me, that second most important thing in my life, other than keeping Layla as healthy as possible, as making sure she knows that, you know, she can still achieve and all that she can.

Speaker 1:          12:16          She's at an age now where like, she kinda, and I, you know, I'm not trying to have her hate me in 10 years if she ever hears this, like we're giving up her business, but she's in a stage right now where she's very resentful of, she is, she expresses it well. She'll say, she'll say, I hate this. I hate that I have this. I just want to be normal. I just want to have a normal life. And it fucking rips your heart out man. But you can't. You have to say, hey, hey, you are normal. This is your life. Your life is normal. It's like Carla, I'm a big Car Lyn guy, you know, mean. I know you're studied student of it, but it's like he had his routine where it's like about being homemade or all natural. He's like, everything's fucking all natural, right. No matter what you do with it, it's all fucking Nashville.

Speaker 1:          12:56          And that's kind of how I tried to approach it. Whether it's like you are normal, this is your normal life. You're not any better or worse or you know, I mean, you have to, there's, there's fights. People fight that you don't even see Layla. You know what I mean? That you don't understand. Yours is obvious years. Is he right here in front of you to fight? Some people are going to fight demons. They'll never meet. Yeah. This is a phrase on that, uh, what is it? Comparison is the enemy of happiness. Thank you. I'm fucking going to use that, Joe. Thank you. That's uh, I'm gonna look it up and I'm going to find out. Find out whose quote that was. Comparison is the enemy of happiness. I really liked that. That's it. That's a very useful, the inspiration sentence. You should get inspiration from other people, but comparison is not really healthy.

Speaker 1:          13:41          Who Was it? A State or Roosevelt said comparison is the thief of joy. Oh, there you go. Perfect. That's so eloquis probably me. I probably fucked up, but that's even better. God Damn Theodore Roosevelt. You bad motherfucker. He was a bad ass mother fucker. Right? And without charging up the hill and San Juan and all that shit, man, comparisons about the first is Theodore. The other one was, well, this is the guy that made the, he, he set aside, um, the national parks system. He set aside like Theodore Roosevelt is the reason why we have the grandkids, which our current guy is trying to rank fucking mantle, not the Grand Canyon. I know camp. Yeah. I was happy about that shit. No, everybody's upset about it. It's, um, well, shout out to Sam Duke.

Speaker 1:          14:22          He's in Alberta Right now. I know. I see him giving you a hard time cam and you, he's so nice. He's a nice guy. As a nice, and people threaten him. He just put, Hey, look at this guy straight at me. What? I threaten you. I wouldn't threaten you and I can probably kill you. Well, the whole, but I wouldn't eat you. That's why I won't kill you. It's a lot of people in other countries, man. A lot of people that get mad about his hunting pictures, they're from some other country. They're all, a lot of them are from South America. Like a Yam. You're going to be, oh God. When the electricity all goes out, they're going to become a man. They're going to be coming to you. He'll be happy as fuck. And I need a recommendation on the beginner bow. I'll, I can hook you up.

Speaker 1:          14:59          Oh, there we go. Yeah. Got Joe's a bone man. Now Dude, I'll get a Hoyt to send you one. You really want to learn. Yes, that'd be the Shit I do. All right, well next time I'm hanging out with John Dudley, I'll have him come and coach you and we'll make a little video. Let me know. Maybe I can attend. Maybe I can jump in. Well that will, I want him to coach you and teach you how to shoot. That's amazing. That would be perfect. We'll do it. We'll make that happen. We'll make that happen. Yeah. So that's three years. Kind of a lot. Condensed Reader's digest version is, I, I emotionally was in prepared to be here and hang out and have fun. I would have been like the, I would have been the like episode that everybody's like, oh, you gotta hear this heart wrenching fucking, oh my God.

Speaker 1:          15:36          Well, it's heart wrenching now, man. But I'm glad she's doing better now, but it's heart wrenching. But, but um, I, I can stay in here like a man and be like, look, here's, I've been through it. Right. You know, you didn't want to see me. And it's like you didn't, it's like you didn't want to see me cowering in the Fox hole. You know what I know now the battle is over. It's like, yeah, I cowered in the Fox hole for a little while, but then we got out and we won the battle, or we, you know what I mean? That's, that's where I want it to be before I came.

Speaker 2:          16:09          Okay.
