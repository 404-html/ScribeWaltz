Speaker 1:          00:00          Think about it as those are the people are taking something away from you. Think about it as they're giving you an opportunity to look at what's possible. If you really dedicate yourself and you should choose that as a valuable life lesson, like, wow, look at that guy doing so well or look at this girl like kicking ass and doing all this. How does she accomplish that? I should write all those things. How does she make all these movies? How did she do all these things like fuck that. People don't do that. The natural instinct is to look at someone who's like some crazy, like super competitive person, like the rock or something like that. Like you see the raw, he's in everything. He's in everything. You want to shit on him, but he's such a nice guy. You can't. It's a real problem like he could do.

Speaker 1:          00:39          That guy could do terrible movie after terrible movie. No one cares because he's such a good guy. He could, he could do whatever he wants. He seemed like a nice guy. He's a very nice guy. He's and he's the real deal. That's really what he does. I mean, that guy really does show up in a fucking hotel room at four o'clock in the morning, flies across the world and immediately starts working out. Wow. He's an animal like a let go. You want to be inspired. That guy's worth more money than everyone. He makes more money than anybody that's ever made any money in movies. He's a fucking junk or not. He's so out of control. Every movie does is a blockbuster. Meanwhile, he still shows up at a place they got to fucking dig out. One of them elliptical machines waiting for him. The guts, weight, weights, weight and form.

Speaker 1:          01:24          He goes to town to do like 45 minutes cardio when he fucking lands flying across the world. Lift weights for an hour, like he just keeps going. He just keeps going. He finds a way to not complain, stay positive and just keep going. I read it. I read half of his book and I'm very like, that's a lot for you and I remember that when you have p he was third string and playing football in Canada. He was living up. It will share the mattress with the, with the last guy who, who got kicked out of a team, Jesus fog to be now a superstar. I mean, I don't even know how many millions he makes a movie, but everybody sees his movies. He's such a good guy, but he hears be really clear that kind of genetics like what that guy is that is just like we were talking about with Iceland.

Speaker 1:          02:12          That's the same shit. That's the same shit with the Pacific islands, man. That's some warrior DNA son. That's a giant man. That's a huge, super powerful man who fucking is so driven. Like we are lucky. We are lucky. That dude is not on the biggest fucking horse he can find with the biggest battle. Battleaxe. I mean that's what these people come from, man. You don't get to be that big if you don't have like some sort of a, a great lineage of warriors behind you. You mean this debt so much bigger than most people because it's Schwarzenegger. He so big. But all those guys, like that guy that plays the mountain on game of Thrones. Like what in the holy fuck, that guy's so big. You know that that dude came out of some war, your bloodline, some crazy viking blood line because before guns, that was what was most important. So when you see a guy like the rock or you see it, God, you're like, wow, that guy looks like a conqueror. Yeah, because that's what he comes from 100% like he's the lorry warrior that due to place door. What's that dude's name? Chris Hemsworth isn't worth that. That dude. Listen

Speaker 1:          03:27          that he's a goddamn specimen or aqua man. What is this Jamie body comparison of the rock to the mountain. Who is the mountain mountains behind him? 150 pounds on him. Oh my God. Oh, the mountain from game of Thrones. Oh, sorry. Holy Shit. Put that again. Look how much bigger he is. That's like, that's significant in a good like six seven inches. He's so big it guy so big. I'll tell you the six, nine or some shit. Six nine. Dude, that is so crazy. I weigh more than both of them. That's not true. Oh Wow. No. The mountain weighs like 390380603 86 he's six foot nine he weighs 386 pounds.
