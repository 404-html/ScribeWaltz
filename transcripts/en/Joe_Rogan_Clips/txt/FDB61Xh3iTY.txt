Speaker 1:          00:00          Right? I love that fight. Marvel studios do. Superheros are they? If they run out of superheroes, get this shit on my people at this rate. I don't know who is this in Samuel Jackson is a different superhero now. Who? This is at the end of the Avengers movie. Hey Samuel Jackson. Say No to some captain marvel. Well, who is, wait a minute. Captain Marvel's a girl and she and she brings all of them back to life. Wait a minute. Who was captain marvel when we were kids? Uh, dude, wait a minute. I'll look. I don't know. It's amazing that it's not a trans woman. That would be dope. That's what they're going to be enough trans. Who's a weightlifting champion? Come sit down and cheese. No cheese. People get mad. People get the cheese chewing on the microphone. Sued. We're pros, man. You guys are tear a couple of one, two pros.

Speaker 1:          00:57          Cheesy dude. If you didn't bring stuff in provolone fresh. Okay. Okay. Hey, how about this fight? [inaudible] Huseman versus Tyron Woodley. I love that. That's March 2nd. Come on it. He's our second watch guys, come, come, come to Vegas. Okay here. Captain Marvel was a guy in a girl in the kid. She was hot. They just picked one. But that's from 2017 men. This is when it's already been diverse. 19 nine Captain Marvel, dude, give me type in 1992 Spiderman and captain marvel. 1956 when I was about this, this spider verse movie that just came out, it's like only a four year old Spiderman story. It's if it's not some old thing they brought back. That's cute. That's a cartoon. The captain captain. Marvel's old school. No. Yeah, but what are those? Spiderman is like a duck, right? He's a pig bro. It's a great movie. Best movie I've seen in a long term.

Speaker 1:          01:54          Bruce Lee into a superhero like powers. My kids said Nate to the fucking legos movie and when you want to see the lego movie that played out, it's good. We've seen the other ones. My son loves the Lego movie. Oh, it's the new one. Both of them. A new one just came out. How many have there been there? Only two. Really. So cool. That Batman's a douchebag girlfriend. Right? And then the girlfriend because Han Solo pulls up in the Millennium Falcon and mistake, wait a minute. This is the old captain marvel, but he was Zam Zam Zam also known as captain marvel terms in marvelous. She's dude, if you held a gun to my head and asked me is Shizam DC or marvel? I would have said cities DC for sure. Yes, yes. Do you remember? That's what I was trying to say. There was a captain marvel character in the DC comics universe from back then.

Speaker 1:          02:53          I don't know. That's what you remember the marvel as one that existed. So that's the confusion. That's just an movie. Looks like. Is it like someone from dela Torre are fighting someone from the UFC? It's confusing, dude. All I know, she comes back and you know how everyone died in the last one. Spoiler, it's been up for an hour a year, so fuck off. She brings everyone back to how the fuck she do that. That's the comic books dude. Do you remember in a Lego movie when Batman, he leaves his girl to jump in the Millennium Falcon with Han Solo and Chewbacca, and he says later, so he jumped in, he thought he was going to party like in space, and then he comes back. They go, what happened? He goes, turns out that wilkies a dude that was fucking hilarious. There was no chicks because there there's no chicks on the Millennium Falcon, the android to to dig marble 1968 but scroll down.

Speaker 1:          03:47          First appearance was the image of a female. The girl 68 wow. This picture from 2012 but here's the deal. Girls weren't built like that back then. They're building. It's a new thing now. Those are you. Scroll down. Let me see that image. That's all. I got. A Primo crossfit chick. That's legit. That's a new version of her. Oh, that's 2012 yeah, that's a UFC fighter chick. Right? Okay. That's what they used to look like. Wow. There's multiple captains on a marvel, so captain marvel, sometimes a guy, sometimes a girl. That goes both ways. It goes both ways and you will know, can relate to it. We're just like, hey, whatever, whatever. But they run a silver surfer. There's so many superheros that they have like 10 different ones on Netflix. Man. A man, shit, fuck fucking Tommy wasp girl or some shit. I can't fuck with that. Or aqua man, get that shit out of me. This is a good fight to Brian Barbarina in [inaudible]. Luke K is a good fight if we didn't watch miles jewelry. Let's be real. Oh, this is a good fight now for sure. This is a good one.
