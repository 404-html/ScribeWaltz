Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. Like I didn't smoke blunts until I hung out with Charlie Murphy. Really? Charlie used to smoke legit blunts. Like he had his cousin rich who had rolled these legit blondes out of like Swisher sweets. Take out the tobacco, leave like a little bit in and then roll it up with weed and then lick it down and we would get home.

Speaker 1:          00:24          Yeah, nervous. Hi. Terrifying high. He was one of the hardest deaths that I ever had to deal with. Really? Yeah, because I wish I contacted him more. I wish we got together more, but we were always on the road. You know that guy's a man. Like he was a, he was a real man, like, like, like he never had any like weird shit yet a work through. He was, he always held his mud. Like Charlie was different man. He was like a guy who didn't come into celebrity at all until his forties so was developed. He was a real man that's loves that guide. So it's one of those guys like sometimes you get tired, you get tired, you're just doing too many things and you've for forget to concentrate on people that you've run into in your life that you're like, God damn, that guy was a good dude.

Speaker 1:          01:13          Like Charlie Murphy was a good motherfucker. Like he had a joke on stage that talked about it wasn't trying to, but he was like, he goes, people say to me, you know that people yell out Chai Man. Hey John and Matt, hey. He goes, hey man said, have a bother you. It's just yells out Charlie Murphy. Every time he seen he goes, no. He goes, because for the first time in my life it was like, hey you Eddie Murphy's brother. Right? Anybody laugh about it onstage, like slap as ne and like that was real for him. Sure. We got to experience a guy who like went through a whole life as a grown man and was approaching middle age before fame kicked in wild man. He only had like a 10 15 year ride before he died. Yeah. Was a good dude, man. The magnitude of like, you know that show, but like particularly like two sketches, like that's how big an impact.

Speaker 1:          02:11          Those two sketches, they would just play that I remember when he started a tour, you know when you go to the clubs they play it before. Oh, just that like of the teaser that he's coming coming next week or two weeks from now. It would be just like a little bit of like the Rick James Sketch or the print separate and fucking all the shows be styled. Man. You know what man, he didn't, man, I really feel like there's a developmental process that you can apply to like UFC fighters and even stand up comedians. If you take a guy who's got some potential, then you make them fight Anderson Silva in his prime when he's 20 years old and he gets knocked unconscious, he's never going to be the same again. Yeah. And I almost feel like this is the same thing with comedians. I don't care if you're 40 or 50 or 60 or 20 to go onstage and eat is horrific.

Speaker 1:          03:00          Yeah. And what Charlie did was he went from being a guy who was on the supple show to hosting a show with other comedians like Darnell. Yeah. And a and Dave and whoever was on the show and talking a little like, Hey, what's up? And instead of just continuing to do that, he started headlining cause that where the money, that's where the money was. No, no up and Mike famous. So bringer shows. No, no dude, we did 22 dates together, 22 days together and we swapped. Who went back and forth? Like he headlined one. I had one, one, he and mine one, I headlined one and he just fucked member. Those Doug, his seat. Who have either when you were on, well I swapped, but I did three. I did Irvine, San Diego, and Phoenix. And so damn, you did three different people in different nights.

Speaker 1:          03:47          But I saw, yeah, I saw him. I saw him struggle when I must've been rough. Oh my God. And then I saw him actually do really well the next night. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Well if he can get on the middle spot, he could do pretty good. He was a funny dude, but it's just not, it's not a good number. It's not the right place to put some money. His mega millions joke. Do you remember he was doing that? You had a bunch of great jokes. He had a bunch of gay jokes. Man. He was a funny and and offstage, maybe one of the funniest guys of all time. He took me to dinner on that thing, which I didn't expect and I don't think rich wanted me to come and, and like we went out to dinner and he was, yeah, no, no, no. He, his cousin, his cousin. But he was as, he was like, what you like that show was fresh. That was, you know, and like he, he was telling stories. He was, he told the story that I texted you to ask him when you had them on. I go ask him if he could let go if Johnny guilt. Yeah, cause it fucking Mike Tyson Tiger story. Yeah. Oh, that's what you're going to story. Pet Tiger. No one want to get out of the limousine. Yeah. So

Speaker 2:          04:55          crazy though. Did you ever hear the busboys story? Which ones? That Charlie Murphy. When is Eddie let him borrow clothes? No. Oh my God. That's so funny. That's so funny. I'll never do it justice. And it's so good when he tells it. No, you got to tell it. You got to tell it cause then I can sit available online so you gotta find it. So see if you can find, you know, you're never gonna be able to find it cause it's in snoop Dogg's podcast. Oh, all right. Oh I bet. I bet someone's put it on Youtube. I know Bert Kreischer did. I fucking grabbed it the day he died. And I was like, this is one of the best stories I've ever, that's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's where I saw it. Yeah. But I don't know how I put it online. But anyway, to make, he gets, he comes out of the navy and he comes out to La and then they all want to go out to a party. But all these guys, navy clothes, he's just out and ed, he's the biggest fucking movie star on earth. Right. So his brother is like, and it's young primetime. Oh is this it? Yeah. Oh, just play this place. Give me some shit high. When Eddie had to

Speaker 1:          05:57          fly outfits, did you ever like take that away?

Speaker 2:          05:59          Oh Man. You know what he did like Nigga, take my shit off. One of the most brutal, brutal experiences, outfits. I first got out the navy, I came out to La and my brother was huge, right? So we hanging out at different tables. He had, you know, show business clothing. He was supposed to have it. No, he was just showman. Everybody knew he was. So he happened to own a glitter busboy. Jack up from the boys are back in town. Bus Boy Jack. And we was going out to the, it was a century 21 over there. Then there was a club over. He said, Yo man, you want to wear this jacket? So the jacket was a green glitter busboys Jack. I'm trying to get my stamp coming out of the navy. All I had was uniform. I put the busboy jacking or they had my chains and all that. And then we went to the club and I thought I was coming and walking through the club and I hear everybody go, yeah, Mrs Eddie Murphy from New York who's up behind the group that they could do, which I don't know, it looked like [inaudible]. I was like, Yo man, the, and started burning gas, sit down with somebody, just poured kerosene on, executive lit this shit up.

Speaker 1:          07:24          Ah,

Speaker 2:          07:26          do you know when he died? I used to enjoy and I knew this would be a Tom cause you guys a tour with him. He was like, you don't know how funny is he thought he could fight Billy Gill? No, he said that Johnny Gill, Johnny Gill, we're looking at the screen and his ass. He's like, you think Oscar de la Hoya could fuck you up? And I was like, yeah. He's like, I know. Right? And I was like, yeah man, he's a professional. He would ruin your life. And he was like, Johnny Gill thinks he could fuck him up. I was like, what? And then he started telling a story about how he was hanging out with Johnny Gill and Johnny Gill just looked at TV and was like, I could fuck up to Oscar de la Hoya. And he was like, what are you talking about man? In the way that child, he's like, Oscar de Hilbert Bray rearrange the whole way. You Shit. Look man. And, and Johnny gale was like, no, he's pretty. He's like, that don't mean shit.

Speaker 1:          08:17          Punch a hole in your face. Charlie Charlie Murphy was at dinner with Maury Smith who is a former UFC heavyweight champion of the world. I haven't salivary who's a former UFC fighter who actually had a move that we started crying the salivary. Remember Ivan? Ivan had a move where it was what wasn't really his mood, but it was a move that he was one of the first guys to tap somebody with it where he got the triangle from the back and elevated his hips to like press down on your back. Guys were tapping out from like getting triangled from behind. We started realizing like how dangerous that movie, so I haven't salivary, it's like a time tested warrior, right? So Maurice Smith, former heavyweight champion Ivan salivary, Charlie Murphy is explaining why y'all Niggas don't know about the Chicago Ridge. Hey, please explain. And some particular like martial arts move.

Speaker 1:          09:09          It's called the rich hand and it's a strike and I don't know what the Chicago rich hand was, but Charles was insistent that no one was trying out the Chicago Ridge hand in MMA and that people could do it. And like they were laughing and Charlie was like, no, fuck you. He goes, you tell me. I don't, I don't hit you in the head with a rich hand. Red Ban took a picture and I put it up on my Instagram. I find it. It's Charlie Murphy standing up. How are e Smith and the Ivan Salad right now like this? Like Ah, Charlie's got his hand up at this time. Roddy chopping something on the bridge. They notes. I'll hit you on the bridge. He, oh no, dude, we were, we were, it's like fancy fucking Ruth's Chris Steak House somewhere. Yeah. Cry.

I'm wish I was in this photo, but I was crying too, but I was probably under the table at this point. Like I did that podcast with Joe. It was like the same sort of situation I said under the table crying at that point. Like, I love you guys, but I got to head out. We're all going to go. This is the point. Like Ralphy like Charlie, like everybody, we're all going to go. You know, the quicker you realize that, the quicker you get that in your head, the more you'll enjoy this weird time we're in the sunshine right after the rain. It doesn't last. It's a good time to be a comic. It's good time to be alive. But is it the human race as a person? All of us, there's no, no one gets out alive. No. One quicker. We remember that. The better. We're all be not work.
