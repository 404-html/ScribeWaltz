Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches.

Speaker 2:          00:03          And that's the problem with that, with a lot of what's happening in our government. People saying, you know what, I really want to believe in this absurd story and therefore I refuse to accept evolution. If you're the vibe, if you're Mike Pence, the vice president of country, you say, I don't believe evolution because I don't, it doesn't agree with my ridiculous fundamentalist ideas. And he said that in Congress, right? He said, we shouldn't be teaching evolution in schools. We should be teaching intelligent design. And, and why? Because he, he, it, it offends his personal faith.

Speaker 1:          00:32          Perhaps it might also be a political ploy. It might be. I think he's, he knows that a large percentage of the country finds comfort in a leader that subscribes to the same sort of superstitions that they did. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:43          Yeah. I, I, that could be a, he did this before. He was in a national officer. He was a congressman. I suspect he did it. It sounds like he believed it, but you're right. Who knows. Right. But, but the point is that we, we, we should realize that the only, that, that we shouldn't listen to that kind of nonsense because we may not want, because there are a lot of people in this country who do think that evolution directly confronts their belief in God or the Big Bang directly confronts their belief in God and therefore they don't want their children to learn about that. But what an awful thing to do to your children to withhold evidence about how the world really works. Because you don't, you don't have to believe in the big bang, but it really happened. You don't have to believe in evolution.

Speaker 2:          01:26          But it happened. It's like Philip k Dick said the, the, the science fiction writer reality is that which continues to exist, whether or not you believe in it. Okay. And so you may not want to believe in it, but it happened. And, and for you to withhold that kind of knowledge from your kids because you're worried it's going to affect their faith is, in my opinion, child abuse because you're hindering their capabilities as an adult in a society which is highly technological to function effectively. They're doing it because they believe in as well when they need. It's right. I'm not believing they think they're helping their kids, but most of, I don't know if you're a parent. I am. We've all screwed up our kids, right? Yeah. We all do things for our kids because we think it's good for them and, and sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't. I'm not saying these people are doing it because they, they want to hurt their children. They think somehow that not believing in God makes you a bad person. Right. But there's no evidence of that. In fact, in fact, a Steve Weinberg who a Nobel prize winning physicist has said, and I love it, he, he, he said, so they're good people in the world. They're bad people, good people to good things, bad people do bad things. When good people do bad things, it's religion.

Speaker 1:          02:31          Do you think that religion in its earliest stages was in a sense primitive man with no science trying to figure out the world and trying to have some sort of rules like almost like a scaffolding in order to, to move to the next. If you see that it exists in so many different cultures, it might have been something along that

Speaker 2:          02:54          was that way. It their effort. It was their effort to understand the world around them based on what they knew it was noble. You know, they tried to understand the world and so there's nothing wrong with it. But claiming that we today should be guided by the worldview of, of illiterate peasants in the Iron Age. Peasants who, who didn't know the earth, orbiting the sun and wrote down scriptures based on their beliefs at the time. They'll argue that that should guide our life. Today when we discovered a hundred billion galaxies in the universe and discovered all this stuff is ludicrous. So you're absolutely, the birth of science and religion are the same. And in fact, modern science grew out of religion. People point that out and they say to me, how dare you talk about religion? You know, as, as being outdated. Science grew out of religion. And I say to them, well that's fine, but children outgrow their parents, right?

Speaker 2:          03:41          So great. No doubt, religious ideas and all early scientists were religious because it was the only game in town. You couldn't be educated except the church controlled all the universities. And so it was like the National Science Foundation of the 16th century. It's not surprising they were all religious because that's, that was the only game in town. So that, that co helped create the birth of modern science. But science outgrew it and that's okay. Kids outgrow their parents. Thank goodness. Well, I think maybe that might help kids outgrow their parents. Why the getting religion forced down your throat is one of the best ways for kids to, for some kids as they get older. Some for some kids it's like you and me, but I get lots of letters. You know, we made this movie called the unbelievers and, and about, which followed me, Richard Dawkins and I around the world as we talked about this stuff.

Speaker 2:          04:29          And it was nice and maybe, and I, and I hope, and it's a, it's a well made film. I liked the moat filmmakers made it, but I found people come up to me. I had no idea of this. It's one of the negative aspects of religion that I never appreciated. I have people come up and he almost everyday or write me and saying, you know what? I saw that movie and I realized I'm not a bad person for asking questions and I'm not alone. You know, these people from small towns in Georgia, they have no one to talk to. They think that the only ones who's asked the question, is God real? Is it okay to not believe in God? And they're told by everyone else he'll not only you'll go to hell, but you're a bad person and suddenly they discover that's not true.

Speaker 2:          05:07          And so I think there are a lot of people who have that forced down their throats. It's really hard when you're a kid, you know, and have these. And that's why I do think any kind of religion for kids is kind of child abuse not. And no matter what, because these concepts of a dainty and the possible existence of a purpose of university are very deep and subtle concepts and expect a three year old kid to, to, to Ram that down at cure all kids' throat is unfair because the kid rested it. It ends up being internalized in ways. And a lot of people, you know, I hear a lot of people who've had deep religious educations who say, you know, it's hard to outgrow that because when you get, when that's rust into you as a child, it's really hard to over ever overcome it.

Speaker 2:          05:48          The guilt feelings that many religions introduce the fundamental notion that, that you know, you're ultimately sinful and no matter what you do is sinful, is something a lot of people have hard times with. And that claim of sin is just so you know, I've debated people who you know, who argue that homosexuality is, is, is, is sinful, you know, and then, and it's unnatural. God intended it to be otherwise. And then I pointed out, well, you know what? You take all mammals 10% in every species, almost 10% have homosexual relationships. Sheep have long 10% of sheep of longterm homosexual relationships, or they sinful. Okay? It's not a natural at all. It's a natural consequence of whatever by now why it's a case. It's an interesting evolution of question, but it's certainly not a natural and seems uniform. Then if it's 10% plus or minus a little bit, it certainly seems to be biology.

Speaker 2:          06:41          There's some purpose. There's some, there's some biological purpose to it. And so to argue that it's both unnatural and wrong is to misunderstand biology. But people grow up being told it's evil because the Bible said it. And then they don't want to give people who homosexual the same rights as other people because they tell them, they say God didn't want them to have the homestead. So the problem is people are told these things that are ultimately wrong because you know, maybe, you know, because for whatever reason, the tribe that wrote down that that scripture wanted to make sure that the, there weren't homosexual relationships in the group, which is really baffling when you talk to people about the Bible in the Old Testament versus the new testament. And they don't even understand where the new testament was created by Constantine and a bunch of bishops. They threw a bunch of stuff.

Speaker 2:          07:29          And by the way, they think it's kindler gentler. Sure. The Old Testament is one of the most, you know, look at the current people say the Qur'an is violent and vicious. Read the Old Testament. You know, you're supposed to stone your kids if they disobey you. And the reason kill people that were two different types of cloths. Exactly. And the reason that nowadays sort of the old Abrahamic religions of Judaism and Christianity may seem a little less violent than Islam for some people, is because, you know, people take the Quran literally, and that's part of sort of fundamentalist Islam. Very few, very few people take the Bible as literally as it namely, Hey, we're going to stone kids in the 12th century. They may have, but now we've outgrown it. And the Islam is 600 years younger. And so it's, it's just the old testament is just as violent as the Qur'an, but no one takes it seriously.

Speaker 2:          08:17          But people, most people who call themselves religious, they pick and choose the things they like from the Bible or the New Testament or the old testament. They pick and choose the nice kinder, gentler things. You know, Richard Dawkins Foundation in England did an interesting survey. Uh, so they, the British government does a census, you know, and, and they, they ask people's religions as part of it. And in the last census, remarkably only 55% of the people said they were Christian Church, Church of England, which was one of the lowest ever. But fine, they went to those 55% people. They did a survey of those and they said, okay, why do you call yourself Christian? Do you believe in the Virgin birth? Do you believe in transubstantiation? Do believe in, you know, and went down the list and people say, no, no, no, no, no. And then they'd ask, why do you call yourself Christian?

Speaker 2:          08:59          And the answer was, we like to think of ourselves as good people. So religion is USERP morality. And somehow people throw out all of the evil. And it's not just the Old Testament. No one talked about hell more than Jesus Christ. Okay? Jesus guy is supposed to love. Everyone talked about hell. This eternal damnation for people who disobey as, as, as Christopher Hitchens used to say, God is like a cosmic Saddam Hussein, but worse cause it almost saying use just torture his enemies while they're alive. God has worse. He takes the people that I was like, it torches them from all eternity. Who wants such a God? What an awful, disgusting idea.

Speaker 3:          09:46          Okay.
