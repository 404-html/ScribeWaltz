Speaker 1:          00:00          So when you're dealing with some certain accusations when it comes to human beings like this, Chris Hardwick things. And a perfect example of that, I mean he was just reinstated yesterday by AMC and um, yeah, that's a weird one because she wrote the, it was an ex girlfriend that wrote something about him. Yeah, I read that. Well, she clearly didn't tell the truth about some aspects of their relationship. She cheated on him and that's why he got rid of her or broke up with her. And then she also said he was just terrible boyfriend and he did all that. But then there's videos of her talking about what an amazing boyfriend he was while they were together, about how he stayed with her in the hospital and slept by her bed. And it's like, and she was also, she had a bunch, a host of mental illnesses that she described in their video about like not being able to drive down the street with the windows open because she's worth it.

Speaker 1:          00:49          Germs going to get in her car. And some of those she recovered from and some of them she didn't like. It's an Oh, there's another problem with people when it comes to when they're talking about things they might not even be allying. Yeah, they just might be. They just might have a distorted perception of reality. That is another problem with human beings when it comes to any sort of interaction between two people, especially after a break up. I think the way that a person can view the time they spent with someone can very much change based on, you know, their current situation or how that breakup happened. 100% yeah, but on both sides. The, the real problem though is what, what we were saying is that human beings, it's very difficult. I can't read minds. You can't read minds. You can't look into memories. So we're relying on a person's description and then we have to rely on what we know about them, what, how, how, what, what, what we know about their ability to describe things accurately, what we know about their perceptions of reality.

Speaker 1:          01:47          They're delusions there. There, there, there, there, there clarity. It's fucking super tricky. I mean, my rule of thumb, what I would say to people is, unless you know the two people, I don't think you can ever really know what happened. So in that case of say you leave and Jamie tells you, I said something about you, you're probably going to go with Jamie, right? Cause you know him. So I would say the same. He's a little crazy. I'm like, I'm like, oh yeah. I mean it's for sure. If I didn't know you and Jamie told me you did something fucked up, I would side with Jamie. But even that's weird cause like if I'm not there, if I don't know, if you say I didn't do anything, I'm like well maybe one day you'll be my best friend and maybe a of one day Jamie turn out to be a fucking psycho.

Speaker 1:          02:32          I was like, remember when we used to think Jamie was okay, he's fucking crazy. But that's the thing too. I think sometimes with, I do empathize with some of the women who say if this happens to the men and people say, well that's a nice guy. I know that guy. That's my buddy. I've known him forever. But you didn't date him. So how do you know? You don't know, right? Yeah. You don't know. God Damn it. It's fucking tricky. You know, if you ever seen that episode of black, do you ever watch Black Mirror watched one episode? So everyone tells me how amazing this show is and I think it is amazing. But I saw one episode that really freaked me out. So no, it was the one about, um, it was actually about a of the boy who was a pedophile and then he was being watched and blackmailed creeped me out.

Speaker 1:          03:14          But there's one called crocodile. Okay. And it is easily the most disturbing episode of a television show I've ever watched in my life. And it, it has to do with technology that allows people to read memories. Okay. And I'll leave it at that because I had no spoiler alerts here, but until fucking dark stays with you after this one does, this one's dark. I mean this, I mean I can't, I can't, I will give too much away if I talk about it, but the concept is that you can, they have a machine and they set this machine up and through this machine they can literally read your memories until that happens. We really don't know. And you know, there's been things in my life where I looked back on it and I had a perception and then I went to the place where I grew up and I was like, I don't remember it looking like this.

Speaker 1:          04:07          I don't remember this being so close. Oh, the streets right here. This is where the house is. Oh. And then you have to kind of like remap your memories. Like, okay, we got to clean these memories up and try to figure out what's accurate and what's not. But then this is, I'm just talking about like this, the neighborhood where I grew up in, but what about your adding in emotions? Then you add, again, painful emotions because of breakups and perhaps suicidal thoughts and yes, time. Sure. I mean, it's been absolutely proven that eye witness testimony is the least accurate piece of evidence that any investigator can ever use in terms of like trying to figure out what happened at the scene of a crime or anything involving any sort of trauma.
