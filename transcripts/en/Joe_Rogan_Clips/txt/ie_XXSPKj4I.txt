Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches, you know all that power already. Like why would he, why would he want to be the president? It just seems like such a fucking helacious job. Unless he really feels like he can fix things or he's really gonna make a ton of money from it. I mean this is a guy who plasters his, his fucking name on buildings and Shit, you know. So I think it's really just a matter for him of like, this is part of my legacy. You know, towards the end of my life I was president of the United States. It's so weird. It's so weird cause it's, it's another version of what many people did with Obama in this weird way in that when Obama got into office, there was all these, a really, really rational people that said all kinds of crazy shit. And by the way, Trump was amongst them.

Speaker 1:          00:48          He was a birther. Yeah, he was a member for the longest time. He was convinced. Somebody convinced him. I Dunno who convinced him. I Dunno if you've ever really relinquished it and realize that it was wrong or if he still holds onto the idea. Did he ever really believe it too? I don't know. You know, I don't know. But you know who started that whole birth of thing? Hillary Clinton. Yeah, she did. That's right. That's something that people forget. It was during the, uh, the campaign between her and a Obama when they were trying to get the nomination in 2008. Yeah. Yeah. She, she had, well she had one of her little org send out materials that you know, showed Obama and like the, like he was wearing like some African Muslim garb. Shit. Cause he went on a visit to some other company. You look at him, you know, he's Muslim and uh, you know, and Trump just ran with that.

Speaker 1:          01:39          Yeah. Or a lot of Republicans did to cause, you know, well I guess that's just how they play politics. They have some like that, they just run with it. It's just so strange to see when you got a candidate named Barack Obama. I know, you know it's easy Hussain who saying Obama like Barack Hussein Obama Sane in that the guy you know ran a racket and Obama, it had the similar to the name of the guy that crashed those planes into the towers and yeah, somebody had a Joe really good, well wrote a joke. I don't remember who it was though. It might've been 20 inch glove but I mean it's just, this is almost a s a similar reaction. I don't mean it's less, it's more rational or less rational. What I mean is almost like the energy of the reaction, like the energy of the birthers and the guys who were convinced that he was some sort of undercover Muslim and then he was going to get into the White House and tried to take America down from the inside.

Speaker 1:          02:34          Like that feeling that the amount of energy that way is mirrored now on the left. Maybe even though, yeah, maybe even past I would say probably I might not be right cause I might not be remembering it perfectly. But I feel like the energy on the left of people getting mad at Trump is more powerful or more, there's more to it than the energy that I saw from people on the right. They wanted Obama out of office, but it might just be my memory. And you got to remember too, there's like an age gap there. Yeah. Cause you know, most of the people who were talking that shit about Obama were, were pretty old. Right, right. And a lot of the people now that are pissed or really young, so they're more likely to take to the streets and you know, smash things and hold up signs and you know, act wild and shit and mace people.

Speaker 1:          03:19          Yeah. And I perspire when Bush took office though, like when Bush, uh, was, was being inaugurated, I remember he was driving down, uh, to the, to the White House during the inauguration day. And they were, you know, with, with Trump, the protesters kinda came the next day. But with, when Bush was inaugurated, the protesters were all there the day of. And you know, Bush couldn't even do the little traditional walk down the last few blocks of the, the journey because there was so many protestors and people were just throwing things at the fucking motor Cade and shit. So I mean like this is not unusual, but that was towards the end. No, that was the very beginning. What am I, which 1:00 AM I thinking of? Wasn't there one towards the very end that I think we're thinking of different ones. Okay. I think I'm, my memory's fucked up, but I think there was one towards the end where they had planned on having him walk down some long stretch and they had to abandon it and get them into car.

Speaker 1:          04:18          Is that the same stores? Uh, yeah. Well I think that was both times. I think it was the first, but even during his first time, like when he was just first being inaugurated president in 2000 so right after Clinton, like that inauguration was bad. It was almost the same. Yeah, it was terrible. It was almost the same as what you see now because people had had this Democrat in power for eight years and they thought like, yeah. And they thought Gore is a shoe in because Clinton's popular just same as like Hillary's a shoe in because Obama's popular. Right. But you know, a Republican ended up taking it and, and they just freaked out. And it seems like that always just happens. I mean like this kind of like backlash, like it always is kind of sold to us as like this is new, this is like, Oh wow, look at what's going on now.

Speaker 1:          05:06          Isn't this crazy what crazy times we live in? But it's, I look back at my memories of the past and it seems like this is pretty par for the course. I think you're right. Now that I'm thinking about it, it's almost like we go through these like cycles. Yeah. And if a president gets past one cycle removed from his, his tenure, then people forgive them. They forget and they changed their opinion. Yeah. Like Reagan, like, man, when I was a kid, Reagan was a pariah. Like people were so upset about Reagan, they were so upset. And there was the contra versus Nicaragua, uh, trial that was on television with Oliver North and we were finding out on TV, like whether or not the government had sold arms and lied about it and weather then, you know, the, the whole Reagan thing was the one that Reagan sold arms to Iran, the great Jimmy Tangle, hilarious standup comedian in Boston has this bit about it because they, well, that was when Reagan started claiming all timers or when he claimed memory issues, which turned out to be true.

Speaker 1:          06:11          I mean, you really did. I have memory issues and he probably did it a time, but they asked him, did you sell arms to Iraq? I said, I don't know. And Jimmy Tangles, like mister president, if you ever sell to people, hate us, jot it down, was like, make a note, put it on the refrigerator today. I sold Amz to people who hate me. You have to hear him. I mean, you know, it, it, it, you have to realize though, like America's always has been a huge arms dealer. I mean, we're constantly selling weapons. Oh yeah. I mean like if he, if he didn't remember why he did it, it's probably because there were just so many other transactions. I don't think the president personally gets involved too much in that sort of stuff. But no, probably not. Country sells weapons all over the place and we continue to do that.

Speaker 1:          06:54          Yeah. My point was there like eight years later, he was the great Ronald Reagan. Oh yeah. Eight years late. Lion eyes goes through the Clinton administration. Everybody's done with Clinton getting his dick sucked and the White House and all that craziness. And, and then as soon as that's over, people start reminiscing to Reagan. It's really interesting. It's really interesting how we do it. And so now Bush went through this period of being hated and he's out of office at Obama, goes through his period of being hated for eight years. And now that, and even more unreasonable Republicans in office, people long to the Bush day. Oh yeah. Like you, you notice their trot and Bush out and keep doing interviews with them. Like, Hey, remember this war criminal now he's okay. Well, he's, he's uncle Bush Bush here, uncle Bush going to set you on his knee. They um, super important.

Speaker 1:          07:44          What does that protests during the Bush administration eyes and Augie aerations. Yeah. Yup. Wow. What does it say and fuck Bush. Oh, buck flush, flush. There's a couple of years. My President of course, man, of course. So you know, this is, this is all so cyclic. Yeah. It just happens over and over again and people think it's new and the, you know, for some, I think, I guess it's, it's the country just has a short memory to what a crazy show. This is what a crazy show we're watching the battle to control the world. Yeah. Political Theater, pageantry. But you know, like it's just, I mean like I don't want to get into like you already had Alex Jones on the show, so I can't really get in to that level of territory. But I mean, I do agree that these parties are constantly just working together behind the scenes, and that 90% of the issues they agree on, they just make a big spectacle of the little things they actually disagree on. To distract us with a show. You look, America, look, look at us. We're fighting. We're fighting. Right? How'd they stopped paying attention? Okay, now we've made it. Now we do the real deals. Who are we going to bomb? Who are we going to invade? You know, uh, who are we going to sell weapons to? Whatever. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          09:07          Yeah.
