Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. I just don't want to be the weakest link ever on a film. So, so that's what you want to do when you're done with all that? For sure. For sure.

Speaker 2:          00:09          Did you, is that always been an aspiration or is it something you saw? I was like a way to do it after.

Speaker 1:          00:14          Oh Man. Got a lot of stuff, you know, I don't really even like fighting real honest. Yeah, I'm just good at it. What don't you like about it? I don't like the politics behind it. I don't like the, a martial art aspect has been taken away from it. I don't like to um, disrespect to the sport. Um, guys that are not, not really training hard. Um, it don't look the part. I think professional athletes, you'll look a certain way. Um, I really just don't like the youth. Um, this generation of fighters at watching move on TV on youtube and they're going, they tried to do it. They don't want to drill repetitious lead. I don't want to actually put in the work. Um, why does that affect you though? It affects me because our sport is also the fans and the fans actually cultural who gets to fight and if a guy's going to talk to enough shit and so I were in flight suits then this day and age, that's good enough for a tighter shot and I think there's disrespectful to everybody that came before that.

Speaker 1:          01:04          Remember that you had to go tend to know. Then you get the fucking call from the UFC, give Connor want and low ball fund in the UFC and a 500 record he's going to be in the UFC. And I just, it's, it's ways that the sport is taking the love out of it, but I just find a way in dominated my opponents, taking all their tools away from them, you know, Dean Tom and shout out to them and Duke Roufus or fucking masterminds. So I take pride in that, take pride and going in there. They're not getting hit, um, dominated, knocking people out, whatever. When you say you don't like fighting, you like all those things you don't like to what other people are doing? I love training. I don't like what I don't like the split the sport has become,

Speaker 2:          01:45          so this is an interesting thing to talk about because a lot of people have different points of view on that. And one hand, a lot of people like the traditional martial arts approach of respect for your opponent and just fighting to the best of your abilities and letting the chips fall where they may. Whereas other people say, well listen, to get people to show up, to get asses in seats, to get paper view bys, there's gotta be some drama and some entertainment value to it. And that's where someone like Connor comes into Connor's the only one has done it though. Yeah. Well Rhonda a little bit.

Speaker 1:          02:15          Rhonda did it a little bit. Connor is done it the best. He actually puts in the work he a son in before he has a sunny day, but he didn't, he he his mouth, his mouth was louder and he's actually probably the best at it. He's, he's probably, he's better than Conor edit columns, very close. But Connor actually delivers on more than more of what he said he's going to do it in shell did. I would agree. So if you got to think of anybody who's brought both worlds together best, I would have to say Connor, he knocks a lot of guys. I would try to call the round, he's only lost a few fights total. And even though it's fights, it was RiskMatch war fighting the guy switched opponent. This node is different weight class. Um, you know, he's second those risks and rewards that if you lose, it's not really that big of a deal.

Speaker 1:          02:56          You know, nobody's going to really, oh my God dropping down to the bottom of the pack. But these other guys that haven't done it don't have the skills, ain't putting in the work. I mean it can kind of really just where you see the trend, right? There is a trend right now at least though, incredibly disrespectful, very rude. And you know, you saw what happened with Colby Covington and you know, at least be good at Marangu. You know what I mean? Daddy pressing charges. I mean that is a Queef. Well this coward Queef Clinton. There's a lot of attention being placed on him though. I mean you, let me see. It's nicely effective. Let me see how much attention is being placed in mind. It is effective in the moment, right? I mean don't want to go back to this stuff. It's effective in a moment. I'm going to tell you why because um, sometimes that's sometime I sports is like, you know, nothing going on.

Speaker 1:          03:46          It was like fuck with this is talking shit. Let me listen to him. And right there at that point kind of was around, Rhonda wasn't around. I wasn't around who is UFC really projected as a star? Sage Northcutt had a few bumps. Paige vanzant had a few bumps. They tried to push up and Ghana. But what started to have, so if you've got this person that's willing to go crazy, even though we know it's WWE, the person is really not getting slammed. We want to live in that moment anyway. We want to go for the villain. Who has he really beat behind Damien Maia? Well, what was the other top 15 victory? Well, the Damien Maia was a big one, but that was a big one. But he was one, but he was unmotivated and he was a guy that already had his title shots and you know, he's getting up there in age.

Speaker 1:          04:25          What is really his motivation? I wrote the book on how to beat Damien Maia and he didn't even read the book. He just skim through it because no part of the book said, let the Jujitsu guy to fuck you up and bloody your face cold. Because Cindy did that by himself. I didn't do that. You know, even with my right arm being messed up. So, um, yeah, he just, I'm just looking like how many followers just have, like, he didn't have a big following before that. That was his biggest fight. That was the big, the big coming. I don't want to this credit, I'm Damien Maia. Minimize a, Gee, you know, I don't want to discredit Colby, but you know, for you, for me, have some people in your resume have some, you know, I didn't be Derek. I mean Teryx Hafeni, Paul Daley, Jordan, me, and this is before I even got in the UFC.

Speaker 1:          05:10          My first fight was Jay Herron, who had only been stopped by George Saint Pierre lost one fight to be in action that was close and had won every fight after that. So I never had it easy fight. All my guys was either former champions or former contenders are former, you know, people that were interim champions and when you got a list like that, you should don't get the respect Koscheck Condon when he [inaudible] you don't get the respect from who if I caught them, oh my God can care less what they have to respect. You definitely get respect. Watch this. When you think of Robbie Lawler, Carlos Condit, right? Right. They're in a different category as it were to you that I'm the champion. I beat both of those guys. What do you mean by a different category? I th I see them in a category then this might just be me. I see them as in the category is if you're talking about guys who are going to enter the hall of fame, right? And you think about all Josh Koscheck and um, oh, Carlos condit and Robbie Lawler and you know this guy and Anderson Silva doll, all those different guys. But it's funny that I've defeated these guys, right?

Speaker 2:          06:15          You're crazy. You're talking crazy. I don't think so. No, you definitely talking crazy. You're the champ champ. You, you're acting like people don't respect you as the champ. They respect, they respect the people out. Carlos condit gets more respect or rather log. It's more, that's crazy.

Speaker 1:          06:32          Carlos condit gets more respected. Me. Robbie Lawler gets my respect to me. But from who though? Sure. Even guys, even guys that I defeated, like, you know, um, Stephen Thompson, he drops and they'll get more respect to me. I'm not gonna say that, but people are willing to be like, oh my God. You know, tell them Dana said, tell them to get in the cage with Tyrone Woodley. He didn't say, hey tire and tell them to get in. Case with Stephen Thompson on a seven fight win streak, knocking everybody fuck out with a really super word style that took me months in a fortune, bringing all these fucking crazy taekwondo, Raymond Daniels, all these, the best of the best to train him to beat him. Like nobody gave me that pass.

Speaker 2:          07:11          I don't know why you concentrate on that. I know that seems but you are because you're talking about it. I'm not concentrating on when he has these nutty thoughts. I'm telling him, telling me, I'm telling you this is all nonsense. This is a wasted, wasted energy. You think when you think about and that it doesn't matter to me because my path is pretty clear what I want to do. I want to do the best. I want to rent. I want to be the best waltz with defending undisputed UFC welterweight. We in 2007 when that was the shit. Now Shit is in the middle of wire. It's kind of middle of last quarter and they fight and supervise that are bigger than a world title fight because I know you as much you don't know you as much yet and whether whatever. Look, Connor is a weird enigma and whatever reason why that got caught fire the way he did.

Speaker 2:          07:57          It's a weird combination of personality, results, skill. It's a lot of, and Ireland, Ireland is a big factor. I mean, if Conner was from Nebraska, I guarantee you it's not just a big fight country. The loyalty and the love that those people have for the people that fight from Ireland. There's not no, there's nothing like that. It's, it's a, it's a weird anomaly, so he's just this weird aberration and he gives people almost like false hope of what's possible because I don't know if it's possible with a lot of people just, it just, it's lightening in a bottle for whatever reason. It worked with him, but he started it himself and then what happened? Her company jumper cables. Yeah. You'll see. Put the machine behind them. Right? They definitely put them in the machine. Behind him. There was giant hordes of people flying in from Ireland. I remember one of some of his earlier fights I was like, and I was commenting on and I was saying this is a guy who was on the undercard and they're acting like this is the main event, a paper view.

Speaker 1:          08:56          They've flown from Ireland. The audience is filled with thousands of people that flew from Ireland and now it has does. Even back then. It was insane when he fell, he know him back then. You know, it was funny, somebody while striking coach, she's like, Conor Mcgregor's is huge star and da Da da Da. I'm like, that's where he at first got into UFC and I'm like, I don't even know who the fuck is cute is he was telling, he was trying to convince me, no, he's a superstar, he's Dah, Dah, Dah. And then every time I get a chance I said, you were right. He wasn't dead. But there's more of a get ended up being a superstar and he loves to get their credit because at that moment I think I was getting ready to fight Doug and Kim and he kept home at this Conor McGregor.

Speaker 1:          09:35          So I said, let me look. This is my focus. Let me look them up because you obviously got a boner for this dude, and I looked him up. I'm like, all right, he's good. I get it, but let me see and beat a couple people and then if he can beat Dus, import, Yay. Then I'm going to give him his props. Knocking. Talk to us. Important doesn't pray. I said, all right, well, he's 100% legit. He's legit, but it's what else is going on? It's so weird. It's, he's not just legit. He's also this unbelievable personality that people are drawn to him. That's no one can manufacture that like he's, he's rehearsed it. He's practiced that. He's looked in the mirror, he has natural wit. He's, he's willing to go risky and say some below the bill shit, and he does his research. He don't come to a press conference, just you know, smoking.

Speaker 1:          10:19          You liked the front row of a comedy show. He looking into some deep shit and when you get there you kind of stumble. So you're right. He has that. He also has a fight style. He also has so happened to do 80% of shit he says going to do. So now he's the fucking Messiah. But you can't say that the UFC has not gotten behind you or people don't give you the respect that you deserve. That's why you are not in the same level as you said. You said that it, him and Connor are super fights. I'm saying that he has gotten it and I was saying that he has gotten it and he has lived up to what he said he's going to do. And then on top of that, you gotta, you gotta be able to fight. He can fight and he has been able to talk.

Speaker 1:          10:59          So now, not only Kinney, generate the paper, view bys and get people interested. He's actually going to deliver a knockout against Josie auto stop as it gets Eddie Alvarez. And the crazy, you know, back to back fights with when they did. Don't you think that you're in an unusual situation? First of all because you win the title by spectacular first round knockout against Robbie Lawler, right? Unbelievable knockout. But then you have the most awkward and difficult God to defend your title against Wonderboy. Thompson is a very unusual opponent and it's hard to look good against them and that'll all the people that fought him, you're the only guy that put him in danger. Not once but twice and the way you fought him. I've defended the way you fought him many times. Cause I say, look, if you look at tactically, if you look at technique and you look at the, the, the art of fighting, that's the way to find them. If you're a guy like Tyron Woodley, a powerful punch, it was a great wrestler.

Speaker 2:          11:54          Who's got one real one punch, knockout ability. You're not going to open yourself up to Wonderboy. Exactly. And don't get picked apart. You're not going to fight him the way he wants to fight would you did as you laid back a lot and people booed a lot because of that. But when you connected, you are the one that heard him in those two fights. He was the one that was in big trouble in both of those fights, not you.

Speaker 1:          12:18          Well, his fight was, it was, it was not for me. I'm never, um, you know, I got the same thing in the Maya fight, but at the end of the day, if someone's attempted to take you down multiple times, over 20 times, it's very hard to get in any type of change. Every time you swing, they want to go on and eat three shots.

Speaker 2:          12:33          Well, the Maya fight was tough too because your injury, but you got to go back and look at like Anderson Silva dark days. There was a dark days when Anderson Silva fought Damien Maia where nobody wants to have anything to do with them after that fight. And Anderson Silva fought. Um, when he fought there, there's, there's several fights where, um, he had just boring results and people weren't interested in him fighting anymore. One spectacular knockout and everybody's back

Speaker 1:          13:00          got it. It again. And then one spectacular knock out to get the belt and then everybody slowly forget about it moments later. Cause at the time Stephen Thompson said, Nah, where the fight Robbie and I think he's going to win anyway and that Ah, and then he think I'm supposed to be just so graciously like God that's fighting the honor. And the na you wanted to fight Robbie, right? You say rob, who's going to win? You say you personally prefer to write fight rob because I'd been waiting around even though that wasn't the case. So you said this, uh, so don't think that I'm just going to give you my spotlight and say, hey, you know what the others do this. No. If I'm seeing the table being set, I know there's Nate disease out there. Nikki is out there. George Saint Pierre is Michael Bay's means guys that have that name, they have that status that I'm trying to get to.

Speaker 1:          13:42          Those are the guys I wanna fight. I want to knock those guys now because now I can continue to intro myself up fighting him. Well, he's trying to get the same thing I'm trying to get. Why the hell am I going to pull you up with me if that's the fight? They wanted me to fight one on one. They never offered me to fight. He said something. Then I think the UFC thought I wouldn't take the fights. The first time they offered me the fight accepted it. So when all these people are like, oh my God, you don't want to fight trying to pick his fights, he's just got the belt. I'm like, Ooh man, you, it's not, I'm talking about

Speaker 2:          14:12          too many people saying things that you're responding to that are, that are irrelevant.

Speaker 1:          14:16          I think it's the two people that that are in the organization. I got to, you know, you're dealing with people that I don't deal with them in that regard, but as far as like people that are analysts and experts, as far as like the social media, like I really don't read social media. I post because I want to post and I'll leave it alone. So that's why I say that. I'm not saying without saying who it is. I'm not saying that the fans are making me feel some type of way. Cause my, my path is clear. I want to be the greatest welterweight of all time.

Speaker 3:          14:46          [inaudible].
