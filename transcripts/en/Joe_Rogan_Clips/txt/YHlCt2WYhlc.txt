Speaker 1:          00:00          And available right now. Everlast Whitey Ford House of Payne. You. Yes sir. How are you sir? How are you doing man? See your brothers. Because the minute you going to Vegas this weekend for the fights. Yeah man, we got a little party the night before. We were doing a little show at the Brooklyn Bowl with my buddy evidence and cell phones. You don't, the way I would put the headphones, I feel like I'm alone here with the headphones on it. There we go. Here we go. Now we're on the same team. Now we're locked in. Um, does this out? This is out right? Yeah, it came out about three weeks ago, something like that. Maybe a month. Beautiful. I've been in Europe for the home. Lunch is torn. So this is like everything Everlast presents Whitey Ford's house of pain. Yeah. It's, it's, you know, it's everything in the toolbox I brought to this record. So that's Kinda where the title came from.

Speaker 1:          00:44          Just, you know, it's been eight years since my last real studio album, so I figured, hey, maybe this could be the last one. I hope not. Buttons, just like I, you know, I mean like, you know, that my story is like, you know, with the family, I dedicate a lot more of my time to the family than I used, you know? Yeah. Um, just cause of some of the, you know, um, extra issues we deal with, which everything is wonderful and great. Now, you know, and dude, I'm 30 pounds lighter than the last time I was here. I honestly, it started here because I put, I purposely came here that day. It was the first time, if you remember, it just, it was wild garden and gun, a thousand podcasts since that day. But, uh, it was the first time I had come out and they started talking about anything like, you know, that was going on in my life in a public way.

Speaker 1:          01:29          And uh, you know, and I, I got a lot off my chest that day and I also planned that day to put myself in a position to hold myself accountable by this, by stating I, I don't feel good about the way I look right now. And I reached out for like, theoretically for help, you know, and I got an incredible response from the podcast audience and my own fans. I mean, I got offered from everybody everywhere how to do this, that and the other. Um, didn't really need that because within my own circle, some people stepped up and I also did it to hold myself accountable to put it in the universe. Like I've thrown it out there now. Like I, I put it up there on the wall and, and, and stamped it and said, here's what I want out of life right now. And you know, there's nobody stopping me but me and at sometimes some of the things I used to, I used to get on and see you talking about the, I'm not letting this inner bitch kicked my ass today.

Speaker 1:          02:20          And I just started taking things like that to heart, you know? And again, after you change, what did you do different that we started talking about it last time. Therapy, you know what I mean has helped a lot for me because of this, you know, the, the, the added pressures are family faces. With my oldest daughter having cystic fibrosis, you know, it just for a long time it was just learning how to live life with it, you know? And that got heavy. There was some real dark heavy moments, you know, scary moments for her in the hospital. You know, so we, I mean as a human or you know, you have this baby and you're just trying to figure out how to not screw it up with a normal health situation, you know, this is this thing. So it took a long time for me to come to terms.

Speaker 1:          03:02          At first I got really angry, I got into some real, you know, Lieutenant Dan war with God kind of stuff, you know, at the top of the sail boat flip, you know, as I was there all the way. And it got to a point where I almost, I was that I almost got locked up for trying to fight a cop that was, you know, trying to just talk to me about something, you know, and I just lost. I was, I had no, I had so much anger over so much that I wasn't dealing with. And then I found a guy that just really got me therapists and, and it, it began the, the, the, the ball rolling of understanding how to, how to cope with a lot of that stuff, you know? Wow. So, um, as far as like, first of all, you look really good.

Speaker 1:          03:42          They thanks, your face looks great, your skin looks good. I'm taking a lot better care of myself. It looks like it. Thank you. What are you doing different as far as like how you eat or, I'm just eating cleaner, you know, and just trying not to, you know, uh, to be more aware of what's in the food and listening to meet and stuff. You know, I'm still part of the whole commercial meat system though. I long to, to, to get it to a situation where I'm hunting and doing things like that. It's just, we had talked about that for a while. You want her to try hunting pigs to hone. Right. I asked you what would be the best starting point and you were like, you know, they got bore up there. Well to hone and I know some guys and, and I actually contacted them and I, you know, I just, again, this light so busy, it's not just this, it's the, it's the added stress of like, you know, I have a wife that when I go on the road, she's the sole handled her of these problems.

Speaker 1:          04:28          You know what I mean? And so that these things, you know, pile on you guilt and this, you know, stress and all this, you know? Yeah. And, um, so yeah, it's just between that and when I'm home, I just invest myself. I want to be home. I want to do as much as I can to lift that weight. So like I get caught up by the things, all the things I want to do, I can't do all the time, you know what I mean? But it started again. Now I'm taking care of myself. Like I'm actually just about to start Jujitsu again, you know, which I'm, yeah. Because I forever, I was so goddamn fat in the middle of the hip escapes where like, you know, every, I was hurting my back or my neck. Every other time I tried to do, I just quit because it was getting, you know, I mean, I mean I wasn't super advanced.

Speaker 1:          05:02          I was probably pretty close to getting a blue belt. You know, I was about a year in, on like four lessons a week with just the private, I was with mark as Vanessa said, Beverly Hills Jujitsu for awhile. So now I'm just looking to see what I want to do. You know, I've talked to Eddie a few times, I'm talking to a few other guys. Cron has thrown my way. Doing any exercise at all besides that cardio, not much weights or anything like that. Just, you know, keeping it moving. I two hours, two hours on stage tonight. Right. It's good to do something first. Uh, I feel like I always tell people like Jujitsu, so grueling that I think a why, I mean you could just jump in and you will get in shape through Jujitsu, but a good thing to do is like find a place that teaches you kettlebells and take some kettlebell classes and just, just get your body strong enough that it can.

Speaker 1:          05:53          I remember one of the things Marcus used to do brought Marcus used to run me around the gym for 30 minutes before we could even start a lesson. Like I literally had to Puke for the first like month. Yeah. That's that old school way a lot. And then it would take so long that he would be like, all right, you're past the puke and thing you ran and what I mean, but it was like, at first I would like literally be run till I was puke. And then the crazy part about it is this 15 minutes after you felt great when you were doing the last thing. So it was, and I'll work. Yeah, those, there's the old school guys, that's how they used to do it. They used to, um, like all the old school Carlson Gracie classes, you'd have a grueling physical workout, first hip escape, push ups, sit ups, body weight squats, all this different stuff.

Speaker 1:          06:33          There's a good thought process behind that. Not just that it gets you in shape, but also that you learn how to do Jiu Jitsu when you're tired so that you learn how to just use technique and not use like physical strength. You're almost having no choice but to relax. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a people that disagree with that though. They think you learn technique when you're fresh in it, like sits and better, but it's just two different schools of thought, you know? I don't think he either. One is right. It's definitely good to understand what it's like to be tired and how to, how to train and how to, how to push yourself when you're tired. Sure. Yeah. I'm excited. I'm really looking forward to it. Like I just started talking about it like about two weeks ago. Really getting back, well, that's a lot of weight to lose, man.

Speaker 1:          07:14          That's a big accomplishment. I've got 15 to go to really to hit my goal. Yeah. Hold it be to 25 to 25. Good weight. Yeah. Um, are you taking vitamins or supplements or anything along those lines? Like a daily, um, but I, you know, I have restrictions because I take blood thinners and stuff cause it's titanium heart valve I have, I have to have a vitamin that's devoid of a vitamin K because that's what makes your blood clot. So I like a lot of things like a lot of the juicing things and like things like that. When you want to go on a juice cleanse, I can't do it cause it's like a lot of it's Kale based and like Kale is a heavy green. Whether it's high in vitamin K it'll totally like screw up my blood chemistry, you know, cause I'm going the other direction with blood thinners.

Speaker 1:          07:55          Jesus Christ, I have to otherwise like a clock could hit like stick to that titanium valve, break off and wind up in my brain, you know what I mean? And then Tom stroked out and that's the last thing we need. Fuck yeah. I remember when you put the microphone up to your heart and you can hear that. Yeah. I would say I'm so, so like when I'm in here I've keep feeling like you can hear it anyway. It's like all through this, I hear it. 20 this white noise to me, if I want to hear it, I can hear, I can take my pulse like this just by telling you, wow. Two, three. You could feel it. I can hear it in my own skull. Like I could hear it in my bones, I can hear it. It's in me. How long is that good for ever?

Speaker 1:          08:29          Forever. Forever. As long as I take care of him. I was, I mean it's been 20 years. Literally in, in 2018 it happened. 90 or [inaudible] 98. Wow. And, um, I just get, you know, as long as I keep the thin, the blood thinners going and, and you know, that get checked in, you know, two times, three times a year, you know, and then the blood thinners it because if you got a clot it would somehow or another get stuck in that val clock could like, or, or you know, it's a titanium valves, the clock could actually form on it that the metal, like it could the book, if it's the blood's too sticky into co has too much clod, he could stick to the bow then break off and then wind up in your brain. Whoa. You know? So what does do avoid blood clots in general?

Speaker 1:          09:08          Yeah. What's the difference between that and the RECO regular valve? What would happen with a regular oven? The other choice would have been a pig valve and those are good for about 15 years. Like they usually open you up again? Yeah, I would have had to have it done. I'd probably be do. Yeah. I probably right now too, like I'd be like, go here I go. Yeah. Yeah. They do that for older people is what they do. Could like, you know, when you get into your sixties they, you know, really explore that because they don't think you're going to be around 50 more rice, you know, they just say, well here, just for now. Yeah, so it was called a saint Jude's St Jude's artificial valve. Powerful medical technology. Eddie Bravo has got a titanium disk in his back now. Yeah. He just had a surgery this right?

Speaker 1:          09:48          Yeah. His back moves around. Great. It like he was fully compressed whether it was like nothing left. It was basically bone on bone. He was in pain all the time and they just opened them up and put a fake valve in there. That's crazy. Were fake desk rather in there, but it's articulating so like moves around like a regular desk. Like he's his, it doesn't, it's not like he's fused. Even if you're seeing people that are off. I have a friend that got that down. Yeah, they're super stiff. Like wherever it is is basically locked down. There's no movement to it anymore, but Eddie's is actually, it moves like a real disk. It shit that's going to be coming down the pipeline. It's going to be crazy, man. Yeah. I mean, I know people with fake everything. I know people with fake hips and fake knees and what's fake? Heart valves. Heart valves. Yeah. Yeah. It's amazing. I mean.
