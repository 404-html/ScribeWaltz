Speaker 1:          00:00          Underlying cycle twenties let's think about you referred to the opioid crisis, for example. It's the cause. I think even a lot of really good people are profoundly misunderstanding what's happening with the opioid crisis. Where is the opiod crisis happening right into a lot of the epicenters of it, places like Monadnock in New Hampshire. Why is, why are things so disastrous there? Why is there much higher opioid addiction in West Virginia than on the Faculty of Harvard? Right? People in the Faculty of Harvard have much better access to opioids, right? Everyone there has good health insurance. They have much better access. What's going on that that some amazing economists, Angus Deaton and Ann Case did a massive study of this and they said that we need to understand the opioid deaths mainly is what they call deaths of despair, right? It's not a coincidence that the places were opioid addiction is highest, are also the places where suicide not with opioids is highest.

Speaker 1:          00:53          We're antidepressant prescriptions or highest, there's a whole, these things are clustering together for a reason, right, and you don't have to spend much time in those places to see people through. No fault of their own. Have I liked the rats in that first cage right there had been deprived of the things that make life meaningful. It doesn't mean chemical hooks don't play some role. They do play a role. But I've been to the places that have solved this and it wasn't by thinking primarily about that. So just talk about the reality, chemical hooks, if that's the right thing. It's very important to understand in relation to opioids. So it's a very strong agreement among scientists that the most powerful chemical hook we know is nicotine, right? You smoked cigarettes like my mother smokes seventies cigarettes a day. He smoked cigarettes. The thing you feel a physical craving for when you stop, which my mother would never do, is, um, is nicotine, right?

Speaker 1:          01:36          That's the chemical hook. Um, and so in the late eighties, when nicotine patches were invented, there's this huge wave of optimism among scientists because they're like, I write cigarette smoking is an addiction to the chemical hook. Nicotine. Now we can give people all the chemical hook they're addicted to without any of this shitty cancer causing smoke. People are gonna Start Smoking, right? Um, so nicotine patches are introduced in the US surgeon general's report a couple of days later, fines, highly motivated people using nicotine patches. Um, 17% of them will stop smoking right now. It's important to say that is not nothing, right? That means if you meet the Chemical Hook for people who are addicted to cigarettes, 17% of them will stop entirely. That's a big deal, right? That's saved a huge number of people's lives. But obviously 17% is not 100% that leaves 83%. The got to be explained by the other things.

Speaker 1:          02:33          And that's really the factors that I talked about in, in Las connections. So I mean there's a whole range of them, but you know, if you are acutely lonely, we are the loneliest society there's ever been, right? You are much more likely to be vulnerable to despair, depression, addiction. If you are controlled or humiliated at work, which most people now are to some degree, you're much more vulnerable to these things. There's a whole range of go through nine of these, these factors in the book. But to me, the most important thing in thinking about the opioid crisis, and I'm, I find it really frustrating that this is never discussed in the American debate, is I've been to the place that solves an opioid crisis that had a disastrous opioid crisis and ended it, right? And they did something that's very different. So Americans are being urged to do so I'm a Swiss citizen because my dad's from there.

Speaker 1:          03:16          So I Switzerland. Well, and by the time you get to the year 2000, Switzerland is having like an opioid nightmare, right? Um, people can look up videos from the time, but you know, people like Swiss people are obsessed with order is not a coincidence. They invented clocks that all that shit. Right? Like in their public parks, people like injecting in the neck like nightmare scenes, right? That'd be bad anywhere. But to Swiss people, this is like the worst nightmare, right? And they try all sorts of things. They tried the American way, arresting people, punishing people, shaming people and it just keeps getting worse and worse. And then one day they get this incredible woman called Ruth Dreifuss who I got to know later who becomes a minister of health and then the president, the first ever female president of Switzerland. Um, and she explains to people, I think the solution is to legalize heroin.

Speaker 1:          04:06          And she said, I know that sounds really shocking cause when you hear the word legalization, what you picture is anarchy and chaos. She said, what we have now is anarchy and chaos, right? We have unknown criminals selling unknown chemicals to unknown drug users all in the dark or filled with violence, disease and chaos legalization. She explained as the way we restore order to this madness, right? So the way it works isn't, uh, I spent a lot of time in these places and obviously no, or maybe there's some really hardcore libertarians, but almost no one believes we should legalize heroin the way alcohol or cannabis illegal, right? No one thinks there should be a heroine, Ireland's CBS. That's not the plan. Right. What do you mean Switzerland is if you had a heroin problem, you were assigned to a clinic. I went, spent a lot of time in the one in Geneva, the former president, Ruth dreifuss lives opposite this clinic.

Speaker 1:          04:54          I think that tells you something, um, lives across the street, across the street. What, what, what? It's the way it works is she should move well, but if you see the clinic that day, why? Right? So the way it works is you have to go to the clinic at seven o'clock in the morning because Swiss people believe in doing things really fucking early. It's constant disagree. What? Between me and my dad, you turn up, you go in, they give you your hair in there, they give you medically pure heroin. You can't take it out with you. You've got to use it there partly because they don't want you to sell it on. But mainly because they want to monitor you to make sure you know you don't overdose. Um, you use it there and then you leave to go to your job because you're given a load to support, to get housing work and therapy to figure out why you can't bear to be present in your life.

Speaker 1:          05:41          Right? So it's really important. They give two things. There's puts, bear in mind these two things because the opposite of what we're doing at the moment here, give them the safest possible version of the drug and give them massive amounts of help to deal with the reasons why they need that drug. You, they're giving them a drug, are they injecting it in them? Yeah, they know they, the individual injects himself or herself. So if you, if you were the patient, I'm the nurse, I give you the heroin and I give you a clean syringe. And one of the things that really surprise me, I at first I found really weird is they will give you any dose of heroin that you want apart from one that will kill you. And there is never any pressure to cut back. And yeah, I went there when it was 13 years after this at first started and there was almost nobody on the program.

Speaker 1:          06:21          Um, from the start there were like three people who've been there the whole time. Almost everyone does cut back and stop over time. And I remember saying to a Rita, Maggie, who's the chief psychiatrist there, well, how can that be? Cause we're told the chemical hooks take you over. You need more and more. If you had an unlimited supply, you would just carry on forever. What, how could, how could, how do you explain this? And she looked at me like I was dumb and she said, well, we help them in their lives get better. And as your life gets better, you don't want to be anesthetized so much, which ones that's explained to you is so obvious. Right? But, and it's worth just explaining the results of the Swiss program in the Phillies 15 years. Now in the 15 years since this began, according to the best scientific evidence be like Professor Ambrose, Austin Haagen have shown that had been zero deaths, overdose deaths on legal heroin, not one person.

Speaker 1:          07:16          There's been a massive fall in overdose deaths outside the legal program cause people transfer in because why would you carry on using expensive shitty street drugs when you could be getting, you know, help and given the drug for free. Um, and once it was fascinating about this is Swiss people are really conservative, right? My Swiss relatives make Donald Trump look like Oprah. And yet Swiss people after this had been in practice for five years, had a referendum on whether to get rid of it. And 70% of Swiss people voted to keep her in legal. Not Cause they're so compassionate. To be honest. That's not, they're not, they're really not a, it was cause crime fell so much. Right? It's much cheaper to give some crime fall. I've got the statistics in the book. It's fear since I wrote it, but there was, I think something like a 50% fall in street street, crime, street prostitution literally ended, right?

Speaker 1:          08:02          There was no street prostitution after that. Turns out women, you know, don't want to be on the street being fucked by random strangers, but about a, if they've got like an alternative, who knew? But the, um, so it was an enormous fallen crime across the board. And the police confirmed that. Everyone agrees with that in Switzerland and all the kind of anarchy in the streets just, just stopped. Right. But, but what the reason I think is really relevant to the opioid crisis is what we're doing is the exact opposite, right? So they give them the safe version of the drug, give them help to figure out why. Practical support to change their environment to get out of the isolet occasion into a life that's more like rat park. What do we do if you're a doctor in this country, finds out that you are using say Percocet or Oxy, not because you've got back pain, but because you've got an addiction.

Speaker 1:          08:46          Your doctor by law has to cut you off, right? They don't. They can be busted as a dealer. It's happened to lots of doctors and so they have to cut you off. So instead of giving you the drug, we stopped you getting the drug. Most people then, or not most, a very large number then transfer to much more dangerous street drugs like heroin. Secondly, far from giving you how to turn your life around. We give you a criminal record. We shame you, we stigmatize you. We put barriers between you and reconnecting. The opposite of addiction is connection. But what do we do? We put barriers between people and reconnecting. This is why that's one part of it, right? So there's the drug policy part of it, uh, where we're doing exactly the opposite of the country that succeeded in ending it's opiod epidemic. But there's something, I think there's even deeper than that, which you really see in places like West Virginia, Monadnock, the kind of hearts of the opioid crisis, which is we're also creating a society that's becoming harder and harder for people to be present in, especially in those, in those places.

Speaker 1:          09:44          There's an analogy I keep thinking of in the, in the 18th century in Britain, loads of people were driven out of the countryside into these disgusting urban slums in like a London and Manchester and something happened that has been well documented. There was sun called the gin craze, right? Where basically shit, loads of people just became alcoholics drank again until they died. Right? There's a famous painting from the time called Gin Lane of a mother down in like a bottle of vodka while a baby like falls out the window. Right. And things like that really were happening. If you look at what people said at the time, very similar to what they're saying now, they said, look at this evil drug gin. Look what it's fucking done to us. If only we could get rid of this evil drug gin, this problem would go away. Right?

Speaker 1:          10:30          We know now when we look back at the gin craze, it can have been Jenn that caused it because anyone in Britain who's over the age of 18 can go and buy gin. Right? And while we still have some alcoholics to be sure we don't have massive epidemics of our college and we don't have babies falling out of windows, what changed wasn't the amount of availability. It wasn't the availability of the drug. The drug is more available now than it was then. What changed was the amount of pain and distress in the society, right? We don't have a study we've brought as profoundly disorientated. I mean it's going up because we're creating more disorientation. So if you create a society where peoples basic psychological needs are not met right, where they have shrinking number of friends and social connections, where they're taught that life is about money and buying shit and displaying it on Instagram, excuse me, where they spend most of their time at jobs, they find unfulfilling, controlling and humiliating.

Speaker 1:          11:23          You can, uh, create growing pools of people who can't. And you, by the way, that if you're constantly insecure, financially insecure, half of all Americans through no fault of their own, have been able to set aside $500 for if an emergency comes along, she credits pervasive insecurity in the society. You're going to create very large numbers of people who are going to want to fill a need to anesthetize themselves. Now, that's not a good solution. Obviously I don't think heroin opioids, these are not good solutions to these problems, but, but it's not a crazy solution either. There's a line I think of all the time. I don't quite hit very often cause people can really react against this insight. But I think it's actually important. You know Marianne Faithfull, the great like sixties British singer. She went out with Mick Jagger. Annoyingly, that's why people remember. She's much better than Mick Jagger.

Speaker 1:          12:11          In her memoir, she shot heroin addiction in 60 she was homeless for a while. She has this very challenging line that I think about a lot. I'm going to phrase it slightly wrong, but she said, um, heroin saved my life because if it wasn't the heroin, I would have killed myself at that point. Right now Marianne Faithfull, if not saying heroin was a good solution to homelessness, but we'd got to understand this drug use is happening because it performs a function, right? One of the most important things I'll done for both of my books for chasing scream and lost connection is that these forms of despair, depression, anxiety, addiction, they are meaningful signals, right? They are telling us something. The fact that they had been rising year after year after year, that we're now at the point where average white male life expectancy has fallen in this country for the first time in the entire piece time history of the United States.

Speaker 1:          13:00          That is a signal that is telling us something. And that's because of drug addiction and overwhelming cause of drug addiction and suicide is, it's risen to that point. Are there other factors going on like obesity, but that the main drivers are a overdose and suicide and pat, he's telling us something of what we've been doing up to now is we've been insulting that signal. We've either been saying depressed people, addicted people are just weak or we've been saying, oh, it's just a problem in their brain that there are real things going on in their brains of course. Um, or we've been saying, you know, it's just craziness. But in fact it is largely a response to the way we're living in. Of course there are other things going on as well and we can talk about them. And once you understand that, you realize there's gotta be a deeper response.

Speaker 1:          13:44          And I went to places that had done it, not just Switzerland, Switzerland. What is the overall population? Five and a half million. So it's a small comparatively small country. Yeah. How much money do they have to spend to keep this program going? And what is the time constraints in terms of like how long has a, a person who's got an addiction problem allowed to stay there and, and receive treatment? There's no time constraint. You can stay on your entire life if you want to. In practice that doesn't happen very, they stay in the facility. No, no. They live in apartments and they just visit. They just go every day or whenever they want to. I mean, I think you can go twice a day and it's free. It's free. It doesn't cost anything. I mean, some people, once they have jobs, then pay health insurance and the health insurance pays for it.

Speaker 1:          14:26          But if you don't have money than they pay for it. Um, and one things that was fascinating as they found it, it wasn't, and Joanne set, uh, did good research on or sites could research on this for she to researched the open society foundation. It's actually cheaper than the police constantly harassing people, putting them in prison, putting them on trial. Those are really expensive things to do. Heroin is unbelievably cheap if you buy it legally. Right. Why would they do the amount of money they would save just in street crime being radically reduced. Exactly. It makes it, makes the life of the person with addiction better. It makes the lives of ordinary of other citizens who would not addictive better. Um, and it saves money. Right. Which is why Swiss people are very pragmatic. They're not, you know, the most compassionate people, but they are very pragmatic people.

Speaker 1:          15:11          That's why it was so popular system. Let's think about another place that adopted really different drug policies. Right? Um, cause I think it's something we can learn from there as well. So Portugal around the time Switzerland's having it's horrific heroin crisis, Portugal is having a fucking nightmare. Right? By the year, 2000, 1% of the population was addicted to heroin, which is incredible. Right? And every year they would like Swiss, then they were trying the American way, shame, punishment, stigma and things just kept getting worse and worse and worse. And then one day the prime minister and the leader of the opposition got together. And the louder, we can't go on like this. What are we going to, what are we going to do? And they decided to do something really radical, something no one had done since the drug war began in this country 70 years before.

Speaker 1:          15:54          They said, should we like awesome scientists, what the best thing to do would be. So they set up a panel of scientists and doctors led by an amazing man. I got to know him, Portugal, Dr. Wow. Pulau it could totally extraordinary person. Um, and uh, who'd run the first of a drug treatment center in Portugal, founded after the dictatorship. And they said to them, you guys just go away, look all the evidence and figure out what the hell we can do. So they go away for two years. They, they learn about rat park, they learned loads of things and they come back and they say, okay, solution is we want to decriminalize all drugs from cannabis to crack. But, and this is the crucial next step. Take all the money we currently spend on fucking people up, arresting them, shaming them, imprisoning them, and spend all that money instead on turning their lives around.

Speaker 1:          16:42          And interestingly, it's not really what we think of as drug treatment here in the United States, right? So they do some residential rehab that has some value. Main thing they did was a big program of job creation for people with addiction problems saying he used to be a mechanic, they go to a garage and they said, if you employ this guy for a year, we'll pay half his wages again, much cheaper than sending him to prison. Right? Uh, they set up a big program of small loans, so people with addiction problems could set up and run businesses. The things that they thought were important at the time. People like this is crazy. They're just going to spend it all on drugs. Lunacy. Right? By the time I went to Portugal, it was again, a 13 years since is gone and the results were in addiction was down by 50% over.

Speaker 1:          17:22          This is by the biggest from the British journal of Criminology. The best scientific study of this overdose deaths were massively down. HIV was massively down. Every single indicator on problems related to drug use had fallen like a cliff. Right? It wasn't perfect. There's still got problems of course, but there was a massive improvement. And one of the reasons you know it works so well is that virtually no one in Portugal wants to go. But I went and interviewed a great guy called Cryo for Guerra, who at the time of the decriminalization was the top drug cop in the whole country. And he said, what I'm sure Lozier your listeners are thinking right at the time, which was like, if we decriminalize all drugs, we can have an explosion in drug use. We can have lots of kids, these interesting nightmare. We can't do this. When I went to see him, uh, the audios on the Tyson's screen website, he said, uh, sang, like everything I said would happen, didn't happen, and everything the other side said would happen.

Speaker 1:          18:13          Did. And he talks about how he felt really ashamed that it's been so many years prior to the decriminalization screwing people's lives up when it could have been helping them turn their lives around. And, and this is something that I saw all over the world, right? The places that have drug policies based on shame. And stigma and the fantasy that you can get rid of drug use, which you can never do. Um, they have mass really terrible and rising problems. The places that have policies based on, okay, let's restore order to the market and let's give love liberty to drug users and love and compassion and practical help for people with addiction problems have declining drug problems, right? Again, not perfect, but it was such a significant improvement that support in Portugal. I mean, they've got five main political parties and none of them want to go back, right?

Speaker 1:          18:59          That tells you something, right? Yeah. Now when they did this in Switzerland, what was the primary cause for this drug addiction and how did they deal with that? So if they dealt with it in Portugal with these loans and, and, and, and helping our businesses by paying for half the salary and all those things like that seemed like wonderful ideas. What do they do in Switzerland to sort of mitigate what are the issues, whatever the issues were that were causing people to be drug addicts in the first place. So it's a combination. They gave people lots of therapy. So I remember one of the people I spent some time within that clinic had been, um, terribly sexually abused as a lot of evidence that giving survivors of sexual abuse safe places in which they can release their shame about that leads to a big fall in depression, addiction and other problems.

Speaker 1:          19:42          It's a lot of evidence that that, that kind of abuse is, is, is a big driver of a lot of addiction for a lot of people that clearly not everyone. Um, some of it was just, there were people who had never been given a chance in life or I had never had stable lives. Uh, it was kind of a mixture of things. And one of the things that's really good about this system is it wasn't saying in this kind of cookie cutter way, the up and half often happens in drug treatment in the United States are there, there's plenty of good examples as well. You know, you don't arrive and they say, this is your problem. We're here to tell you your problem and how to solve your problem. It's very much guided by actually the person themselves, right? People who are in deep pain. The, the, the core of it is you have to listen to them, right?

Speaker 1:          20:22          If we think about this addiction, depression in the way that I'm arguing, that we should see them as signals that are telling us something, most important thing is to listen to the signal, right? I remember saying, I thought about a lot, this weird experience that I kept thinking about all the time. I was writing my book, lost connections about depression. And I started quite late, late in the day that I realized why I kept thinking about it so much. I was in Vietnam about five years ago now, maybe a little bit less. Um, and I did this really stupid thing. I was, uh, I was in Hanoi and I was really tired. I was do research for different book that haven't finished yet. And uh, by the side of the road, I saw this big red apple or women selling it and I'm shit haggling. So I paid like $5 for this apple or something out and I took it back to my hotel.

Speaker 1:          21:05          I was so tired. I lay on the bed and I start eating it and it was just gross. Right? There were some really, it's chemical taste. It was like how I imagined a food would taste after a nuclear war when I used to watch these films in the 80s right. Um, but I was so tired, even though I knew it was wrong, I ate like half of it and threw it in the garbage and next like four days I was just like violently sick right there. Like just in like something from the exorcist. It's online there in front of CNN and occasionally projectile vomiting and it gets like bought it. I'd had food poisoning before. I basically lived on fried chicken in my twenties so I was not new to this Rodeo and after about four days, I said to Hawaiian, my, a fixer and translator who was a ranger.

Speaker 1:          21:46          I was there to interview survivors of the war, the Vietnam War for something. I'm like, look, I'm only here for another three days, or whatever it was. I've got to go and meet these people. Otherwise this whole trip would have been a waste of time. So he drives me like six or seven hours into the countryside and we get there and he's lined up these people for me to interview and I'm like, oh, thank God, I don't feel so bad. Actually I was sitting in this hot word, this, this woman who's an 86 year old woman who was the only person from her village that survived the Vietnam War. So I'm talking to her and now she's speaking that the room starts to, I've never had this feeling before, and I've had a thing when you were drunk, when you fill the rooms, move it.

Speaker 1:          22:18          It literally felt like the room was moving around me, like, like I didn't feel like I was disorientated. And then while she's talking, I just like explode all over her heart from both ads, like fucking horror show. Right? And so I say to her, I'm just, just take me back, put me in the car, take me back to Hanoi. Right? And he's this old woman's like sang, sang to him and I'm just like, line there. And he says, she says, you've got to go to the hospital. We were really sick. And I'm like, no, no, I just need to go back to the hotel. And he said, Yo man, this is the only woman who survived the Vietnam War in this village. I'm going to listen to her health advice over yours. We're going to the hospital. So we go to this hospital were, I'm pretty sure I was there in the European and I've been treated, they take me in and cranks like completely lying, going like this is an important western eye.

Speaker 1:          23:01          It will disgrace Vietnam if he dies there. Right. And so I'm lying there and they're like jabbing me with everything and I'm like, what's going on? And they're asking me lots of questions and I felt the most nauseas I've ever felt right. And I kept saying to them, give me something for the nausea, three quant, because they didn't speak English. And the doctor said to me, you need your nausea. It will tell us what's wrong with you right now. Even line there were thinking, it was kind of interesting. I was where we think of there and thinking, they figured out it was the apple and I'm having such a ridiculous thought where I thought, I come about to die, right? I've been killed by an apple. I'm like eve or like snow white or like Alan Turing. And then I was like, you're about to die in your last thought is that you're basically pretentious con [inaudible] that horrified by myself.

Speaker 1:          23:48          Anyway, they gave me this treatment and a few days later when I leave, I'm talking to the doctor and just discussing various things with him. And I said to him, what would have happened if I'd, um, if I had gone back to Hanoi, if it shouldn't be about 10 away. And he said, oh, well what happened is my kidneys has stopped working because I hadn't kept any water in for four days. So it was like I had been in the desert for four days and the doctor said, Oh, you would have died on the journey when it made it. And so can think about this experience, which really didn't actually affect my life. Well, viewer and a thing. It's the closest I've ever had to a near death experience. But all through research in my book about depression, lost connections, I kept thinking about this thing, right? You need your nausea, it will tell us what's wrong with you.

Speaker 1:          24:25          And I realized all the time I had been depressed for think about my relatives and people I love who'd had addiction problems. I had seen that my depression, their addiction as a bit like that. Nausea, right? As like a kind of malfunction, right? It's saying that you should get rid of. And actually what we need to do is hear it right? Cause it will tell us what's wrong with us. Right? It doesn't mean it's a good feeling. It's awful. Right? Depression is worse than I've ever felt. Uh, addiction is a terrible state to be in. It's not saying just in some kind of way, oh we need to put up with it. It's that if we hear the signal, we can begin to find solutions and all the places I went, the places that have solved depression crisis that I went to Veloce connections, places that have solved addiction crises, that w that I went to for chasing the screen are places that have said, actually, this means something, right? Your pain makes sense.
