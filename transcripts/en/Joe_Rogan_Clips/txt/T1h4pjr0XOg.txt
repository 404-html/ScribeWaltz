You heard about that New York, a bill that they're trying to have some big shit. It's like it's like a city, but we're still golf tees. They're giving a bunch of God damn fucking organ harvesting doctors control outside of law. You heard that piece of Shit fucking KKK guy fucking governor say we're going to keep alive after they're fucking bored. He's like, cause they want to fucking take their organs. It's incredible. He's a KKK guy. That's a quote above cold fudge. It's so incredible. Then I did a picture with a guy, the KKK outfit in blackface. They elected him because he's black males. They had that shit and when he messed up and said we keep them alive to get their fucking organs. They used that to deactivate him. Why do you think fraternities have you screw sheep and all this and you know give guys blowjobs that's why I never joined them because they want to come back. Go back, go back.
