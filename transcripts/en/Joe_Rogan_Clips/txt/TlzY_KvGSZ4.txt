Speaker 1:          00:00          This is something that everyone contemplates, like what makes you conscious? What is the soul? Is that a real thing? What is, what is your consciousness? Is it's simply just your own biology trying to calculate your environment and looking out for its best interests and trying to procreate and move forward with the, the genes that had has, or is it something almost mystical or far more complicated? Maybe even instead of the word mystical might be tainted, maybe something far more complex than we're currently able to understand. I think to some extent I would he agree to it because it's suddenly different. I need to have some internal perception of the external world and, and be able to think abstractly and all these things. It's surely different from way a baseball runs through the air and what makes it spin and and different than every other conscious animal.

Speaker 1:          00:53          I'm not so sure about that. So I think the difference isn't that big real. I mean, okay, we, you know, we use language to a degree. I mean some animals use language to some kind of degree. There's a huge difference in degree. I'd agree with that. But whether it's a difference in kind, I'm not at all. Sure. Um, you know, you watch these nature movies and I remember seeing one about elephants and this was about how the elephants were, there was a, there were always led by a female elephant, and that's not relevant to the story, but they were trying to go from a to B, I don't know maybe what it was. And they, there's a whole herd of them then we doing that. But then at a certain point they made a detour and they went off to a place where the leader of the elephant herd, her sister had died.

Speaker 1:          01:43          And the, the bones tusks, I suppose with their bones. Anyway, we're there and the elephants pick them up, handed them around and, and seem to caress them and move them around. And then they went back and joined to the, the route that they were. Now what does that tell us? There's something going on, which is not just some machine behaving like a robot. There's some, some feelings there that we can appreciate. I mean, another one I remember was one with these, uh, hunt African hunting dogs and the dogs you see there, there's a route where some antelopes we tend to go net to go across the river. And when they got to the point where the crossfit and that slow down and, and make their way to get across now these hunting dogs, you could see them, I think it was taken from the air and they would go along towards this place where the river was and then they would break into two.

Speaker 1:          02:37          So half of them would go one way towards the, and they will hide just where the river starts and the other half would go and chase the antelopes. They'd gone back and make an awful noise chasing them right there. And then the other ones were pants on them. I mean there's something there, which is, you know, there'd been working it out between themselves. How to do as commute communication of some kind. Yes. And I think there is, what would you call understanding. Okay. It's a more primitive level and then human understanding. But nevertheless, there was something, there's no sort of clean dividing line in my view. It's, it's, it's pretty continuous. Yeah. And this exists in wolves as well, so very, very similar behavior and they do seem to have not just verbal but nonverbal communication. They seemed to have some understanding of what the task is and what their roles are in the task.

Speaker 1:          03:30          And even though there's not as many variables maybe as human life there, there definitely seems to be a conscious awareness of, first of all, their, their position in the hierarchy of the tribe of the pack reminiscing, but also their, what their objective is this, this is not a selfish objective. It's a group objective and they operate as a group and they do move like those African dogs you were talking about. Yeah, no, it's fascinating. Love. Yeah. And there's a lot of indication that uh, my certainty, chimps and elephants and things and dolphins, we know about them, but I imagine it guys quiet file down. I should think. How much have you studied a Octopi? They're fascinating. Yes. No I haven't. There's a new book about them, which I haven't gotten the chance to read yet. I wanted to read it. I think they're, they're highly intelligent.

Speaker 1:          04:20          Yes, yes. Yeah. I've only different really paying attention to them for a few years. I have a good friend. My Friend Remy Warren was doing a television show, um, called Apex Predator. We studied the way different animals hunted and he started studying the way octopus and um, uh, cuddle fish and all these different, yeah, different, uh, Octopi and w the way they could adapt to their environment by changing their actual, they'll not just the look, but the texture of their skin instantaneously and how this is not really understood how the, not only how they do it, but how they know what they're, what's below them, what they're copying. Yes. That they somehow or another can figure out how to blend in almost perfectly with their environment. It's amazing, isn't it? They also can open jars and Lincoln climb out of tanks. There was one guy had a, he had a camera on his tank because he had two tanks and one of them had very expensive tropical fish.

Speaker 1:          05:20          And the other one had his octopus and he was trying to figure out what was happening to his expensive tropical fish. We put a camera on it and the octopus was climbing out of the tank, walking across the ground, climbing into the other tank, killing one of the fish, eating it, and then going back into his tank. Yes. Yeah, that's heavy. Well, there's one I saw, but I think I heard the description or I read it. I think I read it about some experiments on testing the intelligence of octopuses though, and they had a digital thing. They had to pull the chain and then open the door and getting food out, and this octopus was thinking, damn, I'm going to fed out with this thing and say, Yank the chain. It came right off and then it rose to the top and started squirting all the people in their white coats. So I know that was pretty good. You know, there's something else going on than just there is something going on. Absolutely.
