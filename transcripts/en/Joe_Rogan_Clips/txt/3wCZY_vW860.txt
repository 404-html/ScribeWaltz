Speaker 1:          00:00          Who was your grade? Because I had Tyson to there, you know, he was, he became one of them. And um, I remember it was funny because when I would put it down, like I said, everyone lied about to experience, but you know, they lied about everything. But I would put down, uh, you know, the, the age and everything else, all the stuff for what it was worth, you had to have something to try to believe in, right. And then figure it out from there. So Tyson, when I first had him, he was 190 pounds, not a bum. Also 12 years old. Okay. That's what it was. But that's what he was. I mean, that's what God made it so crazy. So I go down in, I put the first fight. Nobody's seen Tyson, nobody's ever seen tight. But at 12 years old, zero five. Okay. Hello Daddy. Now you go too far. You like more than us.

Speaker 1:          01:00          You learn a lot from us. I said, thanks. That's a compliment. I said, I think that Nelson, that's a compliment. I mean, I'd take a dyke as it is, right, right. I'm not lying. 12 years old, 190 pounds, please, please, please. Now. So I'm going to learning, okay. He's 12 years old. It's going to be 13 soon, but he's technically, he's 12 years older. Gay. Oh, come on. I said, all right, I'll make you feel better. I'll put down 70 [inaudible] now you tell the truth. I think that 17, but I knew what I had and know like cost side, I knew what I had. So I fought a 17 year old. I wasn't going to find no 12 year old. That wasn't going to happen. Right. And plus I get arrested for murder. So, oh, what was he like at 12 years old? Physically, mentally weak, but physically, what do I mean? Mentally weak. Not Weak for the average guy, but before fighter. Um,

Speaker 2:          02:01          okay.

Speaker 1:          02:01          He's still have remanence he still had residual,

Speaker 2:          02:07          okay.

Speaker 1:          02:09          Stuff from his upbringing. Listen, you are, know the truth about the guy. I mean he oldest, but he used to hide in between abandoned building walls in Brownsville is a rough place. No doubt about it. Didn't have a father, whatever, the mother, whatever. And, uh, he, he used to hide between walls to not get picked on. And I believe when you do that, you never get outside of that wall to a certain extent. You're always hide in a wall for the rest of your life as this is my belief that teddy, what are you talking about? It became heavyweight champ. Some people think it's the greatest. I'll bet

Speaker 1:          02:47          I don't have his record in front of me. And this is going to blow some people crazy, but what are you going to do? I don't have his record. Let's just say we're going to make an arbitrary number because your man's going to pull it up. But let's just say it's 50 and six. I would say five 15 five but whatever. I think his record is truly, if you're going to be this, and we're not truly in life with anything, but if we're truly, truly in an absolute world, which we don't live in, but I would say he's all in five high now. Everybody says everyone who is listening to you think he's just like, let me get with Teddy's drinking. Like, I don't see them drinking nothing, but he probably had some before he came in. To me, a fight is not a fight into this resistance to, there's something to overcome, something to overcome.

Speaker 1:          03:45          Otherwise it's just an athletic venture. It's an exhibition. I think life is that. I think the, you don't know of a lawyer is a lawyer into, into the some, the overcoming the courtroom. Something goes for, okay. I know he's a lawyer. I know he went to, I get it. Nobody has to tell me that, but he ain't a lawyer. He Ain't dad until everything goes wrong. The judge droves all this crap out and, and he's, he is aft, so to speak and, and he figured and he's still handles it. Then he's a lawyer. A doctor is not adopting to, he opens up this kid, a kid just like he's got it home and arteries are bleeding all over the place and it's not in a textbook. It's not in a fricken textbook. And he got to do it. He got to figure it out and he got, then he's a doctor then he's a surgeon at that level.

Speaker 1:          04:41          You, you're not, you are not in a fight. I, I, look, I admit it. I equate life to a fight. I do. You're not in a fight. And so there's pressure resistance overcoming something. Otherwise it's just an exhibition. Tyson's talent was so great. His physical ability, his talent was so overwhelming. Just like somebody intellect to some bodies, charisma, whatever beauty until it came to something else. But his talent was so superior that the other stuff never got tested. He was blown guys out and he had never got tested. If there was anything in the warehouse, so to speak, is there anything inside you never knew? And then five times, whatever the real record is, five times there was resistance. Five times it became a real fight. Five Times. There was something to overcome and he fell in all five times. He was only in firefights in his life and his own five, I'm sorry, sal graves, because we know my history with them. Right. Am I in my, am I capable of didactic Newman? Yeah. But I can honestly tell you

Speaker 1:          06:04          that I, I, I took, um, I try to be better than that, that, that I've, I've called many fights where the people in the call and I couldn't stand them. I had no respect for them. But if they, if they did a good drop in a corner of their Friday did job, I talked to about them, like they were Ray Arcel like they were Angelo Dundee because that's what it was supposed to be. That's all. And it's selfish because I don't want, I wanna have, I wanna know and I want my kids to know that I can be better than that. That, that it's, it's about, it's about the code of the profession. It's a, it's about you. It's about, you believe in that. Would you say is, should be honest. It should be what you believe. It shouldn't be tainted or, or, or influenced by lesser things that, that it does represent you.

Speaker 1:          07:00          It does represent your family. It does represent where you came from. It does stay. Do you know your blurted out for those five minutes or maybe two hours on ESPN, but it stays, someone can go back to it. You could go back to it. How do you feel about it? It does mean something. It really does it. And so I'm only saying it because I would say it about somebody else in a way that I calibrate things. The way that I evaluate things that I don't think that you know crap about somebody until they're tested. You don't know the friend, you don't know if they're good wife. You don't know if they're a good girlfriend, you don't know crap you think you'd do, but until they're really tested, you don't really know. And Tyson, when he got tested, when he had to overcome some, when, when he didn't run him over with like, like one of those big monster trucks running over Volkswagen because he was a monster truck pull Volkswagens. Yeah, he was. Yeah, he was. And was, he wanted the greatest punches all day? Yeah. Yes. Could he punch from either side of the plate like Mickey Mann or the greatest switch hitter? Was He that in by? Yes. Could he could punch evenly. Great with either hand. For me side. Was he all those things? Yes. Was he as great an intimidators Sonny Liston? Yes. Was he a great finisher like Joe Louis? To a certain extent, yes,

Speaker 1:          08:30          but he wasn't a great fighter because great fighters won. The fight came to them. They found a way to do what they had to do. He found a way to disappear. They found a way to show up. Yeah, show up. He found a way to go and not show up and look. You could go

Speaker 1:          08:56          talk to psychiatrists and you could go to for the reasons why the old hiding between a war when he was a kid. Yeah. That, that's part of it. I'll tell you another part of it. To be that, not to be the power puncher, not to be the aggressor, not to be. Just those things. To be, to tighten, to be the Viking, to be the Samurai, to be the warrior, to be those things. It has to be inside you. You have to believe in it all. A lot of times people lie in life. This is Fullerton plays, you can't lie.

Speaker 2:          09:33          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:34          You know, sometimes we'd say that the ring is a chamber of truth, you know, it sounds good and all that, but it does. It is because just like in other places in life too, when the moment comes for those kinds of serious things,

Speaker 1:          09:53          you have to feel like that. You say that you're the conqueror, you Alexander the Great, your all those things. Right. Okay. Word sounds great. Makes good soundbites. Probably bring more people to the TV, but when the moment comes and you didn't intimidate a guy that didn't work. Okay. We all try it to a certain extent. Right? Probably. Yeah. I'm sure you've looked at guys certain ways when you were younger and you'd purposely looked at them in a way to invoke a certain kind of action, a certain kind of result from them. Just just look at them in a real serious way that you hope that we can do. Yeah. And but because I know your background, you will prepare to do what came after that, but some people aren't. Some people aren't. And Tyson was in as great as he was. I just said it. He's great guys that hate me for [inaudible] today, your hero or whatever your favorite guy, when he's great, she's not great and in his area and when that moment comes you have to, that's where the truth matters.

Speaker 1:          11:07          You have to believe that you really, that guy and if your guy that he and he was convicted so I think it's fair that rape somebody. Okay now listen, I wasn't in that room and I don't know, a lot of people don't take okay but he was convicted or, but I know enough people in the business that there was a lot of other bad things that he did that it just not things that that you would probably want to hang around with somebody if you know, if you're a halfway decent human being that he did devil week things. Okay. Week thing. So when you do read things and you know you did though and I don't know what, but I'm just saying you do week things and you know they will week things and now you got to do a strong thing. How do you become strong when you know that you did those weak things and you know that's really you and you got a guy, a causeway from your name, Nevada Holyfield that doesn't give a shit about how hard you punch. Does it give a crap about what a finisher does? It give a crap about how fast you put your punches together. He wants to find, you're going to have to make him a believer by doing it and doing it in a difficult place because he's gonna make it difficult because he ain't gonna cooperate.

Speaker 1:          12:17          When that happens, you got to feel like that person. And when you don't feel like that person, you got a problem. And as what happened wasn't a matter when he bit his ear, it was a matter that he was hungry. It was a savage and who's was from the suit? Stop the crap. It was a way to get out because he knew he wasn't that guy. And when you're not that guy, guess what? You have a great talent off. Recognize when somebody is there as your greatest talent. He can recognize when somebody is, and he recognized that Evander Holyfield was and I was his way to get out.

Speaker 2:          13:03          Okay.

Speaker 1:          13:04          And he did. So that's why, again, it's not sour grapes. It's really not because I'm more selfish than that. I really do care about what my reputation is and whether or not, uh, I've been honest about things they say. It doesn't mean I'm right per means. I believe it. I do care about that. I do.

Speaker 2:          13:27          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          13:28          And so it's not, that doesn't mean I'm right, but it means I have a reason to believe on right from the way of live, from what I've seen, what I've experienced in the business, the human condition, how strong it can be and how we could can be. And, um, he was his strongest guy, if you ever going to see, but he was his weaker person as you ever going to find.

Speaker 1:          14:01          That's intense. But I see what you're saying in terms of you are judging it by the highest standards possible. You're judging it in comparison to other champions. You're judging it. You, you, you, what else you got to jump through with Joe. Of course. Well, you look at guys who are known for incredible heart and their ability to come back like Diego corrals, David Corral, sin, some of those wars when you would say, Whoa, we could steal. Yes. That was one of the greatest fights of all time. The forest of credible, greatest fight of all Micky ward. Arturo. Gary the first one, right? Not the second, third, the first, the first HUD believable. Unbelievable. I mean, no, if you want to go back, if you want to go back farther, lot of people will know this, but you should call him was involved in a lot and unfortunately he paid the price. Okay. Yes. But Bobby should it in the 70s, eighties he was involved in those fights every other day. Yeah, no, I'm just kidding. But he was invited to many of those fights. Yeah. And unfortunately you don't know about Bobby Chicago and you talk to somebody again, I'm going to like the baseball thing. You talk about the average guy, Bobby Chicago. Who the hell's that?

Speaker 1:          15:09          Who the hell is an unforeseen, is the guy that would know his name anymore. But, uh, he was a pretty special guy in that ring. He was pretty damn tough.

Speaker 2:          15:22          Tougher than most people.

Speaker 1:          15:25          There's guys that unfortunately relied on that toughness. Right? Yeah. Like when you, when it comes to guys known for incredible Chins, that can be a detriment. Yes. And it can be if that's all you have. Do you think that's what you have? Cause she used to put it this way cause she used to that because he wanted me to be a great trainer. So she used to always be with me, all the terms, you know, saying things and costs would say day two tough guys. Okay, Gotcha.

Speaker 2:          15:55          Now what's tough?

Speaker 1:          15:59          It's a prerequisite to being a fighter. You better be tough. But what Lovell. So all levels the greys and I got you. But how special is being tough? Because if you're a fighter you should be tough. I got Ya. Homelessness. So you got two tough guys,

Speaker 2:          16:18          but one of them is smart. Taught, developed. That's him.

Speaker 1:          16:29          He's tough one now. That's how he explained the tougher because he's smart. Yeah. Tough. Yeah. And smart. He, he goes from here, he's here because he's not just dependent only on toughness. So He's tougher than this guy. Right. Cause he don't have to depend on just that. Right. You might not even have to get to it. It's there as a reserve. It's always there to call on like an army. You call on, you need it. Right. But he's not dependent just on that. Isn't that the balanced though, is knowing that you have it. Yeah. Knowing that you have it and it's there. There it is. See what you just said. You have to know that you are it. Tyson didn't know he was it. We ever met that night. He probably knocked me and say, does it whatever. I don't. It's okay. And so I get I, it's okay.

Speaker 1:          17:17          Well there's certain people that you can't question and Aranda Holyfield's one of those people. That's why that fight was so fascinating because it was, Phil was, he is a 100% warrior. Well, he had to write nickname. Most of them don't. Most of them don't have the right fight nickname and whatever they do. But the real, the real deal, he was the real deal. Yeah. And you know why small heavyweights, you want to know why? I mean trace it back, cause always told me this but I learned it innately on my own too. But trace it back to the parents, trace it back to the background. Tracy trace it back to all that stuff. Trace it back. He did. He didn't live up to something. He didn't face something. He didn't do whatever was there was about, he had a mother that he talked about a few times and I, I'm sorry, event of, I'm not saying exact but, but it's, it's there.

Speaker 2:          18:09          Yeah

Speaker 1:          18:09          that and a great model obviously, but she, they had, or the grew up in Georgia tech goes Atlanta pub, whatever suburb of Georgia and she, you have definite age, you know, different time down south and all that. Had a little, I guess a little shack in the back with a thing called twitches switch. It switches. I'm sorry, I'm twitching switches. And she basically had different size switches, you know, short ones, long ones, medium ones depending on the occasion. And when he didn't live up to what he had to tell the truth, whatever, be accountable. Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:57          Face what he had to face, whatever. Um, she had a switch fam and you know what it um, informed him cause he faced things. Tyson, Tyson on the other hand and listen, did he ask for it and no, no. He didn't ask for that opinion. I get it. But I know people have that upbringing and they get to a point they can take and make a left turn instead of a right turn. Is your ability to make, don't you think there was also the, the overwhelming hype and celebrity involved in Mike Tyson in his prime? It was probably so difficult for him to even understand himself. Yeah. But, but what he did understand, and I'm glad you said that.

Speaker 2:          19:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          19:44          Right backwards. What he did and what he did understand

Speaker 1:          19:51          was there was a way out of Anda learn. There was no way out, you know, oppose away. You know what I mean? Right. Yeah. Like somebody would come and pay. Yeah. And he did a lot of things before he became champion and somebody was always there with a check or cash or whatever. And, and w would absolve them from, it would, would not have to face what he did. Right. And, and, but there was a switch that Amanda hat of his face and that's what made him what made him, and that's what allowed Tyson part of would move out. Tyson, you look, you make your own choice at a certain point life. So there's not make too many excuses, but it is part of it that, that he was formed by what he was allowed to do when he shouldn't have been allowed to do those things.

Speaker 1:          20:36          And that was one of the issues that you had with costs, right? Yeah. That you felt like costs was ignoring his own principles and teaching because this guy was so special. Yeah. And cause he was getting older and because recognize you didn't have much time left in this guy had a legitimate shot at being a world champion for cause heavy thing in his, you know, everything in the world of boxing success and everything. He was great. He was special because his whole life he didn't get married for a reason because he was married to box. And as he said that it wouldn't been fair. I mean this was a different guy that it was boxing his whole everything life was boxing and lessons were connected to boxing, everything and um, principals boxing and uh, so there's uh, you know, there's a guy that his whole, you know, you used that word legacy, but really his whole existence was boxing.

Speaker 1:          21:33          And for him it was heavyweight champs. He had Floyd Patterson, youngest heavyweight champ ever. That was cost. That was because it was about lightweights. Listen, he had lightweights. He had welterweights Jose Torres. Yeah, Jose towards light heavyweight champion. Exactly right. He had other guys too. But it was the heavyweight champion of the world because it was around where we talked about before when box was the biggest sport, bigger than baseball and it was the heavyweight champ of the world was Babe Ruth. It was rocky Marciano and that, and you're going to say that before you leave this earth that you have a chance to have another heavyweight champ to might be the best, could be one of the best ever and could break Patterson's record, which was part of the plan, part of the plan. When costs was alive, you're going to break Patterson's reg. He broke it. He became the youngest heavyweight champion. And so when you float that out there w if you will, and, and tempt the guy with that, even a great guy like cause some things are going to be pushed to the side and he did. Yeah, compromised and he did. Do you think if he didn't do that, the Tyson would have been a different person?

Speaker 1:          22:45          I'm going to use his words there was told to me by a great promoter. Mickey thought he passed away. He was close to Jim Jacobs who was close to cause and he was up there sometimes we have to. I left and all that and Mickey wanted me to train all those fighters and he was a great promoter. Mickey, he had great sayings. He was a very witty guy, but he was a sharp guy. Boxing was his life too. And he ran everything in London with three partners. One of them was Java to stay who owned Wembley Stadium. So they were powerful. They ran everything. They were the cartel in London back in those days. He told me that performed cost died that cause had said some nice things about teddy atlas, but he said and loads, I know there's a danger that this can be convenient. You know what I mean? Self serving crap. Sometimes you got to trust whatever. I was told by Mickey that he said that Teddy Atlas was right but was wrong, was who's going to get in the way of the possibility of making a great fighter.

Speaker 1:          24:03          Um, if he did things his way as far as the disciplining in the in or whatever. Um, eve, in other words, whether he left it like that, so I don't know. So I know what I think it meant that title wouldn't have been around if you did it, if you're disciplined, that he would have laughed. I don't know, cause I don't know that he had those options because he was a ward of the state and uh, you know, it was coming out of obviously a criminal situation who's coming out of a juvenile detention center called Trion up outside of old, 30 miles outside of Albany. Um, you know, so I don't know that he had, but basically that if teddy did it his way, he was right, but he was wrong because it would have ruined the possibility of a great fighter and I could let that happen.

Speaker 1:          24:51          So I don't think that it's, I don't know if it's true, actually. I don't know. You know what I was about to say? I don't think that's true because of course it's me. Right? I want to make myself feel good. So I want to say you could add the best of both worlds. So good. We had maybe a better person or within the realm of a better person. Right. Boundaries. Right. There were no boundaries. Maybe they would have those boundaries would have made a difference. Right. And you still would have had the town. It was so absent. The talent wasn't going to dissipate because I have to discipline, you know, that you put on them as a human being. That wasn't going to change. But because, because we're saying that it wasn't gonna happen. Maybe you'll lose them. Maybe it goes to someone else at a certain point in his development. Maybe that's what he meant. I Dunno.
