That he wrote down a thousand meter row and I'm like, what's a good time? So we looked up the top times. I'm like, I think I'm top 300 in the world right now. A bit, you know, I got to do some work. It was a big guy. There's big difference between top 300 in the top hundred. Yeah, but dude, you're top 300 in the world with a row. With a rail. Yeah, look it up. That's pretty fucking sweet. It's all right. I mean, it's a row machine on the top 85 million. I mean, no, you're the hold up. You're the, hold on, hold on. Let's just, I would that, that was the humble brag, but let's just be serious there. You're the, you're the hardest kicker ever on that Goddamn UFC machine. Well, I call it the Francis Machine.
