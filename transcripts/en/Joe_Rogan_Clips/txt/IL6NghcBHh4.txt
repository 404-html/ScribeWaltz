Speaker 1:          00:00          Um, so you, you go to this one destination, you a, you shoot this black Jack. Will you hooked immediately?

Speaker 2:          00:09          Yes. Really. It was not about his fishing part. Actually, I was still traumatized in the water. I still had panics attacks when I was in the water and um, but I fell in love to second. I arrived to shore and we barbecue the fish on a beach and I was like, okay, this is, this is for me.

Speaker 1:          00:28          That's the same exact thing that happened to me when I went deer hunting when we were, me and my friend Brian Cowen and Steve Rinella and Dan Dody were cooking this deer meat by a fire. And I was like, this is the greatest thing ever. This is, the meat was so fresh because it was like from an animal that was, you know, literally killed hours ago. And then we're eating it by, by the fire. I was like, this is, I'm going to do this forever. This is the greatest thing ever.

Speaker 2:          00:54          Primal, right? It is. It's you, you, you feel, you felt, what I was told people is that, you know, when you live in a big city, like when I've never experienced that before, I've never felt that I was part of the ecosystem whatsoever. Right? And then all of a sudden I've been putting myself into water when I'm surrounded by sharks are big fish or different things. And I'm like, wow, we're actually not in top of the food chain at all. There's a lot of stuff on above us. I can't kill us. And it's, it's, it's, it's caring. It's humbling. And I think as a person, you have to experience that. You have to, you have to put yourself out of your conference old to understand that you need to respect what's around you. You could tell me 10 years ago, ah, you have G. Dot. Fish because it's baffled DRM.

Speaker 2:          01:41          And I'd be like, yeah, yeah, sure buddy. Right? And then you see an airplane, you're like, Ooh, that looks good. Then it's fine and this. But then when you in a water and you see what's going on and you see the a spa, you've been diving for five years old, southern is empty, then it makes you understand that, you know, we actually have a very strong impact and it's, it's our job to, to understand and, and, and respect it. We're where we're at. Where did it go? System, which just the one that we're the smartest one. Sometimes

Speaker 1:          02:09          we're the only ones that are consciously aware of our actions and the repercussions. Yes. Our actions. What, when, when you're, you know, first experiencing this your first time, eat in this feeling of connectedness and freedom and just being a part of the ecosystem, did you imagine that some or know that this could be your life and your job?

Speaker 2:          02:33          Not at all. I've, I've, I've, I've never been hiking, I'm not a big fan of, I've never used to be a big fan of the outdoors. I'm, I've, I've, I don't go to the gym and exercise. I go to the gym, no, no, that basically don't eat anything. And then all of a sudden I was living in London and the Nice apartment with two dogs and a nice car and all of a sudden I was in fricking Africa being in a Bush, getting catching my own food and sharing would villages or had nothing eat. And it was like, okay, well this is,

Speaker 1:          03:01          how did that happen? Like how did you go from this one trip?

Speaker 2:          03:04          Um, I got invited to film a documentary and food sourcing and I was like, okay, I'm going to try it. And I fell in love with it and the second I went back to London, I remember sitting in my desk and be like, she, no way I can do that. There's no way I can keep doing that for rest of my life. And everybody taught, I was completely crazy. I sold everything I and I just left, I moved away and I, I have like maybe two suitcases of stuff for the past three years and

Speaker 1:          03:35          I was reading somewhere where they were going to do an interview on you and they decided not to. They're going to feature you in something with a decided not to because of concerns for the depletion of fish in the ocean, and I said, that is one of the dumbest fucking things I've ever heard because the impact of someone like you, what you're doing, you for your own personal consumption, taking a fish a day or whatever you're getting for your own personal consumption is negligible in comparison to all these people that are probably writing these articles that are going to buy Sushi from commercial fishermen. They're there, they're buying fish from the store that's wrapped in Saran wrap there and they're, they're completely out of touch. I don't mean your intouch, you're as in touch as you can get, but to think that somehow or another you're doing something evil because you take photos of it and put it on your Instagram. What was that one you had this amazing photo from a couple of days ago with you with is this big fish? It was so fresh and you, you guys were eating pieces of it. He had cut a chunk of out of the out of its tail.

Speaker 2:          04:40          Yes. That was in Thailand? Yeah, Paquette. Paquette actually, yeah. We'll just went with this friend of ours would his family, and we just went off for today and we went spearfishing when my phone would caught a fish and, and the guy was super happy. He cut it right on the spot and all the kids were just picking on it and it was, they were so excited. The second year he came, the second day came that the boat arrived back to the island. He just went and grabbed the fish and they were trying to take pictures. It was super cute.

Speaker 1:          05:06          What, what was the argument for not, what was the piece that they were trying to put you in where they pulled you out of it? What was that about?

Speaker 2:          05:12          Oh, that story is, it's still getting me pretty angry. She'll basically where I was speaking at a woman empowerment conference in New York last May. And then when I was actually in Thailand, the, the woman that is organizing it calls me and she's like, oh look Valentine. Like I need to talk to you about something. And it's, you know, it's a little touchy. I'm like, what? She's like, well, one of her sponsors said that if you speak at a conference thing, gonna withdraw their participation and the conference, what was the sponsor and the Wall Street Journal,

Speaker 1:          05:46          The Wall Street Journal.

Speaker 2:          05:48          And I'm like, and she said, yeah, do you feel like that's your lifestyle is in align with ocean preservation? And that's, and she said something, she didn't say it directly, but she said, and you know me, I don't mind that you have pictures and a beanie seat. I'm like, what do you mean should have my beanie? You, sorry, my Burkini was not clean. Like what do you want from [inaudible] beach? When am I supposed to wear swimming? I'm swimming, you know, wear your bathing suit. You mean

Speaker 1:          06:21          your high heels? You know, being an Insta model, you're wearing a bathing suit and there's nothing wrong with that either. But you're wearing a bathing suit because you're actually in the water.

Speaker 2:          06:30          Exactly. I'm not in Mykonos next year. Fricking pool. I'm in, I'm in, I'm in Africa on a beach when it's like 110 degrees, what am I supposed to Campbell's Arion. Exactly. Respect. So,

Speaker 1:          06:45          so I mean, what did you say to them? Well that's Wall Street Journal. That is so crazy. You know what? And I get it from their perspective, it's a bullshit argument. But from their perspective, it's just about optics. It's about how it looks. That's all it is. And if they go there and people love to get outraged about something and if they go there and then they go to your Instagram and they find pictures of you with fish, they're like, well this girl's cleaning out the ocean all by herself. She killing home. You would have to be really good. I mean, have you ever seen a commercial fishing boat? What they do? Yes. Yeah. Most people haven't. Jamie CV, you could pull off the horrific affects of commercial net fishing because, uh, if you find a video, we can watch a clip of the video. It's crazy when you see the sheer volume of fish that they pull out of the ocean.

Speaker 1:          07:38          And when you realize there's countless numbers of these boats and essentially pretty much unregulated and no one's watching them and they're doing it all over the world. I mean there's areas where you're not allowed to fish, but overall it's nothing like the way we treat wild mammals or wild birds. The way we treat wild mammals, especially in North America is they're very closely monitored. Their numbers, their populations. We make sure that it, unless it's an invasive species like wild pigs, I, here we go, this is, this is awful. They take this gigantic net, they circle all these fish and then when they're pulling them in, you get to see the sheer volume so you as they get close.

Speaker 2:          08:24          But that's, that's, that's one of the smoother way to commercial fish. Frances ready big on on trawlers and it's two kilometers wide net. That is actually, it's, it's scraping the bottom completely destroying every store in the coral. This is his shocks on each side.

Speaker 1:          08:42          This is actually a, a fairly mild one and it looks like they're getting these little tiny fish but me, you could find it folks if you wanted to go and Google it online, but that is the issue too, right? That these, these go all the way to the bottom and they destroy anything that they touch. Like the whole, the bottom of the ocean just gets dragged in. All the coral gets destroyed.

Speaker 2:          09:06          It's this extremely destructive, but it's what, what, that's how you get Sushi. There's so much the fish industry, it's not even necessarily how you get Sushi. It's how you get Sushi so damn cheap. Right? But it's, it's by Deloitte. If we keep doing that is literally going to be no fish very, very, very soon. But then how do you explain that? And Canada, you know, allowed to spearfish what and you have to release most of the fish. You run rail. There's a lot of your stories.

Speaker 1:          09:33          Most of the fish you rod and reel.

Speaker 2:          09:35          Yeah. In Canada. Like you'd like the stripers try Beth. And how many, how many can you get a day straight past like one a day or something like one a day. Spearfishing, one a day. And, and the US site and Canada. You not even in touch anything you want. Can't use spear phishing Canada because the Anglers Association in Canada, things that were to evil basically that you're evil. Why? Because you can actually see what you're catching. Yeah. So basically w where did cheaters, because we can see the fish and I'm like, how can you be a new camping chairs on your boat? Drinking Beers all day telling me that um, the cheater when I'm working my ass off diving at like 60 feet to catch my fish to bring it back. And I Rick, smile life. I was my life drowning and risk. My left would shark service my life would all sorts of things that can happen and you're telling me drinking you but wise when you fricking camping chair that I'm the cheater. I'm sorry, but no.

Speaker 1:          10:32          Well people always want to think that everybody else is doing it wrong. True. You know, vegans want to thank people that eat meat or doing it wrong. People that eat meat, one of the things, vegans are doing it wrong. People fish off a boat. Want to think that people spearfish, you're doing it wrong. You'd think they're probably doing it wrong.

Speaker 2:          10:49          No, I have nothing. Again, catching you on food as long as you, you know, respectful would, would do or you do it. But there was a big scandal in Florida for the past years with the red snapper by example. And it was about, um, like recursion recreational fishing. You allowed a certain amount of, of red snapper and then a season closes and then when a season closes as an individual, my license to fish is gone. And then he gave it away to the commercial fishermen and I'm like, whoa. So basically you telling me that I'm not allowed to catch that fish for a few months because of population is too bad. But then you given my quota to the commercial boats that are at catching hundreds a day. They like, yeah,

Speaker 1:          11:39          no, it doesn't make any sense. No, it doesn't. Then what? Most people are not going to spear fish. Most people are going to fish, so they don't, you guys don't have a voice, right. In terms of like representative voice comes to creating these laws and establishing these, these rules. There's not that many of you

Speaker 2:          11:58          and the food chain. We're the plankton is, you know, you had a commercial fishing would very big, uh, lobbyists, men, a lot of money. And then you have the Anglo or juices a little bit. It's still not super bad because it's still have big boats, company and equipment is still, I give the market which is good enough. Right. And then you had a spear fisherman, right? I'm spearfishing. Men's were not a lot in the world's eye. I couldn't even tell you how many, but we're not 100 million us for fricking sure.

Speaker 1:          12:25          It's probably less spear fisherman. Then there are bow hunters.

Speaker 3:          12:29          Okay.

Speaker 2:          12:30          That's highly possible.

Speaker 1:          12:31          Yeah, I would, I would imagine because it seems more dangerous and difficult than bow hunting. It seems like the next level, it seems like one of the most difficult things you can do if you want to get your food, it's because you're going into an alien environment and you're holding your

Speaker 2:          12:46          breath. True. But actually the human body, that's the main argument I get from people. They tell me, Oh, I could never do it, but every, the human body is actually made to do this. So there's a thing called the Mammalian dive reflex, and this is very present and aquatic mammals such as like, it's like a Dolphin's, your sales and things like that. And the human have it in a very way, weaker way, but we still have it. And so when you emerge as you face on the water, your heartbeat is automatically going to slow down, especially if the water is colder. So you bodies, as you're getting prepared to hold his breath to catch food, and that's, that's a new DNA. Is it preparing to catch food or is it just preparing to survive to hold your breath on the water? Right. Some reason. I mean, I, I guess, I guess that was a very successive, thank you so.
