Speaker 1:          00:00          Is Steve Bay going to get another shot at? It should. Huh? You know what I mean? This is what people are thinking and people thinking, you know, the guy fights wins more UFC title defenses than anybody in the history of the sport. Three becomes a, you know, the most accomplished heavyweight of all time. I mean, you think about what he's done. Do you think about the fact that he knocks off for BC over doomed to win the title? He knocks out ouster over and defend the title, knocks out junior dos Santos stops, uh, beats Francis when everybody's terrified of Francis. I mean, he became the most accomplished heavyweight of all time. Right? Then he gets knocked out in the first round of crazy perfect punch by Daniel Cormier and a perfect strategy and you got to go. Well, he, uh, for sure I'd like to see a rematch.

Speaker 1:          00:46          It's like, when do you want to see them beat somebody first and then have a rematch? I actually want to see, but for me, Dan Daniel, me, I've always said is the most impressive fighter to ever step in the octagon in terms of his stature. I just think he's incredible, right? He said to me the best I want to see him fight Jon Jones. I know that John John's, they say Islamic. Phil is where the big money's on him versus Brock. Okay. So even with Alexander Guts, when all this tool, five donkeys Yoel mail, he's like, well that's not happening. Yeah, I'm retiring in March. We ready to go January worsen. Just ask for a title shot now after he just beat Glover. And so, you know, he said something like, Hey, you know, like I love the UFC is going to be as Brock. The fight is broad questions.

Speaker 1:          01:31          The narrative guys. Ken Brock, pass tests. Look at me. Yeah. Yeah. You know, how long do you need to go back? Goes out. How long do you need before? It's like dancers. Never. Brian Gustafson opens up on crazy situation taking him off UFC two 27th this year's. Well, it, what's, what happens, we'll talk about it. Oh, he won't talk about it then how is he opening up? Cut will cause people were like, oh you won't find Anthony Smith but you'll fight DC or you'll find a heavyweight. But now all of a sudden injured and they fight Anthony Smith versus Shogun was a fight that I was concerned about. I thought shogun retire. Yeah. However he won three in a row. If you would have one that I wanted to see him get a tough shot against DC cause I went to DC to get paid. Well show gun is, he was ranked I think eighth eight for this fight.

Speaker 1:          02:21          But even though he's not that old. How old is Shogun? 134 how old corridors and fight world fucking Brazilian tortoise. The unibrow. How old is showing up? I think it's like 36 right? He's my age. Is he 36 year old older even though he's 36 like look when Bernard Hopkins, who's 36 is when he knocked out Tito Trinidad is in his prime. His prime when he beat Kelly Pavlock he was, I think he was close to 40 or all it might have been 42 and yeah, so that's not a Kelly Palette killer. Yeah. Not for everybody. It doesn't mean that they're past their prime, but Shogun, I've in so many wars and he got knocked out by Dan Henderson, Stephane brother. Everybody's different. In 19 came on the Grand Prix. It's terrifying, man. Pride days too. It was different. Different world, different world. The drugs and don't like, and now we got the grant snitch.

Speaker 1:          03:13          It's such a different environment. Yeah, man. You'd never know who was doing what back then when they were at, there was a mother fuckers five. He's a town on the fucker. Let's not just propel them to fight gusts. No, no, no, no. Dude, let me them. While he was ready, he was ready. He wanted the fight looking. Here's the argument for it. The argument for it is he knocks out, were shot on short notice. He knocks out shogun and then he'll say, look, I'll take this fight to, that guy's rolling and he's a veteran. He's got momentum. You don't know, fight the fight. The most intriguing fight to me would be, I mean it's not Brock and I liked that. I liked PROC DC because DC gets paid by me. The only reason, but the demo, the most intriguing to me and a lot of ways would be y'all out Ramiro at two oh five and deal with that weight cut with Daniel Cormier. Well, cornea was like, Nah, Nah, you can't lose at this fight. And you miss wait, go. Yeah, sure. And you miss wait, smart. But then Yo L's like, listen DC, you cheated when you made weight. You know you were pushing down that towel that one time. Okay, that one time. That one time. That was real. We want to talk about cheating and for ELL to DC. What are you saying? A branch. Dual gate. Oh, still get here.
