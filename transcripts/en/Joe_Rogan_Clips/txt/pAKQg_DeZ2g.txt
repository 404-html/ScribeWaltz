Speaker 1:          00:00          Locked in a, essentially it's ego, but it's, it's a, it's, it's, it's not an international conversation. It's a, it's, it's a game of, you know, who, who is, who is basically checking the right boxes in their own little confirmation bias to their own audience. And that doesn't interest me, but it's frustrating. You're all sorts of, but you're also the best person on the other side of that conversation now. So there's a series of videos on Youtube, I think it's called Merry Christmas, Mr [inaudible]. Yeah, that's right. And so on youtube you can watch for him, pit it against people who are playing this game. You know, Islamists and jihadists are various boards and that he, Majid is meeting them on your interview show is mostly in the UK where they're pretending to be more benign than they are. And that, and Majid, as you know, finding the question that sort of pulls back the mask on the theocrat and it's, it's hilarious.

Speaker 1:          00:50          It's very funny that one video that you publish on your blog. I've sent to dozens of my friends that one video where there's this guy and he's addressing this enormous group of people and he's talking about is this radical Islam or is this Islam that that was I think a conference in Norway that was just, I mean, these dots straight up in his limits and jihad is addressing a crowd of seemingly mainstream Muslims in Norway. But he just by show of hands, you know, is it, are we extremist if we think a stage should be killed? It's, it's pretty, it's stunning. It's an amazing documentary. Yeah. And respect to the way they want to treat homosexuals, pos dates. I mean, the whole thing is, is this Islam or is this radical Islam talking of ideology blinkering statistical data on the subject of homosexuality. So in the United Kingdom, a poll was done last year asking, so there've been two poles gauging public Muslim attitudes towards guys.

Speaker 1:          01:47          Uh, the first asked how many Muslims in the UK find homosexuality is morally acceptable and 0%. This is by the way, by professional polling company. It's not just some student that's devised a poll on Twitter. A professional polling company found that 0% of British Muslims responded to a poll saying that they found homosexuality morally acceptable. And then a year later, which now last year, another poll, uh, was, uh, was conducted. And uh, that was uh, an ICM poll asking, uh, where the British Melissa, how many British Muslims believe that homosexuality should be criminalized or remain legal. And uh, I think it was roughly 52%, 52%, if my memory serves me correctly, said of British Muslims said that they would wish for homosexuality to be criminalized. And of course, what does criminalization of homosexuality mean under Sharia and traditional Islamic jurisprudence? We know that it's punished by death. So these are these, this is scientific data from gauging, you know, attitudes.

Speaker 1:          02:49          British wasn't an attitude towards homosexuality, but the ideological blinkers will, will kick in and refuse to see that truth. And these aren't, Islam is unfortunately my dialogue with Sam. We talk this, that there are the Islamists who want to, who actively wants to take over a country and enforce their version of Islam. Then there's underneath that there's a, a softer landing of very, very conservative stroke fundamentalist attitudes that unfortunately have become widespread. And here is an example of it that is, that is being gauged by scientific polling methodology that tells us there's a problem. And unfortunately if one were to speak in this way, um, especially in, in Europe, uh, one is received by my own political tribe and that's liberals center left and further. One is met with denial and called a bigot simply for re relaying these facts. A quarter of British Muslims when asked about the massacre at the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris a quarter said that those attacks are justifiable.

Speaker 1:          03:49          They sympathize with the attackers as opposed to the victims who were the staff at the Charlie Hebdo offices. So this is what led you to be put on the southern poverty law, speaking in these terms. And unfortunately it's reporting polling data. And what it does for me is to say, this is why it's so important to address these issues, to have these conversations, to try and empower those Muslim voices that are seeking to challenge this sort of, these sorts of attitudes and, and carve out a space. And if, you know, if, if one can do that with Catholicism in Europe and go through a reformation and end up with an enlightenment and ended up with secularism in the West, what I often say is American liberals are very happy, challenging their own Bible belt. And yet we have a core, an belt within our communities. And if I'm attempting to replicate the equivalent of challenging the Bible belt within Muslim communities, it means addressing these issues.

Speaker 1:          04:42          And yet they grant to themselves the right to challenge the Bible belt within America. And yet, if we were to challenge what I call the, an belt in Europe were suddenly called bigots. Um, you know, and Islamophobes is this, is this static has been moving, has it been adjusting and changing? Is there any sort of a recognition that there's an issue with this? So you know, the emergence of Isis really did bring it to the fore and it really did quiet and some of the voices, it also did increase the hysteria from the far left because they began panicking thinking, actually we're going to lose this debate. And that's where I noticed their labeling became even stronger. But the emergence of Isis did wake up a lot of people to, to the challenges we're facing here because so many European born and raised Muslims went over to join isis.

Speaker 1:          05:29          And of course think about it in this sense, the most infamous and notorious execution sell that I think were erroneously called the jihadi beetles in the press because actually it really does. It's an insult to the Beatles, but it was a diminishes the true horror of these guys. You know, they call him Jihadi John and, but the isis execution is basically that entire cell of the media face of Isis execution cell. We're all British Muslims. And that should tell you something that we've got the worst terrorist group educator. I mean, the thing is a university graduate like every variable that the, that the far left wants to marshal to explain this phenomenon like lack of educational opportunity, lack of economic opportunity, lack of social integration, mental illness. Uh, you, you can, you can find people who had massive opportunity. I missed that. You weren't getting, you weren't a jihadist, but you are an Islamist.

Speaker 1:          06:18          But let me Europe person who, that's where I can basically play in a game he wanted to me, you're, you're like a, he's, he's, he's, he's somebody who back to the superman. He can run, he can run for political office. He hasn't been elected yet, but he, you know, he should be, I mean this is the quarterback of the football team. Ian. This context is a candidate for recruitment. Well, thesis, think of, think of it this way. We've got the worst terrorist group in our lifetime. It one can reasonably say, is Isis, right? The worst terrorist group, at least in living memory, is isis and the worst cell, you know, it's the execution cell came from a fully developed for once of a better own fuss, wild country. And that was Britain and Mohammed. I'm Waze. The leader of that execution sell, graduated from the University of Westminster, was given as a young child, was given political asylum by Britain because his family were Kuwaiti and they fled the invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein, the country that the west liberated.

Speaker 1:          07:15          And he turned against that country. So he had every reason to like Britain. Britain gave my home, gave him or actually physically bricks and mortar house, gave his family on social costs that gave him social housing. They educated him. He graduated from university and they liberated his father's country from an aggressor. And this man turned against this country that helped him and his family and his nation. Was he captured or did he do, he's dead. One of them has been captured, but uh, he's currently being held in Turkey. I would, it would be fascinating to listen to. His rationale is it was not so that the other one, I forgot his name, but he was just interviewing you don't get a lot out of him. He was interviewed by female Arab journalist. You Watch that? No, that was ever happened there. And so on and dismissive character. Yeah. Yeah. He, he, he refused to talk about much. He said, uh, you know, these are accurate accusations and allegations that you're making, and I will wait to trial. Uh, in the end, he kind of cut the interview short. He seemed a little put out that she was a woman. As I'm looking at you now, imagine she's the interviewer and, and, and she's asking me questions and I'm looking in this direction in your direction. He'll literally never laid eyes on her and it, yeah, it's bad. And LP.
