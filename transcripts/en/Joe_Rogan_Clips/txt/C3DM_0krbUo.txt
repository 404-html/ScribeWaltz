Speaker 1:          00:00          You don't ever have to buy meat in Australia? No. No. Do you ever buy meat? If we're eating chicken, yeah, that's about it. But just to mix it up. Yeah. The fridge is full. I feel only friends, fridges, me, families, fridges. So funny chicken. What's that? Mountain lion tastes like fucking delicious. That's what I keep hearing. It's delicious and people get angry. It's so strange to me how angry people get if you kill a mountain line. Yeah. Cause I think they think that if you kill it, it's different than killing a deer or something. That's a normal thing to eat. Even more than a bear. It is get more angry. So kitty cat. Yeah. Yeah. Meanwhile that motherfucker will kill you. I had a bunch of people saying, you know, you shouldn't have killed her loan. See Mountain lions like I see you dear. I'm fucking know shit.

Speaker 1:          00:46          Cause if you've seen mountain Lykes lines, like you seen deer, there'd be no dear. It's as simple as that. You know, I don't know what the numbers are, but there's probably supposed to be like one mountain line for every 500 deer or something like that. Yeah, that's right. And they're sneaky creature. You know, you're not supposed to say I'm, they're not like that. Listen, you, you could go your whole life not seeing them and they can be around you all the time. Yeah, definitely. That's a fact. If you live in the wilderness, if you live in Montana or you live in Colorado and you live in the woods, you might see one every few years, you might might issue years and they are fucking everywhere. Yeah. I'll say prints all the time, but I'll never say a cat. Like I've actually never seen a cat in a wall or set for the one that I hunted.

Speaker 1:          01:32          And um, that's like that story I was telling you before, like it was eight and a cough, but they typically kill a deer every single day. So it's fucking deer. The human, Brian allows us to manage things in a certain way, you know, and it's like these biologist support all this study and research in the, you know, go on. Okay, you can hunt males in this area. So that's all I could hunt where I was. I could only shoot a male, a male. Well that's when the dogs come in handy. So like I've always, I've never really wanted to hunt with dogs cause I like to do all the hunting myself. But um, there's a special bond between the hunter and the dogs when you're hunting, that's for sure. And it was actually a really good experience. I really loved it. But a lot of people frown on using dogs.

Speaker 1:          02:14          But the best way to, to determine the sex is the dogs. We'll track it and the line will take refuge in a tree and then you can have a look at a genitals and make sure it's a male was binoculars. Yeah. Yeah. Or sometimes if they're low enough you can tell if the human eye, so the first thing we established was, well it was a line that I wanted the lion that had killed that calf was eating that calf alive. We ended up getting, uh, getting the ranch to come in and he ended up putting a calf out of its misery. It couldn't be saved and a then we put the dogs back on that mountain lion track and I chased him about seven miles and they end up training. We got, we marched in and hawked into Detroit and ended up determining that it was a male.

Speaker 1:          02:54          And then, um, I ended up shooting and it wasn't really good deaf. It was quick. But um, if it was a female would have had to have left where we were. Some states aren't like that and counties aren't like that where it can be male and female if the population is too high. What they're trying to do in that part of Colorado is just keep that mountain lion population healthy and how they determined that was by shooting males only. That could change next year. They could have a rise in mountain lion, a decrease in the mule deer and other animals. So they might change that again, but we could only shoot them mail. So yeah, the problem in America, um, particularly in California where they outlawed hunting with dogs, is that the perception of using a dog to go after an animal, the perception is that it's not fair, but people, I mean, there's going to be hard for some people, especially animal lovers to understand, but that is the only effective way to hunt for mountain lions because there's no way you're going to sneak up on them.

Speaker 1:          03:51          You're just not. You're not going to see that. That's when numbers start to bloom. And other animals like meal deer and stuff started to plummet, which I've heard a lot that's happening in California, is the mule deer population. She has been decimated because there's no control on the mountain lions. Well, they do have control the mountain lions, but only government employees killed the mountain lion kill. Ironically, the same amount of mountain lions they were killing when they were hunting is insane. It's insane. But instead of people paying money to do it and getting it ties back into conservation and getting the eat the mountain line, which I know again people like, what are you talking about eating mountain line. I'm telling you folks, I haven't eaten one, but I'm telling you and you said it. Brunello said it's one of the most delicious animals he's ever eaten.

Speaker 1:          04:35          All wanted to bring you sound, but it's actually illegal to bring it in to California. Good thing we always abide by the law. Adam Green Tree and then one day I'll try it. So then I've cooked it up and I'm fading it to Kim and I was cooking chicken as well just in case her and the kids didn't like it. I had chicken on the grill as well and I said the mountain line first and now we're eating the mountain lion and I'm like, what do you think of it? And she's like, Oh, I've got the chicken. I'm like, no you don't. You've got the mountain lion. And it was delicious. Dude. It's tender as I felt like it was a Tice between like chicken and pork or chicken. And even venison. Like I found it right in the middle there. It's delicious. And I'm not saying everyone should go out and hunt a mountain line cause you can't do that.

Speaker 1:          05:20          Right. But there's certain places that you can go and get a tag for the benefit of wildlife and go and hunter mountain line people who just have a hard time with the idea that you are somehow or another helping to control the population by killing an animal that kills other animals. Yeah. Yeah. It's really weird. They would rather let nature take its course, but what, so even if like, like let's go to Africa now, even if the lion population why outweighed something and was running it to extinction, these people would want to see it back and just let that happen. And it's like humans have got a Brian capacity that allows us to study and put research into an animal that's like actually what would be more healthier for the whole eco system would be if we come in and hunt these animals. And what we'll do is we'll charge people a certain tag fee to be able to do that.

Speaker 1:          06:10          And we'll put that back into conservation, which will help this animal. And then there's just this beautiful healthy bowl that keeps turning. Yeah. For the people that know it, they respect it and they appreciate it. You know, people like back country hunters and anglers and all these different organizations, Rocky Mountain Elk Federation, a lot of different organizations that they have in the United States that really appreciate what they're doing to promote that, that, that idea here in America. But people that don't hunt and don't, don't go into, I mean it took me years to kind of wrap my head around it and really truly understand it and become educated as to how it works and how wildlife biologists set these standards and they do it based on healthy populations and how much time they spend doing surveys and analyzing the population, how important it is to, you know, these reports and hunter send in to wildlife organizations and the department of fish and game.

Speaker 1:          07:00          It's really interesting stuff and I'm not a blanket killer evil because I understand where those people are coming from as well. And we needed to, we need a certain amount of that because it could go the opposite way where it's like, let's just go out and hunt everything, and it's not the case if something's not in a good, healthy population. I'm not interested in hunting and overall myself. Of course. Yeah. Now I want to say these animals stay here for forever. I want my kids, kids, kids, kids, to be able to see those animals in good health, healthy population.
