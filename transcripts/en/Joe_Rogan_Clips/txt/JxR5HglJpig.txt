Speaker 1:          00:00          And it's funny because when people see old pictures of me, they say I either look like the Jersey, like a jersey shore wannabe or like a backstreet boys wanted me cause I looked like, cause I had the earrings in and I had the hair totally spite. And yet that was the style at the time we were also running a risk because you've got like a little bit of facial hair. Yeah. Yeah. I don't have, it's not very masculine. No a beard, but she's got something going on. It's definitely a man or you're a woman undergoing hormone replacement therapy. You got that Chaz Bono type thing. It's um, this is called a lazy man's beard because I can't even even really grow a beard. So it's just this is what it is when I get lazy. You got a little something going on though? Yeah, I guess so.

Speaker 1:          00:37          Maybe it's the finasteride just had the mustache itself though. It be kind of creepy. No mustaches. I'm going on a jihad against mustache just because I think for whatever reason they look more ridiculous than full facial hair. I don't know why. Some people like, like Sam Elliott, the actor. I don't know who that is. I know. I know Tom Selleck, so I've seen roadhouse. Which guy is it in row? Sam Elliott. Everybody knows who that's not the main character. Patrick Swayze. Oh my. Yeah, but he's got the, he's got the fucking mustached. What a man. But the GRANDPA vibe going on that he didn't always go to roadhouse. Go to look at that. Sam Elliott. He's a great voice. Nobody's blowing him because he has a mustache. Easy blow his fucking game area. Look at that. Come on. Yeah, I mean with the, the hair right there. Right there. That's him and roadhouse.

Speaker 1:          01:30          Yeah, but that's a full beard. That's more of a full beard. That's true. And that looks better on them. I Dunno. Look at that. Oh, come on now. I don't think a go to that. I got that one right there. I don't think a goatee looks as ridiculous as a mustache alone. Some guys can pull it off. It's a bold choice, but it can't look, you can't look overly Archie with it. You know what I mean? You can't or you can't. No you can't. If you're, if it looks like you're tied to your goatee as a matter of your identity, then it's a problem. But if it's just a dude who seems like he's rocking a goatee cause he just decided one day to rock a goatee, then it's all right. You know what kind of died out the soul patch, the soul patch. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:10          I haven't seen one of those in forever. You know, that kind of went away. Did you ever have any facial hair? No beard, just beards. I grew up way out at one point in time because a, there's a guy named Evan Tanner who was a MMA fighter that was known for having a big, thick, crazy beard. He was a really interesting guy and he really nice guy too. And he died in, um, he went on sort of a walkabout and decided to go in death valley and camp out and um, he ran out of water. It couldn't find his water and any wound up dying from heat. And a lot of us were pretty broken up about it. So a bunch of people online decided to grow out our beards for a certain amount of months. That's me with a full beard. Wow. So you get a an almost, you could get a caveman beard going if you want it.

Speaker 1:          02:55          Oh yeah. I get a full beard. Yeah. And that's me trimming around the cheeks because my shit, my shit creeps all the way up to my nostrils. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I grew that out for a couple of months. I forget how long we decided to go look at, you know, what are you doing? Listen, that was when he wanted to play Robert Shapiro. Didn't he do that for the Oj movie? I feel like it was okay. Maybe it's just, yeah, that this, uh, verifies every single, you know, whisper about John Travolta, tickle a ball. Tickets. That's what it is. Just to, it's right there for tickle him balls. Anyway.
