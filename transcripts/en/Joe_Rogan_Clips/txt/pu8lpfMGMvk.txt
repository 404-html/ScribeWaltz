Speaker 1:          00:00          Would do things in the FBI would let them get away with it because they were providing information that was the whole ball. Exactly right, and he fought. Two guys died in prison wrongly. By the way, this guy's not a fucking good guy. I know. He's a marine and decorated marine in Shit. They make those sacrifices. They make those decisions where they're just going to like help a person who's a criminal because they're criminals providing information that can allow them to get more criminal large, wide. He was providing all kinds of shit about the guineas and he sponsored.

Speaker 1:          00:30          That was a great movie too, by the way. Nice to train a guy who was one of the, he's Hitman. Dana White. No, no, no. Tito. I see like a threatened, he had to move out of town. It was a ball. Joe Wasn't balls. Baltar related. Yes. It was both elated. When I was teaching taekwondo, I had one of the guys that was in my class. It was whacking people for what he Bolger. He was asking me, if you want to kill somebody with your bare hands, where would you hit him? I was like the neck. I was like 18. I was like, oh, he goes, correct Joe? Good. Yeah, I like that. Who was it, Kevin? Uh, no, no, no. But you know Kevin, you know, he went away to this, um, now the top kit. Yeah. All related. All of them together, you know.

Speaker 1:          01:07          Um, this guy was a different guy. This guy, this guy was, he went away too. But I mean, he went away forever. He was one of those guys. Like they caught him with blood under his fingernails and he was working with white. Yeah. Yeah. Well there's a lot of guys that were, I mean, it was a big organization when, when we were kids. I mean, everybody knew it was a big org. I mean, it wasn't a fucking secret. Oh No. Oh, I know. How did Hannity's attempt to link Mower to Whitey Bulger? Hold up this article in the Boston Globe. So that's not true. What ever. It's the FBI. He wasn't, wasn't there. It wasn't there then. Oh, he wasn't at the FBI. Lower serve the US attorney's office in Boston from 82 to 88, his chief of the criminal division, first assistant us attorney and acting us attorney for more than a year.

Speaker 1:          01:49          During that time, Bolger ran a sprawling criminal enterprise and got away with murders because he was a longtime FBI informant who corrupted his handlers, the FBI. He corrupted his handlers. I love it. And the FBI and the New Guinea to know organized crime strike force, a prosecutor prosecutorial unit that worked independently in the US Attorney's office reportedly, uh, reported directly to the Justice Department, used Bulger to build cases against the mafia and give him a pass on its own crimes. The FBI is corrupt. Relationship with Bulger was exposed after he was indicted on federal racketeering charges in 1995 became a fugitive. He was captured 16 years later, I would hear, you know, so, uh, yeah, it was captured in Santa Monica. And, uh, so when did Mueller says did mujer no, the four minute had been wrongly convicted and look the other way, there's nothing linking Mueller to that case.

Speaker 1:          02:39          According to several attorneys for, for the men volumous court records and a former federal judge who presided over their wrongful imprisonment trial in 2007, the US District Judge Nancy Gertner found the FBI deliberately withheld evidence at the foremen were innocent. The bureau helped cover up the injustice for deck cheese, Chrysler fucking hate reading shit like that. She ordered the government to pay the men and their families 101.7 million. Okay, maybe worth it. How long did you guys go away for? Let's be honest, you're never going to make a hundred millions chicken scratch too. All got 100 million. If every one of them got 100 million. I mean I'm, I'm in. I mean, how much time do you have to do? How many times do you get fucked where you're in jail? How's it? How bad money per load? Fuck man. So maybe it was just a rumor that he was a part of that.

Speaker 1:          03:30          Well, like you said though, let's, the FBI, soon as a story broke shut, they call the paper and said, listen, get your facts straight. Well, how crazy is it? The FBI covered up the information and knew those guys were innocent. That is dark. Who went to jail for that? Did the guys who covered it up and go to jail? I'm not sure, but a couple of them died. You can't died in jail. Two of them died in jail. Oh, you know they caught him because his wife was yelling and shit all the time. Yeah, she was cocoa. He had fucking cash on the walls and shit. I used to sell dope, meet door to door when I, before I started comedy and I used to go to fuck, I went the hell, not one where I was and I would, I would want the white people look at my, I'd take out my shit and they go, that's slapped up.

Speaker 1:          04:14          Break sound like 40 bucks a pop, get the fuck on. And then somebody explained to me, you know what the hell is like, why he bolts? Wow. So you were selling meat in his neighborhood. Fucking same in East Boston. I knocked at the door a couple of guys and revere that we'll get like fucking connected. My buddy l know who they were and shit later on. Well, they probably knew people from meatpacking. They've probably got it right off the books of course. And I'm like, I'm doing my little spiel there for a boy. Look, you know, a fucking boiler room operation. Now you break it down per mail, it comes out, they're three bucks a week and they're doing the math in the head. You could tell they were like bookies, you know, I feel like that's like 40 bucks a pump. Get the fuck up. My steps wasn't really that much, but it was, it was ridiculous, you know?

Speaker 1:          04:55          But uh, and I was in Rhode Island, a banging doors and, and, and uh, I got the same response and I looked down, I see in the streets, the lines of the streets are red, white, and green. I was in federal hill and providence with the mafia stock. Look at that sign. Look at that article. Look at this Whitey Bulger, Santa Monica high. That was full of money. It's still brims with mystery. He was living in like a normal apartment. I know. So weird. He had $822,000 in cash and valuables. Wow. Jesus Christ. I liked that movie. I thought Johnny Depp was great. And uh, yeah, he was, he was great in it. Yeah. That's a creepy dude. Yeah. He was as creepy as they get. It's just amazing how much corruption was involved in that case. Yes. And at which the federal government was a part of it and they let that monster, they let them thrive.

Speaker 1:          05:40          Yeah. Yeah. So it makes you wonder about the FBI today. Well, it should make you wonder, shows what they're capable of it. That way. Whenever you're doing that, whenever you're allowing someone to commit murder and deal drugs to get other people that are committing murder and dealing drugs, like what? Because they would just want it. They just look what happens with cops in this is very unfortunate. But this is just, is just what happens when you have a a game and the game is arrest people. The game is when, right. You have a certain amount of calls you have to make, and if you could make more callers because you're in bed with a bad guy, especially if maybe you grow up in that neighborhood has always been kind of an accepted part of that neighborhood. Yeah. That Guy Conley grew up with one. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Exactly. It makes a sneaky little deal. Yeah. It was, Sam had lawyers. It's all about you have to have it. It's like sports. You have to have a winning record. Yeah. You're not going to succeed. So they, yeah. You know, play outside the rules. I mean, that's one of the reasons why cops and people have such a weird relationship because they're always looking to arrest people and [inaudible] cops talking to her like, ah, I don't put me on your record. I'm on. Yeah.
