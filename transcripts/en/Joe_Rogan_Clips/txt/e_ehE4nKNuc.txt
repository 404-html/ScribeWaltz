Speaker 1:          00:00          All right. Anyone with 18 of anything, unless you're like a salt and you probably don't have a ton anyway unless you're Jeff Bezos. Yeah. Well that was uh, yeah, he could, he could marry a hundred chicks and give them all a billion. That's how you still that 50 leftover. What? Yeah, he's doing good. He's doing good. But that whole thing with him, that was an interesting thing. The uh, the pictures being leaked and it turns out that the brother that leaked the pictures, I love the brother immediately as soon as I read the article because I'm like, this is Trump's daughter, not only is a Trump supporter, this is a guy who's tried to leverage himself forever and he found out his hits was fucking Jeff Paizos. Can you imagine the night he found that out? The night he found that out? Where was he? What was he doing?

Speaker 1:          00:39          He was somewhere thinking, this is it. She's fucked. A lot of people that are good now. She's fucking basis now. Some cash in. Now it's time to think of something good. How do we do it? This is a plot in guy. I wonder what they inquire gave him how much money you get for something like that. Half a mil. Bayzos Dick. I want more. I want a solid mill. Solid mill. You think that's kind of the life he's going to kill you. You think he will? If he doesn't, I'll be disappointed. It's a good point. And make it look like an accident. If you're a fucking, you know he's, he's like daddy Warbucks. Yeah, he's the guy. He's the guy. He's kind of hundreds automated. Everything's automated. Everything and Amazon's like notoriously like he's an alien. He looks like he's artificial intelligence. He's Ai. He has that look already. He's super smart and he can play it real slow. Yeah. Helen slave the world and you know what? Let him, he's probably going to hire somebody to fuck up that guy's life slowly. I'm sure you're ready. Has real slow. Oh yeah. This is your new job. Your new job is to slowly make dark guys lodash. Yeah. Everything. Everything. Flat tires every day. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:50          I love the henchman that's going at nailing flat tires. Yeah. Set up. He's going to check for cameras. That's amazing. Yeah. The at the base offices, those are the new type. Like cause I studied a lot about like Rockefeller, Carnegie, guys like that. And those guys, nobody say amassed a fortune of those guys had Rockefeller had like 336 billion in today's dollars. Good Lord. Yeah. Carnegie at 372 billion. I mean these, these were the first, how much do they have in their time? Ah, cause the questions and there are times, I don't know, but in, in it was millions. Well I don't think it was billions, but in our time it's about, it's the over 300 million. Both of them. These were the first generation of B, B B. This was the first generation of Robert Bat. Like the first generation of entrepreneurs, you know, the country was new.

Speaker 1:          02:34          All of these industries were just emerging and these guys took it over. Bayzos tech is, and somebody said this on my podcast recently. Tech is the closest thing we have now to that where you have these, you know, masters of the universe that are going to be, I mean those guys were big. Jp Morgan was like bailing the government out. These guys had an insane amount of power. Um, they know what's really helpful. Really interesting figures. Yeah. I was just, when I told you I was doing this chariots, the gods lunch today with a bunch of very influential people and one of them said it's really ironic that apple used to be think different and that was the whole thing about silicon valley. Think different now. It's don't think different right now. Streamline everybody into one acceptable thing. Yeah. Now it is literally you have to think the way everyone else is thinking.

Speaker 1:          03:22          You have to believe what everyone else believes, even if it's ridiculous. I think a lot of that is they want to just make money and sell things and they don't want any discord. They just want to sell, make money. Sort of. But it seems like, I don't think, cause they don't band people after they do the things they banned him after. There's a public outcry. So to me they're not, they don't have any real value. It's their values are tangible and the values are influenced by public opinion and where media is, the values aren't like when somebody says something, let's ban, and right now this goes against our thing. A lot of it is if you wait until there's enough dust kicked up, then they will ban somebody. Right. That's true. So to me, I get in arguments with friends when they're like their ideological, I'm like, they have an ideological bet certainly.

Speaker 1:          04:06          But the profit seeking enterprises that just want everyone to be happy. I think if it was up to Twitter, every tweet would be some type of branded ad. And on top of that, now the ideology is skewing and leaning in that direction in terms of like tech and sure, there's money in that. There's money in holding that line. And those guys are the ones that are as powerful as Rockefeller and Carnegie and JP, like all, all of those guys, they are the next, you know, generation of people who will, their amount of power is, is unmatched anywhere in society.
