Speaker 1:          00:00          And in the conservative world has to be careful. This podcast could sink a ship.

Speaker 2:          00:03          I'm pro nuance. Yeah. How'd you come up with a shirt pro nuance. I know. Shit. Listen, I think the way that I came up with it is because in the, in the hunting world there is this, speaking of conservative, there's this like there's the conservative traditional district and there's the more progressive folks that you have met and been around. You've been around both, but it'd be around both Eder more environmentalist's, more public lands, more access. Right. So there's kind of like to, of course there's always two sides of politics, but they're just in this case, two distinct sides, right? And the line kind of gets drawn around one a little bit around guns, but also a little bit around the environment. So part of the biggest issue in, in politics for a hunter angler right now is like, I really like guns. I like the second amendment. I dig what's going on there. I'd like to support that. But what I also like is healthy ecosystems and environment and I, and I like habitat for wild game to live. And public lands and access. Well, it just so happens that a lot of the a plus rated politicians for the NRA are like f minus or a d plus rated in protecting wildlife and wild lands. And a lot of that's around extraction and different things like that. But extraction

Speaker 1:          01:12          minerals and oil and natural from valuable lands. Right. So then change the way these lands are scheduled. What it's under.

Speaker 2:          01:21          Yeah. I mean there was a lot of action. This is our around monuments, of course that was one big one, but it's, it's just around like the general basis of even as a hunter, but all Americans. But as a hunter, I'm faced with like I love wildlife, I love wild places, clean water, clean lands, I'm all for that. That's a huge part of what I believe that. But I also believe in the second amendment. I believe in my rights to defend my family. I believe in my right to to own firearms and to, and to do that. So I believe in those two things, but because our politics are the way they are, it doesn't leave room for those two beliefs. When I'm at at the voting booth, sometimes not all the time,

Speaker 1:          01:57          hardly leaves room for those beliefs in normal conversations with people, unless you absolutely know that the person's going to be objective and as your shirt says pro nuance this, that the idea that you, you shouldn't be able to defend your family is where it gets crazy. Yeah. It doesn't get crazy that you want to be able to defend your family. Like why do these movies all have robberies and breakins and bad guys? Well, why did you visit a real things? It's a real thing. So the idea that you should just be a sitting duck because there's so many crazy fucks out there that want to shoot up schools and go on mass shootings. It somehow or another you are being conflated with them that you're going to be being got confused with them or categorize with them. Like how, how is that? These are different things. They are just both involve guns. They are their things. It's like the insole that drove all of those people in Toronto. I remember that. Yup. You know what? If that keeps happening. That's happened many times. You've seen people kill people cars over the last few years.

Speaker 2:          03:00          It's been like four or five big events. Are they mutually exclusive? Like I want to be able to defend my family and own firearms and have that freedom. That's big part of this country. But I also don't want people to die. Exactly. In mass shootings. I don't want that. I want worse on the other side of the coin with when it comes to like environmental issues and around hunting public lands and things of that nature. I want coal miners to have jobs. I want people that work in an extraction industries to have an opportunity to work and live and do what they need to do. But I also want to protect our ecosystems at all costs because you can't replace that shit.

Speaker 1:          03:33          Right. And there's gotta be other jobs out there. If the government put its resources instead of propping up old ways of doing business that pollute the environment versus new ways of doing business are certain cities and with with government programs, that's entirely possible.

Speaker 2:          03:51          Yeah. There are certainly reasonable and and healthy ways to mine copper or are there ways to, I don't know. There is, I mean there's responsible ways to do that, but at what, at what costs? You're still, you're still extracting, right? You're still doing something, do it. You're still changing the natural environment there.

Speaker 1:          04:12          Yeah. Someone was trying to make that, that argument with fracking with me. I was talking to him about that. Is it Josh Fox's documentary? Um, what is, uh, he, he was on the podcast, the um, something fracking nation. What was his, uh, he made a, it was a very good documentary and it was when I had him on the podcast was interesting because he seemed like he had been attacked a lot for it and even misunderstood. Like some of the questions I was asking, like maybe they were coming from me and I will say, no, this is just like, what was it called? Fractionation? What does it, yes. Gaslamp. That's it. Oh yeah. I said, okay. It's um, it's disturbing. Like you're watching some aspects of it, like when they were wedding lighting, their water on fire and then someone tried to say, oh, there's some places where you've always been able to let your water on fire, and I was like, okay, wait, okay, the lighting your water on size. Real argument that someone said that that's not really from fracking and I said, okay, these people said that there was no lighting, the water on fire. Then people started fracking. The water smell like shit. They started lighting on fire though. You're saying those are not connected?

Speaker 2:          05:17          Well, over the years, Joe, we've been able to light our water on fire for a number of reasons, but 4th of July

Speaker 1:          05:23          I would think to be confident about that, and I'm not confident about it, but to be confident about what that guy said to me when he was saying that, it's always been like that. You would have to have done massive research. You would have to spent time there. You would have to been working either directly or indirectly with the scientists that are collecting the data. You'd have to get it from them. You'd have to know, you'd have to see it, you'd have to make sure was sure. Or you have to be a person who is not interested in the actual truth. They just have an idea that they want to push through. And this is a weird thing. Certain right wing folks, there's a weird thing they want to push through that business is good and environmentalist are all pussies and hippies and Weirdos and losers and these things don't jive in the world of someone who actually loves and appreciates the actual earth of course, man, because weird. But

Speaker 2:          06:16          there is no way that anyone could argue, right? There's, there's in the hunting world or something like access and, and public land and all these things become a big deal. But you can define access in a ton of different ways. To me, accessible to me, access could be I like wilderness or did the only way you can access it is on foot via, via trailhead. Someone else might say, access to me is uh, elderly folks or disabled folks bail them to get on into a car and drive through a road and public land. Or, or get into an ATV and drive. And so politics are being what they are. Politicians take this term of access. It happened around national monuments. They take one side said the president is stealing your land and the other side says, the president is giving back your land. Somebody there either both sides are full of shit or one of them is,

Speaker 1:          07:09          I remember when this came up, Patagonia, which is a giant company in the trap doors, had a big ad on the Internet that said the president just stole your land. And then I heard Rinella talk about, and he said, this is, I'm going to paraphrase, but he basically said, if you say that the presence until your land, you're not being careful with your words. Yes. And you're not being asked.

Speaker 2:          07:29          You're being inflammatory. Yes. You're being absolutely inflammatory. Yeah. Because it's not again, that that you're talking about grand staircase Escalante in bears ears, National Monument bears ears being in Utah, being explained to people what happened the boy, um, I'll, I'll do my best. Thank you Ben. So, so the antiquities act, let's get back to the antiquities act to protect the antiquities act is to protect, um, culturally or socially, emotionally, culturally significant pieces of land, all the way to things like the Grand Canyon. Right? And so spin it up to the end of, there's a lot that I just skipped over, but I'm going to spin it up to the end of the Obama administration. President Obama used his executive power to protect large swaths, millions of acres around that bow around bears ears national monument to protect not only the, the significant places for native Americans and for, um, native tribesman around bears ears, but many millions of acres around that.

Speaker 2:          08:35          And so then it becomes the problem I have in the why that kind of, that tee shirt exists. It becomes a political football throw back and forth. It's not at this point in time what's best for bears ears, what's best for that national monument. It was best for, for it to be fairly owned. What's best for the people, the jobs, the place. It becomes what's best for each side and their rhetoric. And so president Trump asked secretary, former secretary of Interior Ryan Zinky to review, I think it was like 10 monuments to see if they should be reduced based on the predictions that Obama had put put into place. So he reviews these 10 monuments. He cuts out eight of them and hones in on two places, bears ears and grand staircase Escalante. They then say, we're going to reduce the size of these monuments. When you say cuts out eight of them, what do you mean by cuts out?

Speaker 2:          09:30          They review the other eight and say they're fine. They're good to go, no changes necessary. Okay. Some would say they did that as a, as a straw men as eight strawmen to knock them over and look at these other two. They said we will reduce the PR, the, the area that is designated as a national monument. And here again, it comes to both sides. They would say because President Obama wielded his powers corruptly to protect, to be as an environmentalist, to protect lands that didn't need protected under the antiquities act. Because the antiquities act does say it should be the smallest acreage possible to protect. So now you get into stuff that I'm not an expert in and around legal jargon and going back to things that were written in the 1930s but we get to a point where one side saying, here is the Republicans trying to shrink down these monuments so that they can then go the companies that are can then go and lease these places for mining, but they can't currently do on their protections as a national monument. The other side is saying, we're trying to protect culturally significant lands and these millions of acres need protected. They need protection for lots of reasons. So you end up with those two sides talking.
