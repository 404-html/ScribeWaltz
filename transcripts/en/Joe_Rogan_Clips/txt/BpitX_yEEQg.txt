Speaker 1:          00:00          Pan Out. I had a similar idea. Anthony Kumina were alive, sir. I love it. Joe Rogan. If it was not for you, oh my God, this, this would not exist. That which is insane. That is 100% actual fact. I was watching you doing live from the compound. Me and Brian Red Band. We're sitting in my fucking living room and we were watching you. You were fucking playing karaoke. You're singing karaoke with a machine gun in front of a green screen. I was like, this guy, this guy just set up his own studio like he already has opie and Anthony show. At the time you guys were at Sirius Xm and he just decided to do this thing and your basement just for a goof. Yeah. It was like a hobby, but it's like guys who don't have kids, married, not married, don't have kids, so I have anybody telling them what to do and they also have disposable income.

Speaker 1:          00:50          Then you get to see what guys really want to do. They want to sing karaoke with a machine gun in front of a green screen. Yeah. It was crazy. Crazy gun guy. Karaoke, so I could do that. If I was married, I would have a wife that would lose her mind at my living room. My living room table that you're supposed to have a candle on and little chotchkies and stuff is a widescreen, a computer monitor and a gaming system right next to the table. I have a gaming computer that's just unbelievable and I sit there and just play video games. So the table itself is a gaming monitor? Yeah, the whole tape. Well it's one of those touch screen ones. No, it's, it's a giant wide monitor. It's like a like 40 inches wide. So that's the table? No, it's on the table. The table is big, heavy metal thing, but it's just everything.

Speaker 1:          01:40          There's VR goggles up on the console by the TV. It's just a sensors around the room for the VR. It's a playground and you're absolutely right. Guys will spend their money on having fun if, if allowed to. That's what this place is. This place is insane. Joe's in my house. You go to my house, it's my wife's house. Say That's how it works. I have one elk head on the wall. That's all I have. That's all you're allowed. I laugh at guys and they have the, uh, the man cave. Like, dude, come on down to the man cave. The chicks aren't allowed down here. I got this, the TV that, and I'm like, no horror places. The whole house. She relegated you to one room and go and you're happy about it. You're happy that you got one room. Happy wife, happy life. That's apparently it didn't work.

Speaker 1:          02:27          It didn't work for me. You know that the row quote that I say way too many times in this podcast, but I love the quote. Most men live lives of silent desperation. Wow. Yeah, that is true. It's 100% true. It was, uh, I was married for a time and it was a, it was a nightmare. It was a living hell for me. The only thing that got me through as many years as I was married, because I was married nine years and I don't remember one happy year out of those nine, but I had gotten into radio pretty early on in that marriage. Um, and that was my life. So I dedicated myself no matter how miserable anything else in my life was. I was doing radio, so I thought it was awesome. I have a theory about that. I really do. I think that a person needs a certain amount of suffering in their life.

Speaker 1:          03:17          And if you look at some of the all time great comics, oh, or even all time great radio personalities, like Howard Stern, Howard stern during his hay day when he was, the fucking man was miserable. Right? Right. And he would talk about it. He would hide in his basement. I love those stories. You realize like, here's this guy. He's the, you know, the biggest radio personality ever. He's, he's huge. And yet he's got to hide and, and he's just talking about masturbating and hiding from his wife and you can't get any sex. And you'll like, it didn't matter if he was huge. It didn't matter if he was famous. Didn't matter how Richie was, it didn't matter. He's just hiding in the basement. And that anx came out on the radio like you related to him. You understood it. Yeah. Yeah. I get that. Um, and it worked for me because there was a lot of misery.

Speaker 1:          04:05          Like when I started, uh, doing really well, we moved back to New York from, from Boston after we got fired. [inaudible] opiod myself. You guys got fired for saying that the mayor died? Yeah, it was an April fool's gag. And, uh, because we always thought the, the radio April fool's jokes were so stupid and Hokey and uh, yeah, we changed the format to all Elvis and it's like after 10 minutes they say April fools. So we're like, let's just go balls out and say the mayor's dead and to have a news guy come on and report it and everything. And then it was supposed to subsequently get more outrageous as the, uh, the show went on. So by the end of it, there was a, uh, Taiwan male hooker in the car with them and they crashed because he was getting a blow job or stuff like it was going to get really ridiculous, but they stopped it early on and never allowed us to even mention it.

Speaker 1:          04:58          So people really thought he died. Although it's kind of stupid. You go to the ONA show for your news, but back then the internet wasn't what it is now. Exactly. Yeah. Dinner was it even it was barely a thing. It was barely a thing. Uh, cause that was 90, 97 around there. 98. What year did you get on? You'll probably early. I was on really early, like the 80s. I was on bulletin boards servers, uh, and uh, used to play Trivia Games with a 300 baud modem with people. And I thought it was amazing. Uh, even then and then in, in the, uh, when we were up in Boston, I bought a digital camera that was just this giant thing. And I had a laptop and other giant thing and uh, I would take pictures of what was going on in the studio and then post them that night on a website that I figured out.

Speaker 1:          05:50          I used to code the html myself and make a website just to post pictures and links and people thought it was amazing. Like you're seeing what we talked about that day. Uh, it wasn't instant, but it was pretty cold. And then I started doing videos. I was able to put video, like maybe eight second clips of nude girls if they were in the studio and pop that up and people loved it. Uh, and then I got a bill from the, the company for bandwidth and I didn't know bandwidth. It was a $12,000 bill for a month. Yeah. Yeah. Cause I, there was no, there was no compression or anything. I'm pumping video out to thousands of people on compressed. And uh, apparently, um, they had that happen a couple of times. So they told me just don't do it again. They didn't make me pay, which was pretty cool.

Speaker 1:          06:42          But at that point I had to learn about, you know, coding and a compression and things like that. So you just kept doing it and just, just put them in some sort of a compressed format. Yeah. Would you use, do you remember back then? Oh God, I think it was like a for audio. It was real audio, which was hilarious. Right. The little player, he'll play it. Real audio player would pop up. And then for video, God, I can't even remember what it was, but it was terrible. It was all pixelated, you know, like 10 frames per minute and kind of weird to things like real audio, which was everywhere. Just they just quit. Then they gave up around still, unless they changed into something else, you know, or kind of got bought out by somebody up. Yeah, yeah. That's happens to everything. But honestly, if it was not for you and your show live from the competent and for opiate, hilarious because opie and Anthony was the first radio show that I re what are wherever realize you don't really have to have a format.
