Speaker 1:          00:00          A lot of this early work was reported and there was no voucher specimens to document the collection. So a lot of it had to be dismissed, you know, uh, they, the Beta carbon chemistry of banisteriopsis didn't really get well defined until, um, some Chinese scientists, uh, or at least they have Chinese name worked on them and discovered harming tetra hydro harming and the harmer lien as the main alkaloids. They could reference that to botanical voucher specimens. So they really should get the credit for discovering it. And then once that was done, then it was known and you know, other scientists had to acknowledge that. Why did they describe it as telepathy? That there was supposedly some sort of a story about some group telepathic experience. Yeah. This was just romantic. This was just some story, you know, out of the literature. Um, yeah. I mean, I mean it, it was rumored to be able to cause telepathy, but this wasn't Iowasca they were only taking hormone.

Speaker 1:          01:11          It's not clear. It's not clear. It's not clear. Yeah. I mean they may have been taken but they may have been taking it. But whether they were getting telepathy, I kind of doubt it when we know we could get telepathy on Iowasca. It's not so uncommon. It happens all the time. People have group hallucinations, group visions. Has anybody ever bothered to independently legs a quest or people put them into like a different rooms, have them do Iowasca and then have them describe a very similar experience are almost identical experience to prove that these telepathic you experiences exist or at least to as far as I know that hasn't been done. See yeah cause everybody wants to talk afterwards. I do see the dragon. Right. I don't think that's been dug. That seems like a worthy study. Cause if, if I've heard from more than one person, in fact, my friend Kyle Kingsbury and his wife had an Iowasca experience with a, both had a visualization of their child and then when they got back she was pregnant and they want to having this child from their visualization from, from, from this experience.

Speaker 1:          02:25          Um, obviously they're very close and they were together and they probably communicated quite a bit. And you know, I would just think it'd be really interesting experiment. It would be very interesting. I mean, and that sort of points out there is, you know, a realm of experience, a realm of knowing that these things give access to that's normally close to us. I mean, that's kind of a trivial statement of course. Um, but then you get down to questions of how verifiable is that? How real is that? How, uh, you know, and, and people get, um, I don't know if the term is hung up, but they can get baffled when you start talking about, you know, the reality of say the entities you encounter on DMT. I mean, this is, this is, uh, some people I know are obsessed with trying to verify the reality of the entities that you find on DMT.

Speaker 1:          03:25          And again, it comes down to if you experience some, they're real. If anything you experienced as real because you've experienced it. Does it have a corresponding existence in the external world? Well, you know, what's external? What's internal? You know, we, we, we throw around these terms, these, these epistemological metaphysical terms quite carelessly, you know, without really thinking about it. What does it mean when you say I'm in here and you're out there, you know, and then you take a psychedelic and you realize that's an artificial boundary. You know, we're all one. There is no separation. It's separate in normal consciousness though it's separated in normal conscious. But then what is normal conscious if not a reflection of your neuro chemical, brain, state. I mean, everything you experience is an altered state because it's filtered into this brain processed by the brain and you know, the brain is a biochemical engine that, you know, as I say, often we're made out of drug.

Speaker 1:          04:33          So it seems that our normal consciousness is the best state to propagate biological life and to keep our s are whatever we've created in terms of our community structures and relationships and friendships and the ability to build structures and houses and things like that. These, all these things are done best when you're here and present, whereas when you're on a psychedelic state, I agree with you. Well, the way I've always described it as if you had a meeting with God and you went and God gave you all the answers to the world and you have, you experienced, uh, undeniable beauty in the most extreme form possible where you couldn't have imagined it and then you came back. Whether you hallucinate it or not, it's the exact same experience. Exactly. I can't put it on a scale. You can't weigh it like we've stretched the tape measure around and God is 47 inches across.

Speaker 1:          05:28          Like just because, you know what I'm saying? Just because you can't draw and measure it with what we term our, our, our, you know, our metrics for reality. Right. And that is exactly the, the thing. Don't worry about whether it's real and the way we would define real. Is it good information or is it bad air, is it not? That's the thing. It doesn't matter where it comes from. It's such a fits good information. Then it has its own internal validity. I'm whether it came from some part of yourself that is normally up security, you or a came from the plant teacher or the aliens transmitting it through. It doesn't really matter. But we, we are obsessed with that. We are specific reality because we think we're being fooled a lot. Right? Like the, and this goes back to Terrance's La Chorrera psychedelic experience where he had a Ufo encounter, you know, easily dismissing amongst us would go while he's tripping his balls off on mushrooms.

Speaker 1:          06:29          Of course I saw you. Oh, is there a leprechaun drive in the UFO? Like all that's nonsense, right? Right. Easy to dismiss. Yeah. And in fact, that is the nature of these phenomena. That's what's really interesting. Easy to dismiss that. That was another aspect of the experiment of the La Chorrera I left out when I was talking about my lecture. But there's almost always an element of absurdity in these experiences and the imperil normal experiences in Ufo encounters. It's like little green man. Are you kidding? But right the fuck there are little green man and little blue man.
