Speaker 1:          00:01          That's silly. And what would you do without the tourist? Yeah, you should. Uh, I think Roseanne's going to actually fucking make money off a macadamia nut farm. I think she's going to be out selling fucking nuts somewhere. Oh, she never, she never, I think I told you, she called me again and goes, I am, I'm ready to do Rogan. We've been going back and forth. Right. Well now she says she's gonna do her own podcast. We're going to do it. It's just going to take time. You know, I told, this is what I told her. She said, she contacted me the day says I'm ready to do it whenever you are. I said, you just tell me when and we'll do it. And then we're trying to figure out, I'm in Salt Lake City and I'm on, I understand house. There was a little bit of that and then, you know, she's just trying to figure out when's the right time.

Speaker 1:          00:47          But she said she wants to do her own youtube channel and she's, she's upset at everybody and, and I felt like, you know, she's, there's a lot of merit and what she's saying, you know, I really do think she got fucked over. I think, uh, I really do think she made a joke about a woman that she didn't know it was black and a woman who's, I think she's only one eighth black, right? Is that what she did? I saw the picture and I like, Oh, I get it now. She goes, not talked to her on the phone afterwards or she goes, she was asking me for advice and she said I, I really fucked up. And I honestly didn't think she was black. And then she goes, did you ever deal ambien? I go, that's exactly why I stopped doing ambien. And I'm sure that's why she tweeted that.

Speaker 1:          01:34          Where I like to just talk about this on Rogan Cause Rogan spends time, you can explain stuff. Stop fucking tweeting. Tweet where she goes, hell I did take an ambien. Yeah, you drink on Ambien and your fuck. I can tell you a million stories of normal people like fucking, you know Judy Brown, her husband, Steve Marmel almost had a plane grounded cause he on a flight, he took an Ambien and had a couple of bourbons and then just started going fucking batch. It has no recollection of it and I've done stuff that was like minor where I just had a very lucid business conversation with Hannigan after I'd taken an Ambien on my, like a light night of drinking for me, which six or seven beers and I went to bed and then I get get up 15 minutes later and went out and had this very lucid business conversation that I don't remember it all and I brought it up to him the next day.

Speaker 1:          02:30          Something we were going to talk about. He goes, we've talked about this last night. He's like, yes, you came out. I go, no, I went to bed. But what you came out shortly after you seem to vary like completely normal. Wow. Kevin James, uh, uh, he made dinner. He, uh, went downstairs, made his own dinner, cooked it, ate it, went back to bed, got up in the morning and was like, who the fuck cooked? Yeah. And then they're there like you did. He's like, no, I didn't. He goes like, no. Yeah, you did look, hey, you throw this away like you, you cook this. Like what the fuck are you talking to his brother? You remember my ax Renee, her brother and his buddy took some ambience, had a minor amounts of cocktails, woke up on a lawn in a neighborhood they didn't know where they were geniuses and that's where it was that one lucid business conversation where you go, that could have been me driving my car into someone's front fucking porch. So yeah, I s I s I swore it off. My Mom said that she took it and uh, no booze, just took the Ambien and wound up drawing on a, a bathroom, a carpet, you know, in the little bathroom rugs, just drawing on it with like lipstick and, and nail Polish doesn't have any recollection of doing it. Just drawing on it like a little kid would, would they pull out the nail Polish? Just start.

Speaker 1:          03:57          That's a weird thing. It's called a hypnotic, that's what they, they call that, that category of drugs. The other thing with Roseanne is like she, well she got serious mental illness and she's on a bunch of different medications. Well she's got legit multiple personality disorder. She's talked about it and I don't think they call it multiple personality disorder anymore. I think they have a new name for it, but it's just a noise. Rebranding fucking mental illnesses like come on man. It's like this is what it is. It is multiple personality disorder. She has a bunch of different people and you know, if you talked to people that had been around her and see or switch from personality to personality, you realize like, Oh and you know a lot of this also came from head trauma. She's one of several comedians that became a different person because of head trauma.

Speaker 1:          04:47          I think she was hit by a car as well. Sam Kennison, same thing. Hit by a car and also she was in a car accident. I don't, I don't know if it was child molestation or rape and disassociative identity disorder. That's what they're calling it now. And she also can't fucking tell the difference between Twitter and a green room because if every single comic like was recorded, the dark shit that we say in green rooms, because we're comics and we say the worst possible thing, especially to make each other laugh cause you go to the darkest areas and you say all the wrong words and you say the most racist thing to your black comic friend and he says the fucking worst thing to you about your fucking ugly fucking teeth or you're fat or you're fucking stupid. And if she walked into the green room and said that about that lady, we would be laughing, right?

Speaker 1:          05:44          We'd be laughing. Especially if we know who she was. I didn't know actually saying something racist. You'd look at the picture and go, I don't get it. I had no understanding of who that woman was. I never had heard of it until Roseanne got fired. And I was like, who is this lady? And she's saying she's the Muslim Brotherhood. And then Roseanne said, did she thought she was Jewish? I was like, okay, if you think she was black, I thought she was Jewish. And then I wa I looked at the picture. I go, all right, well yeah, the fucking, that's a, that's not a cut and dry one. If you read two years of Roseanne's tweets, that would not be the one that stood out as if she just says fucking insane stuff. That makes no sense all the time. Did she say that Susan Rice, she said she was a, a great big, uh, uh, big ape with no a man. Oh, she's a man with giant swinging eight balls.

Speaker 1:          06:45          This was like five years ago and then five years later they give her that said common can't believe she's acting crazy. That's I completely fault ABC seen a fucking cash cow that nope, they, they thought they could handle or hey, we can make a lot of money by giving a toddler a pistol. We know what else she said. She felt like she has promised not to. What? She's selfish. She felt like she was being removed from the creative process too. Like there was a bunch of things going on even before this and that this was like one of the final steps, but that they were, she was having a hard time with the whole process and she was definitely having a hard time with being overworked. She's like [inaudible] out about the Illuminati and Zion is, maybe we should get you out of the writer's room.

Speaker 1:          07:31          Would not, wouldn't be a bad idea to do an episode about her thinking that everything is the Illuminati mean that's fucking gold comedy there. There's so much there. I had explained to her chem trails like, but the thing is different than anybody that I've ever talked to about these kind of wacky conspiracy theories. When I explained to her what, what, how those clouds are made, she went, oh, okay. She just let it go. Like most of them don't fucking let it go. If you tell them that, well, you see those planes, they're spraying overhead and you go, no, no, no. It's the heat of the engine, the condensation and the atmosphere. It's actually creating a cloud. It's just the water vapor and mixes with the heat. Of this engine. It makes clouds. It's all it is. Roseanne discos. Okay. Like just let it go like everybody else, like bullshit, man. There's fucking documents. There's papers. The CIA's admitted it. It's one of the hardest things in the world when you get a stupid conspiracy theory in your head. It's one of the hardest things the world is to just go, oh, that might people shit.
