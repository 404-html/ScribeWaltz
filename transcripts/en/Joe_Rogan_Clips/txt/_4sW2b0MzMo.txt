Speaker 1:          00:00          Well for going to come after you. How dirty is that money exactly. It must be in a safe and it wasn't just the safe. Only in the storage unit. Oh, that's gotta be something bad. And you get that handsome dude that was in the beginning of Ozarks. That handsome Mexican dude. It's just a straight up murder. He's going to come visit you all. Oh Man. That guy was my favorite. I was so sad when they spoil spoiler. So sad when they killed him. Like the dude from breaking bad. That comes around twins. But did you see Ozark? You ever see Ozark? I watched like the first couple episodes and I fucked it up for you. Yeah, cause it was a pivotal moment that I just gave voice to many. There's so many shows though. There are so many shows. But that's a damn good one. Is it good?

Speaker 1:          00:38          That is a damn good show. What's the guy that's the guy who starts in that? Jason Bateman Bateman. He's excellent. And the woman Laura Linney Linney. She's amazing. Yeah, the family's amazing kids. Amazing. It's fucking show, man. It's a show. It's like, nope, you get sucked in and that Netflix lets you watch them all. Like, are you ready? Listen, let me ask you a question I asked a lot of people is and I said to set up a Christmas party and I got with a bunch of hunters and I got a couple like the stink eye. Like what's this guy talking to? Conservatives. I don't know if that, maybe I'm just weird. Have you ever seen the movie the greatest showman? Oh, is that the, um, the musical? It is. I've been forced to watch segments of that with my wife and children. It is fantastic. Very good movie.

Speaker 1:          01:23          Hugh Jackman's in angel. He's an angel and Australian Angel. He is. He sent down here to save us. Save us. You ever seen him dance and sing? He's made, he's magical. I'm a hunter. I got a hunting podcast. But I'm telling you, you're a manly man. Look at that beard. Yeah, we got this thing. But I love that movie. It's a great movie. I listened to it on the Pandora, the greatest showman channel and I sing the tunes. Listen did my favorite comedy on TV is the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Okay. So I can't be talking about man. Look, things are not in manly things. Hugh Jackman Perform Announces World Tour set to perform the greatest showman songs. He's going to just sit and look at him. Look at him. Wow. One man show. Gorgeous man. He's just, I mean it's unbelievable. Unbelievable. But yeah, I did. I get, I get made fun of for this.

Speaker 1:          02:07          My, of course, my son likes it. My wife likes it, but I enjoy, I get into like your son, how old is he? He's too, he doesn't know any better. We just like the music [inaudible] something's going on. Yeah. He's just like, there's something on the TV. He's not like a crazy, he's not writing that critique APP. But if you put on Dora the explorer and then you switched it over to that bullshit, he believes this fucking guy dancing. No, he'll be Dora. Dora. Yeah. Listen, I think that I watch like if you watch things like game of Thrones where they are burning children. Yeah. And like it's entertaining, but sometimes I need a break. I like to watch a man dance around and sing for a woman, whatever. It don't matter. Those move those shows can get dark where you're like, what am I doing to myself?

Speaker 1:          02:45          You know, like narcos. Oh yeah. And they would just go into a fucking nightclub and gun people down just sitting there and watching like women and children smoked. And it's, it's, what's the other, the show with Anthony Hopkins on Hbo. What's that? The robots. Oh, Westworld. Yeah. That's the same way they're shooting kids on there though. Well, the kids are robot. We can just path. Yeah, they shot one right in the face every once in a while. You need to sprinkle a little bit of musical and your life, I believe. Yeah. What is that do you think? And here's the come coming from a person that's been on a bunch of life changing experiences. And I know you have, I want to talk to you about some them. Yes. Especially the one in Nepal where you almost died and you saw children and wolves, babies. We talked about that on the last podcast, but it's probably, it would be worth revisiting.

Speaker 1:          03:28          Um, what do you think this is? Like why, why are we so obsessed with life or death drama that's artificial. Well you see it like in the, in the, in the show Westworld they talk about like it being a game. Yeah. It being this game of access. Like what can't I do in my real life? Right? So when you watch TV and you watch murdering and you watch this, this evil thing come to life, you're just, you're, it's, it really is something that you can be transported, can't do that in your regular life. For sure. With Westworld, what you're getting is basically a real live version of that red dead redemption. Yes. Right. So when you, when you play that, we were talking about the other day, how this guy got in trouble because they have all these things in the game that you can do to people.

Speaker 1:          04:13          And this guy like ty this hook her up, threw her off a cliff and shit and you can start can, you can do whatever you want. But they were, they were filming this stuff and putting it on youtube and then youtube would get mad and youtube pulled him off. But then people are like, well, wait a minute though. Why? How come? You can just do it like, why'd you have that in the game? But it did when my dad was my age, 30 40 years ago, there would, they would never have ever does nothing done anything like game of Thrones or Westworld ever. Ever. In fact, there was a Westworld and it wasn't anywhere near like it is. You'll bring modern day. Good moving. Yeah. But like I think we've just stretched out the limits to which we're willing to explore, like really terrible and evil things for entertainment.

Speaker 1:          04:58          We've definitely changed what we're willing to accept and where the bar is in terms of quality, the bars through the roof, through the roof. It's immersive to the point where you can't even like, I can't even explain what you're experiencing when you're watching these shows. Yeah. So look, if you go and you see some great comedy from the 1990s like you see watch a Dave Chappelle or Chris rock specials from the 90s that holds up 100% and Seinfeld that. But what I'm saying is like if that was out today, it would be a 100% standup special. I'd be like, oh you see the new Chris Rock's bigger and blacker, it's fucking amazing. But if you tried to put some bullshit ass 1990s TV show on on Netflix, if you tried to like finagle some CSI Miami type Shit, you know what I mean? Some nonsense. I don't know if CSI Miami, is that even a show?

Speaker 1:          05:57          Is that a real show? There's a CSI Miami. There is. There's several. There's many CSI I guessed, but we'd like, we don't order law and order. There's so many of those, but we've expanded our willingness to like explore things that are, I mean game of Thrones for example. It's one of the best shows ever created in my opinion for sure. But it explores some unthinkable things. Awful, awful things. Well, it's the whole show, but spoiler alert is, uh, around a brother and sister were fucked and had a whole family. Yeah. Yeah. So we didn't explore these like these things that in we would never even touch upon in our media in the fifties, sixties, even the 70s, we would be touching upon those things in a way that we do now. No, not only that, but here's the thing, law and orders on a bad show. Like if you watch it, you'll be in a, nope.

Speaker 1:          06:46          So what happened? Why, why do we go not good enough? Like what, what was it? Was it, did they go not good enough or did, was it like, like porn? Like if you watch porn, okay. And you watch some porn from the 1980s and then you flipped through like youporn now that I would ever do that. But if you did do that and looked at all the different categories, you'd be like, what the fuck happened? Yeah. Like why are people, why is gagging something people are looking for? It's not, it's not an, it's like a category. We've expanded our ability to conceive of things. Yes. In immediate space where we can create, you can create dragons that breathe ice. You can create. Yeah, there's, there's things you can be transported, like, listen, this isn't real so I can, I can do this, right? I can have this scene of, of rape or infidelity or are incest that seems it's appropriate to me only in this fantasy world, man.

Speaker 1:          07:43          Sometimes I get down on that stuff like a watch. Enough of it. You're just like, I need a musical. I need to be inspired. That life is grand and that's how I feel about it, man. And sometimes it comes across and like this dude washes musicals, but I, I do for a little bit of a break. Nothing wrong with it. What I'm weirded out about is this natural human inclination towards progression in everything good or bad is that things just keep ramping up well, but we're progressing with our storylines for like humanity in a weird way in media. But we're also like suppressing a lot of our, we're trying to suppress through social justice a lot of the same thing, right? Well, some people are, but I think it's a small, very vocal minority. I think in reality there's, the vast majority of people find out about said suppression or upset by it and they're like, what in the fuck are you talking about with this safe spaces and all this nonsense.

Speaker 1:          08:35          Most people that hear that stuff are going, oh, this is just nonsense by a few like really loud device types. Even though my pocket has, it's something like as serious as hunting is because you're killing stuff like that's going out into the world and taking plucking something that you didn't put there, taking it away. But like I think that the core of what I think you do well and what I think others should try to do is ask why, why are we willing to, why is game of Thrones the most watched show that's on right? Why? Why, why? I can't answer that question, but it's a conversation because it's, if it's so fictitious, right? It's so obviously fiction. You're living in this fictional world. You have fictional white walkers, you have dragons, you have people that can survive in fire, but there's parallels to real life and then these, these ridiculous fantasies, but then these parallels to real life that that travel along the same path and like you don't get to choose between the dragons and the incest.

Speaker 1:          09:38          Yeah. Both there at the same time. I think it, it fulfills a lot of like base needs, but it does. So in this way, that's obviously false. Yeah. It's like why are superheroes so huge to us? If you stop and think about the number of blockbusters that are superhero movies that are comic book movies, they're coming out like once every couple of months now. Crazy. The, that was a rare beast when I was at chess when I was a kid. If there's a hulk movie, I have jumped for joy. It was no god Damn Spiderman movie when I was a kid. There was a TV show and it's sucked. Okay. Was the God damn cartoon TV show Spiderman? Spiderman does whatever's a spider spins a web, any size catches these just like flies. Look, ouch. There comes a spider man. It was terrible. And I used to get up early to watch it cause I was a huge comic book.

Speaker 1:          10:33          You've watched the Lou Ferrigno Hawk, right? Fuck yeah, I watched it. That was a little bit, I mean like you've watched the Batman with Adam West. Yeah. You watch him now and you're like, what is happening? So they came out with Superman. He was like the first movies that, what does this Spiderman, a TV show. Wow. That's another TV show guy in the back of was I kind of the background doing, who's that guy? He don't look, you don't do anything good. It's got a wooden stick. He needs to know those [inaudible] Spiderman can shoot webs out of his hands and that wouldn't sticks. Probably not going to do much then. Then Spiderman sorta changes ability. Right? Because we, it used to be able to do, like now he could just basically fly. I mean just hurls himself through the air and sticks to buildings. You know, he used to be a little harder to swing around back. I like, let me drop my backpack full of textbooks, get to it. But he's, that was, there was no Spiderman movies when I was a kid, and there was a superman movie and the superman movie beget the Batman movie. Batman movie came out, Michael Keaton. It was a big, big success. People were shocked at Michael Keaton was Batman, but it worked. Was that like Danny Devito was the penguin? Yeah. Everybody got a shot at Batman.
