Speaker 1:          00:00          The Republican's and hate for Trump in particular, ramps up and that they're really worried that there'll be some sort of a violent outbreak between the right and the left and that this could actually really happen. Man, it's not impossible. It's not impossible that at least battles could break out because people are fucking polarized, Matt. Yeah. Yeah. But I think what's interesting to me is that more and more people, it seems like, at least from my perspective on the right, are now coming out against Trump. It seems more common, more common, especially with this government shutdown people like what the fuck? You know, there's so many videos of people going, what are you talking about? What this wall like? We need money. Like people, it's government people. A lot of them are living check to check. Yeah. You're shutting down their pit. This is the only way you can negotiate this wall.

Speaker 1:          00:49          Does the only way you can fund this wall. This is crazy. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's, I don't know. I mean, people always say the government sucks. Fucking shut it down and then it shuts down. Everybody gets mad. You know? It's, it's makes an argument that the government should be doing less things. This is the real argument. The argument is some of those things that the government does. Why does the government have to do it? Why can't it be privatized? Why, why can't it become a business? It would probably run better if some of those things we're not run by the government like airport security or like road maintenance or like a lot of other things like don't have the government do it, have private contractors do it. Cause I'm really strong standards and, and strong competition and uh, John Stossel actually has a video about it right now.

Speaker 1:          01:43          Um, it's on his Twitter page. It's a long video. But explaining how one of the things people are realizing from this government shutdown is that the government does a lot of things that they don't have to do. It would be probably better for everybody if some of these things were streamlined. Some of these things were done by the private sector. I don't think that's a bad idea. I think there's a lot of things that could be done better if there was competition as soon as the government controls certain businesses. I mean, maybe they do it really well and maybe they don't. You know, I think the, I think there's certain things that were, socialism works really well. Like, here's one fire department. Fucking you gotta pay for the Fire Department. Everybody wants to fund the fire department. Don't you cut the fire budget, man, what if my granny house and we once fire man, we gotta pay for the Fire Department.

Speaker 1:          02:36          Pay For that shit. Pay for the police. Yup. Pay. And everybody says pay you shouldn't be rich. People only get cops and poor people don't get comps. That's crazy. Everyone would say that's crazy. Yeah. Right. Well why is that not the case with education to them? Well, right. Don't you want people to learn things? Like when, when did education becomes such a big business? Why is that a business? It should be our goal as patriots, right? To make less losers, more happy, successful people. More aware people, more educated people, you know. But instead it's like subsidized by the government and that makes it even weirder. And then you have student loans you can't escape. Yeah. A lot of that is pretty bizarre. It's bizarre is fuck, it should be free. But there's also like there's another like a lot, some people don't want to do anything.

Speaker 1:          03:21          They does true want to be alive and they just, they just, they don't want to contribute and really have any sort of life and they have no desire for that. And there's generation and generation and generation of them dead is true. But what if you ever, do you ever look at universal basic income? It's a weird idea. I flatly rejected it when I first heard it. We have it. No, we don't have it. They've tried it out in a couple of places, but I don't think it's really worked out that well. But the idea behind it, I'm having a guy who comes on soon, his name is Andrew Yang, is a proponent of universal basic income. And the idea is you give people x amount of dollars per month, whether it's $1,000 per month and everybody gets it no matter what. And by doing that, you take care of all of the burden of survival.

Speaker 1:          04:10          Like we take care of everyone in the civilization. Everyone gets food, everyone gets shelter. So that eliminates a lot of crime and a lot of strife just right away, right? Questions more laid back. Where's all that money come from? There's $1,000 a month. 308 million. Is that what it was? Plus, you know, that was 2010 it's probably more now let's slate. Let's say three 20 that is a lot of money. 320 million thousand. So that's 320 billion. Gee, isn't that what it is? I have no clue. And the 320 billion a month when that would be the, if you gave a thousand people $1 million, isn't that what it would be? A thousand million is a billion, right? Just to it in the calculator, Bro. Don't do it in your head. A thousand a million. Yeah. So that's right. So it must be so that that's so much money. So three. So the, the wall, like him talking about building a wall, isn't he asking for 5 billion? Five Dale. Okay. It's not that much, I don't think. Well, that's to build a wall once. This is every month, you would need all those billions. That's all a lot of fucking Chadha. And so that means everybody would have their basic needs met. Yes. Everybody get 1000 bucks where that money comes from. This is what I need to talk to this guy about. Obviously I'm not a mathematician or any sort of an economist, so I don't have any idea what they've, how they feel like they can do that.
