Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. What I wanted to talk to you guys about is, uh, some of my favorite stuff that you've done. Um, and so my favorite stuff that you've done is the undercover shit. And one of the things that I've found the most disturbing was when you posed as a gay couple and you went to that place where they were advocating transgender children and transitioning children as young as three years old, three years old, but puberty blockers they were talking about. But I think it was really fucking yet. Oh, no, no. You know what, actually three years old was Owen Benjamin gotten an argument on Twitter and lost his manager because he was saying that someone is fucking insane for giving puberty blockers to a three year old kid for giving hormone blockers to a baby, which I am. Fuck yeah. That's not even a strong enough word.

Speaker 1:          00:47          I mean, it's insanity. Fucking insanity. I mean, you're, your body's not even developed. You're not even close. We're not talking about 18. We're not even talking about 21, which is arguable is still crazy. Like you really should probably wait until your fucking frontal cortex fully developed. You figure out who you are, but the idea that you're going to know at three, who are you going to be when you're 30 well, they present the other side. Banana. They act as though you're crazy. No one said. They were like, well, you know the things with the puberty when we're that person looked like Smi with looked like SMI from hook. Well let's play with, let's lay some of it because it's, it's fucking nuts. When I watched it, I was like, oh my God. Like what are these people saying? And the there've been taken down since you asked me about that to really?

Speaker 1:          01:26          Yeah, we have to set the blur. The Guy, well, I'm not afraid who checkerspot drugs. Dr Rex, but who shows up in price name? My name is regs, but diarrhea. We have a business card. Real world. We're in a goddamn simulation. This was a town hall. We're in a simulation. This can't be real guy. His name is rex. But, and he got to the dig for a living, you know, and you do back to back. Yes. Okay. Let's play some of this. And if there's a w for most of the people are listening rather than watching Jerry, do you know what, let's set this up and turn. So what was this? Okay. Uh, it was, well not gay, Jared and I, so here's the one, let me, can I preface this with some again, we don't like, we're not undercover journalists, right? We do a late night show.

Speaker 1:          02:12          That's what we do. We do, we did the modeling. Would you joke sketches and we do interviews and then every now and then we stumbled across something. And when you're doing, for example, like Antifa and they hand you a knife and they talk about shooting. Been talking about that too. But the point is, and then when the media just lies about it, like we feel compelled to, this isn't our thing, right? It's just this is what this particular one was kind of a throwaway. It was a throat. We were joking. It was a goof. It was costumes. If you just walked in separate queer, it was what? The health care, transgender town hall. We was like, oh my gosh. Trans Gender, town hall, transgendered. Tom. Where was it at? Vermont. Vermont. Burlington, Vermont. That place is crazy. I wasn't a plane with Bernie Sanders on the way there to wow. It was, it was Kimmy. I'm on money. I'm going to give it to the blacks, the blacks blocks. Right. That's fine. All right. He's about six now. He has said that

Speaker 2:          03:06          it feels like a girl or first playing with dolls and of course we don't want to discourage it. Um, we spoke with our primary care physician. He said, wait until the, the boys fully developed. Develop is a little thick. That's me. I would say a little bit from the research I've done the kid 18th too late. It was just like, okay, get rid of the poke. Puberty blockers. They just go through late puberty. Everything still lined up. There's no indication that there's any dance. That's not true. Puberty blockers are not reversible. That's the entire point. That's not the point. Top of it. And, uh, someone at the pre adolescent age going into those adulent it's going to change the way your body,

Speaker 1:          03:52          no question at all. I mean there's no way giving a kid a puberty blocker, letting them go through life with a puberty blocker and then at 17 or whatever the fuck it is decided to take that shit off. You're going to be the exact same human being you would have been without. People were worried about a little estrogen and milk cartons and this guy saying, hey, free plastic cause I don't want it to ultra my hormones. By the way, I'm going to chop off my balls and do puberty blockers at eight. But this is, I mean you can't, you can't let a kid make those decisions. You can't make those decisions for a kid. They're too young. He just remember he had a wiener five minutes ago. Yeah. Was I thinking about these things? No, no. He's just fine. His book or off on the couch three minutes ago and now you're letting them decide is hormonal profile the idea that a child who's six years old or whatever would know the consequences, but them saying that 18 is too late and that it's not that they would disagree with your primary care physician, that it's too young based on the research that I've done.

Speaker 1:          04:46          What fucking research have you done? What you, you can clearly point that it's a good idea to transition a six year old. Well here that's a problem. Here's another problem. We don't know if youtube is going to ban this video because of what you just said. [inaudible] t you this video is going to get marked for demonetization. Well, yeah, the, the Jordan Peterson one just got flagged and we talked about this book. We talked about uh, the 12 rules for life. We talked about, uh, guidelines for living a hell just reading it. That's great book. Let's keep going

Speaker 2:          05:16          to understand themselves and the task or reach a particular day length and the diameter and the penis is developing up. Then there'll be enough if, if, if you're going to check, if you're going to transition to it away material.

Speaker 1:          05:31          Oh cause that's a problem. I be like, you know, jazz material, creative vagina. If the testicles and the peanuts are developed enough, did you know this? Did you know that unless your penis gets big enough, you can't get a fake vagina because there's not enough tissue to in. So he's like, this is him. He's like, no. If you decide to transition the other way, meaning if you decide to not transition, eat. Remember how everyone made fun of this? Uh, the beauty pageant girl, when she was asked about gay marriage, she's like, and then, and gay marriage or opposite marriage and everyone laughed and it was silly. You know what I mean? She was conservative. It was silly. But he's doing that right here. Like should you choose to transition or transition the other way? You mean should you choose to not cut off your penis?

Speaker 1:          06:09          That's transitioned the other way. Now, not only that, there's a lot of people in the transgender community. I think it's offensive to assume that you have to get an operation, get your penis removed, nor to be transgender. And what some of those guys making this big assumption that this is what you have to do in order to transition. I know a lot of people that are transgender that do not have the operation. I don't know a lot of people. I just say I'm in a community focus groups with transgender people. By the way, let me say I'm 100% in favor of grown adults deciding to transition. I don't know. I think you should have be able to tattoo your face. Get nose rings. I don't give a fuck what you do. I really don't. I mean, you're also asking the government to pay for your face tattooed.

Speaker 1:          06:46          Yes, that's true. Well, and there was another thing here. I'll, I'll send this to you, Jamie. Um, that was some research today that someone put out here. I'll play this and I'll, I'll forward this to Jamie. I'll Texas to keep playing. That's it. That's it. That's that clip. I Dunno. But yeah, I mean that was the thing is, that's a good example. It's a public town hall, which we attend and it gets removed from youtube because someone who handed us his business card, rex, but business card Arius, by the way, like we didn't eat the rest of us. We weren't nearly as mad about this as we were just, just, just in, in doubled over in laughter at the guy's name is rex. I had trouble getting less secure in the URL, writes do his own nation. There was a gun politely to her website and you run a have to go to the URL.

Speaker 1:          07:32          Yeah, I just sent this to you, Jamie. If you follow the tweet. Um, it is, uh, by Dr Deborah. So, and uh, it is, um, uh, article, uh, from the National Institute of Health Study, Dr Zero van meter, a pediatric. Oh, okay. Oh, well, she's anti all this. They don't give any leeway to Asians. I, it's the minority group that they actually get more crap. It's like, well, you're up. You have to be better than everyone to get into a good college, to just so many. Really good ones. Okay. A doctor, Q van meter, a pediatric endocrinologist with extensive experience in gender dysphoria, which by the way is hate speech says there is 0.0 evidence that the concepts of gender fluidity and gender identity have any scientific basis. Yeah. So um, this is why she includes 0.0 that's the second zero there. She's money thinking about cash. Does it mean anything?

Speaker 1:          08:29          She's thinking about cash money. Well, I guess you could have 0.01% you could have one 100 she wanted to make sure there's no doubt. Yeah, she started in those extra characters. You've just got your house Bro. She's very, the extra two 40 characters you say like hate speech, gender dysphoria is still in the DSM five the actual like the psychiatric journal and the use of reference book, but they literally call it hate speech now. Yeah, I know, but it's the actual medical condition. What's crazy that undercover, God bless my wife, she went with us because we need other people to have hidden cameras and so she posed as a lesbian movie kind of lesbian. You're like, really? You exist and like, Eh, she's taking even how the fool they were, they couldn't say anything. Well she remember said like I feel I identify as someone with bigger breasts and she was asking how to get this covered under Medicare, medicaid cause they were talking about getting all these operations and in Mr Rec, God bless him Dr. Brooks, but I think we should mention that, you know, talk about that.

Speaker 1:          09:21          Gender dysphoria. So for her they use gender dysphoria to try and file it medically to get new tickets on the taxpayer dime. But it's considered hate speech to say it to the train and the transgenders in the room. It's just crazy. Like you can't make sense of it and I don't need to make sense of it. I just need to not be banned for dot. Want to be the woman she was meant to be. Right. Well I mean anything that you can mock is bullshit. I mean if you can mock it that openly, if that's that obvious, like getting the point of getting bigger tits because you identify as someone with bigger tits. I mean that's bullshit. That's why it's so funny. I've don't think I've ever been more in love with my wife then when she did that, I wouldn't expect that she's looking at me.

Speaker 1:          09:56          She kind of not identified as someone who has bigger breasts. Well, did you see that guy that got busted, uh, molesting children and said he identifies it being a six year old boy, that was a really recent case. I mean, people are trying this out when they get caught doing things, and I'm not saying that there's not people out there that identify with being a man when they're actually a woman or vice versa. That's not what I'm saying, but what I'm saying is there's all a lot of fucking crazy people out there a lot. And to deny that and just because it's dealing with gender, you're, you're in. We're in Narnia now. We're in Lala land. You're, you're not being real. No. Well, let me, let me ask you this, because like you said, you're, you're not right wing. I'm pretty open about the fact that I'm right wing.

Speaker 1:          10:35          I remember watching your show a while back and you had a little little guy, little guy, Jamie Kelsey, a buck, buck angel. Yeah. Little guy that used to be a gal. Yes. Yeah, exactly. And then I don't know what I said, but at the same kind of conversation we have here, like I don't just go out and look at the school, you you're training. I said why don't I just don't buy it. And he, he, he wanted to get into a fight with me. You wanted to have a fight. Let's fight him out of this. This was years ago when you had a fresh shot, a test jacked. But you know it's huge at one time. Oh was he? Oh yeah. It got up to like one 85 like super jacked cause just banging test in there and fucking lifting. But he was saying that his joints hurt really bad when he was doing that.

Speaker 1:          11:15          It's almost like, it's unnatural, so crazy. But back then when you get them on jacked jacked and I had a role with that guy, I'd be like fuck it. Go. No, come on. And you wouldn't have problem with that. That'd be kind of, yes. Yes, exactly what the point is back then. Let me ask you this. Did you realize it was gonna get us insane? Like where did you just think of the tunnel? This is an interesting guest. Well, he's a nice guy and you know, I, I'm more than willing to call him a man. And that was one of the things that I said. I said, look man, you're a person, um, who, whatever your name is with its buck or Fred or Wilma, I don't care. I just, whatever you want to be called, I'll call you whatever noise that you connect with you as a being.

Speaker 1:          11:55          Yeah, I'm fine with that. And if you can explain to me where you feel happier being a man, I'm 100% in support of you doing that. What drives me crazy is people making decisions for six year olds, people pushing six year olds in certain directions. And I know that this does happen. I know and I, I can't get too personal about this, but I have a friend who has an ex wife that turned his child into a girl. Yeah. And, and like tried this and was, was pushing this and kids are very fucking pliable man. This is not, I mean maybe some boys would have rejected it and maybe he was leaning that way anyway, but she was excited about it. And this is, this is something that a lot of people are excited. I mean, we're talking about a 14 year old, I mean, I just don't think you know who the fuck you are.

Speaker 1:          12:45          You know what is that girl's name? Ruby rose. Is that her name? The attractive a lesbian with the tattoos. She said that when she was young she wanted to transition and she's very happy that she didn't, she wanted to become a man and she's very happy that she didn't. And she's a lesbian and she's happy and she's open and super successful. But she's advocating the sorta the same thing that I'm saying. It's like let people become a God damn adult and then make these in, in alterable life. Changing decisions. This guy saying that hormone blockers can be turned off and then you could go through a normal puberty. You're out of your fucking mind. Right. I'm not a doctor, but I have enough understanding of biology to know that. That's crazy. That's just not true. No, it's absolutely not true. And that's one of those things is, listen, anyone can get lost in the weeds and make someone look stupid.

Speaker 1:          13:30          Something specific, you know, whether it's, it's, I mean, you were showing me that compound both there. It's fascinating. I don't know anything about it. I'm going to be a moron. You know, less than room temperature Iq. Some doctor can come in who's pro transgender and explain something and make it sound like we don't know what we're talking about. So when it comes to that, see, I don't, I don't agree with you there. Well, I don't agree with you on their terms. We wouldn't know. Right? Doesn't matter. What terms are there that you don't know about a child's biological development? Well they, what they point to the, well actually there are these studies that showed up the, you know, the, uh, the brain alterations occur before, across a hormone sex replacement therapy. And it's actually, it's not true. So we had a few transgender people on our show, but the point is with these, whether it's a conspiracy or, or that you'd say, okay, I'm not a doctor, but I can't just appeal to authority.

Speaker 1:          14:10          I can't just say this doctor says x. So I do have to at this point accepting that I'm not a doctor except the preponderance of evidence from the overall medical community. And combine that with the anecdotal and combined that with, is there a motive here? Is there an agenda here? Like a lot of conspiracy theories and just doesn't add up because who benefits from telling you, you know, the world is flat, who benefits from it? Now I can understand how someone might benefit from a conspiracy was like, oh, they make a lot of money off of this. Or was it Tim Kennedy as a hunting Hitler thing? I'm not saying it, but it's like, okay, I understand. After a war they thought maybe they had Hitler and they needed the healing for the country. Go, okay, I can understand that. But with this, there's, there's, it just doesn't add up to none of the arguments they at ups for

Speaker 3:          14:52          millennial parents to whack off turning the age of their children to social experiments. It's okay.
