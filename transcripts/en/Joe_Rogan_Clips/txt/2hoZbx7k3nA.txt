Speaker 1:          00:00          Like this is, okay, this is the tonight show your Carson, but we figured out a way, Carson. Now, do you know that? Right? That's the difference. That's the shift. That's why Netflix can't even compete. Netflix has done, they're not done done. What are you talking about? You see Charlie Wilson's war, no movie about Tom Hanks movie about America getting an evolved with the Afghan conflict and Afghanistan board doesn't really matter, but the idea is this. They're fighting the Russians, the Afghanis, right? So the Americans go, okay, boom, give them a $5,000 rocket launcher and they're going to shoot down a $5 million helicopter and eventually Russia just won't be able to compete, right? Netflix pays $100 million to Aaron Sorkin or whoever to make a TV show, right? Right. That distracts you for two hours, right? Youtube pays zero million dollars to Joe Rogan and Jamie to make a podcast that distracts you for two hours every day.

Speaker 1:          00:58          Netflix cannot compete, but it's a different animal. You got to realize, first of all, they have way more people than just me. They also are putting together something that requires a lot of money to create. Sure. You enjoy films or if you enjoy a show like Ozar, sure. Stranger things long for narrative. It takes a lot of money to make those things are special effects. There's camera people and makeup people in here. There's a lot of lock on our writers and directors and producers and actors and he'd say giant fucking tense filled with people. People aren't watching it. You know what they're watching? People are watching them. They're watching friends. No, no, no, no. Not 10 free. Dude. There's a reason they paid us terrible bro. It doesn't matter if it's terrible as Jamie two most viewed shows on Netflix right now. Netflix doesn't own, okay.

Speaker 1:          01:42          Netflix isn't even trying to make money anymore. They're getting bought out. It's Facebook. Uh, Amazon. Do they want it? That's the goal of the strategy. Now, the 10 billion in debt, there's no way they can make money. There's 10 billion billion Billy and, but they make hundreds of millions dollars a month. Like how many people do they have on board? How many subscribers? So they have that are paying $9 as far as I know, they don't share that information. They're killing it in terms of subscribers, but they're 10 billion in debt. They just talk on another 2 billion. Right. When I say Netflix has done, I'm speaking when anytime I make declarations, I'm speaking in the future. Right. I'm like, we prepare now for the future. Well, how will they hear it goes? Netflix will keep friends through next year and $100 million payment, $100 million, right? For one year of friends. And then the office too.

Speaker 1:          02:27          That is though, that's like nostalgia style jet, right. So all viewing right now is nostalgia even? Well, not all viewing, no. If you look at TV, right? What did great this, this, this past years in TV, right? The OJ trial and FX. What does that, I remember I was, when the Oj thing came out, did that do that, killed it, won all the awards, everything. Uh, the Versace story, which is another thing like what? That out of the loop. I'm just 39 million, 339 million subscribers paying $10 a month. Is that what it is? How much does the cross like that? Maybe even more. Maybe 11 how much does it cost? Uh, at, they just bumped it up to 12 I think. 12 bucks a month. Sure. That ladies and gentlemen is a fuck load of income. Sure. So they got a lot coming in, but they're spending a lot too because they're trying to, they're trying to overtake all the others and then they got Jeff Bezos, you know, captain moneybags up there, a scrooge McDuck.

Speaker 1:          03:16          Right. He's trying to do the same thing. Facebook should, which, where I saw you right on sneaky Pete. Yeah. I was like, yeah, true. But that's the basis can lose money on this shit because he's making tons of money on paper towels. I wonder how much he is losing because he's got a lot of fucking series at, ain't nobody watching them that put it out there, but he's doing something that's even more weird because there's no one watching those shows. Yeah. There's a ton of fucking shows on Amazon that fucking no one's watching. Yeah, I would like to see their numbers because I bet they have some shows. They might, they might have spent $1 million to make and have like four viewers. It's fucking, no one watched these shows. They were just going after awards. They're thing was, we're going to make the artsy shit, oh it's going to give us a grammy or something like that and then we'll like qualify our platform.

Speaker 1:          04:03          It's a smart approach. Like youtube approach was the exact opposite, right. We're like, we're just going to create this stuff that we think people want to watch. Well, Youtube doesn't create much. They did a little and they took down the paywall. Like my thing I, my guests with youtube is there waiting for Netflix. You know that scene in the movie where like that's somebody's caught in like an enclosed space and water starts coming in and the water gets right up to like his lips. You know, he's like, he's trying to breathe a little bit more and I think youtube just is going to be the one to pour the last drop of water. I think it's such a different thing. I think you're talking about two totally different things because Netflix has never aimed to be a user created content streaming site. Right? Right. They're not, but at the end of the day it's just distraction I think.

Speaker 1:          04:44          I think that's what we've got to start looking at content as, right. It's, it's, it's just raw distraction and Netflix occupies a space for distraction did smaller than youtube, so I can watch a two hour thing on youtube at home, on my TV. I can watch a two minute thing on the bus as I'm going to work on youtube, you know, I can watch a 15 minute, you know, peace like Vlog or something like that. I can watch all the whole spectrum. Netflix, I'm really just watching at home or like a foam on a trip, you know what I mean? It's really, I'm not watching a two minute thing on Netflix, you know what I mean? It's, it is the shit for now. Don't get me wrong. It absolutely the shit for now. Right, but if I was being, if I'm putting my money on it, I would say if I'm Facebook I buy it and then imagine having your Facebook feed.

Speaker 1:          05:34          You just watched a show and then you get to share it immediately on your Facebook. If I was Facebook I'd be super careful about buying anything because I think the government's been thinking about breaking them up for a while and Elizabeth Warren is already talking about that. That's one of the parts of their, her platform and running for president is breaking up apple, breaking up Facebook, breaking up. Twitter just wants to break up all these things. She are monopolies. What's your feeling on that? Get the fuck Outta here with that first. She is goofy. He's Goofy as fuck. What's up? Disney takeover of 21st century Fox takes place I think next week. The 20th to Bega. They are going to put out their own stream. Everything. They've just, they bought like everything except for Fox News and Fox sports took over all of their production movie facilities, like 5,000 people might be losing their job because it's coming off a Netflix.

Speaker 1:          06:24          Marvel shows all that shit is going to come over to them. So now they're going to have a nice [inaudible]. That's why they've been canceling all these marvel shows on the flower. I keep investing in something, right. You're going to take off, like I'm going to build up a brand and then remove it, right. You own it. They've got so they got all the kids movies. You're a bear at that, you know what I mean? Dude, I go to Disneyland twice a year at least. Which you're gonna not have the streaming Disney program, will they all apples also starting their streaming service soon tomorrow or some show and knows when, but there's tons of rumors are coming out today. You know what it's like, you know the perestroika, like what happened in Russia, like where the overnight, you know, it fell and they sold off the state assets, like a few people and everybody came. Billionaires. Right. That's what's happening right now in entertainment. Dude, don't realize it, but like, it's fucking done. Like the days of the days of like fame being about distance are done. Distance, distance. Like I'm Johnny Depp. I'm going to go to way to my little home somewhere in the Alps and you will see me twice a year. You're not, I'm weird on Marlon Brando. I'm, I'm out here. I'm weird. I'm different. You know, it's like now it's proximity as reasonable. No value in being weird anymore. Well, Marlon Brando, Tyler Perry has an island.
