Speaker 1:          00:00          As part of that. There's definitely something to that. And I think there's something to this problem that human beings have, um, where they, they have an idea and that idea becomes part of their identity and then they start arguing for that idea. And any argument against that idea is an argument against them as a person cause they're trying to win. They're not necessarily looking at things in an objective way where they're detached from the idea and studying it as a thing. Instead they're arguing to try to win. And I think that is a giant problem with ideas. Yes. And it becomes even more of a problem when it gets tribal, when these ideas are attached, like climate change clearly attached in denial to the right in support to the left. It's this very strange tribal thing. And that also happens with gender. And it also like if you are in support of of women's rights and you are a in support of trans rights and Lbgtq and all that jazz, you're almost a hundred percent going to be on the left.

Speaker 1:          01:06          It's just one of those tribal things. If you're pro choice, you're almost always going to be on the left. If you're not, you find yourself in that. Which one was it? Was it Tammy Lauren? I get her confused with that. Lauren southern girls. Those girls are interchangeable in some strange way. Those the, the, the hot Republicans and Tomi Lahren, Tomi Lahren, she's pro choice. She got attacked. Can't be, can't be. You want to be on this team. You want to be on the, the mean white girl team. You can't be project you gotta you gotta be prolife. What about life but about the babies support the bait. We, you know what I'm saying? I was like, some ideas get locked into ideologies. They get locked into these tribal ideologies and gender is most certainly one of those people don't want to be without a political home. Right. That's a very good way of putting it because if you do say, say someone like Tommy Tommy, who is what our core Tammy, cause I'm an asshole. Oh, was she in trouble? Tomi Lahren was star in prolife film after the break. The blaze fired her for being pro choice. What? So if you're a pro choice conservative or if you're a pro biology liberal, you know, you kind of find yourself in a weird in between. So she's just fucking going the other way. She's going the other way. She's going to start a film. What's a pro life film? It's like ABC after school special. Don't have an abortion. Have you baby?

Speaker 1:          02:32          Yeah. Hmm. It's weird. Well she's got to get her ground back. Kicked off the team a little bit. It's a bio pic on the Roe vs Wade case starting Stacey Dash. Oh so, so maybe she's playing a bad person and that movie, it just made it even more interesting. Strange. I wonder how many of those things are just distractions. You know, it's so weird. People are so weird with their, their, their tribal identities, you know, I just, and I love when they go back and forth and shift from one side of the other. I'd love it when like wow, former conservative scene, the light or you know, I used to be a liberal to the party, lost me and I love that. And then they go hardcore on the other side is weird cause it's then everything shifts is not just a couple of views. It's everything in alignment with the other side. How did you join the church? Yup. Stop doing drugs. Yeah. It's fascinating. It's fascinating.
