Speaker 1:          00:03          He was like way deep in the TAC. Oh yeah. Nice uppercut by canal. He was definitely like a big check tax trouble before we got bailed out with a fight in the past. Do you think they reimagine? I think the rematch they should. Why not? I think Connor would have to beat somebody good in a boxing match and he would also have to have a real training camp, I think. I think boxing's over for Connor. Oh, I don't think so. That is one more fight like that cause people will buy it kind of went to the 10th round. He got fatigued it there's still a motive for people to buy it. Yeah. I mean look, he, he went the very first fight against the greatest hour and so many of you didn't like to bag. You're right. Yeah, you're right. You're right. There's that too. But the thing is if there's a legit big fight, like say if Canelo Alvarez steps up and says that he wants to fight Conor Mcgregor, Conor, I'll do it. He might be a smart, I think Connor made me realize you've got to specialize, but actually you can't do both. Especially the difference between Canelo and Floyd. Floyd was just a brilliant boxer. Canelo is a murderous puncher and he'll fuck you up. He'll hurt. There's also a promotional difference to Kyron. Flood are pretty much, they're very similar guys, and they both understood what they were doing promotion wise. I don't know if Canelo is that guy. Well, he's not gonna promote it that way, but he's got, oh, look that up or cut. That's his genius.

Speaker 1:          01:33          It's, he's got the support of the American people love again versus Mcgregor.

Speaker 2:          01:39          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:39          Ooh, look at that upper cut. I don't know if Mcgregor would take that fight. No, that sounded good. Fight for him either neither Canelo or Lufkin's a good fight for him. It's a terrible fight for him. Those guys are different. They're, they're, they're, they're this, you know, like, look at the way these guys fight.
