Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience or who knows, they might be pro Trump. Trump just sold off the loss of national parks grand staircase, open it up for oil and gas drilling. They probably liked that shit, man. Yeah. That's an interesting thing. Like I've heard very different versions of that from z Zinky when that guys, what does he, secretary of the interior. What does Zinky yeah, when he was talking about it, he's explained to us not what happened and that essentially went right back to where the way it was before Obama changed the, the legislation changed the rules. I don't understand. It was protected under Obama for a good reason. There's dinosaur fossils, they're native Americans have monuments there, but of course we don't care about native American monuments. We just care about confederate monuments. We don't care about abolishing all the native American land and all the treaties. We just care about protecting bizarre confederate statues around the country.

Speaker 1:          00:50          I don't think we should protect confederate statues and in the sense that I don't think they should be in like the middle of fucking times help squares and shit like that. But they should do something with them the same way they should do something with Gingiss con statues, Thrombus Museum. Do you know that most of those things were made during the um, the Jim Crow era? That's a relational Swain constructed. That's an amazing point. A lot of people think that it was right after the civil war and in fact it was like in the 60s it was during the civil rights movement. There was a protest to the civil rights move. A little Donald doing here. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:28          Well here, here's a statue and they're shitty statues to a lot of them. Like really poorly constructed there. Made him quickly. Yeah, it was a protest to the civil rights movement. A lot of them. That's crazy. But the thing is like they are a representation of history. Just like a Gig is con statute would be a representation of that monster. I mean, we think of Gingiss ECON is a guy who opened up trade with China today. You know, you vaguely understand that he was responsible for the death of 10% of the population of the world back then. Change The fucking New York Times had an article about how he changed the carbon footprint of the earth. They, there's literally a difference in the carbon footprint because 10% less people were alive during Gingiss Khan's reign because they killed everybody. They fucking quit killing millions of people. There's a great Dan Carlin series on it called the wrath of the cons, but I've talked about it way too much.

Speaker 1:          02:19          But today, youngest comes not offensive like you could bring up getting those comp. Nobody cares. Me waiting more horrific than anything that happened during the civil war. They had slaves and they, they did everything they used. They would capture people and use them as the front line and they'd push them towards their own people. So they would get shot. They will be the first people to get shot with arrows. And I mean there's some horrific shit, but I think, I think we should melt kingus Khan statues. I think the confederacy is just so much more recent and yeah. Was mines do something with it though? I mean I don't think it should be in town square for sure. In anybody's Townsquared. Yeah, but I think they should do something with them instead of melting them are smashing them. They should put them somewhere at least for the future lease for future people to like look back.

Speaker 1:          03:01          Like look, this is how fucking wacky people were in the 1960s they construct these Omadjela has to the 18 hundreds and slavery was legal. They constructed these statues to sort of paint these people in this heroic fashion that we're fighting to keep black people slaves. That's part of the thing. There was, this is all right there as part of the history of this country. We've got to put it somewhere. I mean, I'm not saying it should be worshiped. Definitely shouldn't be prominently featured. So yeah, there should be something like that. Right, right. Yeah. And, but it should be like detailed description of when it was constructed and why was he instructs exactly who made it, what was the political affiliation of the people that created it? Totally. Yeah, totally. It stopped this whitewash and bullshit like that. Every time MLK day comes around, I'm always just like, did you know MLK was like a rabid anti militarist and anti imperialist? No, because they, he was the most hated black man in America. Someone said, do you know that he used to fuck all these white women, like who does only fucking white women? It gives us a lot of fun. He did this person. We had a good time.

Speaker 1:          04:09          That's going to be the bad thing. Oh, well you just turned it around for me. I'm okay that I have a dream speech. It's so strange. But people how they turn on things.

Speaker 2:          04:31          Yeah.
