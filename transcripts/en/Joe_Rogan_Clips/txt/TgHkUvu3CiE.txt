Speaker 1:          00:00          Spoken alliance. It's not a secret, it's just, it's not there. It's there, but it's not, nobody's talking about it. Do you realize, I'll just give an example. Okay. If you needed more reasons to think that Columbus was a dick. Okay. Let me add one to it. When we were kids and today, I know, I know, but actually I do have something smiley redeeming to offer about Columbus if you have the time. I just want to, okay, let's start off with that. Do you want me start out with that? How do you want to do it? I'll do the dick part. Okay, so on his third voyage, he's in, by the time of his third voyage, he had already planted enough Spanish flags that Spain had already begun to set up governments and infrastructures in these places that he had a compound basically conquered and so, so in one of the places was it, it's in the book accurately, but I think it's Hispaniola.

Speaker 1:          00:59          One of the island today he has to get back is it's third voice, 1503 1504 he's got to get back to Spain. He doesn't have enough resources, not enough food for his crew. So he asks the natives, would you please give us some of your stock that you have collected from your farming? Now this particular group of natives only makes exactly the amount of food they need to tie to the next crop. They don't have surplus. So they said, no, we don't have surplus. Sorry. Columbus knew that one week, hence, coincidentally there was gonna be a total lunar eclipse with a moon in its orbit around Earth, enters earth's shadow. The full moon enters earth's shadow and disappears. And that the geometry of that event, it's just a simple lunar eclipse, but the geometry says that sunlight passes around earth through earth's atmosphere and takes on sunset colors that Leech into Earth's shadow giving the moon.

Speaker 1:          02:01          If you can see it at all, a deep red amber hue, almost the color of blood Columbus set. And he knew about this cause he had read the tables, the eclipse tables. All right? We, we'd known enough about the solar system at the time too. We got that. Okay. Actually back then, it was just the known world with Earth in the middle of the known universe. But that didn't matter. The rhythms of the universe, we're known. He says to the natives, if you do not give us food, my God, which is more powerful than your God will make the moon disappear and it will turn blood red. That will happen in one week. You have one week to comply. Some of them were skeptical of what you can't. What other sets? Shit, we got to do what this guy said. Look at the ships. They came in, their guns, their power, their, their culture.

Speaker 1:          02:54          Look what they've got. Sure enough, right on cue. The moon begins to disappear according to that. That is a famous woodcut. Um Oh, you got this. Oh those viewing the video of this. That is a famous woodcut. And notice the natives bowing to him and he stands proudly cause he knows the science. He knows the astronomy. He knew this. And so he invokes this to dominate people who are not yet scientifically literate. And within seconds of this beginning, they bring him all the resources he wants. And he gets, and I don't, we don't know what happened, you know, back at the island whether the people survived the winter, but he got back to the island, that that is one microcosm of a set of ways that the universe has been invoked in this. I'll give you another example of Los Alamos, one of the national labs.

Speaker 1:          03:46          They today as basically since their inception, are charged with tracking the nuclear arsenal of the United States, our nuclear power, the, the nukes that would go into nuclear weapons. They think about this. Do you realize they hire astrophysicist? I had colleagues work in there. You know why? Because there's our room. There are two rooms. I mean I'm, I'm, I'm simplifying this, but basically there are two rooms adjacent to one another and a computer between the two of them, the most powerful computers in the world, and there is code running on those computers that calculates the energy yields of hydrogen fusion. That's exactly what an astrophysicist cares about when stars blow up. Okay. The Sun is undergoing nuclear fusion right now and that's how it's making energy and when the, when high mass stars dies, they exploded supernova. This is a natural thing going on. Then you ever in the universe on the other side, that's a classified room.

Speaker 1:          04:47          They're calculating yields of hydrogen bombs and they have lunch together and they compare notes. The government doesn't always have the best people, but if you hire some of the best people to do whatever it is they want and they'd calculations happen to relate to a military project there you have a two way street in progress. Why do you think the Hubble telescope that the, the, the mirror issues not withstanding, which were ultimately fixed when it was first launched, why was that so successful? There were versions of the Hubble telescope previously launched by the military looking down that, that the model for that telescope had already been conceived and built and was operating. Then we say, oh, we want one of those. Okay, but we don't, that's not public that this is going on. We designed, the telescope gets designed. It has the benefit of previous versions of it.

Speaker 1:          05:43          Having been used successfully, but looking down and we look up, this is the perennial two way street of astronomy in the old days and in modern times, astrophysics and the invention of the, you haven't said anything yet or you just, you look, you're a good listener. I'll should I keep, just keep talking and by preventing you from interrupting. Don't worry about me. Okay, fine. Galileo perfects the telescope. He learned that it had just been invented in the Netherlands. The Dutch were were up opticians. All right, so they invented the telescope and the microscope within a couple of years of one another. This transformed science. When did they invent the eyeglass? The reading class, the reading earlier than that, but I don't, I don't know when the real advance was putting two lenses in line with one another. Sounds trivial in modern times, but that was a huge leap. Conceptual leap and what you would accomplish and in so doing, depending on how you curve them and how you grind them, grind that, the shape of those lenses you would get a microscope or telescope and, and we're off to the races.

Speaker 1:          06:48          That's basically the birth of modern science as we now think of it. And, and, and, and conducted. Because you say to yourself, my senses, I don't trust them to be the full record of what's going on in front of me. You pull out a microscope. Oh my gosh. Leeuwenhoek he got the microscope guy. He thought he got a drop of pond water, puts it under his microscope just to think to do this. It's just water. Why do you think that's something interesting to do? He said, I wonder, he was curious. He puts it under and sees little what he described as Anna macules happily, uh, swimming. And I'm acute macules these are like the Amoebas and paramecium and Oh, it is. And so he writes a heat reports on this too, to the scientific authorities. And they don't believe him. They say, uh, you know, [inaudible] uh, we think you might have had too much gin before you wrote this letter.

Speaker 1:          07:50          Why would anyone believe this? That there's entire creatures, an entire universe of creatures thriving in a drop of pond water. And so the way science works is one report does not make it true. You need verification. They send people to the Netherlands to verify his results and there it was the birth of microscopy and then they looked at everything sells, you know, they need vocabulary to describe what you're now seeing. Well that was the, the, the, the journey down small. Then the journey went up big and Galileo perfects the telescope. He looks up, he's like, Whoa, I see craters, mountains, valleys on the moon. The Sun has spots. Venus goes through phases. This became the Corpus of evidence for earth going around the sun in Supportive Copernicus's idea that earth went around the sun. My point is, what was the second thing he did with his telescope? He telephone. No, they didn't tell me. He contacted the Doge of Venice, invited him to the clock tower and said, look at what this instrument can do for you. As we look out into the lagoon, you can identify a ship's intentions, friend or foe by its flag 10 times farther away than you can with the unaided eye.

Speaker 1:          09:09          Venice bought a boatload of these telescopes in the service of their military defense, and this was a source of money to Galileo, and now he could go look at the universe. This has been a two way street ever since. People have looked up. So, so this is, this is an accounting of that. This is, it's and, and it's it, it goes on and on the first x ray machines for airports, you're old enough to remember. Why would they put in because of hijackings to Cuba, basically that they were armed hijackings of airplanes of American carriers to Cuba. And Congress said, we gotta do something about that. Oh, by the way, there's a company in Boston called American Science and engineering that was building an x ray detector, small enough to put on a satellite to observe the universe in x rays. And because no one had zipped, we've used visible light, but not x rays.

Speaker 1:          10:02          That's a branch of the electromagnetic spectrum. We think if they're black holes out there, their region surrounding them will give us x rays. It's a new window on the universe. And then they said, oh my gosh, there's a call for x ray machines at airports. We've got the technology that we've perfected to put it up frickin satellite. So the technology for those ones, you walked through the airport initially came initially? Yes, yes, yes. There was a two way street. There was, oh my gosh, we need this for security. Oh, by God we would, we were using, let's, let's, let's apply that technology to these detectors. Well, that's been a lot of the stuff with the space program. Right. And a lot of the stuff that they devised for use on the space station and so many other technologies have trickled their way down.
