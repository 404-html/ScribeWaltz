Speaker 1:          00:00          You live in New York, where you live in, in New York, when Tribeca flooded a few years ago, what was that like? Well, I mean I think in a situation like that, um, most people emerge from a particular disaster and think, my God, since this is so awful, it must be an anomaly. And you know, I think New York was really horrified as a city by Sandy, but there's going to be, sandy is, I don't remember the exact stat like once every five years by the end of this category storm Sandy, I think it made landfall as a category three. So it's not even a five. Yeah. So if a five hidden, is it possible for five to hit New York as a too far north? No, as possible. Totally possible. I was talking to a really prominent climate scientist a few months ago who is like one of the, he was one of the lead authors on the UN report, um, lives in New York, does a lot of consulting with the city.

Speaker 1:          00:56          And I said, so we're going to build a sea wall to protect New York from flooding. And he was like, oh, absolutely. You know, Manhattan real estate, it's way too expensive to let flood. So we'll definitely build a seawall. But an infrastructure project like that takes at least 30 years to build. And if we started right now, we wouldn't be able to finish in time to save Howard beach and parts of Brooklyn and Queens. If we started right now, he said, he said, the city knows this and you'll see in the next few years, they'll stop doing repairs on infrastructure. They'll stop attending to the subway lines in those neighborhoods. And even a few years after that, they'll start staying explicitly to the people who live there. You might be able to continue living in these homes for a couple of decades, but you're not going to be able to live them, leave them to your kids.

Speaker 1:          01:43          Whoa. This is in New York City. It's like the richest country in the richest city in the world. And he a huge parts of, um, huge parts of southern Brooklyn and Queens are going to be underwater. So for the people that live there right now, what parts are you talking about? Um, well the one that, the one that he mentioned most explicitly was Howard beach, but, um, which is, it's kind of an inch. It's like a mob neighborhood and you know, it's still, yeah. Really well. Yeah. Yeah. So cause that was like the Gotti neighborhood, right? Yeah. That's where they buried all the dead bodies. Wow. Um, I didn't know that was still a mob neighborhood. Well, you know, to the extent that there is a mob. Yeah. Um, and yeah, I mean that's true everywhere on the coast, everywhere. It's not just New York. New York's not exceptional.

Speaker 1:          02:29          You know, their projections that like $30 billion of New Jersey real estate could be underwater by 20, 30, 20, 30. Why does that not as alarming was born in New Jersey. It's not as alarming. And then, you know, Miami beaches, you know, Miami beach has done for, yeah. Miami beach is almost inevitable. Correct? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, they could, they could build a seawall, but that, those, that's not going to help because of the, the ground. Right. It's just so expensive. So you really have to, um, you really have to pick your poison and then when you look around the world, you know, it's like Bangladesh, that country is going to be almost entirely underwater. That's hundreds of millions of people. If we wanted to build a seawall, they can't afford that. Who's going to afford, who's going to pay for that? And this is all because of the raising sea level because of the melting ice, because of the temperature and all of this is happening and I think, you know, we think of sea level is really a thing that happens on the coastline, which it is primarily, but it also increases flooding on rivers because the water is all connected of course.

Speaker 1:          03:33          So flooding in the UK is expected to grow 50 folds by the end of the century. What will that life d fold? London is already like underwater a couple times a year. I mean not the whole city, but it is this Jamie, this is Bangladesh. I just went to oh dash underwater video that pops up. Oh my God, these people are fucked. Yeah. It says 18 million residents live here. That's a swamp. Yeah. That looks crazy. Like it. Like if you are a real estate projector and you're flying over that like uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We can't belt here. Yeah. Jakarta will be totally underwhelmed person as apartment buildings. Like you could see the water level. Look back up a little bit. This is just a running little thing. But if you see, look at like, doesn't that look like a water level on the, the apartment buildings in the right hand side near where your cursor is like, like that's gonna go up to where that orange level is fucking Christ.

Speaker 1:          04:22          Well, I mean over millennia where they're going to rise hundreds of feet. Oh God. I mean it's going to take a long time so you can adjust to that a little bit. But um, but that's always been the case, right? The, they're still fine. They find these artifacts and things in the middle of the ocean areas where people used to be able to live and now they can't live anymore. Yeah, I think that'll be, we have to move, people have to move. So what's a good spot? Alberta, anywhere, anywhere, anywhere. Off The tin. That's the spot now. I mean I think I would like that all the time. And I say, you know, honestly the place that I would move to is somewhere in Scandinavia really because, um, you know, I talked about the impact of economic growth before, but they're going to be parts of the world, the benefit economically from this anywhere in the north.

Speaker 1:          05:10          So Canada, Russia and Scandinavia will benefit because, but why don't go to Scandinavia, go to Canada. It's right there. Well let's get a, seems kind of keep pretty hard to me. I did that. Scandinavia is nice, but Canada is like our neighbors, they also, they have wildfires there to Canada and in the Arctic Circle in Finland, bears and outlines. But so you know, these, these guys, the economists who study this stuff say that, um, there is actually an optimal temperature for human productivity. It's 13 degrees Celsius, which is the historical media and temperature of the u s it's also the historical median temperature of Germany. What does 13 Celsius? Was that 60 degrees or something like that? And I think it's like in the high fifties.

Speaker 2:          05:52          Well, we've got Jamie,

Speaker 1:          05:55          Google doesn't give it to you, right whenever I'm in Canada, I'm always like, I don't know what you're saying. Yeah. They're like, Holy Shit, it's 22 degrees, 55. Um, and so for every degree north of that you lose about a percentage point of GDP. So the u s is now at about 13 and a half a degree Celsius at our media and temperature. That means that we're losing about a half percentage point of GDP every year from it. But there are parts of the u s that were cooler than 13 and are now brought up to this optimal level. Silicon valley is like exactly at 13 degrees right now. Um, which is, you know, notable cause they're like super productive and that's going to be, so that'll be true for Scandinavian generally. And it may be part of the explanation why there's been so much economic productivity in Scandinavia over the last generation is that they have already started doing better with temperature.

Speaker 1:          06:46          Crops are going to be more bountiful in Russia. Like Russia will have better agriculture because of global warming, which is why they make such a, you know, there, there is such a complicated figure in the geopolitical story about climate. So they are a petro state. They have almost all of their economic activity activity has to do with burning oil, but there are also poised to benefit from warming. So they're doubly motivated to produce more global warming and they have such a fuck the rest of the world perspective that they're not going to stop. Whereas Canada probably they're like likely to, even though they'd benefit from more warming, they'll probably get on board with any program to avert warming. But that is a, um, that's a dilemma that faces every nation. You know, like Justin Trudeau gets, you know, talks a lot of shit about Donald Trump and his climate policy, but he, Justin Trudeau is also approving new pipelines on Glen.

Speaker 1:          07:35          Marco does the same, but she is retiring, um, nuclear so quickly in Germany that they're having to use dirty energy. Um, and even though they've had this incredible green energy revolution there, their emissions are going up. Um, and every country in the world is, it's a collective action problem. Every country in the world is incentivized to behave badly and let the rest of the world clean up the mess. So I was talking to this guy yesterday about wildfires and he was like, you know, California is doing so great, you know, with all of the emission standards, they're basically, you know, holding themselves to the Paris accords even though the country as a whole isn't, but that impact isn't local. It's global. So it's dissipated. The temperature impact on California wildfires will be determined by it. Like I said earlier, basically what China does. So in terms of, you know, what any individual area with any, any individual nation is doing, the motivations are really, really complicated there.

Speaker 1:          08:30          And in California in particular, this is a bit of a tangent, but um, you know, the state has done incredible stuff with emission standards, fuel efficiency, green energy, and yet all of those gains now are wiped out every year by the fires because fires are trees, trees or burning trees are basically coal in the sense that they are stored carbon when they burn, they release carbon into the atmosphere. So every time there are wildfires like they were last year in California, it literally wipes out all of the progress that the state made in all of its green initiatives that year. Um, yeah, and you know about in, in, in, in Brazil, the, um, the president of Brazil wants to like basically de forest, the Amazon, the Amazon is responsible for something like 30% of the world's oxygen, um, and is a huge, so all plants obviously absorb carbon and produce oxygen. Um, to plant life is really good for fighting climate change. When you say he wants a divorce, the Amazon, at what scale? What does he, what does he talk about doing? So the scientists who have studied his proposal say that his plans would be the equivalent of adding over a 10 year period, adding a second China to the world's global footprint.
