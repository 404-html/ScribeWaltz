Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience, you know, I remember he cried after the Vegas Shooting and he's from Vegas. Did he cry recently? Was it the school shooting? Yeah. Yeah, but that was brutal though. He's fucking go out with, was there that night and she was at the trop and then all the people came running down into the trop. Oh, so new year's Eve, I'm with Vegas shooting people. They had to stay there for a couple hours. They had everything under locked down because they didn't know who had guns and who did. And they didn't know it was one person or 50 people. Right. And she's there. She's at the trop. And uh, she got kind of traumatized by it. So New Year's Eve, we're walking outside and all of a sudden she starts shaking and she was having an anxiety attack, you know, about being in a crowd. So I was just fucking are trying to make her laugh.

Speaker 1:          00:45          I said, no, don't, don't worry about it. And then we're, you know, fireworks. So she said, all I really care about is fireworks. And you took that away from me because you're selfish and feelings, you know, but, but I got her laughing anyway. The fucking, the, the volume of them, it's just, it seems like every couple months there's a new one. You remember when Columbine, we thought this is terrible and it's won't happen again. It's like there's so many Nalia, you know, you get used to it, which has said, yeah, it's fucking crazy. And I don't know what the answer is. You know, I don't know if it's a tighter gun control. I don't know if that would stop them because it would just make it more difficult to get guns. But would that be enough? I mean, but we're not doing anything. Well, interesting thing. Got to try something.

Speaker 1:          01:29          I don't know what to do. I mean, and there's also the number of people that are on psychiatric medications. It's fucking crazy. Well, I think that for the [inaudible] or whatever they are, they shouldn't be sold. They shouldn't be. I mean, I, we didn't really need that to, to kill a pheasant. It's not a, a hunting gun really. You're the guy who designed them, said he it was w we made it for war. Yeah. The real real guns for hunting are usually usually bolt action rifles, which means you have a, around, you have usually two or three in the magazine. You have a couple or one in the chamber. You put it in there, cheeky, lock it in place, the clamp it down and you fire a shot and then you have to bolt it again. You have to use the, the action again. The shell pops out and another one goes in, bolt that down and then you get another shot.

Speaker 1:          02:19          It's a very slow thing. It takes a couple of second musket. Whereas these ais, you're like tack, tack, tack, tack tack or with the bump stocks. They apparently the president wants a ban bump stocks with a bump. Stock is, Oh yeah. It's a stock where you pull back on it and apparently you push forward and pull back at the same time. Uh, I might be fucking this up, but the thing is the stock makes the, the trigger go like that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that where it's almost like an automatic weapon. And Trump just decided to ban those. And there's a lot of people that are up in arms about him banning those, like these, the gun rights. People don't want to lose anything. They don't want to lose any rights. Right? They don't want to lose any fucking crazy ass weapons.

Speaker 1:          03:04          They think that any slip is, uh, is eventually going to lead to them getting their guns taken away. Like I follow a bunch of NRA people and gone people on Twitter and Instagram take their guns away. They think they are, they think they are. I mean, I agree with you. I don't think that's ever going to come to that, but the idea that tighter regulation, um, is bad. I don't think that's true. I think, uh, I think first of all, you should have to go through some sort of examination. If you can go through an exam, you don't, you can't drive a fucking car unless you prove that you know how to operate a car. Like someone has to be there with you. That's an expert. So driving expert, who watches you? They watch. Make sure you know what to do. What do you do here at this light?

Speaker 1:          03:46          Do you know how to hit the brakes? Do you stop perfectly look left and right before you turn all that shit is super important. If you want to drive, how the fuck is it? Not Super important if you operate a goddamn firearm. I know, I don't understand. I like the kid who bought the, I think the kid who did the, uh, the latest shooting in Florida, I think it was, if I'm a have, I'm putting two stories together, I don't know. But apparently he was under age and had fake id and still was able to buy it. I don't know. I didn't read that story. That'd be, you know, I avoided the story. I saw the kid's face and I saw the, it's, it's fucking insane. And then you hear all the stories about kids that were saying that they knew that this kid was going to be a school shooter anyway.

Speaker 1:          04:25          They, they, they were saying in, in the past. And then one of the things he wrote, he wrote it on Facebook or something that he wants to be a professional school shooter. And then two years later and he got visited by the FBI, the FBI actually checked this fucking kid out. Talk to him about him, the side, he wasn't a threat. How do you decide someone's a threat or not a threat? Well, if you're talking to them, they're a threat. I mean, they may be, I can't talk to everybody, but I, I would, I would be suspicious of anyone that it took that much energy to go find out. What, how did they find them? Why would they, why would they would question him? Yeah. Um, I think people were saying that he's a fucking psychopath. Yeah. It hurts. It's just sad. It's just fucking sad that it's sad that anyone could do that.

Speaker 1:          05:10          It's sad that anyone would be hurting and so fucked up that you could take a child. Imagine you have a kid, right? You got a little dom Irrera little tiny baby, and he's just a cute little fella, little tiny baby, and they don't know anything. They didn't tickle him. And then from there one day that becomes as to a school shooter, Oh my God. That's what people have to take into consideration. This boy, this 19 year old boy who did that was a baby at one point in time. He's a failed process of failed product. Yeah.
