Speaker 1:          00:00          Fuck man. Is that this? So that's the scariest thing in Africa in terms of like interacting with human beings. You know what the scariest thing in Africa is? Mosquitoes. Oh yeah, of course. Right? Like all, all, all stuff. You can see all the big wildlife, you can kind of feel it out and you put yourself in the bad situations. Mosquitoes, there's nothing. You know what I mean? You just know you can do about it. Yeah. My Buddy Justin wren, he a runs fight for the forgotten charity. They build wells for the pygmies. Okay. And He's been bitten. He's gotten malaria three times. Yeah. And one time he got it like he didn't even get bit again. The malaria just returned. If so, it must be in some way systemic, I think. I believe it is. I don't, I don't never had it. Knock on wood, my grandfather had it, but I know that it's it.

Speaker 1:          00:46          It wrecks you for life. Like it can come back. You can get it again. It stays with you. I think that's his situation. And he's a professional athlete. He's actually a fighter for Bella. He's one of their, a heavyweight contenders. Damn. Yeah. Has he said that it's affected his performance? No, I don't think it has. I think a, I think he's been okay with it. You know, he received treatment, but it's definitely rectum on three separate occasions where he was, you know, basically on death's door. Right. And one of them was, and he's flying back. Damn. You know, and he's just sweating and it just rotting out and the inside was awful. Say you want to ask what scares me? That's it. Like I would, I'll take a hippo, a snake, a crock of Leopard. Anything over that? Yeah. Malaria is terrifying. You see, malaria has killed more people than anything ever.

Speaker 1:          01:31          Really. You know, malaria has killed half the people that have ever died. Oh my God, that's insane. Just make sure that's right. There might be bullshit too. That sounds good. I think it's real. I think, I think we actually have googled this before. The malaria is literally killed 50% of all the people that have ever done. That's insane. Yeah. It's not to me that people were worried about so many different things. And you should be worried about Miskito. Exactly. Well, apparently they're, they're trying to genetically engineer mosquitoes to, uh, to, to be void of devoid of malaria and they hybridize. Right. So my understanding is the way that it's done is they genetically engineer at the males to reproduce with the females, which are the malaria carriers and then the offspring of that generation can no longer carry malaria. Yeah. Okay. Malaria killed half the people who've ever lived.

Speaker 1:          02:21          That is bonkers. It's a myth. Yeah. It would have had to kill. It says like five and a half million people on average per year every year for all of human history. And that's not, I think it kills half a million a year. I think the real numbers like half the size, it would have to be five and a half ago. So it was just one of those things that people say, yeah, I like it. I should probably shut the fuck up. But what else is new? Um, so how many people have they killed? A lot. Okay, we'll go with a lot.

Speaker 1:          02:49          So other other does. I mean like typhoid and shit. Isn't there like a fucking case of typhoid in California now, right? Yes. Yeah. Well we've got some weird situations in this country with measles returning and polio returning. All these came in. Yeah. What the Hell Nah. Outbreaks expands and La and Long Beach. Jesus. Cool me down here, Joe. Congratulations. There's no, it was my hand was sweaty when they're different, but it's different. It's similar but different. It's not typhoid. It's typhus. Oh. Fleet borne disease that can be treated with antibiotics or something. Yeah. I'm terrified of Lyme disease to have you had line? No, but I have a gang of friends that have had it and it wrecks them. Well, you spend a ton of time hiking around and stuff out here. Yeah. Well California doesn't have much Lyme, but east coast it's horrific. It's like everybody that spends time outdoors in the northeast seems to get it. Yeah. And I don't know what you can do about that. There was a vaccine that they were doing for awhile, but um, one of my friends, her dad actually got Lyme disease from the vaccine. Huh? Like he didn't have it got vaccinated and Mondo catching it from the vaccine and I think they were like, okay, fuck this proxy. Sorry. Cause they had it for a while. I've done, that's no fun. Yeah.
