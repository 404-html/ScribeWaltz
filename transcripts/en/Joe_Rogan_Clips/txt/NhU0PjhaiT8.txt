Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. That's what they're going to do. Yup. Maybe they'll do that international fight week to don. Don Sizzler, trying to get these ratings up for Fox buys. Ww. Imagine if Brock's first fight back as John Jones. Yeah, I can. Yeah, I can just the car. Don't look in that mother fucker. It's not July. Yes. Yes. Steep a DC Granshawn Jones. Brock. Preach. Tyron Woodley. Dosign Joe's or Tayga? Max Holloway. Amanda Nunez. Cyborg. We busted this load on this one card. Whew. Whew. Whew, whew. We can still do the ratings did that, that place would be the same. It'd be insane. That'd be one of the greatest cards of all talkers. And then I taught you sprinkle in this swink a little cm punk. Mm. You wouldn't be able to do that one. Why? Because that one needs so much money. The one that I'm thinking about, which one? You know the one, which one?

Speaker 1:          01:02          Joe? The one that was a lot of sprinkles on top. Which will you know that boxer guy? What's his name? Oh, you talking about employee Tim? Something money that we keep talking about. If that happened, and this is by the way, I believe you and I were the first speculate. That's publicly correct. I think that's the fight. I think that's the fight to make. I agree. I don't know if it'll ever happen, but I think it does. It does happen. It happens on its own individual card. You put a kick ass card underneath it, but I don't know if you put like a UFC 200 size kick ass card or anything. No. Cause Floyd and cm punk skin cell is a cell. And also if you're Floyd, just leave it from Floyd's perspective. All right, pay me this much money, which I boatload of cash and also give me the guy who has zero experience like me and cm punk comes a huge name so it makes sense.

Speaker 1:          01:44          It's the only fight to make for Floyd cause condo literally kill them. Yeah, you can't do that because it wouldn't be fair. It's not fair. It's not beat up Floyd and cm punk in the same night. People would understand the difference between Connor Boxing Floyd, which you've got clearly outclassed, but he hit him like Floyd is. I can do anything. No, it's no competition. It doesn't. It's going to be awful. It doesn't make sense. Make sense? He'll get kicked once in the legs and be like, oh my God, now I can't walk and then he gets kicked in the same spot. I'm like, oh Jesus Christ and his folding over and he's getting front kicked in the gut. Connor's talking shit to him. That head kick the viciously and then you're on that highlight reel and the UFC is using that over loop over and over and it takes one clinch.

Speaker 1:          02:24          Just one clinch and you're on on your back. If you're seeing punk than her fighting Floyd, I'm army crawling over Floyd. You're not even, I go ahead and punch me. But Dan Karate style, you stand karate style and you throw sidekicks and you just walk towards him throwing sidekicks. There's so many gifts to the cage. Yes. Why would you even want to box them? You stand total Wonderboy side stance. Just stand like this way back. Liotta Machida style and just throw sidekicks, keep them off you. And then when the move is, whenever it happens, get that client shotty, la, fucking everything. The guy weighs a 145 legitimate pounds. That's what Floyd was even just bear hug them and just pull them on top of me and sweep and we get full amount. I would literally just come at Floyd like this. Just walked straight forward like the terminator two.

Speaker 1:          03:08          Wait. Yeah. He could make welterweight unboxing. He could. That's the only problem with this fight that were spiked lane is 20 pounds. What weight are they going to fight that because see a punks nuts. Small. No, he, he was uh, a legit sized one 70. So he would go and catch weight here. You don't have to be catch weight 60. See that's the other thing. You Drain cm punk down to one 60 and he's Foxville. Yeah, let's do that. Yeah. Well, well, here's the thing. At one 70 he doesn't have a lot of muscle, but he's got a little bit of fat so maybe he might be able to do 65 he does it smart and long, you know, he takes a long time to do it. Adjust as calories, really ramps up as cardio. Just forces himself to do an hour of cardio after every training session.

Speaker 1:          03:50          Has anyone seen him lately? A man looking thinner? No. Just Kinda have to look a lot funner to get that fight. Or Floyd just says, I don't give a fuck. I'm going to like this dude up. Cause when they're standing, when? When he's got to close the distance on cm, Floyd has four ounce gloves on. Are you fucking kidding me? And he's impossible to hit. He's in Pi. You're not going to hit him. That's not happened to catch coming in and it's gonna beat fucking at night night. Even the leg kicks like, boy, can you even kick his legs? How fast the CM punk kick. You know what I mean? We're not talking about like yachts and Clyde. That's not the move for cm punk, sir. Just do what you gotta do to get to the ground. We have a karate background. Cm punk. Yes. Much as a, I have a crowded bar and I'm not making fun of him. When he was like 13 or some shit, I guess doesn't count. I play dodge ball to when the [inaudible] not on my resume, doesn't count. Soccer player. I'm going to put that on my fucking soccer player. My Twitter handle now. I played soccer. Yeah. That doesn't count, man. Play it. Yeah. We were so heartbroken. You're right. Yeah. Jesus. I don't want to throw it. It's that cold brew. This new Cobra was snacking on.

Speaker 2:          05:07          Yeah.
