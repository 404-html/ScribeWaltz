Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. Yeah, most try to come up with the name of it. They're all the same, but all access embedded 24 seven a bed. It's very good. I should, I should remember the name. It's very good. They're all the other on this. This new one is really good cause it's got Max Holloway running on a treadmill, two treadmills over from Norma Madoff who's also running on a treadmill and they're fucking very cool to each other. It's very interesting. It could be thanked him for taking the time, which she should. She should. Thanks for taking the fight. And then they have the same a weight coach like, yeah, that's crazy. Lockhart, right? It's Leah [inaudible] card is d. This is Lockhart working with number of men on this as well. Both of them. So Lockhart was like, Lockhart is legit. Like he goes over calculations of like how much you weigh, how much water you're going to take, and he's weighing things out.

Speaker 1:          00:49          It took them an hour and a half to do the calculations. Yeah. It wasn't like, hey, we're going to wing this. It's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We're going to do this weight cut correctly. And he's got it down to the day, you know, like it's six days to lose. He think he was one 71 is that, is that the, I was wondering what he, what did he start at? Does it when? 71 so I think he's got to lose 16 pounds. What's crazy is when Max was on my show, I was talking to him a little bit off it, and this is on record, on that spilled. Anything that he didn't say, but he just goes, you know, I've, with the injury, Jesus credit embedded, I think it's better than that. UFC, not UFC, the HBO ones. I think it's been 24 seven how dare you, I think it's better than only four seven when there's a big fight generals or blah, I think, well, I think in general they're better because they do more of it.

Speaker 1:          01:38          But a 24 seven they're good. They're fucking good. Very good. Liev Schreiber. Oh, I'd love that Bro. Watch her work. But I like these better. I only cat Liev Schreiber. Yeah. Was like till night air wing girl, but it was nowhere does it say? Yeah, it was horrible this because there's, there's almost no narration, right? Yeah. It's almost just, it tells a story. I want to see the footage. How would it like the video of when they called Max with the fight? Cause from what I heard, he goes, it could be that stuff's getting the world. Fuck yeah, let's go. What? Just saying why don't they have a video of that? But no one knew. I don't think they knew, you know, to to turn the video on. I don't think Max knew what they were calling him. Amazing video of him being like, it's actually few wins.

Speaker 1:          02:21          This is my thing with Max is I think Khabib is the toughest fight in the world on six days notice I'd rather fight anybody else in the world and could be one six days because of this style injures his tenacity. But with Max win, lose or draw, whatever happens Saturday night, if you don't respect and like him even more after this, you're a moron. You're a champions on a run, like Max Holloway's on that would be willing to take this fight on six days notice. And also I should say coming off of a broken foot. Correct. So he had to pull out of a fight with a broken foot with Frankie Edgar. What's just happened? So I mean how he'll dizzy and like it said on my show, he was saying you're not, I've been doing some Jujitsu, been the swing of things for me it's good because I haven't been balls deep in training.

Speaker 1:          03:07          I've just been a little Jujitsu, you know, getting a light workout. But it gives me time with my family and he gives, which he goes, you know this in camp, you're present but you're not, which is true. And he goes, you know, so I'm going through it. I'm, I'm with my son in the family, but I'm thinking about something else. So this has been good for me to really focus on my family. That was what, two weeks ago? Three weeks ago. Wow. So then pay him, you're fine. Could be even the reason why he wants to fight Khabib is cause he thinks could be the best pound for pound fighter in the world. And which is nuts because you know, when you look at it could be Dresner. It's good. It's, it's, it's, it doesn't blow your hair back. He's 25 and Oh for God sakes it's good.

Speaker 1:          03:43          But it's not like all this crazy, you know, big names on his regular. But you talked, I was just in San Jose. John Fitch goes, dude, uh, and this is John Fitch. Yeah. You know, it could be, you know, welterweight goat. He's fucking not cope. He's got damn good. He goes, I've never seen anyone my lifetime like could be. He goes, I fought GSP in his prime. He would beat him. That's how good he is. DC said he's the pound for pound. Greatest fighters ever seen DC said that he had fights with them. Like dcs was the heavyweight Strikeforce champion. He said, he goes, dude, we go to war. We go to war war. Like imagine that DC's a Gar, Willa, he's jacked. I mean, DC's got some body fat on him. He's strong as a fucking ox. You see soak at downtown. So fun to watch. When DC throws Josh Barnett through the air, when they fought Strikeforce, he just go, Jesus handled fight was offensive.

Speaker 1:          04:39          That goddamn American, it was offensive. He ragdolled Hendo and couldn't be a cooler guy like the nicest guy ever. DC might be the nicest fighter of all time. One of my favorite people here and Max, they're up there. I love him for Isis fighters. I don't know Max as well as I would know. Do you see, because I've done so many shows with them, but for DC as good as he is to say that him and Khabib go to war. I'm like, that's crazy to Josh Thompson is the cap ne Kay said, you know Ed Ruth, the Penn state three time national champion freak, just start doing MMA and Beltre complete freak wrestling. He, I was in San Jose and he, yeah, I did a show with him and I go, what were you doing? He goes, I just came from practice. Could be second class practice and go, what was he doing?

Speaker 1:          05:20          He goes, oh, just straight wrestling. I said, uh, who was the restaurant? He was Ed Ruth. I, oh my God, the Penn state like legend. He goes, yeah man, how's that go down? And he's like, and only one of them's gone down and it could be like, what Ruth? And he goes, oh, he goes, bro it, I've never seen anything like it. So there's just this legend of five. They skipped. When they tell me that, it scares me like, well, who do we get to see it in action? When you saw the Barboza fight, he's walking towards him like a Zombie gets a hold of them. And just rag dolls. I'm just rag dolls. But this is what's great about this fight and this what makes our sport so specialist. Yeah, super bombed. I've been in deep depression because Ferguson fell out, and we've talked about this off here, but our sports so special because what Max Holloway has the chance to do Saturday night, if he can beat him, if he can somehow pull that out.

Speaker 1:          06:10          There's nothing like in professional sports, there's nothing like it. If Lebron goes out, the team still goes on. It's whatever. If Tom Brady gets hurt, it sucked. But they still play here. You know, man, Max has a huge chance now are the odds stacked against him? Good God. Are they ever, there couldn't be a worst matchup for him, but what's the one Achilles heel, if there is one for, could beam a guy who can strike going backwards. Max Salaries Pretty fucking good at going backwards. Yeah, it's, it's a fascinating fight. If there was no controversy, if it wasn't like six day time period for him, that's great. I know. It's kind of cool. Do you want, have the fight that's been like, that was a Nate when Nate took on Connor and the first, here's the difference though. Nate's the bigger guy, right? Nate's the bigger guy, the more seasoned guy there.

Speaker 1:          06:56          So for Nate, it's like, yeah, it was short notice, but that's a rough matchup for Connor Connor. It should be an underdog in that fight. They wouldn't find it the same weight class. So that makes it a little more sense. But wait a minute. They do Nate. Nate fights at 55, uh, before that though, he's fine at 70. Right? Oh, no, no, no. He only fought three times at seven, but he saw that 70 is the point. He fired a never fought at 70. Right. But if con when Carter fought him at 70, that was Saturday. Yeah. College. Never funny. You're not 70 pounder. Right. But I mean, Nate, when he fought 70, it didn't go well. I mean, who did he fight? He fought Rory Macdonald. 70. Tough. Who else did he fight? We don't see if I had 70, uh, lost his fights at 70, I think wasn't great at it.

Speaker 1:          07:35          No, he didn't lose all of them. Wasn't great one. Yeah, it wasn't great at 70. How, but the thing is, he's the bigger man. He's a bigger guy. But if they agreed to fight at one 55, he would make the one 55 weight. 100% yes. It's like there was all this talk about him being so much bigger than Conor. Oh, he's bigger for sure. Taller. He's taller. He's amazing. He's a bigger guy. It's around heavier when he gets heavier, but when they fight it 55 he makes that weight. And Connor makes that weight tough too. They both struggled to make one 55 it's a much easier cup for counter at 55 it's not the hardest cut. But when you look at the difference between how he looks physically when he fought Nate at one 70 and how he looks when he's, you know, one 45 he was awful.

Speaker 1:          08:16          I was going to say he's on, Donna can make one 45 naked Nav. I mean there's, there's no problem. He could have made it intimate fighter when it was cut a leg off. You don't have to like real list. He's not making 40 he was very thin during the ultimate fighter days. Remember we have to be, cause you're on marine and fighter, right? So you have to make weight basically three times in a row. Well I just think he filled in too. I mean he was really young back then. 100% but you have to maintain a lower weight. That's the closest fight to it though. I agree with that fight. No, I agree with you. The same kind of balls that Nate has is like what? What it but max that differences that like Max has taken on a guy that everybody's avoiding. No one's been able to, the riddle of Khabib.

Speaker 1:          08:56          No one's even ever even put them in jeopardy like he's, he's like a Johnson hit them, but black rarely wasn't in a while. It was going a bit, we were talking about that the other day. Who knows what was going on in that fight because that was a fight where he had the same issue cutting weight that he did when he had to pull out of the Ferguson fight where body shutdown. Correct. So who knows? He had that same issue with the Michael j. He might've been severely compromised in that fight, even though he beat the fuck out of a great, the difference between Mcgregor and Diaz is the both keeping on the feet really, right? Yeah. He has a phenomenal boxer comes phenomenal striker, Max Holloway phenomena. Striker could be phenomenal grappler. So it's a, it's even more of a task because could be, he's not going to sit there and strike with him.

Speaker 1:          09:34          That's your one way to win. Cool. I'm the best grappler on earth. Yeah. He'll entertain it for a little bit, but if you, if you want you down, there's literally no one in the world from, I'll say one 55 to one seven he's not going to take that. I want to see, I really want to see him in some straight grappling competition to, you're hearing this, hearing that about how amazing is in the training room. I'll tell you it from a guy like DC. I know and and, and Fitch and hops. You're talking about in the hall, pioneers of the sport animals. I want to see him against Woodley at 70 I think 70 is his natural weight class. Yeah. I think he'd probably be a lot healthier. Imagine that. Imagine being stronger and healthcare. It Woodley and Khabib. Jesus. What? But Woodley's a different thing, man.

Speaker 1:          10:16          You, you miss you, you fuck up and you leave yourself in a position to get hit with one of those nuclear bombs. Oh, knock out Woodley could put people to sleep and he can grab his ass, his ass off. Hard to take down and puts people to sleep with one shot. I don't think he gets his due. And I think the best evidence is the two fights that people point to where they say that like Woodley should've done better. Those are the Thompson fights, the end of the my fight. But Maya, it never got hurt like he, he hit my a bunch of times, but it was uneventful cause he was hurt. Woodley was her early in the first round with the shoulder. He fucked his shoulder up, by the way. Should fight my, if you don't want to go to the ground 100% but my point is in those two fights with Thompson Woodley was the one who hurt Thompson.

Speaker 1:          11:00          He hurt him that bad in both fights. Almost stopped him in both fights. Yeah. I don't see them ever fight again, but I hear you. Great Fun. Yeah. I'll pass hard pass where there was a crazy UFC 200 cards that was on it. I wouldn't be mad. He was one of the, as a main event, I get it. I get it. I like twice. Wow. Cool. Yeah. No, that's a super complicated upset, upset though. They're just not good day. It's one and the same thing. If they just said no, this time it's gonna be different. I'm going to war, go to war and then two rounds and you like bastard is circling each other. That's like Dana on a Ferguson and Khabib. He's like, that fights never happened to a fifth time not happening. I'm like, I get it. I get it man. It's such a bummer though.

Speaker 1:          11:46          Let's talk business like, I don't know how many paper views this was going to do, but for the hardcore fans, this was a big one. This was a big one because this is the first time could be biz fighting. A guy that's super versatile, they can fight standing up, can knock you out with one shot. Tough is Falk has incredible endurance and can grab off his back and the most dangerous guy it could be will ever face. Yeah. Tony Ferguson has the perfect style to test what was, so we could really find out where could bebes act cause we know we're Tony's at we and we kind of know where it could bebes at.

Speaker 2:          12:26          Okay.
