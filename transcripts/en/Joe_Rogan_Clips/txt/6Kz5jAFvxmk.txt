Speaker 1:          00:00          The Guy was trying to do that, but with like some Winkeljohn strategy coach these young, he's only like 26 right? He's going to be a prom dress. Super Crystal. I am interim belt stun, Holby POC talking about Colby just had to get a nose operation for sinuses, but this the thing Colby goes and I spoke to someone very close to Colby. Colby goes, dude, I'm down for the fight. I just went five rounds. Willie's been out for how long? Give me, I can do it in October, November. Just let me get ready. I just said I'm going to have sinus surgery is fair and they went, nope. Stripped me of the belt until you want it until it's like, fuck yeah, I'll take it. See that. That seems to be a problem for anybody that's considering taking interim title fight in the future. That's what Paul Ryan Ortega Ortega saw that and he was like, listen, they're offering him before that when his flight got canceled because Max Holloway was running to all those medical issues, they offered him a fight for the interim belt.

Speaker 1:          00:57          And I think it was against Jeremy Stevens is fighting this weekend. They offered Frank Yeager, Andrew Stevens, and so he, Frankie Edwin's crazy. That doesn't even make any sense. That's what Brian said. Yeah. And so then Jeremy and Jeremy Stevens is fucking dangerous. He is sleeping dangerous for anybody. He's doing such a good fighter for antibody. He and he is guns blazing. He's fighting all of this weekend. So on. I know that's a great fight. So at 55 right? All those 40 45 so they offered him all those, those offered him or take up or take a fight with Jeremy because Jeremy is already cut and wait for this fight or you know it training for this fight, which is only a few weeks later. And he says, well, it's an interim title. It doesn't mean anything. I want the real belt fighters. Don't take it serious. Well, here's why they shouldn't now. Right. Well, this is the base example.

Speaker 1:          01:43          Like why would I fight for interim belt? You just strip Kolbe. Now this is us assuming that we know the whole store. Right? I don't know the whole story. I haven't talked to Colby. I haven't talked to Dana, but I don't, I think the conversation, I'm not a fan of the idea of an interim title unless there's extenuating circumstances. Like someone's got a broken leg, they have to be out for six months, but it should be a year out a year. You got to do something so you wouldn't lose out a year. Correct. So that's why it made RDA. It made sense. And also just to play, if I'm Dana, hey Woodley, we need you to fight and you want the super fights turning down fights. What can we do? Let's force the Sand Creek. This interim belt, he's been out a year, which I like. I wasn't talking about that.

Speaker 1:          02:22          I was talking about sign Ortega. Okay, Gotcha. Let's talk about Brian or Tayga because Max Holloway's defended fairly recently and he was getting ready to fight Khabib. It's not like he's been out of law. They offered him that Khabib fight. He tried to cut weight for it and he might have fucked himself that way. Is that what it was? Yeah, it's entirely possible. They're still trying to figure out what happened. Well one of the pieces of speculation is that his body started shutting down because he went through a real bad cut for the, when he was trying to make the cubby fight at 55 on super short notes. That's a hard thing for him to make. 55 is a huge, huge one. 85 what? Yes dude. Max is a big fella. Bribe or Tayga is fucking huge to it goes up to 85 I couldn't really, I stood next to him.

Speaker 1:          03:03          I was like, how big are you in the is bigger, Holly's bigger and so this is the problem with these guys. They need a lot of time to get down to this weight. Right? So how all the way trying to do that. This is one, this is pure speculation, Holly, we to do that is it was very hard for him. His body broke down and then in cutting weight for this fight, once his body started the water load, his body knew what was going on and start shutting down. This is speculation, pure Spec, but here's my point. You can't make me and let and let until you know that he's going to be out for a certain amount of time. It seems like an interim title belt is almost disrespectful. Like he's, he's, the champ makes zero sense. But I think it was a corporate decision find out, but I feel like it was a corporate decision where they went, okay, we have to fight.

Speaker 1:          03:46          We need to fill this gap. We have to fight. Well, it has to buy somebody. Of course we get, you're talking about something different. Yeah, but I'm saying, I'm saying they go, they go, we want this gotta be a ton of fight. How about use? Okay. How about you have this, how about you give you the Colby retains his interim title because there's extenuating circumstances with him medically. He had to get nasal surgery. He's out until November. Colby gets the next shot. Whoever the fuck wins his fight. Colby fights neck straight. See, but you haven't talked to her boy Dana. Maybe he's saying that maybe every same stripped UBB. Listen, fuck your belt, but you will get the next shot. Everyone's just taking your buy it hers and they did some, well maybe it was Uzma Uzma and wants to fight till next and he's like, let's do this for the real number one contender spot.

Speaker 1:          04:29          Cause Uzman is a guy who has quietly been beating everybody they put in front of yes. His last one he has and I love him. His last fight I wasn't the most exciting. But if you go through, you know who my has fought, you look at the way Colby. Did he look prior to that? You know, you Uzman would have the worst argument but he has the eye. The most potential probably like he's a not, no one wants to fuck off for the Damien Maia fight. I wouldn't agree with you because both guys beat Damien might before that was not good. I'm saying that their decisions right. It's not like he was, he wasn't telling people I meant the, before the Damien Maia fight with Colby, Colby didn't have a lot of big names on his resume. He had one decision. Damien Maia. So like, what do we got here? I beat Damien Meyer as well in his last fight.
