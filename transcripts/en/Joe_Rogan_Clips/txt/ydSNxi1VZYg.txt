Speaker 1:          00:00          Heads and it's a star wars one at Disneyland, Dude. It's fucking why you go across, you're walking across you, you can really get a workout with that. I'm not joking. You get exhausted. Yeah. And you know, you, you keep going and fight tougher and tougher opponents, right? Well, yeah, that's it. And that's the quite, you know, so like talk about haptic suits, like where eventually you know you're going to wear things. I didn't see the, I read the book but I didn't see the, uh, what was it? The movie that ready, set ready player one. I didn't see it either. They didn't see you have you read the book? The book's really good because the book is like full immersion. Like the whole book is about like when virtual reality is it. And so everybody has the suits that, you know, and you're kind of in this ball, you play the game in a boiler, you can run and you know, um, but in some sense, yes, we're just starting out along these lines, but they have these places you can go, they have a warehouse set up and you go inside of it.

Speaker 1:          00:47          And I went through one with my kids. And it's a star wars one at Disneyland, Dude. It's fucking why you go across, you're walking across this platform, like they have all these different places where you actually walk through and as you're walking through, you look to the left and to the right and there's fire, but you feel the heat from the fire. It's fucking crazy. Like heater set up so that it blows up and storm troopers starts shooting at you. This is it right here. What is it called? The void. The void. Yeah. And you do this. I'm telling you man, this is better than any of the rides at Disneyland and it's just outside of Disneyland and downtown Disney. So you don't have to pay to get into Disney and you get it. But it costs, I think it's $35 for a half an hour. It's not cheap, but it's not too bad.

Speaker 1:          01:31          It's not too bad. Like it's fucking awesome. I mean it is awesome. And so the question is what happens with all of this, right? Future, right? Cause you have virtual reality. We're just on the cusp of it. Right. We're just beginning to like start playing around with these technologies because people have been saying it for years and it kind of sucked. It was sort of clunky. We're, we used to play Pong, right? That's what I started with. How old are you? 55 yeah, I'm 50 so I remember Pong. We were excited. I can't believe I'm controlling the TV, making the thing move on the TV or asteroids slew the, Oh yeah. Was a star wars game, I think it was called asteroids. But you flew through the trenches wire frame, but it was amazing. I dropped a lot of quarters. Sure. So go from that to what you were showing us here with these crazy new space games.

Speaker 1:          02:16          And then imagine what these mean. The star wars thing today, the void is really cool, but you know that it's not real, but it's cool. Right. But you know it's not real. Well, you're not going to be able to tell. It's not real in 20 years. Yeah. Right. And how much time are you willing to spend it, by the way, when you do that? Oh really pressure you and you feel it when you get getting shot. Wow. You feel like, I never, you know, it's funny, even with the controller on my crappy ps four who, um, yeah, but it vibrates when you, you know, sort of give you, it's amazing how much the brain sort of picks up on these signals when you're using the HTC vive and you draw an Arrow back. When it gets to the nocking point, you feel it, like you release, there's a feeling in your hand and you're seeing the arrow.

Speaker 1:          03:00          It's really cool. Yeah. So what happens when, and you're right, I can be sorta like, you know, you're like, that's terrible. People shouldn't be going out in nature, which I think they should be. They should, you know, now, but, you know, I always, I'm always aware whenever I'm sort of like, oh shit, this is gonna be terrible. I always remember the whole, you can see it in like, I think at some point, Socrates, you know, 2005 years, 500 years ago, it was like, Ooh, kids to do the role. Bunch of old. Right. Um, so you know, who knows what we'll do with it and you know, hopefully, you know, maybe it'll help, you know, maybe, I don't know. You know, I mean I think there is, I don't want to be like, oh that's terrible, but there clearly are is going to be dangerous with just a different game.

Speaker 1:          03:34          Jamie this is a new one. Oh boy. Fuck I, I'm going to be fucked shooting at these yet. Just the hands. Yeah. And so your, you have two little hand controllers and one of them would be the Arrow and the other one would be the bow and you wear them and that's the haptic part and it'll controllers on them. Well you feel the Arrow vibrating against the riser of the row as you draw it back to. It's really cool. Well it's funny cause you know we talked about like you know, for the the game that we built, which was awesome. It was really a lot of fun to actually go through the process of like how do you, how do you script it? How do you teach people, you know, like, cause that whole thing that when we get in a good way, when you're a good game, right?

Speaker 1:          04:13          You know, the first couple hours of a game and you're just learning the basic stuffs and you get excited, you're like, oh this is, this is a cool world to be in. Um, but I'd be interested to think like sort of, you know, at some point did tried VR for the same thing because what can you, once you can tap, have people be tactile and then have to sort of in their head, what else can you do to short of show them, teach them things you know, like glaciers or you know, I mean sure. Well that's another thing in Disneyland they have a thing called soaring over the world that you sit in a chair and you, you get raised up and there's a giant like imax style screen and it flies you over these environments. It's incredible. It's so beautiful and different smells are in the air and the different places that you go to.

Speaker 1:          04:50          Like when you go over the elephant, the elephant's you smell grass and hay. And, um, I think that it's just a matter of time, like as we were talking about before where biological entities might not be necessary for space travel. You might be able to send a robot, put on a suit and be able to experience these worlds, right? Like in real time. Well, um, so you know, you know, the simulation argument, the philosophy argued about the, you know, and so that's a really interesting idea. Should we just run through it for people who don't know, so I forgot who it was, Nick Bostrom and now maybe not Brandon Carter. You know, there's this, uh, this guy philosopher came with this brilliant argument for like, why we're probably a simulant, we're probably somebody else's simulation, self aware of simulation. And the idea is like, look, if you get one, you know, we've been talking about like civilizations, when they get a million years ahead, what can they do that they're so powerful, they can build computers that can simulate reality, like fully simulate reality where like, you know, just like in the matrix, you have programs that are self aware and so, you know, once they get to that and they start running simulations of the world, right?

Speaker 1:          05:51          It's cheaper to run. It's cheap to run simulations. So they just run trillions of them, right? So the idea is that from that argument there's more simulated realities then there is the one real reality. So odds are right, you know, if there's a trillion simulated realities and one real reality, you're probably in a simulated reality. So are we a, you know, everything like right now you, and I think this is real, you know, but what we are is an incredibly detailed and we are self aware programs in silicon matrix of, you know, uh, so that argument is brilliant. I mean, you know, I mean just from the, just from the point of view of like numbers, um, yeah, there's lots of reasons to say that's not possible, but, but it's, you know, raises this issue of like, yeah, what is simulation? But if you are in a simulation, the whole matrix thing, if you are in a simulation that was that real, how would you know?

Speaker 1:          06:39          Yeah, how could you know there are gay, we're going to be, if you allow technology to continue, right? If we keep moving forward at an exponential pace, there's gonna come a point in time what we have something that's indistinguishable from reality, right? So how do we know that we're not already in it? Once we're in it, will we create another reality? Will we continue to create simulations inside of simulations like fractals, fractals exist nature, they exist everywhere in the universe. And there's, there's also the argument that the atomic structure itself might really be a universe. Right? Right. Yeah. That's super stoner talk. But you know, it's really, I mean, what, that's why I love science fiction, you know, the explorations of these ideas, you know, I mean they're way out there and there, but know exercises, exercises. And there's a way in which again, when you think 1,000,002 million years in the future, this is why might one of, you know, I hate the loop this back to climate change, but just like God, if we could just make it through, who the fuck knows what we're going to be.

Speaker 1:          07:35          Right. I mean there's, there's the whole universe. One thing I did like about, um, interstellar, what's the idea that like our future selves, which have now become integrated, the very fabric of reality, you know, that's how far you've evolved. You become the laws of physics that they're kind of opening up the wormhole for us. And so, you know, a million years is so long and that know who knows what we can become and it's just like, you know, don't hold us back. I mean, I'm, you know, I'm not a fan of the people that deny science, but one thing I am a fan of is watching them do it. Like watching monkeys throw shit at the zoo. It's just something weird about watching people argue like really obvious, right wing talking points and, and, and most of them, by the way, have no financial interest in climate change one way or the other. They're not, they're not the wealthy elite. There are these Weirdos that are like the empire familiars like they want to be recognized as like an eight, an ally of the elite. They think somehow knew that that was going to get to, and it's really what it is, right? Yeah.
