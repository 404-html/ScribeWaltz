It's a wrap. That's a wrap on that. Well, he's 40 years old trying to him to compete in something that's a young man's game. That's the thing. It's like you can get mad, you can get outraged and that's a reasonable result are reasonable response if you want. But if you rationalize, if you have empathy, it's like this guy still wants to do this thing that his body won't allow him to do and so he's willing to, to bend the rules to attempt it. He failed and now he's going to have to pay the consequences. Yeah. It's a month after his knock out. Lost a Volkov. Right. Volkov fuck to mom. Dangerous there guys.

This is a crazy picture of Afghanistan and extra professional basketball player and a god who looks like a tiny person. So weird. It got who it looks like. I look when I stand next to him. Not quite as much contrast, but pretty ridiculous, but there it is. Look at that. That's, I mean, that's fucking crazy. We just, there's, there's more always, but I have a Chihuahua and a Chihuahua, and you have your, your doc, you put them beside each other and you're like, that can't be the same species. I know.
