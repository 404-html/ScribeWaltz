Speaker 1:          00:00          Who attributed or some people at least are attributing that to Gingiss con killing some somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% of the population on Earth Dam. One out of 10 he killed more people than aids. Yeah, definitely. Right. How many people did AIDS kill it? If you had to guess someone was just talking about that recently and say, no one should die from HIV anymore. No one should die of AIDS. It literally shouldn't have to happen anymore. And that crazy. This take medication now we were kids. Everybody was terrified at aids. AIDS was a death sentence while eating Twinkies, terrified of aids while eating that thing that slowly killing you. Terrified of getting some aids. Chubby little kid gets it. Everybody who doesn't want to go to school no more. Remember that one kid go to school. Yeah, the magic God in there. But they were though, right?

Speaker 1:          00:48          Magic. Got It. I remember being in my car. I was in my car. I was living in revere Massachusetts right here. Yeah. This uh, apartment complex and I was driving my car and I was on the hot. I was on the road listening to the radio like you know, you see where the traffic lights are, you see, you see, you remember it's like burned in your brain. Like Ah, Magic Johnson has aids. What in my car? That's what I remember thinking like it was a scene in a vampire movie monster movie or something like a Zombie outbreak. Like, oh my God, now it's, it's reached one of the greatest basketball players of all time. This is insane. Are people going to just start dropping off like flies? Now I'm going to start. We just thought we didn't condoms right away afterwards. I don't think so. We need, you know, animals bro Savage, the savage.

Speaker 1:          01:44          I mean there's a reason why there's 7 billion of us. We stop. People need to stop pretending that when they're, you know, full fully aroused that they're thinking straight like you, you are operating at about like 10% of your normal resources. I see. Like A's, whatever. Who's got aids? He still got A's after they got rid of it with a code. Well, you know, it's crazy that it was just primarily gay people in drug users that we're getting it. It's what a weird disease man. That's a, that's a weird one. Men, that's a strange thing that you're, you're, when your body starts weakening and shutting down like Whoa. But when you really think about the actual danger and death, like I think even while aids was in its height of killing people, I don't think it was killing people as much as the flu was right.

Speaker 2:          02:37          The numbers I'm finding now or depending on worldwide or u s so worldwide tuberculosis is now killing more people than aids. But uh, this says that only 1.1 million people today in the u s are living with aids. And I think I saw,

Speaker 1:          02:53          but living with aids, it's like you're at the border of getting aids. Is that what it is? It's like, yeah, you have h supposedly this and again, I'm not a doctor, right? Supposedly it's like you have HIV, your, your immune system gets weakened. You catch aids, which is acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which means your t cell levels have reached a certain count where they identify it as aids, right?

Speaker 2:          03:17          Yeah. It actually did type in aids and this is going to HIV. So, so those that's, they're definitely connected. So it's not people that also their immune system fails. That's outside of HIV. Yeah. This, so I clicked on this, I'll show what I clicked on it. So I typed in that end, and this is showing this, it says at 1.2 million people, I've received an aids diagnosis since the early eighties

Speaker 1:          03:38          since the early eighties okay. So 1 million people. And there have been 12,000 in 2014 there were 12,333 deaths due to any cause of people with diagnosed HIV infection. Ever classified as AIDS. And hmm. What does that mean? You had it then at 6,000 weird way of saying it with people. Well, I'll say it again. It says there were 12,333 deaths due to any cause of people with diagnosed HIV infection. Ever classified as AIDS. Isn't that a strange way of saying that? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          04:19          With the, I don't know what that means. You can lose it to the classification if your immune system gets strong enough.

Speaker 1:          04:23          It says with diagnosed HIV infection ever classified as AIDS.

Speaker 2:          04:29          Okay. Are the, I don't know, maybe I'm too stupid for that because what I also saw was that a million people died last year from it, but that'd be worldwide. And this then contradicts, cause it says a million people have only been diagnosed and this is only in the US and that other numbers worldwide. So it gets really sketchy. And it says

Speaker 1:          04:44          thousand 721 deaths were attributed directly to HIV. Yeah. So it seems that they, they definitely think it's still killing people. Definitely still is, but yeah. But what is, how many people die from the flu every year? What do you, what do you would you think would be the most, the route, most ruthless, normal killer would be the flu. The flu would kill the most people 36,000 way more way more people got jacked by the flu every year, every year. And what was the number from the aids number was total. Right. How many of those people that flu shots though? What is it? How many of those?

Speaker 2:          05:24          And then 2014 so it's a third or so. So what's a third aids to the flu. AIDS is about one third of the deaths of the flu per year. Ish on average. I don't know

Speaker 1:          05:37          that. Interesting. It's like we're not scared of the thing that kills us from way more. We're really scared of the thing that kills less people because it kills him through butts. Eggs. That's what it is. It has to be, we're terrified that it kills people through sex because like the flu, it is like we should really be concentrating on that thing. That thing's killing way more people. People not washing their hands, but they're like, look, we can't stop that, but we can stop off his buttocks. Weird. Right. It's weird, like when we, maybe it's just because it's a new thing that was killing people because it didn't exist and then it did exist. That's probably what it is, right? Yeah. Like yeah, because it came out of nowhere because it was in like, what was it during the 80s and the Eddie Murphy is dead and you're walking around with the A's on your lip.

Speaker 1:          06:30          Oh, was that, was that delirious? Do you remember Sam kinisons bid on it? He goes, they say, Sam, you shouldn't make fun of AIDS aid. Sam has a communicable disease. Straight people can get it too. He goes, name what name? Hey Fuck. It's not our dads. He had this crazy dangerous bit about it and like way back then like whoa. It's like a cro in around like 1980 I don't know if that's accurate, but so 1980 was the highest peak in thousands. So yeah, it seems like the low, it seems like it seems like late seventies right? Is that somewhere around 1980 the one thing too, I read that there's around 300,000 total deaths and a third of them are in New York, 300,000 total deaths, a third in New York and the flu. And this is all told ever. Again, the stats are all on multiple pages. So here's how many of them I see.

Speaker 1:          07:26          I get so confused about all this shit because some people believe that a lot of these people also are shooting heroin. A lot of these people were also doing a lot of drugs. I would wonder, you know, if they're really partying hard and they also get aids, I would. I would always wonder like how much of you partying hard is destroying your immune system too. Like if you're, if you have a disease, like say you have cancer and you're struggling with cancer and you just decided to hardcore start smoking meth and then you die from the cancer. Like is it doesn't, didn't something else kill you too. Right. Not saying that the cancer is good for you. Cancer certainly bad for you, but if you have cancer and you just decided to go on a meth binge and destroy your immune system, it's got to contribute to your health, but we don't consider that.

Speaker 1:          08:15          We all consider up. They'll fucking cancer. Got Him. Cancer got him. It did get him. It definitely did get him, but he was also smoke and math all day feeling good. Doing robberies, robberies with fucking skulls painted on. It's getting more fights at seven 11 yeah, man, he was amped. Dude was amped with cancer. That's, that's also, I mean if he dies of a heart attack, I all the cancer gave him a heart attack. Yeah, probably that probably had something to do with it. Definitely was not good. It's definitely not good to have cancer, but it's also not good to be smoking math while you have cancer spoken. Beth, that bat, so how many of these people that got aids were like extremely healthy folks that like jogged on a regular basis and ate a lot of fruit and vegetables are hard to get that data.

Speaker 1:          09:00          Yeah, I know. I would like to get that data. This is not like a prejudice perspective. I'm just as a curious person, I would like to get all that. I would like to know what is it that actually does it? Is it, is it the math that kills you? Is it a d a disease that kills you? Is it a combination of all these things? We always want to attribute death to one thing, but I would imagine that with all the people that have died of the flu, there's certain, there's a number of deaths. We look at the flu. You're like, man that the flu could just catch you. The flu could just catch you and you know, catch you when you're already week two, maybe your, your rundown, you've been working too much and then the flu hits you when your immune system's devastated and it gets deep into you and gets you.

Speaker 1:          09:42          I, everybody's vulnerable. I mean the, the thing about diseases that so strange to me, he said, some of them are associated with certain certain groups of people like aids. Like AIDS is one of those ones. It's just so associated with gay people that it's like a really politically charged disease and we concentrate on it like really heavily. But I think it, I really think it wasn't just the gay thing was also that it was, it was new, new, there was a new thing that was killing people that day. We were always worried about that. Right. There's always these pandemic movies were some new crazy disease breaks loose, just runs ramp and we don't have an immune system for it. People are start dying and they need to get the medication to the people and get it to the baby quickly. Ah, we made people saw a subways, SARS, just always some shit like that.

Speaker 1:          10:24          We're all SARS of some new shit that's going to get us swine flu, chicken flu, so that, well, so aids had a duel, a disadvantage one that is connected to gay people and people are like, oh, what are they doing over there? What are they not going to get it? I'm not gay. Yeah, exactly. There was that and then there was also, well blood transfusions, car accidents. That's right. Right. People were worried about getting from blood transfusions, so that means back then they were never, they were like, they were just letting random people donate blood without checking it. I don't think they had a test for and for awhile. I think for a while they didn't have a task for it. Then they have to find like, I guess they have to find like antibodies in your blood or some shit and like, Ooh, but it's so weird that while this is all going on, how many people were dying from cancer every year just from smoking cigarettes?

Speaker 1:          11:11          It's fucking crazy numbers. Crazy numbers. People dropping like flies and no one thinks about that. When you see a guy smoking a cigarette, you don't think that guys killing themselves. You're like, God, he's outside and for the restaurant and having a cig normal shit. Now that guy's, that guy's poisoning it himself like a guy who the weak livers. But it's just strange to me. Like we get really specific about what fears we have in terms of what way we die. And when a new disease comes along, that becomes like one of the most specific ones. But while you're indulging in all of these behaviors, that will also kill you in way larger numbers than diseases. It's fucking weird, man. It's very weird. But human beings, me included, were so strange.
