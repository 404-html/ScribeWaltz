Speaker 1:          00:00          Her low freak bitches and if you listen to Jordan Peterson, he knows so much about Marxism that it's it, it shows you like, oh this is a pattern of human thinking. It starts off by people that were really like well intentioned. They're intellectuals, they're very kind, they're sympathetic, they're progressive and they want everyone to be nice. So one of the ways they do it is to be really evil to people they think are not nice. And then you create this fucking war cause they look at them as predators and there it's, that's that sort of like infantiles the date. The problem is that people in the other side don't look at it that way. So you're starting this thing and you're creating two short up defenses and walls of offense. You, you start, you push in, you start Molotov cocktail in universities that to given speeches by guys who were Republicans, you create a, like that UC Berkeley that went happened with Milo.

Speaker 1:          00:49          I just pulled them out of the fucking building to save his life. Yeah. He did $100,000 worth of damage to the school for thinking. I thought, I thought Berkeley was so tolerant. How, what a surprise. As long as you don't get along hearts on fire, they make cars. Ireland. Milo was there and so we got shadows. Yes. Some kind of shy bias. Yeah, no, it's, it's crazy. And if you listen to what he's saying, he's saying some racist Shit, right? Not nothing compared to the reaction. And it's getting nothing. He's mostly half of a troll. He's like half of a comedian when he says things, he's bitchy. He's a bitchy gay guy. They called him a Nazi and he's a fucking gay Jew. It is one of the funniest things ever. They're calling this Guy Nazi and a white supremacist slogan of his tour. Loates intense, dangerous faggot tour.

Speaker 1:          01:34          But he, but he's gay. He's gay. And he talks about his love of black Dick. You know, he talks about how no, he's up of writer and a troll, but like a, an intelligent troll and a British guy who's got people on, if you look at what the athletes yeah. And they said it was because he said a rude, racist shit. Organize some sort of an attack on Leslie Jones, but he didn't do it. Like if you look at what he said, if, if, how responsible is someone who cracks a joke about someone, like he said something about Leslie Jones wouldn't be the first time I was, I was, uh, in Saul turned down by a black man. Like, like something along those lines, like bitchy but funny. And for that, just for that, for saying that because she was mad at his review or something along those lines that his followers started sending her horrible come maybe.

Speaker 1:          02:22          But how much of that can you push on to him? They can't control that. You can't control it. So I'm not, what I'm saying is if you look at what he actually said, if that's grounds for a band, we're dealing with some extreme censorship. So you've got to figure out like, when is he responsible? See did he say, hey guys, go get him. No, he didn't. But you know who did do that is Leslie Jones. There was a tweet or Leslie Jones, someone was attacking her and she's like, go get them to that person. Like [inaudible] which is like, look, that's her prerogative too. If you want to be a cut and started attacking this woman who's a very hilarious comedian for no reason, she, I think she should be able to say fuck you and do it publicly and say go get him so fence. So my, my low never said that Milo literally never said go get him, but yet he was sort of held responsible for things that other people said.

Speaker 1:          03:10          You can't, there's so many crazy people out there. The idea that you can control them and then you could just like say like people who like Brian Cowen, you are responsible for those people. You have to set a good example. We're going to kick you off our platform. That's essentially what this crazy, it's weird, it's their prerogative. But pull up 20 actually silence. I think it's interesting and yellow actually said, you know that you're not going to change. We always have to remember that if you disagree with the other side, the idea is to try to get them to agree with you or try to come up with some kind of a consensus. So you can move ideas forward and move the world forward. And what we have with this kind of reaction to Milo is if you're going to do $100,000 worth of damage in your protest, well that's fine.

Speaker 1:          03:47          And Milo have to be escorted out and you won't listen to them and you close your mind. You're not moving anything forward or making anything better though. You're just creating a big old division. And I guess you guys can stay in your echo chamber. They'll stay in their echo chamber and nobody will listen to each other and we won't learn anything. Well that's just a product of being raised in this system, this two party system and this ridiculous idea that there's us and them and now that they're in, there's this, you know, all people have to fight back and you have to punch Nazis. So this crazy shit that people are saying. But when you listen to what Milo actually says, even if you disagree with them, which I do all the time, like I disagree with a lot of what he's saying, Hah, there's Sam Harris put it best.

Speaker 1:          04:26          He's like, half of it is like a performance. It's like he seems insincere a lot of the times and he's very acutely aware that is generating a response and the things that he's saying that they're saying like, you know, that they're saying that he's racist or he's just as terrible white nationalists or something like this is they're just making stuff up so that they can start attacking him more freely because it's easier. What he said is definitely controversial. Controversial, he said is some of it is definitely rude. Some of it is preposterous. Some of it doesn't make any sense. Like he's, he's pro circumcision because he doesn't want Dick's to have extra skin hanging off of him. He says he'll fight with you about it. You know, he's, he's, he's a, uh, Catholic. I think he is. I'm like, okay, that's fun. I believe that.

Speaker 1:          05:06          He's like, absolutely, Catholicism is the best religion. It's the most amazing religion. I'm super like, he's crazy. Okay. So he started making front of Jones and we wrote an article, first of all, let's say one thing that he wrote an article, uh, where he did a horrible, like a mean critique of the new Ghostbusters for women. And he said essentially that it was like a feminist film. And he pointed out some really important shit. He's like, every guy in the movie is a fucking idiot and every woman's saves the world. And he's like, it's kind of ridiculous. So He's, he says, um, he writes this. So she was getting hate mail from his response, I guess from his thing, racial abuse, abuse that she was getting. And he said, everyone gets hate mail for funds for fuck sake. One tweet read another one called Jones, barely literate.

Speaker 1:          05:49          Later she shared fake screenshots. Oh, he shared fake screenshots that made it appear of Jones. We're making profane and offensive postings. Twitter didn't say exactly why at Bandy Annapolis only telling Breitbart writer that he was permanently banned for violation of the company's rules prohibiting participation in or exciting targeted abuse of individuals. So what makes that like, okay. I could see like if he was post retweeting things that, that were very rude. I will have to see what those things were. Probably proceed how rude they were. Maybe they were silly. They were racist. They were bad. They were bad. They were crazy. Or on the seat making it appear that the Jones link there, Jamie, scroll back down to see where it says it. Made it appear of Jones were making profane and offensive postings. Click on that. Let's see what it looks like. What it, what was actually said.

Speaker 1:          06:44          This was not me. Okay. Okay. Uncle Tom. Fag Nero needs to get his racist ass out. My mentions shit like this makes me think we need to gas got Goddamn faggots sit down. Okay, so it's not really hurts fake. Yeah. Somebody made a fake. That's kind of fucked up to do to Leslie Jones. Terrible. Well, how do we know? Okay, you got to assume that he knew that that wasn't him. Right. Posted one that that wasn't her brother, but hold on, hold on. Hold on. We got assumed that. Go back to that again. Jamie, you got to assume that he knew that that wasn't really her. Right? You don't think that he really thought she wrote that? So if he retweets that, if that's a fake account, what's the diff? Okay, so it's just a photo that someone said or did he, someone else did it and he tweeted it.

Speaker 1:          07:27          He retweeted it, I guess. Okay, so let's see what the other ones are. Although it says it looks like it's verified as well as dog. Did He retweet this? If someone sent it to him and he retweeted. Okay, here's one less dog. You're Ghostbusters just in the first to have an ape in it. Oh Shit. Super Racist. That is, whoa. It's awful. So he retweeted that. He retweeted that. Okay. Yeah. That's not cool. That's pretty fucking rude. That's again, what, what else we got. That's, that's, that's, that's just shitty man. That makes me not like, just that makes me want to put this on him. He's definitely got some issues. He's got some fucking issues. We were good. We get it. You get it. Well that's, he's definitely got some issues like that. That's not a cool thing to do. But what he's doing, he insights talk and because of that his, his book is now number one on the Amazon, the salads you trying to accomplish what's the property sale and no one knows it hasn't book isn't even out yet.

Speaker 1:          08:21          Yeah, it's really, really interesting guy and a lot of ways. He's very smart. I talked him off hair. He's a very intelligent guy and he's very cordial, very good to talk to. I really enjoyed talking to him and I, we joked around a lot when we did the podcast together cause I grilled them about certain things I think are ridiculous and eventually it gives him, starts laughing with you. He's a very smart guy, but I don't know what he's doing. I don't know if this is a real as the real him or if this is him doing a performance or if it's combination of both or if he's finding himself in the midst of this hurricane of negativity and popularity, which would it be just assuming that he's bulletproof, that he can't be influenced by this fucking crazy or deal that he's going through. And occasionally do shit that he shouldn't have done.

Speaker 1:          08:59          Like reposting some horrible racist thing is young. I mean he's maybe 30 something. Right? How old is my life? You made a point. That's a really good point. You just said that made about if this is like in transition, like so sure he is. He's a growing just like all of us are. And even like, it depends on how you can catch somebody in, in a, in a moment where they can sound if you, they already sound not like themselves. So he's young. He's 23. He's fucking smart, dude. I'm telling you. I believe it. I just feel like, yeah, I definitely disagree with retweeting that racist picture of Lizzy Jones looking like a gorilla. This one guy who said something, he was at the, uh, when, what was the theater in France that they shot up during a performance? He was in the band, I believe it's Christ.

Speaker 1:          09:38          Yeah. So remember when, when those guys opened fire the life contracts deaf, famous, famous, famous, yeah. Death metal. And he said something about Islam right after that he was like, he's in and he was emotional and people that dive and it was his concert and he saw some all kinds of stuff and he said something that they picked up and he did an interview cause they just did a documentary on it and he said something really interesting. They said, you said something about Islam, do you have any regret about that? And it was pretty racist. And he said, all right, well look, first of all, I love people. We have a lot of Muslim fans. Anything else said what happened there was my emotions were so heightened and there was a, there was a, there was a span of time where I was thinking in a very emotional, uncharacteristic way that I usually am my, I had, I was hot off of something tragic and I didn't even know how to make sense of it.

Speaker 1:          10:37          I don't want you to reread what I said because that's not who I am. But in that sliver of time, that's how I was feeling and I lashed out in pain. It's very honest way of putting it is, and I thought that's, that's why we have to be careful about taking quotes and then applying that to a person's entire Caribbean Myeloma. This was a guy in the band after he said something about Islam, but, but it made me think about that. We do this all the time where we say, you said that one thing, you said a sentence, let's let's highlight that and let's just say that's who the man is. You know? You got to be careful. Sometimes you'll be held accountable for what you do. Eating good deal. We can't always give everyone a pass, but I'll call. He's just going through a rough time.

Speaker 1:          11:15          It's all good. It's drill. You're going to be held accountable to. That's true too. That's true too. But we also have to recognize that like at 33 years of age, especially, dude, I was a moron when I was 33 and if I had gotten drunk and I decided to retweet some shit, thank God Twitter wasn't around then I want to say the stern of the ship that young and if he's a smart yes it is. You say stupid shit all the time. Hold on. Just doing stupid shit. I've never retweet anything racist. All 33 you know you're not racist. No, not a Rawls, but with them, this is the pattern. Maybe you don't get a free house. Here's the thing, man. He's his whole thing is courting controversy. That's essentially what he's doing by saying feminism is cancer. He's organizing a fist fight. He's calling them out and he's organizing a verbal [inaudible] probably on Adderall.

Speaker 1:          12:00          So he's talking a hundred miles an hour. He's really articulate and he's gay and he looks fabulous and he's got bleach blonde hair and he wears clothes and when he's killing it, like on stage, he's a very good order. So he's engaging them in these debates that he's got carefully thought out, responses, carefully thought out sentences about what he's doing. He definitely knows what he's doing. He definitely knows. How was your conversation with Henry Rollins? Speaking of articulates, getting a little pointy with this racism thing. Look at Maria. Oh I love that. He's a good looking guy. Handsome fellow. Hell, a profound love of black Dick. He talks about it all the time, which is also one more way that they have a hard time attacking him cause he's a gay Jew that loves black Dick. Like he's got the spectrum covered. He's like, there's a triangle invincibility that's around him.

Speaker 1:          12:50          Brian's up. These are good talking. One time Brian's not. You go off. Oh Man, I am happy. I'm alright man. You can't. This is, this is what fascism is. You can't enforce your view of the world on people through violence because that's what you're doing when you're a fascist. And that's what people need to understand. Like you can't just use the word fascist when it applies to right wing people. If you're keeping people from communicating, you're keeping a gay Jew from talking shit on your stage and you can't just counter what he's saying with someone who's better at talking shit. That is better points. So instead you want to throw a chair through the window at fucking Starbucks. Look, stop. You guys are fascist. I know you don't stink your fascists. Even if you think you're right the way you're doing it, it's 100% wrong. This isn't the guys on a Nazi.

Speaker 1:          13:38          He's not someone who's, even if he had said a racist thing in the past, he's not the first. Every fucking comedian said racist shit. Let's dog had herself had a bunch of racist shit. They pulled off her Twitter page. We don't hate her for that. She had a bunch of shit about white people, just generalizing about white people in in general. If you ever did that about black people, you would get blackballed from Hollywood for life, of course. But we will allow a certain amount of stupid shit to come out of people's mouths if we think that you're not a bad person. Yeah. And if you disagree, if you disagree with somebody the way you beat it, I'll say it again. The way you beat a bad idea is with a better I don't do is you don't start this fucking meme of punch Nazis.

Speaker 1:          14:16          Like everybody keeps saying punch Nazis. Like don't say that. You're talking punched on there though. Girls. You see that girl getting maced in the face? She the up make bitcoin great again hat and they came up and maced Mesa in the face cause it looked like a make America great again when she fucked up where it doesn't matter man. They know I'm in a fucked up Peter in the head with a sign and another guy may stir in the face they're ruthless to they weren't ruthless with is our boy Jake shields. He was at the protest that I didn't get maced. He's lucky he didn't get mason the faith that they ran the tray. You need more. You need more than mace to fight Jake shields. No problem with Macy's. You can't see. And if people just jump on you and you can't just look, Jacob, probably Jack, 90% of them that come anywhere near them.

Speaker 1:          15:01          If you can't, if you can't see and someone hits you over the back of the head, but something, yeah, these fucking people are doing exactly what they would hate. And when I see people, like there's people that been calling out for a COO, they're calling out for a military coup. They're calling out for them. I've seen more than one person say this, like the military needs to step in and take our country back. And I'm like, Holy Shit, this is a Patrick Swayze movies from the 80s they're shaking exactly the way a fascist would or a tire and would they just have a different target. Right. That's what I always say to people. It's amazing how many people think exactly like their enemy. Exactly like their enemy. I want to kill all of them or whatever. And yet they're just, the only difference is they have a different target.

Speaker 1:          15:39          It's crazy when you have a legitimate contest, right? You had a legitimate popularity contest and one guy wins and you're not happy that the guy wins. So you want to start riots like you might, you might have fucked up and not voted, or you might not have done such a good job of picking a candidate or you might've had the wrong campaign, but you have to, except when someone wins. Otherwise, there's no fucking point in having this contest. We have this contest every four years and if you don't accept to one, as long as it's not this, the cheating, whatever the cheating happened, it probably happened on both sides. Whatever legal shit they got away with whatever shenanigans and the PR they did to him with the whole, uh, grab 'em by the pussy thing and all that. I mean, there's, there's a tax left and right on both sides.

Speaker 1:          16:21          He came out ahead. People aren't happy. I understand that people are unhappy, but you can't think that you can start a riot now because you didn't want him to be in there. They had a stupid fucking contest. He won stupid fucking contest. The problem is you're having a stupid fucking contest to see who runs the world. And also it's important to have a little compassion for the other side in this terms. Like I constantly hear Trump voters being characterized as homophobes rednecks, dumb hillbillies and all that stuff cause they're in there, they're in the mix and they're there. They're in the mix in every, on both sides of the categories. Here's the thing, it might also be worth taking a little bit of a human approach and looking at Trump voters and a maybe a lot of Trump voters may be a lot of Trump voters who are good people didn't like Trump that much either.

Speaker 1:          17:05          But they liked Hillary way less. Or maybe Hillary's talking the way Obama has been for the past eight years and their lives haven't changed for sure they were and they were desperate to see anything else work. Be a little compassionate Wa on why a lot of people voted for Trump. Because remember this country voted a black president and a lot of those voters were white, uh, two times in a row. Well in order for him to have one, you have to have some people that voted for Obama last term that voted for Trump this to correct. There's a lot of people that thought it would be a better thing to have him other than her. Yeah. So there were not no racist and not, oh, you know homophobes they were. That's why I was always really careful about, I was always critical of Trump. I was very careful not to be critical of Trump voters because you know there are a lot of, but you're not being honest because are dummies in there too.

Speaker 1:          17:50          Just like there's dummies in the Hillary camp percent there on this. That's one of those stereotypes exist when you talk about the either the latte sipping Hillary supporters who literally know nothing about what the negative things she's done. If you say anything about, or you're a sexist, I mean there's a lot of that going on too. Those are real people. Like the real ridiculous people on the left and the right. They're all real, you know? So the, the hillbillies at loved Trump looped you'd I've seen it, man. I saw a video where this guy got pulled over with in an altercation with this guy hitting. This other guy had gotten some sort of a traffic altercation and this guy comes up to his window, he's calling them the n word and he's saying, Trump, man, I'm with Trump, Trump's president now. And it's that type of person of course that like there, there are people like that that want to let you know that this is their guy now because they're white and that this is like a racist thing.

Speaker 1:          18:37          You think that their races winning, you think there was KKK people that voted for Hillary? Like a special group? K K K for Hillary. How many KKK people are there? Like let's be honest, how many just straight up racists and how many KKK people? 2000 official Dick's. There are a lot of these $200 I'm sorry, 200,000 I thought I saw. Okay, that sounds, I wouldn't doubt if those a million in the south. I think there's definitely probably a million racists fish clan members joining an organization's on knowing like how many UFC fans are. There's a lot, but if you had a joint organization to be a UFC fan, they'd be far less of us. You mean by an a paper view hood and go to a fucking flame. You gotta go to a bonfire. 5,000 what more than 40 different clan groups exist? Many having multiple chapters or cleverness.

Speaker 1:          19:28          That's cute. Including a few that boast of presence in a large number of states. There are over a hundred different Klan chapters around the country with a combined strength and members and associates that may total around 5,000 Oh my God, they're a little bigger than 10th planet. It's a little bigger coupler that is so crazy. I don't even know if they're smart enough to be anything. I think that they are a lot of them. So people are just sort of guys who want to be part of a group and you know, they, they've been told something, they don't do any research and they're just dicks when they are. A lot of just shitheads want to be part of a hate group. A lot of the problem with black versus white as the same problem as left versus right. Black versus white left versus right. Share that fucking team thing, man. They share that team thing and white people want to think that they're on one team and black people want to think that they're on another team and we fuck each other up doing that. It's so stupid. Human, human, human beings are very tribal. I mean, anthropologist tell you that all the time that human beings are tribal. It's about time. Like this generation has cut that shit.

Speaker 2:          20:41          Okay.
