Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. See like if you're booing a basketball game, Huh? Maybe I got it. I guess like there's something that's so much more intense about a fight. Especially like there's smart booze. Like when someone does something illegal or someone does something she could stall week. Yeah. Or something. Someone does something that's fucked up. There's smart boots, but then there's booze where guys were just like facing each other and they're canceling each other out. Like you're watching a Billy high level thing when these guys are trying to solve what, what do I have to do to connect on this guy's fucking brainstem and knock his lights out. But we don't have to do is marketing toward these casual fans who are basketball fans and football fans who aren't really the people who are hardcore who appreciate the martial arts side of it. What these guys are putting into it.

Speaker 1:          00:47          You think so? I think that just marketing, I don't think they're marketing towards any specific fan. They're not marketing towards, people don't understand that. But I think that's the almost the same thing cause they're just trying to get a mass audience. And the majority of people aren't people who really, people say that though. What makes you say they're trying? Like what are they doing specifically? Um, I feel like when they put together, you know, fights, it don't necessarily make sense in terms of rankings. When they put the interim belts on, on fights where don't really need to be there. You just know it's a marketing move. Cause I think a, a title on a poster, we'll probably sell that many more tickets. Good point. It definitely juices it up when you have an interim title it like in marketing dude, it's going like, oh yeah, we saw this many more paper vision and as the title and I don't know the difference between the interim title or a regular title.

Speaker 1:          01:30          A lot of the casuals don't know the difference between Michael Bisping or fucking doors. Samp yeah, look, I'm with you set a bar. I almost feel conflicted because I have this part of me that's like a purist that's like, no, it should be just like whoever number one is versus the champion and we should never fuck around. That's how it was going for a long time. If they were just like, oh, you know what, we just set up Nick Diaz versus Conor Mcgregor. I'd be like, that's the greatest thing that's ever happened and I don't care. I don't care. I don't care if Khabib's one 72 fights in a row campus, I'm flying to fight a hundred out of 100 times. I don't give a fuck where he's fighting, who he's fighting. It's just fun and it's exciting, but let's get real. I think there was something really pure and it's beautiful, but MMA is that.

Speaker 1:          02:09          It's always going to kind of figure itself out. It is the greatest sport because it's the greatest sport. I didn't think it happened any given Sunday. It's inherently built. The marketing has sort of built in already, right? So you can, you can create a pecking order, you can create rankings and I think you can kind of just say, hey, the pieces are going to fall where they're going to fall and it's always going to be super exciting. And you see with the way they handle Connor or certain guys, they definitely, they threw that to the side. And I think Conor is a great example of it as well. Why they don't really care though. Like I fuck it dude. Go Do may whether they had it for a little while, was that part of the promotion? Yeah, they made millions of dollars off that thing. Everybody made a fuck load of money.

Speaker 1:          02:45          I mean, may whether made hundreds of millions. Connor made 100 million. I don't know what the UFC made. Everybody got fucking crazy paid and then they started zoo for boxing and now there are other offering, uh, uh, Joshua and Joshua, you're offering 500 million. I'm crazy contract. Apparently that might be bullshit. I don't haven't asked anybody if that's real, but I'm not surprised. They realize this is a lot of money and promoting fights, whether it's promoting MMA. Dana has a big background in boxing. You know, his son actually just had a, a, an amateur boxing fight. I saw that in his Instagram. Yeah, he loves boxing. Fuck. Dana loves boxing. So I always loved it. So it's not unusual that they decided to go into it. But with Connor it was like one of those things where you're like, yeah, that's what you're supposed to do. If may with a really wants to fight Connor and Connor has never had a professional fight and you make a hundred million bucks.

Speaker 1:          03:32          Let's see, let's see, let's see who buys it. But I'm just saying as an MMA purists were what's best for the sport of MMA, that's not necessarily the best move and not, oh it's not bad. Both. It doesn't hurt it at all because first of all, it shows you that in the specialties that there are people that have skills and techniques and abilities that just far exceed the very best MMA fighters. And you saw that with Conor and Floyd flood just fucked him up. He just fucked him up. But Connor caught them a little bit and he'd tell them, tag them in the beginning and you could say that Floyd wasn't going full tilt and he probably wasn't. I would say definitely wasn't. He was definitely trying to wear him out and get him tired cause he knew that he relied and kinetic energy for the first round or two, but he's still got clip with a shot.

Speaker 1:          04:11          He did want to get clipped with. Sure. I think Floyd wanted to see what Connor was doing and he spent the first few rounds like kind of taking in data and like seeing like, okay, what are you doing here? What Weird Shit are you trying? But still I was like, I did not think Connor was going to do that good. Very well. I thought it would be over within three or four rounds and may whether it would knock him out and he would just outclass him in the fact that it went 10 and then even landed some shots. I, I was pretty impressed with by itself. That's like, it's not bad for, as a purist I'm saying it's almost like it's the, the way they're sort of letting Connor run the show. Um, I just kind of feel like the UFC sort of always built this brand UFC.

Speaker 1:          04:50          It's, you know, it's a cocacola of MMA and I feel like Connor has basically become bigger or at the very least as big as the UFC. And he does, he did, he doesn't give a shit tweet. He tweeted out the other day, I'm the boss and he was promoting the video game like a, they did a pull them up with Dana white is the one of the characters. Um, but I just feel like that wasn't necessarily the best thing for mixed martial arts as a sport. I almost feel like what they were doing with isn't it hurt it at all? Yeah, maybe. Maybe. I think it's, I think it made it bigger. I mean it's like, dude, what Connor created was like a thing that's like, it's just really hard dude. Even when, when he fought up Marcus [inaudible] image as his first fight in the UFC, and I remember, I'll raise it, there was like an energy in the crowd about Conor fight and even know who this guy was.

Speaker 1:          05:35          And you're like, why is this like such a big thing? And then every fight was just a bigger and bigger and bigger thing. And then we create this thing where like Dustin portrays like biggest fight ever as against Conor McGregor and Dustin had had way more big fights than him, but still the big deal was that you're fighting this guy. Like he just, he would create these stages just that it was the results. Like you put markers. Yeah, he starts dust in the first round slept Josie Aldo in 13 seconds. It was all real accomplishments. No, it wasn't. Why him fighting Floyd Mayweather. It was interesting because he was so exceptional as a striker. But do you think that this, I, I give the UFC so much credit with building con Conor McGregor because he wouldn't have been able to do that anywhere else. Like the UFC is such a big brand that he couldn't have been a belt warfighter fighter and become, uh, you know, a worldwide name the way he is now. Probably not. If it's, which is weird, it bell towards a stupid name. They need to accept that good for him. They need to accept the money.
