Speaker 1:          00:00          Go active drug. So there's a lot still to be discovered. Now Canada has just recently legalized marijuana as of today. Yes. Yeah. Um, did they have any plans or do you know of considering the legality of other substances? As a matter of fact, they do. Um, uh, there is there, I can't really talk about it that actually I, I shouldn't talk about it cause I don't have that much information. But there is a gentleman who came to one of my retreats. I meet the most interesting people at these retreats. You wouldn't believe it. This guy is, uh, uh, of aspiring young politician, Canadian politician from Ottawa. He's talking to Justin about legalizing psychedelics for therapeutic uses and he's, you know, working with some, some lawyers and so on and putting together a proposal to do this MTMA assisted psychotherapy trials to begin final phase in Vancouver.

Speaker 1:          01:03          Well, letter you go. But that's maps, right? That's the catalyst behind that. He wants to change policy. And the thing is the Canadians are reasonable people. That's the big difference from America. It was, you know, you can propose this kind of thing and they'll, they won't dismiss it out of hand, lol, you know, what's your evidence? Why should we do this? So Justin's a very young guy. I mean, he's young, 40. I imagine he's been beyond the chrysanthemum a timer to I do. Really? Sure. I think so. Wow. What makes you say that? Because he's spoken about it. Hi. I'm sure he wouldn't speak about, I guess just to guess he's the right age. Um, he, well, I can't say it's just pure speculation. LE, let's put it this way. I, I wouldn't be surprised for people who don't know what we're talking about. Beyond the Cassandra means there's this thing that you see when you break through, when you do DMT, that's very bizarre geometric pattern that resembles a chrysanthemum.

Speaker 1:          02:04          Right, right. You know, the, the Canadians, I mean, for instance, to get approval for these Mtma trolls was a lot more straight forward in Canada, you know, and, uh, now, and, and they've done some clinical studies with Iowasca and they're, they're on board with that. Uh, they've done some, some studies with the indigenous people in Canada. They call it first nations, but they have, they have done that and it's been pretty, uh, it's been straight forward to get that work done. That would be really the drug hysteria that we have, you know? So I think it's a good place to produce, pursue this research. Well, in many ways.
