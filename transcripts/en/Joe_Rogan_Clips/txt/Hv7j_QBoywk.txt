Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience.

Speaker 2:          00:03          Here's the problem with stopping hate speech is like who's to decide because they're pushing the boundary. Would hate speech so far in that, right? Like if you call a trans woman, a man that's hate speech like that, there's,

Speaker 1:          00:16          it's Kinda what did, that's just an accident. Yeah, it's still accidental hate speech. Why? That's crazy. Because we live in a new world now. See, I can't accept that you don't go online and now if you do it out of malice, like if you're, if someone's like, Hey, I'm Margaret, and the guy goes, no, no, I'm not going to call you that good there, then that's them being proactively prejudice. Right? I'm being a dick. They're being an asshole.

Speaker 2:          00:40          But some people are of the opinion that this is all nonsense. But if it's an unknown, but I'm not sure I'm not taking, taking their point. But I do want to play devil's advocate because I've had conversations with people who are pretty intelligent people than to say, this is all nonsense. And then this trans stuff, and this is, this is a trendy thing that people were really getting into. In summary Bore really distorted. Like their perceptions of reality is really distorted and they're being talked into this because it's a thing that a lot of people are doing it. And so they're getting, and um, I hear that and I go, wow, I don't know if I believe that people are willing to transition to another sex because they're confused. That's a big leap. It's a giant ass leap. But here's the other leap. The leap is you telling someone whether or not they feel a certain way. And then the other leap, here's the other leap. What do you give a fuck if Bruce Jenner wants to become Caitlyn Jenner? Okay, I'll call

Speaker 1:          01:30          or Katelyn to, I don't care. But if she thinks I'm gonna stop making fun of her, she's out of her fucking okay. That's what it, but that's what I mean. So you should be allowed to just, you should be allowed to mock at a freedom that you would anyway, every six foot, three person would size 14 high heels gets mocked, just listen around the clock. It, anybody would get made fun of for any of that in any other way. Yes. If you used to be a girl or you used to be a dude and now you're a girl, someone's gonna make fun of you. And that's just the price you pay for being a person. But people make fun of everyone for everything. Everything. You have red hair, right? Is My whole life, your whole life. But what? I can't start a group against it being like people trying enough of this enough.

Speaker 1:          02:06          No, just it is what it is. Everyone has these slots. The kick of Ginger Ginger Day. That wasn't cool. No, but no, but you know what's so funny about that? Those guys were so subversive. What they're doing is showing how quickly people jump onto things and go, yeah, fuck them. It's true. Come on. So they're so smart. I love that episode because it was like that could be a real, and that's how dumb people are. People in the real world have told me, been like through it. I wonder where we kick of Ginger Day is they buy. That's real to them. But that's, that's by the way I played, I played golf with a buddy at the country club that, uh, Caitlyn Jenner belongs to. My first question does, does she hit from the women's season, the men's tees? And the guy with me goes, she hits from the women's taste.

Speaker 1:          02:47          I'm like, Bull Shit. See, that's bullshit. Is it bullshit dude? Because you, you, you're a fucking Olympian. You, you were, you still at the difference between the men's tees? I mean, like distance 30, 40 yards. Yeah. Ah, yeah. That's like doing those pushups on your knees. Bullshit. Yeah. Good on your toes, but oh, but wait a minute. He used it. Uh, she, she had, she has man structured muscle and didn't go away. That's all gone. No muscle. There's no muscle. While she's still pretty fucking jet. Not Really, man. No, I'm going to be honest, I don't think she works out at all. And she's old already. So it's not like your body has, I still say you go back to the most taste, but she still has a Dick, right? Nope. She had the operation. Cut it off. It's hollow. Is it gone? Yes. No. Okay. Now you get women's tees it up.

Speaker 1:          03:33          Dick was there. You gotta go. You gotta go back to the black. Yeah. This is a lot of fence riders out there in the Trans World. You got to pick it. You got to pick dude. You gotta come, you gotta come or go. That's another thing. They're saying this, and this I don't agree with this, is they're saying that if you are a person who is male and likes women, if you are unwilling to date a trans woman, it's because you are a transphobic bigot, including if that trans woman still has a penis. That is, that's of no regard. You know what the, you know, the funny thing of the, of all this is I'm so happy to just be a CIS gender men, like a fucking, I'm so happy to not have to worry about it. I don't have to worry about it. No one's gonna call me a bigot for not liking a subsect of a kind of a thing that I like.

Speaker 1:          04:16          I just like a wall. I like women. That's all I know. I like, that's it. I'm fine now. They'll come around to you soon. Take [inaudible]. They got Bruno Mars. He didn't see it coming home on that. What did they say after? Brutal. I'm writing black culture. Cultural appropriation. You see how many people came to his rescue though? A bunch of people were like, that's bullshit. He's a musician. He cores. What has he done? Was He appropriating black culture? Zinging awesome. Made good music. Yeah, that's all he did. That billionaire songs, a wonderful song and he made some fucking great songs. Great artists. It's bullshit to think that people now can stab at anything that you're like, now you're just trying to cause a stir. They try it. They take swings at sometimes don't work. Like remember they were trying to block Bossy, stop saying yeah, that's right.

Speaker 1:          04:52          Yeah, but like fuck off. Like okay. Can just put it out. I just want to put it out there and try to put it out. It just giving it a shot. Yeah. Bruno Mars, they shut this down so fast and he didn't say anything back. Good for him. That's my favorite shit. Yeah. It's Kinda like, you know how like Samsung and all these other phone companies, they make ads about I iPhones, you know, other, all their ads are based on, fuck I phones and apple never makes a response. Of course, that's the coolest movies to be like, whatever, man.

Speaker 3:          05:28          Okay.
