Speaker 2:          00:05          Yeah, I was in Costa Rica and uh, we were down at this g this water, it was the biggest waterfall I've ever seen. It was like hundreds of feet high and it landed in this lagoon, this round lagoon. And the water, they told you don't go near the water. And so there's these Japanese girls sitting on the edge. They got their feet in and then one of them like jumps in and the water fucking sucks her down immediately. And I dove owl, I have, I have a lifeguarding to Greg from when I was stoned and 16. And so I dove into the water and I grabbed her and luckily I was checking them out because they were these beautiful Japanese. So I had my eyes on them. And uh, so I dive in and I grabbed, I grabbed her and I pulled it to the surface. I do the cross arm carry and I've pulled out, I pull her out.

She probably thought you were a lifeguard. Yeah. Probably thought that's what happened. Yeah. And then I, and then I left and I'm with my family and uh, they didn't see it happen, so I was so fucking bummed. Then we get to the parking lot and uh, there's this busload of kids from some school and they had seen the whole thing and they started chanting hero to me. Oh, what do you fucking see what's happening right now?
