Speaker 1:          00:00          So with sterling it's like sterling called out Covington. Yeah. Garb. Rant. Yeah. Yeah. I'm saying Colby Covington already cause I'm already thinking that mother Gamelin that marketing. Yeah. Well he's good at talking shit and getting his name out there and it's the best thing for the welterweight division right now. After it loose man just dominated Tyron Woodley. I was blown away by that fight me to loan away. I were texting each other. It's weird cause I had people around the house to watch the fights and they were like, God, this fight so boring. And I look online like God, this is brutal. I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about? I was one of the greatest title fight performances I've ever seen her forever to do that to Woodley and dismantle him. You don't understand. You have no idea what you're watching. It's fucking insane. It's not just insane that he dismantled them, which is for sure insane.

Speaker 1:          00:50          But also his fucking gas tank Uzman was pushing on the pedal for five fucking rounds. Never let off the gas. How about the way he looked in between rounds when Dan and to me it was his mentality. When you look from the f, the first round she was, they break it up and then you're ready standing there like this. I'm like, oh, he was, do you know that word was that he had a fractured foot? Correct. So he took a fucking cortisone shot coming into that fight. Imagine that savage. Imagine that and still no problems with his endurance. Apparently didn't train the whole week of just didn't do shit. Still made the weight. No problem. But think about what he has to do. His coach is gone. You got to go in there. You got to out grapple. How maneuvered Tyrone Woodley, who's one of the best welterweights of all time?

Speaker 1:          01:34          Well he, how does he get taken down? Did empties and get taken dad who doesn't get taken down? He also was kind of, I dunno, he's 37 I don't know if it's, he just didn't show up what happened. But he's 36 [inaudible] 36 either way. Same thing. Either way he's been doing for a hot second. This is why I feel bad for thing. Maybe you know Joe, but Woodley was always that guy where he didn't get along with Dana. He was kind of difficult to deal with, did it his way and made some demands, want the big fight and then it never happened for him. Right. He just, he was in a big draw and but he could get away with that when he was champ right now that he's not champ the road frame to get back cause going to be so fucking tough. Right.

Speaker 1:          02:14          Because of what he did when he was champ. That's why I feel bad for Woodley and he's one of the greatest to ever do it. He is one of the greatest to ever do it and I was making the argument before this fight that he, you could argue, you could argue that if he beats Guzman spawn, he is the greatest. Correct. He's in the, the the greatest is George Saint Pierre, right. He was a legend at welterweight. You, you look at his career, I mean how many years was George to champ for? Was it six years or something crazy that the most title. So you have George, Matt Hughes and Woodley Matthews has legend status because he was the original, right? He was, I mean he was the first wrestler that really developed rock solid submission skills. The, the fights with frank Trigg, the f I mean he, when he, um, armbar George Saint Pierre and their first fight, I mean he was amazing.

Speaker 1:          02:59          But then the new school was George, you know, George was the best welterweight of all time, but I was saying that d he's in the running right now. If you consider the opponents he beat Wonderboy twice, knocks out Robbie Lawler, the wind, the title, and then goes on from there. Beats Damien Maia. Um, I mean you, you look at how he beat Darren till for some reason he was an underdog and, and Darren till five, which didn't make any sense to me. I thought everybody got excited. I got excited too. I thought Dan is going to win. That really? I did see, I thought Darren tills very good, but I did not do much. I never saw him on the ground. I never saw a real wrestler take him down and ground and pound. I didn't know what he had off his bass. He, I think there until it can be a prompt for Huseman what really is size. Yeah. I think we see a problem and Dan has committed to one seven. He still is. He still, I think especially now that one 70 cause what is, if you are a fan of fighting, what is fun is Woodley be an out the welterweight division. So fun.
