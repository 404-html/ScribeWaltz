Speaker 1:          00:00          However, 1911, the last of the Yani Indians issue was discovered in Oroville. I can't believe I remember all this in Oroville, California, northern California. And there was a bounty on Indians back then. You could shoot a man Indian and get 25 bucks. You should 1911. Yup. They had bounties on them. Instead of shooting this, Yani does last Indian, they called the local sheriff and Nate took issue into custody and they called, uh, some scientists and uh, uh, Pelon theologists I'm from California University by the name of, uh, Saxton Pope. And Saxton pope came and studied each. She as a, as a aboriginal last pope, a pope and young. That's right. And then he contacted his buddy art young, who also studied in that genre and they discovered EEG and they were fascinated by his stealthy awareness of the wilderness in his archery control with his funny little style of shooting the bull with his thumb and getting close and doing, uh, ice cold river bathing before the hunt to cleanse himself to be worthy of the beast.

Speaker 1:          01:20          So Fred bear witnessed the film that Pope and young eventually made of them becoming consumed with the mystical flight of the Arrow. Now this was in the twenties and thirties, and they put a newsreel out when all over the country and showed this newsreel of hunting with the bone Arrow by Saxton Pope and art young shooting grizzly bears in Yosemite and going to Africa fill in lines full of arrows because they weren't really as good as he, she. So they'd fling a lot arrows and these animals pretty relaxed, almost tame because they'd never been hunted like that before. And so Fred bear come from Pennsylvania around that time, um, to work at the Fomo company, a building cabinets for the new radio they just invented and the wood dashboards for the Ford Motor Company. And he was also making bows a handmade. You would an or Osage orange bows in his little archery shop with Nels grumbly.

Speaker 1:          02:12          I can't believe I remembered Nell's grumbling, one of the greatest boy years of all time. So my dad got the archery bug because Fred defied the trend of easier hunting, easier, long range. You didn't have to be very stealthy shooted here at 500 yards. They don't even know you're there. I have to do is be a discipline Marchmen which is a discipline and a great accomplishment unto itself. And it was a new challenge for long range ballistic capability. Will Pope and young and a handful Fred bear, Nell's grumbly went and saw this newsreel of these guys, these doctors, these, uh, professors hunting all of the world with these handmade bows and fed was already into it and he was, how be damn this, I didn't realize you could do that. And so now people after seeing the pope and young newsreel started asking Fred to make bows and it spits spreads.

Speaker 1:          03:09          So we started the bear archery company, late twenties, early thirties. And he moved to Graylin up in the northern part of Michigan with a wilderness was, and they had cut down all the trees. So there was this new growth of ideal wildlife habitat because not many animals can live in an old growth forest and our tool. But you need low level escape sanctuary in browse that the animals can access. And so Fred was now promoting our tree in Michigan, one, all the, uh, uh, national field archery championship championships along with an Marston. It's awesome. And so my dad was a follower because he'd come back from World War II and he needed that escape. He needed that cleansing to get away from that horror, which is why they never talked about it. And so we go up north every year, October 1st, the Nugen family and the Ford station wagon. And I have my little bone Arrow with the suction cups.

Speaker 1:          04:03          And I shoot stuffed animals off the couch. But my dad would walk the woods with his real bow and we'd stop at this little, uh, brick shack that said, bear archery. And I had no idea. And so I was already into bows and arrows shooting all the time. I was obsessed. I was an downriver every day. No baseball, no football, no hockey, bows and arrows, bows, murals, critters. I think I had the songbird world's slam by the time I was eight. And, uh, and so now I'm meeting this tall, lanky gentleman named Fred Bear. And it didn't register with me until I started seeing him on the cover of true magazine and sporting magazines and, and life magazine with a Grizzly bear and an elephant and a tiger and a lion in the newsreels. And I'm going, I'm shooting river rats, which is so thrilling. I can't even describe it.

Speaker 1:          04:47          And here's this long, lanky, tall, lanky guy that was building bows in this Russ rustic shop in northern Michigan on my way to my favorite thing in life, October 1st opening day of archery season as a six, seven, eight year old boy. And we'd have chocolate milk and Cherry Pie with this Fred bear guy. Now it's registering. This is the Chuck Berry of [inaudible]. This is it. This is the guy. So I became a namerd with him and he was kind to me and he'd show me stuff, but I got to hang out with them as I grew. By the time I was 16 we moved to Chicago, was my dad got transferred, but I got to visit with Fred bear at least every other October. Never hunted with them. And I am now. I started Amboy. Dukes. I had already had a great band when the battle of the bands and Michigan with the Lord's, we opened up for the Supremes and the Beau Brummels at Cobo Hall.

Speaker 1:          05:33          Wow. And so now I'm in Chicago shooting my bow and Arrow all the time. Started the Amboy dukes playing like a madman, graduated in 67 went back to Michigan that two years later and immediately went up to grading. We're now, there's this huge cathedral bear archery had Fred bear is like that dude is like the sporting dude because he taught the long range marksman that there's an intimacy, there's a a better learning process in more important lesson to not kill the animal but to understand your relationship with the animal and to try to use those God given gifts. I mentioned a moment ago to penetrate the otherwise impenetrable defense system of game cause they are sneaky, elusive, crafty. God made them to get away from guitar players with sharp sticks. And so this caught on because people go, you know, I killed my deer every year with my 30 30 now with the 30 out six and Roy breath, whether it be long range, I wonder if I'm a bad ass enough to get close to a deer with a bow and arrow.

Speaker 1:          06:41          So it caught on like wildfire and they made the first, Fred got the first legal season in Michigan, the Alagan state park on November 1st, 1947 where George Nichols, my buddy got the first legal buck in Michigan with the bone Arrow on that morning. And so I knew these are the guys who hang with, these are the founders. These were the you were, I was at the Concord bridge of our tree. And so Fred had embraced me and it was real suspicious of the long haired hippy looking, you know, rocking Maniac Motor City Madman. But all of his friends would not, no, he's not into drugs. He's in fact he's anti and he's always promoting our trash out my bone arrow on stage forever. Now it should. Flaming Arrows at skulls and a big illegal, I think it was a felony, a big Turkey vulture. I had stopped, but it looked great. Backlit, you know, and I'd shoot that fucker off this amps at night. People didn't know whether to shit or go blind

Speaker 2:          07:34          is is wild man screen the bird lands. We make it all this outrageous racket. I come up with a bow and Arrow and a flaming Arrow and blow up a Turkey vulture. What more do you want? And so Fred got

Speaker 1:          07:48          pass the insanity of the fear factor of rock and roll. And he finally admitted to me, he said, every sporting good show I go to Ted, all the young people, anybody under 30 all they want to know is if I know Ted Nugent, because that was the first time they ever saw bone arrow. And they read my you my interviews about the, the spirit, the cleansing of escaping the insanity of whatever your job description might be. Mine beaten, maniacal rock and roll. I need to shut the fuck up, take a deep breath, get my bone arrow, letting my guitars breed head back to the woods.

Speaker 1:          08:33          And live and and remember who I am and what I'm here for and I never killed a deer. I was a little too uppity and we didn't know what we were doing back then. You have too uppity, you think? What do you mean? I just, I'm high energy. So you had to, I do. I write about too loud. I mean, I could walk. I learned from, I learned walk toe first and I learned to go around anything you instead of stepping over and to stay in the shadows. So I knew of the maneuvers, but coming out of a tour and played 350 nights a year and then you get a couple of days off during November and you get the bone arrow. It's hard to go from that to total silence. Yes. But you know what Joe, what? I've mastered it. Well, I know. Yeah. I finally, I mean I did buy it and you might have six long time by the 60s I don't know about masters.

Speaker 1:          09:26          You'll never master it, but I have mastered transition. What do you say when people like that? One of the arguments about hunting that people bring up is why would you use in a bow and Arrow bow and arrows not as effective. If you wanted to kill something, you should use a gun. There's people that don't hunt that think that hunting should only be one thing and it should only be killing the animal from me. Whereas I think that someone who hunts definitely kills the animal from me. There's more, there's more to the whole thing and do you ever seen me expound on that fun sport meet trophy. You can't hunt without having fun or you won't do it. It's fun to challenge yourself. It's fun to get up into those aren't able to have a problem with that word. They can kiss my ass if it wasn't fun.

Speaker 1:          10:09          None of us would do it. I understand your, your your take on it, they can kiss, kiss your ass, but you, it means something to you. It's not as simple as like, fuck you, this is just how I'm going to do deep fun is being the greatest basketball three point shooter. Isn't it fun? It must be discipline. He went. But it's, it's always fun. It's because it's invigorating and the bow hunting is more invigorating because it's so difficult. So disorder lining, possible fun sport. Why don't think sport hunting is good? You shouldn't have sport. How can you hot without sport? Well, don't you think that there's just too many of these words are poisoned. There's like trophy hunting by eight at term. Can't hunt without a trophy. You know what I have on my wall to my northern cabin. You're going to, you already are inclined to love me, but now really going to say you're going for you to, but fuck me right here on the whoa.

Speaker 1:          11:00          That's not love. Well it's a metaphorically speaking. That is for some of my buddies. Anyhow, so I'm the wall of my cabin in northern Michigan is my first kill. November 15th, 1969 with my dad's pre 67 bottles. Stuck button. Buck. Do you hear the story? Yeah. And I took it to the taxidermist and I said, I want this mind when he said here to mount this, you'll, yeah, no buck button. Button. Buck is a font of the year with the, has little buttons on his forehead, which is illegal deer with a doe tag. And I had that year and I said, it's a buck feel. You have to feel on the head, make sure it is a buck is it's such a little guy and it's illegal dear. And it's a delicious deer there. Deer, the years of fun. That's why we have this hunting season in the fall because now they're independent.

Speaker 1:          11:42          They're not there have been weaned. They're, they're independent animals. In fact, the, the button bucks are, they're acids get kicked by their mother to throw him out of the herd, get the hell out of the way for more breeding, which is what I do. And uh, and so I have that button buck mounted. Well, who's going to tell me that's not a trophy? Tha Tha Tha Tha experiences the memories, the clothes, the bullets, the day, the sunrise, the crows, the sandhill cranes, the birds, the movement, the anticipation. And I got backstraps, I had fun, ultimate discipline, challenge, sport, ultimate meet, ultimate protein, the purest, most organic before it was even hip. And if you, I dare you to tell me that button. Buck is not a trophy. I got, I have wood chucks mounted. I got a shot. I would chuck in the eye with my grandson. I have, I have squirrels. Mud. He's always a trophy. Mounted a squirrel. I sure I'm, I'm the squirrels czar. Um, you know, when you, when you first started out, you killed that first squirrel. That's exciting stuff.
