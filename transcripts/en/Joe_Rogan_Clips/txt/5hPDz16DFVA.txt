Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah, well everybody feels like it's somebody else's job. Everybody feels like work like, yeah. And everybody feels like, well, you just got to get out of that neighborhood. No, that's what I was supposed to work. Roxanne Shawntay talked about reentry vacation. She said, you know, she, she doesn't want to hear people keep complaining about gentrification when the kids that are leaving these neighborhoods, whether they'd sing dance, rap or not, or just Cokie good jobs and Colby decent human beings. You should be reentering your neighborhoods. Who should be buying houses or pieces of land near one of the most impressive things, one of my favorite players of John Stockton, and I'll know if it's true or not, but I read a story that he actually bought a house right on the street he grew up in. So an Aussie that he'd go back essentially home with his kids.

Speaker 1:          00:42          So they'd had some type of normalization to their life. We, we should be doing that. You know, um, Tiana, I have bought properties together in the same neighborhoods we grew up in, were developing things like restaurants and stuff. I like to see more athletes or rappers become the merchant in business class, net weight and I like to see people who grew up in neighborhoods move back to those neighborhoods they grew up in like like the typical iconic American dream. You know, you can build a, you know, another 8,000 square feet in the back of the a frame house if you want to, but you shouldn't be going to 50 60 minutes outside the city and they complaining about the blight of the city because you took yourself away, you took the talent and the resources away. Do you think that everyone should feel that way though?

Speaker 1:          01:28          Or is it, I mean, do you feel like you have to be committed to the city that you grew up in or couldn't you want to just get the fuck out of there and go somewhere different? It's nothing wrong with getting the fuck out, but you just think you should go back and support it. Yeah, it's like I tell kids, you know, in college and they say, Mike, you know, what can we do? You know, kids and college kids, when you go speak at a college and say, well what could we do? Kids want to affect the world. Very easy. Find a kid in high school, tutor that kit and make sure to replace you with this university or another. I said, you're just please replanting a scene. If you grow food, you know, you don't grow the same land you have to year after year.

Speaker 1:          01:58          Some you have to give that land a break, retail it, you know what I'm saying? And it was kind of like the neighborhood. So you don't have to stay in the same neighborhood your whole life. You don't have to feel like I never win anything or escaped anywhere. But you do have to, don't sell your mother's house, you know, rent it to your cousin, you know, let your younger assistant but don't, don't sell your mother. That piece of land was worked for the blood to toil the soil. It means something and it should. And, and for working class people especially, it keeps your neighborhood and communities more like the ones that made you be a good human being. You know? So I think that there is something, most people don't leave the town he grew up in and moved to the other side or they moved to the suburbs for most people or most people marry somebody they knew.

Speaker 1:          02:39          You know what I'm saying? My thing is make the best of it. Don't let it keep becoming a worse. A man named Mr John, my wife and I own barbershops or people don't know. We own these things called the shea washing room shops. We have one at state farm arena that when the Atlanta Hawks play, we have our flagship store on Edgewood Avenue. Edgewood avenue was once an Auburn Avenue when wants to centers of black Atlanta in terms of commerce and retail and money, Atlanta life insurance company with the, are you guys Google? Some of this stuff's is big time shit. You know, this isn't the old narrative of we've never had nothing because that's not the truth and it was a very rich city for African Americans. Still is on his street, used to be owned by African Americans. The storefronts in there, their children after these people. Dot. Off, sold the buildings off and sold it for cheap.

Speaker 1:          03:23          And I know this because many, Mr John who runs the grocery store, they are stopped me one day he said, you know, Michael, after we're gone and this neighborhood's been gentrified and everything's different, they're going to come along and say that white people stole this from us. And he said, that's not true. He say, the children or the people that were here left and they never came back because they didn't think what the parent's bill was good enough. Oh man, to kill me. Because that is snatches black people, less Americans, period. We have gotten to a point where we are unappreciative, we are entitled, and we don't think what happened before us was good enough. So we don't treasure it. We don't honor it. We don't reinvest in it. That could be a farm in Milledgeville, that could be a house in Adamsville, but we have to do a better job of appreciating ourselves, appreciating our community and income preciate now greater community and you have to reenter.

Speaker 1:          04:18          You have to reenter fi day. You have to be a part of whatever gentrification happens to make sure that your stake is still there and net what you care about from a morals and civil perspective is represented there. My uncle, my uncle John Blackman, who's a huge influence on me dad and had a five car garage where, where he did transmissions and stuff and I begged my aunt to sell it, please, I don't want you, I know they're going to come. The beltline is coming. I was, but please sell it to me. I didn't want my uncle's building, you know, for to go to strangers and become, you know, an apartment complex or something. And I walked in your building, not seen your building. And I said, wow, I know what I'm gonna do with it now. I've had it for like three years and now it's just, I just had it, but I didn't never knew what I wanted to do.

Speaker 1:          05:00          But you would like, Yo, you need somewhere to go every day you're building is impressive. I'm like, Yo, I'm just going to just make my bit, my uncle's building, my office is right. And I figured out a way to make a lot of money off of it. I mean, I've already made a lot of money, which was me and leaving me to buy it. But it's important to me that as his neighborhood turns into hipster land, cause it's definitely going to be, she's going to be black hips, going to be like chocolate hipster lands. I just wanted to make sure that's there still some chocolate working class in there and sometimes they're going to go buy coffee and there's going to be a loud ass muscle car and lots of marijuana smoke point out of it. So they'll know that, you know, my uncle's nephew still in town.
