Speaker 1:          00:00          So Dude, last time I was on, I was just about to go to Venezuela and um, that was insane. I went and vetted myself in the protests there. Holy Shit. Is the media line about that too? And then, um, they're, you know, vices on the ground acting like bad asses. They're embedding themselves in the protest and being like, look at these fucking awesome dudes. Um, it was basically fascist mobs tried to land just and we got chased out of the country and then our colleague got shot because we dared to tell that um, the death toll that we kept hearing in the mainstream media that Maduro is mowing down all these protesters, we found out that the majority of the deaths were actually caused by the protesters. Like either shooting people, lynching people alive, burning them alive, or doing these giant roadblock heads where they would light giant flaming piles of trash and people would be flying off the freeway or getting an accidents and shit.

Speaker 1:          00:49          And so once we just reported those facts, then this lynch mob came after us. It was very, very scary. And look, I mean, the media is lying about the popular support that that Maduro's government has. Um, there was massive pro-government rallies there and the country's pretty divided where it just depends on who you talk to. What is vice doing over there? I mean, vice is, is an imperial arm. You should, everyone should check out my brother's documentary called the barriers and imperial. Oh Dude. 100% of the u s government, Shane Smiths and imperial. I'm Smith. Welcome to Obama and Biden into their office. And they were like, BFF dude, the COO of vice was like Obama's like spokesperson. I mean, good friends with Shane. I know him. I know him very well. I mean, vice repeats. He's not an imperial guy. I'm saying they're lying. They're lying.

Speaker 1:          01:36          They're lying. The line not lying the line because they look, I think Obama and Biden are war criminals. So I don't think it's cool as a journalist to not challenge power. And so when you invite these people into your office and are really buddy buddy with them, I'm offended by that. You're such a radical lefty. I love it. It's trailing Obama and Biden, a war criminals, even though the lefties fucking lutely even the lefties, like what does it look so fucking they drone king bayed drone king. Yeah. There was definitely a lot of drone desks, but um, check out a very heavy agenda and my brother's documentary just goes over kind of a lot of stuff about vice. But I think the problem that I have with device is, is just like the problem that I have with all, all other corporate media, like we were saying, there's always align that's uniform that basically promotes the US empire and promotes American exceptionalism.

Speaker 2:          02:19          Clearly you've never, when you fucked, that's delicious. You know, what is that best show on vice longs world, Eddie Wong's world, those two? What's that? Action Bronson is fuck that. Salicious that's his show. You know, Action Bronson has the rapper. Oh yeah. Yeah. I haven't watched it. Never had a human being come in the studio and smoke more weed. Never seen anybody smoke nonstop. We had an ashtray that we took photos of it afterwards. Like this is how much weed action Bronson smoked while he was on a show. I just ran into him the other day at the UFC. He smoked like how many joints? 10 joints, easily. Big Ass joints, big fat boys just puffed him down to the NUB. And we were, we were with Jamie and I were stunned. We were like, how's he keep going?

Speaker 1:          03:04          That's my advice to vice does have a lot of good shit. Got a lot of the problem is that when it comes to coverage, a foreign palsy, I think they really missed the boat. I then they're good on lag. That's the thing. It's the, it's still accept. Um, you know, it's like anyone can kind of submit. It's a kind of like Huffington Post. It's like a huge tent.

Speaker 2:          03:20          I think they have a hard time filtering everything out. I think they've gotten, you know, they were this radical sort of like upstart where people hadn't heard them before and they were doing wild shit and they had some really cool videos, like, like the guide to travel. And they did that thing where they went to Liberia and met with general butt naked and he's explaining about eating children and cutting their heart's fucking insane. So that was all Shane machine did a lot of that stuff and that was the early days.

Speaker 1:          03:47          But that that's I, I appreciate that, that kind of style of journalism, but I feel like what's missing is the context behind it. Like just vice, we'll go to like India and be like, fuck, this is fucking nuts. And you're like, well, why is there this massive disparity? And you know, it qualities. So it's a different style of journalism. But I do think that they really missed the boat on Venezuela, Russia and Ukraine and some other things when it comes to covering global conflicts, because that's just the problem with a lot of journalism and corporate media in general, is that you're toeing the line because you're an American. Just like we were talking about Israelis. I mean, you have preconceived notions. You have your own bias, you have your own ethnocentric lens about world issues. So it bleeds over into those conflicts. And unless you're like an internationalist, can you see the world from a different Lens? But when I was on the ground in Venezuela, I was like, this is not what we're seeing.
