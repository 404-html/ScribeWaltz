Speaker 1:          00:00          If they can do that and get people really upset if they really can't do it. That's a really effective strategy. It's a great strategy. Can make things happen now cause it's just sewing internal discord and we're going to collapse her own system. Like I wonder how many of these Jesse Small a is that? I see his name. Jesse smell, A's rushing. The whole thing is Russian. It's not even real thing is Russian chess. It's Molly doesn't exist. I wonder how many of the memes were created by Russians to try to get people upset. I bet this bunch. I bet there's more people stirring things up then just Temaze Americans that are upset. No, I'm sure it's people that are, but then there's also just a lot of Americans that hate each other. Does that? Yeah. Yeah. There's that. But then you also, what do you think happens with Jesse? Small light his empire because ABC got rid of Roseanne for tweet. You got to get rid of this guy. I thought he was getting canceled. He was getting written out rather than I read today. But yeah, I dunno. I thought he was getting written out before and this is one of the reasons why he did it. Well, I support him if that's the case, cause he's a very hard business.

Speaker 1:          01:00          This is a very tough business. It is hard. It's hard to make it. I love that they had to plan that out and he said to the two guys, he goes, listen, get a noose. Yeah, cool. Get rope and doing those. All. A lot of these hate crimes, if, first of all, I hate crimes happening. They're horrible. But some of these things are fic. Do you know he showed up at the hotel with the new still around his neck holding a subway sandwich. Just that alone, the people and people at the hotel should have been like, what? What happened? That's amazing. Okay, what happened? Why juice? It's still at the sandwich and why are you eating at subway or you're not sick to your stomach. You're on empire. What the Hell's wrong with you in the wrong subway? Subway's not good. It's not bad if you're hungry.

Speaker 1:          01:42          Listen, I've, I've clearly hating it. Yeah, but it ain't great. But if it's like two o'clock in the morning, it's the only thing open. Why is he telling me to, yeah, that's a great point is it's open. Okay. A good move to be open when nothing else is open. It's a good point. You get a nice Italian. So I would double meat. I like the [inaudible] oil and vinegar, salt, pepper ball with the Mozzarella, whatever. And then you don't toast it. You let the hot and meatballs melt the cheese. Ooh, I agree with that. Yeah, that's a good move. Meatball sub. It's always a good one. It's always a good morning. Especially after faking a hate crime. After you fake the hate crime. Amit, both. How nervous you after you do that? I'm such a pussy. I could never go. I could never do what. He did some level associates, but then I saw that act right.

Speaker 1:          02:24          You know, with the other night, and I went, oh, he could do that. Yeah. Oh, these people can do it because they're on another level. Well, the other thing is that people say, who would want to be a victim? Who'd want to fake being a victim? I heard that during the cabin off hearing. I was like, that is a ridiculous thing to say. Cause there's a lot of currency in our business, in our business. It takes a lot of conflict, tea in the world, like people like praise victims for showing out and they support them. You get a tremendous amount of love, especially if you're a legit victim. Something of course, you know, I mean there's a lot to that. Yeah. The idea that no one would do that is so there's so against, it's so contrary to human nature. No, everyone would do it. I want to do it.

Speaker 1:          03:05          What would you do? What kind of hate crime would you faked? It was great idea. I don't know if I got punched and people saw my face, they'd go good. It deserved it. You know what I mean? Like nobody would look at my face ago. Yeah. Okay, good. Well, I wrote, I tweeted something today. I was like, Hey, I'm at flappers on uh, what was it? Uh, my, the 26 of flappers I was, it was two guys was Hollywood would Maga hats. They beat me up. They put something on me. I don't know what it was. I think it was come please come to farmers. But I mean, that's the thing. Listen, I watched good morning America interview this morning. I left, I sent it to my buddy. I go, there's a moment in it. When they go, how'd you know it was the attackers? And he goes like this.

Speaker 1:          03:46          He goes, and you could see the insanity. You can see in his eyes. He goes like this. He goes, I was there and he's just doing that Shitty actory. Oh, like just fucking shitty acting class. That horse shit. I was there and I'm like, this is fucking crazy. Oh, he was going to inform on two guys if there were two white guys with Maga hats who got caught. Oh my God, I'd be in jail right now because the detective said to them, we have two suspects on camera. Do you think it's Sam? He was like, yeah. Then he found out it's just two buddies and he's like, well, I can't testify against them. He was going to testify against two people who they thought were guilty. So he said that he thought it was dumb. Yeah. He said, yeah, there's a good morning America interview.

Speaker 1:          04:28          Oh, have him going? Yeah. It's those two that takes it to another level and then Fox, he's like, well, we stat with, hey, he's good on the show. We stand behind them. That takes it to a completely different way than it would be people in jail right now. He wouldn't care. Could you imagine? It's crazy. Could you imagine not just faking a hate crime, but then putting people in jail? Magic being those two guys were just sitting in jail like, what the fuck? You're on the cover of the New York Post. Nab dumb got them, got them, and they're sitting there like, what the fuck? And everybody wants to kick their ass empire. Next season is all about Jesse smaller. They fire everyone else on the show and it's just a Jesse smallest story and two innocent people. The Gay Tupac wandering the streets of empire. That's why people in Ohio, whenever Hollywood like, here's how to vote.

Speaker 1:          05:14          They go, you know what? No. They go, you know what? No thank you. I see what you're doing. You fucks faking hate crimes. What kind of hate crime would you fake if you're going to do it? It's a great question. It's a great question. What if, what if someone gave you a license to fake a hate crime? Like what if there was a television show about faking a hate crime? That's how they do at punk. You know, you are fake things like that. How about you fake a hate crime? I'd love to do something like that. True TV presents. Yes. Fake a hate crime. Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting. I don't, I'm trying to think. Press conference a whole deal. Maybe a Halaal guy would attack them in New York City. Like a Halau guy would attack me. Um, because he views me as a symbol of imperialism and oppression.

Speaker 1:          05:53          There'll be good, you know, even though I patronize his stand all the time, still feels the need to attack. I mean, I don't know. I could never do that. No. I'm one of those people who would get, and I would get caught, well this would never think I'd get away with it. Wanting everyone to think you're a victim when nothing really happened is insanely selfish thing. Yeah, that's an insane like faking physical crime. Ikea to have someone punch him already hit himself. Yeah. These marketers, phase Maggot hat wearing gangs that everyone's talking about in Chicago and La and New York do not exist. If you have a mega hat on at 2:00 AM in New York, you're getting bleached poured on you. Yeah, probably reality will also like just, he was saying that he like punched him back and he fought back and I love how he was like, first of all he was on camera for everything except one minute.

Speaker 1:          06:39          So they ask him to good morning America. They go, how long was this? He's like, it felt like several minutes, but it could have been 30 seconds. Like he's covering the span of time in his, in his lie he's going, I got to say it's less than a minute cause I'm only off camera for a minute. Whenever you hear about a guy like kills his wife and blames a black guy, you know there's been a bunch of those, right? It's been a ton of, and then you see the Energy Simpson, for example. Did he blame somebody? Blame know somebody probably blamed him, you think? Nah, I'm kidding.
