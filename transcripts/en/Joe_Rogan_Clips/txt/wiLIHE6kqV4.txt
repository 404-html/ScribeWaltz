Speaker 1:          00:00          One of the problems with climate change is that human beings like to react to things that are immediate and right in front of them. And I think for us it's very difficult to see the future, especially if it's inconvenient as, especially if it does something to inconvenience or get in the way of our day to day routine. And that seems to be what happened, what's happening here. And that seems to me, excuse me, it seems to me to be why people are so willing to dismiss it. Uh, so flippantly because in front of them right now, it's not an issue in front of them right now. This very second is very day. I'm going to go to Starbucks. It's right there. It's open. Look, I'm outside. It's 65 degrees out. Global warming's not a problem. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:41          No, I think that's, I mean, totally true. And I feel it in my own life. Like I, I mean I've been living, I've been working in this material so long, I know it so deeply and yet when I look out the window I'm like, you know, things are fine. Yeah. And I think that has a really powerful anchoring effect. Like we expect the world of the future to look like the world as it does today. But all the science says that's totally naive and we're going to have at least twice as much warming as we've had to this point. And I think we need to think about the future of the world in those terms. Like what, it will be a two degrees or three degrees at four degrees. But it's not just like the immediacy. I think we have so many biases that may, like we want to be optimistic about the future.

Speaker 2:          01:19          We have a status quo bias. We don't want to change things. We think that will be complicated and expensive. We have a hard time holding big ideas in our head like that. The entire planet is like subject to these forces. Um, I mean the list goes on and on in the book I have a little riff where I say, you know, there's this new not so new now, 30, 40 year, um, discipline in economics, behavioral economics, which is about all of our cognitive biases. How we can't really see the world. Every single one makes it harder to see climate. There's this, um, he's actually an English professor named Timothy Morton who wrote, who wrote a book about, um, climate and he calls it a hyper object, which is like, it's a, it's a phenomenon that's so big that we can't actually hold it in our heads at once.

Speaker 2:          02:02          We can only see it. It's like if you imagine seeing a four dimensional object in three dimensional space, it's that kind of thing where you can only see it at an angle only partially climate changes. So all encompassing that we can't comprehend it properly. Um, but I think that's all, all of those things are reasons that we need to be listening to the scientists and what they're projecting. Not to say that everything they're saying is going to come true will come true. Exactly as they predict it. Obviously that's not how science works. It gets revised. Some things are alarmist and things are extreme, something's just wrong. But you know, I've been really working on this stuff for a couple of years and the number of papers I've read that show that make me have a more optimistic idea about the future of climate. I could count on two hands, the number of papers I've read that make me have a bleaker view of the future. It's in the thousands. And when you look at the totality of that, whether the six climate driven natural

Speaker 1:          03:00          disasters prediction is going to pan out exactly as those authors say, who knows? But when you see, you know, so many, so many terrifying studies that you could fill. Like I did a 300 page book with them. You realize that like there's a huge margin for error and it would like, we would still be really in bad shape. You know, is there a, I mean, I'm sure there have been some studies that made mistakes in terms of like past studies have projected that by now we'd all be dead. Um, are those, those seem to be a problem with this whole concept we have of wrapping our head around it and if we find anything that we could point to that say, oh way back in the 80s, they said we all be dead by now and we're fine, we're going to be fine. That kind of thing is that that is an issue. Correct?

Speaker 2:          03:46          Totally. Yeah. There was, um, there was a really famous book in the Middle Of the 20th century called the population bomb. So this is a guy named Paul Ehrlich Ehrlich, who he was like, you know, the world just cannot support this many people. Like if we get to 8 billion people, there just won't be enough food. There won't be, you know, the, the planet can sustain that. And he's often pointed to as this sort of like profit of dooms day that and his prophecy totally didn't work out because we had this thing that's called the green revolution. Basically we figured out ways to make crops way, way, way more productive and that's encouraging. Human civilization does that a lot. We figure our way out of Fox holes all the time. But that revolution was literally like one dude, Norman Borlaug who figured out how to grow crops differently and one guy, one set of innovations and he completely transformed the whole fate of the planet.

Speaker 2:          04:39          What did he do? He just basically did, um, like genetically modified crops before, like the, you know, before the name, it was like, um, he could golden rice guy. Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah. And um, and you know, the whole developing world benefited enormously and you're still seeing that today. Like we see all these charts that, you know, so much less poverty, so much less infant mortality and developing world and that's great. That's like incredible progress. But a lot of that has, was powered by the industrialization of those countries, so that bill is going to come do going forward. Um, and you know, I think like when you look at climate change, you know, if there was just one threat, like let's take agriculture since we're talking about agriculture estimates, say that, um, if we continue on the path we're on, by the end of the century, grain yields would be half as productive as they are today just by the temperature effect.

Speaker 2:          05:35          So we'd have just as much land, just as much grain crops as we have now, but the food we get from it, we'd only get half as much as we get today. What's the cross of that? It's just the temperature effects plus the temperature alone. Wow. I mean there are other impacts to on food. Um, like insects, there's hotter temperatures means more insects, which is bad for crops. Um, carbon has a complicated to to crop growth, like in some plants grow bread or better with more carbon, but actually they're like the weeds and the ones that we like to eat don't grow better with more carbon. Um, and you know, by the end of the century, so we could have half as much grain and we could have 50% more people than we have right now. Um, now there's a way you could imagine, oh, well maybe there'll be another Norman Borlaug, maybe he'll figure out a way through that.

Speaker 2:          06:19          But when you look across the spectrum, it's like agriculture. It's, you know, conflict for every half degree of warming, you need to get between 10 and 20% more war. So if we get to the end of the century, we're going to have more than twice as much wars. We have to, and this is projected because of battles over resources, mainly that famines, droughts, um, whether, you know, weather impacts, basically everything about unstable societies get stressed by temperature eyes. The Syrian civil war was, you know, it wasn't single leak caused by climate change, but it was, that's one of the causes. There was a drought and that produced it. And that conflict, it's not just at the level of nation states or even civil war, it's also at the level of individual. So if you look at crime statistics, when temperatures go up, there's more murder, there's more rape. People get admitted to mental hospitals more when there's, when it's warmer out.

Speaker 2:          07:07          Um, babies develop less well in the womb when it's hotter out. If there's for every day over 90 degrees that have babies in the womb, you can see those days in that baby's lifetime earnings and we're living, we're going to be living on a planet that's considerably warmer, that's going to have real dramatic effects on everything. Um, air pollution, there's a big study that I write about in the book that's totally alarming and eye opening, just between 1.5 degrees and two degrees of warming just through the effects of air pollution would cause at one half degree of warming would cause an additional hundred 53 million deaths, which is 25 holocausts. That's just air pollution, just between 1.5 and two degrees. And two degrees for me is our best case scenario. So our best case scenario is 25 holocausts worth of death from air pollution. And that sounds terrifying.

Speaker 2:          08:00          People when I say that to them, they're like, Holy Shit, how could we possibly that's unconscionable. But already 9 million people are dying every year from air pollution and we don't pay attention to it. So I think the likeliest outcome, even as we enter into this like climate health scape, is that we find ways to turn away and not look at like the real pain of people, especially in the developing world. But to answer your earlier question, you know, like you can imagine agriculture getting figured out, but when you see just how many impacts there are, it's like it's everywhere. Everything will be changed. And it just makes the challenge that much bigger and more complicated because how he, you know, how are you going to solve the conflict problem? How are you going to solve the problem of having 30% less economic growth? You know, like I said, that's an impact that's twice as big as the great depression and it would be permanent, um, $600 trillion in, in climate damage as twice as much wealth as exist in the world today. Um, and that's just, you know, then you deal with it, right? Refugees, food. I mean it's, it's, it's so all encompassing. And I think, um, that's another reason why we don't want to look at it closely because

Speaker 1:          09:09          terrifying. Well there, there's also a matter of how it's being projected to the public, right? Like in, in certain circles, particularly right wing circles. Uh, there, there are people that are trying to paint this with rose colored glasses, right? They're trying to maximize short term profits and sort of dismiss the risks of climate change and dismiss the risks of, or rather the impact of our, uh, what we've done in terms of raising the carbon in the atmosphere. There's some people that point to that like this, this is nonsense science. This has been disproven. There's a few people like that, but it's an overwhelming, the overwhelming consensus of scientists who study this are terrified of it.

Speaker 2:          09:52          Yeah. I would say there was some recent report that said now past the standard of physics that like climate science is now more reliable than physics. Um, bus hilarious. But you know, the, um, to the, to the deniers, you say things like, you know, the planet was hotter than this before. That's true. Yeah. Dinosaurs lived here. Humans, we're not here. I mean, if we're four degrees warmer for the last time, the plan was four degrees warmer, there were palm trees in the Arctic. Um, what's, yeah, really, we've already exited the entire window of temperature that enclose all of human history. So the planet is now warmer than it ever has been when humans were around to walk on it. Which means to me, it's an open question whether humans would have ever evolved in the first place. And this is all from the industrial revolution from then on.

Speaker 2:          10:42          Yeah. And uh, yeah, and like, and to that question, it's like there are people who say there's some natural warming going on. I don't think that's true. I think most scientists would say it isn't. But I also think if what we're seeing is natural warming, that should terrify us even more because it would mean that it's outside of our control. And if we're really heading down the path that we're heading down and we have no control over it, that's even more scary. It should be a comfort that we're doing it because it means we can stop doing it right.
