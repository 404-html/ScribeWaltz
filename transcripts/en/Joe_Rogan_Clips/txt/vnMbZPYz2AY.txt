Speaker 1:          00:00          Scientific Research. I definitely believe that you ever see trinity and be chatting around, Oh, you know, let's, let's start slow because you didn't go over so many different things in bombs trying to ignite the atmosphere and the 1960s. Oh No, I know that the US air force tried to destroy the atmosphere in 1968. Yes. Uh, operations, starfish prime. They actually did get a nuclear bomb. They adopted to detonate a nuclear bomb in the upper. I'm trying to blow up the rental and renovation. They've done a lot of goofy shit. See that's the thing. That's why I got mad at you and I love you. You're a smart guy and everything is on. You can go, listen, you got mad at me cause we didn't communicate all this stuff. I know you're even better at saying it and then you sit there because you can't handle it and you shake it.

Speaker 1:          00:41          I can. I go now. It's not that I can't handle it. It's, there's two factors. One, I don't have any time. I don't have enough time to go into it as much as you do. You asked why I flipped out and got mad at you. That's it right there. You, every time I bring up a fucking subject, you know all about it. I don't know all about this fucking know all about six shit, little shit. You're a smart guy, Joe. Joe, just as a Po Bullshit. You know exactly what you're, I don't think you're a bad guy. You're trying to survive for you and your family and do good, okay? But your family, none of us are going to make it. There's a post human error coming. The breakaway civilization, the deal's been made. It's not, it's not the third dementia. They've made fricking deals with interdimensional aliens.

Speaker 1:          01:24          Okay, and notice the media never industry for that cause that's the truth. Maybe this is true. I do not know this and we'll get into it. Okay? I do not know this and even these human pig hybrids, Jamie just pulled this up. I believe it's true. I mean, I'm sorry. The Sandy Hook kids die. My identity is not that I get it. They admit five g and all the studies La Times causes massive mutation and cancer. Wait a minute. Wait, minute really rattles your DNA apart. All of our kids are under attack. You mean five manager for allowing five g to come in? This is the new Internet. You know why they won't let China put in Wapo you know, swap or major. That's the big Chinese are on fire today. No. Let me tell you. Gee, you're on fire. No, Joe, Joe, the five g you're on fire.

Speaker 1:          02:07          Okay. Okay. Maybe see article and 96 about human animal hybrids with pigs and cows. Yes. You've got to make you part cal. So cal keeps you. Does it reject it or part pick. Okay. Okay. But let me expand and, and you know about pigs and rats were most closely related to us. Not even chimpanzees. That's why a lot of the organs don't get rejected. You know about that? Yes. Okay. Yes. Pigs are very close to humans. Even use pig organs and piece will usually know everything show. No, it's true. I mean, you know, in a general knowledge, you know everything I know. No, no, no. I don't listen to it. Let me tell you, this is literally, we know what they're doing. She'll just like, they say just like they say, Oh yeah, we had human animal hybrids. This is like fricking 39 years ago now, 23 years ago.

Speaker 1:          02:51          I'm reading in the BBC about it and go confirm attack. Okay, and they're just floating in. There was an article in 1999 in the Baltimore Sun and I interviewed Nick because she read a Dick McCutcheon and Dominic mega. She'd know Gotti blow you away. Who is he? His Dad was a US congressman, got killed. His brother, US senator, he, he like, he should have him on the show. They're the guys that got all the money given to native Americans and spell his last name. Baggage shits. It's, it's, it's, he's good friend of mine. Can I get them on apps? A fricking lift flyer right now. Anyways, the point is, so what does he do? He was telling me all these years ago, he goes, Alex, it isn't chemicals in the food and water. That's child's last name again. Beg It checked. It's not going to worry about it. Jimmy. It's electro chemical. Okay, it's electro chemical, but I'm reading and the Baltimore Sun Aftra just had him on and thought it was crazy.

Speaker 1:          03:35          He's giving all these patents for mind control using wavelengths in microwaves and I'm sitting there looking at it and I'm reading it and I'm, and I'm seeing it and the Baltimore senses the CIA is testing on cell towers, uh, wave links to calm the public during crises. I just had baggage, Sean with patents talking about that. What baggage explains his, it's not that the microwave. I have somehow interfaced with the brain. We already interfaced with the space winds and all these other magnetic fields and everything else show. They're all just testing this stuff and so everything they deployed, they've got all these other technologies. My Dad was at ut and 65 when he was in high school. They already had CD roms, computers, everything. But they had a nuclear reactor underneath the building and what supposed to tell them? Oh absolutely. That's what I'm telling you.

Speaker 1:          04:21          It's a breakaway civilization dude. We don't know what they got. We don't know. We don't know who they are. We don't know. The whole thing. That's what I'm telling you is this is hiding in plain view and that's why it's so crazy. Imagine if you knew all this. You're trying to tell people and they go, Oh God, he's doing that. Find one thing he did it sounds mean and make that his whole world. So that's what I'm telling you is it's been in the newspaper that the cell towers are being used for mind control. That sounds like a schizophrenia. So see, here's a, here's where it gets tougher. I want to see that. How do they use this salad? Tongs whole. I'd probably look, here's the thing. Skits. Listen, here's the deal right here. You've got a total schizophrenia that thinks the sun is following him around town and thinks their dog is watching them and works for the aliens.

Speaker 1:          04:59          That's not happening. You've got someone over here, someone over here that believes everything they see on Fox News. Yes. Okay. Yes. Now questionings. Good science is good. Trying to figure out what's real and all of us get freaked out in the nature of the world. No one knows what the university is. We don't have all the answers. So it kind of, people can't handle that bigness. They can't handle that question. I'll especially low Iq. So they have to differentiate and create a model that allows them to put it in boxes so they can make it make sense because they can't handle it. It's like, uh, like I say, even top astronauts space walk for the first time and they're out in the universe and the whole planet's under him. And what are they gonna do? They it, it's mindblowing. Well, imagine once you realize we don't know everything we don't understand and it's endless and there's all this crazy crap, people go nuts and it's humans learn more and more.

Speaker 1:          05:49          As we become more advanced and go to this metamorphosis, it's going to create a giant societal crisis where most of the people already going to get killed. The globalist understand that in the birth of this planet, this new species. And so they decided to take control, make it scientific, stun everyone in Denim Noun so they can scientifically try to orderly carry this operation out. But then I go, wait a minute, you're detonate. And over a hundred dollars in bonds, the upper atmosphere to see if you could ignite the atmosphere destroying the earth. Yeah, but that was in the 60s I know, but what I'm telling you is the same professors train people, but those people are dead. The people that detonated those hydrogen bombs in the 60s they're dead now. Does not. We're not dealing with the same human beings. I'm with you. I know people in a lot of ways or more immoral now I think I agree with you in some ways that everything evolves and things get better.

Speaker 1:          06:35          This is one of my arguments about operation Northwoods that if they were able to push operation Northwoods and get it signed by the Joint Chiefs of staff in 1962 was it 62 if they were able to do that and no one went to jail and no one got arrested for proposing that they were going to arm Cuban friendlies and have them bomb Guantanamo Bay and blow up a Cuban jetliner and, and, and, and shoot people in movie theaters. Yes. And schools. Yes. That things evolve. Things evolve. And if unchecked, and obviously that was unchecked, no one went to jail for that. No one got, you know, even PBS covered it. Like I never even knew this. Let's read this one here. The significance of the research he explained is that although the cell phone power is low, electromagnetic radiation can nevertheless have an effect on mental behavior when transmitting at the proper frequency.

Speaker 1:          07:23          What does this article Jamie Scientific, American and scientific American at the title mind control by cell phone. So really does have an effect. They did a whole study. Let's go further. So there is, so what do you think that they're making this classified last year, a 37 page, she IAA manual from the 1970s where they were putting up shell towers that look like trees already testing at neighborhoods. Okay, the judge, can I shut the phone, tracks you and watches you and controls you and surveil shoe. You think that that, that it's one way, but beyond that it's a microwave relay relay system they can manipulate and then the towers are even more powerful. So this is a device given to us by the gotch. Okay. Given to us by the technology that that the breakaway government, NASA has developed that you don't just think they made up themselves. Right. What do you mean? Who Do you think made it up? Well, when you're ready to get to it, I want listeners to understand something.
