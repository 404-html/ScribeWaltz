Speaker 1:          00:00          Turned around and go, wow, I really don't know what I'm talking about. A lot of times I really better think about what I say more. And even now I'm just a lot more careful about making absolute statements. I don't make any more absolute statements or things like that because you want to be sure that you're conveying the right information to people.

Speaker 2:          00:14          What were you saying before the podcast started? You were, we're going to bring it up again about veganism coming from a religion. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19          Yeah. Veganism started, um, with the seventh Adventist church I believe. So there was, um, uh, you know, a group of people that had a church and the guy that led the church as part of the church was like, you know, they were following the Jewish kosher laws or whatever at first and it was like no pigs or whatever else, a shellfish I think. Yeah, no pigs or shellfish. And then the guy just said like, it just sort of took it to the next level and said, and like, no, no meat, no animal products at all. And so these people that were in this church were like the first real group of vegans. The Church of seventh Adventist I think is what it was called is where it came from. Like 1863 is when that movement I guess started it. I'm like sure I'd started early.

Speaker 1:          01:02          I'm sure people were doing it earlier than not obviously, but I think that that's where the, the roots came in. I just find that really interesting because it does, you know, it does seem like a religion. It seems like. Um, today it seems like a lot of times you get, um, I get called out a lot on, on Instagram and stuff like that from people that are Vegan saying like, I can't believe you'd do this and blah blah, but I would never go on their page and say anything to them at all. Well, so there

Speaker 2:          01:26          proselytizing, I mean that's, that's a big part of this whole community is it's, there's a moral high ground. They stand on it. And then a lot of these people, especially people with Vegan in their name and their screen name, they always go after people and they try to shame people and what they're doing is in oh in many ways is a very good thing. They're not participating in factory farming, right. They're not participating in the horrors that we see in these fucking peta videos where you see cows and pigs and chickens are just being tortured, all that fuck, that is disgusting and that should be eliminated and it shouldn't be a part of modern culture. But in terms of like the humane raising and killing of animals, look, they're not going to live forever and I don't care what you say. I'm not into animal suffering.

Speaker 2:          02:10          I don't think they should suffer. But if you try to say the people are not herbivores or that people are herbivores rather, and then we're not omnivores, you're crazy. It's just not true. It's not fact. And they show picture. These are not the teeth of a carnivore. These are the teeth that were were not carnivores. Stupid. We're omnivores. Check stands and everything. Yeah, we, we look real similar and our teeth to fucking chimps. Chimps are omnivores and the human diet is a very complex thing. When you attach that human diet to ideology, then it gets really screwy because you're not dealing, you're not dealing with people that are being honest about dietary, like what is really important and as far a dietary requirements, how your body functions, what the studies show. If you look at it objectively, the objective, the first thing anybody should say first thing of cross the board, Garrett, all the fucking sugar.

Speaker 2:          03:00          That's number one. Yeah. Get rid of all the refined carbohydrates. Eat more vegetables. I think you guys don't eat more vegetables. Eat healthy fats. Get some formal omega fatty acids. Recognize that the omega fatty fatty acids you get from flax seed oil or not as bioavailable is fact from studies not as bioavailable. Is it? Mega fatty acids you get from fish and meat, you're just not the meat. The protein you see well broadly has 15 groups. It's not as bioavailable. You fucks and you know it's not, it's just not. So you can get bioavailable protein from plants. You get it from him, you get it from keenwah. You get it from peas, pea proteins where it good, but it's not as good as the, the protein that you get from meat. It's just not, can it sustain you? Yes it can. Can you be a healthy person and live a fucking bounced life on a completely vegetarian diet?

Speaker 2:          03:52          100% but I would always recommend eat free range eggs. You're not hurting a chicken. Nothing gets hurt. It is free food. We have, I have chickens. They roam around, they eat vegetables. Nobody eats them. The chickens live a fucking healthy life. They lay eggs, we eat the eggs. The eggs are healthiest. Fuck ethos. Find a place that has free range chickens. Eat the eggs. It's, I mean it's not Vegan, but it is vegetarian. If you want to get rid of dairy and you don't want, I get it, man. I've seen Gary dairy farms. It's fucked up. You see what they're doing at cows and they, you know, the way they, they treat them and the way they're raised them and just the whole idea behind it, like making them lactate. The only time cows lactate is when they have a baby, right? So they keep them in this state and it's just, it's unnatural.

Speaker 2:          04:36          And that is a reality of dairy production. And if you don't want to be a part of that, that's 100% knowable. But we have to be honest about nutrition requirements, not about the ideology of veganism. And this is the problem with these people. And so many of them, especially the ones with Vegan attached to their identity, because they use the name like I'm Vegan Warrior, this is Vegan prints and the Vegan defender, they're fucking morons who joined a gang. And what they do is they start eating plants, they start talking shit and they go looking to just go after anybody who's not on the same page as them. And the real problem is people that watch a movie, like what? The health or something and then think, well that this is, oh my God, I'm killing myself by not being a Vegan. Nope, you need to Google what the health debunked and find out the actual science.

Speaker 2:          05:25          Cause what they're talking about is bullshit. They're not being honest. What they've done is make a Vegan proselytizing movie. They're trying to get people to join in because that's what they do and a lot of these people, they give up a lot of these people that get to a point where the health can't take it anymore and they fucking give up. Chris Kresser is a perfect example. I don't know if you've, have you interviewed him for the film? Not yet, but we will. He's fucking brilliant. And he was a macro, but he was a macrobiotic Vegan. I mean this guy was all off the charts with veganism and eventually realize his body was falling apart and gave up on it. There's some people that own that restaurant in California and Hollywood. What is it called? The something cafe. Thank you. Can I think gratitude? Yeah. These people were, they mean they're fucking health was falling apart, so they decided to raise their own cattle and eat throwing.

Speaker 2:          06:10          Me and vegans found out they got death threats and people were fucking going after them. Yes ma'am. It was a terrifying thing for these people. They're all our folks. And they, they, they have their own farm and they were raising their own farm animals and they decided to start eating them. And when they made these posts about starting in, these people went after them. And you know, it's not, this is not kindness. And you know, this is not someone who is compassionate. He's a fucking cunts that are in a gang and that they're in the plant gang. You know, and if you talk, and I'm sure you've seen it by doing this carnivore diet thing, if you do anything that's outside of that, they go after you.
