Speaker 1:          00:00          Now, how do you guys start out? Do you start out like is there a like a open mic night or something? If a guy wants to become a rapper, how do you get going? Like I'm from the underground rap scene in that I like these cults rap. I like battle rap, that type stuff coming up. So I was more out of the open mic scene. Um, I got to hang around the older guys and the cool guys and the drug dealers because I can rap about street stuff. Right? Whereas you take like a, ah, he was always interested, love music and stuff. But tip was a trap rapper from the start. You know, he, he was entertaining for the streets so he didn't, he didn't need to go to fucking open mic. He just needed to be opened up on the mic and then allowed the greater public, the hearing, I'm said, excuse me, I talk about him and I'm in big boy because there are two of my best friends.

Speaker 1:          00:39          So I know I got poetic license to talk about those guys where I don't really, you know, tread lightly with other rappers. You never know. Feelings get hurt, but so there's no need for him to do open mics as much as just find someone who believed in him. And that was um, KP La Reid, Dj toomp and gave him platform to create the genre. Now known as trap music. Me, I came up more of how to, to battle rap scene and out of thing, you know, go show your wares. Kind of like a comic. You get up in front of everybody, do your shit, see what works, go home, readjust, come back next week. So when you do like a battle rap thing, we sign up. How would that work those days? You just threw you in the pit. I mean it was the first time. Yeah. You show up.

Speaker 1:          01:13          Um, I got my name, my name, my nickname Scott. Right. My nickname was skunk or my family called me Michael. Um, my friends were the unruly scholars and those guys were like just east coast rap. One was from Connecticut and one's from South Carolina was family is from New York. They could wrap their ass off. They were like Rakim and big daddy came in and sang group. They defeated a lot of guys may better records. And then one day there was this thing called green lights where people will play their music and then they'd be battled each other. My homeys income and man, you could just everybody who you thought was the homies, homies was just shitting on them. And I'm like, what the fuck? Like this is my homies and my manager, Rod, GG Mcgee, who I had just seen like a couple of weeks ago, he was the person that kind of pulled me out of knocking around in a trap, trying to be a petty drug dealer into a studio.

Speaker 1:          01:59          And he was the first person to say, Yo, this kid could really wrap. Like, you know, fuck that shit. I know he steals cars and you know what I mean? And he rides around, do a hood rat shit with his ratchet friends, but he can really wrap, let's get them in. So he was the guy that started bringing me in. So it offended me. They were talking about my friend like that. So I just start fucking off with their heads paddle wrapping them and a man, they double Dee called me, killed her that night. He said his kids are killer. Mike's a killer. And that's how I got the name killer Mike. Ah, what a great story. So the battle rap scene, you would just get tossed into a pit and how much time would you get? This is in the nineties this isn't like formal battle rap now.

Speaker 1:          02:38          Like battle rap has evolved like boxing now. Like what I'm talking about is essentially cockfighting. So, but like when you would battle up there would be no, no time limit. You time you just went, you just went until you won the crowd or the other guy shut the fuck up and walked away with his head down. What was a long battle? Rap Man died that night. Those guys were still, I literally took out four and five and six and those guys were still trying to come at me before d who was fucking built like you when? When? When we were children. You know what it was like as I was dede knock you the fuck out. Just told everybody shut the fuck up this kid one. So, and it was decided. All right, these spoken, you know what I'm saying? Dj Double d gave me, my mom gave me my rabbinate.

Speaker 1:          03:18          It gets heated man. I've watched a bunch of them online with dudes getting each other's face man. My um, my um, my, my Dj, Dj tracks star keeps me up with the battle scene and I couldn't do it like as an older man, I'm just saying to myself like, Yo, I just the how to fought somebody like straight the fuck up like by day day man, it's, the disrespect is amazing but amazing. It's a martial art of sorts. You know, it's a mental martial art. The ability to stay self disciplined enough not to wile out the ability to give it and take it. You know what I'm saying is, I mean it's an art. If you've ever seen roast battle, no roast battles with, they're doing standup comics, but the same principle. They go, well, they prepare for it like sometimes like weeks out and they tell them who they're going to be battling against and they write a bunch of jokes about each other and just shit all over each other. Ruthless joke writing. It's on comedy central and Rickles worthy shit, ruthless shit. This ruthless. That's what comedy should be.
