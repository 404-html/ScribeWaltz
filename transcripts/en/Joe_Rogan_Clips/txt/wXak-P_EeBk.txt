Speaker 1:          00:00          Based on what some, based on what we voted on, like if people really knew the information involved in like the safety of marijuana. It does it freak you out, you? Of course it does. Does it make you paranoid? Yeah, 100% but does alcohol make you an asshole? Fuck yes it does. Oh yeah, but do I think that everybody should have all of it? CBS reject Superbowl that based on the benefits of medical marijuana? Well, in their defense there's probably a bunch of people or stockholders and there's a lot of decisions that are made that are made by lawyers. I just want it just before people get angry about something that CBS decided to do. You have to understand is CBS is responsible for the employment of untold thousands of human beings. They're going to have bud light ads right next to this. They will or whatever and they will.

Speaker 1:          00:46          They will, but bud [inaudible], Bud light ads are not going to affect anyone's bottom line. I don't agree. I don't agree, but I just want people to understand that part of the problem is that the business aspect of this has not been fully established. Once it's fully established, CBS and all these people are going to realize it isn't any different than bud light. It's not any different than anything. You can get fucked up on bud light if you just drink 20 of them, you can't fucked up. You can walk into trees. We do it on, you know, cough medicine or what else? Anything. I mean, how many pharmaceutical drugs can you get fucked up on? And do we deny that some people who have like serious injuries benefit greatly from pain pills? No, they definitely do. The thing about it all, all is you gotta be honest and let people form their own opinions. And part of being honest about it, about these things is tell them the pros and the cons. Everything has a pro and a con, including a whole people banging it out and nursing homes. Exactly. Getting Committee, uh, you know, it's not good. The, the, the pro and the con is my dad's a pro banging old ladies in nursing homes, but the con is he's probably got some stuff on his little wiener down there. He's probably passing to biological footballs, but he's not getting pregnant.
