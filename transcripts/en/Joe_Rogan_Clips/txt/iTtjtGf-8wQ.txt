Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah. Which brings me to the one thing that I wanted to get to before we leave. This is a waterboarding. Yeah. And this is, this is something that came up because you were defending, what does her Gail, Gina, Gina, what does her name has bell hospital. And she is the person that was being appointed by to lead the CIA. Yup. And there was a bunch of people that were saying that she shouldn't be because she advocated torture and you uh, to defend her, decided to um, get water

Speaker 2:          00:29          boarded. Yup. We've actually been talking about this for the past hour and a half. Yeah. We have, we've been talking about, um, the slow erosion of, of the human condition. US getting softer and US getting weaker and US getting, um, norphine the edges and finding the easy outs and the easy solution. Um, the conversation of middle ground, finding a way that we can communicate with people and have a discussion. Um, we, so we've been, we've been having this discussion for the past 90 minutes and um, what I have is a bunch of people that are sane what something is, but they don't know what that is. Man. I know what torture is. I've seen it in Africa, I've seen it in South America, I've seen it in the Middle East. I've seen it on almost, I'm pushing 20 trips overseas in a military capacity, a handful of combat deployments, you know, from looking for poachers, human traffic, gears, drug cartel, um, kind of piracy, the things that I have done.

Speaker 2:          01:32          Like you want to talk about knowing intimately what torture is. I fucking know what torture is. Pouring water on somebodies face is not torture Kate. If you starve them, if you beat them, if you isolate them, if they're there for, you know, you're the only getting the yes, we can start adding things onto it. But the, the thing that was the most irritating was everybody's just throwing out this, well, let's talk about morality. And this woman is immoral to be in this position. I remember people jumping to their deaths on nine 11 because they didn't look at burnt alive, right? And then I saw a guy on his knees and have his throat slit open by somebody's pulling his hair back and sliding that knife across his throat. That was one of the guys that she interrogated. Not, I'm not saying two wrongs make a right, but she interrogated them to get a question, to get questions out of them, to try to save more Americans.

Speaker 2:          02:24          The intent was to try to save more lives. They say, okay, well if it's not that bad, then why did it work? And this is why. And this is what nobody understands. And it's because they can't understand the difference between the easy way and the hard way is that because these people that we were waterboarding are cowards. They were pussies. They're impotent little bullies their whole entire lives. If I put you on that water board, I could waterboard you for days. You have your moral convictions and you would never change cause you believe in what's right and wrong and that's a great and beautiful thing. They're not you. They are pieces of shit that that throw acid on little girls that flood planes into buildings because it's capitalist that that's who these people are. And if they're only tough when they're surrounded by 60 70 other of their friends, but you take one of them away from that and you put them in a, in a position where they're powerless and that's what waterboarding is.

Speaker 2:          03:21          The powerless and they cave and they cower in seconds. Like I don't need to drive a nail through their hands. I don't need to pull their teeth out. I don't take a drill bit and drive it through their fingernails. That's torture. This is us pouring water on a cowards face and they freak out and people can't understand that because they can't understand what these people are and their animals, the, the, these, these aren't beautiful religious people that are trying to do the best thing for the families. These people were the worst of archive. These were the Nazis of the 1940s but this is the current version of it in the these radical fanatics that are doing anything for any reason to hurt anybody so they can feel better about themselves and you take them out of that power, they take them out of that control. You take them out of that opportunity where they can be the bully and they're just shadows of themselves and then they give you everything that you need and what you need is an opportunity to save more lives. Well, there's two,

Speaker 1:          04:22          two things that were discussed about this. One, that your situation that you were in was not in any way similar to the situation that they were in because you were doing it with your friends. You knew you were going to be okay. You willingly did this. The the, the whole process was very controlled. You, you weren't being held by people, spoke a different language and a a country that hates you. It's, it's a situation where you knew you were safe, so you could relax yourself and calm down and tolerate it to the point where you knew that you, you would be okay. Yep. And what was the other side? The other side is if torture works, isn't that the best form of torture you're going to be? Okay. I mean, if, if torture does work and I don't know of torture works, I've never been tortured. I've never been around torture. And I know there's a debate both in both torture doesn't work. It doesn't work. Doesn't work. So that's not torture. No. So you think you feel like that works, but torture doesn't.

Speaker 2:          05:22          So I think, I think maybe we're arguing about vernacular and verbs or you're forcing someone to do something they don't want to do and you're, you're freaking them out. Yeah. You're doing something physical to them. So I think we just have to define torture. If, if, if it's me doing something to somebody that makes them uncomfortable is torture. I mean, me asking a pointed question at somebody's in an interrogation room down to LAPD could be torture. Right. You know? Um, if you smack him in the face as it become torture, is that torture? Right? Um, well, I don't know if I hit him with a

Speaker 1:          05:58          phone book. Maybe the problem is the word. Maybe the problem is defining the word you're, I mean, they, then they called it enhanced irrigation techniques when, if you're trying to get information out of someone that would save American lives, it seems to me, I may be ignorant, but waterboarding seems to me to be one of the most humane ways to do it. I agree with that. You're not going to do any permanent damage to the person. It's not like what they did a John Mccain when he was a prisoner in Vietnam, and that disturbed the shit out of me when that guy was on Fox News and he called them songbird McCain because he was, he was saying that, you know, terrorism, that torture rather worked on Mccain. Like how could you stoop like that? I mean, how could you do that? I mean, you, you know what that guy's been through to humiliate him and humiliate yourself by, by, by taking that position on television, like that was so disappointing. It's

Speaker 2:          06:50          about usable information. We're, we're, we're questioning and if you cross that threshold of torture where you are doing damage, physical damage, where they'll tell you anything that's not usable information that you're going to say that you've, you've been, you know, dating your producer for seven years and secretly like, I could get you to ace, say anything under the right conditions that doesn't do it. You just want to stop the pain. Yeah. Just anything to make it stop. Um, that's not what was happening here. And, and when we start talking about morality, if they're saying, okay, if this is a moral act, then then, okay, this make me and all of my friends that have done all sorts of tea, some in some cases, terrible things. Are we now a moral people because we did it in the interest of protecting our country and serving our country and, and providing protection for our freedoms.

Speaker 2:          07:38          And, um, I know those are cliche phrases that people grab onto and I don't want to, but it then by extension, throwing and lobbying those accusations at her extend to, uh, to me and to the things that I've done. And I think I'm a very moral person and I try to be a good person and in every way I can imagine, I'm not perfect, I'm not. But I try and the politics of bleeding over and misusing words, manipulating everything just so it fits your agenda, but nobody's in the middle of ground. Nobody's agreeing and nobody has the best interest at heart. And that's the people like the best interest should always be serving the people and none of them are doing that. They only care about what is going to get them reelected or what's going to give them more power, which can even more money from the lobby or what's going to give them more clout for the next vote.

Speaker 2:          08:33          What's going to give a little handout from the president or what's, you know, whatever games that play that happened on the beltway. That's what the, and that was an example of that in, in the most horrible of ways because it came down to human lives. It came down to somebody who had been serving their country since the 80s and the best way that she knew how in the ways that we're legal for her to do it and everybody else just manipulating the narrative to fit their agenda. When I'm just sitting here being like, how about the people and how about freedom? Who's fighting for us? Is it, are you guys just going to keep bickering about this? So me strap strapping myself to that board. Um, I'll tell you, it's harder. Do what's easy is to lay they're strapped and have somebody put water on your face.

Speaker 2:          09:16          Do it's hard. When I did to Steven Crowder, watch his hands where he'd reach up and pull the, he couldn't have, he couldn't take it. He would pull the rag off his face. See many times I pulled the rag off my face, not once, right? Every single time I said, no, no. Poor longer. No, no. Use the host. Use the bucket. Right now you're at a two. I need you at an eight now I need CIA interrogation friends, right? And I'm sitting there willingly with my hands. What the sensation of me drowning as that water's running into my sinuses showing that was intentional. I understand. People are like, oh no, he was safe. He wasn't even tied down. I did that to demonstrate how a man of resolve can do it effortlessly and how it's not torture because I could willingly lay there with my hands free to pull the rag off at any juncture.

Speaker 2:          10:06          But I did it. I just sat there and I asked for more. I understand that, but I also understand the position that people take where they say, you knew you were safe, and so this is why you had that sort of resolve. You are. You're not in enemy soil, being interrogated by Isis, being strapped down by them where you didn't know what was next. If you do think this, what would be next? Let's say Rachel Maddow from MSNBC, because we agree on so much. If she's like, Hey, I want you to come onto my show. I'm going to bring in five CIA interrogators and we're going to do it live. You're in control of nothing. Do you think the result would be any different? For me? Not the same, because you're on a television show and you're still, you're, you're Americans are going to do this to you.

Speaker 2:          10:48          You haven't been captured. You're not an enemy soil. You're not, you know, how far did on, how far do we have to go? You have to kind of be the person who's really captured is really captured. It's not a game. It's like if you get choked out in the street, you can't tap out, right? If you get into a physical fight to the death of someone and they take your back, you can't tap out. Right. And in this situation, you know, you can tap out. You know that even if it's CIA interrogating you and they're yelling at you, there's a part of your brain that knows I'm on Rachel Maddow show. They don't kill soldiers on Rachel Maddow show. This is true. Um, so I don't know how I could have better have illustrated. I think you did a fantastic job. I think the problem lies and it's impossible to really recreate it without you being an actual prisoner of war. Um, do what we do a reverse the roles we're talking about snatching these guys from their bomb making facility in whisking them to upgrade and, and pouring water on their face. What happens to me and my friends when were captured? Oh, we waterboarded no, no, no, no I'm not, I'm not saying that what they do to us makes what we do to them. Right. But I'm saying is, um, it's better.

Speaker 1:          12:03          I'm saying it, it's better. I mean since what I was saying before, if it is shorter, if you want to use the word torture, like we'd use the word drugs, right? Drugs are coffee and it's also heroin, right? They're all drugs. Caffeine is a drug, right. Torture. If you're just going to say torture, I'll take that torture every day because he knows what that is. Yeah. Cause even if it sucks, yeah, I'm going to be burnt alive. I'm going to be steadily right. Carefully, methodically, painfully murdered. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          12:31          And that's my only option there. There is never any other option. If I got captured,

Speaker 1:          12:38          there's no moral equivalency. I think we could both agree there's no, I mean, between us and them, there's not, but here's the thing. Mccain himself said that she shouldn't be appointed because she willingly participated in torture. He said that. Yeah. The, what did you think about that? I have one. Respect his opinion. I, the things that he has done,

Speaker 2:          12:58          whether we agree on things are, is irrelevant. His, his resume speaks for a spell. I agree. And I think very few people could speak to torture better than him. I agree with that as well. Um, so him coming from that position and saying that she isn't eligible to serve, um, is a very powerful statement. Um, I also feel that I'm pretty intimately familiar with torture and that I understand the full spectrum of, of what somebody can do selflessly for their country and um, selfless selfishly for their own satisfaction as a psychopath. Um, like Zarqawi's enforcer that would go around and kill people in front of their own family members had carried around a pat battery power drill. And I saw that we tracked him. So

Speaker 2:          13:50          I also know that when she was doing all of these things for her whole entire career, one, they were, you have to look at the context of the time and what was happening. Um, and when she did every single one of those things, they were authorized techniques. They were encouraged, they were successful in some degrees, um, to some degree. And so she was trying to do the best that she could in the, with the, in some cases limitation that she had. Um, and I think that is a trait that I want in somebody leaving the CIA that is that they're going to do the best that they can with what they have and what they're allowed to do. And

Speaker 3:          14:34          Aye,

Speaker 1:          14:35          I like that. Yeah. Muscle bulldog. I realize that, but this isn't someone who's talking about this in the, you know, the comfort of a board room. This is someone who's dealing with it in, in time of war and you're dealing with some of the most horrible people that we've ever experienced it or making these videos of cutting journalists heads off and sending them to their families. Yeah. I mean this is, this is, this is really what we were experiencing when people were deciding to use these enhanced derogation techniques. This is what they were up against. This isn't something that you can discuss in a classroom and, and get a full sense of the tone and what was happening in these people's lives.

Speaker 2:          15:14          Nine 11 was the tip of the iceberg when that happened there, there were hundreds of other plans to do similar things with Dev. That one was just successful. They had been trying others and they have tried other sense, whether it's a shoe bomb, whether it's a Paris train, whether it's a San Bernardino bombing, whether it's a, a, uh, uh, a garbage truck and France, you know, or London Bridge. It's any, any, they, they have consistently been trying to do that and duplicate and replicate that. The reason that it hasn't happened again to that scale to that level is because of the uncompromising selflessness of Kiros trying to protect Americans. Now, I don't want to go into what is the greater good [inaudible] are we losing morality coming? That's a rabbit hole that we could talk about forever. But man, I just want to preserve life. Why do you think that concept is so hard for people to grasp? Because that's scary.

Speaker 1:          16:14          Well not just that, but the concept that the reason why this hasn't happened more often is because of these people doing the heart hard

Speaker 2:          16:23          work. Why is that so hard for people to understand that increase your skin hard work? I just made a gut MTV show just so they could see for the first time that people work hard so they can have food and they have work hearts. They get of oil and they power that people. They look at a post when I don't have a shirt on everybody says man tinted, loving being off. You sorta. I've looked the same since I was 19 years old. I have looked exactly like this with the same eight pack with the same muscle definition since I was an 18 year old kid. I don't even know how many times I've been tested from the military for Usada two different events. I've been cleaned my whole entire career but nobody can in their mind they can't understand. To get from here to there is hard work. No, there has to be an easier way and it has to be steroids or it has to be this or it has to be that. It's the same way. They're protected and they're safe, but they can't grasp the idea of the hard work that it took to keep them there.
