Mike Baker, dude, did you hear that? I was humbled. I watched Mike Bakers and then I went down a rabbit hole on youtube, on MLK conspiracy here from the CIA's convinced that someone helped James Earl Ray to convince guys legit as fuck. So when he, when he said, all right, let me look in. Dot. Here's the thing, although I like Mike Baker, a great guy. When I brought up JFK did the CIA killed JFK.
