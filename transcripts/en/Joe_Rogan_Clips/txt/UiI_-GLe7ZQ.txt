Speaker 1:          00:00          One of the biggest mind blowing moments I think of my limited comprehension of what it means to be a living being was when I found out that carbon and all the stuff that makes us has to come out of a dying star, like the, that alone, that there's this very strange cycle of these enormous fireballs that forge the material that makes Brian Cox. Yeah. Like what? That, that one alone that there is some strange loop of, of, of biological life that comes from stars, which is like no most elemental thing that we can observe. We see these things in the skin, we see the sun in the sky. It's this all powerful ball of fire and that that is where the building blocks for a person come from. And I said, and they will be from the carbon. That's him tonight, buddy. That you're right. They all got made in stars because they would, does none of it at the big bang.

Speaker 1:          01:05          There's only hydrogen and helium, tiny bit of lithium to be precise, but no, nothing else. And so it was all made in styles and he's probably from different styles. You know, the, the seems in your buddy, they're not all from one style that cooks it and then died. There'll be a mixture of stuff for many styles in your body now. And I agree with you. The, the, what more do you want? You know, when I, when I see people, the guy I want, I want more than that. I wasn't, but you know, there must be more to it. What do you mean the, the, the, we have, we have, we were the ingredients now buddy to assembled in the house of long dead stars over billions of years and the assembled themselves spontaneously and to temporary structures that can think and feel and explore and then there's structures will decay away again at some point.

Speaker 1:          01:50          And in the very far future there'll be no structures left. So, so there we are, we exist in this little window when we can observe this magnificent universe. Why do you want any more? I think to people, well, I think a lot of people aren't aware of all the, all the information, right? And then I think on top of it, for some people it's just, it's so overwhelming the this, this concept of 13.8 billion years of everything to get to this point that we're at right now, it's so overwhelming that they want to simplify it and want to put it into some sort of a fable structure. Something where it's something that's very common and similar and familiar. Yeah. I, I agree and, and, but I think that's the, the, is the, the, the journey that we go on, the real treasure, I think is in that journey of trying to face the incomprehensible.

Speaker 1:          02:50          It's, it's in that realization that it's almost, it's almost impossible to believe that we exist. Right? Yeah, that's right. That's, that's, that's a wonderful thing. Yeah. And I think that that's what I think you miss out. I think if you decide to simplify it, because you don't want to face that, so you don't want to face the infinity that's out there in front of us and you don't want to face those stories as you said, that, that you look at your finger and it's ingredients cooked in multiple styles over billions of years. That that's said to me, it a joyous and powerful thing to think about, and I think you're missing out if you don't want to face that.
