Speaker 1:          00:00          What I've noticed though is I was in Portland, Oregon and there was a whole like city of homeless people. Yeah. In La, it's this just sparklies like Jimmy's on top of an ice cream, you know, you gotta go to skid row skid, you never seen anything like it. Skim Rosa homeless city. It's insane. It's thousands of homeless people wandering through the streets. They, they've taken over entire neighborhoods. Like it is, it is bizarre. It's bizarre. We used to film fear factor downtown. We would a film it at these abandoned warehouses. They would rent them out and we'd, you know, throw people off the roof and shit. And uh, we, there was this one area where you would go where, and I'm not exaggerating, there might be a thousand people on this block, like a concert just let out. Like they were having a homeless concert and they're all just wandering around.

Speaker 1:          00:51          There's needles everywhere and tense and garbage in the streets and, and people just shuffling around, walking back and forth. So there's, I guess there's some homeless centers, you know, where people can go and get food and things and shelter. You know, I'm starting to wonder like, what's wrong with me with you because I seem to focus on that. You know, every city I go to I say, wow. It seems like there's more and more homeless people and other people are saying, oh, let's go to the freedom trail. Let's, let's look at the beauty of San Francisco. Look, I shit on the street. To me that's like unusual. San Francisco has an app where you could find where the people are shitting. They have not jumped through. Pulled it up before. Yeah. There's so many people shitting in San Francisco on the street. San were like my friend Jake shields get a photo of this guy taking a shit right in front of them.

Speaker 1:          01:45          Just shit sprain out of his ass. Running into the street from the side of the street. No, I don't know why and they just do it in front of everybody. I don't know why people, you know who's sick or the person with the APP or the guy taking a dump. Well, I think there's a certain open mindedness that San Francisco has a lot of very progressive open minded people. Which is good, but the problem is it opens the door for some ridiculous stuff like people shitting on the street. There's too many homeless people too. They're too open minded and to liberal. Look at that. That's the, that's the shit map. That's where all the people are shitting. That's a dark puddle of shit where so many people were shitting on the street in that area and I don't even know how they cleaned that up. I mean, what do they do?

Speaker 1:          02:32          They scrape it hose a street down. Is that an extra, is that, are they creating jobs? Let's look at it on the positive side. Maybe those homeless people reminds me of the parades when they stepped the horses. There's nothing you could do either. I mean, what are you going to do? Are you going to give these people a place to live? I'm going to give these people food. You going to give these people money? There's, it's not going to fix their mental illness. That's what people don't understand about a lot of these folks. It's not that they run on bad luck, that's they're not on bad luck. They're mentally ill. They have, their brain's not working correctly. And if they don't want to be on medication and they don't have any way to turn, they don't have anywhere to go. They're going to stay there and they don't have anywhere to shit. And you know, they just want to use this treat. And I don't know if they could put up Porta potties and say for homeless folks only, and what can they do? We're not going to solve that on the Joe Rogan. She might. I'm, I'm an optimistic person. Steve, you never know. I was thinking to myself, he just, you know, it's just shit in your pants.
