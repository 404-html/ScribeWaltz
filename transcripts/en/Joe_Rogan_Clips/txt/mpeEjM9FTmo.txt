Speaker 1:          00:00          The only difference between the sexes is socially constructed obstacles. You are, well, gender's construct gender itself. It is. They should come here and take a look at your place. That would shut them. Shut the argument. That's all male, male, gender. I've got some female stuff here from when my kids come over tonight. Tempa tell, tell them what you said to me when I say what a fucking great place. Oh, this is what happens when women don't get to tell you what to do. A place you have a warehouse of mail, but this looks, that's not a nice guy. That's not bad. And it's been a problem in this society. Male energy, male thinking, male, and he is vilified and you're, you're taught to think that it's something wrong with being masculine. Being masculine is the reason why we don't speak German. Okay, stop. Uh, exactly.

Speaker 1:          00:48          Talk about toxic masculinity. You could, you will be the poster boy for that Shit. Well, the whole reason why you need male people is because there's mail people, other places that will take away your shit and kill your people. And exactly. This is not a bad thing. Male does not equal evil. Just because there are evil men, they are evil men. Doesn't mean all men are evil. There's evil women too. It doesn't mean all women are evil. I dated three of them. I bet he did it more than three, let's be honest. Yeah, no, you're absolutely right. But this toxic masculinity that is his fuss Solera like you said, really World War Two, however there turned out well, there's just so many dumb phrases like that, you know, will they made up, do you know about heteronormative? I'm sure he knows his CIS gendered. CISGENDER.

Speaker 1:          01:36          Hetero normative. Yeah. Like you're, you're imposing the norms. Like as if heterosexuality is normal. Well, did you see what was the story a couple of days ago and I was in California here, a beautiful state of California. They're trying to the heat. You can't say he or she gets they now lat. Yeah. Where everywhere. I'm saying what I'm saying. She, Hannah something Jackson. He uh, yeah. Now you have to say they nope. And they were passing it. They had her in the, the meeting, uh, the actual, uh, town hall. A city. Where are they passing the ordinance? And at the end she goes, my, my grandma, my grammar teacher wouldn't approve of that. She's rolling around her, but we won't hear from her. She said her and somebody called her out on it as she was passing the nonsense. You shouldn't buy your grandmother. She's not here. It was corrected to dentification densification.

Speaker 1:          02:28          Of course she looked like no Gingrich. This, she is California state senator bans the use of he and she during committee hearings. Oh look at her with her perfect fucking little real haircut. Newt Gingrich's haircut pow. It's facing. Some people are just hilarious. But they called her out. She's trying to do a good thing though, you know, and uh, they call her. They had a laugh about it. But uh, that is so funny. Who the fuck does she look like? Oh my God. We wouldn't be hearing from her. Well, you made me. That's what was in interrupted by listeners who corrected her usage and demand. Oh, stop, stop, go back. Corrected her usage and demand that she used the word they or them, they demanded. See this is the problem with all this shit. Yes, it's demanding. They're trying to control people or telling people what to do, what not to do, and it's about power.

Speaker 1:          03:18          A lot of this stuff is about power on as they're imposing their worldview on on you, but it's not even their worldview. It's not real. What it is is they're just deciding that this is a thing that they're going to agree to and they're going to force other people to comply. It's half the game. Half the game is just getting people to comply. Well, you do that by and you start with language. You control people's behavior through language, which is the definition of political correctness. Well, that's what Carlin always said that fascism is just political correctness with good manners are political correctness is fascism with good manners. How bout you saw the clip a Louie had governors when he was talking about this, how the, you know the millennials, whoever demanding what we call them. Yes, they are them I, and he goes, okay, I'm, Louis Goes, okay, I'm a location. It's your mother's car. And he goes, I got to come up with something more clever and not as harsh, whatever. Yeah.
