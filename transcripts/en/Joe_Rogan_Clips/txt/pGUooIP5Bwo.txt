Speaker 1:          00:00          You know, I think people like overall a pretty nice on the highway even in la, but sometimes they're not. Do you think the neuro link will help that client? Probably everybody would be locked in together. This hive mind tunnels will help it. We're gonna have traffic that'll help a lot. Yeah. How many of those can you put in there? Cause I was thinking about travel buddy. That's the thing about tunnels as you can go three d so you can go many levels, right? So until you hit hell yeah, but you could go, you could have a hundred levels of tunnel then bombs. Jesus Christ, I don't want to be on 99 and that'll be the 99th negative 99 floors. Cool. This is one of the fundamental things people don't appreciate about tunnels is that there's not like roads. The fundamental issue with roads is that do you have a tutee transport system and a three d living and workspace environment.

Speaker 1:          00:50          So you've got all these tall buildings or concentrated work environments and, and then then you want to go into this like two of the transport system, which is pretty low density because cars is per spaced out pretty far. Um, and, and so that obviously is not going to work. You're going to have traffic guaranteed. But if you can go three D on your transport system, then you can solve all traffic and you can either go 3-d up with a flying car or can go through ed down with tunnels and you can have as many tunnel levels as you want and you can arbitrarily relieve any amount of traffic. You can go further down with tunnels. Then you can go up with buildings. You're 10,000 feet down if you want.

Speaker 1:          01:37          I wouldn't recommend it. But what was that movie with? What's his face? Bradley Cooper. Not Bradley Cooper. Uh, Christian. Now what the fuck's his name? Who is Batman? Christian Bale, where they fought dragons. Him and Matthew mcconaughey. They went down deep into the earth. How high? How deep can we go, man? Yeah, it was, it was that man fought dragons. Batman. But Reyna Reyna fire never saw that. No Terrell but good. I wouldn't recommend saying bring super far down. Right. Multan yeah. Earth is a drawing ball of lava with a thin crust on the top, which we think of as like the surface, this crust and it's mostly just a big ball of lava.

Speaker 2:          02:27          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:28          that's earth. But 10,000 feet, it's not a big deal. Have you given any consideration whatsoever to the flat earth movement? I think that's a trawl situation. Oh it's not. No, it's not. You would like to think that because you're a super genius, but I as a normal normal person, I know there's people way dumber than me and they really, really believe they watch you two videos which go on uninterrupted and spew out bunch of fucking fake facts very eloquently and articulately. And they really believe these people really believe. I mean if it works for them, I'm sure.

Speaker 1:          03:13          Fine. It's weird that right. That in this age where you know it was ludicrous mode and your car goes 1.9 seconds. Zero to 62.2 2.2 which one's 1.9 the roaster. The next generation roadster. Okay. Standard edition. Yeah. I'm on top of this shit. That's just it. That's just what the standard edition. So it though about the form of package Wa wide performance package. What the fuck do you need a put rocket thrusters on it for real? What are they going to burn? Hot Ultra high pressure. Compressed air. Whoa. Just cold, cold gas thrusters. Did you have to have an air tanks? Are they sucking the air out? Okay. Yeah. I just have an electric pump. Whoa. Pump it up to like 10,000 PSI and how fast are we talking? Zero to 60 how fast you want to go? I'm wanting to go. Could make it fly.

Speaker 1:          04:03          I want to go back in time can make it fly. You make it fly. Sure. Do you anticipate that as being I when you were talking about the tunnels and then flying cars, do you really think that's going to be real, too noisy and this too much airflow so that the fundamental issue with flying cars, I mean if you get work one of those like toy drones, I think of how much, how loud those are and how much air that they, how much air they blow. Now imagine if that's like a thousand times heavier. Hmm. This is not going to be make her neighbors happy. Your neighbors are not going to be happy. If you land a flying car in your backyard, it would be very helicopters like that or on your roof that are just really going to be like, what the hell that it was annoying.

Speaker 1:          04:45          You can't even look if you want a flying car, just put some wheels on a helicopter. Is there a way around that? Like what if they figure out some sort of magnetic technology, like all those, Bob was our type characters were thinking that was a part of the UFO technology. They were doing an area 51 member. It, didn't. They have some, some thoughts about magnetics? Nope. No bullshit. Yes. Really? Yeah. It was a fundamental momentum exchange with the air. So you must, you must accelerate. There's this, like this, there's a sudden you have a mass and have gravity, gravitational acceleration, um, and mass mass times your mass times gravity must equal the massive airflow times acceleration of that airflow to have a neutral force. So it's impossible and then you won't move. But if if mg is greater than MMA, you will go down. And if mas greater than mg, you will go up.

Speaker 1:          05:44          That's how it works. There's just no way around that. There is definitely no way around it. There's no way to create some sort of a magnetic something or another that allows you to technically, yes, you could have a strong enough magnet, but that magnet, it would be so strong that you would create a lot of trouble. We just suck cars up in new your car, his pickup mean mean and she'd have to repel off of either a material on the ground or in a really nasty situation off of Earth's gravitational field and somehow make that incredibly light. But that magnet would cause so much destruction. You'd be better off with a helicopter. So if there was some sort of magnet road, like you have two magnets and they repel each other. If you had some sort of a magnet road that was below you and you could travel on that magnet road, that would work.

Speaker 1:          06:50          Oh yes. Yes. You could have a magnet road, a magnet road. Cause that's ridiculous. No, it's work. I do that too, right? I would not recommend it. There's a lot of things I don't recommend or not recommend that not good. Not Wise, I think no roads, no, no that. No, definitely not. Definitely not. It was good. I would cause a lot of trouble. So you've put some time and consideration into this other than, you know, instead of like my foolishly rendered thoughts. So you think the tunnels are the way to do it? Oh, it'll work for sure. That'll work. Yes. And your, these, these tunnels that you're building right now, these are basically just like test versions of this ultimate idea that you have.

Speaker 1:          07:38          You know, it's just a hole in the ground, right? We played videos of it where you just, the guys that you're going to drop that hole in the ground, there's a sled on it and the sled, he goes very fast. Like a hundred miles an hour plus. Yeah, you can go real fast, fast as you want. And then if you want to go long distances you can just grow the air out of the tunnel. Make sure it's real straight. Draw the air at the tunnel is head of vacuum tunnel. Um, cause the, and then depending on how fast you want to go to any of these wheels or you could use air bearings depending upon the ambient pressure in the tunnel or you could a maglev it if you want to go super fast. Um, so magnet road, yes, but underground magnet roads, underground manga otherwise you're going to really create a lot of trouble with because those metal things, so magnet roads, the way to go just underground.

Speaker 1:          08:31          If you want to go really fast underground you would be in a, you would be maglev in a vacuum tunnel mag in a vacuum tunnel. Magnetic levitation in the back of tunnel one with rocket launchers. No, I would not recommend putting any exhaust gas in the tunnel. Oh okay. I see what you're saying. Cause then you got to pump it on, right? You have to pump it out and you probably have limited amount of air in the first place. Like how much can you breathe? Do you have to pump oxygen into these cubicles to pressurize part? It'd be like a, like a little tiny underground space ship. Basically like a airplane. Cause you have a or an airplane. It's not getting new Aaron. It is, it is, yes. You have like a little hole. Yeah, they have a pump. Really? Yeah. It gets it from the outside.

Speaker 1:          09:14          Yes. Wow. I didn't know that was like, it's the era airplanes have have it easy because essentially you can, they're pretty leaky. Uh, but she's, yeah, so long as they, as long as the air pump is working at a decent speed, they have backup pumps, still have like, you know, three pumps are four pumps or something. And uh, and then that, then there's like, there's an x, it exhausts through the outflow valve and, and through whatever seals are not sealing quite right. Usually the door doesn't feel quite right on a plane. This was a bit of leakage around the door and uh, but the pumps, uh, exceed the outflow rate and then that sets the pressure in the, in the cabin. Now have you ever looked at Torrance and gone, I could fix this, but I just don't have the time. As you make a better design for a plane, you do a better design. I mean, probably, I think it is. Yeah. Oh, who have you talked to about this? And I've talked to friends, friends, friends, and your friend girlfriends and you can tell me, what do you got? What's going on? Well, I mean, the exciting thing to do would be some sort of electric vertical takeoff and landing supersonic jet of some kind of vertical takeoff and landing me, no need for a run might just shoot up straight in the air.

Speaker 3:          10:40          Oh, okay.

Speaker 1:          10:42          How would you do that?

Speaker 3:          10:44          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          10:45          when they do that and some military Aircrafts, correct. Yes. The trick is that you have, you have to transition to level flight. Um, and then you, the, the, the thing that you'd use for vertical Tafe will take off and landing is not suitable for high speed flight.

Speaker 1:          11:04          So you have two different systems, vary quite a lot of thought about this quite a lot. Um, I, the interesting thing about an electric plane is that you want to go as high as possible, but you need a certain energy density in the battery pack because you have to have a calm gravitational potential energy. Once you've outcome gravitational potential energy and you're at, at, at, at a high altitude, the energy use Incruse is very low and then you can recapture a large part of your, the gravitational potential energy on the way down. Um, so you really don't need any kind of reserve fuel, if you will, because you have the, the, the energy of height, gravitational potential energy. This is a lot of energy. So, so once you can get hot at the high, you like, the way to think about a plane is a force balance to the force balance. So a plane that is not accelerating, um, is a, is a neutral force balance. Yeah, the force of gravity. If the lift force of the wings, then you've got the force of the, one of a thrusting device or the, the propeller or turbine or whatever it is and you've got the resistance force of the air. Now the higher you go, the lower the air assistance. Yes, air density drops exponentially, but drag increases with the square and exponential beats of square. The higher you go, the faster you will go for the same amount of energy

Speaker 1:          12:35          and at a certain altitude you will, you can go supersonic with less energy per mile, quite a lot less energy per mile. Then an aircraft at 35,000 feet because it's just a force balance. I'm just doing it for this conversation. It makes sense though.
