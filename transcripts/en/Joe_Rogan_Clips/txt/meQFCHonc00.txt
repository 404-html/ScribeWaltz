Speaker 1:          00:00          I forgot. That's the Joe Rogan experience. It's funny because like there are these chapters, it's like this is all coming full circle to what we're talking about with like Richard Branson on a boat, getting his dick sucked doing coke, but, but here's the thing, there's a cycle and if you hang in there long enough becomes cool again, like if you're hammered and you're 20 and you're out there, how it a party is kind of silly and it's fun, but if you're hammered and you're 60 it's kind of sad. Yeah. But if you're hammered and your 90 it's funny again. Yeah, absolutely. It's going to hang in there. If you're a 90 year old drunk, I got a job out. You all just shocked my Gig, which by the way, apparently the latest in the sexual harassment Olympics, the latest a entry is Stan Lee from marvel comics. Really?

Speaker 1:          00:53          Yeah. He's 95 years old. Yeah. He lives in some giant mansion and he has a bunch of nurses. He's trying to get them all the bloom. Of course now he says it's the shakedown. He says they're all, they're all just trying to get money from them. May very well be the case. She or it may well very well be the case that he is like a lot of 95 year old dudes with 20 million bucks in the bank and about six months to live. Just getting it on. What do you do? You try, you'd go for it. He swing those fucking dice. Come on. Seven Stanley, if he really can. If the enemy, if you're worth, well, hold on. Go back to that. What does it say now? He, okay. He bought someone. Then it was revealed that someone had bought an $850,000 condo in his name without his knowledge.

Speaker 1:          01:44          Yeah, that was last week. I don't know if you're at oh no. What happened? Follow police report after discovering that someone had stolen $300,000 from him. Wow. Using a forged check and then it was a reveal that someone bought an $850,000 condo in his name without his knowledge of fact. It came to light when his team did a full audit of his accounts. Following the forged check, whether this is any way related. Okay. This guy be, he might be being honest. This might be in reaction to the shakedown, the shakedown, but this guy has so much money that someone bought an $850,000 condo in his name, and he didn't learn about it until they were going over the books. Well, he didn't. Yeah, he didn't mind me about it until they found a $300,000 stolen cheque. That's a baller. Yeah. Stanley, y'all and out of control hero. ALTEC kicking kicked fucking ass superhero. Yeah. I'd like to think that he's not the guy who's trying to tell these maids to suck his deck. Naw, I doubt it. I like to think that. Me Too. I want some heroes left a couple of those guys. Phew. But hang in there guys.
