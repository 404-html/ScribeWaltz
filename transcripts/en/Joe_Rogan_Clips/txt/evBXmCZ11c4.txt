Speaker 1:          00:00          Now, what did you think when he said that we're going to pull out a Syria? Well, first of all, yeah, yeah. They just had that, uh, we've, we've lost some servicemen up in northern Syria today, um, today as a result of a bombing up there. Yeah. Isis has taken credit for it. So there, there was a, uh, patrol and we, and we've got roughly 2000, uh, personnel in Syria. And for the most part, what are they doing there where they're providing a guidance training? Um, they're assisting with targeting, uh, uh, and because the, the air power is incredibly important over there right now. And so we are, uh, our personnel are, uh, very much involved in selection of identification of targets, uh, for the air campaign. And, um, so we have these 2000 troops here. President says he's going to withdraw. And then then some of the members of administration started walking that dog back, right.

Speaker 1:          00:56          And saying, man, I know it may not happen right away, but yeah, they just, there was just a routine patrol if there this never really such thing as a routine patrol, but there's a patrol, um, and it got hit. Uh, the military is not releasing a lot of details because they haven't finished notifying next to kin, but, um, numbers so far indicate possibly for service, um, uh, lost. Um, and that's going to refocus, I think Congress and hopefully the White House on what the hell is going on. The problem I've got with it is in terms of withdrawing, look, we could stay there forever and not accomplish the task, right? If the task is to finally, uh, defeat whatever that means, uh, radical Islamic jihadists, uh, Isis, uh, that shit's never going to happen. Not In our lifetimes. We're not going to get rid of that mentality, that, that ideology, uh, the sort of what seems to be sometimes a bottomless well of recruits that they can draw on their ability to morph into something else as al Qaeda did, um, over, depending on how successful we are in a campaign against them, they're like, you know, again, it's, it's, it's, you know, it's like, you know, step on roaches over here and they pop up over here.

Speaker 1:          02:14          So I think it's the, the, the, the biggest problem I've got is, is that if we leave, we're not, we're not, um, you know, it's not like we're engaged in firefights everyday with isis over there. Right. We've left that to our allies and our allies in most part up there in the north of Syria are the Kurds. The Kurds have been our allies in one way or another in that part of the world for a long time now. And it played a very important role. And we have not been particularly honorable over the, over the years in terms of how sometimes we deal with them. If we walk out, if we leave, then uh, Irwin, you know, the head of Turkey, I guarantee you we'll be in there in short order to kill as many of them as possible because that's just what the Turkish authorities are going to till they honestly, uh, that they couldn't be happier with the announcement that we're going to leave because that opens the door for them to then go in there and from their perspective, stamp out the Kurdish alliance that have been our allies.

Speaker 1:          03:21          We're the only thing our presence at small presence, you know, not minimizing it, but it, you know, 2000 troops has been what's prevented them from doing that. So that's, that's the number one issue I've got. The other is I have no idea why any president or vice president or anybody in, in the government ever, not this, this administration or any administration ever thinks it's a, it's a good idea to say we've defeated the enemy. Uh, when we're talking about radical Islam, we've seen it over and over again from previous administration, from the Bush administration. Every time they say, you know, we were, we've done it, mission accomplished, mission accomplished, we beaten al Qaeda, we beat nicest. That's it. There's no upside to saying that. Shut the fuck up. Stop saying things like that. It's again, it's a self inflicted wound at the, because now what's happening. Yeah. The media is not focused on the fact that we've lost servicemen. They're focused on, well, just, uh, just the other day the president said we defeated Isis and the vice president today said the same thing. Now look what's happened. There's no benefit to saying that. And, and, and it's not going to happen anyway.

Speaker 2:          04:23          So, so the goal of being over there is to assist our allies, but also to make sure that these radical factions don't become more powerful and then eventually affect us and attack us. And so we can keep an eye on what they're planning, what they're doing. Is that, is that an accurate

Speaker 1:          04:40          yeah, it is. It, it, it's, it's, it's exactly it. I mean, if you look at, uh, the reason we went into Afghanistan, right, if we go back all those years, Holy Shit. Uh, and that was because the Taliban allowed, um, al Qaeda to establish a beachhead in there for training and for communications and for finance and for plotting and planning attacks outside of Afghanistan against us and our allies. That's why we went in there, aside from just seeking revenge, I see, was to route that out. We then stayed, you know, thinking somehow we were going to turn the tide of history and create some pseudo federal democracy. So that didn't, that didn't work. But the reason now for being in Syria is yes, we, we have done a very solid job of beating back isis, removing their territory and degrading their ability to operate. But we haven't stamp them out.

Speaker 1:          05:42          We haven't defeated them yet. They're still there. And so we've been providing the support and the, again in the form of, uh, weapons, hardware, gear of resources, training, and most importantly a comp, uh, combat air operations, air. And, um, that's been critically important. If we leave, I have no doubt that isis will find some way to rejuvenate, maybe not in its current form, but, and maybe not in the same exact locations, but they don't morph cause that's what they do. They just, they just find a way to adapt. And we already know what's happened in the past when we, when we left Iraq, we saw what happened with the rise of Isis. So, you know, do I want to stay there forever? Absolutely not. But both sides can make a valid argument. One for Stang, one for leaving my, I think the best argument for staying in the, in the certainly short and midterm is to ensure that Erdowan doesn't slaughter a bunch of Kurds who have been working with us. Uh, honorably. Um, you know, I don't know how else to say that. So we'll see what happens. I, the best argument to stay is to protect the people that helped us to protect our allies. Yeah. Yeah. So it's not in our best interest is in the best interest of our commitment and our agreement with them.

Speaker 1:          07:01          Well as is it in our national security interest to, to stay in Syria for example. Look, right, there was this, there's so many levels to this thing and I'm sure right now everybody's listening going off. Fuck Sake. He's not going to disappear down a rabbit hole, but, but uh, yes, I am. Uh, eh. For a while there, there was this, this, this idea, this was ridiculous pie in the sky thought that we were going to get the Russians out of Syria. Never going to fucking happen. Russian said the only port for their Black Sea fleet is in Syria. You know, w w they've been there for decades and decades along with Iran. We're not, it's not going to happen unless we want to go to war with Russia to kick them out of Syria. That's not in our best interest. So is it in our national security interest to keep troops there, to fight and try to minimize Russian involvement in Syria?

Speaker 1:          07:44          I don't think so because we're not going to shift them off that dime without going directly at them. Right. It's in their best interest to stay. And every nation accidents own best interest. Are we going to shift Iran? Are we going to keep Iran from forming but too late for that? They've already got a beachhead there that they're not going to give up. And so he got to set those issues aside and say, well, what the hell are we doing there? Oh we, oh we there simply because we have to, you know, finish the fight against Isis. Well, I, you know, at some point you gotta say, you know, I guess I wouldn't say that we've, we're, we've defeated them, but I think we would say, yeah, we've degraded them sufficiently that we can, we can now operate from elsewhere. You know, we can operate from forward basis in other locations where we're currently, you know, based. Great. But again, I keep coming back to the same thing that, you know, we've, we've worked with the Kurds. Is this in our national security interest? Well, no, I guess it's not, but there's something that tells me it's the right thing to do. And maybe sometimes that's enough, you know, that we should, we should not let [inaudible] have his way and also longterm wouldn't it be in our best interest to honor our commitment and make sure that we, our allies

Speaker 2:          08:56          so that in the future other allies would be more willing to cooperate with us because they understand that once we're committed, we're fully committed and we stay and we stand for something. Yeah. So what's the benefit of getting out? Like the people that see, I think we should get out. Like when, when Trump said he wanted to pull out, like what's his thinking?

Speaker 1:          09:15          I don't think it runs particularly deep. I think it just, I think it's, you know, uh, during the campaign he talked about, you know, stopping the endless wars popular concept right now again, nobody wants to, I mean, what the hell? I mean, I know. And so it will be interesting to see, you know, what today's sad, you know, event does up on Capitol Hill, you know, do they, do they rethink their, the,

Speaker 2:          09:35          the withdrawal or do they accelerate it? So like when they had the buildup in Iraq and it was highly criticized but then it was very effective, like it did do what they intended it to do. Right. And it did knock back the enemy. If they decided to ramp it up worldwide, would that be a solution to any of this or is the opposite, is it better to actually ramp up our defenses domestically and just stay the fuck away from all of these people?

Speaker 1:          10:06          Yeah. Well eventually you can only, I mean you can only do so much I think on the domestic front. Um, and then, uh, you know, if, if they gained sufficient ability and strength, we've seen that from past attacks, I think then, then they'll come after you, they'll come after us. And that's just the way I suppose that's going to work. But I don't disagree with the notion because it's, it is hard pressed. I look, I wouldn't have stayed in Afghanistan. Frankly, I don't care whether they've increased their literacy rate by 2% or built another road or whatever. It doesn't matter. They don't, they don't know what the hell we're trying to sell them. Right. So I don't, uh, I'm not against the notion of getting out, but this one's a tough one. I guess that's what I'm saying is, is that the Syria issue is, I'm real conflicted on because of the Kurds and what they've done on our behalf in the past and how they've suffered and knowing, uh, going years and years back, you know, having dealt with that issue, uh, two and a half decades ago, a long time ago with the Turks and the Kurds, knowing how vicious that could be a, and I don't trust her to Juan as far as I could throw them on a window.

Speaker 1:          11:13          So, you know, I think there's a problem there that we need to, we need to make sure we've talked through thoroughly before we just say, sure, let's get them out of there. You know, what the hell? Yeah. We shouldn't have them there and we shouldn't be there. But like everything else it gets, it's complicated. You would like to think that what they're having conversations like this up on Capitol Hill, you know, between the parties, uh, Republicans in the dems, but I don't think they are.
