Speaker 1:          00:00          Oh, he's unique. What is finding Hitler all about? Um, this is the show that you're on and it's on a and e, is that what's on? Yeah, Amy is the parent network. It airs on history channel and we just had our third season that just finished airing. What's the thought process behind this? This is this, is it legit? Cause a lot of people are like finding Hitler. Get the fuck out of here. They found Hitler. He died. Yeah. I mean not really. We don't know. Right. That that's the, that's the, I mean this isn't like ancient aliens. This is whee. They declassified a bunch of documents. They, both the Israelis and the British and the Germans and Americans in the past 20 years have been consistently declassified documents. And there were a bunch of specifically FBI documents that we were spending millions and millions of dollars actively searching for Hitler after the war.

Speaker 1:          00:50          As was, yeah. Like millions of dollars. Like Hoover was like, no, no, no, no. Send more FBI agents to South America and to North Africa. Go to the Canary Islands, go to Spain. Trying to find out where this guy went. Songs of real FBI documents with real leads, with real informants, some hand or some first I accounts saying that they physical. So anyways, that's the show is us trying to find out, sift through reality and um, the fiction of the, the allure, the mist, the mystery of that asshole. So what's the official story? The official story is that he killed himself, right? Yep. Yeah. Killed himself in the bunker with David Braun. Yup. And is there any photographic evidence of his death or anything? So what the Russians got the body and they got his school. Um, and when they brought it back to Moscow, nobody has ever been able to independently verify who and what this body is.

Speaker 1:          01:58          They let one genetic tests occur and the body and with a bullet holes that they said was Hitler and have said, and that's the narrative. That's a story. That's the all the eye witness accounts that are in even in the vicinity of collaborating with each other and cooperating each other's testimony. Like the closest version, cause none of it seems to be very accurate. Is that okay, here's Hitler skull. And when they did the genetic testing, it's that of a 35 year old woman. So like, oh, well this isn't Hitler, but they've said for the past 80 years that this is Hitler. So, okay, first before we start throwing stones at Russia, let's go back to 1945 April, um, Ma in Berlin, you have the allies coming in, wrecking shop, dropping bombs, blowing everything up. They can in every single which way you have the Russians coming in from the opposite direction.

Speaker 1:          02:53          They don't even have enough guns to arm all their soldiers. So if they have 200 guys or 200,000 guys, they have 100,000 guns at the guy in front of you dies. You just pick up his gun. That's what's happening in April of 1945 in Berlin. So the noose is tightening. There is no, I mean it is chaos and arche pandemonium. This, I mean you couldn't, this is hell on earth is Berlin, 1945. So, I don't know if you could get a real story, a real, the way that we do it now, where we have, you know, this forensic experts that come in and document everything and we'd look at all the different testimonies say this is this exactly how, it's just not, it's not CSI. This is 1945 Berlin. It's crazy. So I don't know. There's, there was no like absolute proof and a lot of Nazis did escape and go to South America. The majority of anyone with power, the Nuremberg trials were not a witch hunt, but it was to close a chapter so we can start moving forward with communism. That's what it was.

Speaker 1:          04:04          The threat of fascism, the threat of Hitler, the, the threat of killing all the Jews, the threat of world domination by the Nazis that threat's gone. What's the next threat? Tommy does this communism, right? So that had to be a closed chapter of our history so we could focus our resources and our efforts to what inevitably was going to, I mean, the wall goes up. We have east and West Berlin, you know, we're already looking at Korea. I mean this, this happens almost overnight, very quickly. No one patents like no, no homies. We need to go all the way to Matt Moscow. This is not the end of our war. And we didn't listen to him. Um, we then had been, you know, fighting communism for the past 75 years. So the ones with power that went to South America, I know a bunch of them went to Argentina.

Speaker 1:          04:49          Uh, they think, uh, they went to Honduras and a few other places where, where do they think they wound up? So what you had in South America, both Chile and Argentina back to back had fascist receipt regimes. You had a person who was part of the Nazi party starting all the way back into the mid thirties. He's the president of Argentina. So the Red Cross, um, they were facilitating that. There was about three different rat lines that guys were able to successfully get out of Europe into South America. Um, and these are, there's no question that we're talking thousands, if not tens of thousands of high ranking Nazis made it there. Tens of thousands, tens of thousands. And I'm not talking like little soldiers. I'm talking high ranking Nazis officer's got guys like Joseph Mengele and Adolf Eichmann. I mean these are the most disgusting despicable humans to exist at the time. If Hill, if Hitler is dead, Joseph Mengele is the guy that would take syringes full of blue ink and inject them and you have blue eyes, Joe, or you have brown eyes.

Speaker 1:          05:53          Let me see if I can make them blue. Oh Wow. And then take twins and start torturing them to see if one would feel the pain. That's Josef Mengele. I mean that's the guy that then in South America was helping, um, high ranking Argentinians have abortions and he set up, um, have you seen the movie Colonia about Koininia, dignity dad, which is that if you're listening right now, almost warn you not to Google it because it is, it was a torture camp that was started by Joseph Shafer, a Nazi and Josef Mengele, the, the doctor of death that escaped trial in Nuremberg and made it, um, at the behest of Parone into Argentina. He set up the hospital at Colonia Dignan Dad, which was another safe house, safe haven for more Nazis in South America. Um, go to my air and David and Ben Gurion, the presidents of Israel, um, they, they took the gloves off and they were just sending an assassin's to try and find these people and killed them.

Speaker 1:          06:53          Um, but what you got in South America were isolated German only communities. You could go into Bariloche, Argentina, and you know, I'd be like, what will it is Migos and they were like Guten Morgen Oh yeah, good morning. Yeah. Sorry. It's 2017. Right? I thought we spoke Spanish here in 2017 you were there and they were speaking German. Yeah. Whoa. Why I'm, I don't look very, I might look more European than I do show is just them seeing me walking on the street and be like, wow. And there's tons of communities. I mean, if you go to Colonia Dicta Dad, which is now called via Bavaria, the Bavarian village, it is a only German wow. In the center of Chile, in the mountains of Chile. Like you, there's no Spanish beans being spoken there. It is exclusively German and these are descendants of Nazis. Powerful Nazis. Holy Shit.

Speaker 1:          07:52          And this is going on right now. Yeah. Yeah. What are these communities like? I mean, what's their ideology or they, I mean, they're pretty white. Yeah. What are they like? I mean, are they, do they espouse Nazi values are not openly so colonia dignity dad? Uh, if you look at the second generation, there's a bunch of, so it was a huge problem for Chile that they tried to hide for years and they got so much power from the torturing that they did at Colonia dicta dad on a whole bunch of other PR, high ranking South American dictators that they're almost untouchable. And this, this is, I mean, you, you, you would blow your mind if you look into this, Joe, you'd, you'd love it. But, um, the second generation, the kids like the grandkids, sometimes they're even more fanatical than the original generation. Have you ever seen this?

Speaker 1:          08:48          Where like if somebody is away from, like when you travel abroad and it's so cool to like to get into the culture and get into the food and get into the, like you're dancing this style and your, you love the flag and you're like, oh, I'm gonna go to a soccer game because we don't go to soccer games in America and I'm going go. But then maybe after like two months, you kind of miss home, you know, and then like a year, you really miss home and then 10 years, like you really, really miss home. And you see the same thing in the United States where it's not really a perfect assimilation. It's not the melting pot where you see generations that are espousing to be more like their ethnic heritage than they are American. You know, they're flying the Irish flag. And like, I'm, I'm Irish, um, what's just times a thousand with these communities because they're exclusively German. Oh yeah. It's pretty cool. Kind of weird. So exclusively German and really missing home. Yeah. Yeah. So in the years later, the second generations I was talking about, um, some of them came to the United States and were high ranking white supremacists that are now in jail and prison for their racial crimes. And they came out of South America. They came out of Colonia dignity ad that came out of bear low che. They came out of Cordova. They came out of Miss Joan as they came out of, yeah. Wow. It's crazy. So that's the show hunting Hitler

Speaker 2:          10:15          fucking amen to spread. How many people are we talking about? All told in South America that can come out of this, I mean tens of thousands went there, but how many German communities and what, how big are they? I mean maybe have 50 German communities. 50. How many people, if you had to guess, a few hundred thousand. Holy Shit. Hundred thousand descendants of Nazis. Wow.

Speaker 1:          10:43          Yeah. And me, and it's weird when you walk into somebody's parlor and it's like you're stepping back in time into Europe. Like I'm walking in, it's, it's 2017 and I'm walking in Buenos Aires, Argentina into somebody parlor. And all of the tile is European and all of the style and all the art is very German. You know, we have like deers and you know, not, not like red stags, what we're talking German, everything, things that Hiller loved. And that's the style. That's everything. And then they come out and like with white gloves, they're holding their GRANDPA, their grandfathers, um, memory box and inside of it, or his war medals from, you know, when he was in the ss or when he was, and it is the respect the, I don't even know the right ones. Yeah. I mean it's like, Whoa, it's the, this is a gift from the pope that they're holding their hands.

Speaker 1:          11:42          White gloves. No, I can't. First of all, Tim can't touch it. That's, but I can appreciate it. And then they tell me the story of every single one of these things and how he got there and how he then went and for the Buenos Aires news can't touch anything. Oh, they wouldn't know cause I come, you'll you're dirty, dirty, dirty American. He's to Brown. Yeah. Fuck man. So we followed the first two seasons. It was really just unraveling the rumors of what happened to Hitler. The third season was my favorite because I actually got to do real work. They said, okay, I got it. The second season I got to bring in more special forces guys. Um, uh, CIA targeter, Nadia, um, who helped my unit kill Zarqawi in 2006 that this is the team that is now looking at real evidence trying to figure out, okay, how did we find Bin Ladin how do we find Secar is our county.

Speaker 1:          12:37          We looked at their associates and we looked at how they move that we looked at how the communicated, we looked at what routes they were using to get to and from places. And then we just started tightening the noose. And that's exactly what we did in this third season was, okay, let's start following the Adolf Eichmann. Let's start following the Joseph main glaze and let's start falling the scores and skis. Um, Hitler's personal body guard that was a colonel in the ss that went on to work for everybody after the war fighting. I mean, fascists do not like communists. So this guy was working for everybody to include the CIA fighting fascism in South America or fighting communism as a fascist in South America in the fifties, sixties and seventies. Whoa. Creepy stuff. Whoa. Yeah. So, so hunting hiller are there any legitimate eye witness accounts of Hitler and South America or potentially legitimate?

Speaker 1:          13:36          Absolutely. Potentially. Whoa. Yup. I witness counts. I saw him get off the boat. I saw him meet here and if it was just some person saying it, it's almost meaningless. Right? But if you look at the context of who this person is, the wealth that they have that they shouldn't have, and I can, can you explain how you got so rich and two generations you're like, okay, your grandpa got here from Germany in 1946. That's weird. Um, and he, he, he's on a legitimate visa with an Argentinian passport, also weird. Um, and now he's a war refugee that's now worth millions of dollars. How does this, how does this work? Um, so, but people, and then this is the hard part. People want to be connected to significant events and especially in small rural areas of the world, um, developing areas like they want, they're so nef, they're so little happening.

Speaker 1:          14:39          They want to be attached to something massive. And like the fact that they saw you boat land on this beach and the pop, the hatch opened and you know, this, these cars were there and they were doing morse code and this guy gets off and he had this little mustache. You're like, well, for you boats can't beach. That's not how that works. You know, and, and, but you know what they're trying to do. They just want to be connected. So, and now we're removed 70 to 80 years from the facts. It, it's has been painful to try to use real science, real investigative tools to try to sift through this lore, you know, what do you think happened? I mean, you've been studying this for how long now? Three years. Yeah. You, if you had to guess, if you had like 1 million bucks, you've got to put it on one side or another.

Speaker 1:          15:33          Did he go there? Yeah. Whoa. I, I would say, man, it's, it's, and that's the first time I've ever said it flat out like that. What would I want to say is the way history is written is wrong. That that's, that's clear. There's no way that we can say he died on this day. This is what happened here is his body. And that's what his physical proof is for sure. The woman that that head yeah, they were saying was Hitler is definitely not Hitler is absolutely not. That's a fact. They don't have Hitler's body. So then our other option was Kate, is it ava? Brahms did. He just grabbed the wrong body. Right, right. So there are still descendants of, of ava and we tried to have them allow us to do it. Then we tried to go through like, um, and they can get DNA off of the skull.

Speaker 1:          16:21          Yes. Meat on it. It's like a tooth. Yeah. Okay. And um, but they wouldn't consent to it. So then we tried to do, you know, like were people have like the, the tree, they're ethnic treat those websites called 23 and me. Yeah. There's like a bunch of them. We tried to go that route, but um, that wouldn't consent to it. Nope. The Eva Braun's family, they just want it gone. They just don't want to, yeah. There are super pissed that we even found them, which was hard, which was really hard. Hold them down and get them to spit in the bucket. Yeah. The uh, I know, I mean, or pull their trash and pull stuff out of there. Now I would totally not do that. Definitely not do that. Um, but I mean, that's how they call it. The golden state killer, right. Was off a fucking cigarette butts.

Speaker 1:          17:15          They got DNA off a cigarette butt. So history's wrong. Wow. Two for it to be black and white like that and fuck man. And if, and again, if you go back to 1945, um, we needed scientists. We needed every single German electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, aerospace, anything. You're on the [inaudible] program. You, do you know any, we will, all of you. Because now it's a race. It's a race. We have the bomb now. We need delivery systems. Now we need to get to the moon. Now we need to, you know, like all of those things are real time.

Speaker 2:          17:50          It's a war, a war of dollars in a wharf. Science. And um, we got all those scientists. Yeah. The Russians didn't, well, they got some sound. Not very many. Operation paperclip was what, what brought over the Wernher von Braun, who was, when you talk to Jews that were in Berlin during the time that Wernher von Braun was running his rocket program there, he would hang the five slowest Jews in front of the rocket factory in Berlin. Just to give everybody motivation to work harder. Yeah. It's the Simon Wiesenthal Center said that if Wernher von Braun was alive today, they would prosecute him for crimes against humanity. He was a Nazi, straight up Nazi. And people, there's apologists that say, no, no, no. He was a scientist. He was forced into doing that. Like, that's like, okay, he's a Nazi. There's photographs of him wearing Nazi garb hanging out with Nazis. He, they, his rocket factory killed Jews like this is, these are all undeniable facts and sent the war ends and they're not Nazis. Exactly how that works. Exactly. But they were for, they were forgiven because they came over and contributed to our rocket program. I'm not that, I'm not that good of a human. I don't have that in me. I don't have that like, okay, it's like.
