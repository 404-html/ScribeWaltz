Speaker 1:          00:00          I find that a lot of people that are, um, that are steadfast in their resistance to vaccines, they, they also believe in a lot of other questionable things. It seems like these things get lumped into these groups of things that they don't trust the government about. Right, right. Yeah. I think that's part, I think that's probably true. Yeah. That's what it slash which was she government, which was, which was inch. Well, you know, it was interesting. So, you know, I said, we know we need to hear from the Centers for disease control and more than the surgeon general. Now they're starting to speak out. But you know, the people counter that said, well part of the problem is people don't trust their government. And I say, well that's true of some, but I think most people, if you know, with the, if we had a, you know, a more visible public health force out there, people would listen to it.

Speaker 1:          00:50          Well, I think that what you're talking about in terms of these poor neighborhoods, in these parents' sides, getting into people's system and affecting cognitive development and what it was, the other one besides Chaga was that toxic. Uriah says, what's the cognitive development? The fact that there's actual cures for these things too, that I estimate an an a paper. There are 2.8 million African Americans living in poverty with toxic horizons. Wow. This is not a rare disease, Joe. This is, this is a common disease, but it's so unknown, but it's occurring among the poor and it's chronic and debilitating affection. It's not dramatic. It's not an 90. It's not killing people. Is this mostly, and this, the climates as well? It's probably, it's more in common in the south and the north. Is it because they've long, longer time to do this because the eggs, the eggs are in the environment and the worm develops within the egg.

Speaker 1:          01:39          Is there any other diseases that are going on that we don't know about? Um, yeah, yeah, sure. Um, there's other, there's a brain parasitic infection called cysticercosis. That one is from eggs. Um, often from individuals who have a tapeworm. Uh, so that's where we're seeing cases of that. Um, there's, uh, some of the viruses transmitted by mosquitoes. One of the ones we don't talk about a lot, which is a very serious infection, is West Nile virus infection. That's got very high rates of not only encephalitis, but also, uh, one of our faculty members, Christie Marie is showing very high rates of depression and other neurologic debilitation four. And that's another one we could probably use a vaccine for, but there isn't the market incentive to do it. West Nile virus does come up though the, at least that's discussed in the news and people are aware of it.

Speaker 1:          02:33          You said it right, but there's no vaccine, there's no vaccine. But there could be, what does it there could be holding it back. What's holding it back is lack of market forces, lack of financial incentive for the pharmaceutical companies to take it off. Um, so if there's an extremely large investment to develop something along those lines. That's right. I mean, and vaccines are for an investor's perspective, tough sell because you know, there's a possibility, you know, first of all, you need many years of clinical trials. It can sometimes take two decades from the original conception of a vaccine to actually going through a clinical trial. So the hook where vaccine, I've been working on a, we've been doing it since the 1990s. So we're talking decades long time horizons. When you talk to an investor about something with decades long time horizons, you figure it out, right?

Speaker 1:          03:23          The light, the lights go out. I mean the, uh, very, very quickly. So we're, it gets gross, right? Because this is all, we were relying on these private businesses to invest money to cure a public health issue. That's right. That's right. That seems kind of crazy. Well. So in response to that, what happened was after the Ebola fiasco in 2014 where we didn't have any bowl of vaccine and Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, a group of individuals came together at Davos, the World Economic Forum, and I'm including the gates foundation and they put around, they put developed this concept or which at an organization called Sepi, the Coalition for epidemic preparedness innovation to incentivize a biotechs and pharmaceutical companies to embark on a diseases for which of pandemic potential like Ebola, like last of fever, like mayors, corona virus infection. And that was great. But the problem was they didn't address these poverty related diseases.

Speaker 1:          04:25          So those of us who are working on poverty related diseases are still kind of on the outside looking in. It just seems like having everything managed by private companies that need to, they, they need to have some sort of a financial incentive to attack these diseases. That seems like a crazy way to deal with health crisis. That's right. That's right. And so what I've recommended, as I said, the set that organization Sepi is great for what it's doing, but we need another mechanism. What I've proposed is that since these diseases are so common among the poor and the g 20 countries, these are the 20 largest economies to put together public sector funds for that purpose. Public sector funds for investing in developing vaccines and treatments for poverty related diseases, these chronic debilitating diseases. And in fact, you know, we can show that the using working with health economists, we actually work with a terrific health economist.

Speaker 1:          05:24          His name is Bruce Lee. Evolve all names. He's a professor at Johns Hopkins and Ai Right now. He loves it. Um, um, and he's able, he's been able to show 'em that our vaccines are not only cost effective, there cost savings, meaning that they're economically dominant, that they'll actually save money. The problem is you still doesn't help you with the fact that you still need some, but the return is on public health. You still need somebody to come along and provide that investment. So, you know, so what's happened is our, our technical ability to develop vaccines has outstripped our, our, our financial instruments that we have to do it. So I get a stream of young people, uh, in my office wanting to go into global health. I mean the commitment for this next generation and know they get a lot of bad press, but my impression is this next generation, their commitment, the public services and an all time high and they say, you know, Doctor Hotez, I'm all in, I'm going to go into global health.

Speaker 1:          06:20          And there are a little bit disappointed when I tell them get an Mba or get a law degree because where we need the innovation now is in the, it's in the finance sector, there's a, there must be a business model out there that would work that would figure out how to do this. I just don't have the background to do it. It seems like once the momentum is in the corner of this being handled by the private sector and that the private sector has to develop these vaccines and these treatments and they have to do it with some sort of financial incentive. If they don't have a bucket of gold at the end of the rainbow, they're not going to take a ride. That's right. That's right. So that's crazy. It's crazy. The reality. And so, um, what the exciting thing about what I do is, you know, developing these vaccines for poverty related diseases as there's no roadmap right now, there were in clinical trials, I don't know what the roadmap is to get to licensure and getting these vaccines out to the public.

Speaker 1:          07:18          The terrifying thing to thing it keeps me up at night is there's no room. Right. Both good about good. Yeah. There is. How much does it cost to get a vaccine? I mean, in general, from developmental period to actual app? Well, the pharmaceutical companies have traditionally said billions, but I don't think that's the case. I think one of the reasons, um, why they're doing that is because they're also recovering their r and d costs. You know, they're putting money into R and, d that they, that they re that they charge in order to either make a profit or at least a eve. And so for instance, the cervical cancer vaccine, the HPV vaccine that, you know, when I last look was $420 for the three doses, it doesn't take cost $420 to make that vaccine it, it's just that they're recovering their r and d costs, which is, which is fair enough. So one of the things that we're proposing to do for our neglected disease vaccines is we'll d link the R and d costs. In other words, if we've gotten grants, whether it's from the gates foundation in the past or, or the Nih or the European Union or the Dutch government or the Carlos Slim Foundation, we're not going to pass those costs on a, we'll just, you know, that was used for r and d and we would just cost for the cost of goods. So at least we can get it down to just a couple of dollars, a dose, a few dollars a dose.
