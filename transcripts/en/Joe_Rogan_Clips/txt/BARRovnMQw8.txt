Speaker 1:          00:00          Somebody was telling me about this. I was at a little kid's party and I was talking to one of the dads and he was telling me, um, about this, uh, thing that happened, this, I think it was in northern California. It was a fire in fucking might not have been northern California was a fire. And um, the, initially they thought it was just a fire, but then the CEO and his vice president, we're both of their houses caught fire. So then they thought it was like an attack on bold people and then they realize no, it was a murder. And one of the guys killed the guy and his family and then lit his house on fire and then went back to his house and lit his own house on fire to make it look like they were going after both of them. And he's the only one that survived.

Speaker 1:          00:49          Yeah. Whoops. That just happened in New Jersey. A Guy, he's in New Jersey. Maybe that was it. A guy murdered his whole family. His own family. Yeah. And then lit the house on fire. So maybe that's it. Maybe I'm getting a fucked up version of the story. I get drunk a kid parties too. Oh, it's the only way to go by family massacred disguised as a massive fire New Jersey. Yeah, that's it. This is the story. So, um, make that a little larger please. It says a, there was more than a brotherly bond between Paul and Keith. Yeah, that's right. Part of New Jersey vacation together and settled about 11 miles from each other in the suburbs in New Jersey. But two days before thanksgiving, a horrific chain of events would forever tear them apart. Oh, his brother. Yeah, that's what it is. So I was getting a really fucked up person.

Speaker 1:          01:32          This story, Paul, how do you say that name? Kenario. Ken Arrow. Arrow. Arrow Kenny. Oh, candy churros brothers killing his youngest brother, his sister in law and their children. Oh, this is what's fucked up. Like what, what, how does a guy go from never killing anybody to killing a wife and daughter? So he killed his brother and his brother's whole family. Oh my God. I thought he handled his own. Danny said is home, home on fire with his wife and daughter inside. Tried to make it look as if the whole family had been targeted. His family got out of the home safely. Oh, can you imagine the panic? Like what the fuck man murdered these people don't scroll, go back, go back. You let your own house on fire and you're like, can you imagine like while your lighting your house on fire thinking like the, the intensity of this is going to work.

Speaker 1:          02:25          I'm going to get out of this, this, this, this is where the plan goes and Poof, it's really fun. How does a person kill? I mean I understand you're mad at a guy and you fucking hate each other. Fuck you. Fuck you. And you start fighting and then you wind up killing each other. How do you kill his wife and daughters? How do you do that? What, like what switch goes on? Like is he just trying to yeah, cause he's just walking around and go back up. It says it's killed. His sister in law had said he's [inaudible], he's accused of killing his younger brother. His sister in law and their children. Like how many, like who would, hey, you killed kids. Yeah. So this is a guy who's never murdered anybody just walking around cults. Nick Township, New Jersey. Yeah. He's a businessman. Probably never done anything really major in his life.

Speaker 1:          03:11          Probably like, was that a, uh, like a business meeting like two days before with some guy? What the fuck man? Just living his life, talking about the giants. Like what the fuck? What is that? His wife and his two daughters. Oh, several twists in the case of Matt, he then allegedly said his own home on fire with his wife and his daughters inside. Did you not hear me say that? I thought you were talking about is his brother's family? No. No. He killed his brother and his family. Set the house on fam on fire. Then led his own house on fire to make it look like he was being targeted. I knew that, but I didn't know his, he had kids in, yes, his wife and his daughters were inside. Oh my God. To try to make it look as if his whole family's being targeted, his brother and him. Oh my God, it's family. Got Out of the home safely. Wow. Fucking unbelievable. Think about his kids right now. We're like, what? To dead? What? Yeah, what Jesus Christ. He, oh my God.

Speaker 1:          04:10          Killed before sunrise. Scroll up there. Somewhere between midnight and 5:00 AM Paul. Kenny Arrow was walking around his brothers. One point $5 million colts neck home armed with a knife and a gun husband in front of the white mansion with a deadly confrontation unfolded. Paul fired multiple shots. Striking Keith fucking a when you got mad at me for not following the story clearly. Did you feel like you could kill me? No, not yet. I need more than need more than Jesus Christ. He walked inside, found his wife's, uh, found Keith's wife, Jennifer. He shot and stabbed her and then stab their children. Jesse 11 and Sophia Eight. What the hell? Then he took some documents instead of firing them. You spent, what were they doing like the week before fucking stabbed an eight year old dude, an eight year old girl in her sleep. How do, how to fuck to someone in her sleep and her sleep?

Speaker 1:          05:11          Well, it was 5:00 AM it doesn't matter man. He's, there's gunshots in the house. The kids might have gotten up. Oh my God, good Lord. What a monster. A monster. What was this guy like the month before? Like what the hell could that normal looking house shit that is the normalist look normal house ever. Do you believe that there isn't always a presence of good and evil in the world, like like that it's not just evil deeds. What this guy did was evil, but do you believe that there is a real presence of evil? That it's like a thing that takes over people or takes over, you know what I mean? Like,

Speaker 2:          05:58          like, like, like good and evil. Is that more than just people's actions or is it like a force of nature? Is there a good force of nature and an evil force of nature that is constantly using people and using things as, as a catalyst or as far as a instrument?

Speaker 1:          06:15          Well, let's break this down. I don't think nature's the right way to approach it because I don't think there's good or evil in nature. I think nature, nature is actually far more moral than humans are because what? With nature's just about survival, right? Predators and prey and they kill things and eat things. But when animals in nature kill, like what they call surplus killings were wolves will kill like 18 elk and not not eat them. They're just, there's this going on their instincts. These things are there to be killed and they, they can get them because they can't run away. Maybe it's thick snow or something like that. So they just can't help it. They just tear them apart because their instincts are the drive them to kill because that's how they survive. That's other family survives. They're killing and they, they, they're eating these elk and this is just what they do.

Speaker 1:          07:00          And even if they kill a bunch of them where they can't eat them, their instinct is to kill because that's how they survive. It's natural. It's normal. With humans it's very different because with humans there's consequences, right? And there's law and there's other humans finding out. So there's deception and then there's, there's selfishness and there's the, the fear of getting caught. And then there's your own, your own survival instincts in terms of like, you don't want to get locked up in jail. You don't want to get caught for something. So I think if I had a guess that this guy didn't think he was gonna kill this guy's wife and family probably didn't even think he was going to kill this guy. They probably got into a heated argument and they, they're stupid. And He, you know, he's Guinea, he's, that's my people. They do stupid. Your people too. Canny air, they do stupid shit. You know, they're, they're fiery people. And those, those fiery people. I swore off Italian girls and I was 21 I had an Italian girl take a swing at me when I was 21 I was like, that's it for me. I'm done. I'm like, I'm not hitting one back.
