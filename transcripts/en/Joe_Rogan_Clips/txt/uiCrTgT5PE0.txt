Speaker 1:          00:00          I left before it ended. I was at a friend's party and went to a Superbowl party. It was fun. The lowest viewed one in the last 10 years. Are you serious? Yeah, but not by a lot, but yeah, it's cause they knew that that handsome man was going to take your shirt off. Oh God. His name Adam Levine. That's beautiful. Mass. No nipples or everyone's time as Nicholas. Now he has nice Brown nipples, but then we're like Janet Jackson, like the big crazy. He loved shows, nipples. Both. This is bullshit. Sexist bullshit. And his Dick Route. This is, oh my God. He had dick route showing God is bullshit. He just wanted everybody know he's got beautiful tattoos and a fairly good body. Yeah. He does a lot of squats though. Right? That's what's interesting. He's around like the greatest super athletes in the known universe. Actually. Looks pretty good right there.

Speaker 1:          00:48          Oh, for today he was, it was pretty good. Those random for today was, I mean, he's not always around the greatest super athletes, right? No, no. Yeah, yeah. Um, yeah. It looks pretty good. He looks like he's in good shape. Happy to take your shirt off with his California stomach tattoo. But the point being that guys around freaks, he's around six foot, five, 290 pounds, super athletes who could jump over his fucking head. They literally could run through a hundred of him like they were paper walls, just raw. That's what he's around. He's around the fucking super bowl, the greatest physical specimens in the known universe. And he takes his shirt off like, hey bitches, I'm here too. They had an event set up over the weekend. Uh, so people can test their 40 speed, uh, up against other NFL times, whatever they had. Like, oh, that's hilarious. Hussein bolt did it and it's in his shoes. They said street shoes, whatever. But he didn't have cleats on. He tied the fastest ever. NFL 40. He's probably dealing with a full stomach. He probably just eight track a couple of beers. Fuck it. I'll, I'll show these bitches. What's up?

Speaker 1:          01:58          Yeah, it's just, it was weird, like watched it on TV. Do with a shirt off, you know, like, oh, this is a different thing now. Now, this is like a sexy concert for, it was like a football. That's what I think he's getting shit for it because he didn't need to take a shirt off. Right. You know, he had his shirt on and then like after it is second songs, like you know what, let's get sexy and this Superbowl bowl. No, no. But I mean, why else would he take off this shirt? I mean, at least make it a Hashtag. Hashtag sexy in the Superbowl. It's getting sexy up in this bitch. Well, he's a sexy man. Can't, don't be hating. Beautiful Man. Yeah, I mean, but, but that's the whole thing. You're, you're audience is a bunch of guys. You know my jacket on, I'm sorry with Jack and on.

Speaker 1:          02:39          Well, it was cold out at first, but then he started to warm up a sweat cow. Never trust white men with Nicholas's. That's my message now. He's got the little necklaces and the bracelets for the Falcons to land on. Wait a minute. Those are spiritual necklaces. If you have wooden beads for whatever reason that makes you spiritual or gold. I can't even tell you allowed to wear wooden deck assists cause like people go, oh, you're like really endorse organic stuff. He really into macro, but that's gold is gold. That's like the other one was just weird lighting. I can, I can't wear necklaces, man. It, it bugs me. Did you ever wear necklaces? Necklaces? Sure. Yeah. It's never been a staple, but it's a, it's a, it's a weird thing if, first of all, if it's, if it's big enough, it's like this target, right? If you have like a bail gold necklace, people want to steal it.

Speaker 1:          03:28          All right. There's a lot of necklace snatchers out there, Brian. I don't know if you know that. Yeah. But then the other thing is like, what are you doing? What are you doing with that big old shiny thing around your neck? What are you doing? What do you a chick remember in the nineties chokers worry thing and I used to wear a choker. How gross is that? Like a dog choker? It's just a really tight necklace. Yeah. Hemp necklaces. Oh yeah, those were the little bead. The bead at the bottom. The beads critical. Got To have the bead. Yeah, multi colored bead thinking. Look, your cool. Yeah, like it's weird like with like some guys will wear like little anklets with like beads. Can they tie them off and they'll walk around barefoot and you're like, okay, hmm. What's kind of like that? Look that that you're not shop. Look where you have like the really tight, like your pants to go up so you can see your socks. You know you show a little leg. You know why they do that? Why sneakers? Those gods show off the sneakers up full snake. That's what shop told me. Do you do that Jeremy? That's what my, my pants have that actually for you.
