I come over here, there's a gay man and he I call you out of the room like, oh do me a favor, get that mother fucker out of the room. Or if not, you can't talk to them. You can't approach him a certain way. Cuba experienced a lot of progressive ideology. Like is it, have they changed the way it's very progressive now. What's caused this cause they really do a rebel progress changing things. Yeah, but their progress. I mean there are so isolated, they didn't have the Internet right? They don't have the Internet.

Speaker 1:          06:09          What's, what's Nice is you go to Havana and you kind of disengage from modern technology. I love it. I mean you couldn't live there cause he can't really do business there. Right. But you just kind of disengage from. And is it easy to travel there now as far as like flights from America?

Like we haven't even touched. I'm like, I was raised by Omega seven guy. Like he grew up with my father. So I told Joey when I first met him, and I was sort of almost done with this book. I said, I said, when you read it, you're going to need to sit down. Because for a guy like him, he knew a lot. And I knew he would come across names that he knew, but there's no way you could have been part of this and known the whole thing. Right, right. So you, you like, you knew who thought it was. You knew he was a bad guy. He didn't know [inaudible] was a professional assassin for Omega seven.

Speaker 1:          07:42          I knew thought they killed my mother warned me and my mother used to go, when he picks you up at school, please don't get in the car with him cause he's going to get shot one day and I don't want to enter people new battle. And they knew some things about him but they didn't know, don't want who was part of it. They thought they knew the whole story. But there's no way you could've, you couldn't done it all. It, it blew my fucking mind. I went to a dance with my daughter and I came home and the book was waiting for me, you know, Amazon and drops it off in front of your house. And they had ripped it and there was other kids and other moms with my wife and I don't like did was put it in my office and when I opened it I saw a.

Speaker 1:          08:17          Dot. D and Munchie and my fucking knee dropped like it had hit me. He kept texting me as you were reading at 12 o'clock at night and I go, you have no, but I didn't know that this guy used to go every six months and his wife was tight. You know the story I told you about, my mom would play cards and then I would put tidy whities on and dance for the women to be shots of Tequila and make me dance. Neda was in that book. Nina is in that book. When my mother died, I gave me to my dog. I couldn't take that dog. So I used to go to Nina's house on 51st street and cry in the dog house. Like this was my dog. So as soon as I saw Tati, I knew he was onto something because Dottie was my father's friend and he was a type of guy that would come visit me every week just because he was my fault, his friend, and give me 50 bucks and take me to the city.

Speaker 1:          09:09          You get haircuts with his claim to fame was in the seventh grade. My mother told him, I don't know what I'm gonna do with him. He's got some fucking girlfriend. He won't even talk to me. This guy came to my house and gave me a capsule and right in front of me, he filled it up with coke and he goes, let me tell you something. Seventh grade, seventh grade, he goes, next time this girl comes over, you sprinkled his coke on a pussy and you lick it. And I'm like, I didn't even like a pussy that I hadn't touched that outside the genes, that coat capsule was in my draw for like a year, like in the back of my nightstand. Right. I didn't, you know, I wasn't out. It wasn't a driving, nothing. At one night, my mom came home with three cocktails, and then she's like, I got fucking news today from Tophi that he gave you cocaine. What the fuck is, I got some my draw it and use it. She fucking smack me. She goes, don't you have a fucking take drugs and I, she wasn't dead it, Eh, you know what I'm saying? Then she went and did the blast, but that guy, when I was in the [inaudible], Greg gave me a capsule of coke. Wow. And said, put it on a bus. You drive a four pack. Like that's how good he was.
