Speaker 1:          00:00          I like this is two banks. Should we take couple rips right now? Okay, that is fucking awesome. This is a here, here, here's your own little joint. We're like, we're in like this wave of like being evolved and not being involved at the same time, like technologically spectacularly evolve to the point where we can bend matter and create nuclear weapons and fly robots to Mars and take pictures and send it back to us. Like the shit that we could do is off the charts when it comes to like technology and our ability to manipulate the world around us and create giant buildings and structures and airplanes and bridges and shit. But the monkey interaction thing is still not very good, so we still have war. We still have places where we send people over with metal tanks and guns and shoot people and protect people from the other people that are shooting people and get involved in all these fucking crazy things are physical interactions as organisms are just still in this barbaric stage.

Speaker 1:          00:59          We're still in this one tribe going after another tribe stage from 20,000 years ago, 30,000 years ago. It's like the same programming, but now this programming can fly jets filled with missiles and shoot them out of the sky. Sneak up on you underwater in a metal tube, a submarine. It shoots fucking nuclear with missiles and shit underwater. I mean we're in the weirdest flux. We're in this weird sort of unbalanced period in the evolution of the human organism because we can do so much and then put Donald's in charge man about fucking everything. We're mad about men who decide they're women who want to use the girls' room. We're mad about everything. We're about about religion. We're mad about rights and gender and everything. Everything. We're mad, everyone's mad. Fuck Roseanne Barr, everyone's bad. Everyone is so mad and while all this is all this weird personal interaction, shit is happening that's distracting the fuck out of us.

Speaker 1:          01:59          The more it ramps up the the better. Ai gets our foot artificial intelligence because it gets just keep working on it and keep getting better and better. We're going to be in like a full on rock fight. When AI goes live, it's like, it's like we're, we're falling into this whole, like if this was a trap, if I was artificial intelligence and I knew how to be like, well as what we'll do is just go back in time and set people up and make them make us. We'll just plant this idea in their heads and just like an aquatic worm makes a caterpillar or one of those grasshoppers rather jump into a pool and drowned itself so that it could swim out of its brain. You ever see one of those things happen just like that. Ai is doing that with us. They give us Shiny Samsung Galaxy note nine look at how big the whole pottery is and now it takes photos of your face and knows your face.

Speaker 1:          02:50          They can tell you face to face id and fingerprints and before you know it, listen, we found the best way to get a signal to talk. People there, you just stick it in your ass. It's a little palate. We're going to put our little robot Dick in our ass, a little pepper that pellet. If you could just hold in your ass. It's smooth. Do you barely know what's in there? But it connects with your, your ass is open. It's not like the rest of your skin and y'all got to keep it in your mouth. Right. Well to ask is the way to go cause it's like open, you know, it's not like you don't have to go through the dermis and so that just just connects with you and you can fucking see augmented reality. But the little tiny robot dick, it's about that big.

Speaker 1:          03:27          You barely feel it. It's like a BB. Uh, that's what's going to happen dude. Fucking prior. I do. These things are growing or not the anti aging shit too. Who knows how crazy that's going to get. I think with the weirdest thing is not the anti aging. I think that we're going to run into biological limitations. I think the weirdest shit is gene editing. Fuck yeah. It's took a turn for the stoner gene editing scares the shit out of me. Was that unexplained on the explain that new Netflix, Netflix show, gene editing and how did that shit's going to go wild wild country. I only watched the first episode, but I was like, Holy Shit, I see where this is going to follow show baby. Fuck everyone man. As far as tech and I'm like, it takes a turn, but I'm sure he still had good intentions.

Speaker 1:          04:20          I think trying to build the community, I'm just passionate about us. Again, this is the thing, it's the fucking human interaction part is the part that we can't get right. It's real weird. If you look at all the different kinds of interactions that we managed to successfully navigate and me, people have obviously have problems in business and there's lawsuits in business and there's people that get fired and there's all sorts of problems with people doing business, but overall they get a lot of things done right. Like business keeps improving. Things keep getting better. We barely improve with how we treat each other, like the way human beings treat each other. We barely get better at that and we do react to things better. Like, if we're mad at someone for doing something that's like more clear with like agregious violations of our code, right? Like racism, like this Roseanne thing, it was a big one, right?

Speaker 1:          05:12          Everybody was like, no fucking way. We're not tolerating that. Fuck her. And then ABC like, Yo, fuck it. We're pulling the plug on the show. It's like immediate reactions. Yep. So it's like what I, what I'm, I don't think it was right. I think she's got a lot of problems and she's taken a shit load of pills and she was all fucked up. And I know she's not racist. At least she tells me that. But what I do know is that racism is horrible and people just don't want to tolerate it anymore. And that's what the good thing is. The good thing is like this, right? There's overwhelming response from people that they're not tolerating racism anymore. You can't do that anymore. We won't tolerate it. And this is fairly new man. I mean with the civil rights marches, that was in the 60s right? I mean, think about what was going on in the 50s and the forties and fed that shit.

Speaker 1:          06:01          That was not that long ago in terms of like how long there's been people. So we're dealing with this radical change in this regard, but very little change in like our kindness to each other. Yeah, that's right. Did start the American mushroom day or not the American, the worldwide. Are you sure fear has a holiday that he created called true fast? Yeah. It's several days are doesn't fuck around our, he has had a real job since he was the doorman at the comedy store. He operates on its own schedule. That's, that's what it's going to take for something like that worldwide to change. It'll certainly help cause shrimp fest certainly out she's rooms will help. I'm promoting that. But I feel like I'm, part of it is because we're scared. I legitimately feel like we're scared. And I think when someone like Trump is in office, we're more scared because we realize how easy it is for, uh, you know, I hate to use the term regular person cause he's definitely not a regular person.

Speaker 1:          07:00          He's very successful and very famous and everybody knew who he was, but regular person in terms of we don't, that's not how it politician acts like that. This is like some crazy show man. And when a crazy show man becomes the leader of the thing, whether or not he's doing good is it, I'm not even arguing politically whether it's doing good or bad or the economy's up because of him. I don't know. But it's just how he behaves. It's who he is like that that freaks people out. That makes people more on edge. And so they're more angry and they're, they're, they're, they're more looking to call people out on things and they're more looking to stomp out racism. I get it. Imagine what people would think if someone like Sam Harris was a precedent or something. He was talking about a national mushroom day are talking about that stuff.

Speaker 1:          07:42          How bad people would freak out. Seriously. They would freak or are they just people that disagree with Sam too? You know, there's a ton of very, very smart people that disagree with Sam, you know, and it's really interesting to see those disagreements. Cause when really high level intellects debate each other about things or disagree on things and you get to see not just their ideas play out and how their ideas work against the other person's ideas. You get to see that, but you also get to see like thinking and, and, and, and communicating at a super high level, right? They're intellectuals are trying to outsmart each other so that they're debating about, you know, the existence of God or whatever the fuck it is. When you get really smart people who disagree on Shit. Very fascinating. It's like one of the more interesting things to watch. So like in a lot of ways, high level Jujitsu, you know, and a lot of ways you're watching like, oh, okay. And those guys, a lot of them get into like, Harris is in a Jujitsu, is he? Yeah. I think that's one of the reasons why he's into it. It's cause he's kind of doing Jujitsu when he's, when he's doing these debates.
