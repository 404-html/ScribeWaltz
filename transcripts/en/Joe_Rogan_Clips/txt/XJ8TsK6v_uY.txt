Mr. Steal your girl at that picture. I wish I go. Okay, so here's the question. We're in the round three now, right? It's four 44 axes down to let's be, I would say, right if you had to look at this scorecard, but interesting rounds, right? The Max has got his, both guys have gotten things off, but all the looks fucking sensation to the second round was little inch of the first round. I was like, well, Mexico, Brandon, please make tee shirts. You're crazy. I was interested in the first round. I'm saying that first round though, Max really got outclassed. I don't think there was a big long period the beginning of where everybody's waiting for somebody to move to.

Yeah, this Brennan please both of them. Although it that sweet need. I know. I don't know. I'm hating on all though. I don't get it. Oh, I'm Max the wind for some reason. You know what? One of the best things that's ever happened at a being a commentator is learning how to appreciate just a performance [inaudible] favorite. I always had favorites, man. Always when I was early right hand. I try not to now, but like if somebody that I'm friends with, like if cowboy fights, it's the worst. It's hard. It's hard for me. Very, very hard for me to call it. Your fights were the hardest I've ever had to call. Really hundred percent so hard I've ever had a call. So you have to like, oh my God, oh, he's hurting. It's not over yet.

God Damn fucking Hawaii Shit. Max Holloway.

Speaker 1:          04:39          You know what man? Aldo, he's shaking his head because he still wanted to be able to fight and it's a reference call to stop the fight and he's very upset about that. He was stuck, but man, it seemed legit to me. That was a legit stoppage. It seemed legit to me. Oh, you know it's legit. Eddie had criminal use. Legit. Legit, right? Yeah, I do. Yeah, I would. I would imagine. I like this. I liked this. I liked it. That big John. Let it go. That long fight change. You rarely see he took a beating for like two minutes straight. Yup. Yup. Came back, man. You got tagged. It's just sad. That white girl.

After he knocked out, we got a wheelchair.

Look at that. Oh my timing with that right hand is perfection. He's on top of them. Drop some bombs on them. There was a couple of times in the fight where it looks like it looked like Aldo went out, put his will, his will and his need to fucking get through this.

Speaker 1:          06:59          Like right there, Bang. Come on man. Is to be Josie Aldo. Just once in a kind of freak fight with Conor to beat him like this. I mean Max Holloway beat the shit out of him. He beat him in a way that no one's ever beat him. Blessed and kept going to him and he beat them in a way that no one's ever beat him. Connor only beat him cause he caught him. Max Holloway beat him down and beat him. US beat him down. He's got through the gauntlet. How big is that tall or we can be Hawaii and fighting his fucking shy and I've been singing Hasees, Bj Penn, and own that island. I've been singing that kids praises for a long time. He is, came into the UFC super for Josie to oh yeah. Who's the guy in the background holding that devastated like it's his, it's the worst devastation.

This is fighting and people win and people lose. And the the sport ultimately, it depends upon these sort of fights. It depends upon these all time greats like Aldo facing some guy who's got the solution to what that guy presents. Yup. And that's what although did tonight. How do you mean? He went out there with all of his championship medal and he laid it all on the line. He fought his best and his puzzle got solved by the new breed of, let's hear, let's hear what he has. It's condominium. Both of these guys give us some volume cause I know Harvey pause guys, they beat him with a torn ACL at a title wrapped around it a long time ago. Still is incredible
