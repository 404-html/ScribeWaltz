Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. Interesting. Gorgeous. George was crazy. Yeah. Interesting. Was a stupid ad. You have to watch for the Olympics there. Boy, I'm this Olympics is, I think I'm going to say this. I think the Olympics are gross. This is why I think the Olympics are gross. I think it's a great opportunity for all those athletes. I think it's great for people to watch it, but I think it is a fucking disgusting money grab and all those amateur air quotes. Athletes don't get paid shit with them and these companies are making billions and billions of dollars off of them and I really wish they would all quit. I really wish they would say, fuck you pay me. I really wish they would just go straight ray Liotta they give a fuck. You pay me. They get up there. They're youth for that. Not only that, the fucking companies, they're so restrictive, they're the IOC and all the people that are behind it are so restrictive and they are making ungodly sums of money, ungodly contracts.

Speaker 1:          01:00          They're just giant contracts to air the, the Olympics, giant amounts of money to build the stadiums and set up, these are these events and that everything is about net nationalism and national pride, whether it's in Korea or Russia or wherever the fuck they do them. But meanwhile, the athletes don't get dick. They don't get Dick. If you're lucky and you're Michael Phelps, you become famous out of it. And you get a bunch of commercials, commercials and endorsements and you make a shit load of money that way. But how many Michael Phelps is, are there was a three or four, I mean how many, but how many in the, all the, all the Olympics and out of all the Olympics, Jamie, you're a sports fan at all the Olympics, say like the Olympics this year. Well, let's go to the last one. Who the fuck came out of it?

Speaker 1:          01:42          Where they're a household name? Right now you've got Shaun white and maybe I heard of that guy. The girl that won, uh, Kim is her last name last night or two nights before the real famous. Uh, there's Lindsey Vaughn, she's very famous. She's very famous that she, she used to date tiger woods that made her famous too. Plus she's hot. That makes her famous. It's peekaboo. Straight Shit. Interesting names. So like her, she's a gold medal winner, I believe. How many other ones out of there? There's a few. I mean there's like a handful. They can build a story around someone, then they can tell the story. But when you get to the point where it's worthwhile to sacrifice your entire life and it actually pays off, what are the, what are the odds? It's so fucking small, but meanwhile people are tuning in to all of it.

Speaker 1:          02:28          They're making massive amounts of revenue from all of it and they're not sharing it with the athletes at all. I think it's fucking gross. They pretend it's amateur. Different tenants and amateur. It's a Goddamn motherfucking business. That's what the Olympics are. Well, there's considerable college business. You can't basketball and football. Really? NCAA says student athletes shouldn't be paid because the 13th amendment allows unpaid prison labor. What the fuck? Oh, that's Shaun King. This is breaking up. This is a, this is another article. This was the main one going around, but there's uh, uh, that's crazy. Did they really say that? Did they really say that? The 13th amendment, which allows unpaid prison labor decided in a lawsuit, a response to a motion to dismiss and they, that's what they use is so disgusting. They're so disgusting. They're the same to me. Ncaa College football and basketball, same thing to me.

Speaker 1:          03:21          They have 180 of those thousand people. Yeah, fuck you pay those guys, pay him, pay those girls, pay all those athletes. You're making money, you're making money and you're not sharing it with the athletes. They might as well be slaves. They might as well be fucking prisoners, the Olympics, Ncaa, all that shit. It's just these no way. There's no way you could do that fresh today. Have you started from scratch today and said, we're going to get make billions of dollars and we're going to give you boom. Got It. Gotcha. Cool. There was no way you could never do education. Imagine they did that with the Olympics today. They said, look, we're going to spend billions of dollars in the athletes. What are they going to pay? Oh, we're not going to pay them shit. They don't get anything. You remember just to be making any money. You're fucked. You're out.

Speaker 1:          04:06          It used to be that you made money, you're out, but now they let basketball players play in the Olympics. They like the NBA players because of, I think it was Russia was getting close and beat and they beat us once. [inaudible] 72 I think. Oh, is that what it was? They started thinking about it. Then when we got, they were catching up. The European players were catching up. They go, fuck this. We're going to send over our brothers. NBC Sports is about to make one point $4 billion in 22 days thanks to the super bowl and the winter Olympics. Okay. The Superbowl, at least his professional athletes, I guess they get paid, they get paid and whether they get paid enough is up for debate. I get that, but the Olympics, they're not getting paid dick and it's fucking gross and it makes me angry and it's one of the reasons why I don't watch the Olympics. I get mad at it. You know, I wanted to be in the Olympics at one point in time, but to fight, I wanted to be in taekwondo was being introduced the Olympics in 1988 I tried out for the national team. I got it to like the quarter finals in Miami. I won three fights and it was, um, that was the last, like my last, uh, my really last fascination with taekwondo. I'd kind of given up on taekwondo really before it.

Speaker 1:          05:29          Okay.
