Speaker 1:          00:00          You can say something ridiculous and then say feminist theory and they're like, oh, it's in feminist theory. Yeah, yeah. That's the thing, right? It's so much of the stuff they come up with. Let me throw him on olive branch. Like so much of the stuff they come up with is a creative idea. Maybe there's something to some of this stuff, right? But what they're putting forward is hypotheses and then they're treating them as conclusions so they're putting forward this idea. I saw one on Twitter today, it was something like there's about South Park, how it's been laundering racism into society and making everybody comfortable with racism. And that's why everything's so racist and people are shooting Jews is because southpark made it normal that they're treating that as a conclusion. But that's a hypothesis, right? So we could test that. It's conceivable that you could actually try to parse out what variables need to be controlled.

Speaker 1:          00:42          C, you know, South Park came out and started doing these themes. What? How does it track? Statisticians can do kind of amazing things with that stuff, but they're not doing that. They're not testing it and send it, testing it. They're concluding it and they're using theory to do so and they're like, oh no, it's even bigger than that because why don't they test it? Well, if they tested it, and this is, I'm not making this shit up, you won't believe me, but this is true. If they tested it and the test showed that their hypothesis was wrong, they would say that the test was racist, but the test is condoning racism and that's why it didn't give them the desired result. How would you test something like, cause I mean I'm not a statistician. I actually am a mathematician, but I'm not a statistician. They're two different things.

Speaker 1:          01:20          So I'm not exactly sure how you would test that. But conceivably you could gather data, survey data and see how attitudes have changed. Maybe you could track kinds of articles, kinds of events that are coming out. You could kind of pair that up with what's been shown on south park who aren't self park and track out with attitudes. I mean there's no effort to do this. They're like, oh, South Park presents these ideas, which they then cherry pick. Cause there's other ideas that they don't talk about their, you know, point the other direction. These ideas are problematic. That's the big word. Theoretically that's a problem. Why? Because they, and I'm not joking, they literally believe that use of language creates the power dynamics that defined society. So South Park's using language and imagery that creates a power dynamic that makes people more comfortable being racist. Boom. It's theory done. No tests needed. No even attempt to test. And then if the test happened, the test itself would be racist unless it confirmed the hypothesis. Right.
