Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. Oh yeah, a lot. Of course. Edge it bra. Also known as Eddie Bravo. It's your pride. That's what they taught when we were in Brazil. That's the calling me. Hey is Joe Moran? Were those the first giant tournament that there was an la Joe Moran was, he was the main promoter and in my division that was 45 guys were all blue belts in my division. He's, and you got to sit there and listen to him. Call out everyone's name and I'm sitting there. I'm waiting for him to call. My name is, he looks, he looks at the clipboard. Then he looks up because here's your bra.

Speaker 1:          00:34          I'm standing right in front of him. I'm like, man, when are they going to call my dad? Like fuck. And then someone say, dude, I think he's saying you're in hand. No Way. Yeah. Where's Rick Story? Ben? It's a long story. I [inaudible] out of the park. It was the weed dive in that ball landed in the bed of my cup and he probably just went to Pete's. Fantastic. He gets so worked up. I was hoping you'd jump over here and choke the shit out. He loves conspiracy theories about nine 11 inside. Y'All are, I don't know man. Don't answer that. You're already smart. Get Eddie another beer down real quick.

Speaker 1:          01:33          Real quick. Chemtrails yesterday, a killer or an aid? How many, how many towers went down on nine 11. Oh my God. I know. He knows my brothers crazy like you are. Oh Shit. Donald Cerrone's that happy. He knows the three towers went down. Means that, uh, you know, most people don't know. They'll say to most people don't know when that a press conference with Nist, the National Institute of Standards and technologies, they're the ones that came out and explained what happened. Tower some when they asked him why didn't, did you guys check for a really simple, it's like kindergarten shit when they asked the head of kindergarten, why didn't you check for explosives? Why didn't you test for explosives on tower seven? They said there was no reason to witnesses. Meanwhile, there's about an hour of witnesses, firemen, policemen, sane bombs went off. There's video of what's going on and the guy said, we didn't check for bombs because there was no witness. What about that frowning? Who flew those planes? Exactly.

Speaker 1:          02:46          Nothing. Anybody can say. I can say to you, there's nothing I can say. I provide a complete video evidence for you. I broke it down for you. You're still saying how much I can say to me. I hadn't said anything. Let me play devil's advocate momentarily. Some guy asked me the other day if I wanted to have someone who's a lot, a flat earth proponent is apparently the best argue or for a flat or I want to hear that argument. What could they possibly say? No fucking way. Either trolling or retard. Yes, of course it's Trump, but the one thing that's fucking weird is you would think with all the satellites we have going in and out of our solar system and how come there's no pictures of the earth and like, Hey, I don't know. It's a fact. I'm Brian Cord. Meyer was one of the top CIA guys back then.

Speaker 1:          03:54          JFK. This was Kay was banging cored wires wife. So when you listen to this, he Howard hunt concessional. He said Lyndon B Johnson work a straight at the whole thing. He lives. He's telling you a CIA agent famous on his deathbed saying, you look at wait was cord Meyer cord. Meyer wanted him dead, so Lyndon B Johnson, he had cord. Meyer did look how much at the time was that? He Bravo spent smoking weed, peering out curtain senior first play that. Are you shocked or something? Dude. Now people are dying all the time. Did you know this is some wide open? She did. You know how many astronauts died in 1968 to eight and then two more in 69 what happened when they doing flying in this space? Accidents. His Father Prescott Bush started the CIA. His father, Prescott Bush finance the Nazis through union bank. That's not a conspiracy theory that you know in Sweden for many years they sterilize kids that didn't have symmetric, perfectly symmetrical faces.

Speaker 1:          04:59          Is that a fact? It's actually nice. That's why they're so good looking because they stay. I don't know. I'll look into it. You think you think that's crazy? When, when? When when you say look into it, did you look into it? I got to meet her now. Everything that's coming through the major news that works all have an agenda behind it. Whether it's district, because if I was running shit I would, if I was running shit and they said, hey, what do you think we should do? I'm like, wait a minute. Are you guys controlling the media? First of all, if they say no, we're not really controlling the media. They do whatever they want. I would say control the goddamn media. What the fuck are you guys, how would I get my information at the library guys? I go to the library as apple bottom.

Speaker 1:          05:41          I'm so fucking Internet. Who goes to the library? The library. You guys get your information from the Internet. I go to the library. How I love how you say the Internet is if it's all the same source he did. He was in this amazing documentary and just a fucking changing documentary called the principal. Have you seen that? No, I have not. Fuck Emmett Chicago's in at a bunch of physicists, like professors from Mit. That's so funny. I just saw the documentary sugarcoated, Dan. Have you seen it? It's terrifying. Holy Shit. Real quick documentary. This is, this is one that I've watched over and over. It's really, really good. You said it's the festival. No, it's not. It's not, but it's really, really good because especially for conspiracy, there is type, it's called how big oil conquered the world. There's a documentary called the fence will blow your fucking mind. They never finished that. They abandoned it. It's deserted. Mexican dudes are going, what are these Americans doing? They're interviewing Mexicans. I'm just like, this is easy. This documentary's called about the birth of oil and how it came in and infected all our lives and how John Rockefeller monopolize fucking everything to find that dude. It's an incredibly, and it's free on youtube. Yeah. That's a big red flag there. Hey, there's a documentary you can watch on Youtube. Oh, Jay, the untold story.

Speaker 1:          07:00          Untold Story. Oh No, it's at the library, Bro. In America. The Sugar Association, they didn't want it to be labeled as for what it really was, uh, uh, an addictive toxin. They wanted to keep it. It ain't that bad in moderation and ain't that bad. It makes things taste sweet. It's about love. They tell you, they tell you lead on no shit. We're looking at a bunch of lights and the Goddamn sky. You're going to tell me that that light and that light that's 200 and 5,000 trillion light years away. How the fuck did you figure that out? And you don't have an explanation for that shit. No, exactly. That's what every would you just send it right now? But what you just said now is what everyone's natural reaction. Cause anytime someone says anything about space, you automatically think someone figured it out. You don't know the guy's name.

Speaker 1:          07:55          You don't know the name of the experiment. You didn't look into it yourself. You just think when someone tells you how far is the earth from the sun? Oh say oh 93 million miles away. Like you just, you. Everybody relies on someone figured that out and someone double checked it. Dude, it's math. It's science. It's math. But no one really knows. So they, they paid according to this documentary, they paid out Harvey. You know, cause everyone's like, I'm science, I'm a science. This, I'm science that it's beautiful when people do that because then all you do is buy off all the scientists and you got everybody. I love some sugar though, man. We can all be bullshit. Those documentaries key so juiced up. They're so, they're so juicy. They seem so good. They seem so real. You get fired up and then once you get fired up, it's tough to get unfired up.

Speaker 1:          08:44          I want to be in the Goddamn Illuminati. If they'd got down and listening. Yeah, that's the wrong, except the military credit for all the great music that came out of the 60s you fucking military scenario. You are a fucking just shit to start my own false flowers. Jones, he's get a call you a shell Monday morning we got an disturbing turn of events. Eddie Bravo I've had on this podcast. I did not know he was in an Illuminati Shit. Fuck yeah, he is on the Joe Rogan experience. Yes. Yeah. Trails proven to be false. Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah. I want to fucking, oh my God, you're in. If, oh, please let me, let me work through my own fault. I talked about this, the phone, I would, if I would get that fucking oil from Alaska, I would go in there and make it, make it an elect. Trump make it look like the Isis is, uh, uh, Eskimos are trained in Isis. I would, you know, you're a national treasure and [inaudible] was a national trend. Now these things are true. It has to be frustrating. Ready to believe something go. He's constantly have to back. Here's a sauce and this is very exhausted. When I posted a meme, I can see like people, I could see my, uh, followers rise. But what I post, anything like anti vaccine, any kind of dude, hundreds, 70, 2000.8 and then it goes, well, it's 7.6 reach to, they want, people don't like conspiracy. I know so many.

Speaker 1:          10:30          I lost. You know what? I cleaned them out. It's a filter. I needed to clean those fuckers out. Someone did come up to me and say, Hey, have you heard that conspiracy theory where there's no forests, there's a conspiracy theory where there's no chorus. Look into it. No forest, you love these things. I'm like, I don't know what that is. Really. I didn't even look, I watched 30 seconds cause someone that had an in class told me, right. A Ziggy came across your, that conspiracy theory about Noah. I go, Whoa, what is that? When all of that, but no forest, and I was 13 seconds. I used to stopped it. Have you seen the one with this? The due to the dinosaurs aren't real. Have you seen that one that I don't have? I don't know. I don't know. That's like some other shit where I'm like, I don't, I don't believe any science. I don't believe in the only science. I believe that is a, you rub two sticks together and there's fire that's other than that science, you've got to prove that. It's just like a boy scout. I'm going to ignore that shit. Hmm. Oh, you gotta just tobacco science. What about that, that you think that Shit gone?

Speaker 2:          11:44          Yeah.
