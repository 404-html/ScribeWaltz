Speaker 1:          00:00          But this is the thought process behind it and there's no pushback because the public speaks and then I pushed back in the attack me and they attack you bring it on, bring it on because ignorance bounces off me like personal hygiene from Michael Moore. It just has no impact whatsoever. I think he washes. You don't think I have a shame like a more, you know what a what a swine. He is as a subhuman Mongrel. If I borrow, when I met him, he was in his car. He's a prick. He's a liar. What do you think he's like scam artists like gun control. Well, how about the fact that he put together that move, that so called documentary that Hollywood actually give him an award and he copied and pasted out of sequence the attack on the grid. Charlton Heston claiming he was somehow responsible for the little child killing herself with you're paroled felon father's gun and they put it out of sequence and attributed Charlton Heston defending such irresponsible gun ownership.

Speaker 1:          00:54          Michael Moore is a line, cruel, stoned punk cause he's don't constantly all day all the time. I think he uses depositories. I don't know him. I do and I, he's a punk. Have you ever had a conversation? Yeah. Yeah. I was on his TV show and I was responsible for ending his TV show cause he tried to fuck with me. And I don't know if you'd noticed Joe, but I'm unfuckable you fuck with me. I'll eat your family tree and shit. Saw dust into your face. Ask Pierce Morgan. That seems like I saw your compensation. Not even close. I was arm wrestling a torso. Well the Pierce Morgan, the problem is he didn't understand the facts. When you talk about gun violence, he didn't understand that. How much of a guy he knew them he avoided. Absolutely. Plus he explain what we're talking about because when you say the numbers of gun violence, the a giant percentage of 'em are suicide.

Speaker 1:          01:45          A giant percentage of them are cops killing bad guys and citizens defending their family. So all of those are out of the, and then accidental gun deaths, mass summarize it for you. So Pierce Morgan fancies himself a conky rather witty limeys you got the accent and everything. It's funny that actually an accent, it's an impediment. But, uh, he came out and of course he's going to take on the motor city madman. I mean this guy is going to be easy. Pickins he actually wrote Wango tango be all intellectually this thing you're doing. That's the Limey Eve God manufactured confidence based on nothing except an ego that has no foundation in fact. So Pierce Morgan, the CNN exec. So, but it's put Pierce Morgan on the Motor City Madman. This will be in a gun store to at the first time you didn't see the first one at the CNN officers. That's the best.

Speaker 1:          02:38          Both of them. Yeah, that's the best one. And so they think I'm a dirt bag and then a goof ball because I not only wrote Wang Dang sweet poon Tang, I meant it. Um, but when they take me on, they don't realize I never went to college because I was too busy learning shit. And if you take me on, on any subject that I am even slightly of, I will fuck you up because I've studied this stuff. I live this stuff. I've been with guns since I could walk. I have had universal unlimited access to firepower my whole life, both in a recreational, a disciplined, a law enforcement, military training, and just a family plinking competition. So when every considerable, uh, imaginable gun use, I've been 68 years of it. Um, so they sick Pierce Morgan Ami to teach me a lesson about how irresponsible gun owners are and that if we could just band guns, that all the violence would end.

Speaker 1:          03:44          And of course, uh, if you haven't seen it, you got to Google it because it was, what's his take? Well, I almost fixed him, um, because I, I so overwhelmed them with evidence that they finally research and realize that every word out of my mouth was absolutely indisputable. What was most compelling that you were saying to him? I'll summarize it as this way like I did to pierce the anti gunners have their dream. It exists. It existed in Paris where all those people were shot with collision kickoffs, collision concert band. They have their dream Pierce Morgans dream exists. It's called a gun free zone. Virginia Tech, Columbine, Sandy Hook, Aurora Parklin. Every instance where the most innocent lives have been slaughtered have been in Nancy Pelosi, Maxine waters, Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama's dream. Their dream is a gun free zone, but we're three people are forced, forced into unarmed helplessness where the most innocent lives are lost and that dream has produced more carnage and destroyed lives than anything in the world compared to the NRA convention where you have the highest incidence of gun ownership or opening day of deer season in Michigan where you have 100% gun ownership and access where nobody gets hurt.

Speaker 1:          05:11          So if you know that your dream is a gun free zone and that's where the most innocent lives are lost, what kind of demonic dirt bag would actually want more? Well, let me stop gun Fritz and I stopped his position or anybody's position on the other side. You would say the real gun free zone would be no one having access to the gun that killed those people in the gun free zone. It's not a gun free zone. And the real, and the real answer to drownings in America would be to ban water fuels. You work on banning water, I'll work on banning guns and we'll touch base every few weeks and see how you can not ban. You cannot eliminate guns. Finland, you can not eliminate guns. Uh, Alberta Canada where the guy who came into the University of shot everybody up. It's so what you do instead of thinking you could ban water, learn to swim and watch your children by the pool.

Speaker 1:          06:06          Call me weird. But the way to handle violence is to carry a gun practice with it. And when someone brings lethal force against you, shoot the mother fucker. But people are very uncomfortable with the idea of an incredibly armed society. Comfortable babies. Sorry, you're uncomfortable and go ahead and bend over and die. But you know what I'm saying? Fuck, I know what you're saying. But wouldn't it be better if there weren't any concern that the, the idea is to somehow or another takeaway, the concern of people being shot randomly by some psycho that you've got to figure out if you get all the guns away, how do you get all the guns? We don't know. I don't know. But this is what I'm saying is that you don't know, so let's just start. If they're not try, if it's not that, then everybody's got guns to shoot.

Speaker 1:          06:48          Nobody. Everybody will not have guns and some people have guns. People here. I studied San Bernardino. I started to roar. I started at Virginia Tech. I studied Columbine. I studied sandy hook. I studied them all. Do you know Joe and everybody better write this down because I'm the only guy that will tell you this. I've studied the cadence, the bullet manufacturers, the rate of fire, the movement of the Perp and the movement of the victims in every instance, including in Connecticut, including Aurora, including San Bernardino, right here, there were American citizens who would have had a gun on their person if they were allowed to and they could have been a meaningful force to at least reduce, if not terminate the violent, murderous threat. But by law we have been so dumbed down and so forced against our natural survival instinct to have a tool on our belt that in every instance where the most innocent lives were slaughtered, those people that would have intervened with a firearm, not many of them, but there was a janitor, there was a couple of guys in the office they add, can see a weapons permit, but they weren't allowed to have Monette building in Virginia Tech.

Speaker 1:          08:07          There were guys that had guns, concealed weapons permits, but they weren't allowed to have them there in Aurora, Colorado. Are you kidding me? All kinds of people would have had guns and they could have returned fire, but they were forced into unarmed helplessness. Here, here's the gun debate in its con irrefutable conclusion. If you are forced into unarmed helplessness, you are unarmed and helpless. What a horrible, irresponsible, suicidal condition that Ian, I'm just a guitar player. Joe. I've never been unarmed since I graduated from high school. I've always had a Hanky in a pocket full of guitar picks and a pocket knife and a belt knife and uh, built tool and a pistol. And some extra bullets. I just have them everywhere I go. I've never been on armed. I find it. How do you travel around? I improvise, adapt, and overcome. I luckily I helped pass house resolution to 18, which means all sworn law enforcement officer allowed to carry a gun nationwide.

Speaker 1:          09:12          I've been sheriff deputy since 1984 in my credentials. Allow me to carry a gun everywhere I go and I carry a gun everywhere he goes. In fact, even in England, uh, American law enforcement are allowed to carry guns and I carry gun over there. It's just a tool. If somebody comes at me, carry a gun in England. Yeah, eat some dirt bag comes at me with a spiking the, I've just shoot him. But why not? What's plan B? No, I, I agreed that I've just had to be hard to have it and not to need it than to need it and not to happen. Go. The thing that we would all like to have is no school shootings, no mass shootings. Noah roar a no. Columbine. No. So how do you stop that? Do you think you stopped that with more guns when you think you stopped that with mental health education, figuring out how to get people off of pills, figuring out how to keep people from living despondent lives where they want to just tear it all down and shoot everybody in her hurt a bunch of people.

Speaker 1:          10:09          Well, here we are. That's the route, right? Sure. Here we are, 2018 so we can't go back in history in find the goofball from Virginia Tech and what motivated him? We can't go back there because we have failed as a society to take care of people or respond with any sense of responsibility or effectiveness to the glaring dangerous sides. Most outrageously in Parkland where the guy called the cops 42 times, called the FBI three times that guys are going to shoot up the school. Okay, we'll make a note of that. No, the guy's going to shoot up the school. Okay. We'll make a note of that. The guy is bringing a gun to school to shoot people. Here's his manifesto. Uh, we've made a note of that, but are you kidding me? So now if we go for them to do something and when someone does something, no, it's not.

Speaker 1:          11:01          No, no, it's not. I don't think it's a failure of law enforcement. I had, what's the matter? It's just a shooting two hours ago. Oh Jesus Christ. Another one, five people are dead and multiple people are wearing apolis Melik Maryland at a Oh Maryland where no one's allowed to have a gun, by the way, Marilyn to a newsroom and shot a bunch of reporters. How much Jesus, how much you wanna bet it was a gun free zone. Annapolis newsroom shooting leaves. Five people dead suspect in custody. A newsroom. Yeah. Well, what's my point? So I made a news room and I'm ready to rock. I'd rather be sitting where you are, but I get figure you've got me covered. My point is, is that the cat is, is already out of the bag, right? It's not too late. Columbine guys, glaring signals, red alarms going off over at Virginia Tech Guy, red alarms going off for years and Columbine thing is a difficult one because it really hadn't happened before that no one expected it.

Speaker 1:          11:58          But to parents walked through the garage for three years. We're the bomb making materials were I'm the table. Yeah. They weren't the best parents guys were like zombies. These guys were like doper freaks from buns. I just Zulu land maniacs. Well, he's just, he's just different. No, he's not. He's freaky. We need to sit down with this guy and get him some help. The Aurora guy told his psychiatrist, my goal is to shoot as many people as possible in the psychiatrist. Didn't say anything really or it's on record. He said it in numerous visits with his psychiatrist that he had threatened his golden life was to kill as many people as possible and he's now got his new ar 15 to do it with and the psychiatrist didn't say anything. I've studied this stuff. We need to not only see something, say something, we're missing the part.

Speaker 1:          12:47          The final part do something when this kind of abberant threatening violent red alarm behaviors going off. Inter veen sit down with this kid at the first instance when your kid comes home all glassy eyed and goofy and incommunicable and in showing weird signs like the Sandy Hook Guy did all his life and the Aurora guy did all his life and the Parkland guys Zombie, you know, staring like uh, wouldn't blink in a sandstorm. Somebody got, I know I would, I mean in my life, whether it's musicians or family members are going, are you going to write? What is it going on? You look like you're going to shit yourself, man. Are you okay? What do you do with that conversation with somebody like the psychiatrist did to the Aurora shooter does mean, how do you fix these people? I mean, what you're saying is if you have no gun free zones and people are allowed to have guns, at least they'll have an ability to defend themselves.

Speaker 1:          13:41          I agree with you. I agree with you on that, but how do you stop it from happening in the first place? The anti gun people say the way to stop it is to have no guns available to civilians that can do things virtually impossible. A virtual pasta. So what we're dealing with is just pragmatically, when you look at 300 million people and probably 400 million gun, where you haven't counted mine yet. I mean, how many guns? Yeah. For every guy like you that has hundreds of guns, you know, I am almost, everybody I know has hundreds of guns and he just like a man, I got hundreds of arrows. I have four, I have dozens of guitars.
