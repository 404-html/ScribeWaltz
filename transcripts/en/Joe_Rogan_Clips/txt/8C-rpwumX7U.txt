Speaker 1:          00:00          Now, worse part is the Old New York speaking of, of the people who are older people are retiring. They can't stay in New York state because it's too expensive, too expensive. So they pack up and go to a North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida. Is it taxes, real estates? Both its taxes and it's an opportunity. It's both of those two things, right? So it's so, so they decided to head on down in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Tennessee. They actually have a name for us in the Carolinas. They call us halfbacks. We went to Florida and halfway back. That's true. They calls halfbacks. That's how many New Yorkers go there. But he's the worst part. Go to Florida. Go, ah, this is a mistake. There we go. Say, well the sad part here is though, Florida actually has more people than we have and half of our budget and, and Scott actually the governor Scott actually thanked Cuomo for sending all the people down there because 15% of New York state's budget is actually pensions.

Speaker 1:          00:48          And so many people who are pensions are actually leaving New York state and going someplace else. So New York state, people are paying for the pensions and then they're being spent in other states. It's a terrible idea. We, the state is broken. It is so broken and people are talking about if you're Democrat, you're saying everything's still great. If you're Republican, you're saying, well tweak this or tweak that. I'm saying rebuild from scratch. There are things you have to change. You have to change the route so you can make the branch is actually died. We keep clipping branches, the weeds to keep growing. Now we got way off track with this um, school shooting thing. And I wanted to get back to it because I think it's a very complex issue and I need is, I don't know what the answer would be. I think there is no one in town, right?

Speaker 1:          01:31          I think you've found problems and these problems that you're willing to discuss it. Very few people are. Yep. Are these people are lonely and sad, but it's a public suicide and that they're on psychotropic drugs? Absolutely. And I don't know why you don't think that other people want to fix it. I just don't think that they have a solution that they can discuss that is not so controversial that it overwhelms the rest of their messages. What could be done? Sure. I have a couple of answers. Okay. The issue is this is an issue that's been going on literally for decades, so there is no do this and it's done. Right? Right. There are several things. One of them is fixing education. The other one is fixing family courts is said two things. You can start slow. We'll show how do you fix education? Absolutely. It is a complete reboot right now.

Speaker 1:          02:15          The first thing you gonna do with education is you want to make sure there is no standardized testing until high school. None whatsoever. Santa's nice testing is bad for several reasons. Number one, it's an unfair way of getting teachers right teachers and are graded by how their students do on a standardized test, which is silly. That doesn't mean you're a good or a bad teacher. Next, it makes a bunch of kids who are 10 11 1213 years old feel stupid because they're not good test takers and you create. Now a secondary class of student for absolutely no reason because the next reason is standardized testing is no indication of success in life. You could be a great test taker at 12 or 13 or terrible test taker and it does not mean you'll be successful or not successful in life. Last is how New York state, often we'll decide how to fund schools, so it's a way of funding schools.

Speaker 1:          02:56          That's also unfair. There's no advantage to standardized testing except it meet means the federal government now begins to control our schools more. So when you say the standardized testing has an, there's an effect on funding, does that mean that if a school does really well, they get more money? Yup. Often it's part of a, a very complex algorithm that New York state has that almost no one can actually find. That seems like it should almost be the opposite, that if a school does poorly that they should put more resources into that school because it's not being effective in theory. That's true. I'm not sure that's accurate either. We, we throw about $22,000 per student per year in New York state more even in California and it doesn't work. We have mediocre results at best dollars isn't the answer. It's revamping the system. Right? Funding is not the answer.

Speaker 1:          03:37          So how do you revamp the system? There's more parts of that. First one was just covering of that. The second thing is we shouldn't even have k through 12 k through 12 was an anachronism and shouldn't exist because the last two years she be k through 10 the last two years of high school for a huge chunk of people, Jim, study hall, Video Games and probably smoking weed, just nothing but bad foot. Too many students just sitting around doing nothing. They have no purpose. They had no community. They have, they had no, no reason to do anything. They're unhappy. Right? Another reason why they're unhappy. It's not a gross generalization that they're unhappy and an unknown thing and you just probably a lot of kids listening to this that are 16 and 17 they're working their ass off right now and I have a passion for that future and I have a solution for them.

Speaker 1:          04:23          That's even better. I have a solution. Again, your limits that's going to keep moving. Okay, go ahead. Right. First thing is how do I know what I just said is true, right? You just asked that question. I'll tell you why. What I just said, why no, it's true because for the vast majority of students going to college now, the First Year of college is 13th grade because they're not ready for school because the last two years didn't prepare them for college. If it did, we wouldn't require it. 13th grade, I don't know how to say 10th grade. The average student now take six years to graduate college, so the results show me that I'm correct, right? The results of what's happening and here's the worst part. Now we shipped these kids off to college who many of them don't even want to go to college.

Speaker 1:          04:59          So we sent him anyway. It takes them six years to graduate. The 24 years old with at least 50 k in debt, if not more, minimum for decay, some a hundred k something, 200 k depending what it is. And now there's no job for what they want to do and now they're working at Starbucks. Wow. What a disaster that is. We wonder why our kids coming back home. So how about this, since that at 10th grade took a test, you pass the test, you get diploma. Whether you were home, school, private school, Public School is yours. Awesome. Now you have five choices and this is exactly to your point. You have five choices. Choice number one, you're a kid who's hardcore. You think that college is your answer? Good. Go to to your prep school. Imagine that kid who right now he just had is busting his ass.

Speaker 1:          05:38          He could be in as in a prep school of his choice. And, and the people in that prep school are all kids who want to be in that prep school. It would change his entire situation, no more knucklehead who don't want to be there, who are forced to be there, who are cutting class. The kids who would be there are those who want to be there. The teachers and in this planet, no disciplinary issues. They kids who want to be there better for them. They could hustle better. Now they're ready for college. When they get there, they take advantage of incubators of, of internships. Maybe even graduating three years now. The Rock and roll them less debt. Better off life is good. Better services, better everything for less money. I'm not done. You're not that kid. You're the kid who is super smart human. Become a scientist.

Speaker 1:          06:18          You want to be, get a phd. Awesome. Go right to an associate's degree. Start right away. 16, 17, 18, continue to agree because you're that good. Take your sats. You're that smart. You're Einstein. Awesome. Go do that. Not, you know, want any of those things? No worries. Cool to it's school. Uh, become a plumber or a carpenter, Mason, whatever the case, let me go do it. New York state desperately needs tradesmen desperately. The average trade's person in New York states about 50 years old. Too old for an average should be 30 something for an average 35 and before an average, it's too high, which means we have a lot of trades jobs that are not filled. I mean a lot of foreign labor, it has to come to New York state, right? New York, your kids aren't doing it. Why we've been told a lie and that lie is the only way to success.

Speaker 1:          06:59          The only way is to do well in high school. Get a great for you degree and go get a job and sit behind a computer all day. That's a lie. That is a way to success. It is not the only way to success. There are a lot of kids now, and I'm sure you know people like this who they spent the first five, 10 years of their life trying to make it that way, struggling through school. Then at 28 years old, they go, I just want to build houses, man. Then they go build the house or that's what makes us so to be a computer guy and they just make apps. He's gonna do something, want to do. They should have been doing that at 18 well, I'm still not done. Most people though, they don't know what they want to do. This is a big part of it.

Speaker 1:          07:33          I get the whole time, don't have a passion. They don't have a direction and they're confused. Yes. I, this is one of my biggest complaints I got about this plan, right? Because then the two ideas are because he'll get a job, right. Just go work or sort of business and what you just said. That's why I get all the time. But Larry, they're 16 they're not. They're doing good. Make Your mistake at 16 not 26 we're making mistakes at 26 and we have people who are lost at 26 we have a generation now. If you ask the people in their twenties right now across this across this nation, and you say, do you feel like an adult over half will say no, have have you say no 40 year olds also though? Not as much, but yes, but not as much though. It probably would be over half.

Speaker 1:          08:11          It won't be over half. Okay. You go to your 20 somethings over half will say no, I don't feel like an adult. Right, because they're making the same mistakes that many people May, 1819 16 they're not making a 25 26 28 it's also not a rights of passage things though thing that actually happens. This would actually be that. They'd have to make that choice at 16 but here's the issue. How do I pay for it and it covers the entire sheet that we just talking about. That's the next question I get. How you paid for it. New York state says, I have to pay for full 12 years of school. Have to pay for it, stay next, pay for it. No worries. I was a marine when I got the Marine Corps. I got a Gi bill x dollars, I think it was $100,000. I forgot what it was back then.

Speaker 1:          08:48          This is in the 90s. Um, I think at $100,000, like 10 years to use it, we're going to give all of our kids $20,000 and five years to use it. They don't get the physical check, but the state will pay a check to whatever school they want to go to for $20,000. They have five years to use it. Where does that mean? You can at 16? So experimenting. You can say, you know what? I know colleges for me, I'm gonna go to prep school. Here's what I promise you. I promise you this, the El, but any amount of money you want, I promise you this. As soon as this comes into play, you will find tons of all of a sudden prep schools and trade schools the pop up and guess how much they're going to cost for two years, $20,000 that's going to be a tuition.

Speaker 1:          09:24          You might say, well, wow. Laris a lot of money. It isn't. We're paying $44,000 now, if each of those kids, we're saving $24,000 per kid and giving them better schooling, more accurate actual choices, they can learn something. They make their mistakes at 1617 which is way better than 26 or 27 and maybe they figure what they want to do. Well, why is it so cheap? Why are you going to be able to do that for $20,000 when it costs so much more? Now? What's going to be different? The people who can be choosing, right? Yeah, so the people that are educating these people, how are they going to get paid? Oh, and where's the money gonna come from? Great question. Now, a couple things. Remember teachers ask me all the time, they say, Larry, how are you going to help us? Here's what I tell you.

Speaker 1:          10:05          I'm going to get rid of a bunch of your administrators in New York state. We actually have school districts that have more administrators than teachers. Why? Yes, that's correct. Do you own home? What's the value of having administrators? Because you have to check boxes for government. You have to check boxes for coming. Did you do x that you do? Why did you do z? These administers required, that's what's going on. That's correct. There's, there's about $60 billion in our budget in New York state for education, give or take about 4 billion comes from the federal government. About 35 billion comes from the state and about 20 billion comes locally. Give or take it a d. These are round numbers and they change yearly depending on, on, on who you talked about. It's about that. Once we get rid of the federal government, being involved in, in the, uh, in New York state for being dollars goes away.

Speaker 1:          10:47          People get afraid. Oh my God, we lose that money. Good, good. Let it go away because all of the administrators go away. Also, if you can get rid of three, four, five, six administrators for every one or two teachers, oh my God, I'm not good. You national educator. But I would imagine that if I was, uh, I would be upset at this. I would say that there's a reason why those administrators are there and we need them to take some of the administrative weight off of the teachers. The teachers are stressed out enough by teaching students. They don't have the time to be taken care of. All the formalities and the things that these administrators too. Um, I have never heard that ever because that's not true. You're the first person that ever said to me ever in over a year of me doing this.

Speaker 1:          11:25          So, and the reason is, or what are those administered with you? No, no, no, no. Not every teacher. I never heard it. You never heard it. I'm not just talking to a lot of, lots of them. Doesn't absolve them. Does, what did they say about administrating? They say awesome. It's not in those words, but yes, because most of the administrators are actually administrating teachers. The teacher telling them how to teach, what to teach, when to teach, grading them. They don't. Who Will the parents? Well, the parents will. Yes. You think the parents have the time or the of what an education should comprise of to be able to direct not just their, their student, what their child needs, but you know, a group of 50 or however large. The classic question and generally speaking, probably not, but teachers do. Teachers too. Yes, they're going to self police.

Speaker 1:          12:12          There'll be some administrators. You're, you're assuming that I'm going to get rid of all administrators. No, no I'm not. I'm not saying that. I'm saying, but you're definitely saying that you went to school with a, hold on, you went to school. Do you remember how many vice principals that were any of your schools you remember? No, I don't. Probably two or three. That was normal. It met most schools when I was his goal. Often it was two or three. I don't remember. Now there's 1212 ten four two. Why? Why is that? Because their administrators and they're making sure other things, they're making sure boxes are checked. So here's your alternative. You're alternative is keep funding a broken system and be afraid, which is what you're saying. No, I'm not saying you're saying, you're saying teachers will be afraid because afraid. Yeah, because I afraid who educated our kids?

Speaker 1:          12:57          No, no. Overwhelmed. Overwhelmed. Okay. Fear of, of being overwhelmed. Not just, not just that, but also like having a mandate like having, Yup, a very strict, I'm with you. Curriculum. Yes. Teach these children and that is nothing but a bad thing. I'm going to give you real fast if you don't mind them. Me Give you a list of all the time. Centralized control has worked. Finished. Centralized control doesn't work in in education meaning what? In anything when a centralized control make things fun. Bet defined. Centralized control. A strict mandate from Albany, a strict mandate from DC. I'll, I'll ask you a question. I'm assuming you're old enough that you were in school at one point at 1980 or older. Oh yeah. Well before I was, yes. Prior to 1980 basically the department of education didn't really exist as it does now. It did exist, but it was basically as a repository for information.

Speaker 1:          13:49          It didn't really do anything. I didn't have any power since 1980 up again and have power do this and we'll give you money. Don't do this. We don't give you money. Here are your rules. Follow them. I'll be punished you that. That's what they are now. You learn to read and write. You learn to function in society, so to die somehow, every American part in 1981 to school, learn how to read and write, learn how to function in society. Somehow it worked. Do I trust the administrator or a teacher? I would rather trust the teacher. Now, does that mean it'd be no ministers? Of course, that there'll be a minister. Of course they will be. There'll be still principles and things of that sort of course, but the difference is an administrator cares about checking a box, check a box. Your citizens aren't better off because boxes are checked.

Speaker 1:          14:31          You said it's a better off because the students are getting better and and because the parents are happier. Right, but when you're saying boxes being checked, that means things being covered that they feel for a standardized test. Yes. You two said that they feel significance, correct? Yes. Well that's someone, I mean I would said, I don't know how curriculums are set up, but I would imagine that people get together and they decide that children need to have a certain amount of ability. Yup. With grammar, certain amount of understanding of mathematics. Yes, I agree. Yes. Who's going to do that? How about teachers and the local administrators? And how about the local PTA, which was so less administrators, not an elimination of administrator. I never said that. So I didn't say you did. But how we decide how many administrators are necessary and how many can you cut out?

Speaker 1:          15:14          How much money can you save? And this is even better. You know that you're going to love my libertarian ways on this one. Right now what happens is there is a convoluted way of deciding house. What a convoluted way. Oh, I thought you said come loaded. Did you hear that? It could be, but no, I don't think it alluded to compliment complimentary way. Like this is a new word and I don't think it should be used as that. Is that new? No, not convoluted. The other ones, yeah, I'm loaded. I was like, this is, boy, there's a fetish there somewhere. I'm sure there is. I just haven't heard of me there. See you. You're ready to go now. So there's a calm that a way of actually of funding these schools. I don't want that. I want to be very simple. I want a flat fee to come from the state here, district, depending on how many kids you have, here's your money.

Speaker 1:          15:59          What does that mean? Well, the reality of it is there are about, if I'm not mistaken, about 700 school districts in New York state. A lot. A lot. That's a lot. It is a lot. And so what happens now is there's your money. Most of them are going to make no changes because they're gonna be afraid. But it's like anything else. There'll be early adopters and early adopters are going to say, wait a minute. So the federal government isn't telling us do this. The state government isn't telling us to do that. So we can change some things here. So when you say here's your money, they're going to get less money than they're getting now. It depends. It depends on the school district. Some will, some won't there. It's not like you'll have less jobs there. They're going to have to decide whether or not they [inaudible]. You got it.

Speaker 1:          16:36          Exactly right. Yes. And you're saying, oh my God, that's scary. Some of our school districts will fail. Yes. But in New York state, they're all failing now, so why do I care? But the west trailers in mass right now, I'm okay. I don't want government to be what you always hear, which is, you know, elections have consequences. So I, when I now get to impose my will upon all of you, because I won. So what I say goes, I'm supposed to know everything, be everything, create boards and make things happen. I instead want to be the guy who when you have trouble, I can help. So as go districts begin to have trouble, I will without question, try to help them. Of course I wrote, but there's 700 that's correct. How would you have time to do that? I won't. Personally. I'll have people who would ever, right now there's already an infrastructure to handle that already.

Speaker 1:          17:25          I don't have to create a new one already exists, but right now it's just, it's making up reasons to punish people. I don't want it to make up reasons to punish people. I want instead to say, okay, this school district is lost. How do we help? I only have one string attached to the money. I give only one and that is transparency. As I told you before, I'm a business guy and here's what I know. This is an actual equation that works every single time. Very simple, simple equation, personal freedom plus transparency plus accountability equals innovation. If we do that, the other adoptees will come on. They will find great ways of making things work. They will get rid of some administrators, they will get rid of them. Teachers, they will hire new ones. They will decide which one should be given raises. That will happen.

Speaker 1:          18:05          Okay, please go ahead. Because what you're saying may work in the world of business because people have incentive to succeed in business and that accented IV is monetary success when you always monetary, but yes. Okay. Not always, but for the most part. Yep, sure. When you're talking about a school yet and you cut the funding for the school and say, hey, figure it out. You guys decide how many administrators you want to keep art. The administrators' essentially the bosses, aren't they the ones who are in control? I mean they're not going to get rid of their own jobs, so what are they going to do? You're going to pay the teachers last and they going to get an inferior teachers and is a great question. Ramp up their, their control of the, of the cash flow because they realize that there's less of it. It is, oh, it's a great question and here's the issue.

Speaker 1:          18:49          It's not going to happen overnight. It's not like I went in November. I go, great, all the money's gone to how it works. I went November. People know what the plan is. We start talking about it already. We start bringing parents on board. We said, coming up with plans already. The plans, it's like, it's like it's like any other organization. You're saying business and think, oh, it's works in military. This works in this works in business. It is matter what's in everything. We'll see your family. It doesn't matter if you knew that six months from now you were going to have a sniff decrease in your income, you would start to make change. Typically, if there was someone above you saying, hey Joe, you're going to have a decrease in your income. How do we make this work? What can we do? If someone's there to guide you and you already have infrastructure there, you'll begin to fix it.

Speaker 1:          19:32          My fear would be that they would have less teachers and they would have the larger classes. Totally possible administrators because they're in control. People don't like to give up control unless you're a minute control. Well, who's actually in control with the PTA? Right? The pantry. Dissociation can. You can have a lot PTA board decide. Boards would decide, but they would have to agree with you. Yes. They want to get rid of administrators and if they didn't universally, if they didn't universally across the board in this fails miserably and then classes get larger and then kids get less attention. Yup. And then the already Piss poor education system sinks further into the abyss and we have two choices. Number one, we can be afraid of that and stay a hostage to a terrible system that's not working as failing our kids and making us in happiness Jordan estate.

Speaker 1:          20:20          That's option one or option to do that and just watch over it. Right. Understanding that that could happen because those were the only two options. One other option, the other option is yes, funded more. Ooh, fuck the bad system. Boom. No. Why that? If you had a 10 what's, what's wrong with the system? What's go over that I just told you I don't know but no, but I mean in terms of like how much money are they making, right. And what would increasing that amount of money enhance. Okay. Two things. Remember the first thing is there's no way in the world that a governor should be deciding what every teacher makes. An estate. Okay, that's just philosophically wrong, so I'm never going to do that. That is simply philosophically wrong. It's against who I am. Centralize, centralize. Control was a bad idea. Localized control is always a better idea for so that's so that, that premise, I'm never going to even touch that.

Speaker 1:          21:16          What I'm trying to achieve here is to make change. I know that locally there will be people who do it right because that always happens. That's just how it works. You will see out of seven districts, some of it decide to, you know, get together and and and mix this together. Some will decide not to. Some will do different things. You'll see it happen. My point is this is a major overhaul. I get it right? Businesses that all the time, families do all the time. If you're able to watch it, I don't want to be the mother or the father, right? Democrats will be your mother. They would give you everything. Probably going to be a father and protect you from everything. I wonder, your brother, let me to got you love. You don't want to live with them, but you love him. And when you need a ride to the airport, he's there for you.

Speaker 1:          22:00          And with the firefighter, the guy who comes to help when you need me. Now you're saying, but Larry is good. This will fail. Yes. Some ways I want them saying, well, okay, some might fail. That's you're saying. I'm not even saying they might fail. What I'm saying is that you're going to put them in a compromised situation. Yes. You're going to give them less money and you're going to say figure it out. Yes, but not just see. You're assuming that it's just here's money. Good luck. No, here's less money. Yes, he has less money. Yes. I think you have too many administrators. Yup. And let's talk this out over a series of several months. When you talk to professionals and educators, do they agree that they have too many administrators? Oil wasted money? Yes. So far everything's your, I've met, they want, but they agree they do well with less money if they didn't have to miss as yes.

Speaker 1:          22:41          And how much less money are we talking about? I'm not sure to be fought with you. Not sure yet. There's someone show you that you feel like the way to fix the education system is the cut funding that would like for people like me who are on the outside, you hear that and you go, Ooh, I already feel like teachers are underappreciated and probably because of that unmotivated because you decided to say the answer is cut funding. It's not what I saw. No, no, no, no. This is what you were saying. Yup. Regardless of what you're saying. Yup. What I'm saying is currently, Yup. Even in California, forget about New York. Yup. I feel like teachers are underappreciated. I would agree with that and I feel like it's a noble profession that's incredibly valuable and the people should be able to make a decent living. Agreed.

Speaker 1:          23:23          I don't know how the solution to that is to give less money to the school. You're missing a very valuable, very important point. If you ask most teachers whether underappreciated, most of them, they're not going to say that people like you and I don't appreciate them, they're going to say, the system doesn't appreciate me, and that's why they're always fighting the system. Oklahoma, they fought the system. They're always fighting the system. What I'm saying is fix the system. The system is heavily controlled in many cases by the federal government. $4 billion worth. So we have to lose $4 billion unless we, unless we want to keep the federal government in our system, but you don't want that. Your fixes to let them figure it out. Get the federal government out. Hold on, let them figure it out with less money. I have to have to push back here.

Speaker 1:          24:06          Okay. You, you keep saying, let them figure it out as if I'm just gonna walk away and say, oh well good luck. I hope I'm going to go off and now you know, hang out in Puerto Rico for a while. No, I'm saying I'm going to facilitate it because you know what I do? I trust teachers more than trust administrators. I trust the local people that if I give them the right tools, they'll do the right thing, but more importantly they'll show others as also transparent. What's going to happen is they're going to figure out the right way to do what teachers should. Should School district one hire more Spanish teachers versus going to stick to? I don't know. I'm not supposed to know that, but they do and if they make a mistake then they'll fix it. And then other counties, yes, you. Are you talking about the teachers themselves or are you talking about these administrators who you want to eliminate?

Speaker 1:          24:48          I'm talking to you about the school boards. The school, the school boards are going to be the ones with, with the PTA, with, if we make this work the right way, it will be everyone talking together. It will be school boards talking to administrators, Toma teachers talk with parents. I don't want schools graded beat by standardized tests. We've been doing that for years and we have very, very unhappy people, unhappy students, unhappy parents. I want parents to be happier. I supposed to be happier and you might say, but then Larry, they won't learn certain things. Is that a horrible thing? I'd rather than be happy then learn AP chemistry. Yes. If that means one school nurse decides the AP Chemistry isn't that important in a school district, it's fine. Those kids will learn it in the prep school and some kids won't learn AP chemistry. If that makes your school district happy, I'm okay with that because it goes to the next level, which of course becomes kids with special needs.

Speaker 1:          25:44          You have a special needs kid. How do you make that kid happy? How do you decide whether that kid successful or not? The standardized testing doesn't work. What do you do? He said doing checkboxes. Does that work? Of course. That's why you literally have hundreds of of parents every single year suing New York state because they were unhappy with their kids getting services but not getting better. I want your kid getting better. You're assuming that because the federal government puts these standards in it that makes them good or bad. It doesn't. If anything, it makes them worse. If my kids, if my kids are happy, that's what I want. Happy New Yorkers means they stay in New York. Happy New Yorkers means they grow their businesses in New York. Keep the families in need. I get that, but saying happy and the saying that solution and the key to happiness is funding them less and getting rid of administering my the Democrat Joe, I'm the Democrat.

Speaker 1:          26:32          Yes you are. You ought so a democrat. How am I a democrat? You got, I mean the world's ending less funding means the world's anymore. A lot of people, they hear that you're going to take money away from school. The person who only hears that, if the person says all he's going to do is get rid of money from schools, that's, that person is never going to vote for me. That person is probably a democrat. That problem's person's going to go for Cuomo and that's fine. I'm not going to win everybody. I can't win everybody, but I'm going to change a system that is completely broken. If you say this, what you're talking about people talk about with the MTA also in New York City, the MTA, you got to keep funding the MTA. I'm not going to be hostage to a ship system, period. I don't care.

Speaker 1:          27:10          I'm not going to be hostage to a shit system. This is a terrible system that is failing New Yorkers. That is failing people in New York City when it comes to the MTA mass transit. I'm sorry. Yes. If those of you who are not in New York, it's a bad system. I'm not going to be a hostile because of fear. No. I will fight my jailer period and my yellow is a system that is broken that says if you, if you, you better give me more money, otherwise it'll happen. You better give me more money. Otherwise this will happen. No, no. I'm going to fix that system. I'm going to help facilitate fixing that system. I'm just going to let them go away. I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is I'm going to help facilitate that system and to do that we're gonna lose $4 billion and we'll get over that.

Speaker 1:          27:51          We'll fix that, we'll make it happen. We'll make it work so by and if you get more people into this state and this is the most important piece, you can raise money through other ways and just raising taxes on people and this is the most critical piece when we hear funding, and this is why I'm, I was teasing you and Kanya Democrat because we need to about funding. You're talking about more taxes. I'm not talking about that. If you get more people to stay in New York state, you raise your revenue without having to raise taxes on anybody, but if you raise your revenue, we're going to put more revenue into the school of course, to be more people in the schools. More reverent. Yes, absolutely. Your money and there'll be more people in the schools that more. Of course we would if we could re of course we would.

Speaker 1:          28:29          Of course, New York state has a $170 billion budget with about a four bay now deficit and $300 billion in debt, and the answer for every Democrat Republican is more funding. There's going to be nothing left. This state is going to go different. It's going to go, it's gonna, it's gonna go under in 10 years. How do you get more people to come to the store, right? First thing, we're having a really super cold cases and I talked about super cool education that'll get people to come back. Are you going to hire someone to create this super cool education system? Are you gonna let these teachers figured out on their own? If we hate teachers, build me a super cool education system so that we get more fun. I already have the, I already have the infrastructure for the super cool system. I just told you. I've already told you what the, what the instructor is.

Speaker 1:          29:10          Then the concept already a skeleton is already there. Okay. Now once I went in November, we begin to build it out and yes, it will be me and other people be clear. It's not like New York doesn't have enough. New York's doesn't have enough workers. We have tons of workers that we can absolutely use to make this happen. Tons of them that if I'm not mistaken, the New York state has the most by percentage, uh, government employees I think. And I think in the nation, I know we're the most unionized, but I think we're the most, uh, uh, government employees by percentage or you're going to move their jobs. Sure. Love it. Yes, let's do that. Love the idea. You're asking details that are simple to fix when the time comes and simple to fix. So you're going to take people out of what professions and move them into fixing.

Speaker 1:          29:52          I think I actually have decided for every person in New York state where they're going to do, I don't know. That's why I'm asking course not you. This is a, you're doing it like a show. Now. I'm not doing a show. You, you're a democrat. Look at you. You're a democrat. You are a democrat. I'm not, I'm giving, I'm just asking you a real clean questions here. You four times said you're going to take money away. Flicks. You are right. Yes. You've said like four times, right? Because you going on about these other things, which is what matters more than losing $4 billion from education. Right? But I just want to be clear about what you're saying about what the actual going to fix this system by creating a good skeleton off the bat that people are going to enjoy and like, and then once I went in November, we're going to fill that skeleton up to make an amazing school system that people can be proud of.

Speaker 1:          30:39          They're going to want to bring their people then to come back from North Carolina that had come back from Tennessee. They're going to move from, from Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. I'm going to be part of this system. They're going to see schools that actually work well. They're going to see prep schools get kids into college. They're going to see colleges and actually educate kids and get them into jobs. When they see that happen, they're all start coming. That's going to happen. It doesn't happen by me saying, how do I fund this? It doesn't happen by me saying, being afraid of making a step. You don't have to have the perfect plan to move forward. No plan is perfect anyway. You want a good solid plan with motivated people. If you have motivated people to take up a plan, it'll wind up being successful. Again, it's how it works.

Speaker 1:          31:19          So this grandiose plan is I like, you're going to get rid of the last two years of high school and you're going to offer potential prep school for children and you're going to, for other kids, offer them trade schools, schools. Sure. You're going to get rid of $4 billion in federal funding. You're going to let the schools figure out how many administrators they should have with help with help, with help, and what's the help? Who are you going to hire it oversee this whole thing? We'll figure it out. You figured that out. Look, I'm two months from the election and from the election and then at least six months from fermentation, right? At least if I met, that's probably low by mark nine put anytime this is, this is come into play until next September. Right at earliest. Right. The earliest you can come into play is next September.

Speaker 1:          32:10          I hope it's that fast. That'd be amazing. I hope it is that fast, but it isn't five minutes. It's like I'm not doing this so I can become king. We would have a king and that's why we're in trouble. Right, right. I want to give localized control many more options. I, I'm the, I'm the crazy guy who actually means what he says. When I say let teachers teach, I actually mean that most people say it and then they, and their response then becomes, give more administrators. So you think what's stopping them now? Standardized tests and administrators and then funding. That's based on the success of the test and it's correct in the school district, correct. The answer is always more funding. The answer is always more funding and it isn't. It is not that people always say we have to fund fund fund. That is not the answer there. There are better answers out there. Of course.
