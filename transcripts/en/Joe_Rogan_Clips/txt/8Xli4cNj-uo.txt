Speaker 1:          00:00          The last thing that I definitely wanted to talk to you about, it's one of the things that Trump brought up recently is the, uh, JFK case and releasing some of the files and they wanted to redact the information that pertained to the people that were still alive. Now I want to know what, what, I don't know what you could say, but what do you think about the JFK case? Do you think that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone?

Speaker 2:          00:28          Um, I can see

Speaker 2:          00:34          of all the, of all the sort of incidents of all it is, I don't mean to minimize it, but, or I minimize it by calling it an incident. But if all those situations, the Kennedy assassination and Mlk, Martin Luther King's assassination, those are the two that I understand more than anything else. Why they've linkerd, why people don't believe the shit that they've seen and why they, why they have concerns about it. Uh, Martin Luther King more than Kennedy, I believe that there was something there that we still don't understand in terms of who else was responsible and who organize that and who, who assisted in that. Right. I just think of those two. That's the one I've got bigger questions on the Kennedy assassination. I think that, uh, I think that Oswald pulled the trigger. I think in his mind, uh, the reason he was doing it was for the greater good of, of communism and to, uh, boost his image with the Soviets and, and, uh, w with the Cuban regime.

Speaker 2:          01:36          Um, do I think that he had assistance? Um, I don't, you know, I don't think so, but I could be swayed from that with better evidence than I've seen. But, um, I understand why people are so dug in on it, right? Because I mean, look, it was a massive event, right? It was a massive event, but Oswald had sufficient training. You did not have to be a rocket scientist to figure this out. It was a different era. And we don't understand it in today's terms, but when you get right in that position and look out that window and look at the shot that was taken and you know, what was involved in that, I was not, uh, you know, you've shot, you know, this sounds terrible, but you know, every, you know, anybody who's hunted, you know, has taken a more difficult shot in that. Yeah. Um, so that part of it and, and his motivation and his past ties to the Soviets. Do I think the Soviets were pulling the trigger on it too? I think the mafia, we're pulling the trigger. I, I haven't seen anything that convinces me that that was the case. I think that Oswald felt like he was doing it for them or he was just, he was going to prove himself in that regard. But, uh, again, I, I understand why people were dug in the MLK one, Martin Luther King. I just, um, I think that,

Speaker 2:          02:54          I don't think he acted alone. What makes you think that? Um, I think that, look, he was a loser, a two bit criminal, right? Who was constantly getting picked up for the shit that he was doing and ending up in jail. Right? He was a mess, right. There was nothing clever about him. And then leading up to the assassination, he cleaned up his act. Suddenly he went from looking like a two bit, you know, criminal and all to a college professor basically. And he had cash. He was able to, you know, purchase a vehicle and he kind of went off the grid for a while. He went on to this drive, right. And sort of stayed off the grid and he behaved in a way that he hadn't up until, you know, months before this thing took place. And then he ended up in Europe, you know, and, um, I just, uh, something tells me that he had, um, uh, assistance in some fashion.

Speaker 2:          03:53          I don't know who right or whatever, but I just, that's the one that more than, than any others that I've looked at, you know, makes me step back and go, no, we don't, we don't know the whole story here. Um, the Kennedy thing, I again, maybe there's something out there that we just haven't turned over. A, that's always a possibility. But, um, yeah, MLK I think is a, is that's the one that's most disturbing. That's interesting. I don't know enough about the MLK murder. I need to go look into that now. Especially if you think that something was going on. Look at his behavior. Um, what the hell was his name again? James Earl. Ray. James Earl Ray and I, I've talked to his brother, I've interviewed his brother. Um, for what, uh, for a shell, a series a where we did a, uh, kind of, uh, investigative look into this.

Speaker 2:          04:42          Um, and um, I there is, if you, if, if all you do when you're, when you're looking at this is to look at Ray's behavior in that year leading up to the assassination. Um, that's the, that's the interesting for me, that's the most interesting part. I mean, put it in context with everything he did up until that point, which was, he was basically, again, just a tube criminal, couldn't stay out of jail. And then you get this and you get this change in behavior and this change in appearance in this, you know, sudden ability to, you know, be, uh, something that he wasn't up until that point, I guess everybody can change. But that was, that was the most striking part for me. Um, there's no obvious source of income? No. No, just, just uh, just to, you know, just again, just a penny. Any criminal basically. And um, there was plenty of information.

Speaker 2:          05:35          It wasn't like he couldn't have gathered if you say, well no, he acted on his own. Well. Okay. Yeah. Was there information? Yes, the leading right up till the day before there was talk about, well, you know, there were news reports showing a king at the Lorraine Motel. Um, and you know, coming in and out of the room, you know, that he was staying in. And so it wasn't as if, you know, you couldn't gather that information on your own, you know, but it was, again, it was that behavior leading up to it. And I'm not a conspiracy guy at all. Right. I've seen too much shit to, you know, to think that, you know, every conspiracies home water. So, but this one, it was disturbing in that regard. What that's worth. All right. Yeah. You should look into it and we'll talk about next time. See what you think.

Speaker 2:          06:18          Cause I, I'd really be interested in, I think, I don't think we're going to this show that we're going to get ready to do here, start filming and next month is not going to be looking into things like that. What is it? What is it called? It's going to be called black files. They may change the number or the name just before we go on there. But um, you know, I really enjoyed the shows that I did in the past. American declassified with the, they're looking into conspiracies. I've really enjoyed it. I really, really thought it was fascinating and I get why people feel that way. Kennedy for sure it's Kennedy when they're on the outside. The Kennedy wanted to me the bullet is the most disturbing thing. Yeah, the pool would that just showed up on Connolly's Gurney. Oh look where we found, we found this spot and it's not distorted and supposedly went through two people and shattered bone, that magic bullet, the magic bullet.

Speaker 2:          07:01          So I don't buy it. And I don't think that that bullet came from there. That's probably the most of all things. So, cause we, we looked at the grassy knoll issue and the possibility of spa getting other people on the side. Yeah. The fuck out of here. Dot. Bullet. The bullet drives me crazy. It does that there's more pieces of the bullet fragments in Connolly's body. When you look at the, look at the x rays of Conley's bodies that show bullet fragments, there's little pieces they found little tiny pieces of metal in his body from the bullet fragments. Huh. But you don't see that missing from the bullet. It's bullshit. Yeah. The, the bullet thing is, is, and, and I, you know, again, there's, there's elements of it that you look at, but collectively, I just, you know, and again, maybe there's something else out there. Maybe there is and we just haven't uncovered yet. Or maybe this will prompt some additional information. Who knows? But, um, yeah. Anyway, it's, it's fascinating shit. But, uh, I do get it because it was such a seminal moment. Right? And nobody wants to think that something that bad, that horrific. And that's something that could sort of shatter the country in that fashion could be done by one, one guy, Mike Lee Harvey Oswald, or John Hinckley.
