Speaker 1:          00:00          Do you go to mass on Christmas? No. No Mass at all. I go to Willy Wonka's golden chocolate factory. Wow. It's all nonsense, man. Why would I do that? I remember I'm just asking tradition because he grew up that way. No, I never grew up that way. You didn't, you were a kid. Yeah, we did. But it was for a very short amount of time to say I grew up that way. It would be hard because it was, I was out by the time I was at a first grade. Oh yeah. We're talking about putting me back in for second grade, but we moved from New Jersey to San Francisco and uh, we didn't find a Catholic school. And Catholic schools costs money too. You know what? The public school after that, but I was just done. I hated it. I was in fear of those fucking crazy people.

Speaker 1:          00:43          And your parents didn't take you to church or make you good? They did a little bit. I think the idea was back then, that if you had kids, he wanted kids go to Catholic school. You know, there's a lot of people that did that in that neighborhood when I was little. It was just a normal thing you did. Yeah. And they were more strict and to dude, one thing that was for sure though, like I had a conversation with my mom about it once, she was like, you know, your grades were way better when you went into your Catholic school. And I was like, yeah, cause it was fucking terrified to get wrong. They beat the shit out of you want to live like that. They never beat me. They definitely threatened me. Really? Yeah. They threatened to make me sit on the nail. I'm going to have to sit on a nail and the uh, in the closet, stay here all night.

Speaker 1:          01:21          I hope you brought your blanket. They're like really mean when you're like a little six year old kid. Like that's fucked up. It's just a weird, oh this, we stuck with these people for nine months and to also, for me it's like my parents are splitting up at the time. So it was very confusing and then I wanted things to have order to them. So I wanted God to make sense. I remember annoying people with that. Yeah. I'm like six years old. I didn't annoy people talking about what God wants. What do you mean? Like you, God says this, God wants that. Like I would say that six years old because I was a little kid who was dealing with my parents splitting up and there didn't seem to be any order in the world and it was very nervous. Right? So when I finally, when I went to Catholic school, when I first got there, I was, I was happy that it was going to go to Catholic school.

Speaker 1:          02:08          But then as I experienced it at six years old, I started going, this is ridiculous. This doesn't make any sense. I'm like, first of all, these people are so mean. They're, they're obviously being mean and nasty. They're not comforting. And I was thinking as a six year old comparing them the way like my grandma was, and my mother was like, these are, these ladies were nasty and so mean. And I'm like, these, they don't represent God. And I was like, this is crazy sex. And then you could see kids getting in trouble because their parents hadn't paid for their lunch or this guy and it was like this really, you tell your father to get that money in. Like there was a weirdness to it that just didn't seem loving or it didn't seem like what I thought of when I thought of, you know, Christ and when I thought of it seemed to me like, oh no, this is a dark little trap.

Speaker 1:          02:57          Get sucked into. That's what's remarkable about that is not just the age, but that you went from a really, really needing it in a very real way because what was happening with your family to like normally you wouldn't turn that quickly. Like within a year it sounds like, or two. Yeah, it was over by the time I was out of there. Usually that change doesn't happen for 1520 years outside of beating me or doing something sexual to me, the, this, the mind fuck of dealing with those mean nasty ladies scare the shit out of me crying and they were calling me a baby cause I was crying. I was like, whoa. It's just not knowing how to deal with human beings. Yeah. When you're a six year old and this is going down and you're like, what have I done? Yeah. Like I went from always being with my mom or being with my grandma, my grandfather.

Speaker 1:          03:47          I was like, everything's cool. And then all of a sudden you're going to school and this is what you're doing in school. I didn't go to kindergarten. I went to first grade. It was the first thing I went to. Right. So all of a sudden the first grade is like instantaneously being connected to these crazy ladies. She's, I was like, oh no poor. And then I would think about them. I don't think what kind of like, and I was thinking about why this will mean, I remember being like six years old thinking this right. I'm just like, nobody probably loves them. Like they don't get, they don't have a family. I have a boyfriend. I didn't think at the time they don't have a girlfriend, but maybe they do Holla. Right. But for sure they didn't. The whole thing was that they didn't, you know, they didn't have anything. No connection with another human being to be lonelier or more angered inducing. Yeah. It was just dark. They weren't, they weren't loving people.
