Speaker 1:          00:00          Lady gentleman, black helicopters have been spotted. Yeah. Nobody balls harder than them. Yeah. It's pretty out of control. Every week goes Ferrari's, Bentley's Lamborghinis. There's like ridiculous. There's cars that I feel like it would be ridiculous to show up. Why about one of those Bentley's that they have or one of those Bugattis rather than they have as a police car for sure. It's in Santa Ana. Two and a half million bucks. Yeah. So much. I think flug mother has like six. He has so many. He's hilarious. His building habits are hilarious. I love him. And he's got like a whole fleet of list in white. He's like white is right. I got a bunch of two though. Man. Does gang or cars? Oh Man. You owe that money to the IRS. Wanted to just give him a few thoughts because he went so deep. So how much does he owe?

Speaker 1:          00:47          Well, uh, it's more than you want to pay. It's in the 20 plus million dollar range. It's a lot of money, man. But it's not something that he's been, uh, it's not like deception. No, it's just neglect to, to pick black. And it's also like, I think, and there is like a truth to this, he makes so much money. There's probably a point when they're like, hey, it's time to pay your taxes. And you go like, all right, here's a check for $25 million. That's an incredible amount of money. And then they go, that's true, but you owe 50 more. And he's just like, that's, that can't be right. I've got $25 million. Yeah. Like what are you talking about man? He's bought over a hundred luxury cars and the same dealer and always pays and cat oh areas. I love it. 15 million worth of car congratulated.

He can get that money to, you know, it's um, it's, it's just, it's, it's, he's really interesting in the amount of money that is able to generate, you know, he's figured out some pretty incredible shit. He's a great villain to man. Oh, he's just brilliant at it and he's just a brilliant defensive boxer. Oh, skill wise. Off the charts off the truck. We're saying that guy should get more credit for what he does as a skilled businessman and psychological warrior. Like he should get a lot more credit for it. Yeah, I think so too. I think it's, it's arguable that, you know, he's enjoying it and he let enjoys playing the villain role and enjoys like flashed on the money and if he is really enjoying it, like don't you love that and respect that, that fucking thing.
