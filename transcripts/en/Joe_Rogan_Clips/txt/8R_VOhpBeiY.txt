Speaker 1:          00:00          That's like crazy. The breath. How was me seeing a headline of them on deadline? I know they have a new show. I know that it's good for all of us, but like

Speaker 2:          00:17          new show and it's in the slot that your show was in.

Speaker 1:          00:21          You know what it is. I literally have to unfollow girls sometimes who I'm friends with who are in, who are comedians, who are my peers and who I respect and think they're funny. I have to unfollow them if I see that they're just like, I'm working a lot right now and they're putting out there that they're like really busy with work and I just got kicked off dancing with the stars. I have to unfollow them because? Because I start to feel sad about myself and I would rather just remove that from my feed then and then it's a really awkward follow when I know or they messaged me on one of those things and they see I'm not following them because it's like we all know we follow each other. Right. They know and sometimes I'll just tell them, I'm unfollowed you because you, you make me feel sad about my own career. I'm not going to get over that. It's easier to just take them out of my feed. Yeah, but that's a weird one. I am working to get over it that I am

Speaker 2:          01:12          just, just use it as infor like his inspiration. Use them as fuel to work harder.

Speaker 1:          01:18          Yeah, I do. But I would also like to not see their toward eight schedule all crazy. It got crazy. That one go. That's not a good one to accept. I don't think. You know what? I probably, I'm probably going to unfollow one a all all you guys with your, with your workouts and your calorie counts that you've posted them a couple times but I didn't even post the big one. I didn't literally growing as fuck to people who, who are like, Eh, you know, hate their bodies and stuff. Yeah. It can be very triggering. So like girls, they're like, I just ran a marathon. I'm like, unfollow. I can't, I can't have you in my life bragging about the shit. Listen, I go to the gym too and I don't tweet about it. I want to, Goddamn, I want to, I just heard so many calories, but I don't tweet tweet about it because I don't want to trigger people and I don't want to be the, I don't want to be what I am so jealous of, but I should brag about it. And I also like that some people are like, look at what I just did it the gym. Fuck you. I'd worked today and they're proud of themselves, but I can't, I can't see. I get inspired. Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:23          Do you know who I go to like all the time for inspiration? The Rock? Yeah. That motherfucker never stops. He never stops. I mean, I don't want to do what he's doing. I don't want to do these movies. I don't want to do what he's doing, but that I fucking admire the shit out of that guy's work ethic. That guy, I'll fly to Tokyo, it will be four o'clock in the morning. He sets up an elliptical machine, starts going after it. That's what he does.

Speaker 1:          02:45          And that doesn't make, that doesn't put you in a place of like, I'm, I'm never, I can't, no, no, because you can, but the thing is, Joe Rogan, you can do that. Look at that. Look at all his food and he gets to do that because you said, Oh God,

Speaker 2:          02:56          he landed in London, midnight ordered Sushi like a motherfucker. Go to his, uh, his Instagram with all the workout ones. This is, you are the Rock Joe. You are the rock. You do these workouts all the time. That's how you get that shirt. That's what I'm saying. Rock. I got a text today from David Goggins and I told David Goggins I'm trying to beat everyone by double. He's like, fuck yeah, kill it. Like capital a hundred exclamation points. That's what I'm saying. Look at that dude focused. I see that. I want to go work out right now.
