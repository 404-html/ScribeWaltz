Speaker 1:          00:03          Why is this not legal here? Well, uh, it, it's considered to be a new drug by the FDA and that's the number one reason. There are four countries so far that have approved MSC products. There's Canada and New Zealand were the first to go to Canada and get this done. Well not for the only, only for certain conditions. So in Canada, New Zealand they approved bone marrow Mscs, which are in my mind are not as good as umbilical cord. And I explained why, um, and, and then South Korea as approved and biblical cord for knee osteoarthritis only. So the cells have to be injected into the knee. And then Japan just recently approved the same product. That's it. It's used to treat very serious acute graph, acute graft versus host disease in children after they've had a bone marrow. That's fine. Now are there peer reviewed studies or anything that shows the efficacy of this intravenous use of these stem cells?

Speaker 1:          01:03          Yeah, there, there are hundreds. There are hundreds. And my book MSC, which is, you know, you don't want to read it unless you want to go to sleep unless you're looking for something, you know, it's just, it really is purely a research tool. Um, we have 800 references and we reference every clinical trial that's ever been done with mscs and human beings and there are 800. Okay. Well I've had some great results with stem cells. Doctor Rodney Mcgee in Las Vegas, a shot a bunch into my shoulder. I was at the door of surgery. I was like my shoulders and pain all the time. I can't do a lot. Every time I do something I have to ice it down for a day and now I have full function. I mean, it's crazy. I mean I was literally, I mean it still clicks. I've got some weird shit in there and there's probably some stuff floating around in there.

Speaker 1:          01:46          But as far as like the function of my shoulder and the pain, it's like a 100% I can do basically everything. Right, right. Yeah. Yeah. I was 57, 58 years old and this is like what, four or five years ago? And both my shoulders torn labor rooms, arthritis, bone spurs, like rotator cuff issues. And I went down and I got 10 billion sales in each shoulder. I said to the doc and how's this going to hurt? And he says, only when it comes out the other side. But he put it in and it was, you could feel him pierce the capsule and you could feel pressure. And I couldn't flap my wings for three days, but after that, no more problems. And this is different than the stem cells that you can get in the United States currently? Yes. What's the difference? Well, the difference from umbilical cords, I had a, what is it called?

Speaker 1:          02:36          What's the kind that you can get here in the United States? Well, you can use the only thing that's legally legal in the u s at least for now, I don't think it's going to be last much longer as from amnion. Yeah, there's an exemption in the, uh, it's a federal federal exemption for the use of amnion for wound covering. And a lot of people have now translated, now they're using it in joints and things that, but you don't think they're going to be able to do that very much longer? I don't believe so. Why is that a, cause this commissioner FDA Commissioner has made it very clear that he doesn't like it and, and they, they really haven't liked it for quite some time. Um, because the, the exemption is for one thing and, and, and, and doctors are using it for all kinds of other things.

Speaker 1:          03:18          I don't necessarily agree with it. I just, I just know what's coming down the pike from a regulatory standpoint. Uh, and, and you know, there've been some regulatory things that have come out. They've gone after clinics and you know, I think they've shut down three places in just in the last couple of months and they haven't gone after amnion yet. But I think they're building their case for it and unfortunately that's what's going to happen. So why would they go after it? That's what's confusing. If you've seen all these benefits and I haven't heard anything about negative results. Yeah, I don't, I don't understand it myself to be honest with you. It's, you know, amnion it's been used clinically in the United States for over a hundred years, uh, without serious adverse events. But, um, I think it's more about the claims that people are making because there, there haven't been studies, for example, of Amnion, you know, amnion tissue injected into a joint.

Speaker 1:          04:08          And I think that the biggest concern is the claims that are being made and maybe people are being vulnerably, you know, I don't know, vulnerable to the economics of it. I'm, I'm not really sure, but I know that I just, you know, I have my finger on the pulse and, and that's, it seems like they're gone. They're gone after fat. You know, we were the first in the world to use fat derived stem cells in, in 2006 in 2007, we published in on using those to treat rheumatoid arthritis and, and, uh, multiple sclerosis, a, and then a lot of doctors in the u s started doing that now. Now there's new guidance to industry that came out a few months ago that specifically prohibits using it for, for example, taking your own fat, isolating the stem cells out of it, and then, uh, injecting them in your bloodstream or even a jacking him into a joint. So, um, I, I don't, I don't really know the whole, the motivation behind it, but I know that the, the very clearly stated that that's not going to fly anymore.

Speaker 2:          05:17          [inaudible] yeah.
