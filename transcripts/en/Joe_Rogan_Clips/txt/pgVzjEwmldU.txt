Speaker 1:          00:00          I was telling you guys before I had an issue today where my credit card got robbed and uh, you know, whatever credit card fraud, someone got ahold of my number, which is really, that's the one thing that people worry about the most about shopping online. Right. But I guess that could kind of happen everywhere, but you got to think that if there's anything that has changed malls more than anything, it's gotta be the ability to just shop online on your phone like Amazon. That the fact that they figured that out. I remember when Amazon came out and it was just a bookstore. I was like, who the fuck is going to buy books online? You can just go to the bookstore. This is ridiculous. What a stupid business. Meanwhile, that guy has more money than any human on the planet. That's right. Yet the poor bastards getting divorced too.

Speaker 1:          00:44          I heard last night that there's a rule and we lash Washington. That everything that you make as a couple, you have to split. We've been together for over 25 years. Well, California, California law is, yes, 50 50 well, longterm marriages 20 years or 10 years or more. It's 50 50 and that includes downstream income. You know from anything you did that you're still getting paid for. Say 10 years ago you wrote a book or whatever Mrs. Bezos is getting, he's worth a hundred plus billion dollars. They said, wow, so she's going to get half of that, but probably going to, because it's a lot of stock. They said they're going to have to just be stay friends because oh they better. She should be super nice to him. Even if he only gives her a quarter if she's like, I got Rollin, I got wrong. The richest people in the world now, but after all these bookstores, man in a business, there's some irony that Amazon now wants to start opening physical brick and mortar stores.

Speaker 1:          01:41          That is kind of ironic, but it does make sense though because there are some brick and mortar stores and I think that guy's a conquer. I think he just wants to take over everything. Well, why else would he buy whole foods? And I was like, ah, the supermarket business, I can fuck this up too. Well automated. He can, I don't know, maybe you could order whole foods delivered to your house. I think the, I ended up that's available yet, but I think it is right. Yeah, I was to say it now. Most grocery stores, even like all the Ralphs have home delivery with it two hours to compete with Amazon prime. Yeah. Wow. Are, and if they don't do that, you can just order it online and pick it up. And I'll bring out too, I went to pavilion's the other day and they had a bunch of delivery trucks parked in the parking lot.

Speaker 1:          02:21          I was like, well look at this. Like, think of these cool delivery trucks. Have to have that one store you can walk in and there's no cashiers. They just trust that everyone's not stealing. And I think they just are a comfortable with a certain amount of theft. Oh Wow. Hmm. That's interesting. Well, they probably have cameras everywhere too, you know? But it's, um, the online purchasing like that has got to put, that must be putting the most, as far as like the most impact on stores, brick and mortar stores. It's like the ability to purchase online. It's got to be devastating for them. Right. Totally. And up in Santa Barbara, where I live now, just a riding up state street this morning, at the end of the ride, you know, it's like the third, maybe a quarter of the stores are closed. I had a business empty and you know, state street, Santa Barbara, this was like the happened in place to be. And I, and a real estate friend of mine says, Oh, well, let's see that store there. That's, you know, $22,000 a month to lease. Like, Whoa, okay. So you have to, you have to have a retail outlet that's really turning over the customers. And there's a lot that just can't do that. I mean, you can't have an antique store that's going to do that are a little knickknack store.
