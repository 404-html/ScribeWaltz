Speaker 1:          00:00          Where we're at now. I mean, I expect sometime next week to get an announcement this, this bill should have been passed and brought into the house a long time ago. And, uh, you know, not the case still. Dot. Still stalled and everything. And again, it's all lobbying, illegal lobbying, which may or may not turn into some, uh, problems for Senator Don Plett. Correct me if I'm wrong, but for a while, some of the, some of the parks in the United States would get them from some of the parks and Canada, which would get them from Russians and Chinese who would capture them in the wild. Right? So, so the parks, the United States would say that they don't capture whales. So what they would do is marine la would capture a boatload of wild ones. And then once, uh, uh, they would do it personally while they would pay some Russians to, to capture the elections that they always use.

Speaker 1:          00:43          Oh God. Damn. Russians. Oh Man, I'm not going to cheat at the Olympics. They're stealing whales. So they bring the whales in wild. Those wa those, those whales have. For instance, uh, you know, they Syrah calf, that calf is now deemed a captive born and now it can be shipped to the states. And so it, so what marine land was doing was just breeding like crazy and in sending them to seaworld and that's how we got the, the killer whale to begin with. How we got I Kaikos you know, big trade with Belugas and, and so that's what we're trying to put an end to because all these loopholes, you know, Marineland really capitalized on this, but they want a long time lobbying the government for years. I mean they've been around for 50 plus years. They've had, they've, they've done all the right moves a businessman would do if he wants to keep a thriving business without too many hands sort of keeping them from doing anything.

Speaker 1:          01:26          It's just so disturbing that we're willing to just accept this because we don't know what they're saying. You know, we know that they have a really complex language. We can't decipher it though because it's so alien in terms of like the sounds that they make. It's not something we put into a box, but it's not like any other animal, but you in dolphins and killer whales and Wales in general, they make sounds in it with a range of complexity that's just unrivaled in nature outside of humans. And their auditory system is so complex. When you put them in a, we put them in a concrete pool. Just imagine what I mean. I, I put my ears under the water and it's loud. The filters are going, you've got different sounds. I mean, right. Water being pushed in from this pipe and that scream and people screaming music louder.

Speaker 1:          02:07          Louder, louder. Popcorn. The audience figures. Yeah. God Damn. It's a, I mean, I, I look at them almost like they're kind of, I mean, they're definitely not human, but they're kind of people. They like a water people. It's weird. If you, if you put yourself in the mindset of looking at an animal and you're trying to change your perception of them a little bit rather than, than sort of disassociating and you'd look at him, you, you stuck, you can actually see that. They're like, oh, it's like they're people, man. Like that's, that's just a different meat suit. Yeah, like, and then you deal with killer whales and stuff. I mean, well, they evolved in a different environment, but they evolve to be incredibly social, a highly dynamic populations. They, they live in these very intimate groups. They stay together for life. A male killer whale, we'll never leave.

Speaker 1:          02:55          It's mother's side over its lifetime. It'll stay within about a body's. It's entire life. Unless the pause, there's beating on it, then I'll just stay out on the outside of the pod for awhile. At least they have that luxury of escape where in captivity, males get the shit kicked out of them. They're a big puppy dogs, big male. Orchids, I mean, yeah. Okay. They're murderous and they're killing people, but they're actually big puppy dogs. They're there. I always felt so bad for candy. We had this big male, beautiful, big bull male. He was just, he was rocked his existence. I having been pulled from his mother, and this is really largely explains why went off. You ruined their lives. That's over. I mean their whole 30 on diets, the reason they live, remember too, they remember going a month that fuck man, it's just why do we allow this?

Speaker 1:          03:38          It seems to me like, like almost a form of slavery. I mean, I don't want to diminish the horrors of human slavery because in human slavery at least there's no question whatsoever that that's a human and there's communication. Yeah. So it's, it's as awful as it gets. But God damn put the ignorance aside. The slavery of killer whales is like really close. It's really close. The only way to get them to work effectively and efficiently is to keep them hungry. Oh, drug them and keep them hungry. So yeah, it's brutal. Now is it still legal? I mean, isn't, see, he's since seaworld. Are they expanding? Didn't they just make a bigger, a pool for the silhouettes? Like, well, we're slow. We're so nice to her killer whales. We gave him a bigger k. Yeah. So what they've done is they've tried to repackage the show as we were not doing the big dynamic show, but they really still are.

Speaker 1:          04:30          They're like, we're just showing natural behaviors. Which is bitch natural behavior. Let them go fuck up a whale. Shit. They put a fuck. They put like a, like a backdrop of a couple trees assumption, new show. Hey, see, well this is what other crazy shit going on. I mean in, in a, in California, see world now see where promise to stop banning. Uh, uh, they, they promised to stop breathing the killer whales. But these fucking promises don't do not believe for a moment that they're like some type of responsible corporate citizens. It's gonna hold on to this thing. It's bullshit. So we're an entity, a business entity. They're trying to make money. And so what California did was they went out and banned it. So in California you can't breed Orkos. I import export issues, all that, but in Florida. So again, see what makes the promise.

Speaker 1:          05:12          They had an Orca protection act that they were looking to do exactly. California. We're going to put it, they were going to make it concrete passed the law that way that we see world can't just backpedal on it down the road, which everyone suspects they will see where this lobbying like fucking crazy and just just last week says successfully defeated the bill again, they're putting a lot of the world is trying to defeat a bill that they successfully defeated multiple times, including that just last week that allows them or be the bill would keep them from breeding these animals in captivity. You're fighting against that successfully fighting. It's over. They're doing it in Florida. Yeah. While they're pretending in California, they don't want to breed them. Well, no. In California, they actually passed the law, the State Law in Florida. It was defeated repeatedly and now fun last down. So they're trying, they're trying to breed animals in captivity and if they do breed them in Florida, there'll be able to ship them to California, to China.

Speaker 1:          06:02          So that's what the demand is right now. And in fact, seaworld was just bought by a large Chinese corporation they just named. They just named one of the, one of the guys to the seaworld board. And so what people, I mean it's safe to assume that this is exactly what's happening is zero. This is planning their exit strategy and they're gonna start sending their, their orcas to, to China. Oh Geez. That's a booming industry right now. In fact, killer whale captivity is like, if you can get your and there and it's all coming out of Russia, right still. But, and so there's still capturing them in the wild. Yup. And in China it's, it's a, it's a burgeoning, a booming industry man. 44 [inaudible] lotion, theme parks in China right now. She is building a black crazy. How many of them are in the United States? How many aquariums?

Speaker 1:          06:50          Yeah, I don't know. I can't, I can't say for sure. Ah, I was actually surprised to read there's like 300 something dolphins in captivity in the states. I didn't, I think that was the number I saw. I didn't realize there was that big. I had no idea that there was that many in captivity in the states. It just seems to be such an archaic thing that it just, I can't imagine that the United States wants to keep doing that. The fact that seaworld is trying to keep doing that in Florida and that they've successfully lobbied to allow them to keep breeding these animals in captivity. But you can't, once you have them in captivity for a long time, safe seaworld wanted to release them. They can't really release them. There's nowhere to release them. And that's what's being worked on now. There's a project called the whale sanctuary project and I, I suspect there'll be a fairly large announcement soon.

Speaker 1:          07:31          I believe there'll be looking at a location and in Canada and they're going to build this thing though there will be a place for them, which is a great place to do it because then how would they do that? Well you go coastal of course. I mean you gotta be in the ocean and you got a pen off an area. You've got to, I mean there's lots of things to consider. You've got to make sure there's a lot of water changes. So a lot of different things. Cause you can't keep the animal and something that's going to stagnate the minute. So it's going to be some sort of a cage it, yeah. I'm assume a fence of sorts around there. Maybe like a fjord. I wouldn't be a fjord if it's in Canada, but like just imagine jump it. I imagine that they'll make certain that that's not going to be the case.

Speaker 1:          08:04          But uh, while they can, I've seen, I've seen dolphins jump out of the pool. That's crazy. Really? Yeah. Yeah. I got rushed in one morning to, uh, uh, called him because uh, because a dolphin jumped out of the pool. Holy Shit. I mean that's a wake up call when you get there and you see this thing flopping around and you're like, Jesus Christ and I didn't do well. You get the sling together. First off, there's, you know, we have these different slings and things that, you know, to move these dolphins. So I was, I was alone. I was a dolphin way. Yeah. Like 500 pounds, 600 pounds. In this case she was, she was a decent size female. So I went and grabbed a kid out in the ticket booth. There's some shifts. It was too early in the morning. I had no staff there. Russia men.

Speaker 1:          08:38          I'm like, dude, I got two guys. I'm like, we gotta get this dolphin and these guys. I mean, if you've never done that before, your jaws on the floor. I fucking had these two steel poles on my shoulders. Dolphin in the sling, lifting her up. I swear to you, man, my back went backwards like this. It was the heaviest thing I'd ever carried, but we got her back in. It was crazy. But yeah, jumped out of the pool. It was crazy. In fact, there was a time in the summer, I remember where one of our dolphins were teetering on the edge, which you would do, is she, you know, they're, they're always spy hop and like this, looking over the edge of the crowd, explaining that to people that are just listening, just listening. So imagine there's like a short wall, something that they can look over.

Speaker 1:          09:11          So there's sort of spy hop in there, spying up to look. Okay. One of our dolphins learned that she can actually jump up on the ledge and balance. Now she was on that. That's like an eight foot drop to the concrete and the other side of the school. She's up there posing. I'm hearing the crowd, I'm backstage. I hear the crowd going crazy. I'm like, what is this? I go with her. She's having fun doing this. Holy Shit. That's the dolphin that jumped out as what we did with, I said we got to take her out of this pool. We took her out, put her in the back pool where no one would see her of course. And that's the next day she actually jumped. So she'd be dead today if we hadn't of moved her. Oh. Then of course all Marineland did was put up like more, you know, more obstruction, things to keep, keep me in the pool.

Speaker 1:          09:43          So now when you find her outside of the pool, how long had she been outside for? She was still wet, so it wasn't so bad. But one, uh, one dolphin was, we found her that she, she, she got stuck on the stage overnight. And when we got there, her skin had become so dry that it was, it was starting to crack. It was kind of fucked up. She actually has this permanent scar from try not to yeah. And a chunk come out when, I don't know what she was probably thrashed. Are you talking to her when you find there? Do you try to comfort her? Like, I mean, yeah, sure. I'm hugging her and everything else. Let's say she, did she calm down when she realizes that people were trying to help her? Like are they aware of what's going on or she in a panic, they always fight.

Speaker 1:          10:22          They always fight if they don't want to. I mean this particular dolphin was a fighter. Every time we ever tried to put her in a sling. And we were, I mean one time I love, I could go back in memories and I can, I can remember my thoughts during these times. And uh, we had her in a sling hovering over the pool. And the way the sling is is you've got two holes in the sling where the pex go in, right, the pectoral fins. And then one where the genital slit is. So if they shit, it doesn't end up stuck in the, in the sling, but, and then you've got a crane, a top. So now you've got this thing lifted over the pool. Well, she's fighting like crazy and we can see that there's a tear in the sling as she's fighting, fighting, fighting.

Speaker 1:          10:54          We'd get her, the crane just gets rid of the pool to sling rip. She's plunked into the pool. Holy Shit Man. And we've, we've slimmed out like 15,000 pound or 10,000 pound killer whales over like 30 40 feet in the air. Imagine one of those five drops. Oh my God. So that was sort of a wake up call. Wow. Yeah. Archaic procedures, man. Moving these, these things. The things that, especially at a place like marine land, Marine Marineland when you step through the doors and hopefully you don't, but if you do, it's like you've gone back to the 70s the jazz, any of this hurt their business. Attendance is abysmal over there. They're crushed. I live right. I S I watched the sunset over marine land from my front yard. It's a beautiful site. I drive by, of course, just about every day that their attendance is rocked and Niagara Falls, which where it is, where marine land is, is booming.

Speaker 1:          11:45          The tourism is through the roof. You can't, it's shoulder to shoulder over there and Murraylands seeing none of it. And you think it's because people know about the conditions of, absolutely. I've got a lot of support in the local community. Like people know exactly what's going on. A tourist, it's a little more difficult than, you know, Nag falls welcomes millions of them, so you're going to get a fraction of that, but it is a fraction. Murraylands not benefiting from the booming tourism there. They're on their way out the, they're on a clock for sure. For sure. I'd be shocked to hear them opening in 2019 I'm not going to make that prediction, but I would be shocked. It's, it's that bad. But to be fair, there's no investors at Marineland. It's one sole controlling mine owner who started with nothing. He started with 2000 bucks, built this thing.

Speaker 1:          12:22          He is indebted to nobody. He's, you know, his cash rich. Of course, and he's got a lot of fuck you money and not a lot of times. So he's out to fuck shit up. I wouldn't be surprised to know. And a lot of time in life. You mean like 84 years old now? Yeah. And so, uh, I would, I wouldn't be surprised to think that he's rationalized in his mind to just fucking sewer this thing like destroy, destroy all our lives. We're having spoken out but just tank the park in the process. Fucking wow. Yeah. He's very defined. He's a, he's a, he's a very paranoid and defiant men. And so, you know, at 84 years old, what else does he have left to accomplish? I guess so you were saying that 50 Beluga whales, B plus maybe even 60 at this point, Beluga whales are huge. Yeah. What is a big one way?

Speaker 1:          13:06          I don't know if we've ever met, if we ever actually weighed our big magnetic yes. At 4,000 pounds, maybe five. You got 50 of those. 50 of them. Yeah. That's insane. Try Catching one. Oh, I don't want to try it. I used to get tasked with, here's your, here's your scuba gear, here's a, a net the size of a football field called catch that Beluga whale is that me and my buddies would be like, okay, here we go. Oh Dude, you'd be, you'd be, it really would be amazing to be able to capture the things we've done on video. Can you recognize the difference in intelligence between killer whales, dolphins, Beluga whales, dolphins, dolphins, and killer whales are like remarkably similar. Just cunning. Smart. You could turn your back and they're pickpocketing you. I mean they are just, and they're brats and I love brats.

Speaker 1:          13:47          I mean they just are bratty animal. They're having fun. They're having, while they're fucking with you, they would like to make things difficult. If they know, if they know how to frustrate you, they're going to exercise that. So it's always a mental game, especially with when you're dealing with animals, training with analysts, a Beluga whales are really timid. So like, you know, they call him the canaries of the seat, cause it kind of skittish. So, I don't know if that's a reflection of their intelligence necessarily, but I would call them like maybe, uh, uh, maybe a hint more dumb, dumb than then the next one. Right. But, you know, they're more scared shitless of either not, you know, by Lucas. They don't really want it. They don't want to be, but they're not as smart as dolphins or not. I wouldn't say so. I mean, they split their internal Raga me some way, some way intelligent. Yeah. Yeah.
