Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay. I have to try this just because it's disgusting. So tell me what the name of the candy is again. Pulse pit spell that. P. U. L. U. L. S. E. It's a green mango candy. Yeah, it's originally, it's a classic snuck right where they use the sulfur salt. It's called black salt and they'd put a bit of Chili and sulfur salt on mango. And I have to admit that when I had the real green mango with the sulfur salt is not that bad. That candy was like pushed. It's like the mega warheads, you know, that we had as kids. I wonder too sometimes like the Gamey flavor of the pheasant, the cheese, that is the yield of that is it? I see it sometimes as a bit of a, like, you know, the ghost pepper is a bit of a pissing contest between, yeah. You know, like it's like no one could possibly enjoy the taste of ghost pepper.

Speaker 1:          00:47          No, no. I mean, does it even have a taste? I mean, you even responding to that taste, I won't even try it. Have you, you know who you know, who loves that? You know, Olivier, those guys, they have like what they watch, like game of Thrones, they get together and they, those peppers, oh yeah, they have like Olivia all bone merciay who's a fighter in the UFC and they'll, they'll have like ghost pepper parties, you know, and then the next day they'll go to comicon and dress up as superheroes and then play some online poker and then eat more ghost peppers. And he's also a UFC fighter. You got to think he's a very extreme human being. These are funny kid. I was very, very, very nice guy guys. Brilliant to know that he was a trained killer. You would have no idea if you talked to him.

Speaker 1:          01:31          It just seems like a jail. Yeah, he's a sweetie could kid. And it's a good for us. It's interesting. You know, we, we actually have a bit of a chapter in the book where we talk loosely about those guys and that relationship where you guys sponsored him or something. He four before the Reebok thing. Yeah. Because I remember one, one of the fights that we did in Montreal, um, we went to your restaurant afterwards and Livier showed up after his fight and you guys were congratulating him on his, uh, his fiance's, his wife works, his girlfriend works with us at the restaurant and for a long time now and uh, you know, we met because these guys, it's, it's interesting. Hey, there's super into food and they're open to a lot of things and they're curious and a lot of them get aimed in the wrong direction, you know, like the brown rice and chicken direction and you're responsible for in big part for the awakening, the nutritional awakening of these guys.

Speaker 1:          02:33          You know, a lot of them go for their gun license and health just to be able to hunt. They go fishing on the weekend, they go for like two hours hike in the woods and like little fishing rod. They come back with droughts and we get a phone call. He's like, Hey Fred, I go fish for trout. You know, what do I do with that? You know, it's, it's a great thing. And Yeah, we did. We did sponsored them after. But then what we do now is we, um, we cook for them a post way in, ah, Marco did GSP or the last fight at Madison Square Gardens. They were, the boys were there for a week. Uh, we've done, Tim Kennedy came for a week and just hung out and cook meals. We sat in the kids, uh, Marco and Fred goes and Gab goes, uh, got real drunk polo.

Speaker 1:          03:14          They'd go, they rent a suite and they prepare all of the meals up to weight cut and afterwards. And do they have nutritional requirements for the weight cut and like just like the weekend they do, they have a nutritionist there with them, but then they, they have the crime. But my, I have a take on that is if the nutritionist writes a plan and the food's not good and you don't eat it, then it doesn't, it doesn't work. Right. Like can even write on paper. But if you don't take the pill, then you don't eat chicken and Kale. This much grabs this. But we can professional cook, we'll make the Kale delicious or Brussels prize and the chicken properly cause the Kale could be bad and the chicken can be dry thing too. That works that you guys are already suffering. The thing that works the best in that case is that all of a sudden you have in the room, we set up a little table, which is, so it's not like playstation dirty underwear's like pre-fight vibe.

Speaker 1:          04:15          It's dining with dining with friends. And whether it's Marco Gab me, we know we don't talk. If you don't want to talk, we want to talk, we're here, you know, and we'll, we'll, we'll hang out. But then you feel like your eggs in that Tortilla, you feel like your eggs with potatoes or like it's mellow and it helps a lot with the, just the context of not being like ordering pizza from room service. George used to tell us whole horror stories, you know, but for some of his biggest wins years ago with George say eating like room service Rigatoni and pizza before like a major fight, you know. So now it's different.
