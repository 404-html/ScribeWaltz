Speaker 1:          00:00          Dude, he wanted to knock that dude out so bad after he got knocked out in the MMA fight. He wanted to knock him out in his rules. And I think that is what you saw with Cody this weekend. Too much emotion. One fight. Yeah man. We were talking about that and watching the replays like you could see in his face that every shot he was trying to knock

Speaker 2:          00:19          came out with. As soon as I saw him walk, I mean not walk out. I said he looked okay walking out as soon as it's like the bell rung, I was like, he just did. He looked a little stiff. Yeah. You know, and I was hoping he would shake it off, get in the rhythm, like land, a couple jabs, just like, you know, we were working on, when I spar with them a couple times leading up to the TJ fight, I'll go up to Alpha male to do my wrestling. And a lot of my grappling, um, you know, they have so many 130 545 pounders up there that it's only an hour and half away drive. Right. It only makes sense to go up there and exchange knowledge. So, you know, as soon as I saw him walk out and started the fight, I was like, I hope she just, he just shakes it off and like gets into his, his groove.

Speaker 2:          01:02          Like when he fought dom like artwork, that was, that was incredible. He just let him come to him and I was hoping that that was, what was his game plan? No cause fucking man. So no, he, he wanted to use more wrestling from what we were talking to Danny and all those guys about it. He wanted to use more wrestling and definitely a lot of kicks. He wanted to kick a little bit as well. But he also wanted to just do the same thing to what he did to dom, you know, just kind of like piece of mobe. And I mean considering the last fight, he almost finish him in the first round when they first fought, he was like, I can, I can do this. I can finish this guy.

Speaker 1:          01:37          Well I think he could finish anybody. Yeah. But it's, he's got to go about it the right way. And I thought he was going about it the right way initially with the kicks. And I was like, look, even if these are just landing on the arms, like these are going to soften TJ up. These are brutal. He was throwing some brutal kicks it, and it was a totally different thing. He was, he was adding a whole different aspect to the fight that he did in the first part. And it wasn't, it wasn't, uh, it, it, it, it, when he started throwing the kicks, I was like, yeah, there's the game plan. I see, I see what's going beautiful. And then when he pointed to the ground and he was like, yes, he couldn't touch me. I'm like, oh, he's starting to get in this rhythm.

Speaker 1:          02:14          But that's what I hate about immediate rematches after knockout. It's just, it's still in your head. It's just the confidence level, the anger, the emotion. Like, you know, Henry two, three years between his fight with Dj, where he got finished in the first round or fights fighting some other people. Uh, he was a different human. Absolutely. But if he had fought DJ the very next fight, who knows how that goes, right? That would be hard to sell less. Henry was the champion and Dj took the crown from him. This was the whole idea was that, you know, Cody had beat dom Cody was the champ and that Cody was defending the honor of Alpha male and Tj was this snake in the grass. They were gonna put away, you know, that was the whole idea behind the ultimate fighter. And it was just so, I don't think there's ever been a fight other than maybe Ronda and Meesha that had more emotion, just more, you know, bad blood by the rendezvous. Ameesha thing might've been worse. It's, people don't remember how hated Rhonda was after that. Meesha Fike she wouldn't shake me. She's hand like me. She tried to shake your hand and Ron was like, bitch could, I didn't just walk away from Marinette. And everyone's like, whoa. Like why was interviewing her was just blew the whole audience was booing those emotional fights. They're so compelling to watch, but man, there are so fraught with peril for them.
