Speaker 1:          00:00          You are getting into the movie business, right? You've been doing a few movies. Why aren't you doing a movie during the time you were doing the Rockhold fight? That's right. Yeah, I was filming trip relax. Um, yeah. Yeah. I've been out there for about three months and then I was flying home and I was looking for some walkie talkies for my seven year old. Uh, I don't know why I thought that'd be a good idea. It turns out getting hold of walkie talkies isn't very easy these days. I've went on a fucking wild goose chase trying to get these fucking walkie talkies that didn't even get played with. He was like, yeah, cool. I've got a phone dad. I like, yeah, I should have thought of that. But um, and as I'm looking for them, I check Twitter, I've got a coffee and I see Chris Weidman and pulled out.

Speaker 1:          00:37          So yeah, it takes Dana. I said, listen, if this is true, you know, you know where I am. And he was like, oh great, we love that, you know, blah blah blah, blah blah. But Jack Arrays, our first option. So I thought for a minute there, I thought I was getting a towel shot and I thought there's no way Jackie Ray's going to turn it down. So I went to my buddy's Jason's house and watched a basketball game and had a few drinks and you know, it didn't party as such. I was on set the next day but had a few drinks. Now if I knew I was fighting for a world belt in two weeks, you know, I would have been on a strict diet, not overindulging but I definitely overindulged and then the next day and walking into the gym just have, you know, and just a little light workout and my phone starts exploding lighting up like a Christmas tree and like what the hell? And then our aerial Hawaiian, he calls me. Is that Mike Dana just announced with sports center that you find for the belt?

Speaker 1:          01:28          I was the first I heard about it. I love fucking Dana. We all, God bless him. So, um, that whole shit. So I'm panicking like crazy. How much did you work? That's the first thing I did. I ran into the changing rooms. Got on the scale. I was at two 15, two 16 cause that rough. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. I like to do like a week before I like to be 200 pounds. So this is two weeks before and I'm 215 so much shit screwed the weights and need to run. So I just run out at the gym, throw my backpack on my shoulders and just of sprinting through Toronto city center, like a mad man. Of course there's traffic lights every 30 seconds. So I don't want to stop at the traffic lights cause that's no good. So I'm just running out, nearly getting run over by taxis and jumping off of homeless people falling over docking and dive.

Speaker 1:          02:12          And it was great training. And then Dana called, who's I'm negotiating, you know, the Fi whilst running through Toronto and then, uh, carried on going and then I ended up like in the middle of nowhere. I just running and running and running and then Jason Parillo gets on the phone and uh, you know, all the doubt starts creeping in. I started thinking, Jesus Christ is salt. Typical of my career. I've wanted at a towel fight my whole career. You know, I've been through many ups and downs and now here I am, I get the title fights on two weeks notice that'd be filming a God damn movie. I've been near a gym and a major in for a while doing anything unless against somebody that's already beaten me. So I'm kind of destined to fail this soft fucking typical. And then Jason got on the phone and you know, he talked to me round big time.

Speaker 1:          02:56          You know, I said a lot of very positive things. Jason's an amazing coach is incredible. It really is. There's a lot of, it was a lot of trainers out there. Uh, there's a lot of pad man. You know, there's a lot of fakers in mixed martial arts. Certainly these days. You know, I mean guys that really have true heritage in martial arts or any kind of steep history in combat sports, they're few and far between. Yeah. You know, you can train. Any guy can watch a video and it's a little bit of coordination, how to hold pads and you see them. It's all the crazy, isn't it? These days in pads to get fit, you know, one, two left talk. Whew. You know, just cause you can do that and hold pause doesn't make you a coach does not make you a coach and there's a lot of fakers out there.

Speaker 1:          03:39          But Jason is not one of them. He speaks from the heart and he knows what the fuck he's talking about. And we had a good chat and by the end of it I was, I was feeling a lot better. And uh, yeah. So when you were filming that movie, were you working out at all? I was doing vanity workouts. I like to run certainly when I'm in a city. So I was running probably three or four days a week of 4.2 mile run. Yes. So as I was running and I was lifting weights a few times a week, you know, biceps and shoulders. Right. You know what I mean? Yeah. The chest, press luck, lots of jazz press, you know what I mean? Eh. And then, um, GSPs coach Jorge Blanco. Do you know Jorge? No, I don't. It's very, very, very good trainer. Uh, Rashad Evans put me onto him whilst I was up there.

Speaker 1:          04:25          I went to see him like two or three times, you know, uh, but no, not, not training as such, but uh, yeah, all worked out. But that exercise, but sometimes that's good anyway. Right? So it gives your body a chance to recover. Well, that's what I said afterwards because I went into that fight feeling so strong, feeling so good. I'm like, cause I, I consistently over trend every single fight in my career apart from that one. Uh, and I said, oh, I'll learn from this. I'll learn from this. And you don't, and it's like Jason Parillo always says, um, it takes confidence to take a day off to rest the body and you know, and now of course there's a fine line between having the confidence to take a day off and being a lazy bastard. And, and I'm going to sit on the couch today, you know, but if you could, if you know, listen, I'm good.

Speaker 1:          05:12          I'm going to take a day or two off cause I need it, you know? So that was one of the mistakes I made with my career. I always trained too much in Jason said, you know, I used to mind fuck myself because it meant so much to me. You know, my fight career meant so much to me. I used to overcomplicate it over analyze you overwork it, stress myself out with it, you know? And uh, that, that was hindering my performances. You know, I never once fought to the, to my ability of what I performed in the gym. Never once. Uh, I remember one day I pulled up outside Ruca the Jason was waiting for me outside and I pulled up and he says, Mike, come here, let me have a quick chat. I said, yeah, what's up? He said, listen, budget go guys in there.

Speaker 1:          05:54          Okay. He said, but you're a fucking world champion. Can you go in there and spar these guys and act like a world champion? They're here. You're up there. Act like it. Don't go in, lose your fucking Tempus Spaz out. Stress out at like a day. Say things you regret. You know, when the spine is not quite necessarily going your way, you, you know, you get a little pissed off or whatever, you know, say Jiu Jitsu coaches catching you and tapping you out a little bit and you start getting a little frustrated. He said, can you just, you know, how can we have none of that place and great advice. Just like when I was fighting for the belt, when I flew home from doing that movie, I went straight to the gym when I landed. And uh, Jason said to me, cause I was always stressed, you know, and he said, listen, um, we don't know if you're going to win this fight mag, you know, fingers crossed, I believe in you.

Speaker 1:          06:44          I believe you're gonna win this fight, but we don't know if you're going to win this fight. So this might be the only time you're ever going to fight for a world title. Right? I said, well, yeah, parcel. But he said, well, let's enjoy the process. You know, let's go through this with a smile on your face. He said, this is huge. He said, you're in a position that everyone wa would kill to be in your fighting for the championship. You're fighting for the belt. You've wanted this whole, this your whole life, enjoy this. You know, and it was such amazing advice cause I was like, yeah, you're right. And I went through the whole thing and the big smile on my face,

Speaker 2:          07:16          you clip Rockhold I remember thinking, Holy Shit, when I see rock holds legs buckle and I see him stagger backwards. I was like, Holy Shit. He got him. And then when he stumbled against the cage and you bashed him and stopped him,

Speaker 1:          07:32          I'm going to help but laugh because it, you know, it does bring a smile to her

Speaker 2:          07:35          almost like I couldn't believe it. It was like a, like a movie. It was like, it was, it was one of those things because you were a big underdog coming to their fight. Everybody know you took it on short notice. Everybody knew that you were working on a movie. And so for you to land that, when you landed that left hand, you missed it once before too. And I remember thinking like, man, that is fucking clothes. Like that's close. Like you saw this opening for that left hand and you, you clipped him over the top of the shoulder. It didn't see it. Common Bang, you drop that left hand on his chin and he see like his eyes roll back and his legs give out. Fuck man.

Speaker 1:          08:07          Well that was the whole plan, the left Hook, you know, Jason and seeing that he was open for that and I'd seen he was open for that and he was even doing this exercise on these bands are like our resistance bands, whatever it was doing this. And his chin was open. His right hand was down at the end of it. And Jason said he's, he's Julian needs moves here and he's finishing here a left hook all day long. And um, you know, he's coming forward and where we're exchanging punches and nothing really significant as Landon. And I just ran out to the body, just whipped the left talk. And you know, as a fire, when you, when you land the good shot you, cause you get the feedback on your fist. There's nothing like it. You know what I mean? When, when you, when you feel that, that solid connection and the knuckles got through the glove, you know, and you feel it, you're like, oh that was a good vibe.

Speaker 1:          08:52          And then we falls down. I'm like, Holy Shit, hold on. And then he gets back up on that, fuck you, boom, back down. And then, uh, he went down and obviously it's got very good Jujitsu and he was kind of sat back against the fence and I thought I've got to be careful not to go in his guard, but uh, yeah, I got the finish. Felt the best feeling I've ever felt in my life was big John Mccarthy's gigantic forearm, nearly pulling my head off my shoulders as he wrestled me off him. But he knew it was over cause I knew it was over. It was great. What did that feel like when you knew you did it? One of the best feelings in the world? One of the best, because, you know, for me the amount of fights I've had is unbelievable, professionally and unprofessionally, you know, and when I was a kid, that's all I was, you know, that that was my only identity has been a fire, you know, and just being that, that guy, you know, unfortunately, rightly or wrongly, wrongly, wrongly, you know, of course it is, you know, I was, I was a fucking idiot when I was a kid.

Speaker 1:          09:52          I was fighting so much, but that's what I clung to, you know, I was a fire and that was the only thing that I could draw pride from, you know, and, uh, be becoming the world champion, knowing that everybody wrote me off knowing that everyone talk shit about me, you know, uh, other fighters just, just, you know, it was everywhere you, he, I heard what people always said about me. Do you know what I mean? So to, to win lie that in style and the first one. Yeah. Yeah. It felt amazing. There it is right there. Oh yeah. Yeah. Rock was very upset. Yeah, he was. Yeah. You know, you talked a lot of shit too and you, and after you beat him, well, well hold on. I know my wife was beyond me there and she deserves a shout out because if it wasn't for her and none of this would've happened, but, uh, with Rockhold with what happened after the fight.

Speaker 1:          10:41          So I, okay, there's a few things that I regret that have heard after the fact. First of all, I'd jump on the fence and I'm just so worried or persecuting up, fuck you, whatever. No big deal. I'm not, I'm not too concerned about that one. Um, and then as I'm doing my lap of victory dance, if you will, um, I do a lap of the octagon and I cross paths with, with Luke part of me and I'm like, Hey, you know, you say whatever you say, unlucky bird, you know, a good fire, whatever. Bubba, Bubba, bubba. I said that. And I carried on having my mom and I was just out of my mind on Adrenalin and just having a great time. And then I found myself, I'd done an entire lap of the octagon again and I was passing him again. So I just thought I'd extended my currency one more time.

Speaker 1:          11:22          I'm like, yeah, you know, and I put my hand out and he said, I already shook your hand. I'm like, oh, really? You're still going to be a decade? Is that yet? I already shook your hand. So then I was like, okay, well now the gloves are off. I said, don't worry about it. You in an octagon, you've just been knocked out. It's okay. You'll figure it out in a minute. Don't worry about it. You'll come to both, you'll be good. So I kind of look like an ass or because people didn't see that he wouldn't, he refused to shake my hand the second time, you know? I was like, well go fuck yourself then. And then when you give me the microphone when you gave it the microphone, I said, the most crude comment I'm at, I've been fighting ever since I care about it. My mother, I'm like, Whoa, that's that an image that I want to portray to the world with a window. Well, belt, you know, what I meant was ever since I've been born. Right. You know, but in, in the moment the word's escaped me a little bit and then I painted a rather disturbing image of my mother giving birth to me. But uh, but yeah. Yeah. I didn't choose my words too carefully though, but uh, yeah, no, it was great man.

Speaker 2:          12:19          Well, you can't be held accountable for that. I mean, that's it. There's no one that's ever going to be able to understand that other than someone who wins the title, no one's gonna know what that felt like. It's impossible eating. It was incredible. He really was. It really was. I can only imagine it was good while it was good. I'm just happy that for you, uh, you know, having a chance to see all your fights and see your career go for as long as it went that you did go out with a title that is,

Speaker 1:          12:45          yeah, for sure. Yeah. You know, I mean, as I say a, that was for me, I'm not sure. Well, I wouldn't have retired. I wouldn't have retired. Yeah, yeah. No, no, because that, cause I, I'd know I could still do it. I can still find now, you know, I can still, but, but the time was right. You know? And then I started having issues with, my goodness.
