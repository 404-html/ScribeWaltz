Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello Freak bitches. You're on a podcast called the legion of skanks. Could that be introduced in a presidential debate? And then I have to go, yes. That was my show. Yes, but you would do it just like that and everybody would start laughing. We're realizing that this just do it like a politician or I'd be like, I repudiated that show years ago. I no longer associate with big Jay Oakerson dude. Speaking of which they put wiener in the pokey today, 21 months in jail for sexting, I believe as a 15 year old. Well, look, I I that guy single handed late probably changed America. Yeah. I mean I really like, yeah, I don't think she really did buy, he changed it through Dick Pics, which, how else were you going to change America in 2017 Anthony Wiener? It gets hard time. Is that the flows? That post is hilarious.

Speaker 1:          00:52          Whoever writes for the post, Damn. They have some fucking great headlines. Anthony Wiener gets hard time. Oh, you know, it's horrible. Is before all this happened, he was fantastic. That guy could have been the president. He was, he had that politician. He thing, I mean, he was he and he was like for a young politician on the fast track, but he, I mean, I really do think Hilary Clinton, I mean I just think it was such a close race that any little thing probably could have made the difference. So you could blame any number of factors. But I mean the FBI coming out and reopening an investigation on you like less than two weeks before an election, that's pretty tough to get over politically. Like in any normal year, any candidate would be buried. But after all that, lock her up, lock her up. There's no way you can survive that.

Speaker 1:          01:38          The FBI's looking into it, all the people that don't want to look into it any further than the surface, they immediately go, oh, we fucking God, it's over. And I'm, you know, like I think there's also just in terms of the politics and the way people work, there was something about Anthony Wiener wear, so it just, it made the American public think about him again. And shrimp was bringing the women who are accusing Bill Clinton of rape to the debates. And I think the average person just kind of went like, wait a minute. So, so your husband is a sexual Predator and your best friend, her husband is also a sexual predator. Like who the fuck are these people? Who the fuck is that the story for? Yeah. Well that's one of the things that got me about Fox News because Fox News has always been the voice of conservative America on television, right?

Speaker 1:          02:27          These staunch verse, The star staunch Voice of conservative America, but yet all this sex stuff comes out like the bill O'Reilly tapes where he was calling up is whoever the girl was and saying crazy shit with a loofah sponge. Remember all that? Yeah, I read about it. It was crazy. But they had recordings of it and then it was, you know, the, all the women that accused him of sexual harassment and the sexual harassment with other people and then other people are sending Dick pics and like, Whoa, you guys are freaks. And you know, it was really crazy about it. Was that. Um, so Roger Ailes, who was the head of the network, he went down first for sexual harassment and then as soon as he was down like a whole bunch of other people started going down and then you really started wondering like, Oh shit.

Speaker 1:          03:13          Like was it just like a new guy isn't letting us sexually harass anymore? What's going on with this shark off? Okay. Well I think it was just, there was a culture that they could get away with before the Internet where they were the bosses and the women were the underlings and they all felt, you know, I'm sure there's probably a lot of dynamics plan there, right? There's a power situation. The man, the, the guy who's the boss is in position. And then there's also women that are attracted to power figures. And then there's also this conservative, like really repressed environment, which always leads to freak shit. It always does. Yeah. And have like people buttoned down. They always lead to freak show. They have to find a way out that pressure's got to go. Yeah, you're right. I mean, I really, I always say to people, if you're in a, if you're in New York City, if you go to a bar in the financial district, like right after work, it's a really crazy seen, something interesting like the exact dynamic you're talking about.

Speaker 1:          04:08          Whereas these people who are all day working in this crazy like this and then like the ties are loosened and it's this like drinking and they take their shoes off at the bar. You're like, whoa. People are getting slapped on the ass. Like crazy shit is going on. But you wouldn't think you're a banker. You know the guy, the guy who runs your retirement. Uh, okay. On, you know why? Because like we were talking about before with like before the podcast or it was like these ancient reward systems. There's an ancient reward system for plundering. I really believe that. I think that these guys feel like their goddamn pirates, like their plundering. Yeah. They're part of the financial market and then they're doing shots. We're going to fucking Jegan. Yeah, yeah. Fucking take them down. They grab each other. We're going to fucking take them down.

Speaker 1:          04:47          We're going to fucking take him down. And if you think about it, I mean if you think about um, the acquisition of property of goods or anything like that throughout human history, I mean the, the idea of like a, just a theory of just acquisition of property. His leg. Yeah. Pretty relatively new. And the way everything was acquired for all of human history was through conquest. Just through, you know, you take it, you take other people's shit. And Uganda think that like a hostile takeover must feel incredibly like sacking the city again. These guys, oh, that's from Wall Street from uh, what's his name? It wasn't Wall Street. What the fuck was this called? A wall. A full Wall Street. Yeah. Yeah. That was a great scene. But people resonate. That scene resonated with people. I'm going to fucking go. I'm not fucking going. And everybody said it's like being above the system kind of ease. But this is tapping in just same way football taps in [inaudible]. It's tapping into this ancient reward system for plundering. Yeah. When men get together and they fuck up other men and take all their shit. And then we kick ass.

Speaker 2:          05:55          Yeah.
