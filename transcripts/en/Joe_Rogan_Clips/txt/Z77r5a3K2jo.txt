Speaker 1:          00:00          I've never seen anything like, um, maybe um, maybe a prime Roy. Yeah. You know, maybe it was different too because it was technically awful. He just had such reflex when they went, that's when he got melted because, because he never, he didn't jab. No, he didn't do anything. Right. Brown took a lead, lead left hawk. What rights from weird angles and it worked cause his reflexes were superhuman. He was superman and then as soon as they deteriorated a little bit and in fighting you can deteriorate a little bit. In baseball you're going to tear. Got Roy would really got Roy my opinion. I'm a giant Roy Jones Jr fan. He's my maybe one of my all time favorite fighters. What really got Roy is when we went up to fight genre wheeze and then he went back down Tarver he was depleted, depleted. And I think when he went up to fight Ruiz, he might've had some Mexican supplements in the system.

Speaker 1:          00:53          Wink, wink, nudge, nudge. Sure. Yeah. I mean he was like 200 and plus pounds overweight or something. Look good. I think he should have retired after that one. Well, he definitely should have consulted with an endocrinologist to try to figure out what, how his system was. And then the weight cut down to one 75 must have been brutal cause he was smooth. He looked like shit. He lost all his muscle tone. He just didn't, he looked like, and he was shredded in the 90s exactly. Yeah. He looked like a guy who's system had been shut down with the thing that these guys don't maybe don't recognize if they take some shit or if they, you know, even if you just cut too much weight, your body stops producing hormones. Sure. Your body is all fucked up. You're on, you're on your way to die. Your body is telling you what the fuck are you doing now?

Speaker 1:          01:38          So if he was 200 plus pounds when he fought Ruiz, then he has to cut down to one 75 30. Yeah. And who knows how sophisticated his methods were. I mean, some fighters today are amazing at doing that. I mean, they know how to do it correctly. They know how to rehydrate correctly. And boxing at least has the, um, the benefit of not having Usada in place like the UFC does. The UFC has a real problem with a lack of Ivs and these guys can't rehydrate correctly or the way that they want to. It is dangerous. It is dangerous. But in their defense, it's, it's also a way that they can detect a whether or not someone's cheating. Okay. Cause when they're using ivs, you can mask a lot of shit. Right? Yeah. I didn't think about that. Yeah. That's why they do it. Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:25          Yeah. They just won't let you do it. So when, I don't know what happened with Roy when he did put it in. You're not, can't take anything away from Tarver either. Cause Tarver almost beat Roy the first time you fought, but then fucked him up second fucking fluids head. Yeah. And the famous words, any excuses died, Roy, right before they fight you. Anything like that? He was so confident. I don't think he gets his due either. No, he doesn't. He doesn't. He, uh, he had some great wins. He had some great wins. Um, he's still at it too, right? [inaudible] something like 46, 47 he got popped for steroids. Yeah. So, well Duh. If you're 45 and he's still looking good, there's something going on. The only, the only person I truly believe in, I realize you'll, you'll think I'm biased because of where I'm from, but I don't think Bernard ever did anything.

Speaker 1:          03:15          I don't think you did anything either. Bernard just lives clean and I've seen him, uh, order grilled chicken and get chicken that was fried by accident and peel the fry off of it rather than just go, oh, just this once. I'll do it. Right. Watched him take it off to just, you know what I mean? To not eat that. It's just insane. Dietary in the gym, you know, I agree. But the Joe Smith fight was sad to watch. Of course. That was, that was, uh, the Kovalev fight was sad. I was ringside man. I love Kovalev but it's, you know, affiliate legend like, ah man, this is rough. You know, it's crazy to see how deep into his career he was still successful. Like, I wrote a blog article about the Kelly Pavlik fight cause I'm like, I don't remember how old he was at the time, but everybody had already written them off.

Speaker 1:          04:05          My brother and I were there like Publix is going to beat the dog shit I've been on. And he gave him a fucking lesson lesson. He put on a clinic where people have to realize he was technically passed. His fight is primary fucked up. Tito Trinidad. It was 36 yeah, that's, it was 36 and 2001 that was two weeks after nine 11 that fight and he was 36 that how crazy is that? Yeah. What was he when he fought Joe Smith? 50 50 maybe. Maybe 51 definitely 50 crazy. So he was, he, I say he lasted 15 years longer than, than the average guy, you know. Well how about when he came back and boxed Roy Junior? Yeah. Well Roy, when Roy beat him the first time it was beaten him with all those reflexes and then when the reflex is slid off, clearly I'll with just fundamentals.

Speaker 1:          04:54          Yes, perfect. Mccann's Roya didn't have them. He didn't have them. Yeah, just relying on what was once there. Yeah, but it wasn't, he was a shell of him for his, of his former itself. Well, it was also the Glen Johnson fight was a scary knock out. He was on Queer Street. Yeah. Well he was just flatlined and astral traveling after the got knocked out by Tarver. Yeah. Then there was not that much time in between those two fights. No, it was just, it was the next fight. Yeah. Yeah, and he and that, those knockouts where you are, you're out on your feet before you hit the ground and your head hits the canvas, which is two shots and he was stiffened up. It was sad to watch. It was. It was. That was really, I thought that was going to be the end to me too. And then he started fighting like in Russia, sanctioned over there. And he's a Russian citizen. Yes ma'am. Bizarro world Russian pussy involved.

Speaker 1:          05:44          He's got to have some total over there, man, to do that. When you're talking about Larry Holmes. I looked up his Wikipedia. His last fight was in 2002 butter bean is 51 or so, and he put it on butter bean 10 round fight. That's crazy. And Corey Potter being can crack that big motherfucker hit hard. Hard. But Larry, just that snake, that snake and I, you're not getting through that. Yeah. Pop. Every time he tries to come in and bunk. I remember that when due to where those golden Palestine was the first person he did it and the Tito fight man. It was that the first, yeah. Yeah. That was so weird. Someone did it in the UFC too. They wore that shit on their back. It's odd. Yeah. Put it on your trunk. So you're going to do it, I guess. Wow. You don't get as much money, but it's, it is. I Know Bernard got 50 k to put on his back and he bet on himself against Tito real. Yeah. And you know, he was a huge underdog. Everyone dial. Everyone thought Tito was gonna whoop his ass. Everyone. Everyone there wasn't. You know, I was jumping off my brother's couch.

Speaker 1:          06:46          Yeah. He fucked him up. Yeah, man. Yeah. Bernard was a special athlete. He really was absolutely special fight all time. Great. For sure. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. And it was interesting because I used to watch him when he was in his thirties and he would complain about crooked promoters and all these things. And my thought was, man, it's too bad. This guy like missed his prime. Right. And then he did what he did and then he did what he did after the after, cause he got, he was in jail for like strong arm robbery and got out and Kinda like wallowed in obscurity. And then his shot was that Roy fight, you know, and I, and we were like, Oh, you got your shot. I guess that's it. Yeah. It just got better and better with age. Just show man. It's like the rarest thing in anything.
