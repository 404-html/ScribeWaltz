Speaker 1:          00:00          We really do need to get back to some kind of productive discussion, productive politics where the far right disowned near lunatics and we disown are lunatics and we get back to work about whatever the ocean's plastic, whatever it is that we're talking about, because right now the discourse is corrupted it. We're not doing what we need to do in the academies. These people are continuing to pump out this nonsense that's totally untethered to reality. It's a huge problem. I'm sick of it. You're sick of it. We're all sick and we're sick of, I'm sick of it. I've had it. I've had it with these folks. It just doesn't seem, it doesn't seem like it's sustainable. It's it. It's, it seems like some weird,

Speaker 2:          00:42          it's going to run out of energy towards eating itself constantly eats itself like we did. The thing about the people of color and the black indigenous people of color that they fragmented. You see when you get into the critical race literature that it's like, okay, so you're brown or you're black, but you have slightly lighter skin, slightly darker skin, slightly darker than that. Really dark. They have different levels of privilege and it's just cutting things apart. The idea though that this is going to create some kind of a coalition that can then defeat, you know, the plurality or something like that is ridiculous. So what do you see? You see this stuff's starting to blow up. You see the Democrats bleed seats, they've lost like a thousand legislative seats across the u s since Obama got elected in Oh eight how are you going to get your agenda if you don't have any legislators, if you don't have anybody elected.

Speaker 2:          01:27          And so then what happens? 2016 I can't say that the reason that Trump got elected, because there's lots of reasons it had something to do. No, I will say I had something to do with this because every conservative person I know that's not just a reactionary is like, and I live in the south east man. I know some conservatives, most of my friends are conservatives, cause I don't have a choice if I, if I want to have friends that they're going to be conservatives who lives there. So I talked to them and they're like, Oh yeah, they're tearing down this kind of statue. Oh yeah. It's tough. And it's not like they're tearing down confederate statues are talking 10 on Thomas Jefferson. You know? It's like there. George Washington, George Washington. Halloween's a problem. Then I didn't know. You didn't know how his problem, what are you going as for Halloween? I'm a shark. You're a shark. My kids are mermaids. My problematic. Oh God. If they're mermaids and you're a shark, you're definitely taking like a dominant and power position. Power. They pick my outfit. I don't pick my outfit. I have kids. Oh, they tell me what I am. That's an issue, but I don't know. I'll try to figure out a paper for it.
