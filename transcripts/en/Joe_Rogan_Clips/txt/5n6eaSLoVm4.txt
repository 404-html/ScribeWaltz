Speaker 1:          00:00          And apps. So this weekend is Darren till versus Wonderboy. Excuse me, versus Tyron Woodley. Why don't I say versus Wonderboy? We'll kind of flip was that, and you know why? Cause it was reading a article of this really interesting article about Wonderboy and his last three fights, the two fights with Tyron Woodley that were super duper close. And then one fight with Darren till that was also really close. And they were talking about like how, um, if you looked at it on paper, the people from outside, I think they were there were saying that global scorecard, I think that's how they're describing it, meaning how people scored it, like on average around the world. Uh, more people gave it to Wonderboy then gave it to Darren till. And the same thing happened with, um, the Tyron Woodley fights. I feel like the decisions were right in all those fights.

Speaker 1:          00:47          I feel like I'm in the woods. He fights in particular with the hurt Wonderboy. Wonderboy didn't really hurt with the, I think that counts for more. It just does. Woodley, Tyron Woodley had him out. I mean, he had, I'm really hurt. And Wonderboy never had Tyron in that kind of trouble in either one of those fights. So I would, I would give that advantage clearly to tire and I would think that if he lost that fight that wouldn't make it any sense. Cause fights are supposed to be about who does the most damage, who of WHO's more effective. I mean Wonderboy was effective for more time, but that's just like movement and sticking and hitting him, hitting him with small shots. But tyrin put him on, you know, unconsciousness his door. He was like right there. It was very dangerous. It was way different. And plus you got the impact.

Speaker 1:          01:32          Yeah. I said, well I don't know. I'm not sure. I believe that. I think, you know, if someone really wins a decision, they really wanted decision, but it's just what's most important is damage. If you, you guys are basically in a striking exchange. We're not talking about like submission attempts versus striking exchanges. Like which one's better? He almost had him choked out with that triangle. Well he almost had them knocked out that left hook. We're not talking about that because it was basically just a striking match and in just as plain old striking match, Willie was the one who landed the biggest shots in my mind. We've got to figure out a way to quantify that. It just doesn't make any sense. Well, you could see a guy having a guy fucked up and almost out to, I think the same way about the Robert Whitaker Yoel Romero fight.

Speaker 1:          02:14          There's two rounds in that fight where Yoel Romero is land in bombs on Whitaker. Whitaker is hurt bad. How does he lose that fight? I don't understand that. It doesn't make, to me, even if it makes sense in the current scoring system, that scoring system is fucking flawed. That shit doesn't make any sense. Like logically when you're looking at what is the, what's the ultimate goal of fighting. But if you look at those three fights, just at least on paper, Wonderboy is like right up there and Darren till with one fight with cowboy one fight with him. Those two fights with their most high profile fights of his career. Boom already got a title shot. It's really interesting. That's how, that's how talented Darren Tillis people are so interested in him. 17 to know. 25 years old, they're like, fuck, give him a chance. The real battle for this guy almost is not just the fight, which is going to be of course a battle, but making 170 and how much longer does he do that?

Speaker 1:          03:11          He's, I mean he fucking, he's hurting to get down to one 70 apparently he was at one 82 yes, he's giant dude. Giant. You'll see how much bigger he is in Woodley. This is the video at the press conference when I stand next to each other. And how tall is it till puts his hands over his head. I can't tell. It says inches. He's gotta be six too. But he said a big giant six to six foot either. That's just six foot, even 72 inches. That's right. It is. He seems way taller than that. Yeah, watch the go to the video of them. That's crazy. Why don't think he was six to, anyway, just still, we're talking one 70 his clearly taller. He's a big fucker too. It's not just tall. He's thick. You know, he's a, he's a big fucking guy and he has a hard time making that weight. Look how fucking big is dude. Seriously.

Speaker 1:          04:07          That looks like more than three inches. Unless he's wearing some crazy cowboy boots on and, no, but look, it's going to be hard to do anything that Woodley man. Very hard. Hard. Well, there's a bunch of things with wood and the, first of all, the fucking speed you're dealing with speed that you, you probably haven't seen before. Exactly. And that his level of wrestling, look at these two guys he doesn't want to listen to, isn't, there's no submitting until, I mean, he knows Jujitsu for sure. He lived in Brazil for a few years. He actually speaks, speaks Portuguese. Oh Shit. Okay. Yeah. Um, he got stabbed in London and then, uh, went to Brazil to fucking recoup and hi and hang out and lived there for awhile. I don't know the full story of it, but he speaks perfect Portuguese after one of his fights in Brazil, he addressed the crowd in Portuguese, was pretty crazy.
