Speaker 1:          00:00          He still has his youtube account and he's still able to, you know, the, with some, one of the things that we're seeing with d platforming is it's sort of a cascading effect. So Domino's, Twitter takes you down and then Facebook takes you down a guy, not limbo but some other right wing or that got like a said some shit. And then Gavin McInnes, they taught boys, guy took him off of everything. Yeah, he's off everything. Yeah. Yeah. And that's, that's that. And with him it's even, what was he, he's like a hate speech guy, isn't he? He's like fucking inciting violence and whatever. He definitely did incite violence in that he wanted these proud boys to fight against Antifa and he felt like the Antifa people were thugs and that they showed up at conservative events and they threatened violence. And then he wanted the proud boys to fight them.

Speaker 1:          00:51          I actually had him on my podcast long before any of this shit went down when I didn't even know what the fuck the proud boys was. And I was asking him, I knew him as the cofounder of vice and I know knew him as what I would basically say is he, he was essentially, who's a shit talker. He's a provocateur. He was a clever provocateur and it was kind of a funny guy. Like he came the last time he came to the show, he was dressed like Michael Douglas from falling down. He had the fucking briefcase and everything and the crazy tie and yeah, I mean he's doing, but he did it on purpose. He said he's dressing like Michael Douglas from falling down. Like he's, he's a guy who would trick people into coming in and talking with him on his youtube channel and they thought that he was liberal or progressive and then he would, you know, he would basically talked him into a corner and slash or Barry Cohen, that shit or leg in a way.

Speaker 1:          01:45          Yeah, he was doing a lot of that and there was some of those very clever I was doing on his youtube channel. Then he got into this whole proud boys thing and we, there's a video you can watch the bizarre origins of the proud boys from a podcast that I did with Anthony Kumina from opie and Anthony and he explains how the proud boys initially, we're just a joke. It's, it's uh, it was literally a joke and they did it to make fun of a guy that was one of the, was he one of their interns? I think so. It sounds, yeah. Yeah. It's kind of a crazy story, Matt. And then that shit took a real life of its own and now they're fucking junior ticket K of, exactly. That's crazy. They, they be, they all of a sudden it got away from him and they became an organization where you could just join.

Speaker 1:          02:30          So all these people join and then they act as a proud boy and they were beating people up and all this other crazy shit. And he doubles down on set. He got out, he quit. He denounced his position and he realized that his life is falling apart. He's being labeled as, you know, he, they falsely claim the FBI labeled them as a hate crime, but they didn't. But the southern poverty law center did label them as a hate crime and suffered several other organizations it as well. But the southern poverty law center, they've had some pretty crazy shit that they've said as well. Okay. There are a serious, a liberal progressive organisation that occasionally oversteps the boundaries of logic and reason they, but he, what he did was start an organization and I had a joke about about vegans. My joke about vegans was the problem with vegans is a problem with any other group.

Speaker 1:          03:19          If you get a group of a hundred people, what are the odds that one of them is going to be a fucking idiot? Right? Well that's 100% right. If we're being like really charitable, one out of a hundred is a fucking moron. So if you get a group like vegans were just, anyone can join and you have, there's 300 million people in this country, that means there's 3 million fucking idiots. That's generous. And a lot of them are Vegan. And this, this, the joke was that the problem is not the actual people with good ethics and morals don't want animals to suffer. The problem is you let a bunch of people with no identity join your gang and then they become a part of this plant based gang. This is same thing with the proud boys. I think some of them probably went into it thinking it was a goof and they were going to go there and they thought these Antifa assholes, these 90 pound dork swinging bike locks at people and calling everybody a Nazi and a fascist and trying to shut down every single conservative speech there was at any, any sort of university.

Speaker 1:          04:20          These people were preposterous. They were called Ben Shapiro and Nazi, he's a fucking Jewish man. Where's a Yamaka? I mean, it's crazy to call him a Nazi is completely insane. But he's the conservative. They all right. And they'll all left almost, right? Yes, exactly. And so their idea was to have something that would be there to balance out the alt left and it got out of control and so he denounced it and he stepped away from it. Pulled with, but it's too late because he's now what you said. See, you don't know him, but you said he's the hate speech guy. You said he's that guy that, hey, that's how everybody's going to see him. So if you found out your sister was dating him, you'd be like, what? You're dating hate speech guy? Like that's who he is. And he's like, no, no, no, no.

Speaker 1:          05:03          He's not that. It's like it got away from him. It just, it became this, it wasn't him anymore. With all these people that joined that were actual racist, too late. It doesn't matter too late. There's no room for that in this world. I'm out the game. Yeah. Yeah. So any, all these other groups hat, once he started getting deep platformed, these other groups got pressure to deep platform him because they said, hey, you keep the hate speech guy. You're telling me the hate speech guys on Youtube. And they're like, fuck, okay, we got to take them off. And so that this domino effect does seem to take place. So with this Sargon of a cod thing though, it doesn't seem to be taking place with him because people are examining what he said and they're saying, well this is a sloppy use of these words.

Speaker 1:          05:46          It's not wise what he did, but I do not think he's a racist. And I don't think he was promoting racism. What he was doing was he was using words poorly off a week. But yeah, I mean that's what he's guilty of. But that's the, I mean that's a, that's a good sign. He's not being deep platform. Then if like, like if people are taking a beat to realize like, like, oh, I don't hate gays and blacks. Like that's, that's the point that the whole, this whole thing has been a lesson in patience and that's good to hear that like this guy is being afforded some patients about, but in their defense, he's already been kicked off Twitter. [inaudible] he'd been kicked off of Twitter before. I don't know what for though. Do you know what he got kicked off of Twitter for? He got kicked off Twitter previously, so he already had that scarlet mark. You know, there was already, people are already looking at him. I mean, he's been in articulate on Twitter before. No Way.

Speaker 1:          06:44          I don't know what he had done. He had, they had determined that he had harassed somebody. What's that? This could be a new account, I guess to, he's on it right now. Is it a new account? Might be how many followers does he have? 13,000 yeah. That's probably knew you had a lot more than that. He must've, uh, I'm wonder if you started a new account permanently banned account. Let's see. Yeah, he's permanently banned. April of 27. Oh, so it's pretty old. That funny. April of 2017 is millions of years ago now. The news cycle is so fast. It's too fast. It's weird, right? It's, it's, dude, I'm telling you, when I was at the shows, like a story would be hot Monday morning and then Tuesday morning I was like, what happened? No one gives a shit.
