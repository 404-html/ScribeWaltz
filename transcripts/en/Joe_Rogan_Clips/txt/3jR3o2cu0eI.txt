Speaker 1:          00:00          And, uh, is, say what you want about Giuliani who now is bat shit crazy. Uh, what happened with him? I don't know. I think there's some blew a fuse. He's not respectable anymore. It's like some kind of, well, he aligned himself a Trump, so that immediately gets you put into a category. But he's also a little, I think he's got some dementia going on. Like he just doesn't seem right, but it is. Hm. Losses comb over that he had a comb over for, what is that like, uh, what's his name with the comb over and he realized, Oh my God, I'm fucking crazy. Samson's hair. It's like that. He, he lost the last wisps, those last wisps of comb-over that he'd had during nine 11 going on. Yeah. He was at one point, you know, after nine 11, they call it nine, 10, 2001, he was a piece of shit.

Speaker 1:          00:48          No one liked Giuliani. He ruined New York. He ruined it by commercializing it, cleaning up all the porn theaters, uh, uh, getting rid of the tunnel bunnies and the squeegee guys. Like he went on a tear, just gave the police department carte blanche to start racking head and taking care of business. He cleaned up New York Times Square, turned into a Disney type atmosphere instead of that drug addled fucking mess that it was. And, and people hated him for kind of ruining that Gritty New York that we saw in taxi driver and shit. And then nine 11, he was America's mayor. That's what they called him, America's mayor. He's going out of Yankee Games and to ovations and people he's standing with the comb over. He looked so crazy person on the right. Yeah. Yeah. She is totally shaved his head. I said, listen bro, there's a lot of power in just shaving your head, motherfucker.

Speaker 1:          01:42          Yeah. You feel good. You feel like a guy who has like hair on the side of his head. Unless you do a lot of drugs like hunter s Thompson, it's hard, right? You can't pull that off, I think. Yeah. Uh, who does it offer? Right hand side. That's a, that's a comb over in the beginning. They are above that. Above that. Above that to the right to the right with a suit. Oh yeah. That's where it's first started. That's the full clover. Oh my God, look at that. Oh, it's working the back. What did he do? Did he try to get plugs or something in the front? I don't think so. I don't know what that is. It's just, it was rocking that full strong comb over that is, uh, he, uh, he had a lot to do with the, the, the um, getting rid of organized crime in New York City, like the mafia, the five families, all that shit was still running pretty rampant throughout the seventies and eighties.

Speaker 1:          02:34          Uh, as a kid, me and my brother used to laugh our asses off. We'd open the newspaper and there was like Johnny the horse boldly. Yachty was found dead and we be laugh our asses off at the names, just those, those mob names. It's, it's hilarious. And that scene in Goodfellas at the beginning when they're just going through and you know, the nose and killer and this guy and they all have those fucking names that are hilarious. And a, yeah. Giuliani was a big part of that. I'm surprised they didn't kill him. Like he was absolutely responsible. He kept going after them and kept putting them away. Uh, with the, you know, the new Rico statutes that they had and a locked up a lot of mobsters, man. So, well, you know, another problem with the mom says they started writing, I mean other, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:20          As soon as you start ratting on each other all year, mystique is gone. Your whole legend has gone. Just the whole thing is that you guys have Omerta you keep your fucking mouth shut. You do your time like a man, right. You get out and you're a hero and that this whole thing keeps going. This thing of ours was, but those fucking pussies didn't want to go to jail. Isn't that something like the old school guys would be offered, you know, you could walk. Yep. Or You could get a really easy sentence, just talk, Oh fuck your mother. And, and then, yeah, they reached a point where it's like, yeah, I, I'm not built for prison. When they would put them in prison though, it was like in Goodfellas. Right. They would be able to cook and they paid the guards off at a sweet set up. The internet ruined all that too.

Speaker 1:          04:05          Yeah. Yeah. You wanna well, it was probably all dead before the Internet, but, but you know, like Sammy the bull Gravano he was free. He did his time, did the minimal amount of time. He killed at least 10 people. They mean pa, he, he confessed to them, you know, talked about the, that he did and how he did them. He wanted it got so bad. They want to, God, he's so bad. I mean, Sammy the bull Gravano was a fucking straight up psychopath. Yeah. That's total serial killer. And they let him walk and then he got arrested eventually for selling ecstasy in Phoenix. He moved to Phoenix after that. Yeah. Yeah. And then he, uh, was running shit down there. And how did he just not get whacked out? Like was the mob was gone. They all were gone. There's no one cared. Hated it at all. It all crumbled at that something.

Speaker 1:          04:54          Yeah, just like a, yeah. Poof. Went away. The thing that like, God, he was the first one that was like real flashy and public about it. They didn't like that Vincent the Chin always used to walk around like a crazy person in the bathroom. It was nuts. But he would, he would give people directions while he was doing that, but he felt like everything was being bugged. So they would do is they bug cars along his walking route. They could record him. Oh, that is hilarious. What he was doing. Jesus. There's always a way. Yeah. There's always a way to get you. Yeah. The mystique was gone though. Yeah. It wasn't really like the Russians still have the mystique Russian mobsters. They are brutal. Tells Gary Ones like they are the scary ones. There's, there's everyone's now worst smile because regardless of what it turned into, there was a time where the Italian mob did have a line.

Speaker 1:          05:46          Like you didn't cross family, things like that. Uh, but the Russians, all my God, will they fuck up an entire family? The dog. Everything gets in the worst way. Yeah. They're scary. Scary mother fuckers. I had a, an experience, I'm out. It was a Broadway, I guess. Uh, and they have those peddle cabs that go around and they were all Russian dudes, big kind of legs on him. And they peddle around and I was looking for a cab or real cab to take me downtown. I wasn't gonna ride 15 blocks in a tricycle, uh, with a Uri peddling in front of me. So, uh, this guy pass by once and said, you need the cab. I was like, Nah, I'm good. Thanks. Comes around again. I'm still waiting for a cab. And he goes, cab. And I was like, I'm not going to have you pedal me 15 fucking blocks.

Speaker 1:          06:34          No move. And, and you could yell at a cab driver in New York. They'll yell out your window and stuff. They'd rarely, we'll get out of their car. They know, you know, you've got the medallion right there. You could just call the number and say you were being harassed by a cab driver. So they won't do anything. This guy gets off his fucking bike, you'll have a fucking problem, you have fucking problem. And I was just like, oh shit. It's going down black eye. This guy means business. And of course I'm like, no, no, all good. All good. Thank you. I don't need a a cab. You'll write the mother fuck. And that was it. But you don't fuck with Russia? No, they're not regular white people. No, they're not.
