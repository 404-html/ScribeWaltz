Speaker 1:          00:00          That's the ideological point that right here, this is a new thing though, right? I mean, relatively speaking, this, uh, this hard nose stance from the left of the equality of outcome and, and the only reason why there wouldn't be 50% women or 50% black or 50% in it, you just pick any marginalized group. The only reason why it wouldn't be even across the board with all other races is because of discrimination. This is a fairly new stance. And then there were, there were moments that were fairly well publicized that I don't forget when Larry Summers got fired from Harvard. So let Larry Summers with the president of Harvard and he's a famous economist, uh, and he gave a speech for which he was fired. Uh, there might be a little more color as to why he was fired. I mean, it was more fire because he, he wants the wheels started to come off.

Speaker 1:          00:46          He didn't, he had alienated enough people that he didn't have friends to kind of prop him up. But, but the thing that pulled the wheels off was that he gave a speech and he said, we know there are are differences in, in the the bell curves that describe, you know, mathematical aptitude between men and women. And this explains why there are many more top flight male mathematicians and engineers than women. And it's not that they even, it's not that the, uh, the means of the, uh, the, the, the of the bell curves are different. So the, the means could be the same, but there could be more variants so that the tails are thicker in the case of, of the male bet. Bell-Curve. So at the, at the absolute ends, both the, that, the, the low end and the high end, you have many more people.

Speaker 1:          01:31          So you know, if you're, if you're going to ask, you know, what's the, in the same size population, how many people do you have at the 99.9, nine, nine, nine percentile of aptitude in math? Say it could be that you have, and there's, there's a fair amount of data to show this many more men at the tails than women. Right? And, and that's true for grandmasters in chess, right? It's just, it's just this is not a, uh, and it may be true for something like, you know, playing pool, you know, I mean they're, they're, they're just differences. And that may not be entirely environmental, almost certainly are not entirely environmental. Uh, that is one, right? It's a big issue in the world of pool men and women play separately and there's no reason physically why they should. Yeah, they're not, it's not a strength game.

Speaker 1:          02:17          Right. But women are allowed to play in men's tournaments, but they never win. Right. Jean Bill Lucas was a woman who was, uh, she was like one of the only women never compete and beat men. She's like an extreme outlier. And this was like, I want to say it was in the late seventies and eighties. And other than that, there's been a few women that have done well in tournaments, but when they come to major league professional pool tournament's, they're almost always one by men. Um, and when I say almost, I mean like 99.9%. So there was a commonwealth games have been happening as we, it was just over the last couple of weeks and there was a male to female transgender athlete in the weight lifting. Consequently, that's a whole nother ball participated in the women's competition and the Commonwealth Games at the time of her joining hadn't yet put down a rule as to testosterone levels in the females competing.

Speaker 1:          03:12          And so this male to female transgender person qualified in the female games and was as you'd expect, um, winning in all of the Games and was the front runner and destined to win the competition as a male to female transgender person. And the only reason, and it would have led to a huge crisis in the Commonwealth Games because there was some resistance to this notion. Um, and of course the questions that arise is this fair. Um, men are born naturally with high levels of testosterone. For example, the only reason it didn't lead to, to crunch time, and that was a huge scandal of, of, uh, of her winning is that she injured herself in the competition. And by sheer accident, I saw that. Well, I can, I can expand on that a little bit because I've actually gone through this extensively because there was a woman who was a, used to be a man, was competing in mixed martial arts against women and just beating the shit out of them.

Speaker 1:          04:03          And I was saying that this is, this is a mistake and that you're, you're looking at something whether someone should be legally able to identify as a woman portray themselves a woman. Absolutely. Yeah. Do you have the freedom to become a woman in quotes? In our society, yes, but you can't deny biological nature and there's physiological advantages to the male frame. There's, it's specifically when it comes to combat sports. That's my wheelhouse. I'm an expert. I understand there's a giant difference between the amount of power that a man and a woman can generate. And if you're telling me that a guy living 30 years of his life as a man, that's, that's essentially like a woman being on steroids for 30 years, then getting off and then having regular women being forced to compete with her and try to pretend that this is a level playing field.

Speaker 1:          04:50          It is not. There's a difference in the shape of the hips, the size of the shoulder, the density of the bones, the size of the fists. Yeah. That's a giant factor. And your ability to generate power is the size of your fists. It's also an ethical problem. And it's not just a competition here. Girls getting beaten up by someone who used to be a man. Yes. But people came down on me harder than anything that I've ever stood out for in my life. Never in my life that I think there's going to be a situation where I said, hey, I don't think a guy should be able to get his penis removed and beat the shit out of women. And then people are like, you're out of line. But that's the summary of the [inaudible]. What happened? This is a conversation that I had with a woman, uh, online as well during this whole thing.

Speaker 1:          05:33          Uh, she said she, this person who had turned into a woman has always been a woman. And I said, but she was a man for 30 years. She goes, no, she's always been a woman. I go even when she had sex with a woman and fathered a kid and she says, yes, even then I go, well, we're done because you're just talking Nazi ideology can, that's ideology covering Zap. The fat, so as they are is that she had a male physique and the person who was arguing with me wants to claim this moral high ground of being the most progressive and they're always looking to step on top of anybody who's less progressive than then and complain and and proclaim superiority and this is the ideological sport. This is the idea support that that you see with when people are playing ping pong with our ideas and not listening.

Speaker 1:          06:18          You need to listen to experts in, in that when you're, especially when you're talking about martial arts, there's a, the the, the difference is so profound and the results are so critical because you're talking about a sport where the objective goal, the goal is clear. It's very clear. Beat the fuck out of the other person in front of you. So anything that would give you an advantage in beating the fuck out of that person should be really looked at very carefully and not thrown through the the lens of this progressive ideological filter that we're going through right now. Because that's, that's what it is. I mean, that's how people are looking at it and it's with weightlifting as well. When transgendered athletes going to weightlifting competitions, the male to female transgender athletes are overwhelmingly dominant. Yeah. I mean, is this, is this a coincidence or it's, no, it's someone who had fucking testosterone pumping through their system and n and a y chromosome their whole life and now all of a sudden we're supposed to say no, she's a woman.

Speaker 1:          07:15          She's a, she's dainty, she's got size 14 feet, she's got gorilla hands. Like, what in the fuck are we doing? So I think as you said earlier, she is a woman, but for the purposes of competition against other women, you know, legally she's a woman at that stage, right? If she goes through that identity transition. But I think we have to recognize it. I think even many traditional feminists are making this point much to the anger of the Trans Community. They're saying, hold on you what you're doing in this way. He's actually, we fought so hard and so long for these female spaces where we have a space of our own people that used to be men are coming into those spaces is actually quite literally beating the crap out of us. Yes, yes. You know, whether it's in boxing, uh, whether it's in weightlifting, in martial arts, they are, by definition, they're dominating on this.

Speaker 1:          08:04          Of course they offer, what were the reasons you've said experts that they're calling upon are all malls, all transitioned doctors, surgeons or people that have transitioned themselves when they speak to actual board certified endocrinologist. And some of the only do it off record, but one of 'em, um, I forget her name, she was in one of the big mixed martial arts publications. Ramona [inaudible] I believe is her name. She's saying, no, not only does it, it, it actually doing this transition, like from male to female, you're forcing your, you're putting estrogen into the system. So the bone density change that would ordinarily take place if you remove someone's testicles and stop that does the production of testosterone, estrogen preserves bone density, so you're actually retaining the male bone density. There's so many problems with this and that, and then the one of the other things they say, well, oh, the Olympics, the Olympics allow it.

Speaker 1:          09:00          The Olympics are very ideologically based. There's not a whole lot of science to this, this transition thing of allowing male to female athletes to compete in the Olympics and there's a extreme amount of corruption in the Olympics as it is with the IOC being in bed with Wada, the world anti-doping agency and the way they handle this Russian scandal. I mean this is Russian scandal that was highlighted in that fantastic documentary. ICARUS, yeah, they're fucking crazy. They're the Olympics or not to be trusted. That is a gigantic multibillion dollar business where the athletes get paid zero money. It is inherently corrupt from the top down. No doubt about it. So to to call upon them is to see who should be competing as a woman. Fuck off. They, they, they're not the experts. This is, this is not something that's been examined and this is coming from someone who, one of my jobs is examining and commentating on fights.

Speaker 1:          09:53          That is a big part of what I do. I understand fights and I know what it looks like when a man's beating the shit out of a woman. And that's what it looked like when this person was fighting women. It was, there was a massive physical advantage. Massive and not a skill advantage. What was the way you mentioned something that the reaction that you got to that, what was the trouble you go to the top? People are so mad at me. I mean it was just so many. Not only that, they took my words out of context, they quoted all these different, uh, gender transition doctors. It's saying that there's no science behind this and the science behind it being totally fair and totally equal. It's just not, and people know it. Everyone knows they couldn't put cris Cyborg against this guy and give him a run for his money the wrong way class.

Speaker 1:          10:33          Or that's the other way. That's the other thing, and we're dealing with a similar situation like that in Texas. I don't even know about the girl who was, she was born a girl. She's transitioning to a boy in high school taking testosterone, but in Texas they only allow her to compete as a girl. So she's dominated the Texas state wrestling championship two years in a row and it's horrific because she's on steroids. She's on testosterone. He now doesn't matter because they're testing chromosomal. Yeah, she's a woman. She was born a woman, right? She was born a girl. So because the fact that she's transitioning to be a boy, they don't give a shit. You're a woman. You're not going to wrestle against men. You're a girl. You're not going to wrestle, wrestle against boys. So they have allowed her under extreme protest and it's terrible.

Speaker 1:          11:15          She wants to compete or he, I should say, wants to compete as a boy. They won't let him. They say, no, you were born a girl. You have to compete as a girl. So when he competes everybody booze, it's offer. It's fucking awful. I mean it's, it's, it's really devastating. A question for you that way around if it's female to male transition, uh, somebody that used to be a woman that transitions to a man and wants to compete with the men, they don't have an advantage to tone. No, they don't allow to write. They're at a disadvantage. If they win in that context, they've actually done really good. Yes. Look, women can beat men. Yeah. I mean it happens all the time at Jujitsu. There's, especially in Jujitsu in particular because it's such a technique based art. Uh, but it is possible. There's, there's also a woman named Jermaine Duran to me who's a worldclass mixed martial artists whose multiple time world Moy Thai champion of Fatah man and knocked them out.

Speaker 1:          12:05          It's crazy video. A real man Kao them when the straight right it's, it is possible for them to win if their skill level is so far superior that it overcomes the inherent strength advantages. But a woman to male transition would be at a severe disadvantage against a natural male. Would you be so in that Texas case, they clearly have it wrong. They should. They should allow him to, to compete with this and would you be, whereas I can, I think all three of us probably instinctively would resist the notion that a female than a male to female athlete competes with other females because they'd have it. One can resist that. Yes. Would you be for a female to male athlete competing with men? Yes, because I don't think there's no honor. There's no event. But here's the problem and the, and the consent is sort of running in the other direction.

Speaker 1:          12:52          The marriage, she is continually putting herself or he's putting himself in harm's way knowingly. And I'm not opposed to a woman fighting a man if she so chooses. Like I'm not opposed to bull riding if you want it. I'm not lobbying to get bull riding outlawed, but if you want to be so fucking stupid that you climb on top of a 2000 pound angry animal, go for it. And you should be able to do whatever you want. I think you should be able to jump out of fairly good air on airplanes. Know, if you want to parachute, you should be able to risk your life. Parachuting. The difference lies in just massive advantages and that there's a massive advantage in transitioning from male to female, female to male. Here's the other problem. Female to Male, you have to take testosterone. You can't legally take testosterone and compete.

Speaker 1:          13:36          It's been a giant issue in mixed martial arts because for the longest time there was a loophole and the loophole was testosterone therapy and they were allowing testosterone replacement therapy for male athletes that were either older or it's, it was, uh, it was a symptom of having pituitary gland damage, which comes from head trauma, which comes, which means it really, essentially your career should be over your, your body's not producing hormones correctly. And that's a very common issue with people that have been in war. People that have been blown up by IED is people that have been hit a lot. Even soccer players a lot of times show a diminished levels of testosterone and growth hormone because of pituitary gland damage. So you wouldn't even allow that. So a female to male would be in a whole nother problem in combat sports because it's not legal for you to take testosterone and compete.
