Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. Whose idea was this for this show? That was my idea. Jesus Christ. Dude, you're an unusual human. It's fun though. And how many of these episodes have you done? We have finished six. And you're going to that, is that the entire season? Yeah, that'll be season one comes out in July. You excited about it? Yeah, I'm, I'm pumped. So 50% of the time you almost died. Yeah. Yeah. I mean that's a gross math around it around. Okay. So there's the water one. Well you almost froze to death. Yup. That definitely. And then the avalanche one will you lasted 30 minutes. What was the other one? Oh Man. Oh Man. Yeah, of worse. Yeah. I mean it was, it was, it was less pleasant. Um, like I was a bull fighter for an episodes out dude and not a bull rider because they're insane. But the bull fighter is the guy that's on the ground.

Speaker 1:          00:57          So when the bull fighter gets thrown, he's the bodyguard for the bull rider. His only job is to take the hit. So the bowl writer doesn't get trampled to death because the moment the bull rider comes off the Bulls back, the bowl is turning around to crush whatever was on its back. And that's where the bullfighter runs into save him. And uh, you know, the, the PBR, the professional bull riders association, um, those guys are the most selfless, courageous guys trying to protect those bullfighters um, bull riders. So I trained for a while and I was, went to the biggest rodeo in the nation and was bull fighter. And um, I mean this isn't one of those shows where people don't get hurt. You're like, you see the inside of my body, you see people get really, really, really jacked up and go to the hospital and like he does he have a punctured lung?

Speaker 1:          01:54          Is that guy going to live? Um, this is that type of show cause there's no other way to do it. The only thing, the only direction we had from discovery was don't fake anything. That's a great direction. That's great direction. I'm glad they came up with that. Now what happened with the bowl? Um, well I, I got owned, which is humiliating because they're not really smart animals. You're fast over there. Jamie's a wizard. Yeah. I like to encourage all little boys and girls that follow me on any social media platform to stay in school, become engineers, architects, accountants are anything that doesn't lead to permanent brain damage or need of an orthopedic surgeon. It's you legs up and a bowl watching you through the air. That was the training week. So this was when you were trying to distract the bowl. What kind of techniques do you use?

Speaker 1:          02:53          Uh, football, running back stuff just juke them one way and the is you actually have to sell that body movement. So like your weight, half your weight has to shift far enough where the bowl is going to really believe that you're going to go to that direction. Um, I wish bowls were so I wish they are dumber than they are because they're not, cause if you fake them once one direction, they won't take it the next time they'll, they'll you try to fake to the right. They'll already start going running to left. So then you fake to the right and you go back to the left and you're like, oh no, I have done an, it's at that moment that Tim realized he had fucked up. Yeah. Then it just gets her own. I got destroyed. And so when you get launched through the air by a bull, it's, it's, it's weird.

Speaker 1:          03:42          Um, because it's, it's weightless, you know, it's just a second and you are completely inverted. No control over where your body is going because you didn't generate that energy. Um, but the other part of you, the other part of your brain is knowing that that bowl is going to try to turn as fast as it can and get you when you land on the ground. Cause that's what it's really good is when you're down. Yeah. So you're trying to keep track of where this bowl is while you're hurling through the air. Like okay, I got to Tuck my chin so I don't break my neck. You know, hopefully I'm not close enough to the fence. The fence doesn't move. The fences metal, the other ground is pretty soft. I'd rather land on the ground and then land on the fence. The fence will mess you up anyways. So that's anyways.

Speaker 1:          04:34          And how'd you get away from the ball? I'm an athlete. I'm not sure if you know that. That's it. That's it. Just athleticism. Yeah. Luck. Little luck. The luck that you didn't get stomped. No. So there was some real bull fighters in the ring with me that I think saved my life every single time because I suck. I at the end of this show, people are going to look at this and be like, one, Tim is an idiot to everybody that does this job. These jobs has the biggest balls and our show. Bad Ass. Hopefully that's what they're going to get. Cause this isn't like a Tim Kenny look cool show. This is, um, that guy's an idiot and everybody else's, it's that fucking picture. Oh my God. Oh my God. Look at that picture. Notice that. That's a different bowl. So you said this more than once. So this, this bolt is, he's got his feet up in the air and his head is inches from you and it's about to collide with you and there's no fucking way you got away in their situation. There's no way that thinks way too close. What is it like to just get a launched 2000 pound fucking meat vehicle?

Speaker 1:          06:02          Okay.
