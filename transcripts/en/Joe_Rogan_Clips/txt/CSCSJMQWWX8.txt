Speaker 1:          00:00          Her low freak bitches. So at any rate, there's a story in there where he talks about, uh, talking to this person who's like, uh, he lived in an all white town except one of the Klansmen that was d hooded talks about, he lived in this all white town and he was raised very racist and that black people were the worst. And there was one black family, like the Johnson's or whatever. And his father told him, all black people are the worst. They're monkeys. They're the worst except the Johnsons. The Johnson's are good, they're good people. And he had this realization is like tickle in his brain of like, wait, my father hates all the black people except the black family that he's met. Like all black people are bad except the one group that he's actually met. And that is like the phenomenon of othering, right?

Speaker 1:          00:46          It's like, oh, black people are bad, Muslims are bad. But actually my friend Tom, the Muslim, he's Nice but Muslims wanna kill me. But the Tom over here, he's a good dude. Anyway, I think other things like the big one of the big problems that we have, well it's also I think what's going on with black lives matter. One of the things that's going on is that they're in the middle of the battle, right? So right in the middle of the battle, every day you wake up prime for battle, getting online, you're active, you're, you're, you're, you're activating your membership, your, you know, organizing, doing whatever. And then this guy comes along and he's doing something totally different. He's out there talking to the clients when you go fuck those people, man. Right? Totally. Yeah. I was for my show that, uh, that I'm doing my comedy central show we're doing, like we just did a cultural appropriation episode and I was, uh, studying.

Speaker 1:          01:37          So I was studying, I was like deep in the cultural appropriation. I was reading so much shit about it. But one of the more interesting things that said about black lives matter, it's kind of connected to this, is that one thing that happens with cultural appropriation and things in general is that people seize on language. We're in like a crazy language war right now, right? Like so many of the phrases that we use, uh, are so charged with secondary and tertiary, meaning that we can't, they didn't even mean anything anymore. Like white privilege is a concept that the moment you bring it up, there's so many levels of eye roll that it's like, I don't even think it's a useful phrase anymore cause it's like the moment you say white privilege than a person, the white person who you're saying it's privileged is going like fuck you.

Speaker 1:          02:16          And the minute someone saying fuck you, you, the conversation has ended it. Yeah. So the thing they said about black lives matter was also a lot of silly people use that expression. No doubt. That's the weird baggage that it has. Like it's the thing that we learned about that I learned about cultural appropriation because for me, I, I roll my eyes so deeply at the concept of cultural appropriation, right? It's like, oh, so I shouldn't eat burritos anymore. Is that what you're also, I always think I'm always really tickled with the idea of like the person saying, oh, you shouldn't wear that tribal gear. And then it's like go to the third world country where the market is and tell the the like impoverished Pa, uh, in merchant like, oh, I'm sorry I can't buy this bit of silk from you because it's racist for me to wear it.

Speaker 1:          02:58          That person. Like please, please buy it and wear it. Like, or you know what I'm saying? Or like the family, it's like, oh, it would be a great honor if you would wear this, sorry, or whatever. Right. So it's a big eye roll. Except then you start to think like upon reading it, it's like, oh, the thing is it's not incidental, it's emotional. It's like deeper than, than just like trying to parse out the logic and go, oh well I found an example where your thing falls apart. It's like it's emotional. There's an emotional reaction. Like when, when somebody, you know, affects, you know, dreads up their hair, even though you can say, but people have been dreading their hair in other cultures for a million years, vikings had dreads and that is true. It doesn't matter because the person that's in front of you, that's a black person that's going, I have pain when I'm, I have this pain that I'm looking at, you know, a person that's affecting my culture without any of the negative parts.

Speaker 1:          03:51          Right? So you can, you can wear the hair and you can have the dreads that, okay. Just because of the word culture. Because if that's the case with someone else, some someone else wearing something that you might find a fit. Like what if you're a person that's extremely, uh, conservative when it comes to dress and you see a woman in a short skirt and you have pain, should that impose upon that woman's ability to wear that skirt? No, definitely. And I'm not making a case that anybody's pain ought to be automatically, uh, adopted as like a behavioral standard. Right? That's not really what I, I learned that from this whole discussion is it's like, it's not really about going. No one is really saying except the most emotionally kind of, uh, in fury. Like the person that doesn't have the language to express what they're really saying.

Speaker 1:          04:37          Almost no one that I read when I was think reading these real like intellectuals and their concepts of cultural appropriation is saying white people should stop doing this stuff altogether. Almost no one, I didn't find one left wing Wolke article that said white people should stop adopting the culture of other, of people of color. Right. Okay. I read a lot of right wing think pieces that were saying this is absurd. Why are you telling us to stop adopting these cultures? Isn't all cultural melting pot and all cultural borrowing. But not once did I read somebody saying white people stop this altogether. Well what did you read? So, so mostly, and I hope I can articulate this well cause I'm, I'm not the best advocate for this position because like I said, it's, it's, it's one that I struggle with that's dubious. It's dubious and difficult.

Speaker 1:          05:24          And there are ridiculous parts of the cultural appropriation argument, but one thing that like it's all connected to historical trauma. It's all deeper. Like basically, let's see if I can articulate this well what this one, um, this one person, and I wish I could find his name actually, but uh, because he deserves it because he's really deep thinker about this stuff was talking about was that, you know, we have racism. Racism is a huge word that that describes everything from a white person like hugging their purse closer to their chest when a black person walks by or even like a weird, like, you know, just the smallest little racial weirdness all the way to lighting across on somebody's, on somebody's lawn to murdering someone. Like that's all encompassed in racism. So they started trying to like parse it out. People are going, when you call someone a racist, right?

Speaker 1:          06:19          They go, I'm not a racist. You're calling me a monster. And then somebody will go, oh no, I meant like a systemically racist. It's like you need more specific examples. So cultural appropriation is one, white privilege is another. There's all these, but still go back to cope. What, what cultural appropriation, like you said that no one was saying don't do it. Right. So what, so what are they doing when they're trying to chop someone's dreads off? Okay. I don't know about this. I mean what, what exactly you mean the San Francisco state example where the girl attacked the guy? I mean that girl was just inarticulately expressing some insanity. I don't, I don't think that's defensible and I, and I think most of the articles and the stuff that I read about that specific instance or just like basically saying that woman's, uh, an uh, a lunatic.

Speaker 1:          07:02          Well, I've heard people though enforce it and I know someone who was mad at their friend is a black girls matter. Her friend who was a white girl who had braids, she had like corn rows and she was mad because she was saying that it's cultural appropriation, cultural appropriation. I said, if you do, you know about Bo Derek, right? Like she was one of the first people to ever have core the Romans, you know, there's corn rows on Roman coins actually, right? I mean, it's crazy thing to call that cultural appropriation, but also saying that a white person shouldn't wear that. That's fucking crazy because what do you, what about a black guy wearing a polo shirt? Well, okay, so, okay. There's a good example, right? Yeah. Is, uh, and again, I'm not like I'm not the greatest advocate for this position. I just read so much that made me empathize with the position.

Speaker 1:          07:45          Not necessarily agree with it, but empathize with where it's coming from. So the Polo for example, when you see you as a white dude or me as a white dude, when I see somebody wearing a polo, it's just a polo. It has no historical antecedent, it has no historical baggage to it and there's no connection to systemic racism or, or Elvis Presley stealing the cream of the intellectual musical crop and then never giving back to that community or Iggy Azalea coming in, adopting a black accent and then just like taking all the money and running, you know, it has no connection to deeper root systems like these trees have the communicate with each other, like tastes bitter. Right? So all it is is a polo. It's just a guy wearing a polo. It's, and that's why the counterargument doesn't make sense because it's like nobody's upset when they see a black dude and a polo shirt.

Speaker 1:          08:30          Uh, I mean maybe some weird racist guy is, is, but mostly not. On the other hand, when a person sees a white person affecting a deep part of black culture without any of the baggage that is associated with it, like for example, dreads, right? One of the arguments I read a lot is that like white people wearing braids and dreads, you know, you get rewarded for it. You look cool, you look and meanwhile black women are having a difficult time getting a job because they have black hair or black people getting fired from jobs because they have dreads. Right? So there's these consequences that black people experience because of black shit that white people that are adopting it don't necessarily experience.

Speaker 2:          09:11          That's true at all. I think if you were working in an office and some white dude at dreads, he'd be highly suspicious of his behavior. Well, for example, this guy has kind of like get dork. I hear what you're saying. I'm going to hire him. There's a guy that had hair like you and right next to him, some stinky white dude with them. Stinky dreads. Has dreads. Stink. Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:28          Dreads out. Let's say. Well, that's a good example. Okay. There in the u s military, there was just a, a new, um, a new set of acceptable hairstyles and Mo, almost every one of the unacceptable hairstyles that they, that they, that they put into place. It was basically black hair. Like what braids? Wearing your hair natural? Um, I don't know the intro. What do you mean? I mean, I would have to, we'd have to be like an Afro. Yeah, a short, short afro. Yeah. I mean, you're not allowed to do that. You'd have to pull up the article to give the specific examples, but basically there are a million different examples like that. And like I said, I'm not, I'm not necessarily an advocate for hed and, and honor the call of the appropriation accuser. I'm more like now realizing that, uh, I'm more now realizing that there's like just a lot of deep emotional, weird trauma underneath every, every accusation of appropriation. It's not that I think therefore white girls shouldn't wear braids. It's that I think I understand more where the person that is upset is coming from it. Just from a compassionate perspective. You didn't know. I get that. I get that. It just logically it doesn't, it's not about logic.

Speaker 2:          10:45          Yeah. But it should be all human interaction should have some base in logic if you're going to communicate with things. I don't agree because emotions aren't about logic, right? But should anybody be subject to your own emotions? Like Shit. Like you change your behavior, your dress. If you're a person who's completely not racist, but you enjoy the way your hair looks, if it's in braids, should you take into consideration all the people that you're gonna run into and they're going to be upset at you over braids, even though they're ignorant about the history of braids and cornrows, should you alter or change your behavior? Should you accept the fact that you're just going to have a certain amount of cultural appropriation?

Speaker 1:          11:18          Well, let me ask you this, like if you, I don't have an answer to that question. I don't,

Speaker 2:          11:23          that is an important part of this. I mean, if you're going to accept the fact that there's some sort of an emotional attachment to these things, and that's where the argument comes from, shouldn't you decide or at least contemplate whether or not that emotion is valid? It doesn't seem to be, seems to be this real examples of racism and horrible things. Like if you want to, you know, make your eyes squinty and look like a Japanese character from a bugs bunny cartoon in, you know, 1940 and then you want to go to a party and people think you're a racist, you should, you should be

Speaker 1:          11:54          aware that you're presenting an image that is inherently racist. Like that's, that's something that's kind of fucked up. And you should be considerate about the way people's emotions are going to fire up looking at your image. That's what I'm saying. Yeah, but that's a different thing than braids. Oh, but oh, but that's what I'm, I, I'm not advocating, first of all, I'm not advocating anything. I'm just saying I've, I've delved into this topic enough that I've started to understand where people are coming from when they, when they get activated by send too. But I think a big part of it is reinforcement in the community that that's acceptable to be upset at people for corn rows or braids. And I don't, I actually don't disagree with you. I think you're right about that. And yet I think it also is connected to like a legitimate emotional reality that's happening.

Speaker 1:          12:39          Like for example, by the way, logic is, is very important. And I would say logic is more important than emotion when it comes to communication. But it doesn't because something is more important, doesn't negate the, the importance of the other thing. Well, it certainly doesn't solve the situation just by clearly using the logic. You might get a certain percentage of the people that agree with you because of logic, but that's more rare than it is common, right? It's like, would you, would you feel comfortable going to a native American powwow? You know, with a headdress on, not even a pilot, there's a powwow next door, you can see it and you're at a music festival. Would you wear an Indian head? I wouldn't, but the reason why you can't and the reason why you shouldn't, or the reason why it's an issue is because the people are marginalized.

Speaker 1:          13:19          Let me take my own people. I'm Italian and my people, for the longest time there was a lot of anti Italian races and my grandfather, he's talked to me about it, what it was like coming off the boat, but then somewhere along the line it became acceptable for Italians in, in, in American culture where it's not, there's no real racism. It doesn't stick. Like you call it Italian Guinea, Guinea to our face and we will laugh. No one cares. You can make meatballs and Spaghetti all day long. Nobody gives a shit. Nobody accuses you of, uh, you know, you have a pizza party. Nobody thinks it's cultural appropriation, but try having a TACO party try haven't Taco Tuesdays people get pissed you. Why? Because Mexicans still experience real racism in this country. Whereas Italians largely just don't. Right. And like Taco Tuesdays and example of something that's like, who fucking cares?

Speaker 1:          14:05          That's not important. And so if I'm wearing a Sombrero, exactly offensive to people, if that's as, that's as deep as most people go. Right. That's dumb. What are you talking about at Kennedy to Taco? I mean that's done and it is dumb, but if you kind of like get under the Dme, which is the name of my, my third out, my third special. So it's not yet live in Oakland now. Fucking Hitler and then get under the dumb. But if you get under the first like the most, the epidermal layer of like flashy and sanity and go like, what's really happening here is like, oh, it's just what you're saying actually you're more woke than you, than you let on June interest. It's like, it's really about like power dynamics. It's not really about the appropriation incident, although on some level maybe it is. It's really about the power dynamic underneath it. Well, I think one of the things that we're seeing in universities in particular is people

Speaker 2:          14:52          that are exercising the ability to affect change even if it doesn't make sense because they have the ability to uh, point out something that they think is incorrect or is unjust and then they attack it and go after it and then they see results. And by seeing those results, it's almost in a lot of ways kind of attached to the same idea. Like if you're worth x amount of dollars, why do you still chase money? Because you're trying to get the thrill of the accomplishment. There's the game that's going on and there's a certain amount of game going on trying to get that white kid that you don't even know to cut off his dreads. Whether or not you know that the Romans wore dreads, whether or not you know that the Greeks wore dreads, the vikings and all these different people had them. It doesn't matter. It's like there's a little tiny white guy and that girl could yell at that white guy then chase him with a pair of scissors.

Speaker 1:          15:39          Yeah, exactly. It's, it's the incidents are the absurdity, but the, but the current, the conceptual current is somewhat valid. I mean, the knee over, you know, I'm sorry, but to some degree, like even you, and I think that you're naturally skeptical towards concepts like cultural appropriation because, and I am too, because as a, especially as Comedians, it's very easy to see the absurdity. It's so stupid and it's so, it's a pointless, like, well, we can't not adopt each other's cultures. That won't ever happen. So, but even we'd go, okay, but I wouldn't wear a Sombrero to a Mexican club. I wouldn't walk into a club like, oh, hey, what's up? Right. So eat. So if you say, okay, it's almost pornography, right. I know it when I see it. I know when I know it's offensive when I feel it. Right. You know, so if you kind of expand further and go, okay, even the absurd examples, I kind of understood.

Speaker 1:          16:29          I'm going to try to understand from me. I'm going to try to understand where people are coming from with that. Then I can kind of contextualize it. No, I don't have to agree with it, but I can at least say, oh, I get where this is coming from. It's coming from historical antecedents of racism and oppression that are connected to hairstyle and, and the, and, and uh, all of these musicians that have taken black culture and made money off of it. There's all this like deeper sedimentary layers of emotionality. I don't have to heat it and change accordingly, but I do, I would be foolish to ignore it. Right.

Speaker 2:          17:01          Yeah, that completely makes sense. And also I get it from a point of view of a person comes from culture that used to be maligned and he isn't anymore.

Speaker 1:          17:09          I wanted to make one final point about that cause I, I think I figured out how to make my cultural appropriation point. Uh, I don't want to take us back too far, but I think what we're, what we're doing is like, and we came to a good place with a dislike. What we're talking about, it's all about language, right? So cultural appropriation, your immediate reaction is, that's absurd. And some of the examples people use is absurd. But the, the underneath the racism is just, we're talking about racial insensitivity, we're talking about being insensitive. And if you try to just focus on that, then you can get to like the reality of what's happening. And the original point I wanted to make was in this article I read about it, it said that we often get locked on linguistic the, the, the boat that the concept floats in on the absurd boat.

Speaker 1:          17:54          So like black lives matter is the ultimate example you gave. I just thought this was such a fascinating point is like black lives matter, it's the name of the organization that is there to fight against police brutality and killing of black kids. Right? And people react to the words, right? So people go, what are you talking about? Black lives matter. All lives matter. Blue lives matter. And basically if you, you don't acknowledge that it's black lives matter to that, which is really obvious, right? You're fighting about the words black lives matter where we haven't been talking. You've left the, the foundation principle behind like a long time ago, which is police brutality. No one's even talking about police brutality anymore. Now they're just talking about the language that you chose to call your group. So at any rate, I think that was the thing I was trying to say.

Speaker 2:          18:39          No, that makes sense. Look, all of it makes sense. If what is going on is people are being racist, right? If someone is doing something for racial inappropriate or, um, cultural appropriation at the heart of it involves racial insensitivity or racist in sensitivity,

Speaker 1:          18:57          but there's, there's difference, right? Racist, theoretically, racist is an, again, racism is a word that doesn't have a lot of use anymore either. Because you described the same phenomenon of you saying to like your black friend. Like, wow, I didn't expect it to be so articulate. You mean well, right. You mean you were trying to be polite, right. Or I don't like black people there. They're bad. These are the same. It's the same word to describe both of those things. Right, right. So in sensitivity is, is not overt and aggressive racism. Yeah. I think,

Speaker 2:          19:31          yeah, yeah, yeah. It's insensitive. It's insensitive racism. Like you're not being sensitive to the possibility that you're saying something offensive

Speaker 1:          19:39          or just doing something boarish Lee dump. Now I agree with you. The logic is more important than that than that. But I think, you know, the more aware we can all be about how to not be a dick. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          19:50          It's like people want to say, um, you know, you could never have all in the family on TV today. Could you imagine people would go crazy? Well then that's cause we moved past that. I mean that's what's going on. What's going on is there's a process and one of the things is disturbing to people about Trump and what's disturbing to people about this new, um, freedom to mock Jews or to pointed them as the root of all evil and that it's much more open than it's been before, is it? We thought we got through that and then slowly but surely the demonization of individual groups and in terms of, you know, like who, who are the bad guys and who are the good guys? And instead having it been boiled down to activities and behaviors and individual human beings that are the problem, not giant groups of people that believe in one God versus another God, which is what it's been historically. The idea is that as time goes on and as people like my people, the Italians become so integrated

Speaker 1:          20:48          that you can't be racist about us anymore. Right. It doesn't work. Right. Totally. I mean it really doesn't work. Yeah. It's one of the best examples of it. And totally, it's, it's fascinating because there's so many things that are there still and you're like, they don't have any charge or power any longer. Not only that, there's so much gross behavior by Italian, it just goes unchecked, you know? And I think the soprano's is probably responsible for a lot of that. I was in Italy, uh, last year and I was walking home real late at night and I saw this guy, he's got his girlfriend up against the car and he's fucking like going off on her and I'm like this little like liberal American boy, like, is somebody going to call the police? And then I kind of stood there for a while longer and he's screaming in her face, and then I just like look for about like two or three minutes ago. Oh, this is just some Italian shit. I just walked home.

Speaker 3:          21:44          Okay.
