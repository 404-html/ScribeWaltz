Speaker 1:          00:00          Beat up, this is gotta be taking up a tremendous amount of your time. Like what if, are you doing anything else in addition to doing this? Are you setting aside everything else in your life other than your family obligations? I have two jobs, man. One, uh, help accelerate society to try and deal with this historic transition, Maryanne, and to stay married. Those only things I'm about. Wow, that's a, that's a powerful path. Um, now when, when you're looking at the opposition and you look in all the other people that are running for president and wonder whether or not they're going to be there by the time the elections roll around, would it, what are you saying that's, it's really interesting, Joe. Holy Cow. That one of the funnest things about running for president is you run into all the other candidates on the trail in Iowa, in New Hampshire.

Speaker 1:          00:46          So I'm like just hanging out backstage with like the gang. It's so interesting and fun. It is weird sometimes, but I really liked most of them. And so sometimes people ask me like, Hey, who do you want your running mate to be? And I'm just like, it really depends upon who I just click with best because we're just going to be on the trail all the time together. So having met a bunch of them, I got to say most of the candidates are really genuine patriots who just want to try and do something positively. See the country's heading in the wrong direction. I could work with most all of them, uh, in terms of who I think is going to be there in the end. Man, it's really interesting. Uh, I mean, one reason I like, I will say that apparently the mainstream press had it out for Bernie last time where they were just going to, like, I have a friend who worked in the media and they were like, just like, you know, kneecap Bernie.

Speaker 1:          01:32          Why was he going the kneecap brain? Um, well it's like there's definitely something going on where like certain corporate media companies have certain candidates, they kind of want to tip the scales for a little brown and people that they want to like tip it against. Well, they thought that Bernie was going to get in the way of Hillary winning. Is that the idea? Yeah. Yeah. I mean they, they, they were in the Hillary camp for sure. Yeah. And so that wasn't just the media, that was also the DNC, which is now on the record. So now happily, certainly the DNC has turned a totally different leaf where the DNC is like, we're not going to do anything that like, and your peers with Eddie Woods prospects. Well, what they did was a disaster. A disaster in terms of public image too. Yeah. Yeah. It was both substantively and like perception wise, the disaster for them.

Speaker 1:          02:17          So this time I got to say, and that the team is turned over almost entirely, like it's almost totally different people. And then the media, I, we have the sense that, you know, they're, they're still feeling out who they're going to try and put the thumb on the scale for. Uh, so Ernie, Bernie is still running though, right? It looks like he's running it. You want to know something that's really stupid, but it changed my opinion of him. He was being grilled by some of them at the airport with a camera and he was pretending to talk on the phone, but you could tell he wasn't really on the phone white and I saw that and I was like, oh, you can't do that. You can't do that. You could say, I'm not giving impromptu interviews. Thank you very much. And keep walking. Like if you want to interview me, do it through the correct channels.

Speaker 1:          03:01          But he didn't do that. He pretended to be on the phone. It's a weird thing because if you're willing to do that, like that's just, this is deceptive. Especially if you can actually see the deception, which clearly you can see the video of the fucking phone is not on. It's like he's, it's like you could see his text messages and he's like, and the guy saying to him, you're not on the phone. I can tell you're not on the phone. And he keeps walking. It's like, I know that's a stupid thing, but it's like, Huh. We all, we all saw out details about different people in different areas, you know, and like, you know, it's like, I think, uh, one reason I'm so grateful for this opportunity as I was like, you know, like you actually can get a sense of different people in different environments and it does end up impacting your, your perception.

Speaker 1:          03:48          So I mean, people made decisions on much lesser data points in that, that way. I'll remember what the fuck's his name from Vermont who uh, Howard Dean. The Dean scream man, the freaking [inaudible] he's from where he was from. Vermont. Vermont. Yeah. That scream killed him. Sank him. Do you remember the Chappelle show parody? The Chappelle show party of that was hysterical. It's funny, but the fact that that it was just because it was a loud, like, as a person who works in front of audiences a lot, when you're yelling into a microphone, like the, the, you hear like, especially if you don't have monitors in front of you, what you hear is like everything. You hear the crowd screaming, you hear everything. And if you're yelling into that microphone, you're not realizing what it sounds like as a recording with him is like, yeah. And that was it.

Speaker 1:          04:37          One scream, I imagine, imagine that one scream literally changed the course of that man's life. One and most of that might've changed the course of the nation's history. Might've crazy. I don't know if that would happen today. I think especially post Trump, one thing that has happened is we're willing to forgive so much more, you know, in some ways. Yeah. In some ways. No, man. I mean, I feel like, you know, like some, some people, uh, uh, more forgiving than others for different things and for sure there's certainly, yeah, it varies. But it would be interesting to imagine what a, what the dean scream would result in today. Hopefully I'm not the person that tests it out. Scream, please don't scream.
