Speaker 1:          00:00          Breaking it down. Uh, you know, smoke up. We help through. It doesn't, I ain't gonna lie to you. They do. Oh thank God it's legal now. I didn't start until the after my last, uh, to Leonardo. Really? Yeah. First Time that I did, but honestly it was probably like the best thing they get it because I was angry at the fight. I was angry at everything, you know, I was like fuck, how can I, you know this guy, I was like a 10 to one favorite going into that fight. That was the one fight with that never saw much. I was like, don't you smoke them? Uh, so I just had this anger and the only way I saw my dad can I deal with it was it was alcohol. So I kinda turned to that and you know that it's no good. It's really, it's the worst way to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:43          Worst way to do it. It just makes the delusions bigger. You know what I'm saying? It just makes you angry or in and it just, it just kind of compounded everything. But honestly like what have smoked weed, it was like, cause at that point like you know what, I had tuned it out for so long because that's what folks did that I kind of associated with being lazy and the hospice as well. And you know, these fucking me to know, you know, I don't want to be using that because on a corner. Right, right. Like uh, but when I did it, it kind of opened up the anger towards myself. You know what I mean? It kind of opened up my mind for the first time and, and, and I think that actually did help a lot of help with any, you know, I don't, I don't like chronic or nothing, but you know, I know what you're saying. Yeah. I think that's what people were afraid

Speaker 2:          01:27          of with it too, is that paranoia. I would say paranoia is just you looking at things realistically and even the possibilities of things happening realistically. I mean some people for sure if they have tendencies to be schizophrenia in particular and then they smoke a lot of weed, it could spiral them.

Speaker 1:          01:43          Cool. Yeah. Like anything else. I spoke to my, it's not a good idea. And you know, do doing too much of any one thing. It's not a good idea. I mean, he's the same way. You have to, you have to be able to balance, you know what I mean? You can't just fucking sit on the couch all day, but I'm glad

Speaker 2:          01:59          you're saying that there's a real benefit to it too. There's some, there's a benefit to it mentally and exposing that vulnerability and just making you aware of who you really are. Like maybe to other people. We all, especially men, I think we puff our chests up and we like to look at ourselves as a baby better than we really are because it's, it's, it's like a shield, like a false confidence shield that you put up to protect yourself from your vulnerability. But marijuana says, no, no, no, fuck that. Why don't you just look at whatever the fuck your vulnerability and stop doing that stupid like this is, this is your problem. This is what you're scared of. You're like, shit, the weeds, right? Yeah. It can help you.

Speaker 1:          02:37          Yeah. And it, and it Kinda a Alexa App, especially after a fight. I remember it. That really made me, that really helped me to get over and not just get over it, but to understand it and understand what I was doing. Uh, because again, you just don't, you know, you get that the informal is maybe it's testosterone. You get that fucking puppy, just all, you know, you don't give a fuck. That's the part of it for sure. You know, it's just, it's also

Speaker 2:          03:00          think about what you're doing for live in, man. I'm, it's the most, one of the most risky propositions you could do as a human being

Speaker 1:          03:06          outside of war. That, that too. That too. And I, and I took that and to, you know, you, you obviously you take that into consideration when you, when you start doing something like this, uh, I'd taken into consideration every fight. Um, you know, once slight one slip up, you can be, you know, bad news. Sure. Injury can take you out forever. You know, especially when the EU was, and when I was in my situation and even when I was signed with the UFC, it was like, okay, do I go and try and be a doctor and you know, or, you know, I was, I was going into bio mat, so I was like, I was really, that seemed more secure. You know what I mean? That seems more like attainable easier, or do I like throw caution to the wind? And you know, at the time when I was 18 or 19, uh, no, I guess I'm, yeah, 19. Uh, you know what, that was like a hard, you know what I'm saying? I'm one of those ones that was hard for me to make, but it turned out well, I guess,

Speaker 2:          04:05          you know, you're going to have more than one interest too. That's also part of the problem. There's probably, there's a lot of people out there that like doing different things and you know, you might be leaning more towards one than the other and you just gotta kind of soul search.
