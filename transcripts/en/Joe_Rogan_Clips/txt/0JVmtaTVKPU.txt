Speaker 1:          00:00          Dude. I think when people are immune to have dicks in the future, it just seems like everything's going away so fast, man. They're trying to do that with this new, a Gillette commercial. I've seen that Gillette commercial [inaudible] I heard about it that you can shave your buddy or something. That's really mad because it's like an anti masculine Gillette commercial and makes like every man look like a massage and his piece of shit. It's such a disturbing commercial. It's like over and over again. Men doing douchey shit like, hey bro, aren't you selling razors? Do and you changing the world with your shitty fucking advertiser based philosophy. What are you doing? Like what are you doing? Who fucking green lit this? How's Atlanta? But like, Yo Yo yo guys, people get hair. They want to fucking shave it. You're not getting it fixed. Imagine if you are of sexist rapist piece of shit and you see that Gillette commercial like, damn, I got to switch my game.

Speaker 1:          00:53          I've been too much of a dick. Like, does anybody think that Gillette commercials or somehow or another in any way, shape or form going to affect culture is bad. You're selling. Razors is bad. It's just a razor. I'd rather break my fucking face here than by Gillette. Again, he wants to be lectured to wear a tie or heard of that. So sick of that. You don't have your shit together. Nobody has their shit together. And you telling people how to get their shit together in a fucking razor blade at yeah. Yeah. Don't be racist. We know. Yeah. Don't be a sexist. Yeah, we know. We know. Most people aren't. Yeah. This is like, you got it. Like most people are the videos, like most people. All right. It's not, most people are crazy. That's a disproportionate amount of people that are, that's what I hate about it.

Speaker 1:          01:36          A lot of the, this, a lot of these ideas, the ideology today, it's like, like they say, everybody where I'm from is racist or everybody's like, uh, you know, um, some Christian Bible thumping. And that's true. So many of the people I know are not that at all that it's unbelievable. But so many of the people in some and these other places, they don't even know anybody from there. So it's like they have no idea, but they immediately stereotyped because of your accent too. You have a southern accent. People assume you're not bright. Yeah, it's so stupid. But it's also, it's indicative of what the place used to be like. Like what the world used to be like was like a lot of the rural edge areas were less educated. Now that there's the internet, the world is a different place, man. You can meet cool people in Wichita, Kansas. You meet cool people everywhere. Everywhere you go, you're going to run into pockets of cool people. Cool. People are everywhere, man. So good people. Good people are everywhere and they're, they have different values and a lot of them are more community oriented, more friendly.
