Speaker 1:          00:01          Conversion therapies, the weirdest shit of all time. There was a, an article that I've read, uh, about, uh, they were, they were manipulating pleasure. It turned out it's, I started, I started reading it from a, a study on rats and they did this thing with rats where they, um, provided they've, they figured out a way to give rats orgasms. They figured out a way to jazz up the pleasure center of the brain and they would do anything to do it. They would, they would shock, they would run up, pass an area that shocked them. Like they, they, they did do it, do anything to get to this area where they can have these orgasms and they wouldn't have him up to 2000 times a day. They would just not just all day long. And in reading male and female rats. Yeah, just rats just right there. Just, just rats trying to come. And so when I was that we're in hour three.

Speaker 1:          00:57          Oh, it's amazing. She studies amazing. Well this is what's amazing about it. Sorry folks. Mr Mrs [inaudible] time to turn away. They did it with a, a gay man. While they were doing this, this is in the 1970s. There's a couple different studies that they did, but one of them they did with this gay guy where they tried to stimulate certain parts of his brain while they were showing him heterosexual porn and they were trying to convert him into being heterosexual. And apparently they had some meager amount of success with this where he engaged in sexual relationships with women and uh, and apparently even enjoyed it. And they did something to the, literally stimulate a part of his brain that would excite arousal and tried to connect that with, um, with heterosexual porn and, and made him orgasm, uh, made him masturbate to orgasm while they were doing this and showing him straight porn.

Speaker 1:          01:56          And the idea was that they were going to reprogram his mind. How'd that work out? It didn't, but it did. It did in terms of short term. But it didn't mean it must have been just massively confused, easily sexuality. It's not just about what makes you have an orgasm. No, it's not. It's also incredibly, it's incredibly complex. And one of the things that happens is, uh, you, you get, you can have gay experiences when you're young, if someone does something to you in imprints upon you arousal at a young age with, with gay experiences, sometimes even heterosexual men will get aroused by certain gay images and gay things because of their past. Because of that. Like Chris is talking about that we're all on a spectrum and speculative. Yes, I think so for sure. We all certainly are. But it's also speculative. How much of that spectrum is influenced by your environment versus your jeans and you know, and this is very taboo for some people discuss, even though it's really the human sexuality is incredibly fascinating and there's, there's some major taboo areas of exploration and when you start looking at like what makes a person gay or straight, whether it's nature or nurture, whether it's a combination of those things where it's someone's just radically gay from the room or whether someone's radically straight from the womb.

Speaker 1:          03:21          These, these studies where they were trying to, they were trying to turn someone with science and they were trying to turn someone straight. It's cray. It's, uh, it's very, you couldn't do it today. You'd never be able to do it today in America. Yeah. I believe it was [inaudible] 71 they did it. Yeah. I'll send it to you. It's crazy. It's crazy. Um, widely criticized, but heavily studied. You know, the woman, they did it to a woman to, uh, they, they stuck these, this woman had a problem with pain killers and so, um, they figured out a way to wire her brain. Is this like electric shock therapy? These fucking dental drills, they put holes in their brain. They fucking can do whatever they wanted. Do this. Now's the time we break out the Ilan Musk weed.
