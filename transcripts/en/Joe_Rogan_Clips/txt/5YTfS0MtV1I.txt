Speaker 1:          00:00          I take it. You like those kinds of pants? Yeah, I love that. It's not his pants. This boot cuts or give me some predictions. I'm a Ryan Bader Tko second round grandpa first round. And Jesus said he can show respect bro. Knock him out in the first room crying babies. Oh really? Wow. And he's been on one tonight though. Yeah, that'd be right. I hate to ruin it for you. So calm. I think if Ryan doesn't respect for it fade or he can get cracked. Well here's the thing about bait or too, as much as he loved [inaudible] I'm high, I'm so hot. Remember when he and his big fights like you lost the rumble Johnson, John Jones, like a lot of the big moments, he is caught up sometimes Johnson shot a bad shot and fucking he balanced his head to the moon. So this is the finals of their heavyweight tournament tournament.

Speaker 1:          00:50          That would make Brian Bader be the heavyweight champ champ champ champ champ champ. He owns the light heavyweight one right now. Yeah. What's up John Jones trying and run it back, Bro, those years ago. Are you bringing up old shit? Is that he says, well, you bring up old shit. It's run it back. Is that what he said? Nope. That's what I'm saying. Terrible site visitors like that to lift champ shit, right? Yeah. More. Hey Bro, that song or started it now. Fucking everyone wants to do it. Well, there's a few guys, it gets a little dark. I like that. I love it. Yeah, it, it ties up the division so it gets a little messy, but I'd love to see, could be, but 70 and Woodley's go 85 is the belt and 45 are 35 pound belt and I was going to go out there. Here's the thing, I really believe this. I think if some, this is an egregious error and there's a fight that stopped prematurely. I think you should almost put it up to the vote of the Internet. I really do take you at your goddamn mind.

Speaker 1:          01:47          Bueller vote. Yes. Popular vote. Didn't you say most people like 70% of the pump duration of dummies? No, 68 it's about why the fuck would we ever want to popular vote Amy. Okay, but let's, how about we have and say, how about we have an organization of esteemed ladies and gentlemen, an organization of maybe 200 accepted martial artists, worldclass martial artists, people that, a committee of a hundred people, young guys, what the fuck they're doing? You're going to get the decision, right? That's a great idea. If you have it so much better than the Internet. Trolls, voting, John Hackleman fins and John, Donna, hers and for Rasa hobbies and Duke Roof Rack Jackson, Mike Winkeljohn or whichever Whitman's and you've got a committee of the whole eastern friends, friends, Brian Killen and leave. You do have something like that, Dwayne lushy fair. If you have those, Tom Scurrah, Burt, if you had all those people in like a database and they all put in their opinion, you would be 100% probably in agreement, especially if the experts, yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:57          All right, here we go. Fade or looking, stoic. Nervous. I'm kind of nervous. Or Ryan. Well, it's scary, man. He's fighting to fade or bro and he comes out. They get, you know, as he's older, he definitely doesn't give a fuck anymore. He just wants to take your head off. He's the second round hammer. My watch bro. He's looking for that hammer. Could that right hand feed or it's just get that left hand loose and that right hand balled the few fucking laughing pico is ever going to lose again. So I've, I don't know what's going to happen. Hey man, anything could happen. It's still one of the greatest heavyweights of all time. And Ryan Bader is a better fighter than he's ever been and and really slick man. He's smart. He's smart and his approach. Oh. Oh, what's up bro? Beautiful Shot. I told you to holy shit is left Eddie, but call it dude.

Speaker 1:          03:50          He's got a sneaky left. Took a turn. Done this, this fucking tournament. Oh, Chemo beat mitre. Own Fuck. Did I just starch fucking fade or two? No one starts his fate or luck and it was a weird left. Took like, it was almost like a, like it started out as a jab and then I'll turn it over at the, at Arizona state left hook, like how rose knocked out. You are a racks. So yes, I want to see that. Holy Shit. Call it the top shelf gods were grabbing. Keeps the cookies. Trying to tell you guys, you guys list top shelf a damn. Look at this. Watch this. Watch this left hand. It's almost like a jab he draws, which she was going to it almost like fake the single. Oh Yeah, look at that again. Being so crazy good for him.

Speaker 1:          04:44          That's a good stop. Stop. There's two shots. Gosh, that was almost like that Dan Henderson Bisbing shot that extra shot. Do you think that's add? That's evident. Watch this again. Is that evidence of fader just can't take a shot or is it a perfect punch or is it both? Hey, there has heavy fuck. I think it's both. I think it's, he's also forward a little bit of that. It's a little bit of both, but damn, it's a perfect punch. He, he dropped his shoulder down like you almost like he's going to jab to the body, right? Yeah. Yeah. It looked like almost a shot. Jeff Damn Dude five. I was about to get paid. So what happens now? He's a free agent. They've got to pay the cow. Look at the heavyweight Kaos light heavyweight champ. Hail. Shout out to be a left, right? Shout out to Ryan Bader, man.

Speaker 1:          05:31          It's party. You sad to watch fate or get cracked like that. Oh, interesting. Well just cause I'm up to date as my buddy. Listen, you did call it dude, and he's texting everybody. Twins. He's texting. Everybody told you pitch told you motherfuckers nice. At a certain point you just can't take shots. You get hit. That wasn't a, that was a nice shop, but it didn't appear to me. You know that it was the heaviest shot ever. I hate to say I told you so to anybody, but to young fighters, this kind of shit is what I'm always trying to point out. Don't get caught up in the moment. Don't get caught up in wars because every one of those will, eventually, there's gonna come a time when that credit card bills going to come and you've got all these charges and it just, you don't have the money. You can have to pay it.
