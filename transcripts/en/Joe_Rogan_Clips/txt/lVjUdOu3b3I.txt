Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. You know when I think it's one of the things that I've been guilty of and I know a lot of other people have been guilty of it too just to totally come clean. I defend pot so much that I never look at the potential negative consequences of people doing pot if they're too young because I didn't do it when I was down. Army did a few times, maybe like a handful of times before I was 30 and then when I was 30 I met Eddie Bravo. We started getting blazed all the time and it changed the entire world. Pot I smoked pot was 14 I'd, well I definitely smoked it younger than that. I smoked when I was eight my Stepdad gave me someone. I was eight just to a puff cause I was curious. I was like, what? What? What happens when you do it?

Speaker 1:          00:43          He goes, do you want to try it? I said, how much should I breathe? And he goes, don't breeding in it a lot. Just breathing a little bit. This is obviously like sketchy memory. I did it once when I was eight and then the next time I did I was probably like 14 and then I did it probably maybe again when I was 14 when we cut school and some of the kids, a couple of kids that were the cool guys that I kind of took a liking to me and I was like, cool, the cool kids like me, I'm going to go hang out with these dudes. They smoked weed and I remember I hit it and very, and they were telling me like, have you ever smoked weed or no, I never spoke with her. I'm, nothing might happen to you the first time.

Speaker 1:          01:15          But I remember vividly hitting this joint with these dudes and literally spending probably an hour and 30 minutes laughing my balls off that. Nothing. And I thought it was the greatest thing ever and from then on I was like, I quit baseball. No it pop Warner became an artist. I started drawing and painting on walls. I was like, I was a different person. That changed my life. We eat is another thing that's probably semi responsible for my path. I had a very important moment when I was 16 I got only smoked weed a handful of times before I was 30 years old, like less than 12 like legitimately and a one time when I was 16 it was me and my girlfriend and my best friend who went over her house and uh, I had stole some weed for my Stepdad and we had rolled up a joint and we got so high we were teleporting.

Speaker 1:          02:10          We would like find ourselves in the kitchen, astral cleaning type shall be staring at each other on the couch and then all of a sudden we'd be in the backyard. We were barbecued. We were were fucking 16 I think my girlfriend at the time was 15 had Josh was my age, he was, he was 16 and we were just time traveling all over the fucking building. It was, we were way too high. That's how I described the, for the, the first and only time I ever smoked dust. Oh Jesus. He did that. Well, I hung out with like when I was one of the neighbors as I moved into this. Is there a fucky gateway drug to dust as it's called Solos, like Lowe's? Did they go right from Diet Pepsi to dust? I don't know. Here's my story is I moved onto this street called Independence Avenue in, in the valley.

Speaker 1:          02:59          It's like West valley kind of Desoto Sherman Way Ish. And it was heavily Latino neighborhood and like we moved in and it was cool. I mean like I lived here, I came friends with a lot of people, but like, um, I went from like the end of elementary school into junior high right in that era. So like once we hit the junior high, it's like a lot of the domestic in kids I was hanging around with, started hanging out with you a little bit older Mexican kids and a lot of them were dealing in like kind of gang life over there. Um, uh, it's just part of the way they get down. And then so, and a lot of them like to fucking do dips, which is like a fucking sherm cigarette dipped into my fucking angel dust angel dust. Sounds like healthy choice dude's out. It's how I wound up with this, this little tattoo right here.

Speaker 1:          03:42          First Tattoo I ever had in my life. This little three dots. Normally it's supposed to be up here, but I wasn't in a gang. Oh. And so it's like for some reason they, I was so fucked up. This is what wound up, I mean this, this represents what they call them a Mi Vida loca. It's like little three dots here, but it's like that happened because I smoke dust because these dudes pass me the sherm. I didn't really know what I was looking. I was like this bang and the literally the way you just described that time travel and it was like, I felt like if I thought of something to do, by the time I was finished with the thought of thinking to do it, I had already done it.

Speaker 1:          04:15          I'm going to call my mom goodbye mom. That kind of thing. It was like fucking nuts. I fucking never experienced anything like that. I was terrified. I was terrified, terrified. I didn't know what the fuck is going on. It was almost like, you know, it gave me a lot of feelings is if you remember the first Friday movie when Chris Tucker reflects on like somebody snuck in a little piece of dust, any fucking la. It's, I didn't lose my mind naked, all that shit. But I feel like I was the butt of a joke that night. Like, like somebody gave me some dust. It was like, let's watch fucking the white boy fucking trip on dust on it. But it made for a good story on Joe Rogan. So, no, I'm, you know, we're either,

Speaker 2:          05:05          okay.
