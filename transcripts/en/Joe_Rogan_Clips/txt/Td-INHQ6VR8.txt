Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello

Speaker 2:          00:01          Freak bitches. I can, my mom was cleaning houses. It would make it $6 an hour. My Dad, teamster warehouse foreman and uh, they, we get a watch poor growing up, lower middle class and then went to the school. You sent me to school in San Francisco with all these rich kids. So I was doing all these rich houses and houses in, uh, if people don't know, San Francisco at Pacific Heights is really nice and it's old now. It's like fucking $12 million houses and that's where we were hanging out. Parents would have abandoned them on the weekends and we'd have run of these fucking houses. Just crazy. Like my buddy broke a $25,000 vase and then we're like, let's get the fuck out of here. We'll pay for it. And we were in all these, I was like smoking some guys Cubans on sitting in his chair. I'm a kid from the inner sunset district who shouldn't be all of these places, but I think that's what lit a fire under my ass because I'm working for the, my mom eventually has just great rags to riches story where she was working at this company and then she became an account rep and then she became the head account Rep.

Speaker 2:          01:11          Then she began to vice president. Then she bought the company and quadrupled the company in size. Wow. And that's where I went to work for her. Even though I wanted to be a standup comic, I go to work for her. I am firing people for living, which is a whole nother fucking thing. And just say I really was forced into this. Very tough. My Dad and my mom were very fucking brutal. Half Mexican, half Sicilian. I could have, again, I could have been up there and miserable fucking with, you know, firing people nonstop. And it's like taking on other people's problems because that's what I did is like if you have a business or you work somewhere, we'd employ everybody working there. So you didn't have to deal with any of the headaches. But then I got all the headaches, so I've been chased like a, I had a guide who was a Taiwan knees, like you sick this banner. He was working in a doctor's office, but on the weekends we found out he was pretending he was the doctor

Speaker 2:          02:09          who's seeing patients, his own patients. But he's a physical therapist and uh, um, orthopedists office. So I go in there and I've been doing this awhile and again, I've been in so many awkward situations now I'm doing stand up and I'm even more awkward situations and I just go up and I go, hey Twon, you know, Jig is up. I go, today's your last day. We find out what you're doing. He grabs me, puts me up against the wall, he gets one of those physical therapy sticks, you know the big, like the pole that you stretch with behind your back and stuff. And he has one of those cut in half and he sticks it right up to my throat. And now I'm cool. And so I go, Twan, I got, you got two choices here. You're going to hit me with that stick and I'm going to call the cops and I'm going to press, you're going to go to jail.

Speaker 2:          03:00          Somebody piss. He hit me with that fucking stick. Or you can take the final check that's in my breast pocket right here and walk away. What's it going to be? And I'm held up against the wall by my throat with the fucking stick, our face and so had some crazy situation. So I'm, what did you say to him? You said the Jig is up. I know you're not a real doctor. Yeah. I go, hey, how you doing? You shouldn't be here right now. We know you're seeing response. No, this is not true. You know like in Chula, like you going to go, he spoke English. Yeah. She's a physical therapist. You banging chicks too? I have no idea. I would liked it to be that way. Yeah. That's a better story. If there's a way to heal you. I lost my car. So I had Russian nurses running from me and just crazy stories like why were they trying to do too?

Speaker 2:          03:46          Yeah. Uh, well this Russian nurse was in an allergist's office and she was giving wrong doses to the kids and stuff of shots. So I had all my documentation, like these yellow pads that goes, there's, um, we, you see, right. I'm 22 years old. You can see right here, Dan, she tries to grab it now. It's a tug of war across a desk and I don't know what the fuck is going on. And um, she takes off and runs down a hallway and I'm 22 and I go, shit, I fucking run down the hallway afterwards and she goes into a patient room and 10, she locks the door and then I get the door open and she told somebody to unlock it and she's in there and she's talking to her husband on the phone. She goes, I'm through, there was a mum here who's telling me lies. He's telling me lies.

Speaker 3:          04:28          I didn't want to tell you this. I am pregnant and I'm going to lose the baby because of his mom.

Speaker 2:          04:36          Oh my God. Totally freaking out. So I had a tea to teach. A bunch of Vietnamese people had a shit and it was one day I got a call. Wait, I got a call from the sky issue. Well they were her mungs. Okay. You know what Hmong is like if you saw a grand Torino, that movie with Clint Eastwood, I think the H is silent. I think the h m o u n g is and yeah. And then there are people without a land. Yeah. And then they call came to San Jose, California to work in assembly plants. So they're in this cable assembly pant. A plant called Cable Co. That was a big client of ours. And I got a call from this really cool guy. His name is chip chip bronc. And he goes, Al, you got to get down here. You're not going to fucking believe it.

Speaker 2:          05:25          And I got a situation and I go, what is it? And it goes better. You see when to go into the bathroom, Shit. Everywhere. What? Cause they had never been used to toilets. So they were standing on the toilet seats. I found out that's what was going on. They all had fake names like the names Food Kelly. But you can call me Keith like, Hey Keith, fluke, Lee, can you come here for a second? Can I tell you about this? The shit everywhere. Like on the ground. Yeah, there were missing a toilet seat is not fucking hold you up. So they're waddling up there standing on the standing on the toilets. So they were just used to like shitting and shitting in holes. Oh my God. If they're lucky, you know, in the woods or whatever. Jesus Christ. So have you been lucky? Not Lucky where they hold it forever.

Speaker 2:          06:16          Yeah, just backed up. It's becomes a brick. Yeah. So, um, anyway, I gathered everybody around. I just appointed a bathroom monitor and oh my God, a bathroom monitor. So I had one on the guys who was a supervisor. I had a clipboard. I put a lock on the map room door. And then, so you become this corporate fixer. That's what I was doing. And I always wanted to do standup comedy. I love standup comedy. I grew up in the city, which is listening to comedians on the radio. And all the great comments was two comics who lived on my block. And so I love lived on your block, Mike Pritchard and Michael Meehan, two great comics. Mike Pritchard, one the first San Francisco comedy competition. And Ron Williams looked up to him and he was like, [inaudible]. That was his idol. And he was on my block. And you don't money Hoffman. Yeah, money Hoffman. I would be eight years old on my bike and I'd ride down the block. And Mani Hoffman and Mike Pritchard used to put their tee shirts over their heads. You know how you can do like just the face pops out of the hole. And they used to pretend they were the California raisin guys. You guys are hilarious. This is amazing.
