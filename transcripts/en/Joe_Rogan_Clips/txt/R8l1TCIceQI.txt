Speaker 1:          00:00          Should've thrown a knee. Did you watch the chocolate? They'll fight. Uh, just the end of it. Yeah. No good. Right. How old is he now? 50. Yeah. So there's hope for me. Oh wait. He lost ships. Well, you've never been knocked out the way he's, he's been knocked out so many times. I don't think I've ever been knocked out. Not In the gym. Not over flash. Flash knockdown. That's it. Yeah. I've had concussions been knocked out from like falling and the rain falling off a second floor landing when I was a kid. Right. But in finding and never [inaudible] chucks also, I think there was an issue with his style because his style was so aggressive, aggressive that people could just set, set, set, boom and counter like Rashad Evans did with him. And so you're getting his momentum coming forward and the Cheyenne, we get flat line.

Speaker 1:          00:55          He doesn't change. No, he doesn't. No evolve. He had a style that was incredibly affective back in the day. Yeah. I think he became married to that, that approach. You know the approach that works so well on Bob Ballou so well on Tito. In the early fights, he was just a marauder. You could hit him in the face of the fucking crow bar and he would just spit metal out at you. You didn't give a fuck. He was so bad ass back in the day. He relied on that so much. I remember all the Mohawks. Yeah. Everybody was a little kid. Yeah. That's how I like to wear Mohawks. Back in the day, people were getting in Japanese symbols tattooed on their head because of him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just, that's that style. There's, this comes a certain point in time. You just can't do that anymore. You know?

Speaker 1:          01:41          I think, um, I dunno, like it's a martial artist, you know, and, uh, artists evolve and they're like, oh, well let me try this new paint. Oh, let me try the, this, this new technique. Let me try this shading. Let me, you know, start sculpting. Let me try. And I think with, uh, especially MMA, you know, there's so much opportunity to evolve, just add new, new, new nuances to you as an artist. I mean, I think that's what I love about it. There's certainly is, yes. But one thing that does happen when, when guys try to add a lot of things, like sometimes they'll try to like say a wrestler will add a bunch of things to his repertoire, but then they stopped with the wrestling. The wrestling is not as sharp and so then when they go up against a really good wrestler, they falter and then they're, they don't have what brought them to the dance and the first place.

Speaker 1:          02:37          Yeah. Yeah. But I think that's just, uh, looking at your opponent and what's in front of you. And also like being honest with yourself and like, like right now I'm looking at getting back into fighting. And if I didn't feel the sharpness, I didn't, I didn't feel the fire and not just the fire. If I didn't physically feel the sharpness, if I didn't feel the reflexes, I'd have to be honest myself and say, okay, don't do this. Do you think that you were Oh, 100% be capable of being rational and objective about what you can do right now? Yeah. Yeah, because I don't, I don't fight for participation awards. Like, Hey, I'm a, but there's some UFC fighters are like, I'm a UFC fighter. Right. Yay. I've made it. Like that's not really making it. You're just another, you know, like say I'm a world champion. I'm a the best in the world. Emma that's, I'm a UFC fighter is like a participation metal basically like level. It shows that you're a very high level fighter. You're not a champion in your eyes. You and champion. That is what's important. You want to be the queen. You want to be a top of the hill. We went to the best of your best self, you know, self. Yeah, yeah.
