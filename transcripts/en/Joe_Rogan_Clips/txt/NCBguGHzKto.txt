Speaker 1:          00:00          Her low freak bitches. It's like, cause I, I promote a lot of things, you know, we might disagree on but you know, I promote a lot of ideas in science that I've seen the evidence for and I've seen a lot of it and we disagree. Um, you know some dietary things I would guess like, cause you know, we can, we can put a hash them like what are, I don't know. What are your thoughts on Gmos? I think genetically modified foods is apparently almost everything that you buy at the supermarket. Okay. What did we agree on that then? Probably, and it's like I think they know you by every orange. If you look at a piece of corn, oh it's organic. That Shit is genetically modified. It's been modified for a hundred years. You're going to make me cry. Tears of good Kevin full time before I was so happy I had him on because he's never in California.

Speaker 1:          00:43          Brought a, he, we went up, we don't end up for dinner that night. So he takes a lot of shit because Monsanto has funded some of the studies that they've done. But the studies are real and the studies of, I mean you can see the results. They're not manipulated. Yeah. Kevin, it's, well actually you know what, they funded his communication programs so the heat can come out and do things like this and they never funded any of his research. I misspoke and said, no, no it's fine. It's uh, but you know what, here's a, and this is what, where he got a lot of shit was, um, was that he said I have nothing to do with Monsanto. Um, and like I think if he just said, you know what, they fund my communication program but they don't have anything to do with my research.

Speaker 1:          01:22          Nobody would have a, I think people still would have been mad, but I think people would have been far less mad. And I feel so bad that he went through everything with that because there was no, it's tricky. I mean I just took a tour there and I got hate mail and it's, I mean we were so careful cause I was out there for other business and they were like, oh you're going to be out in Ma in Missouri, come have a tour. Like they didn't pay and I had so much fun like it was, there was, they have a lot of really cool tech there and if you were ever in the area they'd gladly, I show you around so they're there. They were nice to me. I was funny. One of the, one of the rumors that I heard about that was that they only have organic food in the cafeteria.

Speaker 1:          02:00          I'm like, I'm taking, I'm taking my camera around and taking pictures of everything. The word organic, what's organic and organic uses pesticides and that's something I think people see it. Yeah, absolutely. I mean I thought that was the whole point of organic. You don't use pesticides. No. I'm sure there are some organic farmers that don't use any possible. What defines organic food? Let's find out what is the accepted definitions of organic food? Do you want to hear it from me? And then from, from Google to see if I'm accurate. All right. So organic food works by certain farming stand or agricultural standards and they can use certain pesticides. In most cases these pesticides are derived from natural sources. I'm not always, but most of the time and some of these pesticides includes pesticides like rotenone and the pirate thrums and also have, if you're familiar with bt corn, the bt toxin is also used in organic farming for the, because it's a naturally occurring a toxin, it can be used and sprayed topically on organic produce.

Speaker 1:          03:08          So a lot of these, uh, the things that we think of as just conventional farming practices definitely use an organic farming. It doesn't make it any better or worse. Um, it just, in a lot of cases it's a little more expensive parcel because of the certification process and partially because it uses older farming techniques that need, you know, a little more land, that type of stuff. It also uses till farming practices that, you know, digs up the ground a bit more and can release a little more CO2. So in general, I tend to, Oh, here we go.

Speaker 2:          03:36          Here we go. Simply stated, organic produce or other ingredients are grown without the use of pesticides. Synthetic fertilizers, excuse me, hold on. Sewage sludge, genetically modified organisms or ionizing radiation. Animals that produce meat, poultry, eggs and dairy products do not take antibiotics or growth hormones. The U s hold on, sorry. The U S Da National Organic program defines organic as follows. Organic food is produced by farmers who emphasize the use of renewable resources and the conservation of soil and water to enhance environmental quality for future generations. Organic meat, poultry and eggs and dairy products are made from animals that are given no antibiotics or growth hormones. Organic food is produced without using most conventional pesticides. Fertilizers made with synthetic ingredients or sewage sludge bioengineering or ionizing radiation before a product can be labeled organic and quotes a government approved certifier and specs the farm where the food is grown to make sure the farmers following all the rules necessary to meet Usda organic standards. It's

Speaker 1:          04:41          now the one thing on there that will disagree with what their first paragraph, as I say, without the use of pesticides. In the second paragraph, uh, it says organic food is produced without using

Speaker 2:          04:50          most conventional pesticides. You see that slight little slight of hand because one of them is theirs and the other one is Usda. Exact little slight of hand.

Speaker 1:          05:01          I mean, uh, if you, if, if I may ask,

Speaker 2:          05:04          would you, would you like to Google? Hold on a second. Let's Google what pesticides can be used and still make it organic. Exactly what I was going to request. It's a organic pesticides approved for use in the u s here we go. Now what are the fears of pesticides? Right. People worried about toxins getting into their food, getting them their body and cancer. I mean

Speaker 1:          05:30          I understand that fear partially cause I went through it quite a bit. Like when I got sick a few years ago, like my first symptom wasn't celiac disease. It wasn't my joints popping out. I got the worst headache of my life one day and it never went away like that. That'll make you scared to death of everything around you. Like I went organic, I went Vegan, I went, I'd cut everything out of my diet cause I was a scared that, you know, like you get, you feel like you're getting stabbed in the eye, constantly going to cut everything out of your diet. One day were said and I was working and um, at the time I wasn't working in the pesticide lab yet. I was working at a drug analysis lab. What was going on? Absorbs. Well, it was, I was um, the thing that I was worried because I was, at the time I was all those, there was much more siloed than the rows here.

Speaker 1:          06:19          So day I was, there was much more of me and there is here today I was, I'm, I'm five, nine and I had at the time weighed almost 250 pounds. I, I needed to lose a little of me, but it was like, all right, I'm eating shitty food. I should probably try eating healthier. But I mean, nevermind just more salads. I'm like, I went organic, I went, I just cut everything out of my diet. So as a bunch of issues it wasn't, but I mean, yeah, like I cut a lot of things out, started working out everything. But you know what? I still needed medication cause it turned out there was just um, a, uh, it was just, I had, and then we figured out the headache was linked into the ehlers Danlos Syndrome and there some to, to clarify everything. Some people, when they have one autoimmune, they can tend to cluster.

Speaker 1:          06:59          So there's, that's, I, I, I was lucky color 1 million, but that was, that was the thing with it. But I tried, you know, I looked into this and I fell for all of it. Like, so all of the pesticides are killing you. It's the toxin. So I mean, I understand the fear of the people who were like, I need to cut toxins out of my diet. Do, is there any foundation in truth? Nothing. No. Well, no pesticide. Here's the thing. There is a little bit of truth that sells. The lie is what? I will give this because I, you know, I used to work with bulk quantities of pesticides at my last lab and that was kind of what sealed the deal for me. That these when they're in your food are not gonna hurt you. Uh, because the amount of testing we had to go through and the amount of regulation, I think regulation in this case it's a good thing because it will stop a bad pesticide, uh, for making it to market.

Speaker 1:          07:50          And I want that regulation there because I eat the food too. I don't want anyone's child to ever get hurt from something that, that me or another, like I don't work there anymore. But you know, that, that I had any, uh, work and getting on the market. I don't want to ever want that to be the case. Um, but once upon a time, the pesticides we had in the market were much less targeted, uh, to hurting the weeds and could hurt people too. Like arson are cynical's a sulfuric acid. Those were early pesticides, Paris Green, totally toxic, especially to, uh, to the farmers and to the, even to the farm equipment. The stuff we have now far less toxic. And I mean people say far less though it's toxic. It's in, I mean, I'm going to qualify this answer and I mean I'm not, I'm not qualifying it to back off from it, but everything is toxic in some dosage.

Speaker 1:          08:36          So, yeah, exactly. But I mean, so roundup is one that people are really scared of and it's one that a lot of people know about. There is a great graph on, on this showing how less toxic it is than the, than the pesticides that replaced because we weren't, we didn't go from using no pesticide to using roundup. Um, and I know someone's going to correct me saying it's an herbicide, but on herbicide is pesticides the blanket term for all things that killed, uh, stuff in farming. Um, so before, um, uh, before roundup, I believe the one we used was Cyanna seen, I could be wrong on this, but the one we used before roundup was in terms of the LD 50, the lethal dose for about 50% of the population. It was 10 times higher than roundup. And now we barely sell any of it.

Speaker 1:          09:22          So the issue just lethal dose toxicity, toxicity that affects your body cause cancer. Right. It's, I and I understand that. So a question that, that people are, you know, keep coming back to, and part of the reason that people are suspicious of it is because of its use with a GMO and the, these things go through hundreds of tests and years of testing. And because of the suspicion with roundup, it's gone through continual testing. Like they've tested to see if it, uh, if it accumulates in breast milk, it does not. Um, they've tested, tested to see if it causes cancer, doesn't seem to. Um, and they've tried, they've used it at higher doses than it would with mice and rats. They've, they've, they've tested in humans and it's been on the market for 30 years.

Speaker 1:          10:05          But I mean, like it's been in the population or it's been used now for I believe, 25 years. And there doesn't seem to be the only, the only apparent increase in cancer is because we're living longer now. And when you have any population that lives longer, you have increased incidence of cancer. Like we're not dying from polio anymore, so we're dying from something like, unfortunately we're not going to live forever. So there's toxicity issue when it comes to roundup or when it comes to any sort of pesticide, herbicides, herbicides are what kills the plants, right? Absolutely. Kills bugs or pests. Pesticides are, it's the blanket term. Insecticide kills bugs. So pesticides the whole blanket term yet. So what is, what's the most controversial is that roundup, roundup is controversial. And I think the reason that it became controversial is because people heard, all right, you have to genetically modify the plants so that the roundup doesn't kill the plant and it's this whole thing just to make money from Monsanto and how dare you make money.

Speaker 1:          11:09          Um, and that's, I think that was why people got mad was because of the genetic modification. Lincoln with roundup. Um, and it's, you know, it's a new technology or you know, it's, it's one of a, it's a newer technology and it kind of made people a little aware of farming for the first time. And like I go to farming conferences a lot of times to talk about how to communicate agriculture. And I'll sit down and ask farmers, you know, what do you plant, why are you planting it? What do you think of Gmos you use roundup and do you buy from people other than do you buy from Monsanto? And do you buy from people other than Monsanto? And that handful of questions will tell me. I mean, if I, I wish I had more videos of this, but like there's, there's a video at some point on my site, a with two farmers who buy from Monsanto and buy from other companies.

Speaker 1:          11:55          Uh, and one of the reasons I asked that is because there's a rumor on the Internet that if you buy from Monsanto, you can only buy from Monsanto. Just not true. Uh, that, you know, every genetically modified crop is, uh, is, is, you know, just is made to be roundup ready. Again, not true, uh, that you know, that people are, you know, are being, um, that, that people are dying of cancer from just being around roundup. And recently they found that one of the reports, uh, that went through the IRC, the cans, the place that declares things cancerous, you know, on their, you know, Group A, one, two, a two, a two, a two B, um, cancer, uh, classifications. One of the reports was falsified a that declared roundup cancerous. Now we also have to fall back by the person who is, I'm, I have to hunt down this report.

Speaker 1:          12:45          Uh, but the person who was trying to say roundup is cancerous because of a little bit of suspicion around it because it's been, people have kicked around that it's causing cancer or you know, that your spleen to turn radioactive for you know, forever. And it's just like a chem trails type thing a little bit. One of the things that people talk about in terms of conspiracy theory and it just, it gets put into the public sphere so much that people start to believe it. And here's the thing, if I saw from evidence that roundup had caused issues, I would say right away, just get rid of it, take it off the market. And I keep on not seeing from evidence of it, like one of the, there was a study, there's this group moms across our moms across America. Um, and it's, I take, I always get my scientific information from mom groups on the Internet.

Speaker 1:          13:31          Um, but this group, uh, decided to do a breastmilk study to see a frowned up cumulated in breast milk. And the way the study was done was they just had women indiscriminately sending containers of breast milk, uh, to, to them. And they declared like the amount of roundup to be ridiculously high in the breast milk. And I'm like, do they just tell women to spray like pump bottles, like of, uh, of roundup into these containers and then test it? But it turned out, and this is just from knowing how analytical techniques work, like I used to design the techniques by which we extracted a target pesticides from a matrix and analyze them on our, on our big overpriced, uh, machinery. But the, uh, a woman who was a breast milk, a researcher out of a University of Washington was like, this doesn't seem right. So she designed an experiment to, uh, to test if roundup was accumulating and breast milk and she had it verified by an outs by an independent lab, um, and it, and they tested women specifically who worked in agriculture and she had their breast milk tested specifically on days where they were spraying roundup and there was nothing found that someone who's not necessarily eating the food, that someone who's working with the food well working with roundup.

Speaker 1:          14:44          Right. And you would expect that if it was being sprayed well, the think about it this way, when I'm eating it, it's both, think about it this way. If it's in the food supply, um, wouldn't they be eating at as well?

Speaker 2:          14:56          I don't know. I don't know what their diet is like if you're, if you're getting it from people's breast milk and those people say, there's roundup in my breast milk and I've been eating genetically modified crop.

Speaker 1:          15:06          Well, the other question is if these are the people that are following a moms across America and their whole thing is that roundup is the devil, they're falsifying evidence. I think that it was not a well controlled experiment and it would be interesting to see, um, to see how, um, the experiment would come out. Um, if the person who runs moms across America, Zen Honeycutt would work, would, how it would look if zen were to look in on every step of the process with a Shelly Maguire, Dr Shell and Mcguire to see that, uh, you know, these people ate food that should have been sprayed with roundup, uh, and worked in the field and then at the end, uh, to see if their breast milk came out with nothing yet,

Speaker 2:          15:48          don't you? Don't you think that there'd be more likely to be some sort of conspiratorial collusion with people that actually work in farms that use roundup rather than someone who's just checking the, their breast milk? It's like, wouldn't you think that like if someone's trying to prove that roundup isn't showing up in breast milk and you've got a bunch of people that they're living relies on using roundup,

Speaker 1:          16:12          well, the farm workers themselves, they'd want to be safe. Right. Mandy, and I say that as someone who's worked at a pesticide company and when I worked there, I mean I was, I was just an analytical chemist. I'm not someone who had any investment in keeping that company safe from being yelled at. I want it to be safe from the stuff I was working. Right.

Speaker 2:          16:30          Find it weird that you feel like there's some sort of conspiracy with these moms that are checking their breast milk, but you don't think there might possibly be some shenanigans involved in the people that actually need roundup to make a living?

Speaker 1:          16:42          It's no, I understand what you're saying for sure. But part of the reason why I think that a Dr. McGuire would have conducted a better study was number one in pa, independently verified a number two knows how to do collection, uh, evidence or not ambulance, a specimen collection accurately. And number three monitored and independently verified from an outside lab. So it's like we don't have, and when, uh, when moms across America was asked, uh, to show their data and how they collected the samples, they didn't give, they weren't willing to, to share, uh, their, all of their data on how specimen collection, uh, was, was handled was their excuse for not sharing the, I don't recall off the top of my head, but they weren't like, it's, it seems suspicious to me that they weren't willing to disclose that. I mean, when you're, when you do an experiment, everything, and I mean I used to work under GLP standards, which basically you throw out a glove, you have to write it down.

Speaker 1:          17:38          And that's, that's part of the standards and how you get, you know, a chemical into, uh, into use in agriculture is you really have to be careful and, and forthcoming on how you do your work, which is the amount of pesticides that they found in breast milk uniform. It's, I believe that you didn't find, I think they were only testing for roundup and they found there to be, they didn't find there to be even trace amounts, which I was kind of surprised that I would have expected something moms across America stuff they found a lot. It was a uniform. Was everybody have like a similar amount? No, they found it in the amount of varied and they were there were so high. It was like, it was just, it was suspicious and that's why I was like, I don't like that was why I didn't buy it.

Speaker 1:          18:22          The other thing is they used a technique, an analytical technique that was used for water. And that's why I'm like, this is not like not all techniques you use for all work for all chemical matrices. So that's another reason why, you know, a different lab, uh, was probably better equipped to handle at one specifically that analyze this breast milk. Um, so it's, I think like at the other thing is, you know, that the other lab, the other lab kind of had a bias going in because their whole thing is how roundup is bad. So lab, it's like, I just want to know if, you know, moms are being harmed, if there's breasts, if there's something in the, in the breastmilk that seems like a lab that, you know, went in just wanting to know the other lab went and saying, I hate roundup. So if, you know, I would have, if, if roundup had been found in, uh, in the test that Dr Mcguire's lab had done, I would have happily accepted those results because it, you know, it almost wouldn't, it would have surprised me, not in the least if, if it had been found, but I was kind of, I was Kinda glad that there was nothing there because it means that, you know, babies aren't getting a concentrated dose of this, uh, just because you know, you don't want extraneous chemicals going into the food.

Speaker 1:          19:32          So I only testing people that worked in these farms is that, was that the idea? I think they did. I don't remember off the top of my head, but I know one of the people, one of the groups, they did test for women on testing days, but they go to this way. They're not just spraying it. They're also, you know, possibly eating food that's been, uh, that's had it on there. That's possibly, it would be more interested in seeing 100% sure that these people were eating food. That makes sense with roundup. And that doesn't make sense to me that they didn't do that. It's, I'm, you know, I, I'd have to, I want to have a look at the study again in myself just to be, just to be sure of what the other conditions were curious about both tests have I have a look.

Speaker 1:          20:10          Um, we can have a quick peek a after it for Dr Shell and Maguire breastmilk roundup study. The whole thing seems a little weird to me. It's weird that one group tests high, one, two group test. Not at all. It's, it is, I'm going to say it is easy to screw up a study using, um, if you're not sure the parameters you're supposed to use in an analytical, uh, in, in a chemical analysis thing because you can have interfering species that come up with the same peaks at the same time. Uh, so I'm, the other thing is, like I said, we, the biggest thing is don't know the collection parameters for the one that mom across America did sign. They won't tell us. Yeah. I mean it's, the other thing is Dr. McGuire was doing it through a university and she could've been, she could've been a lot of trouble if she falsified a or data or done or done a test that was purposefully misleading. Right. So what are the pesticides? Did you Google the pesticides that are,

Speaker 3:          21:10          yeah, both. There's a, from the put 'em up, uh, there's a long list somewhere, but the, uh, I had it right here. It's on the USA or usda.gov website. It just, it's like a, the standards of what they use to put stuff on and off of it. Okay. And there are a organic standards that allows some substances, but where they're mostly trying to get out synthetic substances. However, there are also some synthetic substances that are allowed to, yeah,

Speaker 2:          21:39          interesting. And this is to label something organic,

Speaker 3:          21:42          right? And then there's a board that votes on it from time to time. If somebody wants to bring something up and disagree that it shouldn't be on that list.

Speaker 2:          21:48          Isn't that weird though? I mean, most people think he say organic. Most people think there's no pesticides. Most people think you're just growing plants.

Speaker 1:          21:56          Yeah. And that's, it's an, I mean they, they saw that so well don't they?

Speaker 2:          22:03          For instance, for Mons Pheromones, pheromones, pheromones, pheromones. Pheromones have long been used as effective, nontoxic waste to confuse insects. Hmm. Well, that might otherwise in fest organic crops, especially fruit. So they put some certain smells just freak bugs out. Likewise, vaccines for animals are important. Disease Prevention tools against many infectious diseases, blah, blah, blah. Especially since antibiotic therapy is prohibited in livestock.

Speaker 1:          22:35          I'm picturing an anti-vaxxer staying away from organic produce because they vaccinated it against bees.

Speaker 2:          22:40          Well, you could always grow your own food, folks. You know, and not put anything on it, but I think large scale domestic agriculture, if you're talking about these gigantic fields, nothing could be less natural. It's not normal to have a thousand acres of corn. It just doesn't exist in the wild. And when you do that, you're going to run into a lot of problems.

Speaker 1:          22:59          Since I always go back to the argument of nothing we're doing is natural anyway. We're sitting in a, in an air condition studio in, in California that we, we'd probably be, we'd be dead with a lot of the things that we, we don't have that's, that's, you know, come out food. There's no food around here. Where are you growing food? It's, no, it was, no one's grown food anywhere near us. There's, there's nothing that we enjoy that's, that's natural. Any more ice creams? Not Natural. And it's God Tam. Delicious. I'm going to get a freezer. How do you get a freezer?

Speaker 4:          23:36          Yeah.
