Speaker 1:          00:00          There's some scientists making weed now. I mean they've gotten, they got real botanists involved. There's money in it now and now that it's opening up in Canada, it's going to be really weird because in Canada they're making it legal, right? It's legal now. So um, I'm pretty sure RJ Reynolds is that who it was and we just dumped a shit ton of money and did some marijuana production in Canada that's going to file suit in the United States. It's, there's too much money involved in it and it's going to be good for everybody. It's going to be good for capitalism. It's going to be good for people getting marijuana as long as regular people can sell marijuana to let fucking Rj Reynolds, as long as they don't put some restrictions like they were trying to put, was it you Jamie? They told me about what they were trying to do in Ohio where they were trying to make it set up where you could, you could grow weed but only a couple companies could grow it so that we would be legal, but only a couple of companies would monopolize.

Speaker 1:          00:52          And then everybody was like, fuck this. But Dad ended up passing it. I believe that's terrible. It's sad that that mean that's such a corruption. That's like saying, okay, you could have tomatoes, but we're the only ones who grow these fucking tomatoes. Like why? It's a tomato. That's a law against nature. So you're saying that nature can't take place. I can't put a seed in the ground and grow my own shit. Get the fuck Outta here is illegal. It's illegal. Okay. How's it different than corn? How's it different than a fucking, uh, a pear tree? It's not. It's a legal life form. It's a life form. It's a plant. You're allowed to grow it. And if you say you can't grow it, you got a corrupt system. You got some bullshit law that you weaseled in because he greased up some assholes and the other people don't have as much money as you do.

Speaker 1:          01:34          So the only reason why that ever happens or people are so desperate to get legal weed that they let some dickhead dominate the entire industry. Some greedy. Fuck. Now the deal is it's legal or it's not legal. Otherwise we're in some sort of a weird dictatorship. You know, this is not, you can't just decide it's legal, but you're the only one who gets to make money. Fuck you. It's a plant. That's crazy. Imagine if you owned all the pine trees in the country. Donald Dominique, my country, my pine trees. You want to buy pine? You buying it from me? I find you in a fucking Christmas tree. I'll take you out crazy though. What happened last week? We call [inaudible]. I don't know. In New York. You said he's wants to legalize weed. Oh yeah. He wants to make it recreationally legal in New York. Stupid to shoot down. You should be making money off of it.

Speaker 1:          02:22          It exists. No matter what you do. If you're a capitalist, if you're, you're a person who believes in a free market. You already have whiskey, urea, half pills, people can get high. They're not so just, they're just not. Stop with the childish arguments. Give the fucking people freedom and make money off it. You dummies. That's what everybody should be doing. They should make it legal and profit off it and it will. It shouldn't stop with that either. It should go to mushrooms should go to a lot of different things. They should set up clinics. She set up places where people can go through mushroom therapy. People that suffer. They're coming back from the war. PTSD. You know, there's, there's so many different benefits for depression, uh, people that are getting ready to, to, you know, to pass away. They have extreme anxiety. A lot of that is alleviated by mushrooms. People that have gone through extensive cancer treatment and realized their terminal. One of the best things for these people as mushrooms is that it helps them ease their pain and suffering. And they'd last dying days. And it doesn't seem to have any negative effects, you know, other than the occasional person losing their fucking marbles, which is going to happen no matter what you do. It's something that should be studied and it shot something that should be free and it could benefit people. So it should be fucking legal.
