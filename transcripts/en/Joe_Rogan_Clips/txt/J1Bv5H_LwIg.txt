Speaker 1:          00:00          Plus this China make it to the moon. They grew cotton on the moon apparently already. Right. They grew something in the moon but it died. Yeah, it died quickly. I was happy that it was that cotton because seeing as how they're their biggest investor in Africa and China was growing cotton that didn't go well for black people 500 years ago. So I was just like, please don't let cotton grown in the moon. I don't know what the trends move. Atlantic slave trade, the start and I have to learn mandarin and shit. So you do you think they actually set up shot before us or as American steel number one because they feels like, I feel like we lost that day. We went, China landed on the moon. Yeah. I feel like I feel like, oh shit. You know, you know I've grown up being, you know like I'm black, I'm American, but I like, I come here, a lot of people I'm saying I live from here.

Speaker 1:          00:44          I like America. Yeah, exactly. I feel like we are bad. Like Frederick Douglass. When asked would he leave? Was I, and I answered, you know, like what the fuck am I going to leave for when I see something like the moon landing the China, the growing the plants and landing there, there what, what, what exactly was it? Was it, uh, what, what was the kind of ship that they landed on the moon? I'm going to put one on the morning. Apparently some type of role on the dark side though right on the side that we didn't make it to her or just went and told him he got a video of, it was a drone, right? He said what? It was some sort of a drone. I think of that. I honestly think about that as a win for science and for innovation. I don't think about it in terms of like nations cause I feel like that is done by scientists.

Speaker 1:          01:23          That's done by the wizards and the, so are you saying we're going to steal the scientists because when Kennedy gave the fucking speech, Kennedy made it seem like the moon landing was going to make us the preeminent nation. And I think that's the propaganda China's going to run it. You don't think, well, I think they have some fucking amazing technology and to deny that would be ridiculous. But I also think that it's important that everybody, everybody be competitive in this. Like if they, if you really want to make things better, you're not gonna, you're not going to do that in a vacuum. Gotcha. What helps the technological innovation and one of the reasons why it's so accelerated is there's so many people working on it. It's not just a few people trying to make cell phones better. I got fucking so many geniuses out there, so when I see something like this, like they landed on the moon, I go, did geniuses one you just gave me hope.

Speaker 1:          02:08          Yeah. Yeah. They're Chinese people, but they're just people. We're all just people. Absolutely. You know, and the idea that they're going to all get those people on that side to think the same way is what we're worried about. Right. That we're, it'd be US versus them and their technology is going to impact our lives the way we frame it as the country. Yeah. We always worry about that, but you have to admit that that's what, that's the way we frame it. But if you look at the history of the world that's been, that happens so many times. I think it makes sense to be worried about the rest of the world. I get it, I'm on it and I'm on this side of the fence, so no problem with that. But you know, you know I'm an American, so you definitely want to know if it's, if red October is going to happen tomorrow, fuck man, I think Russians don't hate us.

Speaker 1:          02:49          I don't think anybody has a quarrel with anybody over there. It's the the government's. It's what's the hustle is that the real interaction is between a very small amount of people that involves all, these are the people that are with them. For some strange reason, I think they should just be thrown essentially in a stadium to fight to their death would be the king of the word. Fuck everybody up. And that other dude that runs the other little country next door that was on real sports. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That guy is a huge supporter of MMA. Fucking bad ass. There's some bees over there. You know bad Putin would fuck up Trump. Oh Christ. You can't fight to the death with Putin. I where I would actually probably bit poon versus Obama too. Yeah, for sure. Look, Obama is probably better than it. Debate. Yeah. Pools a real, exactly. That's what I'm saying. It's a real cat. You'd have to go all the way. Bush one I think was bad ass. Maybe as a younger man, I need you to leave the CIA. You gotta have some killer in. Yes. You know, he was a tough guy, but I probably have to get all the way back to Kennedy in terms of physical prowess, and his back was bad. I think you've got to go to Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln. Yeah, he was wiring. He wasn't that farmer bill farmer strength. He did.
