Speaker 1:          00:00          You know, when you get off of like, you had like one of the most spectacular fights with Jon Jones, I mean down to the wire, like is as close as it gets and when you get out of a fight like that, will you all most won the title against the greatest of all time? Like what is, what is that feeling like and where do you go from there?

Speaker 2:          00:20          Uh, you know, uh, it was tough. It was really tough because I know everybody was saying like, you're winning this fight, winning this fight. You had three rounds against him. Are you winning this fight tonight? If it felt like, like you said, it was something, it was just, it was just right there at the goal line. You know, I didn't really pass that goal nine at all. Um, I just felt like I knew it was tough. It was tough, but, but, but like now I'm sitting here now talking to you. It's a big, it's a really good experience for me. And, and you know, I really, it's a good time for me. If I was a w e is a highlight in my career for sure in my life for sure.

Speaker 1:          01:01          Well, it's such a close fight when the, when the scorecards are being tagged and you, uh, you know, you're just sitting there waiting for the decision. Did you think you hadn't,

Speaker 2:          01:11          you know, I didn't know. Right. I didn't know. I didn't know much chaos. Could you even remember what had happened over the last five rounds? I remember, I remember, I remember the, I remember the fight, uh, and I got, I remember almost the whole fight, but it was just John. John's just such a basis. He, I'm telling you, just for me, John Jealous, winning over John Jones is bigger than taking the belt. I'm filling that guys. The guy is such a beast and, and uh, yeah. What was the question?

Speaker 1:          01:46          No, it's okay. Being Express yourself. That's fine. I mean, I agree with you. He is a beast. You know, I'm very disappointed with all the stuff that's happened to him obviously, and especially the most recent one, which I really, I really believe based on the evidence as a mistake, I think, I think he got ahold of something tainted because of they, they tested him before that he was negative. They tested him after that he was negative and what he tested for with such a minuscule amount, there's no way it was something that he, yeah, there's no way, like according to Novitsky and according to Usada according to like how they test people, what, whatever he consumed, it must have been an extremely small amount. It wasn't an amount that would have had any benefit whatsoever in terms of performance, performance enhancing.

Speaker 2:          02:29          Well they know their thing. So, you know, just let the, you know, expert handled that. I don't know what to say. I know for a fact that he's been in that same situation a couple of times. This is not the first time. So he definitely is a wild motherfucker. Hayes Hayes. He definitely does some Shitty, probably shouldn't do but a hundred percent man. But, uh, I mean, but the thing is, it's so stupid because he's, what is he? He's the best guy, pound for pound out there. He's done things nobody else has done is he, he's just a beast and still shit just comes up all the time. He doesn't even need that steroids. He doesn't even need that shit in them. He's still the best out there. I don't think he took anything. I really don't, but I, but I agree with you on that. And I think you need a guy like that.

Speaker 2:          03:23          You need a guy like that out there. Like to bring you to your full potential. Do you agree? Yeah, I agree with you. I agree with you. Yeah. No. Like I said to you, fighting him and beating him, that's bigger than taking the bumps right now. That's how I feel. Because he's, look what it did to DC, man. Yeah. And do you see is tough history that he finished DC? Yes. That's just insane. It's just insane. And he finished him with a kick that DC said he's never going to hit him with. Yeah. That's crazy. That's insane. Yeah. You Never gonna hit me with that left thigh kick. Oh, blam yeah. Just look for the opportunity to fix it. Yeah. Tendencies are crazy. It's just some of them just get so ingrained in the way your body moves. No, he's, he, he's an expert at what, of course, what he's doing. And he's, he's studying his opponent very well. Uh, everything is just such planet in details for the fights and he just, he knows exactly when he should go for that or that or that. And staying creative and use news fantasy. And it's amazing to see. Yeah. That Jackson Winkeljohn team is truly exceptional team. I mean, they really did do phenomenal with him.
