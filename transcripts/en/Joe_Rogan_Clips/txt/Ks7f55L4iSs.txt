Speaker 1:          00:00          Do you guys want to go to Phoenix to see Cain fight in Ghana? You want to just fucking get on with it. Is that it's like, it's Sunday. It's a Sunday. I could do it. I'm thinking about just fucking flying to Phoenix. I never go to a live USC as a fan, but I want to see Cain versus in Ghana. In the arena though. 100%. I was going to snipe me out. It was going to stop you. Oh, I don't know. Days with me. Well, the four of us, the of us go live. We'll put fucking snapchat cameras on our eyeglasses. What? What is the date? It's crazy. It's a Sunday night. It's the 17th. We check every free coun. Yup.

Speaker 1:          00:43          You got me down for that. Would you want to do, do it? I'd do it. Take a private jet as long as it's not this weekend talking to Eddie indicting murdered fun man. That seems stressed about it. Oh, look at this boy. Your boy's got good. Uh, you're, you're a DM buddy has got good takedown beef. Yes, that does. Cause he knew he's fighting a wrestler, Bro. Oh, blocked second round. Two rounds for the, for Ben, they had two friends. Canes. An epic fight is an epic fight. I really, how about this? Not even, not even a little bit epic. Here's why. Why? Because Mr and Ghana all due respect. Great Athlete. Two years. Okay. Once again, Keynes had 150 surgeries. How it goes. He's 37 years old. A fake skull. How it goes. Ready? Okay. Is it lower down and then punches in the face until it's over? I don't think so. It might not to be like Jds, I think can get to a hundred I hate to agree with Brian, but yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:48          never agreed on anything. It's true.

Speaker 1:          01:53          Wrestling, you went to knock them out like jds did. Cain wins, but I don't think he gets a single. I can just take some technologies and shows him getting his head in his chest and his bank. JDS in Ghana is fucking dangerous unless you have cardio. He shown something to fight. He didn't know what the fuck he was doing. He thought, well, the Steve Bay fight, he thought he was gonna win that fight by chaos. He thought he was just going to go out there and Kale. He did land good shots on top Curtis blades and that second fight and Curtis blades is a good wrestler in, Jeez. What would be Mark Curtis plates in that second fight? You got to remember he just fucked up Curtis bleeds. I totally forgot about that and forgot about it. That's why I went for the FCA. And you're gonna have a hard time getting in the arena

Speaker 2:          02:37          companion. Hey guys, there's a fight. Let's get more. Be Funny to do a fight companion, but travel, I always travel so, but I was thinking we're going to be taking it to the bottom on page

Speaker 1:          02:50          a party. Have a good time.
