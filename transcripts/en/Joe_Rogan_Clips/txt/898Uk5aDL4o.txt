Speaker 1:          00:00          The casinos in Vegas or they're, they're probably gonna want to do this fight next. That's where they want it because they want all that extra gambling money in restaurant money and show money. Right. That's where I would likely, I would, I would say it's likely gonna wind up, you know, got a lot of places, you know, I wouldn't mind going back to New York as well, garden me, you know, you got so many diverse people there, you know, a lot of people look at travels and stuff like that, you know, all those, it'd be busy and stuff. You know, people want it still to be easy access. He, Vegas, Vegas makes it easy for people because you know, the airport is right there and then five minutes away you're on the Strip and that's what most of the people be at and stuff. But you know, we're, we'll see when the time comes.

Speaker 1:          00:43          You know, I'm open for any, any, any place you go when you guys talking about a rematch maybe, uh, we're looking at April, May, June, somewhere up in there, you know, and uh, we'll see what happens. I'm excited though. You know, he said he back in the gym, he t he hit me up. He sent me a video saying how you back in the gym and stuff like that. And I just hit back him. Likewise because it's crazy because his mindset is being back in the gym and mine's is the same way. You know, I been, I been traveling a lot talking about this fight. Like it's been like I'm already, you know, it in discussion with certain outlets or whatever. It's like we've been boosting up this net, this rematch fight. Like it's, it's, it's almost here. It's been crazy though. This is what my career needed as well too, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:31          Um, so I don't mind, I'd been from La to New York. I'm just getting from New York now. I'm back here and now offering to go to my original home time. I got some things I got to do out there, enjoy the, the holidays. I'm going to take a vacation with my family and then once I get back on back into the gym myself. Well, boxing fans, hardcore boxy fans already knew who you are, but this was the breakthrough fight for the general public. This is a breakthrough fight where people know about it now and the next fight. The rematch. First of all, you couldn't ask for a better dance partner when it comes to promotion. I mean Tyson's fantastic on the microphone. He's hilarious. Got that great accent, listen to him talk. So you guys promoting this and getting ready for whenever that April, May, June, whenever it takes place.

Speaker 1:          02:15          I mean, this is going to be probably one of the biggest heavyweight fights, if not the biggest of all time. Man, I'm just so excited. You know what I mean? Because I can see, I can visualize it now. I couldn't really visualize how big this could become. I knew it was going to be big, but you just don't know how people are. You know, people are funny, especially, you know, people always have things to do, you know? Nailed it. There was nothing else competing with you. There's nothing else there to watch. It was perfect. It was a perfect storm and then it was in Atlanta, so stars came out. It was a big deal, man. It was amazing. And I'll never forget it, you know. Excuse me. Like I said, I've been waiting for this. I've been waiting for that moment for so you know, they don't have this problem in the UK because no matter, no matter what, they love boxing.

Speaker 1:          03:04          It's the second nature of sport. They don't have college sports and professional sports that they had to deal with boxes. Like I said, they're second nature of sport and you know, Eh, you know, they don't have as many as people we have here to here. Like what made me 66 million, something like that. Uh, Alabama and Mississippi, they can fit UK in Alabama and Mississippi combining them together, but they can fit the whole state and in Texas and still have space, which over here we got so much. We got how many colleges and professional sports and you know, boxing is like probably the last sport, you know, on the list. You know, I probably, you know, exaggerating with that a little bit, but it definitely seemed like that we definitely, you know, in the back and there's so much to compete with. It's so, it's so hard here to do it. And then when you, when you, when you finally get that shine, you know, that's where it comes from. You know, when a minute, and when you're in it and you understand it, it's like how it's so hard. It was to get it to get to this point, you know, down there 11 years and like to get to this point. And then when you finally get here is like, you were here.
