Speaker 1:          00:00          Well, you went and lived in like last time I talked to you, you were living in Japan and you were doing Kendo over there. Yes. Uh, well you pitch up. Awesome Day. I'm going to play for the Yankees joke. I love just uracil and grapple and someday I want to get in the middle of the ring and Joe Rogan's going to saint my name and I'm working my way up through Ed Parker's American Kampo system. And someday I'm going to Japan to learn from the guys who invented this stuff. No, I'm putting on a pork barrel, acts it to make it entertaining. But it did. And I started exactly like I did Barham Boulevard making rock and roll with the Mighty v Mighty van Halen in the late seventies, uh, at the Oakwood garden apartments in midtown Tokyo. I did not know a single person. I didn't know a syllable of Japanese.

Speaker 1:          00:53          I had no idea where I was. And No, I can't drive on the left side of the street. I barely carry a cell phone. Karen, come on. And, uh, uh, I suspect that a lifetime of adventure you do all the traveling come on artists to artists, your home everywhere now, aren't you? Yeah. A lot of ways you are the comfortable one in the room, especially if there's conflict, which there always is and that's what's the most unsettling to the, to the tourist travelers. You're at home when you first start learning Japanese comes in three stages. First you watch kids shows on television because they pronounce everything and nobody interrupts. Then you watched the news, everybody speaks with a perfect accent, bigger words, nobody interrupts. And then you start going with me to the movies in the middle of the day on Tuesday and Tokyo, it Ginza and you're the only pale face in the room.

Speaker 1:          01:50          It's all in Japanese and it's the movies. Everybody's interrupting everybody shooting, screaming, sirens, airplanes going by. And if you can begin to decipher even one character, then you'll develop yours. Ma'Am, do you know how to write it while you practice that? Certainly. And think of it as cross training. All right. There are a lot of schools, for example, a Hebrew school, you always hear about Hebrew school before you go to bar Mitzvah class. It's an ancient way of wait a minute. You got to develop the side of your brain by correlating designs with language, with meaning that may not actually be an English. Nobody's walking around speaking Hebrew after all the only four summers of whack. But you develop that side of your brain to where you start to have a capacity to learn in an accelerated way. So all your best musicians speak a couple languages.

Speaker 1:          02:43          We are best politicians. Speak a couple of all your best artists, architects, all your best design folks and speak a couple of language. It's no secret that you develop that side of your brain. If your kids don't speak Spanish, get after it. I had to learn a language. It's never too late. You'll see the difference. You don't. I did every single day. Every time I called it Roth University in Tokyo, every morning, two hours, Japanese class, you know, speaking the language. I can get things done for you, but I'm not conversant. You follow? Uh, the end result is that it's cross training. Hmm. Alright. Longterm memory. My short term memory is a little too short. It gets shorter, but you'll see the difference in your ability to remember what you read. They'll start remembering everything. You see some things as dangerous because of the fact that you learning this new thing.

Speaker 1:          03:42          So you're activating this part of your brain. Oh yeah. You'll start it off with little kids in art class for example, where you take a pencil and you got this, just a pencil. What else could it be? Well, in this environment is a stick shift, blah. No, it's not. It's a Kubo time. He's got Joe's rested now I'm a little girls go, it's a bow dad. Me, I'm a hero. I'll say of the day. And you get start to think in those terms using actual language movement. Same thing. At this point in your career with Jujitsu and grappling, you have a vocabulary that starts to expand, expand by having to learn and challenge and challenge people. Marvel at Anthony Bordain gun blessing. Uh, one is biggest talent was to be at home everywhere. No matter what somebody might say or a posture or present, he was able to let it go by when later, or no, we'll Duke it out right here. And he had the capacity to stay cool in the middle of all of it. So maybe it's stay cool school when you think, well, he just had a fascinating mind for travel and food and culture, and he just wanted to know everything about how these people thought about the world and saw things differently. And if I feel, I kind of feel bad now for people that don't travel, I really do feel like you're missing so much of what a human being is.
