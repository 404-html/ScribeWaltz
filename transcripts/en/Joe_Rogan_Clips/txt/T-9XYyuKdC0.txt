Speaker 1:          00:00          And it's like, what am I going to do? Biceps and chest. It's over. Hey Dude, to 25 ever again. Yeah. That was my workout since I was like 18. I'd go in, nothing. Nothing changed. It was two 25 years. And then let's do some curls and a, you know, neglect the abs and go home. The legs, no legs. Although I did have a, I played soccer growing up, so I did have those, uh, soccer lakes. I got like Earl Campbell thighs.

Speaker 2:          00:33          Yeah, soccer is one of the best exercises ever. I mean, it was also a great way to blow your ACL out. Totally. Everybody's, you know, it's shifting left and right and all that. There's a fucking picture, you know, big boy, the a, the a, the Dj, his fucking son. There's a video. He retweeted it. His son is a football player and there's a, there's a video of his son where, you know, someone's trying to tackle him and he moves like a fucking ghost. It's incredible. You watch him like it was one, one of those rare things where you see something and you're like legitimately impressed. Like, Holy Shit, I watched it like five times in a row. This kid's footwork is incredible. Yeah. But footwork like that, kind of like, like who's in better shape than soccer players? They're constantly sprinting dog games like you and you have to maintain that stamina. You're constantly sprinting.

Speaker 1:          01:26          There's a lot of mileage you're putting on in a, in a soccer game. Although you know what gives me and you're, you're, you are probably going to laugh as well as your listeners. Believe me. Pickleball, you ever played pickle ball? What does that pickle pickle ball. It's like pennys and pink Pong. And you played in a gymnasium. So it's like a, it's a net and it's, you got paddles and talk about moving side to side. It's, it's fun and you burn a ton of calories and you do it in a gym. You didn't have an gym and like a, like a basketball court. So it's like racquetball, but there's a net, there's a net. So it's a bouncing off the wall. You're, you plan it like tennis. It's, yeah, it's a court, small net. And you have, uh, like in Venice, those little small courts, it lot of old, hello, my name is Fred.

Speaker 1:          02:22          This is, listen, you're going to laugh. All right. There's a lot of old people that play this, but I'm telling you it's, this is embarrassing. So you each have your use for people. Yeah, you could do doubles, but me and my buddy play just one on one and I'm telling you it's not, it looks like it's not only fun, but you, you burn a lot of calories and you don't even know you're doing it because I'm diving and it's, uh, it's one of the exercises that we, uh, we really enjoy it when he's got you doing and he's got you doing polities pickle ball. What's next? I have no, he's working his way. He know what he's working towards. I don't have to tell him. I'll call you. I know a lot of 68 year old people play this, but, uh, if you're looking for a low, uh, kind of impact, fun activity, uh, it looks good if you're looking at it and go, oh, it does.

Speaker 1:          03:23          Tennis is fucking hard. And it's man, it's another thing. This is like a, this is like tennis reduced to a smaller court basically. Probably Healthier for you. It's not as hard on the ankles and the needs to, it's not as hard. I will have to go after we have our steak, we would one go to him. And of course in Venice beach. That's what I thought it was. I've always seen these small tennis courts there and I know really what people were playing. So they're calling it paddle tennis. Yeah. Maybe. Maybe this, but this is what, this is what it is. These guys look ridiculous. They should just go home. This is outrageous. What are you doing sir? I'm telling you. Put a little English. Listen, I grew up ping pong. I'm really good at Ping Pong. Yeah. So this is like a larger version of ping pong.

Speaker 1:          04:11          Yeah. It looks like it's fun. All bullshit aside. That looks like a good time. It's fun. Believe me, I know your listeners at night and left and right now, but I'm telling you it's, it's uh, it's, it's good. So that's what I'm doing. Show. So you take your trainer with you on your road on the road. That's the move. Where's this? Where'd you meet this guy? I've known him for 20 years. I met him on the set of days of our lives, doing extra work days of our lives. When I first came out to la in 1998, I was the type of guy, I would do these weird like mailings to get work right. So for days of our lives, not, gee, it was general hospital, General Hospital, take a headshot and then take a post it note. And I would write on the post it note ready to operate, stuck it could had shot and I sat it out. So I would do these like weird little mailing. Oh, you know, maybe the personal opened in the mail will go, oh, I get a little chuckle and whatnot. So I met him doing extra work. This is what I used to do, uh, for, for some extra cash. And uh, we became fast friends. He's an Italian kid and uh, w w w similar upbringing, middle class. He's from New York. I'm from Chicago. And, uh, just a great, great guy.
