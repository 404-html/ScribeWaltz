Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah, I mean, I guess that's like what it must be to just be in the Amazon itself as well. Right. And you're sharing the jungle, not just the rivers and the lakes or whatever's out there, but the actual jungle itself, it's, it was incredible. The jungle there. So we were in Columbia and Amazon and like talk about untouched by people. There has been this kind of ongoing going conflict in Columbia for many, many years. So we were the first westerners to go there and over 60 years. So the village we flew into, they literally never seen white people before. And then we went 200 kilometers from that. So like middle of nowhere they want to touch you tell yeah, hair because their hair was very dark and very different and like, I'm not particularly fair, but just to touch like the hair and see the blue eyes and stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:39          They were just a lot of friendly, super friendly. Like the culture was very stoic. Like there wasn't a lot of smiling or crying, you know, there wasn't like a lot of emotional exchange, but straight away they came and greeted us like shook hands, you know, said hello. Um, it was really cool. Wow. That's gotta be, you know, how do you set something like that up? Do you have like a liaison that does like acts as a go between, between you and the tribes? Um, yeah, so we did in this case have one guy who communicated, I speak Spanish, Spanglish, I guess. Um, and they all speak Spanish from back in the day. So we set it all up. It's part of the wildlife stuff that I do. We, we literally flew a DC three, a World War II cargo plane into this cocaine dealers airstrip. And then God, that's how we got there.

Speaker 1:          01:23          I mean like mind blowing stuff, cocaine dealer, a former former former, yeah. Well, you know, too CBD, it's still Columbia. Right? Exactly. Um, so yeah, I was, that one was really cool. It really remote. How crazy is that? They learned Spanish from people who came over on boats from Spain and it just stuck. Isn't that nuts and took over the whole like regions. Yeah. The whole world and, and series this tribe in the middle of the Amazon that has this language from another continent and Brazil, right from Portugal. Right. It's really incredible when you stop and think about it. I mean it's, it's incredible, but it's also part of, it's a little sad, like why wouldn't you have loved to have heard what their original language was? Oh, I was literally what it sounded like. Well, they did. So it's funny because when they didn't want us to understand what they were talking about, they would switch to their native Indian language.

Speaker 1:          02:12          So they still had, they were bilingual, a community of 25 people that have never left, and they're bilingual. Wow. It's amazing. Now their native language is what, what does it, it's an Amazonian Indian dialect. I, I honestly don't even, they might have said the name, but I don't recall it. What is the name of their tribe? Uh, also not even sure they're, they're so isolated. They're unaware of what country they live in. They don't even know that they are in Columbia. Really, really, they're just like, to them, they're Amazonian, they're not Colombian. Ecuadorian Brazilian there. They're Amazonian, whoa. Yeah. You know, they just stay, they stay. And the village we were in is literally, I think it's all over 200 kilometers from the next next village of 15 or so people and they don't have fuel. They don't have, you know, they'd just

Speaker 2:          03:00          in this pocket and they just substance live and they're all barefoot, right? Yeah. Do they have those crazy splayed out feet? Big Feet? You know, they're, they're not very big people. They're like small Indian people, but really big kind of useful feet and the way that, you know, they could run up and down trees and climb stuff. I mean it was unbelievable. Like so much more athletic than you could imagine. What imagine right there. They've been doing that their whole life, their whole lives. Now when like when I say splayed out feet when I'm talking about is that people that walk barefoot in the jungle for long periods of time with their whole life, their toes spread out and their feet almost looked like a hand. Oh, no way. I did not pay enough attention. That might've been the case, but I didn't know this at their feet.

Speaker 2:          03:43          Exactly. Yeah. It's kind of weird thing. Stare at Dude's feet. Yeah, for sure. But um, yeah, Steve Rinella, who's a good friend of mine told me about that. He was in Guyana and is the same thing and they actually got some pictures and videos of these people's feet. But look at these guys up there. Hello? Oh No, I didn't notice anything like that. Yeah, this is the, uh, that's uh, oh. How do you say that? Horror. Not Horani. Horani Horani sounds right. Or Ani, you think where Ani Horani Indian splayed feet. So it's very strange. Like it's the kind of the opposite of what happens to women when they jam their feet into those little pointy shoes, whether they get the, the, the toes kind of smoosh onto each of the La fee. Yeah. It's horrible. Instead of that, they're all like crazy spread out. What in the fuck is going on there?

Speaker 2:          04:32          Because I talked to his hands, I think would, yeah, the tops hands. But the bottom is like would feet, but that's, that's gotta be like what? Our feet are supposed to be probably right, right. Yeah. Fic Ass toes that actually have muscles in them that move that you can use like a tool like your hand. Yeah. So when these guys just can climb up trees with them so they grip the side of the tree with their feet like a hand. Oh, I mean I didn't notice, like I say the feet just like that specifically, but the way they could, like everything's covered in mud down there. Right. It's all wet. It rains every day. And they could run up and down these tree trunks, like to get up and down the village. And here's me and my crew with our awkward cameras and stuff and where it's slipping and sliding and falling over and like they're, they're literally like, what's wrong with these people?

Speaker 2:          05:12          Why can't they walk? We must have looked like infants to that. Right. And you guys probably have like boots on and Shit fucked up and oh totally. Yeah. We're wearing, you know, muck boots and my one buddies got waiters on. And you know, we think we're all hard and cool because we got all this gear and they're just like running around in shorts barefoot. It is so fascinating when you see people that don't have contact with the outside world. Like, um, I'm sure you're aware of that recent story of the missionary was killed by the people in north central island. Absolutely. Which is one of the weirdest places cause they've branched off from Africa at 60,000 years ago or something like that. Right. When you're around these people, like what, what do they do if they get injured? So funny you asked that because we, we kind had that same

Speaker 1:          05:57          question. Right. And they don't leave. They stay in the village. They have a shaman at the village who blessed us with a crazy green powder and that's a whole nother story. But they have a showman and he is their doctor. However, he has no access to any Western medicine. So it's only his learning knowledge handed down through generations plus jungle powders and whatnot. And um, and that's it. So we actually, we spend today because we had a medic with us doing like kind of village help if you will. Everybody had ringworm, everybody had respiratory infections. Uh, there were a lot of lady problems in the village that our medic had to deal with. I mean there was a lot of health issues and you don't even realize it. Write something down before I forget. I'm sore as totally unrelated. No good. There's a doctor named Peter Hotez that's coming on the podcast and I have to follow up on him.

Speaker 1:          06:47          He, when you start talking about the people in the jungle, he was, he's a actual, a doctor who is a, he specializes in infectious diseases and jungle and tropical climates and he's like, everyone's infected with something. Everyone, everyone, he'd have a heyday down there. I'm sure it's probably been, yeah. But um, the, so when these people have ringworm and all these different infections, do they treat it? Do they have like some natural pathic cure or some shit? I think it's kind of a 50, 50, like a lot of it they don't treat because it's just part of everyday life. Like when I say everybody had ringworm, I meant everybody had it. So I don't think there was any kind of treatment or cure. It was just kind of part of it, part of them, but other things, you know, the, the, the witch doctor or the Shaman was trying to treat and then we kind of went in and we had like medication for ringworm, so we'd dewormed everybody and with the Shamans blessing and he was like super excited to have western medicine in the village.

Speaker 1:          07:42          And what'd you use? Like Lamisil or something like that? I couldn't tell you. Um, I think it was not, it wasn't topical. I think it was like a Wehrmacht like a pill that you take that kills the, kills the worms. The weird thing about that is like, don't you, you leave and then they're going to get it again. Right? I mean there's only so much you can do, right? Yeah, totally. That we were having the same dilemma and it was like, do we interfere because we're from the outside world? Do we help? And, uh, we talked to the sham and through our translator and he said, please help, please help. So we gave, including him, everybody just dewormer but you know, they'll just come back. Yeah. And also they probably don't understand the consequences of taking some antibiotic that's going to do some weird shit to your whole biome.

Speaker 1:          08:26          Right, right, right. And these are all that stuff too. It's such a moral dilemma. You're there and you're like, I want to help. Do I, is it helpful? Is it hindering? Our medic was like, it's undeniably going to help, you know, they need this. And so we got, we went for it and it was, you know, it seemed to help, everybody felt fine, but we were only there a couple of more days before we left. So who knows? Wow. When you're talking about ringworm, like these guys covered in it, they have big patches of it. Like what's it like? Feet and legs had big patches of it. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          08:56          And this, if you don't know that's the same shit that's athlete's foot. Oh, I didn't know that. A ringworm and athlete's foot of the same kind of funk. Oh yeah. That's why, uh, they people tell you to pee on your feet. Oh, I thought that was just for fun cause it depends on what you're in. But uh, I think that's a, the idea behind it is that you're, um, somehow or another you're killing the bad bacteria. You, uh, you're pissing on your feet and you have athletes, what, that might be horseshit maybe. Yeah. With me, you always have to check. Um, yeah, definitely give that a little see. But, um, it's a real common thing with Jujitsu. Gotcha. So guys, all the maths, that's real common. So just it guys get it and there's people really fuck up or they like put bleach on it and a bunch of different things to try to kill it and winds up getting worse. And also it fucks up all the natural skin flora, jock, itch, athlete's foot and ringworm or all types of fungal skin infections known collectively as Tinea, Tinea, tinea. They're caused by fungi called Derma trow fights that live on the skin, hair and nails and thrive in warm, moist areas. The jungle. So it seems like they're just going to get it

Speaker 1:          10:07          it. That's just what it sounds like, you know? But what do they do for it? I didn't see them treating that at all and when we pointed it out they're like, yeah, yeah, we know about it. You know, they were more concerned with things that were like dire, like there was an infant and maybe not even maybe three years old and he was hacking up a lung and he was asthmatic according to our medic. So my, our medic gave them like an asthma medication and he just said, you know, if he has an attack where you kind of breathe, give him this and like you know, to be super real with you. When we walked away our medic was like, I doubt he'll live to see adulthood.

Speaker 2:          10:39          Oh Man. Yeah. And will you given them inhalers? Did you give him, I'm not sure to be honest. What it was that he left with him. And what about like injuries? What if they break a leg or something like that? What do they do? I don't think anything was any, I mean you got to think these people are climate trees

Speaker 1:          10:55          constantly fall, get bitten by stuff. There's tons of venomous snakes out there. It's wet, it's muddy, it's slippery. They're building stuff out of very rudimentary tools. I mean it's, it's nuts. They have to get injured.

Speaker 2:          11:07          It's so interesting that we have this understanding of medicine and doctors and hospitals, but that's probably pretty fucking recent.

Speaker 1:          11:17          Oh, of course. Yeah. I'll, I'll tell you a story. Joe. I was in a Myin Mar early, late last year and we're down there filming this thing and this kid, like 22 year old crab fisherman gets bitten by a crocodile crop, grabs him by the arm, grabs him by the thigh death roles so it breaks the arm and like, I dunno, 15 places, compound fracture, the real deal. I could show you pictures out, it'll blow your mind and we hear about this and we're minutes away. We just, it's kind of one of the similar situations where the first westerners to be there in a long time. We go bombing over at high speed and we get there and the mom is like off mourning the death of her child, but her child is sitting there still alive, like they have thrown him off and it's mom. His mom is literally mourning the death of her child and he's, he's lying there conscious.

Speaker 1:          12:03          But like in total shock, fortunately just because of the situation we had a speedboat, everything else, we bandaged him up. You know, ted tried to keep his arm stable and his leg stable, put them in our speedboat and it was six hours by speedboat to a village that had a or two to a hospital really. And so he got there and his life was saved. But I asked, we asked the people in the village what were were you going to do? And they're like, there's nothing we can do. Wow. So he was just going to bleed out or go septic. And that was the end of it.

Speaker 2:          12:31          Ooh. What a fucking rough way to go. Right. How did he get away from the crocodile?

Speaker 1:          12:37          Uh, I don't know. I think he was just hitting it or hammering on it. He was crab fishing in the water and it came up and grabbed him, rolled a few times and at some point he escaped how we even got back in the boat and made it back to the village. I have no idea because his leg was shattered, his arm was shattered. It was brutal. And it was a canoe, you know, it wasn't like he had a little motor or a wheel to drive canoed back.

Speaker 2:          12:56          One of the most disturbing stories I ever read was, um, these guys were kayaking in an African river and the guy in front of them got grabbed by a crocodile and that it went under and the like, it like plunge like a bobber as the crocodile pulled him out of the bottom of the Kayak. Yeah. I'm like, fuck, that's awful. Imagine being the guy behind him and washing them.

Speaker 1:          13:18          Yeah. And knowing that you're pretty much helpless. Did you see any jaguars or anything? Uh, I've never seen a Jaguar. I've seen a lot of la. I'm from Africa. I don't know if you knew that, but, so I've seen a lot of lions growing up. My family did safaris. Um, and then I've seen, you know, mountain lions here in California, leopards, stuff like that. I've never seen a wild Jaguar. Really? Yeah. When you were in the Amazon, I think they're really elusive. I know there's areas that are our hotspots. All of the locals were very nervous and kind of knew about them. Like, you know, I went out for Bush walks at night and stuff and I'd just go, me and one guy with a camera and a, they were like, oh, be careful. Like pedigree also in a very dangerous, don't do it. Um, but Predator Grosso means very dangerous belly grow, so like danger. Yeah. And I'm so we just go and, you know, I'm not trying to act like we were tougher than them or anything. We would love to have seen one, but they were very aware of them. So they were there. We just didn't happen to run into one sort of

Speaker 2:          14:11          mountain lions. Exactly. Yeah. Like they say that mountain lines are like, if you live in a place that has them, you know, Wyoming or Colorado or something like that, they know where you are. Right, right. They might be around you all the time and you might rarely see them. Exactly. Be Driving home and see one skittering into the, into the,

Speaker 1:          14:28          gosh, there was a nuts video, I think it was from the La area. Did you ever see it where the security cams picked up this mountain lion that was walking through this like very residential neighborhood and you'd see like people would walk by and then 30 seconds later he'd like dip out of the shadows and then dip back in and then the next set of people would walk by and nobody had any clue he was there. Yeah. It's crazy. Was a giant Predator can move around like that. Right? Yeah. So when you're there, what, what would you have done if someone got bit by a venomous snake or a spider or something like that? Did you guys have any antivenom? Were you prepared for something like that? I mean, that's my department, right? Like, as the wildlife guy that's, that's Kinda my, my department is make sure nobody gets bitten, make sure nothing like that happens.

Speaker 1:          15:08          And we handled very, very many venomous snakes and caught anacondas and all kinds of great stuff. We did have like my main camera, Guy's name's Mitch, he got absolutely lit up by these wasps one night and we all were, we got like 12, 14 stinks each. But I look back in the canoe at one point and his eyes are just super swollen. He's bright red, he's sweating. I'm like Mitchie okay. He's like, uh, his throat started to close up. He was having an allergic reaction so we had to hit him with anti histamines and I, I'm not actually sure if the medic administered the Epi pen or not, but uh, he was like, we're in the middle of the jungle. We're six hours from a village that's then a full day's travel by a charter plane from a hospital. I mean middle of fucking nowhere. And uh, and his throat's closing up and think that's why we take a medic with us. Thankfully we had this emergency medic, he administered the Anti Histamines and Mitch was okay, but these things do happen to ever like while you were on these crazy adventures, do you ever out there going, this is the last one? No, no, no. Whatever. No Way, man. I love it. I live for it. Wow.
