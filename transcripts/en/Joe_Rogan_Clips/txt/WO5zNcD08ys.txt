Speaker 1:          00:00          Now there's no public support for lobbyists, right? There's no, there's no people out there that are super psyched that lobbyists are out there and exerting their influence on our world. But they obviously have enormous financial backing behind them and they have incredible influence in our, in our culture. But if you had some magic wand that you could wave across this system and fix it, wouldn't removing lobbyists the one of the first things that you would do? No. No. Why? Why so? Well, because look, you know, Congress, especially in the current government legislates on a whole bunch of issues that they don't have a clue about, right? They don't know squat diddly about 99% of what they're legislating mouth. They need information. Um, one of the other things Gingrich did was to completely may C8 Congress's own information service. They used to have a really powerful information service that help congressmen figure things out.

Speaker 1:          00:58          All of that basically gone. So they rely on outsiders to come in and help them understand it. Now, my view is, you know, that's an imperfect system because there's great inequality among the quality of lobbyists. But if all lobbyists were doing was providing information like, congressman, here's what's going to happen. If you pass this bill, like these jobs will disappear or this lead will reappear in the water system if that's all they were doing. That's a really valuable thing. Information to the Congress to help congress decide but to do is an essential part of making democracy work. The part of lobbying that is the corrupting part where they become the mockers for the money. Not so much that they give it directly, but you know, they call their clients and they say, you need everybody at the c level in your corporation to send $2,700 to this person, and they steer it like that.

Speaker 1:          01:52          When they become the kind of source of a resource for members of Congress, that's when they have this influence, which is not related to their argument. So you know, I've met lobbyists who, who hate the system as it is right now. They'll say things like, look, I want a system where I win because my ideas are good. My arguments are better. I don't want a system where I win because I'm able to channel more money than that guy. Cause that's not a democracy like a democracy should be. These representatives are listening to us and then they do the right thing based on what they think helps their constituents, not how much they're going to raise if they do this over that.
