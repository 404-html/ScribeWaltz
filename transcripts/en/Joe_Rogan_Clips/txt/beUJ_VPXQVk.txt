Speaker 1:          00:00          There's studies that compare testicle size of different civilizations and different cultures. There's a lot of argument about this. And the problem is that the print that it's racist, it's racist, right? That's what underlies a lot of it. But we get scared, right? So the thing is that, that the, the um, the genetics, it explain why one animal or one species would have large testicles. In other words, a small testicles are not the genetics that would explain why two different individuals in the same species would be that way. Because the only way to make that latter one work is you have to inherit a constellation of traits. So if I'm in a hair, the genes for big balls and for impulsiveness and for having lots of kids and not caring much about him and all the things that are supposedly go with that, that do, when you look between species, there's no way for those, that constellation of traits to be inherited together.

Speaker 1:          00:46          Cause remember I was talking about how polygenic everything is. And so they'd all literally need to sit next to each other on the chromosome if they've got any chance of being passed on as a package and they don't. And you also get all the shifting around her in Meiosis. Um, I can't remember the term for off the top of my head, but where the pieces of genetic material move around and that virtually guarantees that you're not going to inherit this huge constellation of traits within a species between species is dead easy. You know, you're a species inherits big testicles and inherits impulsiveness. It inherits, you know, whatever. Uh, and our strategy just reproduce a ton and ignore them. You know, all that kind of stuff's dead easy. And so CIM fathers don't pay any attention to chimp babies to speak of because while that's their mating system, right?

Speaker 1:          01:28          Whereas, um, you've got pair bonded Gibbons and things and now parents start to play a much bigger, even male parents start to play a bigger role. But there's no studies that show that human beings with archer testicles tend to ignore their children. Well, so this is just it. People have tried to show that. But here's the problem. I tried to show that studies. So lots of people make that argument and it's called life history strategies where you say, well, you're going to develop one life history strategy in these circumstances and another and these other circumstances. The problem is that you end up with ethnic differences in testicle size, which we know exist. And you also have ethnic differences in where in the kinds of lives that people currently lead. The difficult thing is it's super easy to look at the world we are in right now and this is what tripped me up earlier as well.

Speaker 1:          02:10          You look at the world that we are right now and assume, well, that's the way things have always been and they haven't. And so right now, you know, the uh, mathematics used for a while, they're the best math in the world was taking place in the Arabic world. Now it's not anymore. And so if you, if you don't know that past, you'd say, well look, people in the Arabic world aren't as good at mathematics and they have these qualities and that you'd make an inference right now the ethnic differences in testicles, I believe, but I can't promise you that it's some different west African groups happen to have the largest testicle size on average. Um, those west African groups tend to be poorer right now. There's lots of things about life that go with being poor that looked like and our strategy having lots of kids and paying less attention to them. But what you're probably looking at is a coincidental association between some biology and some, uh, some way that your, your people happen to live that didn't exist a while ago and that won't exist a while from now. And so it's really easy to try to use this research, which people have to say, well, you've got some primitive people who have big testicles and low parental effort and you've got some more sophisticated people with smaller testicles in the high parental effort. But that's genetically super naive.

Speaker 2:          03:18          One of the things that I learned when I was in Rome, we took a tour of the Vatican by this guy who was a professor. It was really interesting. It was cool because we used to have a, a really enthusiastic guide and who, who could explain a lot of things to you. And he was really excited that, you know, me and my family were very curious about these things too. But one of the things that he said that was really interesting, I said, okay, I go, why all the dudes have little dicks, like what's going on with that? And he said that they believed that if you had a large penis, that large penises were a symbol of barbaric behavior and that these were crude or people. And that to be, you know, thought to be a sophisticated person. You wanted a smaller penis. So they actually accentuated smaller penises in their gods and smaller penises and their statutes.

Speaker 1:          04:08          And that's funny. I mean, you can see these kinds of things all the time. So early pre western contact. Uh, if you look at Japanese women, they're pinned, they're painted with their eyes as narrow of a slit as possible post western contact. Now the women want more almond shaped eyes and so they start painting them with the beautiful women have bigger eyes. These things can change all over the map. I personally suspect that large penis sizes also product to sexual selection. So it's more fun for her if he's got a larger penis or having sex for longer and more regularly because obviously patients hidden. So he has to be available all the time. So she has to be available all the time or the system doesn't work. And that's what creates pair bonding. So humans copulating for a very long period of time. If you compare us to the other primates with the single exception of Bonobos and we have way bigger penises than any of the other great apes. And I suspect that that's something that is female. I mean women always say, why are men subsets to the penis size? But I suspect that there are the creator of it, and that's why we're so obsessed with it.

Speaker 2:          05:01          Women who say that are playing games, they know that's ridiculous. I don't know that they are. They're definitely playing games. That's like men who are saying, why are women so obsessed with big breasts? We don't even care. I've never met a guy who said that. Everybody has some, some asshole out there that's playing games. Okay. Possibly. You're right.
