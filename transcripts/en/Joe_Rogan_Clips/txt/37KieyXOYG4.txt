Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. I've, I mean, I did. I did one, I did Jimmy Fallon once seeding the Jimmy Fallon and every organization wanting to get me, what'd you say? I was doing a joke, uh, of singing. We were singing these funny songs about who let the dogs out. And so we took who let the dogs out and put it in like a, um, like a, like a Vaudeville or show tune who left the dogs or whatever it was. Right. But beginning of that, I sort of ad libbed like I was watching these dogs and they were coming towards me and I was wondering, you know, who let them out and there was a pit bull there and you know, you have to be careful because pit bulls can be contained, curious, you know, and then I go into the song, the pit bull community, it was like Jamie Foxx session pitbull Seamus, you pit bull shit. And then there was another thing where Jimmy Fallon was doing, um, was doing some type of, uh, he was saying what was going to be in the next show. And I was doing a bad version of signing, which I actually know how to sign, but I was doing a bad version of sign language. I know sounding like we'll talk more about it later, you know, all those types of different things. But as I was doing it as a joke, I didn't know that the person that he was talking about happened to be deaf.

Speaker 2:          01:21          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:22          Oh No. Oh my God. And so then, you know, so it was just all of these things. And I tried to tell people, I said, hey, listen, we never mean anything bad. We poke fun, but we're not, we don't mean anything bad, but you can't just, you know, he can't, you can't kill us. I, and I cause I to keep doing what I do, you know? So it's, it's getting tougher.

Speaker 3:          01:41          Well, it's just what we were talking about, about social media, about people commenting on things that you can't read the comments. There's just too many people and people are always looking for something to be recreationally outraged that in the comments to get that ass through the comment, comment and hit you right where you are sometimes good. Damn. This motherfucker's right. Well it's good to though a little bit. You went there right? When they're actually right. Like someone could say something ridiculous about you and you know it's ridiculous. It doesn't mean anything, but if it's got a hint of truth,

Speaker 1:          02:08          but when somebody says something about your teeth, you, you kind of look in the mirror. I don't understand it. Like I'm fucking, I got, but I got somebody hit me with the donkey, then you know it's fucking donkey. I was like, ah. I start talking like, yeah, I didn't know if I give it a so you know, but I tell people all the time, don't read the comments. That's the book. Don't read the comments because it will make you start to change the way you do things. If I read all the comments, I never tell another joke. Yeah. If I read all the comments, I'll never try another, you know, I got a movie that we just a shot for little or nothing called all star weekend and the jokes are like all the way out there, you know, and I got everybody in it, you know, and we're all taking all played different characters. Like I play a white racist white racist cop.

Speaker 3:          02:54          And how do you do that?

Speaker 1:          02:55          Awesome. I'll show it to you. I'll grab it, I'll grab the thing, show tea. But it's a, uh, Robert Downey jr he plays a Mexican, a Gerard Butler plays a Russian who loves gymnastics. Uh, Benicio del Toro plays this crazy tattoo artist and we're all, you know, we're all doing our thing. So it's like if you read the comments, that'll make you tuck that in. But this is some brilliant and, and it's, it's, it's a cool little thing to, it's, it's called a all star weekend for a reason. It's about two guys. One guy loves Steph curry, the other guy loves Lebron James and all they're trying to do is get to the all star game. And it's sort of like this whole journey of running into all these people. So it's dope. But it is some things where it's like, Ooh, you know, you can see there's going to be some, some shit gone.

Speaker 1:          03:33          But Robert Downey jr just from tropic thunder, think about that. You could never do that anymore. You cannot blackface anymore. You know what? I'll say this, people have to understand where it comes from. There are real people that did it really mean you harm like outside of us. I mean there's some real people who really don't fucking like you. Whatever you are, whether you're black, you're white, you're straight, you're gay, whatever it is. There's some people who really don't with the entertainment and it's easy. We're easy. Targets were easy. It's easy for you to jump on Robert Downey jr or Jamie fives or Joe because it's easy. You know, when it's real things, which you know, whether it's politics or whether it's whatever. A lot of times we, we SORTA, we're not ready for that fight, but it's easy to sort of pick the comedian. I called Robert.

Speaker 1:          04:20          I said, listen, I need you to play a Mexican. He says, dude, here's the deal. Sure, sure. Why not? Fuck it. Sure. Of course, no Mexican, whatever. But then he texts back and said, I'm nervous to play the Mexican. And I said, well shit, you played the black dude and you killed that shit. We're just all, you know, we gotta be able to do character. What kind of blow back did you get from playing the black dude? None. Because we first go for the wire too though. It was like, what year was tropic thunder? I feel like I was like 10 years ago. It was wow. But, but, but here's the thing, we fuck with Robert Downey jr like that's my guy, right? Like I did his birthday party and my first joke was how dare you take all of these roles from black people, you know?

Speaker 1:          05:04          Anyway, everybody's laughing. Have we got, so it's Sorta like the entertainers, man. We sh we, you got to give us room. You know what I'm saying? Like to play any, I'll show you when I, when I to take that room, you got to take it. You can't worry about it. I saw the Chappelle somewhere. It was like, no. They would ask him about his jokes and he was like, Yo man, look, you know, people have said we're a shit. And I think he said something about Donald Trump's saying grab them by the Pussy or some shit, whatever. But it was true. It was like the one thing that you look at what happened with politics this year, people sort of stripped away a lot of things. You know what I'm saying? Regardless of what you believed in, uh, who, whatever person you voted for, it was a lot of things that we'll sorta addressed about, like maybe we're playing things a little too close. Like some of those politicians were afraid to say what Donald Trump was saying and they ended up being left in the dust because people were a little like, whoa. Well, he's, he's got a point in the sense of we're playing things a little too close.

Speaker 4:          06:10          Okay.
