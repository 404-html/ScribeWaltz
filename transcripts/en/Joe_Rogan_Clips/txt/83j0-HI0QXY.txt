Speaker 1:          00:00          I'm on social media now. Deleting social media from your applications, from your phones that give you a 10% boost to happiness. What was, what do you think the percentages?

Speaker 2:          00:14          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:15          I think probably something like that. Yeah, that's about right. Good. 10%. Yeah. I mean, I mean, the only thing I've kept as Twitter because I kind of like need some means of getting a message out, you know? Right. Um, well that's about it.

Speaker 2:          00:33          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33          So far so good. Well, what's interesting with you, you, you actually occasionally engage with people on Twitter.

Speaker 2:          00:41          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41          Yeah. It's what percentage of that is a good idea? Good question. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:56          It's hard. It's mostly, I think it's unbalanced. More good than bad, but there's definitely some bad. So do you ever, hopefully the good outweighs the bad. Do you ever think about how odd it is, that weird feeling that you get when someone says something Shitty to you on Twitter and you read it, that weird feeling, this weird little negative jolt? It's like a subjective negative jolt of energy that you don't really need to absorb, but you do anyway. Like, well, fuck this car for chem. I mean there's a lot of negativity on Twitter. It is, but it's a weird, it's in its form like the way if you ingest it as it, if you like, you try to be like a little scientist as you're ingesting it, you're like, wow, how weird is this? And I'm even getting upset at some strange person saying something mean to me it's not even accurate.

Speaker 1:          01:47          Well, I mean the, the, a vast number of negative comments, uh, Slovakia for the vast majority of, I just ignore them. The vast majority. Yeah. Every now and again you get drawn in somewhat good. It's not good. Make mistakes. Yes. You could make mistakes. Some mistakes. We're all human. We can make mistakes. Yeah, it's hard. And people love it when you say something and you'd take it back and you're like, fuck you, we saved it forever. Fucking screenshot that shit bitch. You had that thought. You had that thought. They were like, well, I deleted it. Not good enough. You had the thought, I'm better than you. I never had that thought you had that thought you piece of shit. Look, I saved it. I put it on my blog. Yeah. I'm not sure why people think that, that anyone would think that to deleting a tweet, it makes them go away.

Speaker 1:          02:39          It was like, hello. Then the Internet for a while. Yeah. Well it's even like anything is, they don't refer you to be able to delete it because the problem is if you don't delete it and you don't believe it anymore, it's really hard to say, hey, that thing above. I don't really believe that anymore. I changed the way, the way I view things, because people go, well, fuck you all right. That over there. I'm going to just take that. I'm not going to pay attention to that shit. You wrote her a needed it. It's on your permanent record. It's forever, Bro. Tattoo. Put this on your permanent record. Yeah. It's like a tattoo. You keep it. Oh yeah. Yeah. Well, it's, it's this thing where there's, it's, it's uh, there's a lack of compassion. So lack of compassion issue. People just like intentionally shitty to each other all the time online and trying to catch me.

Speaker 1:          03:23          Yeah. It's, they're more trying to catch people doing something that's arrestable like a cop trying to like get, you know, arrests on his, his record. It's like they're trying to catch you with something more than they're logically looking at it, thinking it's a bad thing that you've done or the to an idea they don't agree with so much. They need to insult you. I'm trying to catch you. Yeah. I mean, it's way easier to be mean on social media than it is to be mean in person. Yes. Ways or, yeah. It's weird. It's, it's not a normal way of human interacting. It's cheating. You're not supposed to be able to interact so easily, but people were not looking at yes. You would never do that. You'd never be so mean to somebody looking in their eyes. And if you did, you'd feel like shit. Most people, yeah. Unless you're a sociopath, you'd feel terrible. Yes.
