Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. Herod is right near the president's 2017 budget provides 69.4 billion in discretionary funding. Is that, but that's education. Yes. This is for the education bill 139.7 billion in new mandatory funding for the u s department of Education. The budget's supports implementation of every student succeeds act, which embraces many of the reforms and administration along as long supported to improve outcomes for all students. That also makes crucial investments that build the administration's worked to advance educational equity and excellence support teachers and school leaders promote college affordability and completion. These include, I think college should be free. I think we could figure out how to make college free. I'm with Bernie Sanders on that. It's a rare thing. I just don't think you should be in fucking debt up to your ass hole by the time you get out of school. I think that's crazy. It's a fucked up way to start your life and people are like, well, you want to make a little bit of, it separates the people that really want it and the people that no bullshit.

Speaker 1:          01:00          Just get stuck in debt and you can't even get out of that debt. It's not even a regular debt. It's blood debt. Some weird debt but doesn't, doesn't have a more educated society. Help everybody. Everybody in the long run. Sure. How he'll make more money. Everybody would make more money, but you would have to like make sure that whoever the fuck is teaching these kids, like you'd have to be real stringent with what you're letting get pushed through if you're going to throw that much money on it. There's a lot of shit bag and teachers out there. We'd have to clean that up. You know a lot of people is a lot of shitbag teachers out there and I didn't want to give him gun. That's the dumbest shit of all time. I'm like, I'm just the dummy shit. That is the dumbest shit of all time.

Speaker 1:          01:45          Can't you can't expect teachers to become soldiers. That's crazy. That's not what they do. They're not, they're not warriors. They shouldn't be out there. Have a firefights with pilled up, you know, formal, former high school students. Yeah, it's fucking insane. I don't know what the solution to that is. Honestly, I do not know what the solution is. You know, the NRA thinks it's having guns everywhere. The anti second amendment. People think it's getting all the guns away. Um, but you're not going to get all the guns away. The thing about like, people say guns don't kill people. People kill people. I'm like, no, people with guns kill people. They definitely do hear exactly how much the government would have to spend to make public college tuition free. How much do you think it is? Okay, let me guess. 1 trillion a year. Wait, wait, wait. You left way less. Yeah. I would say come on into this article. Okay. What does it say on about it, but what is, what is the website? The Atlantic. Okay. That's a left leaning website but it can not ridiculous

Speaker 2:          02:43          dated. This other article says 62 point $6 billion a mere 62 but there's updates on the bottom of the article that said, that's some readers say that's an addition to what they already spend. So that makes it maybe double,

Speaker 1:          02:56          well, you know, one way they make it really fucking cheap, have it available for free online. Everybody should be able to get an education online. That's what I really firmly believed that I think they should have courses that you could just sign up and take them like a regular college course. You don't have to be in a physical location anymore. That's so retro. That's so unnecessary. Get in your car and get the traffic and go to UCLA. The only thing good about that as you're in the room with someone like a Jordan Peterson or some really good professor that's really inspirational and you're in there with him and they talked to you and like you're like, oh, okay. And you get to like be in their presence and see like, oh this guy was probably like my age one day and he figured all this shit down and like, oh, maybe some extra juice to that

Speaker 2:          03:38          to have a bookmark saved. I think it was Harvard I, it was a long list of us recorded lectures that were from any class. I think there's probably was a limit to what they were doing. Right. Definitely not accessible anymore, especially for the public, but it was fully accessible. Anybody that wanted, that's why I had it saved.

Speaker 1:          03:55          Hmm. I don't know Joe. I mean, let me think about that. Like I said earlier, like all these formulas fit into different things. You say that and it's like you can be at home while you're looking at them on a screen and I'm learning versus being in the same room and it's like, yeah. But like you could also go to a strip club and watch strippers dance or he could be at home watching some porn and when you're at home watching him, you're going to pull it out, rip one. Hmm. You know? Right. So you're saying, let's say it's like if you're at home station home, you just going to beat off.

Speaker 1:          04:31          That's, that's a real problem. You know? Uh, Louis C K was saying once the, uh, he has a computer that he writes on, it's not connected to the Internet because you just can't get distracted. Forced himself to, I think that's what I'm saying. The problem is the distraction with having, having access to everything right there. That's true. Um, when you opened the window with the teacher, that's, that's, that's the part. It's discipline, it's discipline. And that, that goes back to what I believe. That ties back into what I was saying before about all this entertainment out there. Everybody, everybody's, it is always like scratching at you like, hey day, pay attention to me. Give me something to do.
