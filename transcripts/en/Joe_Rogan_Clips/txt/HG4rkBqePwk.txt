Speaker 1:          00:00          Living with monks? Yes. What is it called? Living with the monks. Living with the monks. Um, does your new book? Yes. Why did you start to do that and how long did you do it for? I did it for 15 days. I was enough. That's more than enough, man. Yeah. We're going to go like this for an hour. Your finger all fall off. What are you doing with your finger? Up and down? Just a repetition. What did you have to do? I uh, well I live with, they were, they were eight months, four, which had been there for 50 years. 50 50 on a monastery, 800, 800, 500 acres, kind of in the middle of nowhere. And um, I went for 15 days. So I figured, you know, I, I'd invested so much of my life on the physical side and ran a hundred miles and just always active and this and that and have really invested very little on my own inner work.

Speaker 1:          00:51          And I just felt like, man, I just felt overwhelmed a little bit. And I said to my wife, you know, who are the masters? And everything pointed to monks. And I said, I want to go live on a monastery. There's something romantic about that, right? It's almost like the guy who goes off into the woods to write a book, like being with a, with a monk like, and just being in a monastery with monks. There's something very romantic about that, right. Does that you've shed all your worldly belongings and you no longer care about the day to day nonsense that everybody's fixated on. Just decide to just, Oh,

Speaker 2:          01:26          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:28          yes. Oh, all day. You could do it. I don't want to do it, man. You should want to do it. I've lived the opposite of amongst life. My life is filled with bullshit. I get it. Yeah. Where'd you go? So I went, I went to a monastery just south of Canada in the states. Ah, yeah. But no, what state is it? It was in upstate New York. Oh, okay. Yeah, like on the Vermont border. And it was, um, you know, no phone total kind of separation from my family. I have four kids, my wife and just got to, uh, get to know myself a little bit. Wow. Now, when you were up there, was there any time where you're like, what the fuck am I doing? Like one minute into it, I got, when I first got up there, the main monk, like my goto monk, brother, brother Christopher took me to my room.

Speaker 1:          02:22          They call the rooms that a cell, which is about the size of this table. And I had a bed. I walked in, there was a bed, there was a little desk with a night lamp on it and nothing on the walls. And he said, tomorrow we're going to start prayer, reflection and meditation at 7:15 AM. And I looked at my watch and it was 6:00 PM and I asked him, well, what do we do between now and 7:15 AM? And he looked at me dead in the eye and he said, you think? And I said to myself, I'm fucked. Ah, because I'm like, I don't really like spend a lot of time in thought. So I went and I said, okay, I'm going to, I'm going to meditate. You know, like I'm here, let me start this journey with meditation. I'd taken the little a course in transcendental meditation.

Speaker 1:          03:12          I'm not a big meditation guy other than running. And so I set my timer for 20 minutes and I sat down in my chair and I started like focusing on my mantra. Like immediately I'm bombarded with how it was. My wife had the kids, the hawks, it's like all this, you know, bumping against the Atlanta Hawks. I live in Atlanta, like, you know about your kind of hawk. Everything's coming at me. And um, you know, time is going by and I'm just getting bombarded with thought and I'm like, why isn't my timer buzz like it's been, I've been here forever. So I was going to look and reset my thing. I'm like, that would be cheating. Let me keep going and going. And all the time's going by and, and finally I'm like, fuck is going on with my time or, you know, so I opened my eyes and I looked to reset my timer.

Speaker 1:          03:54          It's three minutes and 27 seconds. No, and I said to my, I like studying, really thought it was 20 minutes. I thought it was like hours, man. I mean like I'd never really sat in a room like with nothing going on and just closed my eyes alone and thought and time to stop. And I calculated how much time I have left, like 15 days times, 24 hours, a 60 minutes. And I said to myself like, man, I'm in trouble. This isn't like, like this isn't what I'm on Gilligan's island. This is a real like I can't get out of here. And I, I had a really hard time with it. What was the commitment? The commitment was 15 days. So the only you, it was a personal thing. Yeah, he did it up to you. Like there was no, nothing in writing. And did you have a way to escape?

Speaker 1:          04:42          I mean I was thinking of escape plans, but I'm on the monastery and this is a little crazy that the way the monks keep the lights on is they breed German shepherds. That's how they make money. They breed. German shepherds are the largest I've seen is they wrote a book. Yeah, they wrote a book. I have the book. It's a book about raising puppies. Correct. The same guys. Same guys. Oh, so they weren't Buddhist. They were Russian Orthodox and they raise German shepherds. So they live on this property and there are these 11 German shepherds and at the end of the property, the only way off the property where two mobile homes unconnected to the monastery at the end of this road that leads up to the monastery. And both of those homes had German shepherds as well that were a little territorial. So there really was no way for me to escape.

Speaker 1:          05:29          Like I couldn't. I ran 120 miles up and down the driveway while I was there because I couldn't leave the property. So you just timed herself or paced yourself using an APP or something? I said like 2000 steps equals a mile. You counted your steps. Oh, Jesus Christ, dude. Yeah. I counted and I marked it. What did they think about you running back and forth like that? Thought it was a fucking psychopath. I'm like, you guys have been here for 50 years then I'm just trying to get some extra sales. What are the, the guys like that had been there for 50 years? Uh, quiet. No they were, they were extremely listened to date. They were doing what they wanted to do with their life. So they were super happy. Really? Yeah, super present. I mean very present and I mean I live in a world that to do list man and like, you know, they were very present, very happy and really, really nice to me.

Speaker 1:          06:27          And everybody. Did you talk to them? They speak English. What was the conversation like? Like what, what, what do you say to a guy who's been in a monastery for 50 years? Just staring at the walls while I wanted, if I could have talked to him about the pageant, that would have been just a conversation he brought. I know, super confusing. Uh, when I first got up there and they would ask me a little bit about my background. I told them, you know, I was in the private jet business. They didn't understand private jets really. And then I said, I had a coconut water company. They never heard of coconut water. I told them I was involved with the Atlanta Hawks and one of the monk said, Oh, I've been to a an expos game. And I'm like, that's a different sport and they don't play, they don't exist anymore.

Speaker 1:          07:10          And this is very like time warped at first. It was really interesting, really interesting. Jesus. Now what led these, these guys that are 50 years, 50 years on the Montessori, how old were they? Uh, so some of the, the, the age range from, I think the youngest monk was probably 35 up until late seventies. So late seventies with the guys that had been there for 50 years. They checked in when they were 20. Yeah. And the young twenties in the same spot, they actually built this monastery by hand. They bought 500 acres for very, you know, I think it was like $50,000 or something. I mean, something crazy. And then they built the monastery by hand. And so it's been a passion of love and labor and they've been there since. And so the vow of celibacy, the whole deal and celibacy, poverty, poverty and sober 20.

Speaker 1:          08:05          Yeah. They take a vow for things of um, celibacy. Poverty's, they pledge all their personal belongings to the monastery. So really the only possession is a driver's license, obedience and stability. Meaning we're not leaving. This is what we're going to do. So I mean, talking about discipline, just off the charts do forever. Forever. And where do they get funding? They're self sufficient. So they, they breed German shepherds, they sell them. That's kind of one income stream. And then their master's world, masters of dog training training. So every two weeks they have 10 dogs that come in and they, and I've, I watched this, I mean they literally, dogs come in like spuds Mackenzie and leave. Like they just left etiquette school. Like it's, it's, it's, it was like anytime you're in the presence of the people that are the best in the world and what they do, it's fucking fascinating.

Speaker 1:          09:02          And these guys were masters. They are the masters of imagery that there's a lot of people that are great but in their space of dog training and breeding. What was so special about the way they train dogs? Just the command like, like they had an energy that the dogs responded to. I mean like I would walk in and the dogs would go crazy. They'd sniff my nuts. They just, they go nuts. Right. These guys would walk in and like they could just sense that they were in control, they were in control and like the eye contact that they, everything, the way that they talk, their tone, their hand mannerisms. They just have mastered this and they have a deep connection with dogs. Dogs are weird in that way. Like I have a one year old golden retriever and he has different rules for different people and he knows who he can get away with what with like my wife's mom has zero shot at controlling this dog.

Speaker 1:          09:57          Like it's like, he's like, ah, no, no, no. I'm the boss. I think I'm going to jump up on you and kiss. Yeah, yeah, no, no. I'm going to just run around and put a pause on you and you sit in a chair and you know, we're like, Marshall, come on man. What the fuck? What is this? You don't do this? And it doesn't matter when she's here, he just decides Mac new set of rules with this lady. She doesn't seem to know what the fuck to do with me. But when, uh, I had a trainer that I worked with him for in the beginning when I first got him and when Ryan, the trainer comes over, he just like sits down, he's super chill, he listens. He's like, Oh, this guy knows what the fuck to do. Yeah. He knows how to control me.

Speaker 1:          10:35          Right. So it's, it's very interesting. He's even different with me than he is with my friends. Like my friends would come over, it's like, let me try you out, motherfucker, pause on you and see what's up. And I wish you would be like across the board with everybody. But he's just, it's all love. So it's not bad. You know, he's just a lovely dog. Yeah. But just like pause on you and shit. You know, and I'm not really a dog person. I liked dogs, but we have one. No, no, but we don't really connect. You don't connect with the dog. I mean not like instant love when they see me the way that they are with other people, I don't know. But the monks were using that were teaching me various lessons, almost like karate kid style through the dogs. So like the first day I got there, every day I was signed to different role with, I would shadow one of the monks and there were eight and they had different responsibilities around the monastery.

Speaker 1:          11:27          The first day I was in the training center with one of the monks, there was training the dog and my job was to be the distractor. So rainbow, this dog would walk around and I would fucking go Adam and jump and run and like try to, you know, whatever, get them to break his goal of going. They would kind of simulating a park scene or a city scene and making this dog not get distracted. So I would go nuts with the pork chop and this and throw it, whatever. The dog would just go unwavering from point a to point B. And the monk said to me at the end, he's like, it's just like life man. He's like, if you have

Speaker 3:          12:01          goal,

Speaker 1:          12:02          just like rainbows goal is to get from a to B, you can't be distracted and your goal. And I was like, that makes sense. Some karate kid stuff. I was like, Mike Song. Yeah, like wax on and but all these different lessons started to emerge. It was pretty interesting. Wow. So that, that isn't just, it's, it's interesting too that they're doing it with German shepherds are really, really smart dogs. I want like, what's a dumb dog? Uh, what's like a generally thought of downward dog? Let's think.

Speaker 1:          12:37          Trying to think like what would generally be thought of as a dumb dog. There's no like prejudices for dogs, right? Is there, this is like, like one breed or you're like this dumb fucking breed. I don't think of like when you say like a dumb dog, this dumb individual dogs, but I don't ever think of like, oh, that there's some dogs that are like spastic, right? Like Jack Russell terriers are kind of spastic, but that's because they were raised to kill rats and they just like, they have a high kill drive and they're super hyper. But like, I can't think of a dog that's supposed to be stupid, but German shepherds are generally supposed to be smart English bulldogs, but I don't know if that's really true. I think they're just lazy. Man. My dog, Brutus is half English bulldog and half Sheebu. He know he just has bad joints and he's just lazy.

Speaker 1:          13:29          He's just, I don't, he's stupid. He's kind of a Dick. He's a dick to other dogs. But I just think that's because he's in pain a lot. These dogs were super smart. They're so smart, man. Those dogs look at you and they love, they're sizing you up, checking you out, see what the fuck you're up to, make sure you're cool. But there's really this feeling like they know they can kill you, like they're looking at you like I could kill you but I'm just checking you out. I had that feeling that they could kill me too. Yeah. It's a real feeling. Yeah. Yeah, they can. And they be like, I was scared. They were sensing that he's trying to like down downplay my fear. Yeah. My friend who trains them has a dog that's like, he does police work and it's like a serious fucking dog and he'll attack like a thing.

Speaker 1:          14:15          If you're holding like a stick, like on command and he jumps and one of the things he does, he bites the stick and then to pause, go right into your nuts. And I don't think it's on purpose, but damn, it's an effective strategy. Like it's like bite and then nuts stomp all in one maneuver. Right? Yeah. But those dogs are, you know, they're a, they're a dog that's sort of bread and designed for protection work and police work and stuff. Yeah, they are. And they train their dogs for as pets. So they didn't do any kind of, you know, police work or anything like that. So that the 11 German shepherds that were the property was super well behaved. I mean, like ridiculously well behaved. So when they train them or they just training them to make sure that they're obedient, you know, they just listen, wash the house, bark at strangers, that kind of shit.

Speaker 1:          15:02          Yeah. Hand signals, obedient, you know, not jumping, but really that, you know, they know who's in control. So did these guys do that before they started running the monastery or was it something that they decided to do while they had the monastery? No. So they, uh, they fell into it. They didn't go up there that none of them had any experience in dog training. Uh, they, that wasn't the intent. They just said, we got to keep the lights on here. And they had a dog, they had a dog as a pet and fell in love with a dog. And ultimately they, when the dog passed away, they all got killed. Uh, they wanted another dog and they went to a breeder and they got two dogs. And they actually just, they realize that they, you know, once they bred an amazing puppy, I live their first litter, that and train these dogs that there was demand and they just scaled it like any other business, you know, and they learned along the way.

Speaker 1:          15:56          Trial and error, just like any entrepreneur. I mean these guys were like, first of all, they were monks and there they're super spiritual. They're religious, they were Russian Orthodox, they weren't, they're not Buddhist. And, um, but they're amazing entrepreneurs. I mean like they ran this thing super efficiently, but the, but the point would only be to make enough money to keep the lights on. Correct. So as an entrepreneur, it's almost like they're, they're limited in their ambition. I think excess, you know, it's not like they're, if they have excess money and revenue, it's not going to material things, but it's for the life and the extension of them, of the monitors monastery and put it away for taxes or what have you. Yeah. Or they have, you know, they're in the hands of God. They have, they don't have a lot of litters or they don't have a lot of puppies or they have no income.

Speaker 1:          16:45          Right, right. That's fascinating. Now these guys, what do they do for recreation? Uh, they pray, Jesus, they think they read, what do they read and they have like an amazing collection of books, fiction, everything really super well red. So they do have some entertainment in terms of like fiction. Yeah. And you know, periods of it. And that went up there with no expectation. The only, like I'd heard of monks, I watched, I've seen monks in movies and read articles and blogs, but I never, I didn't know much about it, about the culture, certainly about Russian Orthodox and the different factions and this and that. Um, so I went up there, eyes wide open and um, but I, I went up there really just to detach and get away from feeling overloaded and feeling distracted. And Man, I'm a father of four and I have a business and my wife has an entrepreneur, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          17:40          And I just wanted to see like, you know, it's kind of been my journey. I learned best by diving into the unknown just like I did with Dave and it just says I have done in businesses and other things. It's just like I learn best by going into the unknown. So I didn't do a lot of research around them or how they made money or this or that. I just kind of showed up. Wow. That's a, it's a crazy undertaking. But I guess if you knew you only had 15 days, at least you have like some light at the end of the rain. But when that 15th Day came and what did you get in a car and drive away from that place? Yeah. How fucking good did it feel? Did you check your phone? It felt really good on day. What's going on on Twitter?

Speaker 1:          18:22          Like Day four and five I was already kind of making excuses. I was rationalizing in my head that's seven days would be enough. So like in my head I was going home day seven. Oh, well, I mean I was like, no one's going to know the difference or care if I went 15 days or seven days. Or is that like if you're at mile 50 and you're like that's enough. It is. Same kind of thing. Same kind of thing until you wake up the next day and you're like, I dropped out. Right. And you feel like, you know, so, um, anyway, I decided like, you know, I'm going to stick this out. And then when I left it was a, it was a good feeling and the feeling was proud. I felt proud of myself for sticking through it. You know? Isn't that funny? These guys had been there for 50 years.

Speaker 1:          19:01          50 years, man. And you're like, I did two weeks, man. Yeah, it felt good. I bet it's it. It also felt good to go through a bed. Well, it's the 50 years when you're describing that, that seems so insane to me that I can't even relate. But when you're talking about your 15 days, I'm like, man, you poor bastard. Like I feel bad for you. The guy that 50 50 years, he might as well be living in another dimension. Yeah. As far as I'm concerned. Yeah. I mean when in there in his twenties that is just so nothing, no sex, no family, no, no neighborhood. Nope. No fucking hobbies. No drive to work. Nope. Fuck. And you know their, their impression of it is like, we made this decision so it's not, we didn't sacrifice it like we decided this is the life we want to live, but when he made this decision, it was 19 what?

Speaker 1:          19:53          1960 [inaudible] shit. Black and white TVS. Oh my God. That's a crazy decision. That's crazy to, to decide back then like, I, I see what's coming and I've had enough, I've had enough these daily newspapers. It's just too much information. Right, exactly. That's a crazy time to check out. So they don't know what the fuck's going on in the world. Did you quiz them on shit, I didn't really quiz them. I mean they, every Sunday night they have one, there's one TV and one back room and they watch the news. So they get a sense of just like, you know, it's kind of where we are. State of the war. Yeah. If there's a nuclear meltdown. Yeah. One hour. Uh, yeah. They watch about an hour on Sunday night, one night a week. And that's how the tuner, who do they, who did, he was going crazy. I was immediately like, my head went to like, I'm sure we're being attacked right now and I'm stuck at the monastery.

Speaker 1:          20:49          Right. Yeah. I'm sure the airlines are flying and I'm stuck here for another 30 days. Right. No, my mind went to a place where I was thinking just the worst of everything. You know, what news do they trust? Uh, I think they trust it all, but like which channel do they go to? Oh, they would just watch like, you know, uh, the local ABC, see the local whatever is local in the upstate New York. Okay. They weren't Netflix options. Do they have internet? Uh, I had no access to the Internet and I think they have access probably for their job, but I didn't know access. So the dog training Jesus Christ, it was, it was wild. But why is that so romantic to people? Because it is, it's very romantic, right? There's something about this idea of checking out. Just, I had a buddy who did it mean for all I know.

Speaker 1:          21:41          He still does it. I lost touch with them 25 plus years ago, but he was a a taekwondo guy and he started to meditate because he was always very nervous about sparring and very nervous about competition. So excuse me, he was trying to figure out what was going on. So he said, let me just take some meditation classes. It took some meditation classes and really enjoyed it and got really, really into it. And then one day decided to give up all the worldly possessions and all of the trappings of civilization and move into the monastery. And I remember we went up and met him for lunch one day. He'd also become a vegetarian. So w you only ate vegetables and we were all just hanging around and he, he seemed oddly a piece and it was so confusing to me because at the time I was like probably 20 and I was just didn't know what the fuck is going on in the world.

Speaker 1:          22:36          He was maybe 10 years older than me and this guy, he just decided I've had enough. It was weird to me though. He made me nervous. Like, you know, like he made me nervous that like, he was on to something. It may be nervous that he was wiser than me, that it highlighted how fucked up I am. And you know, especially at 20 years, it's so life is so chaotic, right? No idea what the future holds for you. If it's going to be success or failure, if you're going to slip it every fucking banana peel you run across. But he seemed to have it figured out, sitting there and eating vegetables, all common shit. Where's he now? I've no idea. I lost touch with them. I lost touch with them, you know, probably like 30 years ago. But, uh, when I was 20, those guys freaked me out too.

Speaker 1:          23:28          They must have freaked you out just when you did this book. I mean, I freak them out. Really. I was an alien and I came in there high energy, you know, rod rod, like he's the only guys ever done that. Uh, probably probably at this particular place I think for an extended period of time like that. Yeah. Wow. What w w why they let you do it? Well, I had written a book, Pryor, uh, living with a seal and they knew I was coming up there to write a book and uh, I guess they liked the first book. Well, I'm sure it'll be good for the dog business too. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So they read your book, they read my book. Were you allowed to read books while you were there? I was allowed to. I brought, I brought, uh, I'm not like a big reader, so I figured two books would carry me for, for 15 days.

Speaker 1:          24:17          But I read them know I read both in like the first day, like the first two days because so then I was like a check whatever they have. Oh look, Mary Poppins. Yeah, I read the stupid shit. Yeah, I said I'm good. Just thinking. Wow. So was there any point at like day 13 when you're like, I actually kind liked this? Yes. I think around day seven once I realize like you know, I got the excuses out of my head that I'm staying, I'm not, I'm not leaving. I mean this, this is what I'm doing and I settled into it. I got tremendously energized because like at the monastery you don't make any decisions. You eat when they tell you to eat, you eat what they tell you to eat, you go to service when the church bell rings you go, you, you w w one outfit. I showered once. So all of these, all the decisions were taken away from you. But when all the decisions are taken away from you, it frees up so much energy. So as we're getting like super clear, and I was like, I liked this. This is like no one could get to me. I'm not getting bombarded. No one can schedule appointments with me. This isn't so bad. Have you ever done the sensory deprivation tank? [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          25:28          there's the thing about the sensory deprivation. You know what it is, right? The thing that's most interesting about it is that in the absence of input, your brain is freer and you can make decisions better and think about things better because there's no input coming in. You don't think about it. But as we're sitting here just touching this table is input you and not looking at each other across the lights. All this is input. And in that tank there's no input. And in the absence of input, if frees up more resources for your brain. So in a sense, what these monks you're saying or doing, by having everything on a schedule, you don't have to think about anything. And there's nothing coming in. There's no Twitter, Facebook, all that jazz. You're, you have more resources. Correct. And you feel better. That's exactly right. That's exactly right.
