Speaker 1:          00:00          That's my goal, to make them happy all the time. When he died, was it weird not having a person? Oh man, it was so man, it was just emptiness. It was just, and then people who we thought with our friends and that we say we're going to be good too. They started when he died, they had started going in for the kill. You just want to ask me for means. Well it seemed like you and Kevin Rooney had a good combination at the beginning when he died, when when customers, we didn't know what we're going to do. They're thinking about getting rid of Kevin and, and I was thinking I didn't want to be with nobody else. Everybody was comfortable with Kevin and the style and the way we were going to, I didn't want to be an oil, so I said, no, let's just keep Kevin.

Speaker 1:          00:38          Yeah. And Kevin was a great change for me. Very well respected trainer. Yeah. It was a good relationship. Like the way it worked in the beginning it looked like, but then like all things, you know, Kevin used to train me and then fighting our finances and the it. Oh really? Yeah. Wow. Wow. And this was all like w w was he training you? Um, before, before Kostayan as well? Well yeah. How many, how many years before Christ died? Was he like holding myths for you and if the couple, but he knew you well. Did he watch well? Did he watch fights with you as well? Did you or were you watching those fights to fight the, with Liam started training with each other. We started watching fights together because you're star, that was the other thing to your style. The way you would come out was so reminiscent of old fighters and when you come out and no socks on black shoes.

Speaker 1:          01:31          Wow. That would think in my mind. I think it was a lot about gladiator NBA toughing it out. Another thing now look at it now for looking at Philly. Philly kid. Thank you. Tough. I don't think I look at it. Thanks Tom. Where you are tough man. I know what you're saying. I know what you're saying. But you were, when you fought Marvis Fraser on what does the ABC, I remember watching that fight going. Holy Shit. Holy Shit. It was like being locked into a ring with a tornado. That was wild day. Yeah. That was a tough kid. That was your peak. That was when it was peak. Scary. You know, you were coming up and everybody was just terrified. It was just a wild thing to watch man to be a part of it. To be you. Yeah. One of the, I make my mentor happy though.

Speaker 1:          02:16          That was my main goal and fighting. It's a powerful goal. Yeah. Did you ever try to go back and get hypnotized after all that's over to try to maybe calm down that part of your mind? Um, I never did. I had to do the, I think helped me out the total. Yeah, it is definitely that stuff. We helped me out. Did we'd help you out at all? I'm pretty much, yeah. You know what I mean? But it had to do it every day. I had to do it all the time. Right. Do it all the time then yeah, if I went to another country and I didn't have my weed up at insane, they what? No, we I going to be here a couple of days a week. A month, get the hell out of here.
