There is a funny, and I know when you need a tourniquet, it was a little pocket square and a Madonna came in to do the show and uh, the whole building was like electric. It was like Madonna is coming and it really was like energy. Like you could feel energy in the building because Madonna was walking into your color Madonna. So I came in. Yeah. And I was like, I got to go meet her before the show or I'm going to be too freaked out. So I just walked into the dressing room and I'm like, Hi Madonna. I'm, I'm Tom. She's like, nice to see you. She walks up, she goes, this has got to go. And she took the pocket square out and tossed.
