Speaker 1:          00:00          There's that and there's also the, the looming specter of the mass shooter. It's just so fucking common these days. It seems like every three or four months, there's a new instance how many times per cent happened. Perception is a bitch, but the reality is the absolute reality is they have happened. They are horrific and there's more of them here than anywhere else in the world.

Speaker 1:          00:27          That's reality. But here's the hall was another good. So when you say that you're talking about the develop world. Correct, because that's usually the caveat they like to play with it. There's no mass shootings in the undeveloped world is people don't just go into a fucking mall and shoot people up with winches. It's rare. Very rare the people take it happens more than people realize and just doesn't get reported on about it. How many people die in Chicago on the weekend? Over a weekend. It doesn't get reported. That's true. But then we live in America. We through complete access to information that is true, but it's a different kind of violence because it's people that are actively trying to get people that are actively trying to get them. It's gang violence, whereas school shootings are complete. Innocent school shootings are the worst, right? Because it's a child and some fucking psycho decides to make the most noise possible by going into a school and shooting it up. That's the scariest and the worst for most people from owning. When you think about gang violence, you say, well, that's violent. It's terrible that people got shot, but it's people that are trying to shoot each other. All right, so then when I tell you that the remaining homicides in this country right at 30,000 number that I gave you annually, over 80% of that is gang violence.

Speaker 2:          01:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:38          That's crazy to think about leaving. Yeah, I believe you, but it's when you see Sandy Hook, when you see Parkland, when you see any that the shooting in Colorado, Aurora in the movie theater, when you see these mass shootings, these are what terrify people. Yeah. People are not necessarily terrified of the gang violence in Chicago. You know what? I'm going to Chicago in a couple of months and not one fucking person has brought up, hey man, it plays a war zone. Everybody's like, oh, I love Chicago. You're going to get deep dish pizza like nobody gives a fuck. Is that what it is and no, I'm not going to the south side there. See, that's the thing. I just went to Chicago. It was just in Chicago. Paul was here and they were like, well, you locked and loaded. Did you wear a vest? Yes, I'm dead serious. I got all those questions.

Speaker 1:          02:20          What? I said I was going to Chicago. Those are the first things people told me. Now, granted I did go to south side. I did. Yeah, we did. Well, you nervous when you're walking around? I was nervous. I'm not superman, man, so when you're walking around, he's strapped a not in Chicago because it's illegal for me to be. That's what's crazy is that Chicago has really strict gun laws and that they don't work at all. I was driving down the road where there were like six, seven, eight dudes who jumped in front of the car when we drove that because we didn't look like we belonged there. And I'm positive every single one of them had a gun. They jumped in front of the car. Well they didn't like the little lob, their bodies in front of the car. But you know, you look, you see a call this unfamiliar to drive it down the side streets.

Speaker 1:          02:58          So they try to stop you. Uh, they didn't try to stop me, I think just trying to figure out who the hell we were or they were just trying to service. Ah, yeah. Ah, so it's Kinda one of those things, right. But then again, when you're driving around, you're driving down the side street, south side Chicago, but go pros on the car. Yeah. Oh, that's true. Yeah. Right, right. So you kind of have that. Um, so we all agree that the gun violence, especially in terms of mass shootings is one of the biggest problems that we have in terms of like a horrific public image problem. Right? It's, uh, it's, it's something that you see in the, in every I'm, when I'm, when I say public image, I should, what I should, I should re re phrase that. What I mean is like public perception problem.

Speaker 1:          03:39          Like you, you see it and it's just death and violence and children and innocence and we as, as people I think consider the death of innocence to be one of the most egregious in horrific deaths. Absolutely. I think we both agree on. Absolutely. So, so that's 100% across the board. I think with any decent person, these mass shootings are horrific. I think in my opinion the, the, the number one aspect of the argument that's not being discussed is the mental health aspect of it. Are you opposed to more screening of people to get guns? Yes and no. Yes and no. Yeah. Okay. Yes. And that in an ideal world, if we could minority report it and figure it out, who do you mean minority report? I mean just like check to see if they're on metal, mental health medication. But I mean we, we currently have, we'll see it.

Speaker 1:          04:29          Here's the thing. This slippery slope with that too. So what, what constitutes somebody being on mental health medication that's prohibitive, right? What if I, what if I deal with anxiety if I'm on Xanax prescribed cause that prevent me from owning a firearm. It's a good question. In California for the longest time they were trying to make it, if he had a medical marijuana card you could no firearm. I think they were doing that federally. I think that there was a federal thing that if you had a legal medical marijuana card that they were trying to prevent people they were trying to prevent both from, they were trying to try to cripple the medical marijuana industry because they knew that people want it done. Because to be honest, it's, it's intellectually dishonest. If I can, if I can go to the store with a gun on me and buy alcohol, right?

Speaker 1:          05:11          Like, and you know me, I'm the, I don't even smoke. Right, right. But let's just be honest about it. Like alcohol, weed, I mean I think utilizing that as a prohibitive means to own a firearm. I think it's, that is true. But if you were under the influence, some of the Shit I got in this studio. No, no, no. You'd be super paranoid. I didn't under a gun and say I didn't say under the influence. I said if I cause all the, all the marijuana card does is allow you to buy it. No 100% but I'm saying that is an issue. If you're under the influence and you have a gun, right? Yeah. But I'm allowed to. I, but I have you go to my house right now, I have all types of whiskeys at home. Right? Yeah. Baby. But if you're under the influence, right?

Speaker 1:          05:50          Yeah. But yeah, no, I can't, I can't carry a firearm and drunk. Right. You can't, you shouldn't be drunk with a gun. You shouldn't be high as fuck with the gun. Neither one of those are good ideas and nor should you be driving. Right. Nor should you be driving. So should you be on Xanax with a gun? That's a question I don't know the answer to because I've never had Xanax. Exactly. Me Neither. I don't know what it's like, but I do know that there's been people that have killed people when they were on Xanax. And you know, that guy in Vegas does the shooter in Vegas. That guy was on anti anxiety medication. I didn't know that. Um, Chris Cornell was on antiemetic anti anxiety medication when he killed himself. Um, look, it's got a profound effect on some individuals and it's not, it's not uniform the way it affects you.

Speaker 1:          06:34          It might change with different, totally different. It's a different thing. I know, I know tons of people who are on it. Yeah, I do as well. And they respond, like you said, they respond to it differently and I know tons of people on, or it will also drink while they're on it, which you're not supposed to do. Yeah. And that, that's not good either. Yeah. With them with, so screening with the screening component, right. You gotta be careful because what it then does, it's like, it becomes a de facto way of preventing people to own firearms arbitrarily. Right. So it was like, oh, well you have anxiety. Or even even somebody who was maybe dealing with PTSD, right? Not everybody dealing with PTSD as a potential murderous, ravenous hundred percent person who just going to go out and kill people. Um, so with the screening component, that's why I say yes or no.

Speaker 1:          07:18          Right? If you can find a way, if you can find a way to establish a scar, a mental screening, but even then, no, because there's, there's a, there's a due process aspect to it as well, right? So you can't prevent me from owning and you can't prevent me from exercising a right. If I haven't done something to absolve myself from being able to do that legally. Right. Okay. So what if they come to your house and you've got, let's say you've got like a cork board up and you've got all these pictures of schools and fucking arrows pointing to the emergency exits and plans of how to block things off and then pictures of Jodie foster and pictures of serial killers up everywhere and you're on anti anxiety medications and the cops talked to you and your fucking squirrely is hell, you haven't done anything now.

Speaker 1:          08:06          Yeah. [inaudible] then if you can't arrest me, arrest can't. If you can't arrest me for, for, for crime or possibly attempting to cause like, like in Italy, like the legal standard is like taking substantial act to commit a crime even though you don't do it. That's attempted. Right. Did you hear about the kid that got kicked out of school? Um, what was the school? He was an agent. Kid died, his hair blonde, started collecting bullets, got a semiautomatic rifle. His friends started freaking out. They called the cops. Cops came to visit him. He bought another rifle and I believe they deported him. They deported them for reasons not having to do with the firearms. They deported him for reasons that he wasn't actually going to climb anymore on a green card or visa. I believe the way the sheriff's were framing it was they deported him because they wanted this fucking psycho out of the country and they think that they might've prevented a crime.

Speaker 1:          08:53          They probably did, but they still had, they still had to establish a legal basis for deporting him. All they had was that, that he didn't go to class. Yeah, I mean that's something you've done. I've done. Yeah. I mean everybody, but then again, he wasn't a citizen. Right. So, and that was, that was the, that was a requirement for him to continue to be here. But it was really, it was kind of like how I got like Al Capone, you know, like God, I could Capone my tax evasion by way of, you know. Right, right, right. But he really had guns and was acting crazy. And that's why the kids that were friends with them called, and that's why they acted and they just found that loophole. Yeah. So what do you do with someone like that? Other than that, I mean, this guy, we had something.

Speaker 1:          09:33          What if this kid was still going to school? I mean, it, it'd be, it'd be pretty bad. Pretty bad. But, but then again, we still, we still have our laws for a reason, right? We have, we have our inherent rights for a reason. We have to do process for a reason because if we didn't have those right, anyone could just come up and say, man, you know what I saw? I saw calling on the war on Instagram the other day, he posted a picture of a gun, didn't, he was like cursing people out because they're making fun of them. The water he was drinking. And so, you know what? Somebody needs to go check on him and make sure he's okay. And it's my monies to go and take his guns away from him. Right. You've got to, there's got to be due process. I appreciate that.

Speaker 1:          10:10          And I agree with you and, and it's, it's unfortunate in that some people may slip through the cracks, but, but I can't arrest someone for something that they haven't done yet. Right. You just, you just can't. Well, I agree. And so that's where we are right now. So then, so then that, now we're getting to the complexities, the hard, the hard questions, right? What do we do? How do we put something in place to catch the people who do happen to fall between the cracks, right? So then you go, okay, try to keep, oh, sorry. Yeah, I'm moving. I don't know if you seen materials. I'm like hydro, um, the complexities. Yeah. It's, it's a very complex issue, which is why we're not largely not having it and we're having it here because no one wants to have this conversation on the national scene because it's hard and it doesn't make for great sound bite and it doesn't make for good TV. Hmm.
