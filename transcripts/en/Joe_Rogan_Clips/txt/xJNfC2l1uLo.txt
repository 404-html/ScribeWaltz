Speaker 1:          00:00          Right, there should be massive. So social pressure against those kinds of noxious political commitments. But if someone misspeaks or it's an off color joke and they weren't as like, they weren't trying to offend anyone and they're just, you know, they wish they could take it back and like, and, and, and that links up with, I mean, did you say you must've seen the norm macdonald? Yes. I mean that was brutal. Yeah. Right. Like at what he was, you know, he knew he couldn't use the word retard. Right. Because it's like that, that's gonna get them in trouble. And so, I mean, it, it, it's hilarious. In fact, what happened. Okay, so he was, he was on Howard stern show, wasn't he? I think, I think so. Saw a, he was, I could have this wrong, but the gist of this is, is right. I believe he's on the Howard stern show and he was a bounty.

Speaker 1:          00:49          Use the word retard. So, so, okay, we'll walk this back now. Now it's coming back to me. He was defend. He was talking about his friend, the, the ordeal that Louis C K has gone through in this just massive exile experience, right. That there's massive social shunning. Uh, and he said he, he was describing it in a way where it, he then got accused that he was cared more about what Louis CK was going through. Then the women who felt it felt very victimized by Louis C k. And that was not his intention at all apparently. And so when he went to, uh, to clarify this, he was about to say, but you, you'd have to be retarded to think that I cared more about Lucy Kay. His ordeal than the ordeal of these women who had, you know, felt like their careers got derailed. Right. But as the word retard was come a retard, it was coming out of his mouth, he tried to course correct and because he doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about.

Speaker 1:          01:50          He says you'd have to have downs syndrome. Right, right. Which is worse, right. As more specific. And of course, like, and then you've got all these parents with down syndrome who are, who have kids with down syndrome who are just, Oh my God. And so now he's just, he's, then he was, he showed up on the view, right, with this, this, uh, uh, on, on this apology tour. And I mean, that's just amazing video to see him on the view surrounded by these, these four women who know he's not a bad guy. Right? Like they're trying, they're trying to, they're throwing them a lifeline after lifeline and he's so beaten down. Right? Yeah. And he's so walking on eggshells and you got Whoopi Goldberg, you know, trying to just pull him back, you know, from the lions. And, um, it should be, I mean, it should be so straightforward.

Speaker 1:          02:38          Like it does it, is it part of norms, goal to cause pain for parents who have kids with mental disabilities, right? No, I mean like, and like, like you, you can look in, you can look into this guy's eyes for t for 10 seconds and know that this is not the big at, you're worried it. Right. Right. Of course, you know, and um, and yet people just want him destroyed overnight. I don't know if they still do, but it's like the moment like it was, you know, I think it was a, a real concern that has his show would get canceled and be like, this wasn't, well it hasn't been there just for a second season. And one of the things that's maybe that's part of the problem. It is part of the problem. He was, he was devastated. I mean, um, I'm very good friends with Adam Egan.

Speaker 1:          03:25          He's a guy that runs the comedy store, is the talent director at the comedy store and he's been on norm show. He was on norms. He was like norm sidekick on a show. He's a very good friend with norm. And norm really suffered from this in a way that he never suffered from anything in his career in terms of like his own personal feeling. Like he was devastated by it, by the blowback and a reaction. And he wanted to come on my podcast and talk about it. But Netflix is like, get the fuck Netflix had no press. Don't do anything. No press. Okay. So the fact that you can't talk your way out of gas, that's the fucking disease. Well, the problem is not that you can't talk your way out of it. The problem is that they wouldn't even let him attempt to talk your way out of it because they, I think they realized that norms a maniac and norm is a maniac in the best sense of the word was one of my favorite comics and he's hilarious.

Speaker 1:          04:10          Fucking hilarious. But he's also completely crazy in the best way possible. Right. Norman? I randomly in some strange way randomly were seated next to each other on two separate flights. Oh yeah. Just randomly. It's crazy. Like norm again, like this is crazy. And we had a great time just talking the entire flight. And um, we were talking about cigarette smoking or like, yeah, yeah, yeah. I used to smoke. I'm so glad I quit. Fucking terrible for you, you know? Yeah. I mean it's just, but I always wanted a cigarette and then it'd be gambling. I want a cigarette, but I quit. Fuck, fuck cigarettes. Like how long did you quit? And you're like, ah, I've, I haven't had a cigarette in years. I'm like, oh, that's great. We land at LAX. He goes right into a store and buy cigarettes. I go, what are you doing?

Speaker 1:          04:51          He goes, all that, talk a cigarettes. I just want one now. He was lighting it on the way out the door. He couldn't get out the door. He lit it before he did. You know the automatic door he was before it was opening. He was lighting that cigarette. I was like, you crazy. But that's many. Many comedians are incredibly impulsive and this is norm. I mean he just, I mean he's got such a, he's so off kilter. He's got a sort of Garry Shandling and create like you don't know what's going to come out of his mouth extemporaneously. Yes, but okay, we, we have to be, let's put this back into the diversity Olympics. We need some respect for neuro diversity. Yes. Right. There are people who are somewhere on the spectrum toward autism, right? There's people who are there spectrums we don't even know about.

Speaker 1:          05:36          We are, we haven't named for sure and everyone is in some weird spot and people misspeak, right. There has to be a way back to say that's not what I meant. Right. Like, like this is like offending people of this type was not my intention at some level that has to good enough unless, you know, we open your closet and we see that you've got swastika is all you know, everywhere, you know, and um, so I think we have to, we have to hold the line here, you know, and very few people are in a position to be able to do it. I mean, he's, you know, like you know, Netflix, Netflix doesn't feel it can do it. Well, Netflix is just so terrified of continual blowback and they just thought like, if we're going to save this show, the way to save it as to get him to stop talking because he's just going to just take his other foot and take other people's feet and stuffed them in his mouth as well.

Speaker 1:          06:31          I think one thing that might help to illuminate our understanding of how people behave is what you really enjoy talking about and you really definitely changed my way of looking at things. Um, that they're really essentially the concept of free. Will's a very flawed thing and that you have to really take any consideration who a person is right now and what, what has caused them to be this person right now and that a lot of us are operating on this really bizarre momentum of, of our past and our behavior and our genetics and life experiences and all these different variables that really need to be taken into account. This idea that you are autonomous and you are the director of your own life is true to a certain extent, but it's also very complicated, much more complicated than we would like to admit. And when you're talking about something that happened when you were 17 like Brett Kavanaugh or something like that, like, yeah, but Jesus Christ, you know, you're going to hold a 55 man, 55 year old man accountable to something that he did when he was 17 it wasn't a crime and you're not exactly sure what happened.

Speaker 1:          07:33          This is all very strange. This is a very strange stuff.
