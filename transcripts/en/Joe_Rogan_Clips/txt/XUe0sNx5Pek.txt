Speaker 1:          00:00          Awesome. Yeah. I love when someone is like that. Yeah. You know, like your friend that hasn't talked for 22 years. I love shit like that. You don't hear about that? No. Or someone that'll stop being in Van Halen to go fuck with swords or Tom Wally and yeah, it goes, fucks with aliens. Do you to think they're really bringing him to the Pentagon and shit like that? I don't know. Cause he said they'd like, I have no clue. And I had watched a little bit of your podcast where he was like, I, you sent me a text message, you know? But I feel like he's made himself readily available to do that shit. You know? Like, I don't know. It's a, it's, I sit and scratch my head and go. I don't know. I don't know either. I just fucking, he's such a talented, talented dude too, man.

Speaker 1:          00:52          He's like such a good song writer. Yeah. He, well, he certainly is certainly a very talented guy. It's just so interesting that that's his main point of focus. I would think that if aliens were real, Trump would've told us. I really do believe that that guy is, he's such a fucking loose cannon. He became the president. Like maybe they hid it from him or his fucking chaotic is shit is right now. I don't know. Something would slip. You know, I, yeah, I would think that if they told him, if they brought him a dose, there's two things I would want to know who killed JFK. Those are two things I'd want to know if I became the president and our aliens. Real. What do you got motherfucker? What do you got? I go to the top generals. I bet it. Look, I'm going to defer to you guys.

Speaker 1:          01:34          I'm not a military expert. Okay. And I don't want war, but, uh, I want you guys to have support. I got full respect. Tell me about the alien. What do you got? What's his trunk borders, establishment of space for? He did that. That's right. The space for it. But that's because there's, that's actually a military strategy because they're concerned that as technology improves, Russians are going to be in space and we're going to be in space or war, fight off the aliens. Right. Like will Smith Type Shit. Yeah. Look at him. Yeah. Mike pence is behind them going, Jesus is going to say almost.

Speaker 1:          02:10          Yeah. I don't know man. But if I became president and I never will, but if I did, those are the two things that I'd want to know. Who Killed Jfk and where the fucking aliens. Do you think they know? Do you think they know anything more than regular people? Because you've got to feel like they come in every four years. Someone would open their mouth. Somebody knows. Somebody knows. I don't know what MUSC say. He's an alien. Yeah. So he's not going to rat on his friends. Right. If you drive that car, I'll give you the cake. Just take you for a tour or just take it for a spin outta here. I will. That fucking test will make you believe in aliens. It doesn't even make sense. It does not make sense. I feel like I'm driving a computer when I'm in a Tesla things. It's like every car other than that seems stupid.
