Speaker 1:          00:00          I just don't think you're ever going to find anything that's going to recreate the highs of like when you knocked out your main tailor, how the fuck could you recreate that high? You can't, you can't. That combination when you pin them in the corner and put them away and then you walk away and you realize that you won. Oh Holy Shit. And I don't even kicking us all going a hundred miles an hour. You're up on that. I see the pictures all the time. Pull that up. That would be with the hands in the air and

Speaker 2:          00:26          people and you know that, that's just, it was so fast. You know, it took me

Speaker 2:          00:33          a while before I could, I even know I walked out of my house and I had them up, you know, on the side. This was before I moved. I still live with my parents at the time. And I did too. I had a pulpit at the house and I'd be leaving to go to the gym or something and I look over at the boats and um, well, you know what, those are my, but it never really kicked in until like a little while later. Like those are my fucking belts. You know, I did that, that I, I'm the role champion and only I got one, but I got three of them. When you're lying in bed that night.

Speaker 3:          01:04          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05          You probably had to be going, well, what am I in a fucking dream? That's what it felt like it is. What a fight this was. God Damn, this was a fight. This was one of my all time favorite middleweight championship fights for sure. And Jermaine Taylor, man, he was a bad motherfucker.

Speaker 2:          01:20          He wasn't. And again, you know, a lot of people talked about the handful of ice before that and a tough, you know, with smaller guys, but he was a bronze Bellis who beat, you know, Demand Bernard? Huh?

Speaker 1:          01:30          There it is. Doom the combination when you put them away too. Fucking phenomenal man. Phenomenal. This right here when you want. She goes all bore. I just put my hands up. Yup. Fuck man. I mean what that feeling, they try to describe that. Like what is going through your head? Everything. Right.

Speaker 2:          01:50          Possible for him not to get back up. I know it sounds funny when people will say that, but that's the truth. You know, my big thing was if I got somebody hurt, get them out because boxing is dangerous. Right. You know, and anything could happen at, they could get back up, they have a chance that knocking you out or beaten you. So, but when it was over, like what does that feel like? It's, it's hard to explain. It really is. You're just, you're, you're on cloud nine, you just not negative bring you down. You know, you're, you're, uh,

Speaker 1:          02:19          you went from being a pretty dope, I mean, is through the roof to being a world champion to being a huge superstar unboxing.

Speaker 3:          02:26          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:27          And, and it's hard to grasp at once and it takes time. And unfortunately, sometimes you get it when it's too late, you know what I mean? You really grasp it. And it's just one of them things. It's, you know, even, I was talking with a guy last night and he brought up, he was originally from South Korea and he was talking about, he goes there all the time, big business guy and he says, uh, they actually studied my fight down or something on how you could get knocked down. This is more of, you know, in your field of up your alley how you get knocked down a what gets a guy to get back up and recover to recovery. The endurance to pretty much have your brain's rattled but be able to come back that strong Brown's later and knock somebody out. You know? And for me to simpler answer is, you know, of course training hard, you know, making sure I'm in shape. But I guess what he's trying to figure out is like, what's, what's the brainwave pattern? Why? I said, what's the m drive that gets you to do that? What does the endurance of the muscles and you know, that's pretty deep thinking and a little pass. I think there's a lot there.

Speaker 1:          03:35          There's a lot and there's no one, first of all, every combination that you get hit with is different. You know, some, some combinations you're just not going to get up from, and some of them you, you were on the border. Can you get up? Can you not get up how bad you want it? Maybe think about your daughter, maybe you think about your mom and you just kept this burst of adrenaline and you're like, fuck this, I'm getting up. Yup. And the referee gives you the count. He just fight smart and keep your hands up and keep moving. The next thing you know that cardio kicks in and then you're back.
