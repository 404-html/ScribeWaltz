Speaker 1:          00:00          Are you, somebody told me you were doing, are we saying that you're going to do your next one independent, you're going to do it independent?

Speaker 2:          00:05          Um, no, I don't know how I'm going to do it. I'm, I'm exploring all like the options and all of that. I'm, I'm trying, I was trying to figure out a way to, uh, you know, cause there's just a ton of specials out there was just trying to figure out a way. But I mean, you know, when was the last time you filmed? Uh, October, 2016. So, um, um, do, um, do, um, but it's like, am I do, I dunno. I Dunno. I don't, I don't, uh, it's, it's what it is, is the special has changed since you and I started. Yeah. We're a special was special. Now what it is is it's just kind of an, uh, an hour long advertisement letting people know that you're still out there and it's like this just doesn't it, it documents your stuff though. Yeah, it does. But there's just such a sheer amount of

Speaker 2:          00:53          stuff to see, to have like an impact the way, like, I was trying to think maybe the last one that really was just like, whoa. And I would say would be like maybe Dave Chappelle killing them softly. Certainly Chris rock bring the pain where it was just like, you know, I'm not saying there weren't ones that like, like people talked about, but like just that thing where like, do you remember when we were kids it was just like, you know, Friday, Hey man, see you on Monday. And then somehow on Monday everybody saw delirious or everybody saw dice or everybody saw Sam Kinison on, on the, um, the, uh, the danger field thing. And it was just like no one was talking about it. And then just like, there was only so many channels and that thing just caught enough people's eye and you came to school Monday and everyone was just talking about it. Like, um,

Speaker 3:          01:44          okay,

Speaker 2:          01:45          you know, I'm, I'm still getting fucking tweets from people saying, Hey, I finally got around to watching breaking bad, you know what I mean? Or I was talking about the wire one time, they were like, dude, you, you could've said, spoiler alert. It's like that fucking went off the air and like 2006, like how much time do I have to give you to watch it? You know. So, um, I still haven't seen the wire due. My Buddy, he, his uh, his son, the number one thing that he, he, he watches is he on his phone? He's watching one of these guys that gets paid to play video games. He watches this guy on his phone play video games. Everybody does that. Okay. So for common. Yes. So now that's another thing to watch. Forget about online porn and fucking me watching Eric, the car guy and all that. Trying to, trying to like find like where you can like drop the pamphlets of your career basically to be like, hey man, I'm still around. I think, I think

Speaker 1:          02:44          there's definitely more content now than ever before. But for in terms of like the amount of standup that's available, does it never been more great standup available to watch? Yeah, I can think about how many specials there are now. I mean, it's fun. It's fucking crazy. Yeah, really it

Speaker 2:          03:00          is. Um, it's, yeah, so they're not really specials, they're not specialists. They're not special because, because it used to be special, used to be the top comics. Now arguably it was basically the top white male comics. So the fact that they fixed that is a great thing. But now

Speaker 1:          03:18          though, I mean, Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle, Damon Wayans, yes.

Speaker 2:          03:22          There was a lot of laws. There was a lot of white guys. There was a lot of white guys with a lot, a lot of great buckeyes too. And really, yeah,

Speaker 1:          03:28          the real problem was women. There wasn't very many women. Yeah. Women like

Speaker 2:          03:32          three Asians, there's a Paches this other people out there doing standup specials. There's gotta be anyways. But what I'm saying was, but it was the best of the best, where now it's just everybody. It's everybody. Right, right. So like, I remember when, I remember when it was changing while I was doing a club and, uh, the feature act was complaining that he didn't get a half hour special. On one of these networks and I'm thinking like you're a feature act and like what do you, what are you going to do? You're going to do your whole act and you're still a feature and you want to document that. And it's just like, um, they used to give out half hour specials when I started out and it was to like guys who'd been on the road for like 15 years and they will pick up from there headlining hour. Uh, they will take an half of that, like the best bits from an hour and then, you know, and that's somehow through time just became a feature going up and doing his whole act.

Speaker 1:          04:28          Well, Netflix is doing that now. They have the degenerate special. They have a big J did one. Joey Diaz did. Juan Christina Palicki did one. Um,

Speaker 2:          04:36          I'm not saying it's bad, I'm just saying it's changed so because it's, it's even changed since. Um, my last special that I put out my last advertisement that I put out a hour along advertising. Um, so you just try to figure out, cause everything's just fucking changing so fast. You just trying to navigate, like where can I put this in all of this, right. That it's going to blink enough that someone's going to stare at it and maybe like watch the thing. I just noticed your fucking lights with the sky. That's pretty cool. Pretty cool, right? Yes.

Speaker 1:          05:08          What's the company that makes those octo lights shout out to octo lights? Yeah. Um, Gaffigan did an interesting thing. He decided not to put his newest one on Netflix. He puts it on everything. It's on Hulu and Amazon. You can get it on iTunes but not Netflix. He's a smart guy. Well he just took a chance, I guess, you know, just decided to see what happens if you just make it available everywhere instead. Yeah, I'd like to talk to him, see how successful that was.

Speaker 2:          05:37          Yeah. I love, because I'm still working out my straight, I'll talk to you off air about it cause I don't want, cause it fucks with my, I get it ability to make something happen. So I'll, I'll tell you what my idea was. Um, but that got nixed. I've thought about that,

Speaker 1:          05:53          doing it and just put it right on youtube. I've thought about doing that before. He's not paid for it. Just shoving it right on youtube. Just see what happens. Yeah. And Youtube. Yeah, yeah. Just paying for it and just sticking it out there. Because if it is an advertisement was the best way to get it out there. Well, the best way would just be to put it on Youtube. Right. And then to segment it into like little chunks so that people could digest it. And yet people wind up doing that. I don't think Netflix takes them down. I think when you have a bits up that like from specials that, that go up on Netflix, I think Netflix just let them stay up.

Speaker 2:          06:28          Just depends on what your, uh, what your contract is because you can work that in. Um, we did a special with Paul Versey all things calming network. We did a special with him, which was, did phenomenal, like broke all their online streaming, uh, um, records and it was great because he was a guy that they don't really give special tools. Right. Right. Now, you know, who do you do the special for? A comedy central. Oh, and uh, so the streaming version was really successful. Yeah. I mean he, he, he did well on, well now trying to get people to actually just fucking sit down and watch television. Like everybody tape you tape shit. That's just how it works. Which is now if you watch like NFL Games, they have this thing now where the game's going on and all of a sudden the game slides to the left and then this two boxes and the advertising box is bigger because they know that everybody's taping games and they're blowing through it.

Speaker 2:          07:22          And advertisers somehow can tell if someone fast forwarded through and then they, the NFL doesn't make as much money. So now they're, they're running like this. It's weird. I think these two things, he don't really have to look at the commercial. You can just sit there looking at the game, but then they're telling you about fucking whatever at the same time. Yeah, it's weird. That's gross. It's gross. But is it, I mean, that's how, you know, I make money off advertising. It's like my, my thing and what's gross is, is how your, uh, what, you know, if you're dumping shit in the water supply, if you got like all kinds of like, you know, I mean I think they all have some sort of labor fucking issues.

Speaker 1:          07:59          I would like, I would like to be able to pay to not have that. Like if I could Amazon one click, I'm like, well how much am I going to give you for each game? Well a don't have to see that. Yeah, but they'll give you,

Speaker 2:          08:10          they will fit. But what the advertisers would do is their pockets are deeper and they're gonna, they're gonna go, they're gonna find like what's funny is when the Internet started out, all of a sudden you just, you went from watching seeing all these commercials to like nothing to now seeing way more than you ever saw. Like my, the worst is when you watch an hour long youtube video and then all of a sudden it just stops and you know, they try to make, make a nice break and then you just watch this and it annoys me. But I'm like, well, I do advertise on my podcast helps set about this. Can I get, um,

Speaker 1:          08:42          you know, I don't know. When you see, when you look at the line and you see those little yellow lines on the youtube video, we know that's where the fucking ads are going to pop up. Oh No, I didn't know that. Yeah. Isn't that how it works? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I

Speaker 2:          08:56          mean, look, advertising is what it is. I mean, it's either that or you do like a Patriot type deal. We have people contribute. Like Sam Harris does that, right? It doesn't, you don't, there's a million ways to do it, but like I don't get mad at advertising because like I said, a standup specials, me advertising, then I'm going to be out on the road and you say that, but it's not, it's entertainment. It's people that watch it. They can enjoy it. Like no one's thinking about it that way. It's a way also to do advertising entertainment like way back. Those less filling tastes. Great. Bud lite. Miller lite commercials were fucking great. Funny. They were great. And you wanted to see them and you love them. Um, or at least I did a self. Yeah. This ways. There's ways to do everything.
