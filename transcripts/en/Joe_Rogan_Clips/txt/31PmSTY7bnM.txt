Speaker 1:          00:00          So I think this is it. There's a bigger discussion. I think both of you could probably shed some important light on too outside of Twitter. This weaponization of content from platforms is being used to get people banned from their banking accounts. You know, they're getting there. Uh, we can talk about Patrion for instance, and again, I'm not, this is, this may just be something you could chime in on. Patrion band, a man named Carl Benjamin and also known as Sargon of a cod. He's also banned from Twitter. And it was because you know why he got banned from Twitter. Um, I can see

Speaker 2:          00:30          that's an interesting one.

Speaker 1:          00:32          Uh, I do have some, some of the details here. Um, do you want me to read them? Okay. Um, it looks like it's going to be growth. It's not stuff that I love saying. Um, but I will say it should make, he doesn't like cursing either. Um, let's see. I curse more than he does, so I guess I should say it a first strike. Um, fuck white people kill all men die. CISCOM none of the above qualify as hate speech. Was that, uh, I don't have the dates, I'm sorry. But he's, he's a white guy. I mean obviously he's joking around there. Fuck white people. It also sounds like he's trying to make a point about your roles and how you enforce them. Not actually also exactly why you got kicked off patriarch. He was, it was exactly. Well, I know he also posted a photo of interracial gay porn at some white nationalists to make them angry. Yes. Yeah. He's funny. He's funny. I'm dying. I can understand how a posting that photo is that an egregious violation of the rules, whether, whether or not he was trying to insult some people. That's a very good point. And I wanted to bring that up. Is Porn a violation of the rules?

Speaker 2:          01:42          Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:43          porn generally? No. Good. Really good for you. Why would he bends in my feed all the time? I follow a couple of naughty girls and occasionally they post pictures of themselves engaging in intercourse. I'm like, yikes. So then what, what else, what are the other strikes for Saigon or car? Let's see. Um, there was the use of a Jewish slur. Um, how do you use it? A to a person. You trader remainer white genocide supporting Islamic file.

Speaker 2:          02:13          Did you slur lover

Speaker 1:          02:16          that should keep you going Hashtag Hitler was right. But these are general opinions. These are targeted. They're targeted at somebody. That sounds like he's being sick. Like he's making a joke. You're going to say understanding context. It sounds like the other one, like in context what he's saying, particularly the fact that he's a white guy, that doesn't sound like a racial slur at all. I mean he's saying fuck white people and he is white and context. Again, these are tied together. I always knew that person was not to be trusted. That fucking Jewish slur. Oh you saying there's a bunch of very specific person trying to be very precise. A specific Jewish person. I don't know the race of this person. I'm sorry. And this is not okay, but this is it. This is not parody. This is not joking around. We didn't view it that way.

Speaker 1:          03:03          I'm just telling, I'm not trying to like re litigate all this. I'm just telling you what they were. I knew he had done things that were like egregious violations of the rules because you know, plain and simple, I didn't bring him up to, you know, go through and try and figure out a feat, but that it does sound like at least the first one was meant to be a critique of, yeah. So there are a bunch of others. If you want to hear him more than that, keep it rolling. Again, targeted, this is how I know one day that I'll be throwing you from a helicopter. You're the same kind of malignant cancer. Don't forget it. Um, so there's this, it's not one thing or two things or three things. This is like a bunch of them. He could imagine thinking, going to throw someone from a helicopter helicopter.

Speaker 1:          03:40          But admittedly, and I so, so he, he, he, he's on youtube by the name of Sargon of Akkad is a big account and I've criticized him for being overly mean in the past and I think it's exemplified by angry, but, but he, he is a very different now. And I guess the reason I brought them up was not very different now. How so? Well, a lot of the content, he makes as much calmer. He's, he's less likely to insult someone directly. He makes probably recognizing that he's on his last straw. Oh, definitely. Essentially kicked off of Twitter. He's on Youtube. He's probably got a mind his p's and q's. Oh, but so, um, the reason I brought him up again, but we'll move on was that activists found a livestream from eight months ago. I totally forgot why I was bringing it up because we've moved so far away from where we were.

Speaker 1:          04:19          But, um, they, they pulled a clip from an hour and a half or whatever into a two hour live stream on a small channel. They only had 2000 views sent to Patrion and then Patriot said, yep, that's a violation and banned him out. Right. Without warning. Which again, I understand it's different from what you guys do. You do suspensions first. But, uh, I guess the reason I was bringing up was to talk about a few things. Um, why blocking isn't enough, why muting isn't enough. And if you think that it's driving people off the platform, people post my tweets on Reddit, I blocked them, they use a dummy account, load up my tweet, post it to reddit and then spam me on reddit. So you know, blocking and even leaving Twitter would never do anything short of me shutting up. There's nothing you can do to protect me or anyone else.

Speaker 3:          05:00          Look, I mean, these are exactly the conversations we're having are one, the reason why I don't think blocking and reading or enough is one, I don't think we've made mute powerful enough. It's spread all over the service. Uh, you, you can use it and then you got to go find where you actually meet. These people are under their profile page and that's just, uh, it's not a, it's a disaster. It just doesn't work in the same way that it should work. In the same way that follow works, which is just the inverse event,

Speaker 1:          05:28          I noticed that now I get a notification that says, you can't see this tweet because you meet it. This person right before I would just see a weird reply and be like, oh, it's one of those. Exactly. So

Speaker 3:          05:37          there's also all this infrastructure that we have to fix in order to like pass those through in terms of what action you took or what action someone else talked to be transparent about what's happening on the network. The second, um, the second thing that block is really interesting. I think it's, uh, my view is it's wholly an unsatisfying because what you're doing is your blocking someone. They get notification that you've blocked them, uh, which may embolden them even more, which causes, you know, others around and ramifications from, from the network. But also that person can log out of Twitter and then look at your tweets. Uh, just on the public web because we're, we're public so it doesn't feel as as rigorous and as durable. Something like making mute much stronger.

Speaker 1:          06:28          I guess the challenge is no matter what rule you put in place, people are going to harass you if you're a, if you're engaging in public discourse, you know, if I go out in the street and yell out my opinion, somebody could get in my face if I get off Twitter cause I'm sick. I mean look, you know, I'm sure you get a way more than I do, especially as you know, the high profile probably getting it right now. Yeah, totally. Oh me too. God, I can only imagine, but so, so the only thing I can do is, look, we're not on Twitter right now. We're on Joe Rogan's podcast and they're still going to target you on Twitter. They're still going to, I guarantee we're all of a reddit. The the, the leftest probably railing on me, the rights wailing on you guys. So it's, it's, it seems like even if you try everything in your power to make Twitter healthier and better, it's not going to change anything

Speaker 4:          07:09          that I'm not sure about that because one of the things that I do think is that just, I'm not in favor of a lot of this heavy handed banning and a lot of the things that have been going on particular like a case like the Megan Murphy case. But what I think that we are doing is we're, we're exploring the idea of civil discourse where we're trying to figure out what's acceptable and what's not acceptable and you're communicating about this on a very large scale and it's putting that out there and then people are discussing it whether they agree or disagree with a vehemently defend you or, or hate you. They're discussing this and this is, I think this is how these things change and they change over long periods of time. Think about words that were commonplace just a few years ago that you literally can't say anymore. Right. You know, I mean, there's so many of them that were extremely commonplace or not even thought to be offensive 10 years ago, that now you can get banned off

Speaker 1:          08:10          well, soaps for, but that's, that's a good point to argue against banning people and to cease enforcing hate speech rules. I agree with that as well. I think it's both things.
