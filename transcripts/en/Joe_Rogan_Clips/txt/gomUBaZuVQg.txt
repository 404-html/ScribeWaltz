Speaker 1:          00:00          This is going on today in China. World Cup kiss sparks, social media debate on sexual harassment in China. Hello. Why? Uh, so he's a male reporter in these two Russian fans, gave him a kiss while he was recording and it's caused like a reverse sexual harassment debate and transparently it's a big deal. Wow. He looks so, what's a big deal that in China, someone like you're not allowed to show public affection like fan. Is that what the big debate is? Here's the, it came after a bunch of female journalists have been assaulted and so, so they started assaulting the dude the other way around. I'm going to go out on a limb. He's going to be okay. He looks fine. It looks actually better than kissed on the cheek by attractive women. Um, they're not hurting them. They can't rape him. I think he's going to be okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46          Let's watch on boy get mauled by these hot Russian broads. Here it goes. Wow. Kiss. Nope, nothing. Nothing. He's fine. He's laughing. Okay. We're done. He's laughing. We're done. Stop. This. People are fucking crazy. The guys laughing. He thought it was cute. Yeah. Why would anybody make a deal out of that? It's a zero tolerance. That girl literally had a plastic Red Cup in her hand, which is the universal sign for being fucked up in public. Yeah. If you got that Plastic Red Cup in your hand, that chick's probably lit. She kissed that guy. He thought it was cute. They didn't move them around or push them or assault him. It was a friendly gesture on the cheek. That's love. I think. Why are we trying to shut down people enjoying each other? I don't think we are anymore. I think I think things are actually, think things are getting in a lot better place in it.

Speaker 1:          01:40          Just all in the media it seems like they're not. Sometimes you know, we'll take that. That seemed like the not the fact that someone's making a big deal out of that. That's true. You can't look, you can't compare that to a bunch of guys doing that to a girl. It's not the same. It's not devastating. The guy's going to be fine. It is different. Men and women are different. In that case. That is a very clear cut case of no one got hurt there. Did they interrupt his broadcast? Perhaps? Did they ruin what he was trying to say and I don't know what. He might've had a serious message and these caught Russian brides come over and kiss him on the cheek. Maybe they fucked up his little project and what he's trying to accomplish. Yeah, but there's no crime there. That's not a crime.

Speaker 1:          02:22          It's not the same. If there was a bunch of dudes doing that to a pretty girl, some gorilla looking fucking football player in her fucking corn Fed Iowa boys came over and kissed her would be like, Ooh, what are they doing? You remember when they were trying to make it a big deal because Katy Perry kissed some guy on American idol. Yes. Remember this is like two months ago, right? She kissed some boy and never kissed a boy. She gets him. She brought him over and kissed him and there was like, oh, well what if worth Katy Perry who was a man? What if that was a girl? Yeah, she's not stop. She's Katy Perry. And if that guy's really complained, that Carrie Katy Perry, her kids are my, I was still using my cares for someone brought that to me, dude. No one's going to love you. Shut the fuck up.

Speaker 1:          03:05          If you can't appreciate Katy Perry kissing you. Oh, she's pretty too, was pretty. And more people will love that man because Katy Perry kissed him. Idol contestant shuts down Katy Perry. Oh, he shut down the Katy Perry backlash. He kissed her to listen. Nothing wrong with that. Looking at, first of all, homeys gay, right? Is He looking at him? He could be from Idaho, which she got shot him and he fell down. That is not a male movie. That's not, oh, he could be. Okay. It might be that he's avoiding, uh, uh, that kiss until he really did find the woman that made him feel like you want, wanted to be kissed. And maybe she stole that from him. Yeah. See right there. Right here. Imagine if a 33 year old male artists tricked in 19 year old female auditioner do a kid like Katie pair. Well, imagine that's a different thing. You fuck. How about you? Imagine that's a whole different thing. I don't pretend to men and women are the same. You fucking assholes. Imagine a Volkswagen. Fuck your stepmom. You know what I'm saying? Oh, magic. Now think about your dad does. What are we doing? This is stupid. It's just the same thing, man. It's just fucking not the same thing. Everybody's okay. That Chinese guy was laughing, man. Oh, he probably jerked off to the video. The House multiple times.
