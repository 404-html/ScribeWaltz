Speaker 1:          00:01          Yeah, I'll delete. Didn't hear a lot about Neal Brennan special from people that watch three months while he was on there. That's right. He was medians of the world. Yeah. Neil Brent Hill. I want to say anything about his new stuff because I'll give away the premises, but he's murdered. He's super impressed with Neal Brennan. I was like, Whoa, this is the funniest I've ever heard them. I love that. Oh, he's a monster. He's very good. He's definitely the best one I've seen so far on that, on that species. He's very smart, man. He's very smart and his new stuff is excellent. It's an analogy of Isis to talk, don't say, but yeah. Yeah. Good. He pushes up a lot of people. Your favorite comedians. Shit. He Punches Up Ellen's rock. Chris Rock. Dave Chappelle. He was Dave Chappelle's writing part. I get, you know, for the Chapelle show. Come on, was back when we were friends with him.

Speaker 1:          00:50          He hadn't even done standup yet. Remember that when we hung out with them in New York, Eddie came with me when I did, uh, the fear factor, Chappelle sketch. We did a weird ass warehouse. How long ago was this? 2004. It was a long time ago. What's it even, it might've been three. Could have been three. It was, so we fly out to New York and they're filming all day in this fucking old ass warehouse with no windows and it's freezing. Everybody's in winter coats. And we had a like one of those burner here, things those portable like inferno heater things. Eddie and I were fucking huddled by this time. Everybody was the camera man, the grips. And um, he did, um, the crackhead character, Dave Chappelle stayed.

Speaker 1:          01:40          He stayed in character the whole fucking day. And he's trying to tell him about me. Like he introduced me to Dave Chappelle. He goes, this guy, he just tapped toilet Gracie and he was like, hi Gracie. Damn. Still the whole bill all. Yeah. So all, every time we ran into each other throughout the day, he'd look at me and goes, you tap wise, crazy ass over and over. He would say the same shit. I wonder why it took so Neil so long to get into stand up. He's such a brilliant room. I think he sat back and watched it and probably thought he could do it and then said, no on, let me just give it a shot. And he just took to it like a duck to water. Yup. Yeah.
