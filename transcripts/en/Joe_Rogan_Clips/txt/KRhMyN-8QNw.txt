Speaker 1:          00:00          Walt Disney's a nice man, but Bambi was not a good thing for our, our collective psyche around hunting, not just Bambi, but essentially all cartoons involving animals to animals. Where your friends, yes. Even predators, like Yogi was your friend. He was your friend. He wore a tie is a bear attack. Um, and he had a hat on. Yeah, he was at a picnic basket and wanted your picnic. Jamie. Look up, there was a guy, there was a dude, um, recently he was caught poaching and Missouri and the judge said that he had to um, watch Bambi once a month during his entire sentence. Why? It's if you find that that is real, that just needs a reality show. He like, oh, I don't know what to do, honey. I know what to do. We'll make it much Bambi. He poached a deer. This is the guy who like the whole other, it was like a whole family guys.

Speaker 1:          00:44          Here we're in like a poaching ring or something. I read this on the way over here. Um, here it is. Dear poacher sentence to watch Bambi every month during a year in Missouri jail. Yeah. This might be a judge that's like looking for a little steely, killed hundreds of deer sometimes taking over their heads and leaving the rest to Rodan fields. Keep. Ah, how about you keep that guy in jail for more than a year? There he is. Look at him. David Barry Jr. Look at him. Fucking Dork has been ordered to watch one thing, man. If that guy was killing him because he was poor and he was just eating deer and that's how he made his, that's how he got food. That's not the case. He don't care. He chopping the heads off and just took the heads guy. Just fuck. Fuck anybody who does that anyway. Fuck anybody who just wants to shoot something as damn delicious and massive as a deer.

Speaker 1:          01:33          A deer could feed a family for months. Do you understand? Of course it could. You understand that, but I mean people listening or this asshole, do you understand that this asshole who shot this fucking thing a hundred years head off you piece of shit five I'm puncher can look forward to eating deer and you shot it and you, yeah. Anyway, back back like Walt Disney. I think like that kind of treatment of animals has been, it's been something that's hurt honey. And the third one is hunters. I've heard themselves like that guy. Like maybe that's a poacher. Not a nice way worse. That's a poacher. Not a hunter though. But he's a guy who hunting illegally. That's what it poaching is. He's honor. Yeah, but like camping. Camping illegally. He's trespassing. It's not the same. Yeah, but you're camping. You're trespassing in camping. Camping. Right. Maybe he's, I know you don't want them to call him a hunter.

Speaker 1:          02:19          Like you know, like someone who, who goes on stage at a company picnic is not a comedian. Yes. It's the same thing. I get it. Yeah. I mean he's still killing animals. Yeah. He's killing more than me. That's a hundred. Yeah. I'm a hunter and he's killed more than the official budget. That's true. This is a piece of shit he is, but that's just like everything else, man. There's people that are good Uber drivers and there's some that will try to pull you under a bridge and fuck your mouth. This is bad people. That's a good point to bring up. Like is there, is there a time like I always bring up with hunting, it's, it's like, oh, somebody killed a giraffe or somebody, the guy killed a family, baboons and made a and did a photo. I saw that. Do you see that? Not Good.

Speaker 1:          02:59          Not Good. Well that's, that's a fucking primate bro. Yeah. I mean there's nothing good about that with the idea that we're going to go well for you. It's never going to go well for you. Yeah. Did he put it online? No, he didn't put her on line is I guess the, the credit that we would give the guy who put it online, the Idaho Statesman or whatever the Idaho local paper was a picture, I don't know, per from one of the folks, he sent an email, a mass email out to some friends and colleagues and things of like recapping, recapping is hunt in Africa. Like here's all the things I did. And He, I think from my reading when the guy shot the guy and I got a lot of mutual friends with him, so he's a good guy. Like he just screwed up. I made, made a bad choice.

Speaker 1:          03:39          That's a tough sell, I would say so too. But I should put him in a cell and make, he is a monkey movies. I think he knew like if I put this, if I put this, you got to watch, that's going to spin up after this planet of the apes. You gotta watch the Mark Wahlberg Planet of the apes, the reality of baboons. And I have, um, I've studied the work of Robert Sapolsky, who's a guy who's been on the podcast before in it's, it's really pretty amazing stuff. What they found out about baboons that he studied actually because he actually studied a baboons tribe that the Alpha males died off. They were all eating out of a poisoned garbage patch. Uh, there was a garbage patch to that sick food in it. And um, uh, just bad food. And the Alpha males who got to eat first always chased everybody that they wound up dying off.

Speaker 1:          04:29          And for more than one generation, I think it was several generations, they became like really peaceful and calm and they weren't the vicious violent baboons that are the norm. And that it's true. It's really, if you Google it, uh, so Paul Ski Studies, baboons and I and radio lab also had a podcast about it, which is where I first heard about it. And then I read what supple ski wrote about it. But it is unbelievably fascinating. It shows how you can have this insane violent animal culture. And then the, the Kuntz get removed. And when the cons get removed, everybody chills the fuck out. And it's really, really quite fascinating. But I'm baboons for the most part. I mean, maybe he shot the nicest Pelicans ever, but for the most part, they're a bunch of baby and cunts and they'll steal your fucking kid. That little two year old that you love so dearly, that little motherfucker be on a, uh, a porch somewhere.

Speaker 1:          05:23          And if there's baboons around, they'll snatch him and hit his head. That's like when I was in Africa, I hunted Africa one time in my life and the R P H and r guide both said at our church as a professional honor, right? The structure is like there's a professional hunter, which is essentially your guide. And then there's trackers which are usually native folks that that help tracking the game, spot, the animals, things like that. But our, our Ph, he was like, if you see a bad Boone shoot it. It's like we have Eri, we have lots of irrigation here to maintain this ranch and they rip it up and they're, you know, basically terrorists around, you know, coming around at our camp, mess with their fires, messing our food was it, you see one shoot one and that was the instruction that I got and I never, never did.

Speaker 1:          06:04          But you know, given that instruction from somebody like that, like, hey, this is a good thing for our landscape. Go and do it now. That's very far removed from stacking them up, like stack very far and with a big smile on your face holding a bow isn't, it doesn't make any sheen a baby. There's some babies. It's like a whole family. You can't, they don't stay in one place either. You guys came to you and I said, listen Joe, here's my plan. What I'm going to do is go to Africa and hunt and then you know, like I'm going to shoot some baboons. I mean it's a good thing for this. I'd be like, don't tell anybody. Yeah. You'd be like, don't, don't take, certainly don't take a photo of you posing with an entire family of the deceased primate. I had a friend who was in Africa and he got attacked by, by boom, boom bap, boom to steals food.

Speaker 1:          06:49          Yeah. I forgot what the context of it was. It was, uh, quite a few years ago, but he said it was spooky. He said they don't seem like a a monkey and they don't seem like they seem like a dog monkey. Like could you ever see when they open their mouth? Yes. It's like a dog mouth. They're like dog monkey. It's like a dog fucked a monkey. Like if you really like show a baboons, baboons with its mouth open. Never thought of it that way. But I'll give it to you, but they have a long stretched out mouth, like a wolf or something that's not, it's like a werewolf. Yeah. It's not like a regular person. They're real weird man. They, they, they have all these characteristics that are of primates, but then they have this extra weirdness to them as well. Yeah. And this wildness to him too, but it doesn't that come down to like the core of some of these.

Speaker 1:          07:37          Oh my God. I mean, come on, look at that. That's like a werewolf. Yeah. That is a werewolf. That's like part, look at that face, that lion. I can roll back, but look at this. Even the shape of the jaw. It's very dog. Like it's very elongated and dog. Like they're very, it's a very strange animal. Look at that face man. And that is a crazy beast. And my friend said, uh, I forget the story is quite a long time ago, I stole some food and snarled at him and, and snatch something from him. But he said it was very scary. He said, and you know, it wasn't even that big, would be like 60 70 pounds or something like that. And he said, but it's been pending. They'll fuck you up.
