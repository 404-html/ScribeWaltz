Speaker 1:          00:00          I was wishing to have a little more of that floating around in me. It's a bizarre heritage. You know the idea that there was a different type of human that bread with Homo sapiens and that there's like little bits and pieces of it floating around in Peabo. Yeah, and and people discuss them. People discuss. I was having an argument the other day where they see a need and or tall or neanderthal and everyone grows up saying neanderthal. It's one of those things you're supposed to switch once you realize how you're supposed to do it. Right. Neander tall by just can't get comfortable with it. I go back and forth. There's a lot of words that like that where I know you're supposed to do it by can't get comfortable with it because I feel like it makes you sound pretentious. Does it's like rolling your r's and certain Spanish words, but we had this idea that the, we had this idea of the neanderthals as unsuccessful.

Speaker 1:          00:46          Right? Right. It's there. These brutish thugs that died out, but they had a 600,000 year run in Europe alone. 600,000 years longer run than homosapiens of actually existed. Yeah. Yeah. So whatever's, I don't know that we're going to hit, like, I don't know that we're going to match up and have that run. Well, we'll probably have a 23 and me for whatever the fuck is after us and they just look so many back then fuck the human, like, oh, one of those crazy war monger can rapists, thieving humans died out. It turns out they didn't totally die out, overrun with the motions and lies and they, someone somewhat of a superior race infiltrated the humans and banged one of them. Yeah. It's, it's, it's funny to look at that, uh, that understanding of, of those, that understanding of those people, um, an end up to have the site to picture in your mind's eye, even though he can't picture it.

Speaker 1:          01:44          Like what was looked like when they were hooking up someone are, you know, like anatomically kind of behaviorly modern humans were hooking up with neanderthals was that was, how is it perceived by their peers? I bet the people that we think of as people back then, like you know George, the animal Steele is no George animal Steele is a very famous pro wrestler from back in the day. And uh, oh, I thought you're going to say it was a paleontologist or an anthropologist was the wrestler. He's a wrestler, pro wrestler. Very famous guy who could be a fucking case man. Like legitimately could be a cave man. Yeah. See if you, uh, you got a good image of him. Now this is what I think when I think of people now give me a full body one day go, oh, when I think of people, he's hanging on to some homo sapiens, homo sapiens from, you know, 200,000 years ago, I think a George the animal Steele, I think they were something like that.

Speaker 1:          02:46          So the idea of George fucking a neanderthal check, not that far off. I think our ideas like that. Like Dan rather would be out there banging some monkey lady. I just don't think, I don't think that's the case. Like look at George's body. I mean, Jesus fucking Christ. He's got the hairiest shoulders. I've ever seen an a man. So he's still alive. I do not know. I don't believe he is. I hope he's not listening right now. I don't believe he is. Oh, he's a legend. Legend in the world with the pro wrestling. So it's going to take more news to hurt his feelings. I don't give a fuck. He's a legend. But uh, when I was in a kid in high school, oh he's, he's old as far. Yeah. He's a pro. Well those guys, they all, that's a hard way to make a live man.

Speaker 1:          03:30          He died at age 79. He had a good run. Yeah. That's a good run for, for those guys. That's a fucking hard way to make a living. But have we were talked about, uh, the, the idea of neanderthals is like having a cot, a confrontational hunting style. No, I don't like we have, cause when, when, when anthropologists look at the, the skeletal remains of neanderthals, they see this sort of suite of this pattern of injuries on them. And a researcher was looking at the types of fractures that they have on their bones and where the fractures occurred and the breaks and cracks and their skulls. He was looking at all this and wound up working with a doctor who had a lot of exposure to rodeo riders, bull riders, and the doctor was, was observing the way in which that suite of injuries was very familiar to him from rodeo riders, the types of breaks and the location of brakes.

Speaker 1:          04:33          And this guy has this idea that they had a, like a very confrontational hunting style, um, that they were like mixing it up with big animals and an earth thing they found is that when you're looking at skeletal remains from early people, you still see that separation in the saxes, right. That, that, that the males would suffer injuries with a greater prevalence than females. But with the neanderthals it seems like they didn't have the sort of like duplicity of roles. So the females, the females have the same prevalence of, of these types of injuries. And so maybe they didn't have that, the, they didn't share that division of labor where the females as large as the males. Yeah. I don't know the answer to that. So we know that they had stone tools, right? The crude stone tools, but we don't know whether or not they had anything that could launch them.

Speaker 1:          05:28          Like they didn't have did. They would do we know if they had spears, I don't believe that they've found they had addle addles. Right. And I don't know if they were hafting materials, but they were doing, they were doing art. Um, and I think there's a little bit of a debate about whether they're doing representational art, but they were doing art. They were doing, they were probably making jewelry. And he's like, these are all things that as, as we kind of like wake up to what these people really like, and it paints like a more complicated picture. There's even the steering, I don't know if this held any water, how long it was fashionable for, but yeah, it, this really long history of, it was extremely long history of hundreds of thousands of years in neanderthal. You know, occupation in Europe and then it seemed to be that I remember someone putting forth this idea that it seemed to be that there was this flourishing of advancement that was contemporaneous with the arrival of our own ancestors in Europe is though, uh, they were being exposed to or seeing are and seeing jewelry and mimicking this from these new invaders that were coming in.

Speaker 1:          06:37          But I don't know where that idea sits right now. I don't know if it's been dispelled because of other discoveries and everything that has an interesting idea that they would then, it kind of paints this really sad picture, right? That they would be sort of in the autumn, you know, of their existence and here's these adorned people showing up with these amazing tool kits and all of these abilities and kind of struggling to start to catch up. You know, it'd be like the country Bumpkin, you know, go into the big city and, yeah. Well there was also this idea, I think up until very recently that neanderthals were not as violent as humans, uh, as homosapians. But now there was an article that was published just a couple of days ago that new evidence shows that neanderthals like internees Anda tall violence between each other. It was just as bad as homosapians.

Speaker 1:          07:23          Yeah. And, and find that in evidence of cannibalism. Oh yeah. There was a lot of that right. Scraping of inside of the skulls indicative of tools. Oh. Adblocker got busted. They get us every time with the fucking ad blocker. Yeah. Um, what does it say? Humans are just as violent as neanderthals. Are you familiar with the writer John Muallem? No. You'd like his stuff? Yeah. He wrote a really beautiful piece about, he wrote a really beautiful piece about neanderthals not long ago. Okay. I fucked it up. What they're saying is that modern humans were just as prone to violence as neanderthals. I don't have a problem where I think I'm conflating this with something else that I read about Inter, uh, interspecies violence. Nando tall on neanderthal violence. The other thing that's weird about them is they had bigger brains than us. They have bigger brains and they would be like five, seven and weighed 200 pounds.

Speaker 1:          08:19          Just jacked. Just a little gorilla thing, you know, it'd be great to see it. There was a really dumb theory that was being bounced around a few years ago. It was really hilarious about how we wiped out. We, uh, assumed that neanderthals, because you don't have any soft tissue samples, we assume that neanderthals looked similar to humans, but because of the very different shape of their skull this guy had, instead of giving them European looking white skin, turned them into a gorilla, turned them into a giant muscle bound gorilla that preyed on people. And this was like, I believe this guy was an, is actually was a professor and it seemed almost like a goof at first. You remember this, Jamie? We pulled this up a few times, like killer neander tall theory think you call it. But yeah, it was, he had drawn this thing black, like a gorilla with like giant muscles all over the place and these big crazy eyes and that it painting neanderthals as a Predator of humans. And that's why we wiped him out. Yeah. But my limitations as,

Speaker 2:          09:24          uh,

Speaker 1:          09:26          see I was gonna say my limitations as an, as an anthropologist, I'm certainly not an anthropologist that I'll just do dude who's interested in it. But one of my limitations is I'll here theories floated. Okay. And I don't follow them long enough to see which ones have any traction. Right. I'll just read about him and, and I don't, I don't take it as Gospel, but I'll read about it and I'll be like, that's interesting. And it was sort of like shaped my understanding of it, but then I don't keep track of it. Like I try to really follow the story of like the peopling of the Americas. So when it comes to, to the human history of the Western Hemisphere, I sort of follow and like ideas. We'll get floated and I'll track the idea to see where it lands in terms of scholarly consensus. But on other stuff, like with neanderthals, I'm always a sucker for a neanderthal story, but I don't track what ideas that float up or just very quickly denounced as being complete rubbish.

Speaker 1:          10:19          Mm. Yeah. It's a weird one. You know, it's a, it's, it takes time to get, it takes time to follow this stuff. Go and go to that other picture. That's what it is. Them, them and a us. Yeah, but look at soon as some of his images, look at that image that he has on the cover of the book. Like those are the idea that there some way better ones. There's some way better images where they drew of a full body ones. They had a, is it in the article? Was a link to the show website from a different article. Just go, go to that and then go to images because a, there was some really bizarre fucking, yeah, there it is. Upper left hand corner. This is what this guy, yeah. Well that thing he's got going on. That thing is not making art. You don't think so? No. He's making meat, man. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty preposterous. But neanderthals didn't have fangs like that. Now did they know what it is that he's, he morphing in the end it all into a gorillas that was trying to do, oh, that's a how I, okay. Monkey Gorilla neanderthal. But yeah, but like, oh, it's got it snarling with, it's fucking vegetable. Eaton teeth.

Speaker 1:          11:35          Anyway, it's, it's a, and then there's the, do we even know what those Denovo eons to s, how do you say that word? The one from Russia? Yeah. They don't have any idea what they looked like, right? No, I don't feel like someone pinky bones and shit. You know they have that. That one's not that one. I don't know.
