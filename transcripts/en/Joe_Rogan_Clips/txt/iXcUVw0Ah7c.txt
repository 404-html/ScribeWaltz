Speaker 1:          00:00          Are. And I went to Greg's when the tap out guys picked me up and he introduced me and all that, right. But when you're on the tap out, show that a reality show that will mask called Greg and gotten me. That's how I got involved with them, right? I cite motherfuck us. I left. Linda Garcia was fighting Roger Ward two were my best friends, Raj would call it. That was damn right. Motherfucking Mexicans drawn down. I forgot about that fight. Who'd go to fight pass, right? To bring that up. Um, are still wildest dude other men. So do I, man. And so he calls me like, Cup, I need you to come down for a week. Come for one week. Help me get ready for Roger. He took the fight on my three weeks notice something outlandish just like me and Leonard Do, right? So I go down there, I literally never left.

Speaker 1:          00:53          When I went down, first day I walked into the Jacksons and Rashad, Keith, St Pierre, Joe Daddy's Stevenson, uh, I mean the list goes on and on and on. And I was like, wow, this is what a real gym is like, this is what, and they all accepted me. It was like, I was like in the family, right? I call, I owned a house in Denver. I called my grandma. I said, I'm never coming home. I'm staying here, sell the house. Right. And I literally never went home. She would just slowly come down to visit me and bring me truckloads of shit. Right? Literally, I lived in a closet, man. Fuck a third as big as this room. We had a bunk bed, me and Leonard and a, if one person who was standing up, the other person had to be in the bed. That's how small this room was.

Speaker 1:          01:37          Wow. And I lived there for two years above, above Jackson's. And we train every day with him. And like I said, I never left. And uh, Greg asked me, he sat me down after about, I don't know, a couple of weeks of being there. He said, man, I want you to be my 50 fiber. And at that time he had a, there's a list of 55 ers were nuts that he had and I was like, wow, fuck Greg Jackson, who at the time was the man man, right that the gym was flicking a 90% winning great. And he just, he's such a knowledgeable, awesome dude man. And to see where the gym was to where the gym is now is, it's like heartbreaking to me to be honest. And I, and you want to talk about loyalty, which is the biggest thing in this conversation that we're having right now is how they pick someone over me through being loyal.

Speaker 1:          02:23          I stuck by Greg. Even when the gym started going down, when Winkeljohn merged over, all of the big pros left. It turned into like a puppy mill. You know, it wasn't for, for back when Greg had it and it was its own school. You couldn't turn up to a pro class. Like, like some guy couldn't just come here, knock on your door. Like you said, you get Weirdos hero time. Next thing you know he has shin pads on the sparring. There's litter, be at the new gym, bumps come in off the street, I swear to God and we'll fight these and we'll come in and put stuff on a fight. That's a true story. You random bums off the street and uh, that would never happen back in the day. So Greg doesn't run it anymore? No, he has. He's like, so out of the loop Winkeljohn runs the entire thing and that's what, what is Greg doing?

Speaker 1:          03:06          He kind of stepped back for a couple of years, man, like kinda started doing other things and just kinda got burned out I guess, which is why I created the BMF ranch. I needed somewhere to go and something to do. So I created my office, which is winks argument with me right now saying you built your own place, you don't ever come here, blah blah. I said, why don't ever come here because you get the people you let in here is outlandish. Like anybody, you pay $150 you can get on the [inaudible] and spar with Holly Holmes. You know what I mean? That's, that's what it's come to down there. And back in the day it was like private and just us and good pros. Everyone there for the same mission, trying to, trying to get better, you know? But I've talked to some other people that are, I don't want to name sure they've said that when they go down, their new guys will come in and is literally a fight is a fight.

Speaker 1:          03:50          It's a, there's no, there's no, there's no a, B, c class anymore. It's like literally these guys come in, they want to make a name on it. He was sometimes when you're towards the end of a fight camp, you don't need those new guy. You don't need that crazy sparring. Right. You need, you need the guys you trust and not some random guy. I don't know. So it's just, it's Asinine me, man. What they turned that place into that. That still happens in MMA because you're never going to find that in boxing and boxing. All sparring is control, controlled, bringing the sparring partners, you know, who you're working with. So I mean, we talk loyalty again to me with Greg, his name is on that building. It's not. It's wink Jackson Week, right? Jackson fucking wink your names first. Even when it came time to pick a decision and they said, we want to go with Perry.

Speaker 1:          04:41          Why the fuck didn't you stand? Because Greg still with me. He's like, yeah, I'll just come to the ranch and we'll sort this out. And I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about? You tell me I can't come into the Jackson wink gym, but you're going to back door and come to my fucking house and we're going to train to fight me while Perry's there at the gym. You see everything he does and then you're gonna come and you're going to train me. Not to mention you're holding classes there and he's watching me. You might not be training him to beat me, but there's a lot of people there that have trained me for fucking years. So to me that was the point I was saying like, man, can we just not have them there for this camp? I mean, there's a lot of secrets that I, that like inner secrets that I have, like Yo, I'm, I'm fucking scared to death to fight.

Speaker 1:          05:22          Like that's that the say he can, they can tell him like, or they tell them, you know, go get cowboy mad, you know, that's, he doesn't fight well when he's pissed off. So fucking pissed him off, poke out and poke the bear, piss him off, get him out of his element and give him, you know, the shit like this. Right. So, and there's a lot of other things, small dumb things that I do and tendencies they've seen over over the year or 10. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Um, to me that's, it's very intimate. The relationship between a coach and a fighter is, is very, very intense. So for someone to violate that in that way, and you know, I don't think there's anything wrong with guys from a camp deciding to fight each other and you've got to work that out. But for them to tell you that you can [inaudible] I agree with you, right.

Speaker 1:          06:03          Figure it out. Right. Cause you go that way. I W right. These are your times, your hours back to each other, right. Friends. But finding partners, guy who just came in, like I said, I got nothing against Perry. He's looking for, he wants a home. Right? He's looking, he felt like Jackson does. He's great. I like that guy a lot. Stuff that's not him. I mean, what is he going to do? Right. And, and I just said, hey, frank was going to go and train with him wherever I heard stories. He was looking to go to Vegas anyways. I don't, I don't have any idea, man. I was just, I was just like, man, can we just not do it for this fight? And then Winkeljohn caught me on the phone. Didn't you have the fucking balls or the backbone to say it to my fucking face?

Speaker 1:          06:40          And I was right there with them. Call them on the phone. Like, Oh, uh, yeah, we're actually going to go with Perry. You know, he pays money and said again, it comes back to the money. I'm like, so Perry pays him a percentage and you don't. I can see, hey Greg, for my entire career I've ever been there because I don't like Winkeljohn style and I'm like his way. He holds meds. I don't like the way he trains people different about what he does. It's the same thing for rep, for you. For me, for John Sam, they're all the exalted. It's the cookie cutter. Everything's got to the same and it never changes. It's, I don't understand how you could be a coach of the one of the greatest at one time, the greatest Jim's on the planet, you know, and then don't ever evolve. Don't ever change and don't run class.

Speaker 1:          07:25          And it, to me, it's, he just drove that place into the ground, man. Turn, literally turned it into a puppy mill. It's only about making money. And for you guys all, I'm talking about a pug mill. When someone has a dog and they just fucking breed it and sell puppies and breed it and sell the puppies. That's, that's what's happening. That's the infrastructure of this gym. Now let's talk about training there. Let's talk about coaching, right? Greg's supposed to be the, the, the general, right. I'm just a soldier. How come I have to be now a general ANA soldiers? That's the me. That's just fucking up in my, in my career. I can't, I need somebody to tell me what to do. Tell me what not to do. And I had to start my own school at the ranch, bringing my own coaches. But then now I'm making all of the executive decisions when we're training, what we're trained in, what we're doing.

Speaker 1:          08:09          And I'm not, I'm no longer just a soldier. I'm having to fucking run this whole thing. Um, that's not mountain for fighters. So problem for me too. I like, I liked it. I'm a fucking super alpha male and I like to communicate with my coaches and get everything done in the guys that have a fucking standing by me and I love him to death, but I need someone to be like, you know what? You crazy fucking bastard. You go into hard, we're going to do hyper office taper off as pumped. Right? Or let's pick it up. Right? The, the fucking fun fuck off part of your life is taking over into your training. Can we step it up a little bit? Right. I need that. I need, I need fucking direction. I need today we're working on this, not just me going in. There's then ah, let's fucking wrestling today.

Speaker 1:          08:47          Right? So, um, you know what to do, but it's also nice for someone else who knows what to do, who's completely objective is standing on the outside because there's bits, I'm in this so long, there's like, I could literally Joe never spar from now til the Perry fight and probably not even do one Jiu Jitsu role and I would be okay to fight like mentally. Right. But that's probably not a very smart idea, right? Like it's not you at your optimum. Exactly. Um, so it's just, it's fucking Asinine to me and the coaches down there. So not only can somebody just ring the doorbell and show up and train, pay the money. You can pay the $25 a drop in, or you pay the hundred 59 a month, come to any class you want. But if you're a coach, you can just coach the class. It's that.

Speaker 1:          09:32          It's that ass. And I do, I see a new striking coach or new wrestling coach or new Jujitsu guy in there twice a week probably, and they're coaching the class. Our rest main wrestling coach of Jackson wink, the greatest school in the fucking world is a reception to a chiropractic upstairs. He's great as credentials. Whereas he was a junior assistant coach at a call. It don't know the college name, who got fired for selling the kid steroids. That's our wrestling coach. I had one of the greatest schools in the world is a good coach and it was terrible. He's fucking God awful, terrible. He watches videos on Youtube and tries to teach people things that don't even fucking work. It's Asinine, which is another who I had to hire my own coach and bring them in. You know, it's like, it's like, Whoa, wait, what?

Speaker 1:          10:18          And now they don't even drill. They just go live and they want to know why people get hurt every day. It's like you can't just go in and say, okay, and we're wrestling go. So do you think that people just get burnt out on doing things the right way and they just, they just figure, look, I'm just going to do this the way that makes the most money? Well, I think, man, I wish I had, I had the answer for that. I do because I'm not in that position to, I'm not running a gym and that's, I've never done that because I don't want, to me showing up to class every single day would wear me the fuck out. Where's everybody? It's got to. But you should have an infrastructure set in place that takes, especially if you're the greatest at one time, right? If you're winning, percentages are in the eighties and nineties and now they're in the 20s like I don't, I have no clue what our, what our rating record if the gym is, but it's nothing like it used to be.

Speaker 1:          11:06          Right. And it's fucking, it's Asinine to me the way you were doing as it, you have the BMF ranch, right to everything set up. You bring in all your sparring partners and you would be doing all your training out there. And how would Greg interact? He would, he would, he, we do their show up down at Jackson's and spar cause they sell, they're still bodies down there. Right. There's still guys would show up down as the bar. We'd bring all the guys down or Greg would come up, you know, three or four times a week to the ranch and we do as far as your ranch from 50 miles bell. Okay. A good hour, solid hour drive into the vast Nolan's of New Mexico. Mexico. Do you like living out there? I do. I love it. I was fucking love it. So I sold my house. I moved here, I fucking planted roots.

Speaker 1:          11:46          Now I could never ever sell my place. I'm stuck in New Mexico. I'm moving back to Colorado. I'm a buyer. I never saw it because I have, this sounds like a crazy cult leaders of anybody out there listening wants to operate a colt. I have the perfect alchemy. We're going anchor you. I got 40 acres, 40 acres, plenty of rooms, buildings, animals in your vicinity. Um, oh well yeah. This might be where we start. There's, there's about an hour drive you can run into milk and we have, we got antelope, um, everywhere, which is crazy thing about analog. Did you know they don't jump fences, they won't jump fences, right? You can just literally corner him into a, into a, into a meal. Occasionally jump a fence. They've been known to jump a fence occasionally. It was very, very rare. You know, they evolved before the ice age. They evolve to get away from Cheetahs. However, you're so smart. That's what I want to know. I'm not smart. I just remember the dude is fucking insane. There was a, a, a mass extinction of giant land mammals. It's somewhere around 12,000 years ago in North America and before then there was cheetahs. There was actual North American cheetahs. There was a North American lion that's bigger than the African lion. How about that shit. Giant ass fucking line. And that's where these fucking things did you want another chu? I swallowed it last time.

Speaker 1:          13:08          Whenever I meet people for autographs, he's like, Kevin, if you got Rogan to fucking take a chill, not just take it. I swallowed it. I didn't know what I was doing. Like a man. Yeah. All right. Round two. Here we go. To what kind of, it's a wintergreen Copenhagen Chin, right under your lip. You can put under your Chin if you want. You take just a little one too late. I don't want to take a big upper liver.
