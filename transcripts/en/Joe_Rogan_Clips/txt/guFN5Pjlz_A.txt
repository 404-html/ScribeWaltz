Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience.

Speaker 2:          00:03          I'm going to do a podcast which subtitles in Spanish and I'm bringing them up here on Friday. Why? Yeah, please do it for me in Spanish with subtitles. And then I'm going to bring him up here on Friday and we're going to have a three way about Cuba. Well it was like to rest on the whole thing if you don't mind. Well you mind so I'll do mine about subtitles. Justin at Barnyard cool work or more total. Yeah. So no, we will not clash with you dude. The three of us together would be the greatest podcast cause I could interpret it and you would be, would be, uh, it would be a real MMA. You could really talk to him about the hooks and to Russia. That's a fantastic training. Even the Cuban where they shipped them cause they shipped you off when you were young kid.

Speaker 2:          00:49          They did. A lot of people don't know. Yeah, they look at you on that ain't go uh, I looked at him. You don't have a choice. They look at you and they go do us a little, try that on. That's it. Now, and then they'd take her to a certain age and that or the 80 to send you to Nicaragua or Russia and you train. And that's why a lot of Cubans that you docus because they go to rush and learn judo. Wow. So he's going to tell you how they shipped them off and they don't just tell your mom would take him tomorrow.

Speaker 1:          01:21          It's always been interesting to me because the Cubans and the Russians in particular were always thought of as being very technical. Really. The Russians, Russians are super technical. That was what a lot of people attributed George Saint Pierre Success in wrestling, you know, George's didn't wrestle in college or in high school, uh, but he trained with a bunch of Russian nationals and Montreal and apparently phenomenal wrestlers and they have this incredible wrestling program. Like when you see, when you see Norma Madoff, the way he mauls people inside the octagon, like what in the fuck? Like that is like a, a perfect example of that. Like style of super hard, super technical wrestling. They're so good at it. There's so many. You see? You know, see Loma Chanko used to be a wrestler because a video of La Loma Chanko. It looks like he's doing sambo. It looks like he's got a like a g on and it's him and some other cat and he's like 11 years old or something like that.

Speaker 1:          02:15          So his father put him in everything. His father made him. You know Loma Chanko is, yes, yes, yes. One of the best boxers ever. Like literally one of the most technically beautiful to watch boxers it's ever lived. But this guy he used to wrestle too. Like is this is a, I don't think this is, it is. It does him. Okay. Is this him wrestling with somebody? Yeah, this is one now or he can still do this shit. This is like pretty recent. Like he showed some of his wrestling moves but the other one was him when he was a little boy. Like he's really tactical man. He knows how to wrestle. This is legit. Like when you see the way he's moving his body, he's not faking that. He's done that a bunch of times and yeah, this is, this is one when he's a little kid, man, it's crazy.

Speaker 1:          03:00          It says Greco Roman wrestling, but they're wearing a Geeky, so I'm not exactly sure what it is, but he gets his kid and a gets behind him and sends him for a ride. So he was, he's always been an amazing athlete, like an area. I think there's, there's something to that. There's something to, his father had an idea to crazy ideas. His father took him out of boxing and put them in a dance for like several years. Uh, Ukrainian traditional dance style. Apparently they were talking about it on one of those HBO shows for like four years, I think it was the HBO show, but for four years, I think he just danced. You imagine that his father's like, you want to learn how to box, you got to dance and now nobody's got footwork. If you've seen him, Joey, you've seen like his highlight reel. It's insane.

Speaker 1:          03:47          It's insane. It's insane. Jamie, pull up allometry highlight reel because my daughter goes to ballet and 80% of the class is Russia. So I was thinking about it yesterday. I was watching the movements, the last parade movement. I'm like, Jesus Christ. If people did ballet, could you, and I was thinking of the GSP, like, you know me, I'm like, pre probably fucking does ballet and give them that. You would would be good. It's great footwork. This guy is the wizard or footwork. It's crazy because he was like right in front of you, but he's one step ahead of you at every turn. Like he knows what you're going to do, right? While you're doing it, he's moving in a way that you can't move. He's in front of you and then he's not. It's crazy. Like he's the one of the most technical boxers I've ever seen and it just an amazing stylistic achievement.

Speaker 1:          04:39          Like what he can do with his body. His style is totally unique. I mean every, but a lot of guys have done it. A lot of guys that moved in and out, a lot of guys have done it, but he's doing it at such a high level, such a high level that it makes people confused. Guys quit in their corner. They're like, what in the fuck? And I really think a lot of it probably had to do with his father's cross training and particularly with the dance, I mean think about how effortlessly he goes, like steps around guys. I mean he's got some incredible control of his feet, but it makes sense that like you would learn how to move your feet in a specific way that the way you weren't learning how to move your hands in a specific way. Right? Like think about a guy like Floyd Mayweather, right?

Speaker 1:          05:22          His hand combinations with his upper body. There are so precise. It's like that, that, that, that right? But with his legs, is he as precise as he as precise moving with his legs, his, but his hands Rizzy 60% or 70% or 80% lama chanko is probably perfectly proportioned for his style, with his ability to move, but also also his ability to box and hit you. Well, he's got both things going on at the same time with next level angles. So that's what I was saying. Fuck. When you're younger in Cuba, they picked you. It's not like you wake up and go, I want to be a wrestling. No,

Speaker 2:          05:58          they look at you and go, you look like he could go, go, go wrestle. And like what I was hearing back from them in the early seventies, it was like they just took you away from your family. They uh, that was part of your training. You know, your, then they put you in a go. We had no, you know where you train them like their army. Do you, have you talked to Y'all about this? Like no, we've discussed what this thing is. I already have graphics on the podcast. Well, so I figured that I put them up and we'll do a podcast in Spanish with fucking subtitles, like an English film, like a, like a Giulini movie, whatever. One of those movies people think are unique. Okay. I have it because his, his English is too rough for me and I know what he's trying to say and the frustration in his face. So now he did a tape the other day of him in Cuba waiting for Bisbing in Cuba. Cuba, no Romero's back. See if he's fine. But what is the, see if you can find he's, he's nuts. He's nuts. He's nuts. He's fighting Rockhold now, which is a tremendous ride on the 10th all right. That's a crazy fight. That's a crazy, very good fight. Very good fight.
