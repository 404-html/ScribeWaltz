Speaker 1:          00:00          Ha. You know, you have to think about all these things. I mean, I do think since Trump got elected, conspiracy theorist had been demonized and nobody talks about that. There's a little bit, well, I was always going on. It was even before that there were being demonized. But yeah, for sure. Everybody's worried about the other groups, which is fair. I get that there's the people in the cages. No good. I'm not for any of that. People in the cage, they will. The kids in the cages is not good. What do you mean? The family separation. Oh, water. All the cores. Real stuff. But I think that people think that conspiracy theories got Trump elected, so now it's cool to hate conspiracy theorists or people that are like, let's take another look at this. There's so many factors that got Trump elected and it's a perfect storm of people getting, getting fed up with political correctness.

Speaker 1:          00:46          Yeah. Someone coming along that's not a politician. You know, the system is so rigged that after a while you just like Jesus Christ. How many more of these fake puppets were going to put an office? There's, I say this to comics, I'm like, everybody's done a show where everybody goes at and bombs with their material and then one guy gets up and just goes, fuck this and screams and yells and destroys because that's what the room wanted the whole night. They wanted somebody to come up and just realize how fucked everything was and how nobody was having a good time. And that's kind of what Trump was. Trump was the guy that came out and just riffed. Yeah, he went out there with no material. He just went out there and rift and he went and, and I, when I heard, and I'm sure you've seen this speech where he talks about Ben Carson going after his mother with a hammer and trying to stab his friend.

Speaker 1:          01:35          This was one of the funniest things. He was speaking and he was given a stump speech. I don't know where it was. I think it was, wasn't in Iowa, but he was referencing Iowa. And he's talking about Ben Carson's book and that Ben Carson had admitted to going after his mother with a hammer and trying to stab his friend with an, I mean, these are, these are in that and Trump is talking about it. Me and my friend would driving, uh, at in New York City. We were laughing so hard. I said this guys, I said, he's going to win. I said, I'll tell you why he's going to win. I cannot stop watching this. I can't, I am so fixated by the idea that there's a guy like this on the national stage and he sang whatever he wants. There was something intoxicating about that in a lot of the things you were saying were horrible, but he was saying them.

Speaker 1:          02:27          And then on the other side you had Hillary Clinton who was just a scripted oh, careful person. And I'm like, you, it's just boring to me. I'm like, sometimes he entertaining person wins because you can't take your eyes off them. Well, in this case for sure, I mean in the, that it was a perfect, you know, polar opposite between him and her. Yeah. You know, no, no experience versus vast amounts of experience. No real experience in the real world versus vast amount of experiences. Yeah. I mean there was a lot going on between the two of them. It was a, it was, it's, it's a bad way to choose very old runs really is very bad to look at candidates and go, who's the most entertaining? Yeah. Well, it's also a bad idea to have one person, right? It's a bad idea to have this, this same system that was in place back when there was fucking, you know, a thousand people here.

Speaker 1:          03:24          But I think we've really dealt, like, we have one person that seems like we have one figurehead, but we have kind of this permanent political class of people. Yeah. A nexus of powerful institutions where you have career politicians, career diplomats, career military service people that kind of don't leave. So I think that's one of the reasons that we haven't changed the system is because one person can't ever do that much. Even though Trump is wild and crazy and he's done a lot of bad things, I don't think he would be allowed to deviate from many of the policies like that. His predecessors had kind of established, I think that like the American government, and that's why this determine like the deep state, which a lot of people ridicule. It's an undeniably true thing. I mean, our policies are not just one guy gets into office and he goes, here's how it is.

Speaker 1:          04:17          Right? I mean, it's the result of a lot of, you know, private corporations lobbying, forming, all kinds of forming an agenda and a non democratic way. You know, they're not accountable at a lot of these, you know, people that work at the CIA or the FBI or the NSA, a lot of them are appointed. They're not elected. Right. We have no oversight. Um, we have, I think it's 22 intelligence agencies now. It's only that money. I mean, it's something absurd. How many could you name FBI, CIA, NSA? Uh, probably DEA, DEA, and intelligence. I wouldn't say it's an intelligence that they probably have intelligence capabilities. I would imagine FBI, CIA, Nsa, uh, there's one in yet the dia, director of intelligence, the Pentagon. I mean, I don't know if that's an entire agency, but I think it, I mean I think it has the capabilities, but we have all of these different, I don't know if it's 22, but it's a lot and they're all competing with each other competing because they all want money.

Speaker 1:          05:13          They will want budget. They all want, and that's the thing that people talking about the deep state. It's like look at them all. Yeah. Look at these guys. Here they are. Jesus. Here are all the people that are listening. Excited. Yeah. The fucking space troops that we have space through force that's going to be good. And why not? Why not a space for us? We'll eventually, right. Eventually you're going to have to have it. Oh yeah. So why not have it now we have, I don't know what the national geospatial intelligence thing does. They can't be any more relevant. That's based force. Click on that one. National Geospatial Intelligence Agency. Be any less important than the space force. That's who the fuck knows how many people were working on employs sixteen thousand sixteen thousand look at that. Look at their motto. Scroll down a little bit. Scroll down. No earth show the way.

Speaker 1:          05:59          Understand the world what founded in [inaudible] 96 yeah, Clinton probably did. It's probably where he keeps his chicks. I mean this, right, but this is, this is what I mean. Like what the hell are these people doing now? What is it? 16,000 employees with their motto? No, the earth show the way. Understand the world. That sounds like a year, like on a yoga studios, you know? I mean it's absurd, but they get billions of dollars to do whatever. Then put that back up there with the description. Look at it. We're good. It says there, it's a, it's under the United States Department of Defense and Intelligence Agency of the United States intelligence community with the primary mission of collecting, analyzing and distributing geo spatial intelligence in support of national security. Which is why, what does that mean? What the Hell is geospatial intelligence? I mean, this is what I mean. This is insane.

Speaker 1:          06:51          And if any, if you ask a question, if you go, well, what do these guys do? People yell at you and they know you're there. You're a conspiracy theorist and you don't know this. I just want to know what geospatial intelligence is. It's probably something simple and now I'm going to look like an idiot. It says it's intelligence about the human activity on earth derive from the exploitation and analysis of imagery and geospatial information that describes assesses and visually depicts physical features and geographically referenced activities on the Earth. I mean this is, I think that's how we would know like that. North Korea has a box size satellites, satellite imagery I guess. Well, there's probably a satellite agency too. I think we've uncovered a scam. I think we've uncovered a pretend agency that nobody in that there's a guy right now panicked in the tape of spatial 16,000 other employees going, shit, we're going to have to find a real job.

Speaker 1:          07:47          We would study and shipping docs from space. Yeah, we just got out. It just got outbid on rogue and is completely aw shucks mercy. Not really there. That was an actress, 100%. That's an actress. But this is what I mean. If you, if you look into this stuff, it starts to get crazy. The amount of people that are doing things, we have no idea what they're doing. I mean, 10, I just did a private Gig at the Bethesda country club in Maryland. Okay. It's, you know, I'm still doing it. Private gigs. Sadly. He got it. You know, it has got to do what you gotta do. I gotta do what you gotta do. I go to the Bethesda country called Maryland. Um, it's the entire 10 counties around Washington DC are the wealthiest counties in the world. I mean, in our country, they, and it's not because you're selling crab cakes, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          08:34          It's all defense industry, Raytheon, uh, you know, DynCorp things you've never heard of. And they're old and they were, it was a good gig. They were funny. I got up and I was like, what do we, oh, we a carving up Venezuela. They all laughed. We're all clapping. They're in new it, you know, they liked it. They some people get, and I was, like I said, last week I did a fundraiser for human trafficking victims. This week I'm with the traffickers. You guys a lot more fun and they're clapping. They're clicked, they love it. They're leaning in to being, that's good.

Speaker 1:          09:01          They're, you know, they're morally compromise. Well, there also hired a comedian to fuck with them. Yes, that's a good point. I mean, they expected, it's not like I came out of nowhere. Well, you know, I mean, it's like, so that's the thing. It's like Trump bad, but I don't know what the geospatial people are till I don't have to, I don't want to throw my hat in with geospatial intelligence. Yeah. I don't know what that means. I mean, maybe we need it, you know? But listen again to standup comedians talking about what the world needs. Great. It's fucking terrible, right? I mean, I've been, I've been trying to stress this more than ever because of the fact that I have a microphone. Right. And people are listening. Don't fucking pay attention to me. Okay. I am not right. Well, the best thing is, listen, you know, you don't know you might be right, right.

Speaker 1:          09:47          But I'm definitely not an expert. The best thing is if you go on Twitter and a comedian will tweet something really, you know, it's like we're living in fascism and again, like 400,000 likes and then the next tweet, have you ever seen this tickle? And while you guys are here, check out my web series and you'd go, are we, are we living in fat? If we're living in fascism, you too. I have a web series. You can't have a web series. And do I have the time to luxuriate in your web series? Or should I start arming myself to over throw the gun? What should I, what should I look at my phone? I'm like, which way should I go? But that's all they do. They go by, by the way, while you're here, I have a patrion. We're doing a project. I'd like you to throw a few bucks there, but we're living in fascists. I mean, you know.
