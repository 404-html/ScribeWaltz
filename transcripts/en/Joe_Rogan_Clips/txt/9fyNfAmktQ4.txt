Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. We got, you know this, if you ever do those, use those yonder bags. You know those bags are in the mix. You put their cell phone in the back end for has them. Denver uses them for all the shows now. I started using them for all my shows. So you just accompany, comes in and just does it for you. Yeah, you hire them, they come in and then when they put the bag, the phone in the bag, they still hold onto their phone. They can leave the room if they get a phone call, like you have a kid or something like that and someone's watching the kid, you can always get out of the room and make call, but you can't call people when you're in the room. And I was having people calling people and talking on the phone. You could see them talking on the phone while the show's going on and people around them would be getting pissed off.

Speaker 1:          00:43          And uh, someone at Twitter comment on it and he just, everyone's got their phones up and look, I know I've done it too. I'm, I'm totally a hypocrite. When I saw honey honey with Gary Karch perform it, this little tiny room in downtown La was a midnight show on like a Tuesday and I filmed it and I put it on my Instagram. So I know I'm a hypocrite. But that was a rare occasion and it wasn't a comedy show. It's like a comedy show. You have to pay attention to what the fuck's going on. If you, if you're filming it, you're definitely not paying full attention. It's just not, you're going to miss some stuff. It's just not the same thing when you're filming shit. Like everybody is just, and even if you're not, you're checking this and checking texts and boy we got a real addiction problem in this country.

Speaker 1:          01:25          The, these, these are new things is new object. I realized, cause I'm not delusional that the amount of it, I can put most of it to breasts with a pre announcement where I'm at in my career. But again, as you get to different levels, there's different intensity. So I don't, I get it. But, um, the, uh, I, I changed my pre show announcement when I went to see Brian Regan, the person next to me, I, they were texting, I couldn't hear them. Matter of fact, they even had their sh the light down. So you think, well, what could bother me? And it did. And it didn't matter if it was right or wrong. I know what it was. I wanted the person next to him and it'd be loving him as much as I was loving him. And the fact that I saw them on their phone on night even, they weren't making a peep.

Speaker 1:          02:09          It started to bother the fuck out of me. I was getting angry and then I went, oh, that's, I'm going to do the same thing at my show. I go, don't turn your thing all the way down. I go, I know what you think. And you pull it out into your knee. I go, seriously, if you pull your phone out after this announcement, do you look like a Dick? I go and other than that, we're glad you're here and you know what it, you just, you have to pick it. That announcement a little longer, but it works. I'm worried about people. I really are. This is a really new thing. The more I'm thinking about it, the more like looking at your phone constantly is really only 10 years old, right? Like 2008 ish. The not the iPhone came around 2009 right before that. People were a little texty people, some people more texty than others.

Speaker 1:          02:53          They really got into text messages. But once that iPhone came out and once people started doing bunch of stuff and apps and stuff on your phone, it changed the whole game. You know? I don't know with this topic, if I'm like I could be way off or I could be off kilter, but the way I come to my conclusion about like, you know, you know it is, it is a weird thing and even me, I kill acknowledge it. Otherwise, if I don't acknowledge it, then you're never going to tell some of the opposing side if they don't think you get what you see it, but it just seems like in the past now this could be different with no, no snarkiness it. Oh, this could be a different thing every time they think there's one of these things like TV radio to seems like when we get past, oh I think we'll get past it.

Speaker 1:          03:36          You know what I mean? I didn't know think the world was going to explode. I'm worried about certain, I'm not worried about the human race, but I'm worried about the lives of certain people, if that makes sense. Because it's like saying like, are you worried that cracks can destroy the human race? No, I'm not worried that crack is going to destroy it, but I do think it can destroy the lives of some people and I feel the same way about this. Right? Like the texting, like it's not just that it's, it's like being plugged into electronic to the point where that's where you're getting most of your stimuli from. You're getting artificial stimuli. My concerns is a real concern is that we're, we're getting really into that and then we're going to let it take the next step, which is some sort of an implant.

Speaker 1:          04:19          I feel like this is why we're in a movie and we're going to move you about a person that becomes a machine and we're watching this rationalization process. As we slowly get more and more ingrained and inner connected with technology, we'll definitely in our lifetime have somebody 100%. I try like what you were just addressing. Like we said before, like I, I catch myself and I really try. Like if I had to give myself a grade on how much I've improved and like turning the phone off, like loving it for what's great about it, I give myself maybe a c minus, but it means I've made some strides and like turning it off. You're not enough. Not enough for a matter of fact. Uh, I remember a week ago I was going to the grove and I went, I'm not meeting anybody. Um, and I left my phone in the car. It was strong. Move strong. No, it sucked because I had two ideas. I had two ideas and I was high and I didn't want to write them down. I went ass. Shit. That's the thing about leaving your phone in the car. I take a picture or show someone a picture or it doesn't have to always be, but anyway, I try to go and, you know, never, never walking through, never walking through a line that actually could encourage you to write. Um, you know, you could just use hate writing.

Speaker 2:          05:34          Okay.
