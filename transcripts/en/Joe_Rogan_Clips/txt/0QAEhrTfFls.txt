Speaker 1:          00:00          And I could link it by the way to marketing. So, uh, the dove that Eh, and so on. If I have wrinkly skin, I'd like to believe that there is no such thing as an universal beauty standards. And in that sense dove has been incredibly successful because by peddling false hope, they've actually been able to tap into women's insecurities and incense. That's good marketing. Right? Did you see the cover of Cosmopolitan magazine that was widely criticized because they had a morbidly obese woman on who was, uh, you a bikini plus size model? Yeah, yeah. And they were challenging beauty norms. Like this is a person that's eating themselves to death. You fucking assholes. And so your lack of discipline and your desire to shame people who exercise and is what you're doing right, to make them feel bad because you feel bad that you can't put the fucking cook cookies and cupcakes down as a lead you to try to push this ridiculous standard.

Speaker 1:          01:02          And me and one of the things, my point of view was, could you imagine if the cover of men's health had an enormous fat guy with his gut hanging over his belt and people were saying the new standards of attractiveness for men have been changed by Mike who just drinks beer and eat cake. You'd be like, get the fuck Outta here. That's never going to fly. It's not going to fly with men, but it does fly with women and by the way they go ahead. The Fat Acceptance Movement doesn't just argue that you know, not being 500 pounds is unattractive because of the patriarchy. They actually argue that the medical evidence suggesting that there is a link between obesity and downstream bad effects is all bullshit. They not done, not just that they there. They also point to one incredibly flawed study that has been widely disproven that says that there's some sort of vigor or vitality involved in being overweight because they get sick less.

Speaker 1:          01:56          There's no, no truth to that whatsoever. They only, they only analyze people who were healthy at the time. Like it's, it's there's, you can go and Google the study and find out the, this criticism of that study, but it's a hundred percent horseshit folks being fat's not good for you. It's really bad for you when you're as big as that woman on the cover of Cosmopolitan magazine. She's literally morbidly obese. She's fucking dying. She's addicted to food in a horrible way. And to promote that and pretend that somehow or another, this is okay, and we're gonna, we're going to show new standards of beauty. You Go, you giant gelatinous bag of meat and tissue. No, that's a dying person who's addicted to food. She doesn't want to look like that.
