Speaker 1:          00:00          I wish that with Trump. Sam Harris has been on a, he was at least, I think he's abandoned it, but he was, it was on a quest to get jack to try to hold up his terms of service agreement and, and kick Trump off of Twitter. He's like glued, he's doing, he's threatening nuclear war. Like, do you understand that this is the craziest use of Twitter ever? And I think Jack's position was that it is, it's more beneficial to have him on and it's really, we are getting to see his personality in a way we've never seen any president's personal. Absolutely. I mean the most ridiculous petty shit that he does like attacking Michelle Wolf of because of her White House correspondence, calling people losers, you know, making fun of, uh, the girl on Joe Scarborough, the girl he married. Yeah, yeah. Saying that she had fucked up plastic surgery.

Speaker 1:          00:50          Bleeding makes shit up. I mean, do you think she really, really thinks she showed up at maralago bleeding fucking plastic surgeries cause he's a fucking maniac. But he really is a meanwhile that it, it, it's good for us to see because it educates us to who he is as a real person. There's a lot of who you are just gets exposed in those tweets we little bit, you can't know everything about a person from their Twitter, but you can get, you can parse out little chunks where you get a good taste. And for him it's very, very revealing. Yeah, it is a weird thing. This is what I think this will be looked back on as a very pivotal moment in American history and in politics where that kind of crossroad happened because we were, we were pretty satisfied with, uh, that political speech thing that, and we need to bring up the lower middle class to the door and they just go on and on and drone on.

Speaker 1:          01:51          It's this weird speech that no real human being ever speaks. Like Hillary was hilarious. And Wayne, Hey ted. Hey, it's the guy was fake. It comes off as fake and phony. Trump comes rolling in. It's absolutely batshit insane. Like the stuffy says, like you were saying the other day, he's, he's giving a speech and he said that when he was younger, people said he looked like Elvis because he was doing some kind of a commemorative thing for Elvis. Um, uh, down in, um, it was it Tennessee or somewhere and he says, uh, he looked like Elvis and we're laughing our asses off me and Keith, because no one ever told him he looked like Elvis. No one ever told him that. And, and there's so many things and I'm a Trump guy. I voted for the guy because I wanted that monkey wrench thrown into the machine.

Speaker 1:          02:42          I felt we had gotten screwed too many decades and it was time to let Washington know, like, look, we'd rather elect this nut than any of you guys. So I think it proved a point. Uh, there are enough checks and balances in place. You know, the likes of any one president really isn't going to do that much damage. I think he's pulled the cover off a lot of stuff. I think people are trying to compete with him on Twitter. Politicians are trying to play his game and it's kind of fun to watch. As a comic entertainer, it's gold to see what Tulsi Gavin said to him, what? She's a congresswoman from Hawaii. She said, uh, being Saudi Arabia's bitch isn't making America first like that's a congresswoman. Say they're all kind of taking that. They never used to do that. No they didn't. And it's odd that a 70 year old guy was the one that was like bringing Twitter to social media into this a forum it is on and yeah, you would think it would be some young guy get in there and do it, but I would never do it the way he's doing it.

Speaker 1:          03:48          No, that's just like a reckless maniac. It's and, and that's because he can, the guy, you'll never see a chain of events like what happened to elect Donald Trump. The rich guy is a billionaire and billion of whatever you want to call him. He's got a lot of money from his dad, from his, his dad. And then, you know, I remember him in New York when I was a kid. Trump was always in the news developer. He was always banging heads with politicians, trying to get some kind of zoning thing going or build some other tower somewhere. And, uh, so we were all familiar with them and we knew he was like this piece of shit guy. You know, like everyone was surprised, like, Oh God, he grabbed by the pussy. He's like, we saw in the Daily News in New York Post every week. Trump was with some other hula and said, so it wasn't a surprise to, to us.

Speaker 1:          04:42          Uh, but he got out there and it was the perfect timing. Like we come off the, uh, the heels of eight years of a Democratic president, uh, and it just was, people were ready for a maniac to be in the White House. People were, some people were exact. My favorite image of the election was that lady with the sock hat on their knees with the glasses, screaming like that to me, ushered in this era of outrage and chaos. Yeah. Yeah. It just, that was like the primal scream that set off the dominoes and they're all in motion right now. It wasn't supposed to happen. It wasn't supposed to happen. Hillary was supposed to be president. That's what everybody thought it was going to go down in. History is just one of those wacky elections and then business as usual. But uh, you know, when, when Trump won, it turned everything upside down and rip the cover off of I think, not only politics in Washington, but uh, Hollywood, uh, uh, the mainstream media, the news media, everything had the covers ripped off and everyone's now got a peek inside and realize how fucked up everything is.

Speaker 1:          05:57          You know, you used to assume Washington, at least the people had some kind of control like they were, they were adults doing the job that needed to be, and then you realize, oh my God, everyone's just a piece of shit. Do you remember, here's a story that disappeared from years ago. Do you remember the Washington Madam that suicide herself? Oh yeah. Book filled with politicians that we're getting there. We're banging all these prostitutes and she was going to release everything and she was doing press conferences and then she committed suicide, committed suicide. But it's like welp case closed, you know, no big deal. Oh, well lost her books. Yeah. Yeah. Never would. Whatever. And then it disappeared. Yeah. It disappeared. Thinks like that happen. Oh, flag. Do politicians kill people? Oh yeah. Uh, there's, there's secret backroom deals that happen and it's crazy. House of cards is way closer to reality than people would like to believe.

Speaker 1:          06:46          Yeah. Yeah. Way Closer. We, uh, over the course of the decades upon decades, uh, every year that goes by, we seem to get a little more knowledge and a little less confident in the government. I mean, I watched some shit from the fifties you know, there's plenty of things on youtube and even even industrial films, just this thing of how a family, how to raise your family [inaudible] they had to be a good wife, all that stuff. And it was all this weird propaganda of what America was. And then as years go by, you realize, oh, it was all bullshit. Like politicians were always getting rich and no one seems to know how we're, why and these deals that are made aren't always in our best interest. They're not civil servants there to represent and help you. And, and as the years go by, we see more and more of this.

Speaker 1:          07:39          And the past two years with Trump has just been a man quite a crash course. It really has. Yeah. It's crazy. Um, I'm fascinated to see where it goes. Um, I'm fascinated to see if he seems, you know, I mean they always called Gotti, the Teflon Don, but it seems like Trump is the Teflon Donald. Yeah. He seems, it seems like all these things keep happening and, and even because like I remember Justin Martin Dale, a comedian friend of mine is hilarious. He goes, uh, he was talking about stormy Daniels. He was like, she's our Monica Lewinsky. She's going to take them down. Oh my God, the fuck that's not happening. No, you don't get it. He doesn't care that they know he fucked her. Yeah. He doesn't care to understand. It's not you have to care for it to work. Right. And that's just it. People don't really care. It's a, well some people don't care.

Speaker 1:          08:32          I, I follow like Rosario Donald's account on Twitter and Rob Reiner is another one and for two years, over two years, uh, they have just been like counting down and the day that it's like, oh impeachments right around the corner. Oh he's out. Oh they're going to put him in prison. I hope you and your son get a cell to each other. And it's like, how long are you going to do this? Eight years. Is it going to be eight years of you going well any day now. How about Keith Miller is going to, yeah. Do you remember when he was doing that wacky show in a basement somewhere? Gq like a mental patient like legitimately wick a mental patient resistance screaming and he was like, he was doing like, it was almost like burlesque or something. I know what I'm saying. Like you know how it was like the, the radio version of burlesque ask is like when you see a girl doing burlesque, it's like an a throwback to an old timey way of doing things.

Speaker 1:          09:31          Like the guy of the handlebar mustache with a bowler capital introducer. She's body, she is bought day shares, please welcome Madam Blah Blah Blah. And she comes out to music that nobody listens to any more and she's dancing around. It's very we and they're there. They're always kind of big girls. They're not skinny and like little strippers, there are girls who eat. So it's like it's a throwback to a different time of of rowdiness. And when he was in front of that screen, like doing this thing with his suit on and his tie and everything was like really well written and rice precise points and I don't understand like what the red blue and the background was either. It's just, it was so it seemed like something that someone had set up like not as good as your compound. The basement live from the compound. It wasn't, it wasn't as good as that.

Speaker 1:          10:22          It's like that's the background. This is for Gq. Gq was like, okay, we have $30 $80 I think a, I think a, Charlie's got a camera, he could bring it in $30 good. Okay. We have a table, the Ikea table that's $12 $18 left. We got some construction paper for the background. What the fuck is this? I got some big ass blue and blue and red pate. Yeah, posters. What? What is that? And then he would just pontificate there and, and he Glen and his last thing was like, because the end is eminent, there's no, no reason for me to go on right up is finished. Yeah. What is this? My work here is done play. Some of this. Trump is finished 17 year. One year ago. This week. Exactly. One year ago. Wow. Remember 11 2017 it was when he quit.

Speaker 2:          11:15          Get a pardon from Trump or that molar as I have also reported here, has succeeded in finding a way around trumps. Pardon power and either of these near certainties spelled Trump's doom. So that's the most obvious of the seven ways for Trump to go. Now we're really, we'll get him on Russia. It will be ugly and it will tear this country nearly apart, but it will be necessary. The second way is as I've also repeatedly suggested here, that Muller doesn't really need to prove anything about Trump and Russian sabotage of the electric. There seems to be so much obstruction of justice or the of James Comey

Speaker 1:          11:54          to the lies about Trump jr's meetings with the Russians, that it's hard to pick out a key player in the Trump inner circle who could not be guilty of it. It's so funny. [inaudible] year ago and it's like, it's still going. Still going. Still going and it's fake news. Yeah, end it now. Fake News. It's a hoax, but it is interesting like Mueller to me, it's fascinating because he seems like a ruthless motherfucker. Takes his time. He's like a guy says, hey, look at me. I'm going to kill you. It's not going to be today. Okay, that's all you need to know. It's not going to be today, but I'm going to fucking kill you. And like every day he's plotting on killing you. You see him drive by your house and wait, and you're like, when is, when is the hammer fall? And you look out your window of your office.

Speaker 1:          12:42          He's out drinking coffee. Oh, he has seen some shit. Oh, I mean, this guy, he's, yeah, I mean, he's a cold blooded intelligence agent. Yeah. Those guys have seen everything. He knows the inner workings of the machine and he knows how you bring a guy like that down and how you fuck it up and he's doing everything. That leads me to believe that he's not fucking it up. This is a slow play. And if there is, if there is anything to the Russian thing, I, you would think something would have leaked out by now. Well, it has. I mean it was a, there was a video the other day of Donald that they just played on CNN of Donald talking about how many times he's actually been the rush Donald Jr and you know, he had said that he hadn't been, and then there's another video of him from years ago saying, yeah, I've been there many times.

Speaker 1:          13:30          Dan, five, six, seven, eight talking about business. The problem with, uh, the people that are going after Trump that they don't seem to understand. The Guy Right up until he became president of the United States was just a private citizen businessman. So he had a lot of dealings around the world with his real estate and buildings and, and a golf course is all this shit happened when he was just a citizen doing business. Now, whether it was ethical or not, um, that that could definitely be brought into question, whether it's legal or not. Uh, I'm sure that's what they're looking into also. But he wasn't, he wasn't beholden to the people as a public servant. There wasn't a conflict of interest because he was a lifelong politician and using the power of his office to make deals. So, and that also goes hand in hand with him just fucking around.

Speaker 1:          14:28          Like, like if he went from a, a selectman in his hometown and then years and years go by and then you're the president and you built that career up any at any point in there they could call you out on being a horrible human being because he fucked girls. Or your this or your dad of shady business dealings, but were up until two years ago, he was just Donald fucking Trump. So it's hard to call them out on even dealing with Russia because there's plenty of businessmen and deal with Russia and China. I think the question is whether or not he colluded with Russia to get information about Hillary and also to, to, to put out all that propaganda against Hillary and also saying that they're going to make a deal to do the Trump tower in Moscow. This was all while he was running for president, not being honest about it.

Speaker 1:          15:15          I think that's, that's where it gets again. I don't know, almost there's anything illegal there. I don't know if there's anything, uh, that, that he did that is illegal because I believe when you're campaigning, say whatever the fuck you want to anybody, I don't think you're really running, I mean you're, you're, you're running, but you're not really running anything. And it really running the country. If he lost the presidency, he would still have to have some ducks in a row to continue his business. So, you know, and his son took over that part of, of what he was doing so he could campaign. So whether Donny Jr went over to Russia or not, I don't really see. You might think it's unethical and you might go, well, did he say, if we win, we'll do this and help you out. So who knows about that part of it, but I don't see in and of itself him going over there being that big a problem.
