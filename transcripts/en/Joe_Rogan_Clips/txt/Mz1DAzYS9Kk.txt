Speaker 1:          00:00          Just not too misleading. There's a mathematical theorem called the hairy dog theorem. Hairy dog theory. Yes. I mean, that's just a jocular terminology, right? But you think of something which is topologically a sphere, that means you see it, you imagine a dog shape, but you could sort of move it around with a piece of plasticine until it looked like a sphere. It doesn't have holes in it. Okay. Forget about his digestive system. You see, you're thinking about the surface outside and then you're out. The problem is you try to comb the hair on the dog all the way around and the theorem says there's got to be somewhere with the hair doesn't lie flat and you tried it on a sphere. There's gotta be a point where with the hair makes a kind of singular point. So it's a bit like that. You have no idea where the singularity is, but you know, from general, top logical reasons that there's got to be one somewhere. And that was the tour of argument that I produced. And uh, I guess a lot of people, it'd be trouble because they never seen this kind of argument. And a lot of people picked up on it and particular Stephen Hawking and uh, it became for a while, uh, many people working on it, I guess it's not so popular now because probably will run out of theorems.

Speaker 1:          01:19          The idea of a singularity is when you see something like a, a Quasar or the, the center of a galaxy. Um, and we were talking a lot of black hole. When you say a singularity, what, what exactly are you, do you mean by that? Well, the normal expectation is that you have a place like in the middle of the up and Amazon, that dust cloud, that a point there where the density becomes infinite. And so the curvature of space time becomes infinite. So you have a place where the equations and run away and they go to infinity and you say, well, something's gone wrong. But maybe initially it was in these very symmetrical cases, but what you could show by these indirect arguments that somewhere somebody has got to go wrong. You can't continue the equations of Einstein and they got stuck to the place where they go in from it.

Speaker 1:          02:17          Or what in detail happens. The theorems don't tell you. They just say that something goes wrong and that's what we call the singularity and if a black hole is larger or smaller, the singularity remains constant. It remains in in there. It's remains in there, but it's not measurable in terms of its actual size or whether you can measure size very well cause it's size. I said that's an intriguing question. You might say the size is going to zero. It could be quite complicated in irregular, not like the original Avenova slide or one of my soldiers. Even then the point is the wrong point of view, but let's not go into that. Now if there is something about the structure of these things, you can say they're not all the same. No. Then the singularity is in Arlington, but the black holes are not all the same.

Speaker 1:          03:04          They're not all the same, but the this, one of the strange things about black holes is that if you let them settle down, they're not all the same to begin with, but there are not many different things they can settled into. They can have rotation. They can have a certain mass and the mass translates into the size of the diameter of the hole. And you've also got a rotation so they can rotate these sweatshirt found the non wrote anyone's and it was Roy occur in Australia and who first produced a solution for a rotating black hole rotating. Yes, a rotating one. But then you see the remarkable thing is that's what they settled down too. So there are good theorem this which tell you that the general black hole to very complicated, fairly rapidly will settle down and become one of these care solutions. The rotating black hole.

Speaker 1:          03:55          I remember when I first saw that documentary and I saw the, when they were discussing the, the shape of these galaxies and that the center of it had this super massive black hole that was slowly devouring the galaxy. It's, it is an unbelievably beautiful yet simultaneously terrifying idea is that there's this infinite power in the center of infinite mass that's absorbing slowly but surely everything around it. But it's not an infinite mass. The mass is quite well defined and there's not an infinite, but yeah, always a good question. I mean if you wait forever, how much of the mass actually gets swallowed by the black hole? You see, I think the, the pictures to think not just the one galaxy, but the cluster. UCR Galaxy has this 4 million solar mass black hole and we are on a collision course with the Andromeda galaxy and I don't know how long, but many book some time in the future.

Speaker 1:          04:54          Yes. The black holes, we'll probably spiral into each other and there'll be one big one. So it's definable mass, but in infinite density and that this point, which were, they were speculating that this could possibly in the center of the supermassive black holes, if you could go through that, there would be another universe. Well, speculations, a nice romantic thought. It's more woo woo, I'm afraid. So also good though. Yes, I know it's a shame for science fiction because it makes a nice thing that we try to make things more complicated than they are because they're so complicated as it is dark matter for instance, it, it boggles the mind that we don't really totally understand what 90 plus percent. Well, that's a good question. And what does that stuff, well, do you want me to tell you my theory? Yes, please. Why do you see it's part of a story which, um, I don't know about 15 years ago, I must have years of passing back.

Speaker 1:          05:54          I don't remember how long ago now. So I had this idea, you see, the universe as a whole is expanding now, um, early in the this century. Don't ask me dates again. Um, some people by observing supernova saw exposing sauce very, very far away. They found out that the university is actually accelerating and it's expansion. And some people found this very mysterious. On the other hand, it's in all the cosmology books because there is that expectation. You see, in 1915 I signed, produced his general theory. In 1917 he introduced what's called the cosmological constant. So you think of a, it was called lambda, you think of a v shape turned upside down, which is Amanda. And he introduced this term for the wrong reason because at that time people weren't, there was some indication in the universe was expanding, but not very clear. An Einstein, uh, I guess maybe didn't know I didn't believe it.

Speaker 1:          07:06          And this, the couples observations hadn't yet come to make a convincing case of the expansion. So I sign, I thought, well maybe the universe is static. It's kind of philosophically nice to think that it's sitting there all the time. And he couldn't make it do that. Uh, so he had to introduce this term called the cosmological constant. And he did that. And then not while very much longer after this Hobo showed that the universe does seem to be expanding. And Einstein regarded this lambda term as his biggest blunder, which is an irony because it turns out that this term is probably the explanation for the expansion of the universe that we now see. So it's what people call dark energy. I don't like the term very much cause it's neither dark, no proper energy in any clear sense. But still that was not worry about that.

Speaker 1:          08:03          Right. It's a, it's a, it's an odd term. Yes. I think so. It's a little confusing cause there's dark matter as well, which is quite different. You know, should, it must be confused with the dark energy as it's called, of the cosmological constant, which as far as we can tell, it is completely consistent with the observations. It's a positive number, very small, but seems to be producing this expansion. And I'm quite happy with that viewpoint because it leads to a picture, which I've been trying to plug for a while now, maybe up to 15 years. I can't remember. Um, the idea, I know it's hard to explain, but let me try. It came about because I was worrying about the remote future and I was thinking, okay, when these black holes around this fall in all the stars and they're just sitting around, and what's the most next exciting thing happening?

Speaker 1:          09:01          Well, the hawking evaporation, they're going to radiate away. Stephen Hawking showed that black holes had this temperature is extremely cold. I mean, these enormous ones are absurdly cold, much colder than anything made on the earth. And uh, but when the universe expands and expands and expands, it gets colder than the black holes. And so those black holes get, become the hottest, hottest things around. And so they radiate away very, very slowly. This hawking radiation and that carries energy. And so they shrink and shrink and the shrink and finally they disappear with a pop. I said pop is probably a pretty big explosion, but, but I'm not that big from a cosmological astrophysical scale. So the disappear, well it maybe been pretty boring when you're sitting around waiting for the black hole and go pop. But afterwards, that's really boring. So this was a picture I thought off and being rather depressed by it, thinking that stats are that fate.

Speaker 1:          10:00          You see the feed of all the interesting things happening. Ultimate fate is this unbelievably boring final state. Okay, this is an emotional argument, but giving me a bit of leeway. So I began to think, well, it's not going to be us who are going to be bored because we're not going to be around the main things that we'll be around. We'll be photons. And it's pretty hard to Bora photon for two very good reasons. One is it probably doesn't have conscious experiences. Not that sure. So, but the other is more of the science point that that they don't measure time because the photon has no mass. It travels at the speed of light and what the way relativity works, it means that clocks stopped if you like. So if it had experiences with the moment of its creation would be one moment and the next moment would be infinity.

Speaker 1:          10:53          And so they're just zip out to infinity without noticing thing. Now she had been doing work on this kind of thing, thinking more about gravitational radiation and how you measure it's energy and things like that. And it was a very useful picture too. Squashed down infinity. A useful thing to think about here, if you see these pictures by the Dutch artist Mc Escher. Yeah. And there are those which are called circle limits, and there's a very famous one with angels and devils interlocking and they get all crowded up onto the edge and they want, you've got to think about is that this is a kind of geometry called hyperbolic geometry, and the angels and devils live in that geometry and the ones right close to the edge think they're the same size and same shape as the ones in the middle. Oh, you got it. Great.

Speaker 1:          11:40          Yeah. And so the idea is that if you look at it from the angels and devils point of view, that's infinity, that boundary. But from our point of view, we can look at, and we have what's called a conformal map. That picture is a conformal map, but that means is that little shapes are quite consistently drawn, but there can be big or small and you don't care about whether they're big or they're small. Small shapes are accurate or angles if you like, her correctly drawn. So it's what's called a conformal map. And that can form a map, describes infinity. Now you can do the same thing to the universe. When I say do it, um, you can imagine it where this remote future, you can squash it down just like in the ash, a picture to a finite boundary. And as far as the things with no mass, they don't have a way of measuring how big or small it is.

Speaker 1:          12:38          The Maxwell equations don't know the scales, they don't care. It's that work just as well for smaller, so big and you can stretch it in someplace and squash it somewhere else. As long as the stretching and squashing is isotropic. So just as much one way as the other way, which means more or less that you keep what I call the light cones there. And it's not going to details here, but it means that if you have things without mass and most particularly the photons, then that boundary is just like anywhere else. And the photons go zipping up to it. And so you might think they've got to have somewhere to go, okay, well that's, you don't have to think that. But that was the point of view I had. The photons need to need somewhere to enter it in a way. But then where does it go?

Speaker 1:          13:21          But then there's the other picture, which is the opposite. Then there's the big bang. Now you can do a similar sort of trick there, which is stretching it out and making it into a boundary and that can be done too. I played around with these ideas for a long time and the standards, cosmology and models you can do it with, but the more complicated cosmology models you might have one, which a very complicated, big bang. The general ones don't look like that at all, so you need to condition which tells you that the big bang was a very special kind that it was. It's all tied up with this thing called the second law of thermodynamics and it all ties together with physics in a way which perhaps we don't have time to talk about, but it seemed to me a really good idea to have the condition on the big bang that you could continue it in the same way I should say.

Speaker 1:          14:13          The idea of doing this was a former student of mine, Paul Todd, who was a colleague of mine and he used this continuum conform. What continuation is, is a nice way of saying what the condition is on the big bang to give you what you want. But that's a huge condition, but it nevertheless, it's what starts our universe off in, in a very special state, which is what we live off in a way. It's the second law of thermodynamics and needs that to get going anyway. I don't know if you want to worry about that, but anyway, the point was that it looks as though it's a good condition on the big bang, but it also should be conformally. Uh, like a boundary, which if you had no mass, you wouldn't notice it. Okay. You've got particles with mass running around near the Big Bang, but as you get closer and closer and closer to the energy goes up, the temperature goes.

Speaker 1:          15:06          Zuni, zooming up these, zipping around at such a speed that the energy of their motion is much bigger than the equals MC squared mass. Einstein's mass, the energy in the mass is a certain amount, but when they get so hot, you can forget about the mass. So they like photons behave like particles without mass, and so they're just interested in the conformal geometry. So the crazy idea I had, not just on the stretch out of the big Vangie swatched on the infinity, but maybe our big bang was a squash down infinity of a previous Ian. So I'm saying our Ian began with a big bang, ended up with this exponential expansion. There was another one before us. They will be another one Ostriss. There was another one before that and so on. So it's an infinite cycle of big bangs. That's the picture and constant expansion to the point where there's no more energy and then somehow or another, a big bang comes out of that. Yes, that's right. Well, that's the tricky part that people have trouble. It's universally accepted that the big bang was an event. There's no a pretty well universally theories that are attractive.

Speaker 1:          16:25          I would say nothing terribly popular. There are certain ideas which say you can continue into the before the Big Bang Paul Steinhauser and what are they thinking? It's it's, it has things in common with my model but it's not quite the same. And you see it still is, he there wasn't right not long after Einstein produces theory and this Alexandra Friedman who was a Russian mathematical physicist and he produced the first cousin cause mammalogy mammals and one of these was a one which has sort of bounces and big bang. It expands and contracts again and it bounces and contract. And so that was the one of his models. The only trouble is if you put irregularities into these models, you get black holes and these black holes could pull McCook and incredible mess at the end. And that doesn't join onto a nice smooth, big bang. The next one.

Speaker 1:          17:16          So you have trouble with those models, but still people take these things seriously. And as I say, Steinhardt and tour, I kind of a model which is like that. So these are the things to think about. My own view is that they don't take into account the, the, the black hole problem, which is that, uh, my one gets rid of that because the black holes all evaporate away by hawking evaporation. And uh, so it forms a model. I used to give talks about this feeling quite happy. Nobody would ever prove it wrong so I can go on and talking loud. That's a no, I wasn't quite happy with that. And I thought maybe you could see signals coming through. So I had one idea about that, but more recently, and this is only just this year, um, I have to polish colleagues. That's a Christoph Meisner and Pav on your rough ski and there is a Korean who works in New York or Daniel an and we, the four of us have a paper, which I think today or tomorrow will be the new improved version of this paper should be on the archive.

Speaker 1:          18:21          And this, the title of the paper is, are we seeing hawking points in the CMB sky? Now what's a hawking point? He said it talks about the black holes. See in the previous aeon two hours, assuming it's more or less like ours, they will be black holes in clusters of galaxies. Huge, enormous ones swallowing up pretty well. The whole cluster. And what happens to the energy in those black holes? Well, it goes out in hawking radiation and it takes an age, ages and ages and ages, maybe 10 to a hundred year, Google years or something, ages and ages, but all that energy in the picture comes up basically one point. Think of that as your picture and right at the very edge you see that an awful lot of angels and devils squashed together there so that the entire radiation from that single black hole will be squashed into that little point.

Speaker 1:          19:16          And where on the other side, what do we see? Well, there will be a big release of energy at that point and that's what we call the hawking point and it spreads out. You see what we see in the cosmic microwave background. This is radiation coming from all directions and this radiation doesn't come from the big bang. Exactly. It comes from 380,000 years after the big bang. So there's a sort of last scattering surface where the photons which are trying to get out [inaudible] finally can escape. And we see them now that spread out from the hawking point to what you see and the cosmic microwave background in the last scattering surface is something of the diameter of about eight times the diameter of the moon. No bigger, no smaller. Now you wouldn't see the whole thing because our past cone, where were we? What we see it cut across it.

Speaker 1:          20:17          We don't see the whole thing, but we see probably most of it. So you could urge, imagine something from about four to eight times the moon's diameter, which is a small region which is highly energetic, more energetic in the middle and it tapers off as you go to the edge. And we seem to see these things, the analysis that um, that the polls, they have the techniques and the actual analyzing the data. This is the Planck satellite data who's done by Daniel [inaudible]. And then we look at the data and we seem to see an effect which see what you do is you, we've got only one universe. That's what to complain about. So how do you know if something's real or not? What you make zillions of fake universes and you compare this with them and there's a lot of technique about how you do this.

Speaker 1:          21:07          But um, Daniel first did a thousand of these fakes and they were sort of two sizes of these. You look at these rings to see whether the temperature goes out from the outside to the middle. And there were two sizes, both within the size of I'd say about four degrees across the sky. And um, there was no evidence of him at all in the simulation. So this is a real effect. Okay. Then people were skeptical of this for one reason or another. So Daniel did another, well 10,000 altogether and you cage Nunnelly they or to which do what, two or three to be precise where you see this effect in the simulations. But if you work out the probability that this is a real effect, you come up with a confidence level of 99.98% that this is a real effect. So we're waiting to see what people say about this.
