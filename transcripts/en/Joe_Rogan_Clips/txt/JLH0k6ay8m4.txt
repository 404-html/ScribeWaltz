Speaker 1:          00:00          Somehow or another make it seem like they would advance in the company more if they played along. Could be, yeah, I'm not going to do it because it feels so good. Yes, yes. Well you should encourage it, but I almost feel like, um, yeah, but you don't want to shame people. Like there's some brilliant people that don't work out at all. They're brilliant, but they just, whatever, for whatever reason, that's their choice and you know, it should be your choice to go out like Christopher Hitchens, it just fucking drink every day and smoke cigarettes and one day you get cancer and you're like, well, you know, I mean this is like, he mean he, the way he described it, like burning the candle at both ends, it gave a a beautiful, brilliant light. Yeah. He wouldn't have had those ideas if he had done in another way.

Speaker 1:          00:48          It's very possible. That's true. Most of the madness that we see in, in brilliant artists, like it's very, it's very possible that that man, this would not be expressed if they had their shit together. There was something that Sam Harris was saying the other day on your show just about about the free well stuff and I think that it, that connects to this information theory kind of thing. So if we're just sort of a conglomerate of these actions and words like flowing the, the actions through our body and unique ways. I mean do you accept his theory on freewill? Um, well it's not his theory or it's a conventional theory of determinism that a lot of people are, I'm embracing and I think there's definitely some merit to it. However, you and I both know that you choose whether or not you decide to do something right.

Speaker 1:          01:43          You choose whether or not you do. Like someone says, someone says something to you that's kind of Shitty and you choose whether you decide to email them back something shitty. Like you have that initial impulse like, well, hey man, fuck you. You have that initial impulse. You think on it, you sleep on it. But why are you thinking on it and sleeping on it? Are you doing that because of determinism? Are you doing that because you're trying to be a better person and are you trying to be a better person because of all the factors that played out in your life? Like environment, Jean's life experience, all those things, right. It means it's really good. It's a really good discussion. So do you own the words that you're saying right now? It's a good question. Larry Lessig, who's on here the other day. Yeah. You guys didn't even talk about this, but he basically is one of the founders of creative Commons and this whole licensing structure for content.

Speaker 1:          02:27          Like what we're saying right now, you know, this is going to be licensed. I don't know how, how's it different ways you and I as I'm a form right here, this discussion is going to be licensed you. Yeah. Okay. I mean, you're, I think you're licensing it in a certain way. Okay. So it will, you have the ability to license it however you want, right? You could say, hey, anyone can take this and cut it up and remix it. Or You could say, now it's locked down. Um, but he helped create this whole licensing array of like six different licenses. One says you can do absolutely anything you want with this and other says you can share it but you can't make money off it. There's a handful. And so the freewill stuff is connected to how we're dealing with information and like if you, cause if you, if you think realistic, we don't own what we're saying, we're a part of it, right?

Speaker 1:          03:18          We're a conduit where unique conduit. So it, I don't think it aligns with how the universe works to really be locking down information. I think that it makes sense probably in certain short term business, but you know, I think we have to open it up to what's really going on. What do you mean about like locking down information like source code, like classified files like our content, like music, like video and now how does this, how does this connect to determinism and whether or not you have freewill because it's a mess. Are, are you the creator of your information? Will, you are certainly if you put in the work, like let's say you decided to write a book. I mean you put hundreds and hundreds of hours into this book and edit this book and then you release the book and someone says, no, you didn't. You didn't create that.

Speaker 1:          04:21          You are, you're a product of determination and I'm going to just steal your book. That's intellectual theft. Intellectual theft is real. It's, it's certainly real in terms of like creation of content, right? If you're a standup comedian and someone takes your countless hours of work and steals it, that's intellectual theft for sure. And then they try to pawn it off as their own, through their own selfish needs. A selfish means. That's why attribution is the key part of the creative Commons licensing structure. Always saying if you come up with a joke, you know it came from here, but what if it's a profit? Like say if you wrote a book and a, I say, hey, this is a great book written by Bill Ottman. Give me five bucks for it and putting it up on my site and you to it. Fuck that. I mean, here's the thing, I don't, somebody makes all the money off of your book because they have a better platform to sell your book and they don't give it to you at all.

Speaker 1:          05:11          And you wrote the book, you spent all the time, you did all the work. I would for certain content that I create completely give it away. That sounds like a guy who's never written a book. I've written a book. Did you? I mean I've, I've written a lot of content. Yeah. But have you written, I give away, I give, I've not published, but the book that you sell, like if you were an author, but say if you were, I'm not saying people should be forced to do this or I'm just saying that this I think is how creativity happens. And I just, I just don't, people deserve to make money on their content. Right. And you deserve to own your stuff. But I don't think that that's actually how the universe works. And I don't think it's acceptable to say, Oh, free. You know, free will doesn't exist.

Speaker 1:          06:03          I own your content. But, um, yeah, that's why I'm struggling to see how they're connected. Because if you're not the originator, then you're not the owner. That's a weird argument because you are the originator. Stephen King wrote all Steven Qr. You're the unique conduit. You are the originator of that specific configuration of information and you deserve to be able to do everything you're saying with it. I'm just saying that, I don't know. It's complex. Well, it is complex. If you're saying that all human beings, essentially, all of your actions have been determined by a lot of factors that are outside of your control. Whether it's genetics, again, life experience, education, all the different factors, your environment. Um, is that what's causing you to uh, put out a fucking brilliant record? It's part of it, right? But maybe you have 50, maybe you have 50%, everything else has 50% or there's weed, I don't know what the percentages, but if you're a musician and someone like Spotify comes along and says, boot do, you didn't even make that dude, so we're just going to put it on Spotify and make millions and give you pennies.

Speaker 1:          07:24          That's not what I'm advocating. I'm, I'm saying [inaudible] uses the blues died. Well more than that. More than that. There's, yeah. Yeah. This a real plagiarism. So, but that doesn't, that doesn't mean that those aren't great records. That's true. It is true. Yeah. I mean, it's a led Zeppelin, this legit gray area. You know, I found out this bill Burke called me up and left us really disturbed message. He was like really bummed out when he watched in bill's a musician, he's a drummer. And when he saw videos of led Zeppelin music played, and the band that used to open for led Zeppelin, we played it on the podcast. We were like, Holy Shit. Like they just stole stuff. They just stole giant chunks and rifts and you know, and, and I mean, they made it better I guess. But, but yeah, but that's a different thing than Stephen King's book.

Speaker 1:          08:21          Why? Because Stephen King had to spend countless hours in front of his laptop trying to go over each and every sentence and each and every paragraph and suck you in and it, all this work. No, they stole stuff, dude. They sold certain phrases. But you think he didn't use a single phrase anywhere in any of his books that he didn't pull from something? We certainly has. Yeah. He certainly has. Um, I don't think it's the same though. I think it's similar led Zeppelin, what? They also had to spend countless hours recording that performance to get it to the level of awesomeness. That way I heard that wasn't easy to do. They just did a bitch ass move and they didn't pay those people. Yeah. If you, no matter what you should be attributing, if you're taking ideas, put in the footnotes, why does it hurt? It doesn't make your art worse because then they'd have to admit they stole the riff for Stairway to heaven from their opening band.

Speaker 1:          09:17          And then people would go, what? And then they would see it. Then they would look at led Zepplin differently. But you know, human beings are fucking severely flawed. Um, I don't know if I buy that with this, this idea that you're saying in terms of like a authors creating content. I'm not trying to sell something. No, I know, but if they are, I don't think someone should be able to copy their stuff and sell it. I don't think they should either. But what do you think they do license? I think using it should be able to do you think? Okay, you should be able to decide. So if you the content creator, you should. Okay. I agree with that. Yeah. Yeah, it's, it is. I mean obviously I play devil's advocate a lot, but that's how you get to the bottom and these conversations. But it is a very complicated issue.

Speaker 1:          10:00          The complicated issue of who you are and why you are who you are and who you are at this moment versus who you are a decade ago or two decades ago. It's, it's all very weird, you know? I mean you go back and think about stuff from high school and you're like, Jesus, what am I really? Even that person, like I think about like I've, I've talked to my sister about stuff that happened when were in high school. Hey, you remember that guy? And all he said to say hi and like I was not even me. Do I ever know that person? Like is that really me? Cause I, if I, if I see them again, I'll be like, oh yeah. Oh yeah, we had a 10th grade science together. Oh yeah. Huh? Crazy. Like I ran into a guy from my high school like a couple of weeks ago and it was weird. It was so weird. You know, he remembered some strange story from English class and I was like, wow, you remember that? Like how weird. And while he was talking me, I'm like, is that even really me? Like, cause even really talking about me because I don't have any connection to the stuff that he's saying. And I understand that he has, it's vague, distant ghostlike memory in his mind of some, some slide images that he's pieced together that he recognizes as a, a past interaction. I mean, it's fucking strange.
