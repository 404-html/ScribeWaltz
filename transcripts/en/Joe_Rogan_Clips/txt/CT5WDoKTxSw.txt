Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello Freak bitches. Well, it becomes a thing like with Floyd Mayweather, you know, like a big thing about Floyd Mayweather is how much money he makes is not just that he's a great boxer. It's that he's going to make $300 million. Apparently it's gonna be even more than that. And you see the paper view numbers, they're talking about 6.5 million paper view bys. Wow. So it's more than 2 million more than the Manny Pacquiao fight. That's insane. Does that include the re potential refunds? Did they that's good question. Well, to be fair, he did nickname of self money Mayweather. Well, he did. He was pretty boy Floyd. He changed it, but yeah. Then he built the persona around, I spend money he doesn't have to do. I mean it is cool and good for him, but he did make a big thing about spitting money that one time he showed up like a hundred million dollar check was so stupid.

Speaker 1:          00:56          I'm like, wait, why is that on like a regular ass check? Yeah. She was just like in a regular chase bank check. It wasn't even a big cardboard one. Nate even net or print it out or print it out on a, or even a wire or something. I wouldn't get that wire. Yeah, laminate that thing. I think that's real. He's really holding on to a $100 million check, but it was just a regular ass check that you would buy groceries on in eighties yeah. Yeah. That 100 million. Yeah. I guess he wrote it to himself. So it's made with it promotions. General artists. Yeah. Yeah. You got 100 million in a bank of America, I guess so. It seems like he just holds onto it too. Hey, he doesn't catch it. That's a weird out of his book bag at one of the, uh, yeah, I saw it, but I mean, why is he hanging on to that? Why does it, but you should probably catch that in his other account anyways, this Mayweather promotions account. Who cares instead of bay where the personal account, the checking. So he's probably gonna make more than $300 million from this last fight. Sure. Yeah. Amazing. I can't imagine that they won't do that again. That him and Connor won't do it again with a wet finger if he kind of can figure out how to not get tired.

Speaker 1:          02:13          If he could convince people like say if he fights Paulie Malignaggi he's in. That beats the shit out of Paulie Malignaggi and then says Freud do it one more fucking time. And I think Floyd, Nah man, come on. We did that. Oh I know. He starts thinking about that and money could bro, if you can figure out a way to get people excited about it, Connor could get somehow, somehow or another get more people to pay attention because it was an interesting fight for the first three or four rounds. It's made it, he made it look interesting, but it really wasn't interesting. I thought it was interesting, but then when I thought back it wasn't interesting. Well he caught point clean. You know, he caught him with an uppercut in the first round. Nobody hits Floyd clean like that. Lloyd underestimated in my thoughts. So wasn't, he wasn't doing that shoulder roll.

Speaker 1:          02:59          No, he was. Cause he wanted to, he didn't believe in kindness pops. So Floyd usually boxes and you think that's what it is when you always see him boxing that like he box Canelo and he does that and, and he goes off of that counter. I don't think that's what it was. I think he knew the Conner was going to get tired if he was backing up. You know that Connor has an endurance problems and uh, as long as he wasn't throwing a lot of punches, which Floyd wasn't, and he's constantly faking and moving, he's got kind of backing up. He could be, it's way easier to be defensive if you're not being offensive. So if you're not thinking about hitting the guy, if you're constantly like fainting and you got your hands up and you're moving forward, but really what you're thinking about is what he's throwing, you can get away with a lot and you're, you can press forward a lot more because you're going to see the punches coming.

Speaker 1:          03:46          Cause you're not really thinking too much about throwing your own punches unless he's like a clear wide opening. So for the first couple of rounds, he's mostly like putting pressure on them, sizing. And Mom when I watched it after the fight, it became way more obvious like why you're watching it. You're like, what's going to happen? What's going to happen once you already know what's, what's happened? Then uh, then I watched it and I said, oh, I could see exactly what he's doing. He's fainting, putting a lot of pressure on Conor and he's making kind of backup a lot, which is exhausting. And then also kinda is not very efficient. He's not a boxer. So like there's a lot of energy being wasted. Like he, he's going to get tired more easily and then he doesn't run. So he doesn't have the same kind of endurance of Floyd has. It's a lot, a lot of factors in there. Yeah. It was a Honda 11 punches, but some of them were like, yeah, all the ones that Connor landed. You mean it was a few of them that were like little [inaudible] yeah. Yeah. There were also like weird ones like patty, patty peck punches to the side of the head. They in the back of the head. This is one meme that it sells is kind of this and it just says fuck this box and shit.

Speaker 1:          04:49          Well, you know, you get used to that in MMA. You know you get used to hammer fists. Well, I think that's what I saw. I was talking about the ENA and a lot of other people were just wondering if muscle memory is going to just kick in and he was going to do some weird information and it did kick in a little bit, but not to the extreme. Yeah, there was some massive penalties for any, so if he had any sort of a point deduction or anything that they did, is something illegal. I think he had a massive penalty, more than a million dollars for each thing. He fucked up 10 mil, 10 mil each one. That makes sense. That tin mill makes you get your shit together. As long as he's not, doesn't get disqualified. It might be worth it. Like 10 million for one fucking knee to the body.
