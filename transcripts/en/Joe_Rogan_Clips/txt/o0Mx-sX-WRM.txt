Speaker 1:          00:00          How would they stop congressmen from becoming lobbyists? Well, one thing they do a, and then I build loopholes into it, but one thing they can do is they can basically say, um, once your congressman you can't be alive is for five years and five years or whatever the time is. But the more fundamental factors, you know, if you change the way you fund campaigns, if it was no longer the lobbyists who are kind of channeling the money in or that we're getting their clients to channel the money in, then it's not like there wouldn't be lobbyists anymore. They just wouldn't be so well paid. They wouldn't be as valuable. And if they're not as valuable, it's not as valuable for them to pay the congressmen and incredible amount of money to become con, uh, lobbyists. You know, they would become almost like, you know, lawyers policy wonks that kind of go to Capitol Hill and say, here's what will happen if you adopt this legislation.

Speaker 1:          00:49          You know, that's an important part of the process. But they wouldn't be the mockers in the system. They wouldn't be the people who called the shots. And so the value of their services would fall and if the value of their services fell, then, um, it wouldn't make so much sense to go and become a lobbyist. Maybe you'd come home and be a doctor again or come home and like be a business person again or do whatever you want, uh, back in your district. So I think if you change the way you fund campaigns, you would change 70% of the problem. You would just fix it right then. And these other things that good additions, but not as critical. But without changing the way you fund campaigns, I think all of these other changes that are irrelevant, they just can't get over the money. You will always hear the phrase, take money out of politics.

Speaker 1:          01:32          It's a constant phrase, but that's not really possible now. And underneath it gets really good. The point isn't, the point isn't to get money out. The point is to get money that doesn't represent a tiny fraction of the special interests controlling how congress people think. So, um, I think today a congressman from California Rogue Kahana is going to introduce a bill that he hopes will be eventually part of whatever this big reform packages that would create, um, a way of funding campaigns where everybody gets a voucher or a set of vouchers. You know, Seattle has done this for city elections where everybody gets for $25 vouchers. They're only usable to fund campaigns. So a candidate comes around and tries to persuade you to give him or her the voucher and then they take that voucher and they use it to fund campaigns. Okay. If Roca Han is bill passed and everybody had vouchers to use to fund congressional campaigns, and you know, the idea is basically you take the rebate of the first $50 of your taxes, which every American pays at least $50 to the federal government.

Speaker 1:          02:36          You take that first $50, you'd give it back and you give it in the form of a voucher and you say, take this voucher and help fund campaigns with it. Congressman would still be raising money. They'd still be spending a large time raising money, but they wouldn't be raising money from the tiny fraction of the 1% they'd be raising money from everybody. And so the point is that you would be using that money to spread the influence in the way that democracy is supposed to spread the influence to every American as opposed to the influence in a tiny, tiny fraction of the 1% so that wouldn't get less money. I think that could be more money in the system, but it wouldn't be corrupting money because it would be money that is democratically accountable.
