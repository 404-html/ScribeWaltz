Speaker 1:          00:00          You know what the best ones, like all of them. Most of my friends, we all got busted for drinking and driving. The best one was a buddy of mine. Uh, they read his, who's like, you know, approximately four in the morning, we noticed a Maroon VW, Fox blowing its horn trying to pass on the right. We pulled the defendant over, uh, after repeatedly asking the defendant to stay in the car. He got out of the car, threw his keys at my feet and uh, repeatedly stated, lock me up. I'm fucked.

Speaker 1:          00:34          And this was funny was my buddy was a good look can guy and though the judge was a, was a woman and when the guy read that, you know, lock me up, I'm fucked up. And he wasn't the brightest guy and he just kind of, when he went like, oh, he's like put his head down like that. And he was, you know, a little pound puppy fucking looking dude. And uh, she, uh, she, she gave him like a lighter sentence and cause he was good looking. I think so, yeah. Plays in. It gets why ugly people are complain so much. Like they won't take the time to develop a fucking personality. Right? Some jokes do it. The rest of us have to do like I don't get mad at Brad Pitt. You know I haven't me fucking cause he's fucking beautiful. I'm a fucking bald, redheaded mail.

Speaker 1:          01:22          I know where I am in the pecking order and some of these fucking people who are complaining right now who are mad that beautiful people get treated differently. I understand racially speaking, but you're not going to do the beautiful thing. And then, then there's another thing they tried to say. Well Society tries to, you know, they're the ones that fucking did like, you know, like I love when like there's a supermodel, like the dude, this is like an impossible standard of beauty to try and live up to. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's why she's on the cover of a magazine. She's that level. Beautiful. And you're going to try and sit there and tell me that that was learned. Well, here's the thing that's only women because when you see Jason Mamoa playing aqua man, you don't hear men say that's an impossible standard of beauty that we have to, no, I just make fun of it. It's fucking stupid that tries to, hang on sir.

Speaker 2:          02:15          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:16          I don't care how much you can kick my ass. That is the dumbest shoes. Me On a fucking serial box. It's a trident. For years they had a problem like with aqua man. It's like he's in the ocean. Human beings are on earth like, what do we like? I have to see that fucking movie. What are they going to be? Is it going to be like Japanese people like fitting? He's busy going to save sharp. He goes under water. Is that a skin? Well, the bumps. What is that? Is that a suit? It doesn't water get in the gloves. I think that that have to be all one piece, right? Yeah. You'd be annoying as shit is any worse than water and your gloves will look. It looks like it catches them like a water catcher, like not just like water gets in the gloves. It's like a funnel. He looks like a stripper at a Bachelorette party. Does a good why she pays

Speaker 3:          03:00          money. You got a good one. God dieted down for that. Um, yes he did and he got all the ABS. So he's B's better than I am. Always this button that says this is the fall look for one. Yep. This is when he's in the Black Sea. You know what I mean? He wants to fucking gets cold. Yeah. Did you see what's going on in the UK? The UK is banned advertisements that a feature, a unobtainable bodies. There's a racist tweeted recently. The way they eat fish and chips over there. This can be most of advertising. Well they had these ads for summer bodies. You know, you see a girl in a bikini and they're now making it illegal.

Speaker 1:          03:37          Why can't you aspire to that? Like I look at that aqua man guy that makes me want to go to the gym. I know.

Speaker 3:          03:43          Oh you know he's got a full head of hair look like you've got to make me feel better. It's because the people that complain who are the people that complain and the people that complain to the people that don't want to work to be that lady, they don't want to work to get that kind of a body and they want to, they just want to not see it. They don't want any it. They don't want to go to the subway and see a body that they never,

Speaker 1:          04:01          yeah, I saw it. I saw an actress complaining one time cause the studio total that she needed to lose 15 pounds and like you can't drop 15 to star in a movie. I mean what, what carrot can they specifically carrots, some veggies in your diet. What are they have to dangle in front of you to go to the fucking gym? Like the rest of us, like I literally like, cause I always say, oh guys not to deal with that. It's like yeah we do. Of course. Yes we do like how to deal with that to gain 20 pounds to forget about him. If just having five lines in a fucking movie. If I am north of 171 72 pounds, the fucking tweets, I get a Billy booze bag. Hey Billy Bitch tits, hey fat, freckles, all of this shit that I get like I know like they sit there and they like it.

Speaker 1:          04:44          They had like a, they're acting like like fucking preteens where everything is just everything's about them and the whole fucking world gives us shit celebrities with their fucking political views as the funniest thing ever. It's like all you're, you're not, you're not making anybody changed their mind politically. I think I need a FAC and speak up. It's like, no, you can't have the spotlight on you enough. That's all you're doing because all you're doing with that bullshit is you. First of all, you're alienating half the fucking people that are going to go see whatever the fuck you're in. And then secondly, you're just getting on the radar of lunatics in white vans with two seats that are looking up how to fucking build pipe bombs like that. That's, that's the fallout. It's like the jerk when he goes to the average run of the mill, son of a bitch. He had already picked Steve Martin.

Speaker 3:          05:30          The idea that a girl shouldn't be asked to lose weight, to look hot for a movie is fucking crazy because that's what you're playing. You're playing a hot woman

Speaker 1:          05:37          and there's part of the job and there's millions to everybody's in shape. I remember fucking CNI. He's still a bit about this. I saw a Ben Stiller in, in meet the Fockers or something. There was a scene where he had to have his shirt off in the pool. He had fucking abs and a comedy. Yeah. Cause that's, cause you was seeing the influence for the fucking Internet. You know what I mean? It goes just like, you know, he, he gets in your head, people just fucking trash and you like, I already knew I was unsightly, but I didn't realize how many things that people didn't enjoy about until I got on the Internet. I was like, wow, I never noticed that about myself. So, um, yeah. I don't have 'em. Look if somebody really has like a fucking eating disorder, you know, I feel like fucking obese. I have sympathy for those people. But you 15 pounds, 20 pounds overweight, I mean fucking and you know it. Did he drink some fucking smoothies?

Speaker 3:          06:26          These women that are playing these roles have to understand first of all, that part of the reason why you got that role is not just because of your acting ability, but also because you're pretty, you have a beautiful face. You were born with it. You didn't even work at it. And then on top of that, you're supposed to be playing a beautiful person in the movie. They would like you to not be fat.

Speaker 1:          06:43          Well, it also, discrimination is millions of dollars at stake. There could be lost. So I always feel like your job is Amy, if you look like me, is to show up on time knowing your lines in the best possible shape you could get yourself in that. That's the role that's I even if I'm just fucking,

Speaker 3:          07:00          what about your Artie Lange? What if you're already laying in, you're supposed to play the guy that smoking cigarettes and you're the brother in law that's drunk all the time, then your job is to look that way. You just slipped away. Her job is looking at the hot woman that everybody wants to fuck. If they're telling you you have to lose weight and you're, you're a beautiful woman, it's because they want to make you more attractive. It's, there's not like discrimination. There's a reason they want a better product because we want to make money. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:22          They wanted to try and make them a better product. And uh, I'll tell you nothing to like really that those both male and female, like those beautiful people at that level, it's like they're fucking aliens. Like I, I've done a couple of movies. I did a movie one time and I remember, uh, it was a scene, we were in a car and the star of the movie was holding onto the steering wheel. And I was like, I never thought this ever about a woman. I was like, her forearms are gorgeous. I was looking at me like, I was like, those forearms are perfect, but I didn't make me when I went to Stockholm, Sweden, how beautiful the people were there. I was walking down the street pointing at guys with my wife, go knit, look at that guy, look at that. That fucking guy, like he's like an accountant walking down the street.

Speaker 1:          08:07          Like does he know if he fucking came over here? He'd be starring in movies and that's not all a Sweden by the way. That's like just when you're in Stockholm, that's like their Manhattan. So all the beautiful fucking people. But I mean I went to a couple of, I went to this magnet, played in a but like a a magazine or something like that when I was over there. And the woman behind the counter was like a fucking 11 here, but she was working at a magazine stand. So that was her energy. Like, hey, how are you doing? I'm working in magazines. Then my dream hasn't come true yet. And you just looking at him like you, you could sign with the WHO's that big a modeling agency. Yeah. Like that all like Cindy Crawford

Speaker 3:          08:44          and all of them are worth back in the day, the Vikings, it's viking blood. They the best looking people. They, they went over there and raped and pillaged and all that good DNA is left there. They cut the best. They kept him alive.

Speaker 1:          08:56          Killed everybody else. Oh, is that what happened? Yeah. I don't know what happened. That's why they're so big. Beautiful. Oh yeah. No, this super small. That's one of the funniest things happen when you go over to the, to like, uh, the, uh, what do they call those? The Nordic and then Scandinavia's within the Nordic countries. I always have to remind myself that like, you go over there, it was the funniest fucking shit cause he's so god damn tall. They would be kids almost my height, whose voices hadn't changed yet. And they had the mentality of like an 11 year old they'd make, he said they was speaking that I did hide it. He aged out. If you're talking voice and change that. And I was just sitting there laughing my ass off. Go. These are like fucking, yeah, they like, everybody was like, uh, like six, three, six, four, six, five like rail thin with their fucking European pants.
