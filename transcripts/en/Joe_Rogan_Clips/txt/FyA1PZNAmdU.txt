Speaker 1:          00:00          So now let's talk about mass shootings. Mass shootings, right? So get rid of gun free zones. No one wants to hear that. Get rid of gun free zones. If you're not going to establish a perimeter outside of a building where I can go, don't tell me I can't bring my gun in there. A sign on the window is not stopping somebody from coming into the building. We've seen it time and time and time and time again. If the guns were the problems, we would have mass shooting at every gun show every single day. But we don't. Why the same reason you pointed out why that one, that one place in Georgia when they said everybody had to have a gun, crime went down. People don't want to hear that though. They don't want to hear the answer to gun violence is everyone has a gun.

Speaker 1:          00:46          No, not such a convenient answer for a guy like you is very convenient. So many guns you can't count. But here, let's look at the alternative. We've been living in it, right? Right. And we knowledging that there's a problem, right? So why are we entertaining? In the fact that maybe that is the case, right? But do you think that like school shootings, for example, do you think that these teachers being armed and would be the answer? I all right, so, or do you think there should be armed security on the campus? I say it should be multilayered, right? Because if you, if you really want to put things into perspective, and the NRA didn't add about this and people got pissed off, but it's the truth. Wherever whatever school the president's kids go to, they are guarded by guns, right? That school was protected by guns, right?

Speaker 1:          01:30          Right. Anything we hold valuable in this country is protected with guns. No one is more anti gun than Hollywood. When you hear about any sort of crime or gun violence, the left wing people in Hollywood are the most vocal, the most virtue signaling the quickest to jump on their pedestal. Meanwhile, what percentage of their fucking movies involve gun violence? And if you look at the Academy Awards, did you see the security at the Academy Awards? Right? You see all these left leaning liberal actors being protected by people at flak jackets on carrying guns with fingers outside the triggers. I mean, dogs, it's crazy. You know what it is though. It's a loss of touch with reality. Well, they're also insulated and protected. Well, that's part of it because in her mind, their mindset goes like this. Well, I have security guards. I mean Kim Kardashians, the biggest, I did a video on that.

Speaker 1:          02:35          So I had to have his first thing that came to Vegas. What she biggest apricot on that. Right. Because she's a dumb dumb. Yeah, of course. But she's, she also influences a ton of people. Yeah. That's unfortunate. But exactly. Steve Harvey had her on family feud. They were on family feud, the Kardashians and the West. We're talking about how fucking stupid kid was. But we know this though. That's the crazy thing. She, there's no incentive for to be intelligent. There isn't, I mean, she's good at making money. Oh absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. And I don't fault her for that. Hey, make your money. But, but people, but at the end of the day, you still, she still has access to scores of young, influential minds. I understand that. That's unfortunate, but it's not, and we can do about that. There isn't, but other than you point out the fact that she's a dumb dumb.

Speaker 1:          03:23          Pretty much. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's not terrible person. I don't know. I don't know the woman. I just don't, well, I've heard a talk. I just don't think she's really interested in expanding your mind. I just don't think that that's something that's not benefits. But that's her. Here's the thing about the mindset though, is there are people who we paid to carry guns. Right? I don't need to carry them. Therefore you don't either. So you're saying about her is that she is anti gun, she talks about being anti gun, yet she's constantly surrounded by people who have guns. That's a fact. Absolute fact. So you cancel this fact, so then you can't turn around and tell me that no, you don't need a firearm. Right. Of course you don't. Just seven foot tall dudes strapped to the fucking gills all around you. Yeah. Yeah. So it, it's, it's man, it's frustrating because it's like, I get it.

Speaker 1:          04:17          I would love to have a dude standing out here with ar 15 slung over their shoulders ready to protect me. How to give a notice when I could afford it. I pay for it, not do it. The funny thing is I still carry a gun on me because they can't always be exactly where I am. Right. You know what I mean? That's a paranoid way to live though, isn't it? What difference does it make you think about it? How much does it affect me? I wake up everyday, put a gun on my hip and go out and do the exact same thing I would do if I didn't have it. But you don't think about it. So in the, in a sense you feel like you're not paranoid. I'm not paranoid. No, there's no, no, no, no more paranoid than any than any person that has a fire extinguisher in their house. Think about it. It's a, it's like I don't walk around like, Oh my God, I'm my God, who's, who's coming to get me? That's paranoia. What, what all I'm doing is being prepared, right? Well, there could be levels of preparedness. You start to hit diminishing returns. Where starts to be like, it starts to take away from your quality of life, but me putting a gun on my hip and just go on about my business, that doesn't interfere with my life enough to say, you know what, and it's not quite worth it.
