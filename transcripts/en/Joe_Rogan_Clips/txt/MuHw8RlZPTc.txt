Speaker 1:          00:00          I went hunting for big foot for a television show I did for Scifi. I called Joe Rogan questions, everything. And we went looking for bigfoot. And the more I talk to these big foot folks, the more I was convinced none of these motherfuckers had ever seen bigfoot until there's one lady that I talked to, one lady who just did not seem like a liar. And she was telling me that she saw something in the woods and it was standing up and it was tall, like seven, eight feet tall. And she's like, why is there a gorilla in the woods? And then she's like, oh my God, that's pig foot. And they shed and it was a Pacific northwest, uh, outside of a Washington state or in Washington state, outside of Seattle. And the woods are so dense up there that if anything goes 10, 20 feet, it's gone.

Speaker 1:          00:43          The problem with that is that there's black bears up there and black bear sometimes stand up on two feet. They do it all the time. And if you saw a black foot, especially a black bear rather, especially from a distance, you would think it was a big gorilla if he was standing up on two feet, which they do do, especially when they're trying to see something, they'll stand up and they'll even walk. There's a lot of videos of them walking on two feet and just on the right career they seen it. That's crazy. I could see a big 400% so I think, I don't think that lady is a liar. I just don't, she might, let me look. It might be real. There might be a few of them left. There definitely was a thing called gigantic [inaudible] that lived in Asia. And the thought is that it came across the Bering land bridge the same time that native Americans came across from Asia and that they came across and you know, cause they lived in Asia and this, this gigantic [inaudible] I think lived as recently, I think as a hundred thousand years ago.

Speaker 1:          01:37          I think the, the, the most recent fossils they have of it, which is, you know, human beings were alive back then. And this thing was a six or a, an eight to 10 foot tall bipedal hominid. So it was a huge, huge ape like creature. So check this out. This is a look at this. Bear to the craziest shit ever. Bears walking on two legs. I look at him. Wow. Like if you saw that, you'd be like, totally. Yeah. Yeah. You can just feel like, oh my God, it's a fuck his pig foot. Especially if you believe the hype, your search for big foot out there. Yes. Or if you're on shrooms. Yeah. Right. I mean, if you're walking around, if you're high on mushrooms, you're like, oh my God, Beth, what's real? Leave that thing. He's like, hey, how you doing? Oh, he's got to hurt.

Speaker 1:          02:22          Right foot. That's what that is. You see his right foot or something wrong with his right foot sometimes. Yeah. It looks like he's missing his front. Pollatos sometimes. Um, you know, bears will fight with each other and one barrel bite the other bears foot off or he could have gotten shot or it could have broke it off on something. Yeah. That's crazy. Yeah. He's missing a foot. So He's, he's walking around out there like a gorilla, but everybody else, I was like, wow, I'm talking to them. They're like living in make believe world. Here's another one. Walking around. I look at him. Wow. That is weird, man. Those are big as bears to big Asbestos Hill on two feet. I mean, look, they look like fucking people, man. I think that is a big reason why. And then they're feeding them. That is so crazy. Where is that? That doesn't seem like America. South Korea. Is it South Korea? Yeah. Wow. Oh, so that's one of those wildlife parks where the animals are all and you're in a car. Yeah. That's like fake wildlife. I mean wildlife, but not really wild.
