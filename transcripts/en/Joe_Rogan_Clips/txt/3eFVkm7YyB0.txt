Speaker 1:          00:00          Oh, pigs are the weirdest one because pigs, like my friend Whitney Cummings, she adopted a pig. That what? What did she get that pig? I think it was from the fire, right? Yeah. And she actually wound up driving it to Texas. She drove in her car 24 hours. She's a fucking maniac when it comes to animals. I think her and her fiance drove to Texas with this fucking pig to drop it off at this pig shelter and damn dude, when you, she's with that pig. That thing is like a dog. Might as well be my dog. Like hanging out

Speaker 2:          00:33          intelligent animal. Yeah. But

Speaker 1:          00:37          when they get loose and they're out in the wild boy, they fucking breathe three, four times a year. They'll have big piles of piglets and those piglets will destroy, they eat everything in sight there. Omnivorous devastate. You guys see, so for everything, they're devastating to plants and ground nesting birds, animals, everything. They eat everything in front of them. They're pigs.

Speaker 2:          00:58          Yeah. And I hide them. No, I kind of hide them. I'll pigs. I think they're an unreasonable, but the bigger picture is I need to be controlled. They can't go out there and just ruin the, you know, how ecosystem like that.

Speaker 1:          01:09          Well, there's, you're seeing in Texas, Texas is probably in the United States is the biggest example of what happens when, or the best example of what happens in these feral hogs are just completely out of control. They just devastate these agricultural farms. They have these farms and they're just getting destroyed.

Speaker 2:          01:27          Yeah. I mean, and I told the wog life of a wildlife as well because I eat frogs and I'll lean Lee's it now. Anything that's on the ground that's edible though. Eight. Uh, yeah. Um, I wrote an article years ago, it was cold, a killer at the pass. It was a place in Australia and the, the property owners like the ranch has called me up and I said, you need to come out and shoot some of the foxes. Like they're devastating our lambs. And, uh, I end up going out there and when I was driving in with the forward drive at night, if the high beams on, I seen this massive big black and white ball walking between the flock of sheep with a lamb in its mouth. There was this pig and it had got a taste for meat and it happens all the time. Like so a big bore, especially in mature animal will get a taste for meat in harsh conditions and they'll just stick to meet after that.

Speaker 2:          02:14          And uh, I ended up catching up with these pig the next morning and shot it with the bow and it actually attacked me. The first shot wasn't perfect and it charged me and I ended up like stabbing it to death. I was on a slope like this on the mountain and it was really a battle like that. He ended up hooking the bow out of my hand because when he charged me, I put an Arrow on and shot and just went down one side and like hit one lung and it just in fear I did this ball and he was on me. And, um, when I was fending them off with the bow is tasked, went into the bottom limb or the bow or the cam or something like that and rip the boat and my hand and I ended up getting me knife off me and I end up like stabbing his pig was like trying to run me over.

Speaker 2:          02:53          Oh Shit. How big was it? It was a big boy is like big meeting. It made eight and ball like this and like how many pounds? Oh, I fucking big. That's how many pounds. Probably not 300 down mountain boys just get real solid. Yeah, probably 200 or something like that. And uh, anyway, I ended up stabbing this thing to death and when I end up cutting it open, it's whole insides. Like it's whole stomach was like lambs hawks, like the feet, the bottom of the feet where they can't swallow and skulls and just like little bits of a woolen stuff like that. He'd just been going around and just picking these lambs off and killing them. Yeah. And it's a really known occurrence in Australia. And how that, if things get harsh, I would just go, they'll just, cause they, they just absolutely ruthless. I would just walk right between the sheep and just fucking grab a lamb walk off of it. It up and Nigga buy anyway. First thing that morning that I found was a pig spew and it was like this fucking spew like this and it was the same as lamb's hawks speaks vomit. Oh you don't say Spew America? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:56          Do. But I wasn't a thought. It meant something else to you.

Speaker 2:          03:59          Yeah. Fucking spewing mate. Yeah, spew, spew it out. That's what happened at Disney yesterday. Fucking Walt Disney spewed all over me. So they just threw up bones just for our bones and stuff that it couldn't digest but end up lamb killer at the past

Speaker 1:          04:16          [inaudible] of animal. And there's so ruthlessly efficient in terms of like how much food.

Speaker 2:          04:20          Yeah. So a deal walk along and it will pick, you know, it would just pick the top soft grass and the grass regrows you know, a pig. We'll go through and eat that grass and it will turn it over and eat the roots and everything goes well. Core just causes a lot of erosion and then there's no regrowth cause there's no roots in the ground that greedy pigs, they greedy pigs. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:40          About 'em you don't hit the number one cause of death on farms. Really? Yeah. Apparently with a domestic animals, people falling into pig pens and just into them they just devour. And you know when you're dealing with these giant domestic pigs they get fucking huge, massive yeah. Hundreds of pounds.

Speaker 2:          04:59          Yeah. In like Western New South Wales when times get tough, which is like seems to be fucking all the time now. But um, they'll get so desperate like you'll shoot a pig, you're going for it for the farmer and you just shoot it to me. Not even really taken any made often because they like they can, they are eat meat, their self and their like skin and bones and disgusting as more of like a coal mission and you'll come back in the afternoon. That pig will be completely skin and bones cause the other pigs just get in there and just, and you'll hear him, you'll just hear him just screaming. It's the most God awful sound there is.

Speaker 1:          05:34          Cannibalize that. Cannibalize. Yeah. I was in to hone ranch and we were walking by this really high grass. The grass is like five foot high and you, we were only like maybe 10 yards away from these pigs fighting and I said to Rinella, I said, no, come on man. If you didn't know that those were pigs, if I told you there was demons in that case, you would, you would completely believe it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was great. But it sounded like Lord of the rings. So like some horrific scene. No monster movie. Yeah. It sounded like an aura. It really did. I mean they're there. It's just how was that the same animal as those cute little things that Whitney Cummings is totally cause the one that she had was like, oh, fluffy and sit in her bed Q, loving it that she taught her how to go outside. Go. Was it a cake wean pig? No, it was a pig. I, that was the other thing she told me. Apparently those little pigs are not real. All they are is just underfed. That's pretty fucking, that's fucked up. Like when those people have those little tiny pig, she's like, that's not real. They're just, oh it's a baby pig. Gets a tiny little pig. It's just going to stay tiny. No, if you don't feed it, she'll stay tight.
