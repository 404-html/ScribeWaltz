Speaker 1:          00:00          But you don't ever work out boxing wise anymore. Yeah, but do you don't hit it. Hit a bag.

Speaker 2:          00:06          My son's 15 and I know he wants to buck so anytime we get a chance, you know I'm always training him.

Speaker 1:          00:13          How big is he now? Six feet. Jesus has told them the news. Tyson's son, Tyson son is 16 oh Miguel. Yeah. Tyson son was saying that he wants a box to Tyson's. Like listen, no, Miguel was not built like that. But he's also saying, listen you, you, you grew up soft and you know he's saying like, you don't want to meet someone like me. You know like the way he was. Yeah, I know Mike. I know you want to meet some animal like me. You know like when he was fighting like he like he thinks of what he would've done to his own son's like, oh don't do that. Like he was talking about it on the podcast and his son Miguel's Oh really talented kid. Like musician wise can play like seven different instruments. Wow. Spanish. Wow. The kid's really, and he's a really smart, nice kid.

Speaker 1:          00:57          Well, Tyson is a smart guy. He's not like he, I think people mistake tied. Some are big a dummy. He's very, very intelligent. Well read. Boxing is in at least some levels of very, very intellectual pursuit. There's, you have to have a strong mind to be able to dodge those punches, get in and get yours in that you have to, you have to be able to sort out that problem is a problem in front of you. The problem is another man who was the same way as you, the same size as you. He's got gloves on just like you do and he's trying to do what you're trying to do to him. And you have to do that within seconds. Boom. Yeah. Punches thrown at you. What do you do? What's, what's the rebuttal? Yeah. People don't understand. They think just because someone doesn't have the best vocabulary or because they don't have a, a comprehensive education that they're not intelligent and that's a big mistake.

Speaker 2:          01:45          No, twice Tyson's intelligence. Uh, I remember going to the Catskills when I was, uh, I won the world junior championships in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. And I remember the American team was saying, oh, well you never fought the best. I'm like, I didn't fight the best. I thought American sent them best team. Yeah. But one guy, he doesn't like taking plans and this manager don't like taking plans either. So I'm like, who's that? And they told me it was Mike Tyson custom model. So me and my trainer, we left Canada and we drove all the way up there and while we were up there raise the Roderick was up there and they said, oh, raising really came to inspire with us. So okay, I'll start with the, I'm here for four days. So first time Tyson actually met me, you know, he was Nice Guy, really nice guy, took me in his room, showed me some old flicks that I've never seen before of old time fighters would tell me about each fighter, like he studied them.

Speaker 2:          02:41          And then, um, you know, this is where he got his old star is his style of fighting from. And uh, first day in the first day in the gym bell when he came across and he was trying to kill me. Like, you know I did my Muhammad Ali thing obviously stayed away from his power, but the first day was really hectic and then the second day was a little hectic and it got better as it went along. And the last day is I got actually the better of him the last day and I remember custom models saying, Mike, you're going to meet him some day. Don't you do that? And not always echoed in my mind that will we ever fight? Will we have a fight? Cause cause the model said that we're going to fight. Why did it happen? And there's footage of it. Yeah. Wow. Lennox has the footage of it. Footage of the training centers. Barring how old was Tyson at the time? Tyson was like, uh, he was about 52. No, no. How old was he at the time? Oh, at the time. 15. Um, he was, he was younger than me. I was on Sunday. He's about 17. Wow. I was 18. He was younger than that. There must've been

Speaker 1:          03:49          fours before the, uh, empire state games and everything. Can you, would you want up there before you went to the 84 Olympics? Yeah. Yeah. Well, it must have been crazy though, knowing that, you know, you, you guys were going to be a part of boxing history and knowing that all the way back then and being a teenager and standing in front and here in custom model scream that out.

Speaker 2:          04:09          That must have been intense. It was intense because custom motto wasn't that loud when he was, when they, all of a sudden he became loud. It was like everybody listened, you know, and then, you know, there's certain ways that you would get across to people and some, some people take you have to shout at them. Did you ever wish that you fought him in his prime? Um, in essence I did fight him in his prime and you know, when you say prime, I was in my prime too. You know, you will

Speaker 1:          04:36          fleeing your prime. You were, you were, but I feel like his enthusiasm had waned before then. You know,

Speaker 2:          04:43          um, I, you know, this is my perception, how I look at that whole thing is Mike Tyson was an early bloomer. I was a late bloomer. So, you know, when, when both of us meet, you know, there's never a perfect time. Perfect time for us is when we meet in the middle. Right, right, right. And, you know,

Speaker 1:          05:02          right. And if he won, maybe people would look at it differently. Right. This, because you beat him and beat him so soundly that people look at it like maybe his, his time had already been gone. Yeah. Lenox turned pro after Mike had already had a defeat. Wow. No claims turn pro and 89. Wow. I never even thought of that. And Mike lost in January. Right?

Speaker 2:          05:20          Yeah. This is us open up. Look at

Speaker 1:          05:23          you. Look at Kevin Rooney. Wow. That is crazy, man. God, that's crazy built back then too. We had a big neck. Yeah. He, well, he was always doing those neck bridges. He, but he also just had freak genetics. I mean, just phenomenal genetic specimen, you know. Uh, I had um, uh, Teddy Atlas in here and Teddy House used to take Mike to the smokers when he was 13. And Teddy was joking around about it, said everybody always lied about how old people were. They would tell you the kid was 16, when really it was 20. They always did that and he said, uh, he goes, uh, so, uh, how old is this kid? He was 13. He goes, what does he weigh? He goes, 190 pounds. It's like, what the fuck teddy, come on. He's like, I'm telling Ya, he's sick. He's fucking 13. What do you want?

Speaker 1:          06:07          So, you know, nobody would believe it because he was such a specimen. I watched that one. Teddy was great man. Do you think he should have stayed with teddy? Should have stayed with Kevin and Teddy? Well he definitely, you know, he was so wild. Like how, how could you tell him what to do back then? That was part of the problem. I mean, he was never, no one ever prepared him. And this is one of the things that we discussed on the podcast was that he was a 12 year old, 13 year old boy and he was getting hypnotized. He had came from a terrible background. It was, there was no love, he was abandoned and all of a sudden he's getting love and attention for something. And this one thing was this man who was telling him, you're going to be a great fight or you're going to be a world champion.

Speaker 1:          06:47          And he would hypnotize me saying, you don't exist. The task exists. You know you're going to work the body and destroy this man. And he would tell he would put these thoughts in his head and Mike couldn't wait to just get out there and fuck people up. Cause that's where he got the love. That's where he got the attention from. But he never turned, never told them how to shut it off. He never, I mean he didn't have time to work with him cause he was, he was on his way out and he was dying when he met Mike. And so he only taught them how to destroy. He never taught them how to cope. He never taught them how to understand that there's going to be a lot of shit coming your way and you've got to know what that is and don't get caught up in that hype train.

Speaker 1:          07:21          Don't just don't get wrapped up in Hollywood. And you know, he wound up marrying robbin Gibbons and you know, all, I don't think cus foresaw all that other bullshit. No. How could he of course was around Mike would be totally different. He would have been a different man if costs lasted another 15 years given if Jimmy Jacobs had lasted another five years, maybe. Yeah, maybe it would have helped. But I mean it's like once you're once removed from cus, it's like Kevin Rooney was once removed from costs. Right. And then Teddy Atlas was way more of a hard liner. You know, Teddy Atlas, you couldn't put any bullshit with, you know, and like those other guys who just got to go, ah, you know, when he got to Aaron's snowball and all those guys was with them, bums reaching Ghia Ketty they just didn't, they, they didn't. They could have never brought Mike to the dance. Right. They got there when he was already at the dance and they just trying to like maintain things and he's not listening to anybody. They also weren't boxing people as far as I was concerned

Speaker 2:          08:13          when he was up with costs use. It was in a good situation. You know, there was a lady in the house cooking meals. Uh, they had custody of being a father figure, talk to him every day. And that's what young kids need. They need that, you know, to be spoken with by older people. Yeah. And you know, a lot of young people nowadays are not even respecting the older people, but they can get in a lot of information from an older person. You know, how do you deal with this situation? Well, you know, you hear it from an older person that kind of makes your mind thinking, said, you know, you're right. It works for them. So anytime I get a chance to talk to kids about, you know, their life and where they're going or it's take that opportunity.
