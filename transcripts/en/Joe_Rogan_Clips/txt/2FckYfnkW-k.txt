Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah, it's gonna be tough for him. Well, they were trying to get him, um, he was trying to get the Conor McGregor fight. That had been a tough fight for him. It would've been a tough fight for him. But at 155 pounds is not a bad fight for him. No, not really. But I mean, the problem is stylistically he just does, he doesn't move his head enough. Yeah. You know, and Nate, I mean, Nate doesn't either, but Nate took a lot of shots, you know, to the hit. So I mean, it's kind of a bad, I don't know. Yeah. But Nate, Nate is a, Nate is a very good boxer. Yeah. Make a box. Nate Diaz is, it frustrates the shit out of me that he's not fighting. Why is that? Because I like to see him. I want to see him get in there. I want to see him make money while he can too.

Speaker 1:          00:43          I mean you're only going to be able to live this lifestyle for, I mean, I know he made a couple of million dollars off of the Conor fight, but he hasn't fought in two years more than handling and else like put the dust employee a fight that was going to happen, but then Poria got injured, he's got some hip issue and then he pulled out of that fight. I just, I was looking forward to that fight. I want to, I want to see him back in it. Yeah. But I mean I would've loved to seen that fight and then never supposed to find Mazda doll. That's, that's not going to happen. Oh, why? I Dunno. That's the perfect fight. Great fight the fight. Where you going to got like the Hispanic culture, the civil war and that's fine. Yola going at it. Yeah. That would have been a great stylist and like they would have talked trash to each other.

Speaker 1:          01:27          It would have been crazy. Whoever dropped the ball on that needs to be fired. I think nick just decided not fight. I don't know. I do not know. I don't know. I'm talking out of my ass. I don't know the specifics, but I was looking forward to it. But then I saw an article that said Nate, Nick Diaz confirms he's not going to be fighting in the UFC to 35 I'm like, what? What? Get in there. Oh come on man. Last time we fought was Anderson Silva. That's crazy. That is crazy. That's crazy. But I don't know. I mean I don't know Joe. And this is something that we kind of kind of stopped doing man. Like maybe they ain't got it no more. Well I don't know if it's, he doesn't have it anymore because we haven't seen him. Not Habit. He fought well against Anderson Anderson's 185 pounder.

Speaker 1:          02:13          I wouldn't lead down. Yay. I mean, I mean, I mean honestly if anybody could still fight in her old age to weigh those Dib, Diaz brothers fight their style will allow them to fight longer cause they're not like the best athletes. So they were not I own skill and just endurance. Endurance. Yeah. So they can fight longer. So I'm assuming that they still have something left in the tank. I'm sure. I mean, they're obviously not out of shape. They're both things. Yeah, they look like their fit. I see them training, I see pictures of them with Jujitsu gies on and hitting the bag and shit. This, you know, who knows man. I mean it's also like they want that big payday, you know? Especially now, and they should get that big payday. But goddamn, if I was the UFC, if I am fuck yeah, I think those guys are superstars.

Speaker 1:          03:02          I think the UFC doesn't know. I think one of the reasons why Nate Diaz versus Conor McGregor was so big is because people love Nate Diaz to Yay Conor McGregor. No doubt Conor Mcgregor, no disrespect to Eddie Alvarez. But when Conor McGregor fight Eddie Alvarez, the vast majority of the eyes were on Conor McGregor. When Conor McGregor fights Nate Diaz, you, you're looking at a lot of people who love Nate Diaz. Yeah. But how do you think that happened? Like how do you think Nate got that says that star power, you think he legitimately doesn't give a fuck? He smokes weed all the time. People love it. They love the fact that those guys are like that. No Man. But what does that say about our fan base and our society? Well, I don't know. You know, what does the, here's what's disappointing to me, that for whatever reason, mighty mouse never became a giant superstar. Yeah. That confused the shit out of me.

Speaker 1:          03:55          I'd watch that guy fight, you know, when he took Ray Borg and suplex him and caught him with an arm bar on the way down and was like, what the fuck does this guy have to do to become a superstar? I mean, his skill levels off the chart for sure. It doesn't get hit for sure and put it on, he's a dazzling fighter. Puts, puts on show skill for skill. There's nobody on the planet who can do what he does now. He's the best ever. He's the best physically ever. Yeah. When the only thing that keeps him from being thought of as universally the greatest of all time is Jon Jones and Jon Jones been able to beat better guys.
