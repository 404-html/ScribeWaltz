Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. So what is the corporation about the corporations? The story of the Cuban American organized crime organization that began in the mid 1960s and existed all the way to the end of the century. And it was led by this mobster named Jose Miguel battle, who was kind of a legendary figure in Cuban American circles because he was a hero from the Bay of Pigs invasion, the a and the attempt to reclaim Cuba take back Cuba, the invasion, 1961 which was a disaster for everyone involved, battle wound up in prison along with the rest of the brigade. And when he got out and came back to the u s he was determined to get Castro and take back Cuba. So he set up this criminal thing and it was based on a one racket, primarily Bolita the number, the lottery, the illegal lottery for the lottery was illegal. It was illegal, and it was controlled by organized crime.

Speaker 1:          01:03          And it was a huge moneymaker, big moneymaker for the mob. Going back to the 1920s everyone bets the number, a little old ladies, but the number of priests, cops, you know, you can bet a nickel, you can bet a dime. You can bet $10,000 hugely profitable for whoever controls and organizes it. Well the Cubans controlled and organized it on the eastern coast of the United States from New Jersey and New York all the way down to Miami. And the guy who controlled it was battle and he became legendary based on that. They controlled the whole number system. Cause I know there's a lot of Italians that were, well they went, they went to the Mafia. One of the first things battle did battle had been a cop of vice cop in Havana in the 1950s during the, for the turnover. Yeah, during the era when the mob of Joey was talking about Havana Nocturne.

Speaker 1:          01:52          That's what that book was about. The era of the mob in a van in the fifties Meyer Lansky Santo traffic content and how they controlled that until Castro came along and spoiled the party and the revolution happened and they got chased out of their battle. Had been a vice cop in Havana during those years and he knew all those uh, high ranking mobsters. And in fact he was a bag man who delivered money from the Skimm at the casinos in Havana to the presidential palace. So battle knew how the world went round and he made those connections. And when he finally gets to the U S and wants to start his own thing, first thing he does is go to Santo traffic. Content says, can you make the proper introductions from me? Profit content introduces him to fat Tony Salerno in New York City who controls the numbers are accurate for all five families. And battle says, look, things are changing in Cuba over the next couple of decades. You're going to have tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of Cubans coming to live in the United States. They all bet the number. That's a huge market. If you let me take over this

Speaker 2:          03:00          thing and organize it, you will get a piece of, you will get your piece of everything. And the Mafia said yes. And so the Cubans took over and they control everything. I mean in New York City in the seventies and eighties, there were probably 200 to 300 Belita spots where you could go bet the number. That's what the Cubans called the Bolita, a little ball. And uh, so they controlled it and they took care of the mafia and everybody was got fat and happy, uh, for awhile until it turned bad and they started killing each other. Now when Joey, when you heard about this book, this is something that you were very intimately involved in when you were a kid. Very, you know, I come on your show and I'll tell you there's a hundred stories I could tell you there's a thousand I can. And when he told, when I read the thesis for this book, I just knew, I just fucking know.

Speaker 2:          03:53          You know, I grew up in numbers when I went to Catholic school on of, and I'm like, I came home on Fridays and Saturdays at the age of Eight, I was sent to different locations in the city, the Bronx, Brooklyn, and I would make $50 going to run errands, run the numbers. They'll tell this guy the first number of the day is to, you know, so I grew up in it. I grew up in a house where the bookie would call my mother by three o'clock and go, what's the numbers for the day? And My mother would give him a fucking laundry list, you know? And uh, it's very interesting in this book, He also covers the mysticism of the number. So if I'm at your house and your daughter walks in with a hockey shirt and a number is 13, I'll look at you and go, Joe, give me a number from zero to nine five and I pick up the phone.

Speaker 2:          04:42          I bet five 13. If I look out my window and the cop car is five Oh six, I put $5 on five oh six. If I have a dream about an eagle, when I go down to the Bolita spot, there's books that they sell books or dreams. And I take that book and I look up Eagle. And if eagles number eight, I pay eight 13. It's, you know, you were mentioning a couple months ago that your grandmother took numbers. Grandmother was Sicilian. Sicilian people have the same, uh, every day they live. Today's the day. Today's the day Joe Rogan. Yup. I, the day I'm hitting the number, I'm not getting you. She talked about that dream. That dream would. Again, we're going back on immigrant mentality, those street numbers today. If God wants, if God is real well, he says it's true. My number's gonna to come out to that one is my ship. Got to come in that work. You work a plain Jane Dream. You wrote, you were a blue collar person and I'm the way home every day. By three 30, you put the number and that's it. That's what you do and to believe in. That's something I can relieve. Yeah. Numerology. And with Cubans, uh, it was very

Speaker 1:          05:58          mystical. It was tied into a dreams and belief. The idea was you bet the number and you try to make your dreams come true. That's literally what you're doing. You're trying to make your dreams come true. And the bullied the guys, the bully terros the ones who control it there, the dream makers, they're the guys who are making it possible. For your dreams to come true. So they had tremendous stature in the

Speaker 2:          06:21          Munich minimum, every dream Saba. So you work the tjs Jose Battle and you're an independent bookie. Your job is to sit at, at bring the lounge and Westlink 10th to three drinking and all day long people come in and go, Joe gimme, five 17 $3, give me three Oh three one doll at three o'clock, three 30 a number comes up. If that number wins, if I can give you 500 you get 3000 from battle, you give me 2,500 so you make 500 off the top. And then I tip. Yet, the thing that battled did was he didn't take 10 points. He let you run your independent action unless you called it in to him. You know, it's very, you're watched the movie, uh, uh, what smooth Mickey Rourke and the these people, you're the dragon. That fucking movie, great movie. When he says, you know, for years the Chinese will bring it into heroin and they were sending it to the Italians, you know, a $50,000 investment. It can make you $500,000 Chinese weren't saying that like they weren't seeing that. Why? Because they didn't have, they couldn't bring it out. They couldn't sell it. Black people and Spanish people bitch slap them to that, so the same thing happened with Bolita fat. Tony Salerno knew that he had a big thing coming with the Cubans. The Cubans want to put a better with Cubans. Yeah, they understand the Italians. They want to put a bet on where the Italians, Puerto Ricans, they want to put a better than with a Puerto Rican.

Speaker 1:          07:56          It's not a big thing. That was with the numbers. It was that there was a community thing. It's a community that actually would talk about the numbers and be like the lottery is some sort of a government funded gang and it seems like it's got a lot of red tape and official and there's no wiggle room. The numbers seem to be closer to like the community, especially with Latinos, especially with [inaudible]. It was the, in some ways the core of the community, the number of spots where everybody would hang out. You'd go to hear the neighborhood Lobola in like the, the gossip and the streets. He'd go there and here in the neighborhood, guys up. Uh, yeah, it was an end. It was never meant to be violent. Back in Cuba. Belita was not violent. It was illegal, but it wasn't violent and it turned very violent than you in the United States to corporation became so profitable.

Speaker 1:          08:48          I mean, we're talking about millions of dollars on a monthly basis, billions of dollars over course of the life of this organization. Billions of dollars more than they could. The artist thing they had was what to do with the money. I mean, they, they, they would literally strap money to people to as money couriers to try to get it out of the country to get it into getting into offshore bank accounts and launder the money. They had more money than they know it was a license to print money, which hugely profitable. That's what made it violence. Then you started having gangsters vying for territory, territorial disputes, greed, greed took over and it got very ugly. And there was this, this between Cubans, between Cubans, between the Cubans and the Italians. See, this guy battle was very charismatic leader, uh, with some great leadership qualities. He'd been a hero in the Bay of Pigs invasion.

Speaker 1:          09:45          He saved some guys lives. Um, when I first heard that story, I didn't, I said, I got to verify that maybe this is just the story I told about himself to burnish his legend. So I found the guys that he saved and I found the guys, two brothers who went with him to save that the guys that he saved. And I went to Cuba, to the Bay of pigs, to the exact location where he saved these guys to verify this story. And it was absolutely true. He, in a, an act of incredible heroism. He saved the life of a number of his platoon members. And so that was his reputation. From then on, he was revered in the community. He was a hero and people defended him even, even when it, it turned ugly and he became a ruthless boss who was killing people left and right.

Speaker 1:          10:36          He had his defenders because of his legend as a hero in the community. And so, um, the power that he had. But he also had this, uh, Joey and I were talking about this tube and tab this Latinos have this, everybody has it, but Cubans have it a desire for revenge. This guy, you know, the Bay of Pigs invasion was an attempt that revenge to get revenge against Castro. And they were humiliated by that process. And a lot of the guys from that generation had an unfinished agenda for revenge. So if you wrong this guy battle in any way, he was going to get you, even if it took years and years of calculation. I mean, there's stories in the book about this one guy who killed his brother named Pilou. He took, it took nine years and 12 attempts before they finally killed this guy, Paul Lula.

Speaker 1:          11:31          They shot him in his hospital. He was in the hospital. They shot him how to assassinate dressed up as a male nurse and go into the hospital and shoot him between the eyes because there had been so many failed attempts, they weren't going to fail this time. And that's in battle to 12 years. I mean, took nine years. His awesome. No, never caught him. No, no way. Bank disappeared. I believe the assassin got killed later cause he was talking about it having done it and so battle had him killed. Wow. Yeah. So the, the revenge motive, the revenge motive, um, kind of trove battle off the deep end. And uh, somewhere along the line he broke bad, so to speak. I mean, I don't know if he was ever good and had to break bad, but he started doing internal killings. It really had nothing to do about business. They were all about revenge. Well, this is a theme that happens a lot with organized crime people. Right? It's like they just get a taste of killing people and it becomes easier and easier. And then they, that was the thing about murder machine, right? About Roy Demeo, right? Yeah. You just can't, was killing people and nothing to it after awhile. And that's another book you gave me. Yeah. I was reading all those books on the road.

Speaker 3:          12:48          Okay. Okay.
