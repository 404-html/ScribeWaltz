Speaker 1:          00:00          Her low freak bitches. So, um, your podcast. Yeah. Was the big podcasts that kind of Sunk Milo. It's kind of a combination of Mama and yours. And I remember it was years, it was me watching him on your show that led us to ask about that because I saw him on your show and he was like God at the time. Cause I remember at the time he was on our show, uh, I told Paul, one of my cohosts like Paul, this guy ain't no lightweight and he's got a huge army of sycophants right now. If you get in a debate with him, if you lose, you're a total bitch. If you tie, you lose. If you win by a little, you lose. The only way you can actually beat him with his army of sycophants at this time is if you just demolish him. So don't even try.

Speaker 1:          00:50          You were concerned about this, like this is like something you planned out in advance. No, I mean I wasn't really, it wasn't really a plan. I just wanted to bring it up cause I saw him on your show saying and I'm like, that's very strange. I kind of knew where he was coming from. Sure. Cause I knew that he had had experiences, like sexual experiences when he was younger and he was kind of, I think he was trying to trivialize them and turn them into humor. Yeah. I mean, you know, his way of dealing with it or whatever. Um, you know, say like I owe me and it was mutual between me and the priest. I was molested by a priest, but I was into it. So it was cool. He was like, I was the predator. Yeah. Like he said, Deuce the priest, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:30          Yeah. It's kind of hard for me to imagine a 13 year old boy, no matter how flamboyantly gay or sexually aggressive, uh, you know, jumping the priest bones or something, you know. Well I think it, it sort of gives you a better understanding of how this guy came to be, who he is today and why he's so relishes this role of being the contrarian and being this, uh, this sort of very difficult to pigeonhole gay man who's very conservative but yet believes in man. Boy Love. This is a, if you go back and you read old articles that he wrote for publications that he worked for in the past, um, there was a lot of stuff like we're going to take on bullying on Twitter and you know, we need to make a safe space for people online. This is Milo and now, yeah, he's like the biggest troll.

Speaker 1:          02:29          Right? Uh, I mean we talked about Milo last time. Uh, I was on your show and you told me you kind of put the seed in my brain, like [inaudible] kind, Kinda like fake. And the more I've looked into it, the more I have to question whether or not that shit with the priest even happens to begin with. Yeah. Because I just don't, I don't know. I don't really trust the shit that comes out of his mouth in terms of like face value. Right. And I think a lot of times when Milo tries to make a point, um, he doesn't necessarily make it by directly saying it. He tries to make it through uh, like performance art. Like when he went on Bill Maher and um, and you know, he, he's, he's doing this whole flamboyant gay conservative thing because he wants the, the Liberal Bill Maher audience to be like boom, boom.

Speaker 1:          03:17          Cause it's like, oh look what hypocrites. They say they accept gays, but the second you don't tow their line, what they obviously like is people who told their line, not gay people. Uh, I think that was the point he was trying to make. I thought it was funny too, how Bill Maher the next day after my low scandal broke was like I took him down. It was me. It was his hand. Yeah. It's like I took, I took them down. It's like, dude, you compare it. You said he was the next Hitchens when he was on your shit. He really said he told him to. I said, I took him down. No, I took him down. He's a fool. That's such a foolish thing to think. I don't, I, you know what I think is what Milo does, a lot of it is performance art. Yeah. It's a lot of trolling and it's a lot of very calculated stuff designed to sort of rile people up and get people active and get people to talk about him.

Speaker 1:          04:06          I mean, that's the reason why he does this tour on colleges. I mean, why wilds? Why not do it in the lion's den if you want to get the roars? I mean, he's doing it like where he feels like this problem is the greatest. Oh, he wants to stir that pot too because he knows if he just does it and some club downtown, there's not going to be any protest and we're going to give a shit. It's still protest, I'm sure, but not like bringing it to their camp. It won't be like what happened at Berkeley? Yes. Yeah. What happened at Berkeley? It was just fucking insane. It's really insane. Is that, was it the mayor of San Francisco? That was applauding the protests like, hey, fuck face. There was $100,000 worth of property damage. People throwing chairs. There's Starbucks windows and light and cop cars on fire like this.

Speaker 1:          04:44          This ain't good. There's been articles on like the Huffington, I almost made a video about this article on the Huffington post actually, that was basically like, um, violence is as valid or reaction to Trump as anything. And it's like, wow, you're literally just advocating for violence. Uh, and you think you're so enlightened. Yeah. It's completely foolish. It's like, it goes in once things aren't going their way. It goes against everything they've stood before. Before. What about kindness? What about compassion? What about treating people with love? What about facts? Well, that's okay. When they're in power. Exactly. That's okay when they're in power, but when someone else empowered that they don't like it all kind of goes up. Look, kind of goes both ways though, doesn't it? Oh yeah, definitely.
