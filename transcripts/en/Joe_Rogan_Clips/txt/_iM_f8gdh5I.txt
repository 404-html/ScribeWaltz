Speaker 1:          00:00          I'm to learn about economics and to understand, you know, the source of the problems because anybody could just blame it on some rich person who's hoarding money and discriminating against them. They love doing that. And then just say, oh, this solution. See if you blame the problems on some rich person. Well the solution is easy. Just take his money, right, have the government come in and, and redistribute the wealth. The W, which is another word for steel. Take money from somebody who earned it and give it to somebody who didn't. But if you actually take a little bit of time and use your head instead of your, your, your, your, your heart, your feelings, uh, you'll learn that you know, that the source of the problems is government interference in the economy and that the protest should be directed at government, at their regulations and their subsidies and their taxes and all of the things that government does to stifle economic growth and deny opportunities to people.

Speaker 2:          00:55          D W I think there would be a really funny documentary if you could do like a documentary on the last occupier, like the last person to occupy Wall Street because it had to be like stragglers, right. Eventually must've gotten to the point where there's like 30 people left, 20 people left, they one guy now fuck these people man.

Speaker 1:          01:15          You know, they started occupying different areas, right? Cause it caught on and it was all over the world they were occupying here and occupying their, and they were setting up camps. Right. They're essentially living there. Yeah. Yeah. And who knows what else they were doing there. But um, but now the occupied more a movement kind of morphed into the Bernie Sanders Movement, right? Because that's where all those guys are now. They were volunteering for the Sanders campaign and, and socialism is really kind of going mainstream now because they put the word Democrat in front of it as if somehow that changes the meeting. Right. I'm not a socialist. I'm a democratic socialist. Meaning I want to vote for socialism as opposed to just have, you know, an armed revolution. But the end is still the same. Right? It's still a socialism and it's, it doesn't work. Yeah. It was watching an interview with Tucker Carlson

Speaker 2:          02:00          and some guy's a professor at Harvard and uh, he said, I'll give you the last word. He guys said, socialism is going to win. Thank you. I made the piece. I'm like, what is that? What does that even mean? Like socialism is going to win. What is it? What does that mean? What is socialism? Well, it could win at the polls. That's the

Speaker 1:          02:16          problem. It's very intoxicating to people who don't know any better. Right? And the interesting thing, people, they have too much money. The interesting thing about socialism is that no matter how many times it fails, people expect it to succeed, right? That's the definition of insanity, right? Doing something over and over again and expecting a different result. Well, the Socialists always expect a different result from doing something that has never succeeded in the past.

Speaker 2:          02:41          Socialism by definition is one thing, but by the emotional reaction to people have is kind of another thing. The emotional reaction is there's rich people that are a real problem. They're hoarding their greedy. I'm not concerned with money. I want, I'm concerned with people and community and feelings and health and welfare and education and all that money. We should take it from those rich people and we should funnel it into education and community. And they say all these words that make people feel good. Like, yeah, we're not about money either.

Speaker 1:          03:12          It's all, it's all about feeling good. That's what the liberals are about. It's about, you know, feeling that they're better than everybody else because they're, you know, they're, they're higher up on this moral pedestal because they don't care about money. They just care about, you know, people and you know. But when you talk about rich people, they don't hoard money. I mean, the way you get rich is not by hoarding. The way you get rich is by trying to figure out what problems people have that you can solve, right? Whether it's inventing something that makes their lives better or providing a service that makes their lives better because the customers are in charge individuals, right? That that's what's going to allocate wealth. It's if, if somebody is better than somebody else at satisfying the desires that people have, right? If, if I can come up with something that you like, that you want to buy that's cheaper and better than what somebody else has come up with, then you're going to buy from me.

Speaker 1:          04:05          And so the person who ends up with the most money is the person who's satisfied, the most desires, the most needs in the most efficient way possible. And, and that's what's benefiting society. I mean, it's great to have charity and I'm all for private charity, but if you look at the wealthiest men in history, even though they've been incredible philanthropist and they've given away a lot of money, they helped a lot more people, a massing their fortunes than gifting away. What they made it was the businesses that they created, the, the, the products that they invented, the services that they provided and the employment, right? That was all a function of they're creating their wealth. That's what did a lot more to help society than simply giving away some of the money that they earned. Have you ever had a debate with a democratic socialist?

Speaker 1:          04:52          Well, I mean, most Democrats are socialists. They just don't know it or they don't want to admit it. I and a lot of people don't even understand what socialism is because you know you'll have the left. I'll always consider somebody like even Donald Trump, they'll say, oh, he's a fascist, right? They don't even realize that fascism is part of socialism. Socialism is a broad concept that includes things like Communism and fascism. So if you're a communist, you are a socialist. But by, but it doesn't mean that if you're a socialist, you're a communist because you could be a fascist, you could be for a lot of things, but fascism is a form of socialism where the government doesn't just steal all the property, like the communist want to nationalize everything and take legal ownership of the means of production. Right? The government just owns all the capital under.

Speaker 1:          05:38          Under fascism, the government is a little bit smarter. They realize that people will work harder if they think they're working for themselves. So the fastest doesn't want to nationalize businesses. They just want to control it through regulation and taxes. And that's pretty much what the Democrats want to do. They want to control everything by taxing it heavily and regulating it. And those, that's an important aspect of fascist. I mean, a lot of people associate fascism with racism just because the Nazis were, were racist, but you don't have to be racist. I mean, fascism started in Italy and that there wasn't any racism there. And if you go back to, uh, the Nazi party, it's the National Socialist Party of Germany. That's what the Nazis are. It's socialists. So fascism is a form of socialism. That's why the communists and the fascists, you know, argue so much because they're really, they're fighting over the same turf. It's which brand of socialism is better, fascism or communism, but they're not at opposite ends of the political spectrum. They're on the same end.
