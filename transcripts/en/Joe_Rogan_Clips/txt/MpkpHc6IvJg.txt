Speaker 1:          00:00          I see, I see. Jeff is like beyond unique. Like there's nobody like him. And what he does and what he is able to do is really, it's really, it's not only fun to watch, but it's really like, you know, you're a self starter. He's a self starter. Like it's great to see self starters who find success because it really is difficult to like take something and like make it not only financially successful but also like something that, that we all respect and love. You know? And that's, you know, I'd say the roasting thing that Jeff really pretty much has rebranded into like, you know, every, every, every possible way you can do it is always good because he's behind it, you know, when it's not, when it's not really with him then and you're like, I'm not so sure. There's other people who are really good at it too. But I'm just saying that like, you know, that is when, you know, we're on the road and people will scream out the car door. It's the roast master. I mean like, you know, I had my insomniac time but he like 2030 times that in terms of like recognition, I mean it's just amazing.

Speaker 2:          00:57          It is. Where the year you're synonymous with roasts. Yeah. You know, I mean like people say roasts, they think Jeff Ross, I earned it because wouldn't people laughed at me and thought, oh that's a dead art. It's a lost art. It's antiquated. It's Corny. It's old guys. I stuck by it and said, no, it's alternative comedy. No one's doing it. I get to, I get to hang with legends like Buddy Hackett and Milton Berle, you know, and I stuck to it because, and there was a watch, there was a, there was a time where I was like embarrassed. Like, Oh, I'm going to be pigeonholed as the roast guy. Were you embarrassed? Not Him. I don't know if embarrassed is the right word, but comfortable. Yeah. Cause you're like, well I want to be more than that. You know, when was this around? This is probably 10 years ago and I was in Vegas, Chappelle. Again, words of wisdom. He's like, dude, that's your lane. Make that a five lane highway and ride it. And that's kind of what we started, what I started doing, sort of really owning it and loving it and to the credit of the world as we became more pussies in the world, like roasting became more and more potent and important. Yeah. And the world needs to develop thick skin, and I think roasting honors people, and it's done with love, but it also kind of toughens us up a little bit.
