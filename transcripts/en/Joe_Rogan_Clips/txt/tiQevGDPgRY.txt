Speaker 1:          00:00          I mean you, I have friends that are pretty overweight and one that died pretty recently who was really big and he just had this feeling when he would meet people. I mean you talked about it a little bit. It was just obese, you know, it was just this thing where you're just, Oh, look at this enormous fat guy. And then to go from that to, oh, there's a guy, there's a normal guy that's just a guy that's 168 pound guy. Normal. No difference between Hannah. I tell Ya, I know we, we love to, we love to beat up on fat people. We love to turn it into a character defect. But I gotta tell you virtually every fat person that I know or that I've taken care of, they are not disproportionally eating more than their peers. So in some cases, yes, but not on balance it, the problem is that they simply do everything incorrectly, metabolically, you know, so their body is functioning correctly and it's, you know, and it's exempt.

Speaker 1:          00:58          There's a genetic component. I think there are dietary exacerbations. I think certainly not exercising makes things worse. So there are lots of predisposing factors, but at the end of the day, what's happening is when you and I eat like let's, let's take a meal that, that like if you had pancakes, bacon and scrambled eggs, that would be like a really good mix of, that'd be a third carbs, a third protein, a third fat. So that's like a shit ton of nutrient, right? If you were, I ate that. Yeah, it probably wouldn't be that good for us. But like we, you know, let's say we just finished a workout or something like we're going to partition such that that glycogen will first and foremost go to replace the muscle and liver stores of glycogen because we have bigger muscles and our muscles are more insulin sensitive. We can actually disproportionately put more glycogen into our muscles, into the leg muscles, cause you'll have done that, run up the hills.

Speaker 1:          01:44          Right. And, and then furthermore, when we want to recruit energy again, we'll have the ability to actually go back and get fat. Especially, you know, in other words, break down fat at lower ATP demands than necessarily always going to glycogen. So, in other words, we partition fuel in a smarter way. And these patients, I mean you can measure this clinically using something called rer and of course doing other blood tests, like they just, they just, they can't break down their own fat. So their body is essentially broken in that regard. And that can be fixed with, with diet. It's a hard problem because the way I explained it to people as, and so clinically I'm not interested in weight loss, right? I mean that's just not, I'm much more interested in longevity and yeah, sometimes weight loss comes with that. But I like if I ever get stuck doing, you know, weight loss, like I'll, I'll, I'm doing the wrong thing for my interest.

Speaker 1:          02:36          But, um, the way I say to people when they want to lose weight is, look, you don't want to lose weight. You want to lose fat. Let's, let's be very clear on our semantics. It weight is irrelevant, right? Unless you're a cyclist or some athlete for whom the actual scale means something. But for, for people like us, it's you want to lose fat, not wait. And then when you say you want to lose fat, what does that mean in English? Well, do you want fewer fat cells or do you want each fat cell to be smaller? Those are totally different questions. If you want fewer fat cells have liposuction, but we know that that doesn't fix you metabolically. So if you want fewer, if you want to be less fat, you have to have smaller fat cells. Now, a fat cell conceptually has two inputs and one output.

Speaker 1:          03:17          So now I say, let's reframe the question. You've got a room with a hundred people in it. You want fewer people in the room. What has to happen? More people have to leave the room, then enter the room. So similarly, if you have a fat cell and you want it to be less fat, you've got to get more fat out of it. Then enters it and the fat that exits the cell exits via a process called lipolysis and the inputs to a fat cell or something called De Novo Lipogenesis, which is turning carbohydrates into fat and reassess aerification, which is turning fat like in a free fatty acid into a triglyceride back into a fat cell. Each of those three doors is controlled by hormones. And so the purpose of nutrition or fasting or exercise or drugs or hormones or all these things is to manipulate those hormones in the direction of what I call negative fat flux or what would be referred to in the literature as fat balance, negative fat balance.

Speaker 1:          04:09          And the hormones that drive that are are many insulin, hormone sensitive lipase, testosterone, estrogen, cortisol being the five most important in my opinion. Uh, maybe someone will disagree with that, but I think those are the five that rule the roost. And so, you know, how do you manipulate those? Well, insulin seems to be the most important of the five and there's no better way to lower insulin than to not eat. So the first thing that happened to that dude who went 382 days without anything but water and minerals, is he basically had very low insulin levels. In fact, once he got into raging Ketosis, which he got into by about day seven, his insulin came up only to prevent him from going into Ketoacidosis, which was what would happen if he had no insulin response. In other words, if he was a type one diabetic, he would have died if ketoacidosis, because he wouldn't have had the insulin to regulate the uptick of ketones.

Speaker 1:          05:04          But if you are, I did this because we have a normal pancreas. We would actually remake just enough insulin to suppress ketogenesis and keep that Beta hydroxybutyrate level in the, you know, kind of in the neighborhood of probably seven or eight millimolar as opposed to getting north of 12 to 15 which is when you get into trouble. So you know, how do you manipulate insulin? Nutrition is the first way. If you can't fast, the next best thing is to reduce carbohydrates. Carbohydrates obviously are the most insulinogenic of food, although protein can be quite insular agentic as well. It has a different response. Um, and then that's when you start to think about these other things. You know, I've seen patients where they just can't lose weight and I watch what they're doing and they're doing everything right, but they just can't lose weight. But then you notice their cortisol levels through the roof.

Speaker 1:          05:54          It's hard to get rid of fat when you have hot lots of cortisol. Cortisol is a very anabolic hormone to fat in a very catabolic hormone to muscle, which is the exact opposite of what we want to stoss. Drone, of course is the exact opposite. Testosterone is catabolic to fat but anabolic to muscle. Um, and then of course, you know, women have a harder time because once women go through menopause, they lose all the estrogen and all the testosterone. And so now they lose two hormones that play a very important role in regulating this. So for these people that are having the issue with cortisol levels, that's exacerbated by stress, right? So stress actually exacerbates your weight gain. Absolutely. That's interesting. In addition to a whole bunch of other stuff, literally eat the same diet and gain more weight because of stress. Absolutely. Wow. Again, hormones are what's driving fuel partitioning. You know, you're responsible for what you put in your mouth, but in many ways, at that point, like the hormones take over and decide where it's going. Wow.
