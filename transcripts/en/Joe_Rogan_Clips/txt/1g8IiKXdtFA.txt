Speaker 1:          00:00          Started as a test. Jane Fonda workouts though. Jane Fonda back in the day with the doggy thing. What was that like? 1970s seven to me. Damn. Oh, that was crazy. That was so fucking big. It was the first time women were marketed to for exercise. Think so. I think so. I think before that women may be competed in athletic events like gymnastics and shit like that when they were young, but then when they probably got families or moved on to jobs, they probably stopped. What is this one? Just go aerobic championship. Oh my God. Look at this as a choreographed dance. This is so strange. Wow, that's right. Do you remember aerobics really quick? I'm going to take an aerobics class. Yeah, you remember that? I'll be kind of, that was people would just dance around and you would do stuff. Feel the pump, pop the pop and two and three and go.

Speaker 1:          00:57          They turn. Everybody gave for about five years, but it, all these guys, look at these guys. These guys are straight as fuck and they don't even know they're doing gay stuff. You know? It's like, it's like when, before everybody knew that Rob Halford from Judas priest is gay. He used to make everybody dress up like him because everybody like the kids that were straight kids, so we're huge fans of Judas priest. They would wear the cap and the j wearing gay aesthetic like gay biker looking right. Tough guys. Everybody got into it because they loved him because Judas, it is so bad ass and he's such a fucking awesome front man that like he had straight guys dressing up like a gay bike. That's fucking hilarious. And then he comes out and they're all, they're like, what? This so confused. But he did it in a concert.

Speaker 1:          01:46          Does 100,000. No, I'm just saying what if he did and they looked down and there were y'all wearing is what I like in my men. I had him on a show I did once. It was a like this um, thing for VH one called the list. Oh yeah, I did that. You did it too? Yeah. Here he is. Look at that. I mean look at the outfit Bro. Seriously. Wow. The leather paper boy hat on. Yeah, well it's more like a soldier's hat and he's got leather vest on with no shirt underneath. Leather gloves. It's spikes all SNM shit. Tight, tight, tight leather pants. It's hilarious.

Speaker 1:          02:25          Freddie Mercury. Yeah man. Um, what was my point? What we're, we're, we're talking about something right before we were talking about that. Oh, the, the, the rubiks. The aerobics guys. Like, come on man. They had dudes were in singles. Look at this. Look at this outfit. This, that's like a singlet from wrestling but with long pants. Yeah. This is bananas that they got man dressed like this. Good. What they're wearing. You see their nipples like their nipples are popped out. They're all super gate out leg. There's three quarter length Reebok high tops. Exactly. What the velcro. You had to get the velcro. That's the newest technology especially. Yeah. So look, every girl is dressed like, you know, I guess they look more like why they have tutors for an outfits. The girls have some of them expose the mid drift, like the dirty girls that they are. Then the other ones that we're a a one piece. Oh, Alan Thicke was hosting this mother fucker. Oh Shit. Course he was, oh shit. Look at him. Look at that hair. It's wonderful. Look at his jacket. Solve Miami vice doubt. Yeah. He's got shoulder pads. You got up, got to get rid of shoulder pads back then you could have shoulder pads. Yeah, I remember having shelter pads and my first jacket. It's nice. It makes you look better.

Speaker 1:          03:49          It isn't like a stuffed bra for a girl. It is. Yeah. It's the same thing. Yeah. Yeah. But how weird that people, so do you remember people actually dressing like that and in a class situation, did they go to classes, dress like that grade school? We had uniforms and stuff, so no, I never took an aerobics class. But see if you can find video footage of an aerobics class, if all the guys that dress like that, those dudes got punked. Yeah. Somebody talked to him into dressing like a dancer. Yeah. Yeah.
