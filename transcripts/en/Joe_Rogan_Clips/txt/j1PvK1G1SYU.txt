Speaker 1:          00:00          You know, he's, he's doing a good job with it, but he also said he's, he's the highest paid fighter in Beltour. I mean, just all kinds of like silly stuff, you know, it's just like, dude, is that what he said? No. So he's chill son in a little bit. He's a dork man. Just huge door. So he's just like one of those things where it's like, well, but when the guy's making his debut and you are a world champion or a former world champion at this point, what, what, what inspires you to call a guy like that out? Just because I mean it doesn't it help him? Yeah, I guess. I guess it does, but it also, I mean I also woke up to 150 mentions on Twitter, so it's like, well at least people are talking, you know, at least people that, you know, people are talking.

Speaker 1:          00:35          I mean that's the other thing too is, is always navigating the, the narrative and talking about, you know, getting people to talk, getting people to talk about, I mean over the last couple months, the amount of times, like as soon as could be for the amount of people that were just talking like, hey, you're the only guy that can match Khabib's wrestling. You're the only guy that could notify as wrestling. I mean to get yourself in the conversation. That's what it all is. It's all well style's definitely make fights. And that was what, what became very interesting, uh, after the outlier quantify where people were looking at. Okay, what about high level wrestlers who have more refined striking. Yeah. And how do they line up? And Kevin Lee was a big one that people kept talking about, but you are a big one that people kept talking about too.

Speaker 1:          01:15          Cause you were saying that you think you could beat him 100% and him, you know, having that fight with, I acquaint to who he was a prohibitive favorite over, but it went the full five rounds. And you know, I Quinta, although never want around, showed some chinks in the armor. So chinks in the armor showed it showed what happens when Khabib can't take you down. I mean, it's, it's tough whenever the one thing that you've always been used to dominating with isn't working and then you're stuck, you're stuck throwing punches and you, and you're in, you know, you know, he, he just, he's a, he's a little bit behind in the striking aspect. Dude, I've got a ton of respect for the Guy Mauler at certain times he looks unbeatable. He has looked unbeatable where I've looked at it and other people have looked at it and people that have fought him, that have talked that I've liked the Barboza fight, he just fucking mauled Barboza and it's, and it's just a, it's a battle of wills, man inside of a cage.

Speaker 1:          02:09          And it's just like we talked about, I knew I could outpace people. I knew I could out out cardio, then I could out tough them. You know, certain people get to that breaking point and they break and they can see it. They go into their shell and they say, I did a good job, but this one's on him. This is his guys who don't have that deep, deep wrestling background. And they face a guy who does. There's moments in the fight where you see that where you saw that thousand yard stare and Barboza is ours. We was like it a slog. Like I can't keep doing this. He goes into defensive survival mode and you know when a guy does have a deep background in wrestling and also can strike, that's what makes it interesting. And this is why MMA is such a complex sport because there's so many variables, there's so many techniques you can use.

Speaker 1:          02:56          There's so many situations where you might have an advantage or your opponent might have an advantage. And it's just, we live for these matchups, these stylistic matchups. So when something like that happens and a guy like could be B has a fight where all these questions get presented, that's where a guy like Michael Chandler comes into the mix. Yeah. Well, and I love like, after that fight too, because I said something, I posted a video that you see the video me scrambling with comar really small, like crazy and it was awesome. And I said, if, if a, if all he has his wrestling, how do you beat a man? It can't be taken down, you know? And, and I got so many messages from, you know, Russian guys that just said it could be time, could be like, of course, you know, and it's like, um, yeah, I mean, it's, uh, it's one of those things, man, where I mean, that, that fight with Eddie.

Speaker 1:          03:42          I mean, the fight with could be, that's exciting. Kumara who has gotta be going fucking crazy right now, seeing Colby Covington getting a shot to the interim title. He's like, you mother fuckers. Yeah, I know. Yeah. He's, he wants to fight that dude. No, I, no, I wouldn't, I mean, that dude is, I mean, he is, he's a specimen. He's got wrestling. He's got striking. I mean, you, you watch him spar or you watch him hit myths or you watch his composure and his confidence while he's sparring and do all that kind of stuff. You'd think he's been striking since he was 11 years old. He just started after, after college, you know. Well, he had his good, tough fight with, uh, with, um, meek mill. Yeah. He'd mail Mika whatever, Emil Meek. Um, but I think that a meal meek is extremely underrated. Extreme manner. I mean, he's a fucking tough guy.

Speaker 1:          04:29          Very physically strong. Very, very strong. I was, I was email me a couple of times. I was like trying to mimic him. Oh, are you in training camps? But yeah, we're at the same time and he needs it. He's done that. Him and I train a ton together and it works out well for me because he's a bigger guy. I like to go with a little bit bigger guys so I can just continue to get stronger and manipulate bodies that are bigger than mine, you know? Yeah. And a lot of people were criticizing him for not being able to finish meek. But I'm like, you're, you're crazy. Yeah. That is a fucking animal. It's, it's, it's nuts. The amount of people, you know, armchair quarterbacks that are dead are literally out there. Think saying, you should have finished this guy. We are all professional, like professional fighters training day in and day out.

Speaker 1:          05:07          It's not easy to finish a guy sometimes. I was saying, you've got to stay the fuck away from your Twitter mentioning. Yeah. It like, man Shit. Oh my goodness. Especially for a guy like you, if you do have something like an ankle injury like that, that one fight and then you got to stay offline for a few weeks for sure. I mean, I still get it to this day. Well, how are you training? Are you working on your rubber ankles or, you know, it's like a couple other fuckers. They know your soft spot, man. They start poking. It's good.
