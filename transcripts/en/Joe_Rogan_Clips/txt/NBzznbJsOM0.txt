Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. You pulled me in buddy. Uh, I was uh, I was in Los Angeles and I got a call from my manager and it was essentially saying, all right, there's this thing that we got an offer for. I'm sure you're not going to want to do this, but next friend Jeff says, scam. What a pitch. Mine as well. And now here we are many, many years later. Um, that was UFC 12 in 1997. Uh, and uh, Bob Myerwitz was the president and owner of needs. Just give him the finger. How dare you? Is that what that was? No, it was picking my Bob Myerwitz was the, uh, the owner and a Campbell Mclaren. What was your official title? Producer, you know cocreators what they call me now? Aye. Aye. Aye. E p. Dot. Shows and was the head of programming for the company. So you were there for you fc 1.01 young guy was, oh my boy. I was like a little hill. See my up there on the screen.

You look more like a fight or now than when you started. Well I didn't lift weights done. That's why I started doing Jujitsu. Like right before I did that show. But back then I was just doing kickboxing. No, no weightlifting ever. But once I started June doing Jujitsu and getting manhandled, I said to put some meat on, this is ridiculous. I'm tired of getting raped. Well the Gracies, here's the pledge they made to me and he'd go, you know, gamble gums, study Brazilian, Jujitsu, Gracie Jiu Jitsu with the family.

You don't get good at Jujitsu by not getting your ass kicked. Everybody gets their ass kicked. It's impossible to not get your ass kicked and get good at Hugh Jitsu. You have to do it. You have to experience it. Do you think you're good at Jujitsu? I got a couple of black belts.
