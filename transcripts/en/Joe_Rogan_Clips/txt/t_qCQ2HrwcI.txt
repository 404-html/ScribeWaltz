Speaker 1:          00:00          Is that they're promoting all the kindness promoting on the fall once a day and my five year olds, okay, but what I'm saying is kindness. Unless you're a right wing person. Now, if you think on the right, then they want to attack you, then they want to do want to demonize you and if they could shut you down and silence you and find some sort of a bullshit excuse to do so. And a lot of cases, it seems like some folks lean in that direction and this is where it gets dangerous because you can't, it's like if someone says, Hey, if I knew how to fight, I'd run in front of Pizza. I just fuck everybody up. Well, you'd be dead in a year because eventually people are going to kick your ass and kill you. You can't just beat people up. Well yeah, one on one basis, but it's the everybody gangs up against you.

Speaker 1:          00:38          It's that childhood childish mentality. I'll just knock this person out and nothing else will happen. Like that's not, you know, you're setting a whole thing in motion. When you silence someone, you're setting a whole thing in motion. And this is something that we're all learning. This is what we have to come to grips with. Social media has only been around for a really short amount of time. It's only been around in this kind of form for 10 plus years and we're, we're figuring it out and these people that think that they can just silence people and shut people down without it having a bad effect on all of us. It's not right. It's not right. Well, I appreciate you should be a path, one of the empty spaces. Good. Eddie, what do you think should be done about the denial of the reign of terror of censorship and said, middling going on?

Speaker 2:          01:27          Uh, I don't know. Shit. You know, all I know is that it seems that the right is being censored a lot. And when you look at the left and how they've been acting, I mean, they're acting like psychopaths, like pick, you know, putting signs up for late term abortions and all that shit. They're pushing that. There's people pushing that AOC there. It's, it's like someone who's trying to get fired. You know when you're, you have a job when you want to get fired.

Speaker 1:          01:58          I'm just telling you a four on the floor who runs whole CIA squad and he said, what do you think Alex? It's like they want to lose. What's the cyop but I don't know. That's, it seems like they're trying to, it's so bad. It's so bad. How much of that is influenced by people that are trying to fuck with the whole system? Imagine if this is like stage five Russian influence. Just get people to support later. Like figure out a way to get people to support super late term abortions. Figuring out a way to get people to Support Trans Women competing as women with no hormone replacement on one high school were like some 25 year old dude's like 18 year old girls. He takes all the, all the titles like now guys haven't, you know, it's hilarious. It's hilarious. Imagine if your daughter was up for a scholarship and she had to compete against some six foot five man who identified as a woman wanted to play basketball.

Speaker 2:          02:51          I feel a, if you've, if you've committed a crime, if you're a felon, you can't chop your dick off.

Speaker 1:          02:57          I like the Japanese model. They hey, because I don't care if you're a trans or you're dude, once people went, I don't literally, I'm a libertarian, don't act like I'm trying to suppress you. But the Japanese said, Hey, uh, you don't get the Trans destination unless you chop the Johnson and the way goes off and it's like, hey, you get, taxpayers will pay for it. You get that vagina bill and then you sit there and do it. Leave like, you know, I think there's a lot of people that are legitimately trance. That's not the problem. The problem is them wanting to compete as women and Martina Navratilova it just caught a rash of shit cause she was talking about it, you know, to the famous tennis star, she's talking about it that women are breaking all these records and right after she said that these kids, number one and two were transgender.

Speaker 1:          03:37          That one, the girls high school track meet and it's just, you know, at a certain point of time you gotta go, you gotta stop doing this. This is, we're talking about combat as somebody because they think they're another sex. I sat in the same timeline, I watched like bike races and running races and soccer and, and high jumping. It's a dude. Like he thought just like this is, you're bigger than me. They were like these six foot, $4, he was soldiers were kicked my house. Oh Lord. And the girl or like, I mean that's, that's been a little less man. Yeah, there's a, there's some nonsense going on. There's some people that are legit and then there's some people that are just legitimately crazy. I mean there's like with everything in life is people that are legitimately trans and there's people that have no man wants to see himself as a woman in a lodge.

Speaker 1:          04:22          Lodger neck shows the Kimball's that happens, that's their issue, whatever. Or vice versa. But like, I'm going to watch NFL and like we're supposed to like, you know, like they had a women's NFL and it's all guys and they say they're women. It was like a thing. And even when last year where the guy comes in with tattoos, a big beard and it was in the police report, the guy had like a foot long cock and he goes, do a cervix jam. What kind of police report is this? And the, the nurse said, Oh sir, uh, I don't see a vagina. And it was in the report. The man had a foot long dick. So she's supposed to mentally yoga. Okay, well let me check all this and decide that you've got all this. I mean, it's just like, it's mental illness man. It's not that I hate somebody that feels that they're a woman or a man or whatever.

Speaker 1:          05:11          That's the lie that like, Oh, you need to accept this or you hate ever imagine if all this ridiculous propaganda really was like the very, very highest level Russian meme farm propaganda. And this is why the people, that could totally be a thing, this the most posthumously leftist. Even things like these babies being resuscitated and then killed like that. People wouldn't freak out when they heard a guy talk about that kind of shit. Imagine if this is all just designed to make everybody go fucking crazy. Joe. I wish it was the governor saying it and then doing it and there's just one point we're going to this transmission. What is the end game? What is the end game? Alex? We're told as humanities, bad Humana's wrecking things, but the very environmentalist groups that doing this are all like weird transhumanist, anti human. I'm old transhumanists if I really get life extension but it's all at Oh you die, your upload to a machine. I'm just saying anything you see the big corporate media promoting, they don't know what they're doing. I've been around them, I've talked to them. They don't know. I don't think I know. I don't think Joe knows. I don't think Eddie knows, but I think in the spectrum of like one to a hundred we're in the 95th percentile. If we're really being woke.
