Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. We never found that video of the evergreen professor throwing his hands around. Oh yeah, there's one video. I'm pretty sure it's in, but I need to like double check and listen to make sure it's the part they're talking. Okay. Cause it was getting line and sent it to me and I had it, they sent it cued up like right where it is and it's, it's so hilarious. There's probably, you know what I, it's queued up in a website. If you Google Evergreen, uh, at, what is he, the president of evergreen pro. Oh I'm in evergreen hand motions are a micro aggression. Google that emotions are a microphone. They have it, there's a website for sure that as an article where they show the video and they have it queued up and when it's queued up you can see the kids laughing when they get the teacher to put his hands behind his back. Well see it. But that's them not understanding what they really are looking for. Part of it feels like ha ha major do it. And another part says that's a microaggression. Don't do that. Where it's like, if you believe that, that don't laugh at someone for not doing it anymore. What they're doing is just enjoying power. These kids have taken over the school, right? Yeah. That's it. Okay. Gimme some gimme some volume. Yes.

Speaker 2:          01:17          That's not appropriate. He's apologizing. Walks up to the presence. Like put your hands down. Put his hands to his side. Yes, dude. And they're laughing at him. Pastors were slaves and your ancestors were not. Your ancestors came here. I'll free choice and decided to bring along people. Oh, they're not out their own free will to work and build this country. My Dad was letting you know that slavery still have repercussions in society today and that is what we're here about. Three for questions right in front. Applause over. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          02:12          Yeah. She seems to not know. Oh, there she is. Trying to get off and what does he do about that? He's clapping as well. He's clapping too. He needs a, he needs to seriously stop. He's clapping too. Like he had a really good point. You can't, it's something we know about, you know, just okay. The version of that, that super liberal left is the feminists, you know that version of that. This is it. There's a version of that which is just the feminists like that version of feminists. That erosion. Yeah. There's like there's versions, there's versions of masculine lists too. Right? There's one built. Right. I guess is it though? I don't know. I don't really understand. I don't know. Seems to me like the alt right for more, more than a lot of what they're doing is having fun. It doesn't seem like a troll.

Speaker 1:          03:01          Like some of it's like just straight trolling. A lot of it is, he was talking to us. I can't believe it. I was like, can't you believe it? Well maybe it was a job. I mean like Milo, Milo Yiannopoulos. Surely I got some so mad. Yeah. Milo is so like, it's so theatrical. So much of what he's doing, he seems like he's having, because I love it when they get on somebody and he just like shit on them a little bit. Like at like someone's a god to them. All of a sudden Beyonce after lemonade, things like that. If you shit on them a little bit, you could get people so fucking angry or you know, it's great. It's great. It's never been a time like this art fair. We get so many morons mad at you. I love it.

Speaker 1:          03:42          Um, but yeah, but so what I've noticed is that all of the Super Liberal, okay. You know how like American sports fans are Kinda dumb. How dare you? Not all the leave. I'm home more so than other places, but we're not very thought out. Rude political like analysis isn't that smart? The same way our liberal left or feminism is some of the, it's feminism in the world. Like other ones are more thought out and more interesting and more like just thoughtful in general. Dude, I think you left America became a fucking turncoat. That's what I'm hearing. I'm hearing a bunch of bullshit. Yeah. Yeah. So what do you think though? You should hear people talking. They're way smarter than the people we have. Like, like, so our people are just dumber saying this microaggression shit. Right. That's us having too much fucking free time. Is that what is that is you've left behind what's actually wrong and you're jumping off, which is a lot.

Speaker 1:          04:36          There's a lot wrong. Yeah. So like worry about that and calmed down. Micro gets you guys. It's not like there's better shit to do so you don't, shouldn't worry about what actually bothers you. This shut and bother you. You know, take that same venom and put it into something that's actually happening. There's this forced, okay, but like that girl that's circumcision, the girl that set up there and it's like your ancestors were not slaves. We weren't proud of your mind were, you know, in slavery has repercussions and then everybody starts clapping and it's like you are, you're right. But what is the point? What are we doing? Like, yeah, it's all obviously ancestors. Like when do we get over this ancestor thing? Like how many generations in do we do we just treat people as individuals and as people? What do they want? Some people got an advantage for sure.

Speaker 1:          05:21          White people got an advantage for sure. Okay. But it's not, it's, it's, it's more so, but it's not 100% of the time. So if I came from, uh, from, uh, uh, divorced household, I didn't, right. You know, and my dad wasn't around and my dad beat my mom, you know, that can be a way worse and harder experience then the Cosby kids. Right. You know? Right. Yeah. So it's like, just because you're this, it might make the odds harder for you, but it's not 100%, but there's an origins thing and one of the origins that every black kid has to face that when they think about it, is it someone down the line was a slave and they're not slaves anymore. But that's why people who look like him are here. They're all here because someone brought them over here in chains. Yeah. And there's still remnants of that. Right. And there's some, there's gotta be a weird self esteem or a self identity issue attached to knowing that everybody knows that your ancestors were slaves. And there's a certain, like there's a certain thing that people do when someone has something and someone else wants it.

Speaker 2:          06:25          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:25          You, if you have a a group of people that's different, it's like really easy to almost think of them as not you. Like that's how they've justified wars. That's how so many people I by dehumanizing the other, you know, and this, this thing that has to balance out that I guess is, I guess just the echoes of that. It's like we have to get so many generations away from the, from people being slaves and any repercussions of it socially I cannot, we have to get so far away that it doesn't factor in anymore where we don't care. Okay. That's well expressed for sure. Yeah. I like that.

Speaker 1:          07:08          That kind of like calm way to explain something. Rarely gets put out and of course screaming and he's yelling. You know why? Like you're not teaching anyone anything. The biggest problem on the left and the right, but the ones that are angry, the angry mobs is they never seek to educate. They only seek to like punish. Also grandstand. They seem sure want to make this bigger here and the lady's voice she was going for audience. The audience clap two, three times. Didn't get it. And it was like all keep going. She's seen Oprah. She knows how to manipulate a crowd. She knows how to get those people riled up. Yeah. Well listen man, that's part of being a person. Like that's half the reward for saying something that's right is the love that you get from people when you say that it's right and they recognize it and they go yes.

Speaker 1:          07:47          So people get addicted to that. Yes. So they constantly do things that they think are at least perceived as being right and they get very vocal with things when they perceive those things are going to get a very big reaction for standing up against them and it becomes this moral high ground sort of grand grandstanding peacocking sort of a thing where they just are constantly trying to let everyone even know how uncool it is to do this and how wrong it is to do that. Like settle the fuck down. Yeah. Like weird, weird thing. And then sometimes they'll see something that doesn't quite fit in. Like they'll sit there was trying to make, you know how they make rape a broader and broader and broader. Oh yeah. Which is really does think does a disservice to ripe. It does to be able to make it seem like, anyway, there was some coercion is rape where if we talk someone into it, yes, that's right. And then a bunch of men was like, oh, well if that's true, then I've been raped a bunch of times. This is the super liberal left. It's like, oh, we don't want to make that. We were on wanting to make you be able to evict them, so, okay, that's no longer rape.
