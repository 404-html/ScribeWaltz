Speaker 1:          00:00          So we should talk about this, uh, the Jack podcast cause everybody got so upset about it. And let's clear up a few things. First of all, the guy seems to be willing to talk about anything. It's not that I didn't want to talk to him about those things is just he was being, uh, I wouldn't say he's evasive, but he's basically just saying what he knew based on the company policy. I didn't know what else more to ask him. And people felt like I didn't press him hard enough and he to his credit reached out to me and said that he would offer to do another one to ask more questions. That's cool. And I said, that would be awesome. So I said, well, this is the thing that people seem to be upset about. They seem to be upset about very specific cases where people showed, um, like if, if people were right wing and they were posting things, they were banned.

Speaker 1:          00:51          Whereas people who are left wing or maybe a people of different races or allowed to post racist things or more offensive things and even docs people and didn't suffer any consequences for it. This is the argument. My problem is I don't spend enough time reading this stuff. I don't know. Like this is like when people get banned, like Anthony Cuny is a friend of mine. I don't really know why he got banned. I don't know what happened. There was that incident with that, that woman that punched him and he wound up getting fired. He was drunk and he said a bunch of really stupid shit and and, and Twitter and then later apologize for it. But I don't know if that's what got him fired. Kicked off Twitter. But he's my friend. So what I'm saying is all these other guys that have problems, I don't know what the fuck happened, man.

Speaker 1:          01:38          I'm busy. I really don't. I don't know. I don't even know what got Alex Jones kicked off, which is why I asked him because that was one of the last platforms for Alex Jones was Twitter. But something got him kicked off their take on it was it, they never kicked him off before because he didn't violate their terms of service. And another thing that's very encouraging that Jack said, and I know it's, it's fun to get mad at things. It's fun to get mad at him. It's fun to get mad at me for it. I get it. I'd probably do the exact same thing. I totally understand it, but one of the things that he said was that he believes that the ability to communicate on the Internet through Twitter or through these platforms is a basic human right. That's how he looked. Like I said, do you think of it like a network like NBC, like if you're an NBC, they can decide what's on and what's not on, or do you look at it like a utility?

Speaker 1:          02:32          And he specifically said that he looked at it more like that, that he thought it was a basic right. That's very encouraging. He also said that he would bring on whoever it is in his team that's responsible for these things. So we could hear from the actual person who decides who's getting banned and why they're getting banned and what, what is, what's the decision making behind all of these things? We can go over all of them. Um, I didn't, the podcast would create such a controversy, but that's probably poor prior planning on my part because my thought about it was, hey, I want to say like, it's fucking crazy to be running Twitter. Like it's crazy that this thing exists. The president uses a platform. I want to talk about the dude who created this and what does this like to have this thing evolve to become what it's become.

Speaker 1:          03:22          Because it didn't start out that way. It started out like fun shit like, uh, at Brian red bands going to the movies, you know what I mean? Like that's what people used it for. And then along the way became this global method of distributing information where people use it in warzones man. They use it to, to tell people where attacks are. These are for all kinds of crazy shit. It's like a, it's a really powerful but strange medium. I didn't think about getting into the weeds with all the very specific people that got banned. I just wanted to find out why they banned people. That was my take on it. I know there's a lot of conservative voices that have never been banned. I don't think Steven Crowder has been banned. I don't think Cernovich has been banned as he'd been banned. There's a bunch that have not been banned.

Speaker 1:          04:08          Right. So it's not like they banned all right wing voices. So what is it? I don't know what it is. What he said. People reporting the tweet and then somebody's looking at it going, well this does violate our policy and maybe you know all these people that that got banned thigh lated the policies somehow, you know, it's probably as simple and cut clean is that, you know, it's, it's not that simple. Right? Because they make their own policies and it's also not that simple. If people are allowed to say similar things that are very racist in an in vast generalizations about white people, which seems to have been the case and at least a few instances where people reported that people said fucked up things about white people, but there was no repercussions. And you know, that's where the argument becomes these people are more oppressed and so the white people were thought of as the oppressor.

Speaker 1:          05:06          So you have this white privilege thing that people like to use now as a reason to, to decide to like silent someone like check your white privilege. That's a, that's an interesting thing that's happening. So if, if there's this genuine movement where people think that it's okay to say things about one race, whether you like it or not, that's racism. And if you're allowing that from any one side and not allowing it from another side, it seems hypocritical. Look, it's very distasteful. The idea of racism against black people in this country is very distasteful to everybody. Almost everybody who's not a racist, right? Because of the history of this country, because of slavery, because of all these things. It's a different connotation, but if you just allow people to say terrible things about any race, it's racism. You are allowing, uh, like a predetermined attitude about a race.

Speaker 1:          06:02          Some people have done this, they have made generalizations, generalizations, racist statements about white people. The really weird thing that people were thrown around these days is that you can't be racist against white people because racism is about power and influence. It's about using your, you're in the booth at that black people are not powerful. The white people power from the white people, the ones who are oppressed, so it's impossible to be racist against him. That sounds like horseshit to me. I'm not buying that. That doesn't make any sense. It's not beneficial to anybody to generalize. This is what we got to get in our head. It doesn't matter if you're black or if you're white or if you're, whatever the fuck you are. It is not beneficial to generalize, to take a person out of the group that we think of as just human individuals that you, you have to be an individual.

Speaker 1:          06:55          I mean it. I acknowledged the fact that people look different. They have different heritages, they have heritage's, they have different, different ancestry, they have different occupation. There's different parts of the world. There's all these differences, but at the end of the day, the only way we're all going to get true equality and true kinship and comradery as human beings is if we recognize we're just all a human being. That's it. There are very big differences in the way we look and the the things we like. That's cool, but as soon as you say, you can say shitty things about white people or white men, that leaves everybody who doesn't fit that description guilty in this weird way or presumed guilty because of a racist statement. That's all it is. It's not good for anybody. I get it that it's different than racism against black people in America. A country that was built essentially in a lot of ways by slavery.

Speaker 1:          07:53          There's a war for slavery in this country and that is a crazy reality that it's not your responsibility. It's not mine. I didn't do it. You didn't do it, but it's real. Therefore, as a person who is aware of his history, the history of this country, racism against white people seems different, but it still sucks to be racist against racist against black people rather seems different. But it still sucks to be racist against white people. Sucks to be racist against Puerto Ricans. It's not good. It's not good for anybody. It's, that's what we have to understand about this social media thing. What actually did happen and what is happening, why is it happening and if it's just some social justice warrior ethic that you're not debating, it doesn't seem fair. It seems like there should be a conversation about this and I bet they're super reasonable, really intelligent people and it's possible they can come to a, a good place that we can all agree to that is possible.

Speaker 1:          08:50          I'm not a cynical person, I'm sorry. I know a lot of young folk him, they just want those to just want, guess what? They already have it. They have more money than they could ever spend. And my dealings with Jack as a person, he seems like a very nice guy and a very smart guy. And, and a very empathetic guy. I just think he's in a crazy, unmanageable situation to be running something like Twitter. Yeah. And there's probably people that did something that they should have done in terms of silencing people moving things around. It's probably happened. It's a weird thing when people have influence over people and there's, there have been videos had been proven. We're executives from a bunch of different social media corporations have talked about how to silence certain voices, how to push down certain voices. Um, this is something that needs to be discussed.

Speaker 1:          09:43          Like is this, uh, uh, as a policy as a whole, is it, you know, because you, you think you're pushing the right message. Like as soon as someone thinks they're pushing the right message, but they don't have it, there's no debate about that, right? They just decide our way's the right way and they're pushing this and there's a radical opposition to that message from half the country like that. Like, but you'd be like, no, no, no, no. But this is the one that's in control of the narrative. This is the one that's in control of social media. It's this far left leaning ideology and the other part gets pushed aside. That's a very bad situation for all of us because there has to be conversation. There has to be debate because if there's not, it's just shores up the differences between two people and they fucking hate each other even more.

Speaker 1:          10:29          I did not take that into account and I fucked up. That's my mistake. That is my mistake when I made that podcast, but it didn't take it easy on him because I didn't want to discuss those issues. I just didn't think enough of it in advance. I'm not as involved in it as other people are. I'm aware that there's censorship and social media. I'm aware my, my ideas going into that conversation were more about how insane this method is for distributing information for the people that have been banned and for the people that were fans of the people that are banned. I can understand whether it be upset at me. It has nothing to do with any preconceived notions that I had is just how the conversation took place. It's all it is. And if you felt left down by that, you didn't feel like it was an is extensive enough.

Speaker 1:          11:18          I'm more than willing to do it and go further into it and we're going to, and Jack offered it and he's going to bring someone else who's gonna explain things to us. I think this would be very beneficial for everybody. I also think that there should be a road to redemption. I think if you've got something that's important as Twitter or Facebook or Instagram, if you're not stealing someone's stuff, like, you know, using copyrighted music or something on an Instagram page where you get banned over and over again for doing it, but you keep doing it. If it's not something like that, if it's, if it's, uh, an ideological difference, if you, maybe you crossed a line that they decided was a line, it should be able to work your way back. You see the shoe, there should be a way where you can sign up again.

Speaker 1:          12:04          Me and I get a new email address. I don't mean that, I mean be the same person you should be. You should be able to be the same person. There should be a way what? There should be different levels. Definitely everybody. People fuck up, man. They they fuck up and they make mistakes, right? And people also grow. I mean there's this a guy that was on Sam Harris' podcast, um, Christian peak. Eleni I think is his name. He was a fucking white supremacist to full on white supremacist and now he is the exact opposite. He's, he's like this very progressive guy who gives speeches on the, the dangers of racism and that and the ideology, how it caught up with him. Now if he got band when he was a young man and making terrible decisions and then became a better person, shouldn't we give it a guy like that?

Speaker 1:          12:51          A chance to get back in a platform, right? And without making a whole new screen name, like maybe it would be, and I don't think there's anything wrong with the anonymous model. There's some things that are really good about it, right? Like people like Jack even talked about this, that people can report news stuff and not worry about fear of retribution that they can, you know, they can whistle blow and not worry about fear of retribution if someone's life is on the line, but they're trying to provide a service to the general public or they're trying to give people information that maybe might even save lives but could put them at risk, especially in like third world countries or war torn countries. That could be a huge problem if you have to post, you know, Brian Red Band, if there's the only way you can get this information out, you have to use your whole name.

Speaker 1:          13:39          But it probably be better off for everybody if people had a way of communicating with each other. Like it's just person to person. And I think the real problem is when people try to engineer these conversations, and this is another conversation about youtube. People have said that we're deleting comments on Youtube. We're not deleting anything. We haven't deleted any comments. I don't know how it works. I don't read them. I'm sure people say mean things. Have a good time. The thumbs up, thumbs down thing, look, we don't have to have that on there. You don't have to have comments on their youtube gives you the option to have comments on and to have the thumbs up, thumbs down. I'm not taking those off. Have a good time with it, but we're not fucking with that. There's something that they're doing that's not, it's not, I post at three 41 and Jamie posts it three 42 and this is the line of the comments.

Speaker 1:          14:38          It's not like that. They've got their own way of doing it. The question is why does youtube do it? What's there? What? What are they trying to do is are they trying to block out spam? Are they trying to block out hate speech? I tr are they trying to engineer conversation, comment, order comments on no comments disappear. They go away. A lot of times it's automatic. If somebody flags a comment that will just take the comment away until it's like looked over upon only one person. Yeah. On I think on youtube that that happens quite often. Probably be as little as one or two people. Yeah. So that is probably what's happening to all you folks that think your comments are getting deleted. No one is deleting shit. Yeah. Look, I'm, I'm not attached to what I do in the sense that I'm unwilling to look at what I do wrong.

Speaker 1:          15:27          I tried to look at everything that I do wrong, including this. So if you were upset at this podcast because you thought somehow or another I sold out cause I didn't ask him any more questions. I just asked him the questions I wanted to ask. I understand you have more costs, more questions. And I do too. I have more questions too, especially upon seeing people's reaction to it and upon, you know, making myself pay more attention to all these various stories. Uh, Matt sent us a list of them. Some of them are really fucking crazy. There's some crazy things people have said and not gotten in trouble for. Whereas other people said things that really weren't that bad and got in trouble for it. Why is that? That's a good question to ask. So we'll, we'll concentrate on that. We're just going to work out a date.

Speaker 1:          16:12          So my humblest apologies to all of you. Don't not trying to let anybody down. I always tried to do my best. That's it. And, and also, here's another clear one. No one tells me what to do. There's no one, there's no secret person behind the scenes. If I fuck up, it's because of me. It's my fuck up. I should have prepared more. I should have thought about it more, but I didn't realize like how upset people would be. I think you did a great, I thought it was a great interview and I didn't even think of that. I thought you kind of touched on it a little when you were talking about Alex Jones and I think that was like, okay, you know, this is what happens. Well, it's a very specific group of people that are upset. Right wing guys, right? There's a lot of American flags, a lot of pepe the frog.

Speaker 1:          16:51          It's all right people. Which luck man easily could've been me at many points of my life easily. Especially being a troll online, you know, if you're working in some fucking job. And you're making pepe the frog memes and you're fucking with people. I get it. I get it. It's one of the things I like about the Internet. Like I don't, I don't want to be comfortable. I'm like, I don't, I don't want to be comfortable all the time. I want, I want a little bit of chaos. I like the fact that just people like, they're like that fucking, I was upset that that radio, that podcast, they took it down where they were fucking with Shiloh laboo with those guys from four Chan. And the way they took it down was they contacted radio lab and said, those guys are white supremacists and they support white supremacy.

Speaker 1:          17:34          You know, and, and you just, you know, you made these people that are awful, terrible people that write terrible things. You, you, you gave them props. But the thing about something like four Chan is no, you might read some terrible things, but you've got to realize you're also reading terrible things from anonymous people that are working at their jobs most of the time. And they're trying to fuck with people's head and the trying to get people upset. They're there. They're having a good time fucking with people. If you want to take them as that, that's like them. You like giving, giving a talk to a dear friend or them giving an affidavit in court. Well, you're missing the whole thing. It's entertainment like half of the whole reason why they're doing it as entertainment. They didn't go steal Shiela booze flag and go and go right to the camera.

Speaker 1:          18:18          Go Fuck Shiela Boob by using coordinates from photographs of the sky where they figured out where the fucking with the constellations lie and then drove around honking their horn so that they could locate where it was by using the Webcam and listening to how close they got to it. I mean it's fucking genius shit. And he got taken down just by this accusation of them being racist. But the thing about a forum like four Chan or Reddit or anything, you have so many fucking people. You have thousands and thousands and thousands of people. If you just have 10 cunts posting jokes about black people, that's all you need to ruin the reputation of thousands of people. So for someone to say that everybody that was like Fuck Sheil Abou is some racist and the white supremacists, that's a cheap way out. That's a cheap way out. I bet. More likely it's some duties board and he sitting in front of his fucking computer and he works all day and this is where he escapes.

Speaker 1:          19:18          He escapes and types and writes things. Then check some later and then it goes back to it and type thing checks and it keeps him sane and does stupid fucking cubicle. That's a lot of the people. So they pulled that whole amazing podcast down because of that. Look what he would, the Shiela booth thing was ridiculous. He will not divide us. Come on, stop. Stop. We get a chance that everywhere. It's funny what they did. They mock something. That's their way of mocking it. Nobody got hurt. They made it out like it was as like awful crime. They committed on this, this amazing person who's just trying to change the world. No, no, they, they prank Chai laboo and they said, Fuck Shaya Laboo is that the buff? Whatever it is. Shilo Lebouf at that. Sure. He's a nice guy too. He probably did something silly. It's a little silly.

Speaker 1:          20:11          He will not divide us. What they did was funny. It's a funny reaction. I liked that. I liked that this is is important part of this thing. If it wasn't for people like that, there would be no podcast. Now the like to dislike ratio that you see on youtube videos is fascinating, right? Because it's weaponized and they're thinking about trying to ban that now because so many people use it to fuck with people. I hate to say this about you folks, but every time we have a check on here, they get fucking torture. The like to dislike, right? Like it's ruthless except Rhonda, Patrick, Cep, Rhonda, Patrick. But it's just a, it's weaponized. It's the, they're just going to dislike it because, cause it's fun. It's fun. It's also fun to throw a rock at a window. It's fun. Yeah. I mean, and some of them probably didn't even wash the podcasts like thumbs down. It gives them a low disliking. It gives a little bit of power in the algorithm of d ranking. It affected something. And then people who liked it, there's probably a lot of them that didn't even watch it. It's a button you can press. People are weird, you know, but it's clearly, it shows by the amount of dislike the people moved on it and they were upset about it. Um, so that's basically it.
