The dance. They do. Yeah. They do a dance for their, for their own Dojo. Yeah. Well they do. Everybody does it and there's a real logic behind it. The logic is that you warm up and that you really, you relax yourself, you're kind of performing in front of all these dance moves and also people are staring at you, so it kind of wears off your nerves.

Speaker 1:          00:45          There's a reality to that. It's, it's actually really wise and you lose, you limber up your body to like, a lot of the stuff they're doing is they're getting down on one knee like a lunge and they're bouncing a little bit and so the limb bring up their body and then on top of that they're actually doing this dance in front of all these people and it calms the nerves a little bit. Wow. Yeah. John Fix. We're always talking about that. About like the idea of people watching you. It's actually a big thing and the UFC is like a bigger people watching you then. Oh yeah.

Let's [inaudible] was rude and I was like, what the fuck is wrong with you? Crazy. It's weird. It was a stand up. But like yeah, the sense I used to panic when I would talk to bank tellers.

Speaker 1:          02:07          What? Yeah. I used to go to a bank teller. It gets super nervous right before I'd have to talk to a bank teller. Why? I don't know. It's no reason for it. When I was a kid I've, I really felt like a loser. I really did. I had like serious low self esteem issues up until like high school you up until martial arts. And then once I started doing martial arts and getting really good at it and then teaching, it kind of calmed me down. Experience. Yeah. And then it kind of like, was it, believe it or not, almost like a natural path to stand up. But I remember before that, uh, being very awkward, talking to people, like very nervous, talking to people I didn't know and I just didn't, it didn't feel like I still get that where I'm like, I don't know how to talk. I just trying to draw. I don't know how to talk to. Yeah, I know, right. Especially if it's an odd thing. And so, you know, it's was worse when they know you too, and answer your questions. So broad.
