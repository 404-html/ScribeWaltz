Speaker 1:          00:00          Be careful and walk this line between just, just completely bring them in but not trying to change them into who you are. Did the six year old already have things he was really into or sports or activities or, yeah, he was, well the funny thing has sun is really athletic and I'm, I'm really not. So I know you guys are, but I'm not. I'm so Nomis and me especially, he's an acrobat. You saw what I was doing yesterday cause an animal. But uh, but no, he's really athletic and he's just always been good with, with all of that stuff. And it's funny for me because I wasn't that kid at all, but it's great for me cause I'm like, he's able to do this stuff that I wanted it so badly when I was little. I sucked at sports and I so want him to be good at sports and he's really good at it and it makes me, what does he play?

Speaker 1:          00:46          Well, he, I mean whatever he plays, he's just tends to be pretty good at it. So he played flag football for a while and he's playing lacrosse now and he's played soccer. Keep him away from Lacrosse and football. We were just playing it with Brennan shop the other day. I had no idea how many people get knocked the fuck out playing lacrosse. Really crossing guard island man. Why Lindt? We were saying like there's a difference between this, even in football in that they're striking each other. They're allowed to, they're allowed to hit each other with the stick but they're also striking each other with elbows, the running in and they have the stick in their hand and they're elbowing each other in the face as the running. I mean Whoa Shit. It's a crazy amount of force if they generate and these kids are getting flatline touch. Cause I had Dale Earnhardt Jr here today on really Nice Guy, great guy.

Speaker 1:          01:33          Um, suffered 12 concussions over a period of four years racing. Yes. And has like some significant brain damage because of it that he had to go through a therapy for to help them like to the point where he was walking and he had a hold on to things because it's balancing so fucked up. He couldn't, couldn't just walk, couldn't get off the couch and walk to the bathroom. He had a hold on to like a table and a chair and hit him. Make his way through all of this from concussions and you know what they're getting in Lacrosse so they're going to get football. It's all the same shit. Head trauma. It's head trauma. Yeah, so I'm a terrible parent.

Speaker 1:          02:10          My kids go to a very nice school. It's a great school and we went to a football game the other day where the older kids are playing football and I'm just sitting there. All the other parents are having a good time and I'm like, brain damage, brain damage. There's some brain damage, there's some break. I'm like, Jesus fucking Christ. These are kids. They're kids running at each of the full clip, smashing and withdrawn. It fall to the ground. They see the kid get up slow and hope put his hands on the ground, he's all fucked up. I'm like, this is crazy. Look, you always felt like people, I always felt like lacrosse because my high school had lacrosse too and I always felt like it was way crazier ones cause I didn't know about it. And then I'm at this school and they have it and I'm like, this shit is nuts because they have stiffness. Yeah. And they're just, Oh yeah, of course. Yes. If you're a football player, you can become some Herschel Walker type character and become a baller. Yeah, that's true. But you got no shot. If you're a Lacrosse player, I love when they interview

Speaker 2:          03:00          like all the guys in the NFL, they're like, uh, the young guys, they're like, you know, all this evidence is that your lifespan is going to be way shorter and it's going to be probably horrific at some point because of the impact of what you're going through playing football. You know, what are you thinking about that? They're like, Shit's worth it, man. This is awesome lifestyle. Nobody is like, you're getting some guys that you see retire early, which was unheard of 10 years ago guys, one guy came out, played his rookie year and retired, you know, you're getting guys early retirement. Um, some guys play finish out a contractor up for a big contract and they're out. Yeah, that's happening. But there's still, you know, there's no shortage of guys who are like, I'll take the guarantee whatever my signing bonuses and take some brain damage with it. That's how our brains work. Our brains are designed to not have that kind of foresight and you get much older. Of course you're like satisfying me now. I don't know what that is, but you can tell people, hey, whatever it is you're doing right now, this is really going to cause you a reference

Speaker 1:          04:03          when like today. No. Well fuck it. You know. Well that's the same way we deal with climate change. Literally the same thing. People with driving around with cars blowing smoke. I like, yeah, one day we'll have every fucking fix it. It's going to be a real proud, like you tell us what can be a real problem here on earth and like 300 years and they were like, that sucks. Whatever, whatever. I won't be here Bro. Or even 40 years, sadly. Yeah. It will be like, all right, there's also the issue, we get a lot of head trauma. They get very impulsive and they, um, they don't make good decisions anyway, you know? So even if, you know, even if they could have the foresight, they would be, probably wouldn't make good decisions. They're don't, they're not thinking rationally. And they did some study. What was that study? Jamie? We've referenced this before where they, um, they looked at kids that play football literally from pop Warner all the way through college. And how many of them have CTE? Really? Oh, Jesus Christ. It's stunning. See, I, I always

Speaker 2:          05:02          felt like my, my point of view on it was always like, I played football fourth grade through high school, right. And I always just like, man, that's why you're so fucked up. I know, I know. That's what I'm fucking, but I just feel like, you know, the, like you have definitely some big, uh, in a, in an amateur career, you have some, you can think back. Like, man, I got my bell rung a Bell Rung. I don't know. I mean probably, I mean, here's the thing, in fourth grade and fifth grade you're like, that doesn't happen really. I mean, kids are like, you know, walking up and like wrapping up slowly. Did you, you're playing with kids who will eventually not play football even in sixth grade. Right. You know, so it starts to be you, you might have like a stud on a team in middle school and still a bunch of guys who won't play in high school and then in high school.

Speaker 2:          05:47          Yeah, there's definitely some, uh, athletes that stand out for sure. I mean, those are the kids that are eventually go on, but you play teams are, there's weeks where you're just like, no one is really good on this team, you know? Um, and you'll have a game where you'll feel like, yeah, I mean there was a couple, I've got a couple good hits in, there was nothing really of impact. And then something will stand out. Like you'll play a school that has like an all state are all American player. You're like, Holy Shit, that guy fucking fucked me up bad. And, and you remember it. I mean, I remember it to this day, some of those like really stand out guys and you're like, that hit stuck with me. But that's once a year that you play that guy, right? Or that you remember a school that good and then if you don't go on to play in college really feels like kind of a, I dunno, a risk assessment where you're like, I didn't feel like that was, you know, do I have damage? I don't know. But I mean, once you get into college, football is where I feel like that's where you're really playing with really good athletes.

Speaker 1:          06:55          It's a friend of mine, a guy in his neighborhood. I'm a kid who was 21 committed suicide and he was a college player who was about to go into pull up into the pros. He was 21 years old really. And um, the uh, significant CTE, like just really ravaged. He every year a player played tackle football under the age predicted the early onset of cognitive problems by 2.4 years in behavioral and mood problems by 2.5 years. Yeah, but there's a study. Wow, this is okay. Average study found that 211 players who diagnosed with CTE after death, who played tackle football before age 12 suffered from cognitive behavioral and mood symptoms earlier than those players that didn't start to play till after age 12. Wow. They're saying that, okay. Study included 246 former players, 211 of whom were diagnosed with CTE after death. That's insane. Well, in college there's,

Speaker 2:          07:52          there's definitely, there's no such thing as getting around real high impact hits. That's it. Those are all people that know how to play. They're all athletes.

Speaker 1:          08:02          What they're realizing now is that sub concussive trauma is what's responsible for the majority of brain damage. What's subconcussive you're not getting a concussion. Oh yeah, he just getting rattled. Yeah. So getting rattled where it's not even fucking you up, but over time, over time, that and multiple hits that are just not, they're not knocking you out that just Jocelyn, you, you can always happen a lot. Yeah. Even get it from getting hit to the body. Right. You get hit to the body and your, your head snaps back and you, you don't even get hit in the head and you're like throwing up and your head's all fucked up and you're trying to figure out what's going on. It's because your brain's been mushing around inside of your head. Yeah. The thing that I remember too, the thing that stands out is when you, cause it's such thing as like bracing for a hit and then feeling it and you're like, fuck, but when you don't see someone coming, oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:49          Oh yeah. It's like a fight punch coming. Oh yeah. 100% yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, it's dangerous. You guys are saving my child's life. I'm telling you right now. He's good because I don't know that much about Lacrosse. I had to actually like Youtube Lacrosse to be like, how did you hold at the video? Cause there's some videos of some fucking hits that we were watching the other day. And Brendan Played Lacrosse in college. He played Lacrosse in college and football, Jesus. And then he fought in the UFC. So his brain looks like a walnut. It's gotta be man. You talked to him, you kind of know.

Speaker 1:          09:23          Yeah, it's a, it's a crazy fucking sports. Oh watch these guys just over and over again. These guys getting Kol, boom, boom. See that? I mean they're smashing each other. The impact is horrific. Oh fuck it. That boom, this, these are strikes. This is like me kicking somebody in the head. This is, this is not much different than a kick in the head. You're just playing him with an elbow. But the amount of force, so these guys are getting kicked in the head with these helmets on and if you think the helmets protecting your head, that shit ain't protecting anything. Boom, look at that. Boom. All right, look, I don't know anything about this stuff, but I've thought for a long time. Hard helmets. Ooh. Gotta just make it worse, right? Well, it makes you more confident that you got slam your head into somebody and then you don't realize how bad you're getting fucked up from that.

Speaker 1:          10:18          You know it's your head. When you get hit in the head, even though you have a helmet on, it's not going to crack your skull. Your brain still still subsist. It's hitting you. You get serious punishment smashing around in there. You're all the connective tissue. It's like, oh, it's awful. It's awful. Boom. And this is coming from a guy who's probably seen, I probably see more people get fucked up than 99.9% of the people that have ever lived in terms of like being there live when someone got the fuck beat out of them. I probably see more people get the fuck beat out of them than almost anyone that's ever lived in history. It's probably a small handful of people that have seen more. Sure. So yeah. How many fights have you called? Hundreds. Thousands, thousands. It least more than a thousand. Probably 2000 but then I've seen more, I mean, I've seen a bunch of live and when I was competing I saw a bunch of people get fucked up.

Speaker 1:          11:16          I mean, it's just, I've seen it a lot. It's just that when you can avoid that, avoid it. You know, especially something like Lacrosse, you can't, can't make a career out of it. Like get out of there because they actually just started because right now I'm used to like kids soccer where they're just running around chasing the ball. It's cute. It's fun to watch. And uh, and yeah, my son just got into Lacrosse and we play catch with the lacrosse stick and it's great. We have, we have a good time playing catch with it. But no, I haven't seen him get him about tennis, man, soccer, even soccer, which you think you know, like who, who's getting hurt in soccer? Soccer from heading the ball, just heading the ball, the ball flying. You hit it with your head. Soccer players are suffering from CTE to the point where they're starting to minimize the amount of heading they do in practices.

Speaker 1:          12:03          Really? Yes. This is what we're finding out about brains like this is, you know, there's a good friend of mine, Dr. Mark Gordon, who specializes in CTE. He deals with a lot of soldiers coming back and a lot of them that are, um, like my friend Andrew Marr, where they would blow open doors, so they'd set up a, a charge on a door and step back and the door blow. These guys mean he didn't even get hit with anything. Or maybe I eeds like that are nearby. Those guys suffer significant brain damage and it's just from the impact of just getting shook by an explosion, not even anything actually hitting them in the head. Which high school sport as the most concussions? Is it soccer girls, soccer girls soccer, cheerleading had rates CD boys football by 2015. Wow. I know. When you stop and you look at those, uh, like when they're going to commercial on the college game and they throw that grew up in the air and you're like, man, to get that right. The documentary, but it's one of the most dangerous sports show world is his high school cheerleading because these girls fall on a gym floor and just smack their heads on the floor. It's crazy.
