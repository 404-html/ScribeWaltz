Speaker 1:          00:00          What possessed you to want to swim around the entire UK? How many thousands of miles is that? Yeah. Uh, 2000 miles altogether to a thousand miles of swimming. Yeah. Yeah. It seemed like a good idea at the time. And then half way round I realized how big Great Britain was. But you, you've done some long swims before but not like nothing even remotely. Like what's the longest swim you did before this? I did. Um, I, this is a bit of a strange story. I did. Um, I tried to swim between Saint Lucia Martinique to Caribbean islands. Um, it's only 40 kilometers from point to point. And, and for charity I was trying to swim, uh, from point to point with a hundred pound tree attached to my trunks. Um, so I was pulling the hunch of Pantry, a six foot waves crashing down and, and I actually didn't make it from point to point.

Speaker 1:          00:48          I was like five kilometers from the end. And when I didn't make it, I decided to swing back the other way. So I ended up swimming over a hundred kilometers with a hundred pound tree. Took me 32 hours, but still didn't make it. So, so what, what went wrong where you didn't make it? Tides currents, you know, and, and I use get swept away. Yeah. Yeah. And it's usually attached to a tree. Right? How big was this tree? A. So a hundred pounds. But I mean it floats, but it was more of the drag. So if there's any influence from tidal currents and it's pulling you in one direction, I mean, I was basically going to Miss Martinique, so I know I was heading to Cuba, you know, somewhere like that. And then on the way back down, and they turned to me again and they said like, you're going to miss St Lucia, you're going to end up in whatever's further south than Saint Lucia.

Speaker 1:          01:35          Um, and I think I realized this as physically fit as you are. Um, the ocean just, just doesn't care, doesn't care. And so after that, this was last year, this was November last year. Um, kind of felt I had unfinished business with, with the ocean and came, but came back to England, a rung up from friends of mine at the Royal Marines. I said, guys, look, this is going to sound so strange. I said, but I just, I need to get out of my system. I just need to see how far I can swim in 48 hours. So I swan 40 hours. Um, I can't remember. It wasn't, yeah, I think it was 160 kilometers, something, something like that. And I finished and I had basically trench foot. So where your, your, your feet and your hands are. So kind of, I've got so much water in. This one was going moldy, you know, he's like, yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:20          So I had transferred, I'm sort of sitting there, nursing, nursing my feet, and one of the, one of the offices, uh, a good friend of mine and they came over and they just said, they went, you know, real English, Royal Marine. They said, you'll boy. And I said, yes. And they said, oh, what do you, what are you training for? And I said, uh, Oh, I'm training for a potentially attempting the world's longest current neutral swim. And then just paused and he, he sits his cup of tea and he looked me up and down. He just goes, that just sounds a bit lame. I was like, okay, what would you want me to do? And he pauses and he says, you just need a manner. We need to man up and swim around Great Britain. I was like, Whoa, I can't, I, I couldn't say no once the [inaudible] said, why don't you swim with me, bitch, did you do it mother fucker?

Speaker 1:          03:06          That's a crazy thing for someone to be asking you to do. Now I know. So I said, fine. Once the idea stuck with me, I mean, you know, we've got this real history and heritage of a British eccentric explorers. And for me growing up, there's a story of Captain Web. So the first guy to swim across the English Channel, and for those who don't know English Channel, uh, you know, the tides, they believe what? We're too strong. The water was too cold. They said you just can't make it across. The English Channel isn't possible. But captain web refuse to listen. And 1875 August across the English Channel. And this is the part I love on a diet of beef broth and brandy in a woolen wetsuit. He swam, I think it was 23 hours breaststroke with his head out of the water because, and I quote, front crawl was ungentlemanly like and, and there was that element that I just thought, that's amazing.

Speaker 1:          03:57          Front crawl, what is the front crossbar? So, so basically that's front the regular one. Yeah. But way back in 1875 it was like, no, that's Sarah's and gentlemanly. Yeah, it was the movement itself themselves. Yeah. It was still being developed as a technique. Whereas, you know, if you are a gentleman and you were a swimmer, you swim breaststroke, you know, exactly. Head out of the water the whole time, the whole way. 23 hours. And again, like th the, the, the support boat we're saying, you know, get out. You're not, you're not going to make, you're not gonna make it. And he just refused. And 23 hours. So you know, that's part of a night swim as well. Had out the water just all the way. Why Brandy? Is he getting fucked up or just a little bit of branding, you know, I don't know, maybe it might have been a bit of Dutch courage, but I think there was certainly back then sports nutrition isn't what it is today.

Speaker 1:          04:41          So I think there was an element, he was even like a lubing himself up in goose fat, you know, this is way back, make them soft, slicker, slicker. And I think there was an element of warmth for that was the, certainly the belief, right? So it was the Tour de France guys, didn't they drink wine? That was like a big thing back in the day. Way Back. Yeah. I mean it wasn't too long ago. Me and Jamie was just, just, just talking now about football back in England. And it wasn't till, you know too long ago, I don't, maybe a hundred years ago. They used to just keep brandy in the dressing room in case you needed to warm yourself up real and out. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. So they play soccer drunk there. Yeah. Kind of just slope with a little bit something. Exactly. All in turn it over.

Speaker 1:          05:22          Wow. Wow. And I think, you know, people don't understand that it's taken, you know, people like captain web maybe me to a smaller extent to just raise the bar, push the boundaries and, and you know, you've seen that I think our generation have seen that. Um, with the UFC, with mixed martial arts, that has evolved so fast. I'm always remember Forrest Griffin used to kind of a likened himself to the basketball players just shooting three pointers with the ball between the legs. And that always resonated with me because I was like, yeah, the evolution that we've seen and what sort of Bruce Lee had the foresight to predict is amazing. And I think in a, in a much, much, much smaller way, again, to go back to sort of British athletes and adventurers. Roger Bannister in a first night's wonder, a four minute mile and people said couldn't be done.

Speaker 1:          06:10          And he was a medical student at the time leading physicians that he can't do it. Your lungs will explode, your legs will fall off, all sorts. Um, but no, he says, you know, Oxford laced up his trainers and ran a four minute mile similar right now to what I think we're seeing with Kip Shogi, you know, and the two hour marathon. And so that's why, and again, in a much, much smaller way, when I had that conversation about swimming around Great Britain, everybody said it can't be done. Yes, it's 2000 miles. But there's giant whirlpools in Scotland's called the Chorea Vecan Penland firth renowned around the world. If you get that wrong, you'll disappear in backwards at 10 knots. You, there's no way you're swimming against that and 10 knots, that's a dolphin speed. She's, yeah. So what is 10 knots in miles per hour? Basically 10 miles per hour.

Speaker 1:          06:58          10 miles per hour backwards as you're trying to go forwards basically. Yeah. Penn inverse of the top of Scotland, the currents that go across there. So it's running at a good clip, but yo, yeah. Yeah. I mean we got it good. We, we, we managed to basically predict it so well that I, I think that was probably my top speed, which I did 8.7 knots. It's 8.7 miles per hour. I was basically cruising along the top, which is wow, was just like a dolphin. So you were having the waves behind you, pushing you almost. And see now that's what's interesting because I had the tides and currents with me, not necessarily the way I said it wrong and when you get bit, but actually you made a good point in terms of when you get Windover tide. So if you've got 10 knots going this way, but he even got a little bit of wind and waves going this way, it can get choppy again.

Speaker 1:          07:43          And again, sort of looking at west Scotland, Windover tide, you can get 40 knots coming straight down the barrel, but you're trying to swim with the tide. Yeah. The wind is coming at you, but the tide is going the opposite. And as you can imagine that, oh my God. Yeah. Yeah. So how do you predict this, this, this tide that you have to get right? Yeah, I mean, it's, it's in completely in theory. And this is what I realized when I sat down and we started sort of plotting the great, what does this called again? What is the issue that will push you back? Oh, just the title. Yes. What is it called? That area. Oh, you say you got to get right. Oh, so Penn Unferth pending earth or the panel and for Pendleton for, yeah. Yeah. And that's that, like I said, renowned around the world.

Speaker 1:          08:30          But, but equally, if you imagine the shape of Great Britain, there's all sorts of kind of compression where the water would just come rushing through. And as well as the panel and firth, you can get, you know, six knots around whales. There's an island called Scoma. And if you get that right, you are disappearing, you know, and you're winning, you get it wrong again, you're going backwards. And for mile, for me to do a continuous stage swim, if I'm going backwards, I've got to start where I was going backwards. So for me, getting every single tied right. And that's while so for the team were amazing. There was uh, uh, the Captain Matt was just incredible that every night the homework, are we okay here? No. Do we crash? All right folks, if you're listening or watching, we had a little technical difficulty, so this is not streaming live will be uploaded later.

Speaker 1:          09:19          We were just going over how you predicted you had to end, your team had to predict how the tide was coming because if it went wrong you'd get pushed backwards at like 10 miles an hour. Yeah. Basically. And the, and this is the thing, I think with the great British swim, we were kind of taking swimming as most people understand it and we were, we were removing it and putting it in an arena that was so different. So I think that's why it was, it did so well kind of online as well as the community around it because obviously swimmers were interested, but you know, surface started to get involved because they understood the waves. Um, sailors, fisherman, you know, all sorts of people started to say, you know, sometimes in Great Britain it's not safe to take a boat around the top of Scotland in it, for instance, nevermind a swimmer.

Speaker 1:          10:04          Um, so that's, that's why it was amazing that, that on the entire series it became, uh, a melting pot and exchange of ideas because nobody knew how to get a human body around the coast of Great Britain. It wasn't just about swimming and, and that was what was really cool. How do, how do they know, like when the tides are going one way or the other, how do they predict that tied to so predictable? So in theory, they change every six hours. So in theory, when we sat down and we looked, and we know that if you do six hours on six hours off for 157 days, you'll make it around the coast of Great Britain. You know? And, and, and that was the theory. So you do this by phasic sleep and you swim for 12 hours a day. But that's all theory. There's times when, as I mentioned, a giant whirlpools or, or the tides might not necessarily, if you imagine sort of that's Great Britain there the tides out necessarily go always like this or they're not that predictable.

Speaker 1:          10:59          Sometimes if there's kind of like this, like that's kind of whales, they're the tides will do this. So you're doing all these different things that people are not going to see instead of listening to it on audio. So just try to just describe it. Right. It's a basically rather than the is just going up and down and working with you. Sometimes they cross cross. Yeah. So you'll just kind of getting slapped across the face. My tides essentially. And it's not just helping you, you're going to basically zigzag all the way up the coast of Great Britain. So it was predictable as tides are. We found those so much stuff that when we're out there we were like, oh, it wasn't meant to do that. Or a giant whirlpool wasn't meant to be there, you know? But it is an, and that was what was pretty, yeah, pretty sketchy.

Speaker 1:          11:43          It, sometimes you need that when we were out there, if it whirlpool just decides to appear. You've got you, there's not really enough time to say, oh hang on, that wasn't on the map. Can we look at that? Can we speak to the Met Office and talk about, you know, weather reports? No, you just, you, I've had to swim through it or try and get out there as quick as you could. So when you encounter something like that and you get stuck, do you pull out of the water and try back again later at the same location? You do. But quite often if it was there, it's still going to be there. So it's just, it is what it is. Yeah. So sometimes there's this notion and perhaps the best example of this, um, I mentioned for, it's called the Chorea Vecan. So, uh, sort of west coast of Scotland and it's a giant whirlpool.

Speaker 1:          12:23          And, and Matt, the captain turned to me and said, look Ross, you know, I need you to swim and I need you to swim hard. You know, you need to spend six hours. You just need to be clear of this whirlpool. Um, so as we were swimming past it, I set my watch and some hard for six hours, but about three hours in, um, I got stung by jellyfish and I've been stung by jellyfish a lot before. He's just, you know, it's painful, but it was, it was bearable. Um, but this one particular jellyfish, it just, it was searing into my skin. It just, it wouldn't stop throbbing. And so I carried on swimming, three hours passed and it was just unbearable. So I popped my head up and I looked at Matt, the captain from the boat. I said, ma'am, I'm so sorry I've been stung.

Speaker 1:          13:00          You know, I'm going to have to stop. Um, I've been stung by jellyfish pitch. The pain's just not going away. And as, as I said that to him, he looked down at me and he said, yeah, I know, cause the tentacles still wrapped around your face. So I'd basically been swimming for three hours with a jellyfish on your case, wearing a jellyfish. It wrapped into my goggles. So I took my gold unpeeled this fat tentacle threw it away. Um, and then like I said, I'll show you in a minute. I'll ever, there was a picture where my, my face sorta change shape and the goggles wouldn't fit on my face anymore because my eye sockets were so swelled. Um, but I knew that again, for all of this happening, the Cory of Eq and the giant Walpole was still to my left. So Matt was like, you still need to swim.

Speaker 1:          13:43          You still need to sue them. So I ended up paying the goggles over my face and to try and get them to seal, I just punched them into my face. So you just had these perfect ring and then I managed, you're sore. Swollen. Yeah. So you're a push them through the swelling basically. Yeah. John. So you swim. Um, I made another hour. We got clear the Cory of Atkins. We managed to clear this giant whirlpool. I collapse onto the boat and, um, and this is the thing, it was at that point that I collapsed exhausted face. Now a different shape to when I started that particular swim. And, um, and the team looked at me and they saw how bad I was, how being an upper was, but they also knew that, that the sea just doesn't care. And in six hours the tide was going to change and I'm not going to have to do that all over again.

Speaker 1:          14:27          And it was that kind of brutal lesson from nature that, that from a sports science background, I'm interested in, you know, Rehab, rest, recovery, nutrition strategies, all of this. But with swimming around Great Britain, it very quickly became apparent that the sea just doesn't care. It just doesn't care that you need to rehab your shoulders. It doesn't care that the ligaments and tendons in your shoulders are hurting. You might get impingement from swimming too much in none of this. And that's why it went from swimming as I understood it and how a lot of people understand it to something completely like surviving basically in the water. So you're swimming schedule would be six hours on and then you would try to rest. When would you eat, uh, during the swims or, or between Erin? The swims? Yeah. Yes. Uh, quite often just, you know, throwing bananas at me and just multi bananas basically.

Speaker 1:          15:21          Yeah. Yeah. Just so deep and I need to eat. And while you're in the water. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Cause cause again going back to what we were talking about with the pen and firth, you could get out and you could get on the boat, but sometimes in a really good tide, if you are just in the water, you could be making four knots. You don't have to swim. But if you get in the freezing cold water Scotland and you are quite happy to getting hit in the face by 10th cause you can still make four knots. And so that's why so often it became about something different than swimming. It was just, it was just mental for tutors, physical fortitude. It was um, basically, I always remember actually the first day of autumn, um, I got up, it was two o'clock, so it was a nighttime, two o'clock in the morning and I left my wetsuit out to dry and I had to scrape.

Speaker 1:          16:08          It's just a thin layer of ice off the wet wetsuit before I could fit it. But if I didn't, if I didn't get in and I didn't spray it that, that, that way, then that would have been, you know, 15 miles potentially that we would have missed out on. And if you miss those 15 miles, that the window of opportunity to swim around Great Britain because of the British summer being notoriously unpredictable and quite short. Um, we wouldn't have made it round because even towards the end there was two storms, a store Mallarme and storm Cali Allien Callum, who kind of stopped us for those two days where we couldn't swim because you just couldn't swim in a storm. It wasn't safe. So when you were swimming, this was all during the summer? Yeah, yeah. Uh, for the autumn. And then we finished November the fourth, which was going into the winter as well. And you started what month? Uh, June. The first. So for, since June you've been swimming? Yeah, basically. God Damn Man.
