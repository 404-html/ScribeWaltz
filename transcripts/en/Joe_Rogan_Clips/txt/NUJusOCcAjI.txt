Speaker 1:          00:00          I mean, and I, I look at this say cause I've worked with uh, with mark the Khasi. Casey. Yeah. Physically. I mean just God given abilities, but he just doesn't have the intelligence to make all that shit work. He's screaming at the TV right now, you know. I know. And I say that I say that I, and I say that with all due respect because he's my main guy, isn't he a young guy? Mark? Yeah. He's, I mean early to mid twenties. Yeah. Maybe just trying to figure it out. Yeah. And that's what it is. He's trying to figure it out and it kind of pushed him a little fast. So he didn't have a, you know, a lot, a ton of shit. Ones have some Edsons had some ups and downs. Cowboy fire was a big down, I mean he's had, could be pipe, it was a big down, oh yeah, that was terrifying.

Speaker 1:          00:44          Fight doesn't even realize how God could, could be Biz. Oh, I know. Yeah. That was like, that's the fight that like put Khabib on the map really for everybody to say, Matt, who's going to beat this guy? And what he did to him. Who's going to beat this guy. Yeah. But that's what I've always said is that like if you had to pick like one thing that you're good at, like what's the most important thing? It seems to me to be wrestling because the wrestlers can just, if you get a like a real high level wrestler, they just dictate what happens. They dictate where the fight takes place. I don't think there is, I mean you have to know how to strike. You have to know the other things as well, but it feels like if you have a pyramid of shit that's important, it feels like at the bottom is wrestling and that motherfucker wrestles better than anybody in that division.

Speaker 1:          01:27          Yeah. I mean, but see, I disagree kind of. Okay. And here's why. Um, I don't necessarily, because when we talk about wrestling, I don't think it's necessarily the techniques of restaurant. I think it's just a waiter brought up, they're brought up different in Pakistan, not, not only daggers, they're definitely brought up differently, but like any wrestlers just brought up different, oh, toughness. A different level of toughness, a different level, a level of competitiveness. So like when you go to Jujitsu school was first thing you learn how to do his bowel to Matt and kissed the instructors ass. That's it. You know you bout to Matt and and you're learning self defense and you learn to respect and wrestling. It's not about that, it's about dominate. It's about winning and dominating. So they have years of experience of doing that. Like just that mindset. It's also about being uncomfortable all the time and it's like it or just the room is always rough.

Speaker 1:          02:16          It's always tough. Like you go to a Jujitsu school, it's a bunch of dudes smoking pot, land back. They roll five minutes, sit back, smoke for 30 role, another five minutes you go to a wrestling room is hot, sweaty, they're all uncomfortable or all grinding. So you take that guy and you teach them some basic Jujitsu. You got a champ. Yeah. Hey that this is the mindset for me. Physical Strength, physical strength, the grip strength. I guess so important. Like for me, like grips is everything and in wrestling you learn a lot of that early. So I feel like, um, that's kind of the different searches brought up different, yeah, I definitely think there's something to that. And then also being able to cut weight and still compete. Yeah, I mean, so I'm always my fighters now. Like when you have that restaurant, his parents basically, if you wrestled in college, like you go all your high school years, you got 50 matches a year, so you competing 200 times before you even graduate high school and then you go to college.

Speaker 1:          03:14          If you wrestle in college, you compete against the best of the best in the best room and then you fight MMA is nothing, there's nothing to you and now you, and then you take a kid off the street who's never competed before, they're nervous, they don't perform well there always at a disadvantage. And as somebody who wrestled, right, because of the experiencing competition. Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. The only thing about some wrestlers because of the, like, there's like a tightness to wrestling and some wrestlers just never learned how to be loose with Ca. And some, some pick it up quick. It's weird what s the difference. And that's what makes some of them better than the other ones. When I look at, you know, obviously Tyron Woodley, he's got it. He's loose. He's got it. Yeah. Michael Chandler, when he throw his right hand, it's loose.

Speaker 1:          03:59          Yeah. Yeah. Uh, but you're right. Some of them just can't get it. And that's why they struggle. And they struggle if they fight a wrestler who can strike. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It's terrifying for a wrestler who can't strike to fight a wrestler who can strike is terrifying. Oh yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Some dude who can keep it standing and can fuck you up special. They can kick too. I know. I know. But that, but I think that's another problem with wrestlers. They fall in love with the striking earliest Jujitsu guys too. Yeah. Yeah. And that's, and that's, and, and that's what messes him up, man. He Fall in love with it and think, oh, I have to be well rounded, so I have to dedicate all my time to doing this. And I'm like, man, but you getting worse at what you're good at. Why used to watch the George group Shell fight? I'm like, if you watch that guy fight, you never know that he was a Brazilian jujitsu black belt. Come man. I used to get so mad at him. I'm like, dude, what are you doing? What are you doing? Like he, yeah. I don't know if it was like fan expectation or just like in his mind he wanted to be a striker, but.
