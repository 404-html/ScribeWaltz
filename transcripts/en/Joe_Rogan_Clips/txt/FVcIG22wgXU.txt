Speaker 1:          00:00          Hold on, hold on. Hold. Parties basically pushed him hard. Listen to him. There's not a part of you that respected the Conor McGregor dare compare yourself. Total agreements makes martial arts, you know of all time, part of the entire nation. You know Conor Mcgregor, you know how many [inaudible] you and can I ask whoever the fuck is in Ireland? What? Connor would love bird fucking if you said Connor, you got one hour to party with one guy hanging out with one guy. He's picking on me Bro. I talked shit might ask me advice. I would like to talk to him about his future. I have some thoughts. I want him on your podcast so bad man. I love that. I don't know. We were supposed to do it a long time ago. I had his trained around really recently. You know, I hope he doesn't think that in any way that I, I don't respect him or appreciate him because fighters are like super, super sensitive.

Speaker 1:          01:06          Like I've gone through that a few times. Like I called Tony Ferguson who's like one of my all time favorite. Literally one of my all time favorite fighters. I said he was a brilliant Weirdo because he wears like ankle weights. He got mad at me, he got upset and I had to talk to him and I like try to sort it out. I did it through someone else and I was like, no, no, no, no, no, no. He seems like that. It seems like that, but what it is is so exposed. It's what you're doing is so personal. It's so insane that you like what we can brush off. It's way harder for them. Will you? If you lose a fight and someone disrespects you or they in public sentiment keeps you from getting a title shot, I guess that's a significant part of their life.

Speaker 1:          01:54          They're not used to dealing with public reaction. They used to dealing with his competition. Right, so the public reaction thing of celebrity, it's an afterthought. It's something an after effect of competition, right? You become successful and then you have to deal with all these people around you that want you to dance. Well, Conor Mcgregor's in natural shit talker. He's a great fighter, but he's also a natural shit talker. You want a buffalo bar? Yeah, Dude. That's what I love about Conor Mcgregor. Conor Mcgregor, Bernie Sanders on, it's a weird situation that you haven't had either one of those people along. I tried to get Bernie recently. He said no, some fake Bernie contacted us. Oh, you say you got your head right? Yeah, that was had they got me and I said, I'm a big fan of, I like a lot of your ideas. I'd love to have you on.

Speaker 1:          02:37          And then it was here though. I don't think he wants to run for president, man. Why would he still come on? I don't know. I don't know man. You know what I fucking love by the way about Conor McGregor is that he meets, he made me really appreciate the athlete. Who knows they're also an entertainer. Yeah. I actually, you know, there's, there's people that did that like, I mean everyone would probably give, I'll leave credit to me why it works. I don't know why it works. I mean that's who he is. He is, that guy will be talking shit and sparring. Just guys that are just funny. Locked on him is fantastic. And he's smoking weed and Mike Tyson, by the way, Mike Tyson owns a god damn weed farm. What does it call him down? Yeah. What is it called? Jamie? Make that smaller please. So we could read what the Hashtag is. Um, used to have, God damn, they used to say something about Tyson something or another. Did they edit it?
