Speaker 1:          00:00          Clinical trials. Yeah, just in clinical. That's right. That's right. Now wasn't there a Lyme disease vaccine? But the problem was it was actually causing people to get Lyme disease. So that's a talk about controversial topics. So there was a Lyme disease vaccine that was developed, uh, actually from a colleague of mine at Yale University than it was, and they licensed it, I think it was to Glaxo Smith Kline and they developed it as a, they called it lime rex. It was a, the Lyme disease vaccine. And actually most of the studies suggest that actually worked pretty well. Uh, the problem was there were a number of people who felt that the vaccine made them worse, or they said they had chronic Lyme disease, that it wasn't effective. So it was really a market perception problem more than anything else. And ultimately, uh, it hurt the bottom line of the company and they, they withdrew it from the market.

Speaker 1:          00:48          Friend of Mine's Dad got the vaccine and then got Lyme disease. They think he got Lyme disease from the vaccine. Probably not. Probably is a weird word. When someone with Lyme disease that's being nice. No, he didn't get Lyme disease. Impossible. Impossible. Cause Lyme disease is caused by the Lyme bacteria, the spiral [inaudible] called Barellia Burgdorferi. And the vaccine is not a live vaccine. It's a recombinant protein based vaccine. So it's not. So there's nothing in that vaccine that could've caused this adverse reaction that they directly attribute to that vaccine? Probably not. That's what you're saying. Well I don't know the patient. I don't, I haven't examined the intimacy. I hate taste swear. I mean that's the narrative that household, well again, you know what's reinforced by a lot of negative information out there on the Internet. It's also reinforced by the fact they pulled the vaccine.

Speaker 1:          01:39          Yup. Well they pulled the vaccine not because it wasn't working, but because of market perception and and all that sort of, and that was a time before the number of cases of Lyme disease have really taken off. So strange to me because they didn't pull the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine because of perception. Why would they pull the Lyme disease vaccine? Because of perception. I think the reason was is because, um, the, the cost benefit equation works a little differently. Um, with measles. Measles is a killer disease. Lyme disease was not a killer disease. And people now in some cases it seems to be, uh, connected to a host of other ailments to correct like Lyme disease. It just exacerbates a bunch of different maybe, possibly even existing health issues. Well, you have to be careful, you know, the, the, and this gets into another controversial rabbit hole.

Speaker 1:          02:33          I'm not sure we want to get into or not today, but, um, you know, the Infectious Disease Society of America for instance, has come out with a strong statement saying that there's really no such thing as chronic Lyme disease. And, um, the scientific evidence does not support something called chronic Lyme disease. Yet there are lots of people suffering with chronic debilitating illness who claimed that it's caused by Lyme disease. So this is something that, um, is out there right now. Why is there a debate like what is, what, why are they saying that there is no such thing as chronic Lyme disease? What's their evidence? The evidence is that there's no evidence that they can detect spiral Keats in the body in many cases, uh, uh, people who have had Lyme disease don't have persistent evidence of having a antibodies any longer to, to the [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          03:25          So, um, it's a whole different area, right? But they do have this chronic inflammation and pain in their joints. They have, somebody starts breaking down, they have something, but it doesn't seem to the Infectious Disease Society of America, uh, which is one of the leading infectious disease bodies and our country. And I'm not an expert on Lyme disease, so I'm not too comfortable going there with you are saying that there's no evidence that, uh, that that's actually associated with active infection with Lyme disease. And what are they, how are they describing it and what, how are they, so in other words, we'll, so what's causing all the decent unknown unknown. I know, but isn't it bizarre that these same people got Lyme disease first? And then how about these host of issues afterwards? Well, the, I guess part of the problem is in some cases they had Lyme disease first. And in some cases they really didn't have Lyme disease. Unfortunately, there are a number of unscrupulous healthcare providers and even physicians out there that are making the misdiagnosis. Either they're making a misdiagnosis of Lyme disease, or in some cases, they're actually taking everyone who comes through the door and diagnosing them with Lyme disease. I'm sure you're aware of the lone star tick, the allergy to red meat. Yeah. Right. That's really fascinating.
