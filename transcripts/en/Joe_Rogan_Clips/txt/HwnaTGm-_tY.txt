Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience that you think, why am I asking you this? But I think you might have an answer. So, but I'm being totally honest, I am exhausted from dealing with like I, it's, it's not like it's a big deal, but it's like the first time you, whether you can admit major things in your life, like, oh, I have a drinking problem, but to be stupid little things. Yeah, mine is eating. Like I'm exhausted from doing it the wrong way and everything comes back to me for self control. So when people want to tell me about a diet, I don't, it's not portions. I know a portions are, I just want to eat more. So it's all down to how do I fucking get self control? I have zero. I mean if I'm not going to call it zero self control, then I don't know what the hell I'm going to call it.

Speaker 1:          00:41          But as you now you're, you're not, you're hard on yourself. I think you have self control. Todd think you're a wonderful man, but you're, you're hilarious. And one of the reasons why you're hilarious is because you're so, you're free, you're impulsive and that sort of debt, it's very difficult for that to lend itself to dietary discipline. It's like, how can I eat it? Fuck it. Hey, that's a fucking eat it. Right. That's you. But it's also part of what makes you such a hilarious comic. It's like you have these impulses. It makes me feel better. You don't want to split the difference, at least with what you're saying, discomfort and you want to have fun and it's like it's right there that want he, I want to eat that food. Fuck it. The thought of me like picture me at the, at the uh, shoving cheesecake, him in my mouth and my friends are like looking at me like Todd and I go,

Speaker 2:          01:28          Joe Rogan said that because I'm creative. Good. I should eat whatever I want. He said it and you can go listen to his podcast. He said that I should eat. He goes, Joe Rogan and you can go listen. He said, clear up the minibar before you get in your hotel beds. Even, even if you're not really hungry, does some creative, okay, so I don't have control over this.

Speaker 1:          01:53          There's also a problem. There's another problem with discipline. This is a pro and disciplining that hit me already. Yeah, for sure. No, that's probably just the we'd hit yet. It takes a little while for the spray again. Yeah, usually a few more minutes than that. Um, I forgot my point about, um, the self control. Oh, that when you really disciplined people and comedy, they don't go well together that much either. Because if you're too driven and too disciplining, that's almost always Dickey. You know what I mean? I'm saying like you'd be able to disciplined, too rigid, too determined and, and, and, and to like too enthusiastic about success. You get Dickie, let me ask you this and I'm not, I don't, this thought could be wrong. Like I'm okay with thinking something and then maybe finding out. But whenever it comedian, and I bet there's funny ones out there.

Speaker 1:          02:51          Definitely. Cause over the years I remember my, can't think of which ones, but they definitely exist. They are funny, they are funny, but they've never smoked. Drank, oh, can you be a good comedian if you haven't done those things, I think you'd be a good comedian. If you're a man, you could be a good comedian. If you're a woman, you could be a good comedian. If you're gay or trans, you just, you are a good comedian. If you're a good comedian. Is that, why do I ask that? Because I'm, I should be embarrassed to ask that too, is a lot of people that are really good that don't do shit and never, yeah, they don't, they don't have a desire to, you know, it's just everybody's brain works different. And some people like the idea of losing control with a substance is not not fun. Right.

Speaker 1:          03:36          They don't like that feeling and it's, but they can keep their shit together, you know? I know a lot of people that don't drink, they don't do anything, but they keep their shit together and maybe that's better for them. They feel like it is. I don't know. I, you know, I, as I asked that you gave me the answer that you know to go, you're right. You're right. Yeah. But like I s it means that I had a question about that and I, and that I think I've talked about this in the past and once I was like, somebody was saying, well, they may be, what if you're not experimenting? But no, there's a billion ways to, uh, to do those things that you use pot to do without the pod. Obvious. I think I, you edit that out. I use yoga for that too, man. I love going to a hot yoga class fucking hard. And it's like a drug, like you get a lot of thinking done in there, man, when you're just holding these poses and there's no, no music, no nothing, just everybody in the class. Breathing is a 90 minute class. There's some sort of psychedelic effect there.

Speaker 3:          04:38          Okay.
