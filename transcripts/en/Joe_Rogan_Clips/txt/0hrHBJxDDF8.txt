Speaker 1:          00:00          When you, uh, set out to do trigger warning, what did, what was the, what was the initial premise and how much of it did it change until when you need, once you got to production and once you started filming one of the only people who have asked that question, you can look, this isn't a sparrow. Yeah. Straight up bro. Yeah. Originally we shot it with FX and we over we over did it. It looked really good, but it looked really TV. Uh, and um, it could have been dealt, but it would have been a parity of a very real thing I was tempted to do. And right now I'm talking to my crib. Nicola, what it turned out at, turned into at Netflix was a real

Speaker 2:          00:39          mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:42          In your face. Simple and plainly shot

Speaker 1:          00:47          documentation of the possibilities of barbershop arguments. Right? So in a barbershop argument, you get to say, you know, the only thing that separates alcohol from Joe Kennedy is Al Capone got caught and eventually died in prison. And Joe Kennedy went on to produce presidents, but they both had been bootlegged, you know, people say Shit like it's barbershop talk and you need, you have to go home and be like yourself. Like, well, well damn, if Papa Joe did it was a bootlegger. Like technically it could have went fucked up for him and we never would have had an American dynasty versus owl catching Sibley's in shit and it not going so well. But him being the preeminent marketing campaign in face of any Capone like thing, you want to sell cigars to a restaurant, right? So it got it. I got a chance to say, you know, Shit, what if I could do this for my guys?

Speaker 1:          01:33          And again, giving it a shot and giving them to try it. I thought of that shit at 15 years old, I started trying to figure out how to do it 10 years ago, Daniel and I got it done eight, nine years later. And now you have this. And, and I say that just to say that I read Brian Koppelman and the creator of billions, um, is a brilliant writer to me. And he's a phrase a friend also, but Brian has been putting up lately these just encouraging things, telling writers to write, even if your stuff is getting body, even if you don't think is good to write, to to push yourself to push the idea forward. And I've been taking a lot of inspiration for that because Daniel Daniel Minefield and I wanted a co writer who's in cocreators. Daniel and I have been talking and developing this over 10 years now.

Speaker 1:          02:19          I know how to do it, how to go on a room, how to get it, you know, it won't take me 10 years for the next one, but it was worth the struggle, you know, it was worth doing that. It was worth tweaking. My ideal is worth critiquing my idea to be like the first time around like nine. It's not, it's not what it should be because I was nervous as shit the night before it came out about everything in it. You know what scenes were shot, how did it look to production value and now seeing people get it and unlike a lot of other artists, not have to call yourself a genius. Let me tell people's, like every artist thinks days it changes. Every comedian thinks they're fucking Richard Pryor and some part of your mind, you have to think you're great or why do it?

Speaker 1:          02:58          You have believe there's greatness in you. Right? But I'd never want it to be the guy. I'm a fucking genius. You know what I mean? I just never want it. But to see it, because I always thought the idea was genius. Like fuck that shit. You remember real people that used to come on in the seventies eighties I remember watching that show as a kid looking at motherfuckers like, wow, these motherfuckers exist in it and he's off far off places like Iowa and Kansas and I wanted to approach it. I wanted to approach people in a very, I'm here right in front of you, kind of way. Not Above you, not celebrity, Michael Morris. The people know I'm a rapper and it gave me that opportunity and people can say as genius and I'm going to say I'm humbled and honored but you're fucking right and it's genius because I'm engaging people at a regular human level, not at the level of celebrity or power.

Speaker 1:          03:44          There used to be an engaged but one that allows them to fully open up. I haven't seen it on TV since. Some shit like real people or no, I haven't seen revolutionary TV like the Jeffersons or you know all in the family or mod and I think that the world is getting scary and pussy to be honest. You know, not to, not to disrespect pussies cause pussies are tough but I think that something needs to be dangerous. The best compliment I got on this press run has been like Ambrosia Ambrosia for head said. How's it feel to have some most dangerous show on TV and it's dangerous because it unites people. Does it separate people? It gives you alternative answers and the ones you thought you had, it forces you to think it doesn't solve all the problems or wrap it up pretty at the end.

Speaker 1:          04:27          Gives you some options to do and some shit to think about. And it's funny as fuck. And so first if in dark and I like it. I was, I got an imagine Netflix give you plenty of room. Yeah. Hell they weren't tripping man. They don't trip. Don't trip. Just go. You know what you're doing. Go ahead. Yeah, exactly. And then you walk in the room like how the fuck I'm doing. But there is smart enough to let people create their own shit for standup comedy. There's no one better in terms of like interacting with them about a special, you don't have to give them any notes on the material. They, they know that you're going to do your best. I stope yeah, they don't stop. They can't help you. Like no one can help you as a comic. There's a another person, like an executive is going to help you do your best.

Speaker 1:          05:09          You gotta you gotta be looking at it yourself ruthlessly and you'll figure it out. And so they trust you. So I would assume they did the same thing with you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Perfect. Beautiful. All right. What a world. Yeah, the forever the, it was the opposite. There was 50 fucking cooks in the kitchen and everybody's pulling you this way and you need to do what to do. It's just shit. You need a fucking theme song. You got, you need a thing. You say every week, which you talk about Willis, you need to hook. Everybody needed a hook. Oh Shit. She said, oh my God. Shouts it different strokes.
