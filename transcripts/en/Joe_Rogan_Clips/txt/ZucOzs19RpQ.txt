Speaker 1:          00:00          It's good that you think like this because clearly you're a very confident guy and you're obviously successful and your mixed martial arts career. But to have just a little bit of that insecurity is fuel. It's just like it keeps you sharp. It keeps you aware. You know, like to be confident is good. To be delusional is terrible. Yeah. 100% of terrible. Everybody knows that one guy that thinks he can beat a guy that he's not ever going to fucking be able to be. You know? I mean there's a lot of people like give me that fight you, hey wait, that's why you don't see, you know, you never see me say some outlandish shit. Like oh I can't never be beat know or oh I can go out there and you know our bar Cain Velasquez or something like that. I mean not meaning to pick on Rhonda, but I know he was saying, yeah but you know.

Speaker 1:          00:48          But I think you know, the Rhonda thing, it was, there was a lot going on there man. Coaching wise, there's a lot going on there. What? She just came along at a time when there was no one like her when she was a real Olympic caliber athlete and her judo was at such a high level. No one could fuck with him throwing people around until someone could fuck with her until she ran into someone like Holly Holm. And then then we really saw the holes in the preparation, the distractions, the fact that she had, you know, movie deals going on. They wanted her to do road house and she's scripts and this and agent meetings and all the bullshit man. It's like a fucking Hollywood. It was like a Hollywood script. Like this is what happens to you and this is how rocky when rocky went soft, I mean this is literally what happens and then all of a sudden you've got this bad ass Holly Holm sitting there ready to fucking head kick you into another dimension.

Speaker 1:          01:44          And that's what happened. And like you said, I think, I think most of it is just trying to stay aware and I get the delusional about it cause it's, it is very easy to kind of slip into that and fall into that and you know, sometimes she will hit you. And that's what happened in my, in my second fight that I lost, uh, to, to Leonardo Santos and, and, and each fight I can always see myself losing, you know, and people ask me that and they were like, you talk about all this visualization that you do. Like sometimes I visualize myself getting hurt too and fights. Do you do that to see how you recover? How do you, what do you do? So it's not a new experience. I Went Barboza fucking spinning heel kicks me in the head like his, it's not, uh, it's not, it's always the punch that don't hurt you. We were texted texting before that fight and we were setting up this podcast. You. I just listen. I just got to concentrate on making sure I do. Don't kick me in the head and then after the fight like, Damn, you fucking kicked me in the head.

Speaker 1:          02:41          You are definitely, definitely preparing yourself for the possibility.
