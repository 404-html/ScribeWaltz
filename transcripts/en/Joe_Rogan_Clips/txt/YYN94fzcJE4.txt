Speaker 1:          00:00          Ages and what I like about him do we stand for the same thing, Eh, then I stand for, for against the performance enhancing drug. And I think is very important for me. And it, for me it was that cannot honor to fighting him. It was like a lot of guy he lost to this guy that they would have been cut on performance enhancing drugs and, and um, he's very open. He talks about it all the time and then I think is great. Great model for this part. Yeah, I know, I agree. I agree. And a great model for, it's just an example of how you can achieve great things if you work hard. And that's what he's done is he's one of that guy that like, I hate him when I wasn't trying again, but I loved them as well. And the same, same time.

Speaker 1:          00:43          I remember at one point I want to point where in a conference in Toronto and that is it. And the larger story, I've thought a conference, we go by the bag, kind of the back door of a mall. And um, there's like a, I don't know if it's a, it was staged or not. I've, I mean, I'm not aware if it was stage, I wasn't that aware of it. So there's a camera, like I think he's said was TMZ or something. It was a camera that follow. So there were kids following us too. They're about to ask us. The, asked me to take pictures and then I say camera coming towards me. And then that's Michael. That's after the, the governance and Michael the system using, they'll let you f book, you're an on me again because then, and then, uh, then I look in his face and I was like, what as I do it, I'll put you back.

Speaker 1:          01:32          And then he create, create kind of a buzz word, a fight, and we start to shout at each other and it kind of almost pushed each other. I'm Jason [inaudible] boys leave it fortified. Boy, that is so, but it's, it's not staged. It's true. Now I'm like, man, what the hell? He is doing there, but then after I realize it go, it was on TMZ where I come out right there. Then they kids, they came through asking me for another graph. They can, they can. They kind of get a intimidating, they were like, they went back. Then I turned around, I was like, it's okay. It's Spanish and all you can come in and go. They get, when they went back to their, I read, I'm like, Oh God, what? It is what it is, you know? But that was probably the best promotion of the old fight, like that particular as an incident, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          02:18          So I hate him and I love him the same way. Michael just kind of a guidance. He's, he's a pro at at boosting the anticipation for a fight hype. You want to hate them, but you kind of love him. And then the same way for the human being that he is, you know? No, he's great to talk and shit for sure. Yeah. That is a big thing these days. I mean, especially after Connor, Connor Mcgregor has kind of changed the sport and a lot of ways and that there, that shit talking is a, it's a huge factor now. It is, but sometimes you don't know when is really when it's not because I'm not, it's not part of my personality. And same thing at the Espn in Boston, same thing. We do an interview, we go back and forth, Blah Blah Blah. I kind of almost insulting each other.

Speaker 1:          03:03          So resource me. Then, uh, the UFC does everything to separate us for me, one of each other. Like I'm like, I don't know if it's real or not. I don't even know if he's trying to push my, I gotta push him back cause I feel, I felt threatened thing. So you don't know if it's hype or myself because I'm not an instigator. I don't like golf rotation, but it is what it is. So I go to the bathroom in between. Who comes next to the bathroom with us? It's by code base back then. Is that Camaro that Paula was in a bathroom. I'm, we're taking a piss now. Next to each other. We're like this. Then I see Michael Bizarre, like, oh, this shit. Then the camera at any telecom area, two to f out is, I get out, the number camera goes out. They need, look at me, look at him. Then he started laughing, then started laughing.

Speaker 1:          03:50          Then I told him, I said, hey, you get a range rover? He's like, yeah, but now he's in the garage. I'm like, yeah, it's a, you need to get rid of it because after a while it does start breaking down is I? Yeah. You know, it was, I came game phase two later on. Do you want to hate that guy like this? You know what I mean? Oh, that's hilarious. But I hate him because when we, we insult each other, we say real and salt and real things that we think about each other, but in a, in a way we have the respect. Yeah. So it's really, but so with that relationship that I have with Bisping was very unique. I didn't have the same relationship with Diaz, for example, Diaz. I didn't know if like if I meet him, him even industry too, they may be hates my guts.

Speaker 1:          04:33          Like I don't know what he's going to write. I don't know if he wanted to fight me or he might really want to fight you, but he's not a hype guy. I think he's, I think he takes it personal and I think he, it's, man, it's a freakin spark man is more to life than what it is. It was a are fighting his might now, man, fighting is not my life, man. My life is my family. Man is, is my friend. The people I love. This is what I do in my life is not my life. I need, the fighting is over. It's over. I turned around and do something else. You know what I mean? Like is what I do in my life, some of my life. You know what I mean?
