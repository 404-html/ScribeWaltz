Speaker 1:          00:00          It's one of those things like the walking on coals to absolutely. I've done a number of times, I'm sure, but if you, as long as it's cold, you know this then that Coles are not a very good conductor of heat, which is why you don't Cook on Friday. She took on that bullshit. Be caught. Yes. I'll tell you what my experience was. I, the first time I tried it, uh, I was with a group of maybe 40 people and it was a, the standard length of the walk was about 12 feet. It was a hot fire was mesquite and it was in my yard in Tucson. And the guy came in, it was early in the days of firewalking and he had this long four hour thing to get people ready. Uh, I was not in the right mental state when I did it. And my experience was it felt fucking hot.

Speaker 1:          00:43          And, and when it got to the end of it, the, it condensed down to like a number of points that really burned. And I had blisters the next day. And most people that have walked that night, it looked like they were not in the right mental state. But I saw a few people who strolled across it that looked, they were in some interesting altered state. So I wanted to try it again next time I did it, I shouldn't have done it. I was with a guy who was a real jerk who thought himself as a, you know, he's a self styled guru, small group. It was a shorter maybe eight foot cooler bed of coals and I got significant burns from that. So like an annoying guru. So it's really annoying saying no idea what she'll still idea what he was doing. Like this guy's a jerk off and then you're getting annoyed so you're out of your mindset.

Speaker 1:          01:25          Right. And I burned my feet so I said I'm not going to do this again. And then a friend of mine was doing some intensive workshop with Tony Robbins and so Christ and it was going to end the last day. They were going to do try to set a record for the longest firewalk done in America. So he wanted me to come up. So I went up there, I thought, I'm going to watch, I'm not going to do it. So it was a 40 foot bed of coals and it was a really odd, and he had like a troupe of African drummers and people are dancing and drumming. It was like midnight and people were getting in line to walk and I said, I'm not going to do this and I can be by family self, you know, going up there. And I was right there and he taps me on the shoulder and says, you're ready.

Speaker 1:          02:01          It felt like walking through crunchy croutons. There was no sensation of heat. I walked slowly. I kind of wiggled my feet and the things and when I got to the end of it, I felt so high. It was like on acid. I had energy rushes through my body. I had nothing on my feet. So on a much shorter cooler walk, those coals conducted just fine. And uh, you know, when this one, it's a mind body thing. It's not about the connectivity of the coal. Tony Robbins hitting you with some fun gazey, Kohl's. It was hot. I mean you could barely get at the edge of the thing. Men, the heat was amazing. You know the Tony Robbins one, it's what's really interesting is recently they've developed this issue with people trying to take selfies while they're walking across the coals burning their feet. It's become a significant issue because it didn't happen till like within the last one.

Speaker 1:          02:51          I've never heard of that. I think that would get you right out of the proper state. Yeah, there was a big article about it that's pretty big article about these people really their feet up a well deserved. You really think that you have the ability to mitigate the amount of effect that fire and Cole hot coals. I don't have any proof of, this is my intuition. I think what happens if your mind is out of the way you can take, you can absorb energy and let it flow through your body rather than getting blocked in the tissues where it causes damage. And I've seen this in other situations as well and I think the problem is ordinarily our mind is in the way of that and does not let the body freely do that. And I think that applies to things like getting hit really hard, uh, heat getting hit really hard.

Speaker 1:          03:42          How, what do you mean? Getting, letting someone hit you as hard as they can with something that would cause damage and that doesn't, oh, that's crazy. No it's not. I've experienced it. Yeah, I'm sure you have. But are there a real scientific studies that show that nobody's studied it? I'd love to study it. Nobody's studied fire walking, you know, the usual scientific explanation. It's like we probably shouldn't talk about this until they do do studies because it seems so simple to do these studies and I'm not fine if for a second. I think if I hit somebody they're going to, it's kind of fucking hurt right. If you get Deontay wilder to punch you. I don't give a fuck how much Tony Robbins talks to you in common experience. Uh, drunks involved in car accidents don't get injured. Okay, but do you know why? Because they're totally relaxed.

Speaker 1:          04:24          Yes, but that has nothing to do with some altered state of consciousness is not allowing the injury to actually matter. Mind is out of the way and their body is totally relaxed. So it does the tension of falling. You hurt yourself because you're defending yourself. You're right. Right. You, your body is better off giving in to the whole, I'm saying it's the same thing with the fire, but it can't be, that's a different thing cause you're not tense. It's on this surface of your skin, which is causing the he, no, I think you're, you're tense in your nervous system, which is not letting, not able to absorb that thermal energy and Brown. We're going to do some studies on a burn. You, I'm going to burn you anytime. We'll try it. Buy It. It just, I think there's certainly, you can mitigate the sensation of pain.

Speaker 1:          05:11          I don't believe that you can do anything about the actual physiological change to a hot piece of metal interacting with the tissue of your skin. I just think they'll like the steak does not know it's being cooked. It's just getting cooked. You're going to get cooked. You are a meat. I just don't, I don't buy that. I'll show you some of these studies on hypnosis. There's doctors right now going, yes. You tell him Joe Rogan, this is nonsense. Well, I believe that hypnosis, I do believe that, but I absolutely believe you can achieve different states of mind where you feel things differently. Your, your concentration, your relaxation is in a different state. Your mind set is in a different state. I do not believe that you can change the physiological nature of your body's ability to absorb punishment like a punch kick.
