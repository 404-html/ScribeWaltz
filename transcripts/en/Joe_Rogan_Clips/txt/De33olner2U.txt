Speaker 1:          00:00          Her low freak bitches. Yeah. I've spent a year on porn sets, pain research, most research it did, it was a low, my wife did say to me once or twice, he really liked you really have to go to another pawn. So, uh, it, uh, I've just made, I've just finished making a series for audible called the butterfly effect. And the flap of the butterfly's wings, which I'm tracing throughout the series is, um, is this young man called baby in a WHO's like a tech nerd in Brussels. And he has the idea to get rich from giving the world free porn. So free streaming porn. So the series is about the kind of tech takeover of porn in the valley. Uh, I'm already real, oh no, this one's everywhere. Yeah, no, that was back, that was back in the day. That was like in the 90s. So Fabian, Fabian gave the world pornhub okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55          Uh, and friction. No, no, this is, this is all true. So, okay, let me go back. So in the 90s, this kid called Fabian good. Like Fabian Tillman as a young boy in Brussels, like a tech nerd. Uh, would like go and compuserve and swap porn passwords, porn for free like this, which is how people got porn for free back in the 90s. Um, and then it, he had like a sort of Eureka moment, which is I can, I can give the world youtube for porn. Right? So he brought up this fledgling company in Montreal Code, uh, um, it was called Mansef at the time. It was run by these two brothers up in Montreal and they had just invented pornhub. Uh, Fabian bought up porn hub and then kind of overnight singlehandedly took over the valley. Uh, there, it's an extraordinary story. This massive flow of money went from where we are now in the valley.

Speaker 1:          01:56          A community of people who were making pretty good money from porn. The money flowed into Fabian's pocket. Uh, cause what Fabian did was, um, well look, if you're, if you're a porn star and you go to a bank and say, can I have a checking account? She, a porn star or a porn star upon, well, I said a porn star, but actually aren't brilliant many porn stars anymore of your porn person. Uh, and you go to a bank and say, can I have a checking account? The bank manager will usually say no because you're in porn, which means your disreputable really yes. People, people like story. I've written about this a lot about how they find it very hard to get mortgages have the kind of hard to get checking accounts, checking accounts. That seems unlikely. I mean I would believe that may be mortgages.

Speaker 1:          02:47          They would think that your, your business is fairly unstable. That kind of makes sense as far as investments in concern and also the idea that other people, other customers might not like the idea that they're high street bank is, is being shared with somebody who's in porn. I've really, yeah, it's called reputational risk. Wow. That seems really dumb to me. Yeah. I'm going to make any sense at all. Right. Well, sure. Um, but Fabian was making money from running a site that doubt in the UN in piracy. So basically funds would upload, um, porn illegally onto pornhub. So Fabian was running the site that was filled with pirated content. Uh, Fabian went to a bank to say I want to expand, but because he wasn't extensively a porn person, he was a tech person who was deemed to be respectable. This bank gave him a $362 million loan to expand, uh, to build an empire based in part on the handling of stolen porn.

Speaker 1:          03:53          So we went to the valet who will, who will already kind of paranoid they're all that porn was being stolen and put up onto porn hub and he bought up all the, you know, loads of companies that cut price because the companies were like panicking. I wanted to sell. I'm certainly Fabian just single handedly like took her off upon. Um, so I wanna I nobody cares about that. Nobody was thinking about the consequences of that because Fabian was giving the world what they wanted, which was free porn. Um, but I was really curious to know like, well, what were, let me pause there. You said no one cares about it. No, but a lot of people did. It was a huge issue and there was a lot of like moral debate around with it. Well be, you know, there's a lot of the girls that were in porn that were really pissed off because they weren't making any money anymore and they were, there was a lot of social media posts about it, imploring people to stop using these sites, which you know, and listen to.

Speaker 1:          04:46          Exactly. People cat, you know, porn consumers didn't care. Well it was uh, it was an interesting tech, like a moral tech debate that was going on for awhile. But the debate is lost. I mean there was a, um, it's really interesting cause there was a guy who lived down the street from me and he was a big time porn producer and a, I actually knew him from my Jujitsu class and he was a real high role in sort of character. Like he always had this beautiful Mercedes Benz and he wore these really big watches, a lot of, you know, fancy clothes and he was just making just tons of money and he had this beautiful house and he was just this ball or character and then it all dried up, dried up quick. Yeah, it went, it went into, he lost his house. His house got repossessed.

Speaker 1:          05:34          Yeah. And Fabian got so rich because of this, because the money went from the offense pocket into Fabian's pocket. Fabian got so rich. Oh, how's he getting rich off of free streaming? So the ads it because, because of ads, but partly because he bought up the paid sites as well. So you know, because the paid sites were like panicking because they were losing all their money to piracy. So brought up the competition. He bought it red tube. He bought at Youporn say bought up all the competition to porn hub. Ariosa bought loads of paid sites, playboy TV. So your friend got so poor that his house got repossessed. Fabian got so rich that he installed in his house and aquarium that was so big that it diver had to come every week and dive in and clean the coral reef for no, you're doing well when you get your own diver.

Speaker 1:          06:27          That's weird. Yeah. So yeah, you're right. Porn people cared a lot, but the outside world didn't care because you know, the outside world doesn't care where music's getting pirated. So they sure as hell don't care when it's pawn. Well, they care a little bit about the music thing, but the porn thing got almost no traction. And when the porn industry essentially for the most part collapsed, or at least there was a massive amount of loss, there was no talk about like some sort of a bailout or anything silly like that. I was like, no, that industry's gone. Right. You know, act like many other industries were bailed out. And when you look at that hair smaller, right? When you look at their headquarters up in Montreal or the company that owned porn, it's not porn, it's techie. So your work, and Fabian actually said to me quite telling Lee, he said yes.

Speaker 1:          07:13          He said it was amazing. You wouldn't even know that we were in porn unless you went to the wrong floor. Now he seems like a guy who's well aware of his crime. Yeah. I mean Fabian would say, if it wasn't me, it would be somebody else. What does that mean? Um, and it sounds like a good thing to say after you kill somebody. I did say, um, it's progress. He call it progress, but it's that he's a criminal. I mean it's, it's essentially he's lucky that he's dealing in pirated stuff, right? The one tag, Fabian got annoyed with me. He was quite game like I wanted to, I wanted to interview him and then I wanted to travel to the valley to look at the consequences and trace consequence through to consequence. Like where would I end up if I just, cause I think people don't think about consequences on the Internet that much.

Speaker 1:          08:02          They want to just, you know, destroy somebody and then carry on with their day. So I want to tell the story about consequences that the only time Fabian got annoyed with me was when, um, either me or Mike Quasar director said to him, you know, you uploaded pirated porn. And he said, no, I didn't. I've never uploaded pirated porn. I offer a surface in which of the people can upload pirated porn. And if they tell us to take it down, we'll take it down. Which is have to find it, they have to find it. And also there's so much fucking free porn and porn that it's like cutting down the forest with a butter knife. It's impossible to yeah, yeah. No, you can, you can say tech down in my power to support and they'll say, okay, sorry. Fine. But then there's like a million other people's report up there anyway.

Speaker 1:          08:49          Um, yeah, so, uh, actually it's pretty, I don't, by the way, what I'm about to say shouldn't be construed as me saying that I think that Fabian has a psychopath because I don't, but that thing about not taking responsibility for your own actions, I just remembered a lot of book few years ago about psychopaths called the psychopath test and a psychopathic trait is that like if somebody kills somebody in a bar, they would say, well, it's his fault for looking at me. Funny. So failure to accept responsibility for our own actions is one of the 20 items on the psychopath. Jack, do you think he is a psychopath or do you think it's some sort of a con convenient neglecting of certain responsibility for what happened? He, I don't think Fabian, that was very much a tangential thing cause I don't think Fabian is a psychopath at all.

Speaker 1:          09:35          But, um, I think that tech people have created a sort of a moral bubble around themselves. I'd talked to the head of a porn hub's mobile division. So if you have, if you've ever watched, he's called Brandon. If you've ever watched a porn hub on your mobile, you have Brandon to thank. And I said to Brandon, Brandon said, like, we never like 99% of porn hub employees never set foot on a porn set. Uh, and he said, that's good because you know, we're designing, you know, we searched engine people were, you know, we all want to say it would be a, it would be sort of unpleasant to set foot on a porn set. It would be sort of intimidating and unpleasant. Uh, and I said, well, maybe, maybe it would have been good if more porn, her people did set foot on porn sets because you would be able to see the negative consequences of your business plan.

Speaker 1:          10:24          And Brandon went their livelihood, which again, is a very tacky thing to say, right. Because it's all about, it's all about progress, their livelihood. Yeah. What does you mean by that? Like, okay, now you want to talk about their livelihood, their livelihood people, they're essentially like a content provider that's not paying for any content. Yeah. And um, yeah, so, uh, yeah, I just remembered a guy called David Lowery who's a, who's a, um, uh, he's, he's interested in kind of piracy issue in, in music. And he said, when we look back on the dystopian movies of the 1930s, when, you know, machines will take over like metropolis or something like the moral of the film, like the climax of the film is when the people, the humans, uh, defeat say, you know, I, we're not going to live in a world run by machines. We're going to defeat the machines and human morality or takeover.

Speaker 1:          11:24          But now that machines are ruling the world, um, instead of us defeating the machines, we are adapting our morality to fit in with the machines capability. So because it is easy to pirate, instead of saying let's not pirate, we're just adapting a morality and saying, okay and we can watch pirated porn. It's fine. Yeah. But it's not as simple as pirating because pirating is what everybody does on, you know when, when they're sharing it through message boards or what have you. That's sort of pirating right when they're uploading it to these websites and servers and stuff. But what, what he's doing is massively profiting off of other people's work. It's a little bit of a more of a gray area. Yeah, I'd say so. He's not even gray kind of dark when he sent and they profited hugely from other people piloting their favorite porn films onto his side.

Speaker 1:          12:18          Has he been sued? Uh, he got into, he got arrested for tax evasion. Uh, and that's how he got out of the business eventually. But I think that will go up. That all got solved. I'm not sure if he ever got sued like, cause if somebody says to him, if somebody said to him that take down my, my, you know, bad babysitters, volume two is mine. I say that because I was actually on the set of bad babysitters volume two, he tell. Sure. Yeah, sorry, of course. And it would go down, but then maybe somebody else would put it up later that day or you know, and it didn't matter because everything else was very, uh, I tell you one amazing consequence of all of this though. Um, so what I wanted to do, and this audible series, uh, the butterfly effect was to kind of trace the consequences of this lie.

Speaker 1:          13:03          You know, what was the tornadoes that were being created. And one amazing consequence is like Fabian surrounded himself with a tech wizard slap people who knew how the Internet worked, uh, including a lot of search engine people. So instead of making porn films like they made in the 90s, this porn director, Mike Quasar, I said to me that the first film he ever made back in the 90s was called women of influence. Uh, now all the porn films have to be easily searchable. It's, it's like a kind of arms race of search engine optimization, like to get yourself up the Google rankings. Uh, so all the porn films in the valley aren't called women of influence. Cause how do you search for that? They're there. They basically see what the most popular search terms are and then make films based on that. So Mike Quasar was telling me this on the set of the film he was shooting that day, which was stepdaughter cheerleader orgy.

Speaker 1:          14:02          So I said, so I said to her, just, it was just around the corner from here. So I said to Mike, so are there, cause I thought about like women of influence versus stepdaughter cheerleader orgy. Uh, I'd look, I haven't seen women of influence. So for all I know the model of women of influences that women shouldn't have influenced, but my guess is that women of influence as a more kind of holistic poured, filmed and stepdaughter cheerleader orgy. So I said to Mike Other, any people in the valley who like, can't get work because they're just not a keyword. And My, yeah, like every at home porn actress now between the ages of 23 and 29 can't get work because they're not a teen and then not a MILF. They're like in this sort of fallow periods between teen and MILF when that just attractive and just attractive isn't a searchable term.

Speaker 1:          15:01          So if you're not a teen and you're not a male, if you're like a 26 year old adult film actress, you can't get work. You just have to lie. Well, I said to Mike, what do you do? Do you just like sit there until you lay, become a milf and become employable again and uh, the answers, they have to find other ways to make money. So escorting is going through the roof in the valley. Uh, yeah, because if the tech, because people like Fabian because of the tech takeover of pawn escort since going through the roof, but also another thing that's going through the roof is this kind of weirdly adorable world of bespoke porn. Yeah. And that's what the article will, what was the, uh, um, publication who published that article was the Guardian. I did like a written version of one of the episodes.

Speaker 1:          15:44          If there's, if the show I just stumbled upon it, you know, knowing that you were going to be here, I didn't even know you wrote it. I was reading it and as I was reading it, I was like, oh, John wrote this. Right. What an amazing, did you know about this world? No. And Rye in porn land here in the valley. So yeah, it's a pretty hidden salt. Fascinating. Explain what it is. Like people literally will request some of the most bizarre things and these people will make custom films based on their weird kinks just for them, like a team of professional porn people. Uh, because the valley's suffering so much because there's porn happened. So on, we'll make an entire porn film just for you now. How much does something like this cost? Like say if you want to make a film about girls were in Newton Ninja turtle outfits who kicked guys in the balls. That's entirely possible, right? Yeah. Oh yeah. Anything's possible. But that sounds like something that might actually sell at the, yeah. Oh yeah. Uh, they that like a couple of thousand dollars. That's it. Yeah. Couple grand. Yeah. Wow.

Speaker 2:          16:56          Okay.
