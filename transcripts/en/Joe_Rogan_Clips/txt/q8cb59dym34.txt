Speaker 1:          00:00          Do you have apprehension about the horsepower wars with just modern consumer cars? Cause I look at some of these cars that they're putting out that are amazing. Like the new corvette Zr one, right? 700 plus horsepower, right from the factory. The dodge demons, like 800 horsepower. Like they're putting out these insane race cars. Yeah. Right from the factory that any dummy like me, I could just go to a stiff, I have the cash, I go to a corvette dealership and pick one up and all of a sudden I'm on the highway. Yeah. Yeah. I don't, I don't have a problem with it now until it becomes a common occurrence where people don't know how to control, you know, hitting no know how to manage what they're doing behind the wheel of something like that. But until, until that's like a common issue. I don't know that it'll need regulation.

Speaker 1:          00:48          Yeah. Yeah. I don't necessarily think, I wouldn't be surprised though that one day maybe, you know, regulated because everything gets, you know, governance. Yeah. Maybe too much. Right. Maybe we should just appreciate the fact that you can do that. I know. I mean I want to be able to build whatever I want to build. Right. You know, if I want that, then production ought to be able to produce whatever they want. I agree. But I feel like I feel at the same way I feel about guns, like I'm very pro second amendment. I feel like, uh, I am a responsible gun owner. I didn't have a lot of friends that are responsible gun owners. I've used guns for hunting. I think you should have a gun for protection. I don't think there's anything wrong with that, but I don't think it would be a bad idea to have some sort of course that you have to go through.

Speaker 1:          01:32          So you understand all the aspects of safety and precautions you should take and how to correctly load a gun and clean and gun. Absolutely. Yeah. But this is not really the case right now, you know, and it's not necessarily, I'm not talking about gun control as much as I'm talking about gun safety and gun responsibility. I feel like the same way about car. Yeah. I feel like if you're going to go out and buy a corvette zr one, I mean the kind of body mashing acceleration, the g forces you can get from something like that right from the factory, zero to 60 in under three seconds. That's an insane automobile. Like maybe someone she's like take you around a track a little bit. That's a great idea. I guess that would be the case. If you were going to buy something like that or getting a car like that, you would need some kind of a trainer course.

Speaker 1:          02:16          Then you'd have to pass three hours on a track. If you're, if you have to have particular license to drive 18 wheelers down the interstate, you know there should be a style or a type of license that you need to achieve to have a certain type of, you know, you want to go buy a viper ACR and take it on the road. Those crazy race car vipers, you could just drive. She probably know how to drive lifer. Yeah. Those things are a little handful. There's their little tail happy. They're pretty dealer. They're so crazy too, that the race car one with all the events and all the Arrow all around it, that was just an insane thing that you could just go buy that and take that on the road. No giant as v 10 in it. It's pretty crazy. It's awesome. Yeah.
