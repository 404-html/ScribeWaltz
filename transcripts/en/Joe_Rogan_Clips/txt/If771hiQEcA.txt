Speaker 1:          00:00          Maybe you did like a boron character where you're, can you do German accent? Not Arnold Schwarzenegger. Uh, that's Austrian. Oh, okay. Yeah. Um, no, I don't think I could probably do one, but Arnold so easy. It's so like I can only do sir. I can't do Trump, man. You can't do trout. No, I can't do it at all. My voice doesn't make those. Sounds like I'm not a good impressionist. I'm just good at the ones that I can do. What does Arnold think? A Trump busy. We've had this conversation before is not a bad guy. He's just a guy. Oh, that's right. He's, he's listening. He's doing what everybody wants is making billions. These fucking porn stars and you're mad at him. This is the fucking American team who looks like for real though, who looks like him and fucks like he does. I, I'm a little bit more impressed with Donald after all the scandals.

Speaker 1:          00:51          It backfired. You guys. He's not, he's not terminal Clinton on this guy. He's not trying to fuck kids so that, hey, you know, here's the thing about it, like Roseanne Barr, they were saying that Roseanne Barr was, uh, theories that have been disproven. This is what some thing, cause she was talking about Trump, break it up, child sex rings. But he really did spend a lot of time concentrating on that and having people go out and try to break up these sex rings and sex trafficking. Like this is not something that is a conspiracy theory. This is something that he's discussed many times. It's also not a conspiracy that there's sex trafficking. So as much as you want to discount Trump, here's a problem that I have with people that are on the left right now. They do not looking at everything, throwing and looking at what they want to look at.

Speaker 1:          01:40          He's bad for the environment. He's always lying. He cheats on his wife, he does this, he does that. They say all these things that he does bad. But when something comes up, like Roseanne says, ah, I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt because he's going after sex trafficking. And then it turns out all these other people. So that's conspiracy theory. That's a bullshit online. No, he said it. He's put effort into it. Like you got to give the guy credit because if you don't give them credit for things that he does that are important, nobody's going to listen to you when you're criticizing them either because you, all you're trying to do is when you're not trying to look at the thing for what it really is. Yeah. He's this guy and he's not perfect person, but he did make note on many times about wanting to break up.

Speaker 1:          02:21          Seth just sex trafficking rings. Do you know that you're, uh, your kid is 20,000 times more likely to get kidnapped them to get shot or to school. Does that make sense? Yeah. At 20,000 it's conservative. It's probably really like 70,000 because if you go by the numbers, 800,000 to a million kids go missing every year in the United States. And I looked that up though. That doesn't, I've never found a source for that. You said that before and that it wasn't nearly as I read it online, so it could be wrong cause a problem with these things, like when we say them, especially if you say it, I'm like right now 2 million people are going to listen to us or whatever. The fucking knows. Even if it's 100,000 or a hundred kids, that's more than school shirts. That's my point. It's more than school shootings. Like what would you rather have your, you know what's worse? I don't know what's worse. Get having your kid get shot at school. Any, right. We'll get this. According to the National Center for missing exploited children, citing US Department of Justice report, nearly 800,000 children are reported missing each year. That's more than 2000 a day. The end. See Mec says 203,000 children are kidnapped each year by family members. Oh, family. Okay. Now take us a little bit at least 600,000 yeah, that'd be 600,000 so what's worse? How does grace having your kid.
