Speaker 1:          00:00          You're an interesting story man, because a, not just because your personality, but because you're, you've come back from mental illness and you very, very open about it. Yeah. Know, I think that's, it's, that's a very unique thing where I'm, I remember when you, when you beat Klitschko and won the title and then you kind of went off the rails and I thought you were just partying. You know, when I heard about it, I thought, wow, I made a shitload of money, became the heavyweight champion, all the pressure and the press and all the craziness. But it was more than that.

Speaker 2:          00:30          It was more than the, it started off like I'll suffered with mental health problems my whole life, but I didn't know what it was. Cause I never had no education on the mater. Uh, money wasn't til after the Klitschko of, hi, I'm very massive hockey. Then I ought to have a even worse hello Louis slow that anyone could ever have. Um, I'd wake up and I think, why did I wake up this morning? This is coming from my money. You want everything. Money, fame, glory titles. Our wife, our family, kids, everything. But I felt as if I had nothing. I felt there was an empty gaping hole that was just filled with gloom and doom and I just was, one bad thing happened to me after another, within seven days. The IBF stripped me of that title because I couldn't defend against gloves. Golf. He was a nobody because are very much closer if Allodynia, but the IBF wasn't expecting me to beat Vladimir, so they took that clause in there anyway.

Speaker 2:          01:23          Thinking bloody may is going to want to defend against class coffee because I won. They, they stripped me of the belt, which then none of my reason within seven days of the fight. Yeah. That's insane. How can they require you to fight within seven? No, they didn't, but they required me to, to go into negotiations and you didn't, so just not going into negotiations to sign the strip you within seven days. Yeah. But they knew I couldn't go into negotiations because already much clothes boxes a dirty, but I was stuck in between a rock and a hard place. Yeah. Um, and that's what happened. That was one belt, God. And then my team and the coach, coach team or carrying all about where the flight was going to be. It was going to be on a cruise ship in Dubai. It was going to be here. It was going to be there. Time was dragging on a cruise ship. A cruise ship. Yeah. There were some ma'am, Arab billionaire who wanted to make this fight in exclusive fight for him and his buddies. No. Uh, come on. Seriously. This fight was heading for a cruise ship. That fucking oil money, man, they've got some money and if they can afford it, do it. That's what I say.

Speaker 1:          02:25          That would have been the most hilarious scenario ever for a world heavyweight title fight a bunch of Arab billionaires on a cruise ship. Wow.

Speaker 2:          02:37          So they strip you of the IBF belt. You going in negotiation with Klitschko for the rematch. Rematch never happened. Pretty much. Didn't happen initially because I went over on my uncle in training. Um, I was in Harlem training full three much and I was running up on the heavy terrain and I went, oh, from ankle sprain, my ankle. Quite badly. So we had to postpone the folly. But by that I was off like say three months, gain his uncle right. And all up. I just, I just didn't want to do any more of your army. I didn't have the desire. The fire wasn't burning no longer to fight and I was suffering with depression the whole time. Even in training camp before I sprained my ankle, I was depressed as depressed, could be on a daily basis. And I think, why am I feeling like this?

Speaker 2:          03:19          I don't have no reason to feel like it. Some people will say, oh well each attention seeking or whatever, but unless you've experienced what I'm saying, it's sort of impossible to understand where it had been aware of come from. And it just went from bad to worse. Um, I hate the drink heavily on a daily basis. I hit the drugs. Um, I was out all night, team of women of the night and not coming home. And you know, I didn't care about boxing. I didn't care about living at just wanting to die. I was going to have a good time doing it while I was doing it. I used to drink and take drugs to get away from their depression because when I was drunk or high then I wouldn't, uh, I wouldn't think about being depressed to fall about being a boxing champion or I'm, I feel great.

Speaker 2:          04:03          But as we know when the drink was off, it only leaves you with a bad hangover feeling even more depressed. But someone who suffers with mental health, the worst thing we can do to escape it is take drugs or alcohol. But yeah, that's the most common approach. And that's the common approach because people we don't know cause it's not spoke about. And this is why I want to spread the word on mental health. So when other people are in this position in the future, they know where to go and they know what to do because there's a blueprint.

Speaker 1:          04:33          Well, Kudos to you for doing that because so few people have the courage to talk about their struggles when they go through that because it seems like a weakness. Yeah. You know, it's, it's very powerful that you are willing to do that and just be open and honest about it. There's a few people out there that are doing that now. You know, our friend moral Rinaldo, he's gone through some, some serious mental health issues and he's very open about it and talks about it quite a bit now. When you were training for the first Klitschko fight for the fight rather, did you have it then?

Speaker 2:          05:05          Not really, no, but I was set focused on what I wanted to do and that was beat Vladimir Klitschko. I believe when you've got a goal in mind or from being a child all your life and you do that, then I was like obviously lost. I was almost like I didn't have anything more to do in my life, although I could have carried on and defended the belt some, whatever. I wasn't really interested in doing that. I'd beat them on. I'd always wanted to do because when I was an amateur boxer, I used to watch flood in May, Klitschko on TV as a world heavyweight champion. And I always aimed, he was my target to beat and want to finally beat him. It was like climbing Mount Everest and didn't have anything more to prove and the fire was dead. There was no fire. I was forcing myself to fight and I always said I didn't want to be one of those people who just fought for money because there's plenty of people with money in the world, plenty of, but who knows him?

Speaker 2:          05:59          Um, the reasons for me fight, and it's not for money or, or for belts or glory, a fight because I don't know anything else. Have always been a fighter from being born to being 30 years old. Now it's all I love to do. I don't have any of a passion. I've locked. The Lord knows I've locked. And if I had anything else that was going to our, I could do, I'd be doing it. I just, I tried retirement. I was 27 or retired on the second Monday in boxing heavyweight history to retire on beaten as a world champion like rocky Malsiano before me, but it wasn't enough. I was like, I am lost without this fight game. I tried golfing, I tried clay pigeon shooting. I tried four by four in, I tried going to strip clubs, bars, restaurants, everything, and it was just like I had this emptiness inside where I just wanted to fight.

Speaker 2:          06:47          Well, in comparison to what you've accomplished, everything else has to seem pretty dull. I mean, until you step into the ring with Vladimir Klitschko, who is widely considered to be one of the greatest heavyweights ever, and you boxed his face off. I mean, that was a beautiful performance. It was shut him down. It was weird. It was weird to watch them. It's like there was moments in that fight where he just, he just looked like he didn't know what to do with you. I'm going to say it again on December. The first, like I said, to flood demand has said the same thing to Deontay wilder. You fought the Americans, you fought the Mexicans. You fought the Europeans. Paul, you ain't never fought the gypsy king before. I said, it's straight Tivola than me. I said, you look in our king. I said, who ever for king before?

Speaker 2:          07:28          He said, no. I said, we fight him on now. And he said, you're going to lose to one. Well he's lost before, but he's lost because he got clipped and hurt and stopped and I was very impressed with him actually in the Anthony Joshua fight because he came back from getting badly hurt and almost put Joshua away. But the fight with you is different because you just outboxed him. And he was known as the guy who would box and hold, Jab and hold. I mean he was one of the most boring heavyweights of all time. Fantastically successful. But from a spectator point of view, you watched some of his fights and like Jesus Christ, he would jab you, grab you, Jab and grab you. I mean that was his thing. Right hand grab you a worked here, 25 title defenses. I mean it was very successful, but that shit didn't work with you.

Speaker 2:          08:13          It didn't for the first time in his whole career, he was fighting to somebody who was not just bigger than him, but more often I take who could move more. Yeah. So money wasn't just looking for one lucky punch. I knew going into the fight in me, a flight there, everybody, all the rest of the opponents and 25 men before me, I'd a one in trying to do the same thing, trying to knock him out. And he got, he's got so many of a, a weird defense where he puts both arms out in front of him and it's almost very awkward to London. That chain where big punches so far. I'm not going to do that. Not gonna make that mistake. I'm going to outbox him on Ecmo, me teams. That test is not a good idea. We've got to go to Germany to try now.

Speaker 2:          08:52          Box a super champion and try and win on the cards. Are you crazy? I said, yes. I said, but if I wasn't crazy I won't be great. And I went over there and outboxed him. Um, nobody, nobody apart from me, brother or my father fought. I could do it. You know, even people who were close to me and camp there were like, they were very unsure of what was going to happen. I may be me. I always had a little smile on my face because I believed it. I believed I could always beat flooding. Man College go. I even told Vladimir years before, when I was 22, I said, I'll beat you one day in manual steward told him to God, rest his soul. He said, Tyson fury is the heir to the throne. He said, when his time is ready, will beat you straight to him. Probably me or hate it. He hated it. Manual talking about me like her, but he don't it either way. Well, I'm sure it was good

Speaker 1:          09:44          fire under him during training as well. Now you, you were focused for that fight. You were, you were prepared and afterwards, was it just the realization that you would accomplish this incredible goal? It's set into depression? Was it you didn't know what to do next or was it just that your focus was now no longer on this unattainable? You know, like in almost insurmountable obstacle in front of you becoming the heavyweight champion of the world. All of a sudden you did it. Then the depression kicks in.

Speaker 2:          10:17          Yeah. Molly conditioning train a Christian. He said to me before the clutch go fight. He said, what will you do after you win? I said, probably be depressed for a long time. He said, why? I said truthfully as I was almost expecting it and I didn't think I'd ever box again. Even the day after the Klitschko fight, sky's boss interviewed me, the UK broadcaster, we put it on and they said, what's next for Tyson theory? I said, I'll probably never box again. I knew. I said to me, dad and my brothers before the fight, a week before the fight, I said, win, lose or draw. I said, this is probably going to be my last fight cause I knew the fire was going. I didn't have that hunger anymore. Had the hunger to beat Vladimir Klitschko bought not to carry on and continue. And I said I didn't want it to be about money or financial gain.

Speaker 2:          11:05          I wanted to be the best of my time, beat the best man. And that's what I did. And I was a honoring me worded. I didn't box again until two and a half year later I decided to make a comeback because I was sitting here 400 pounds, drug addict and alcoholic. By the way, I'd never taco drug in my life until I got to 27 really? Never. Not smoked weed. Not, not morphing. And what drove three roads? What were the drugs of choice once you won the title? Cocaine was the usual one and that was it. Really. Cocaine and alcohol. It's like roll, it goes crazy. Drug drug and alcohol. [inaudible] but you know, I look back on it now and I think what I changed that I wouldn't, I'm not many people will, well, this man's crazy for saying that on our radio show, but I wouldn't change a thing because I know it was supposed to happen and I needed to be tested to see what type of character of us, although I did all those mud things and I went for a wall up time and I tried to commit suicide and I, how'd you try to commit suicide?

Speaker 2:          12:10          Well, I'll tell you what happened. I, like I said, I was waking up and I didn't want to be alive. I was making everybody's life a misery. Everybody was close to me and was pushing away. Nobody could talk to me, talk any sense into me at all. And I'd go very, very, very low at times, a very low. And I start thinking all these crazy thoughts. And this start near the, and I was in Macau. I bought a, bought a brand new Ferrari convertible, um, in the summer of 2016 and I was any animals on the highway on this, a strip of highway where I am, I'm at the bottom of about a five mile strip. There's a massive bridged across as the beltway and I knew that and I got the car up to 190 miles an hour hours heading towards up bridge and I didn't care what no one will sink in.

Speaker 2:          12:59          I didn't care about her to me family, me, my career, people who friends, anybody. I didn't care. I didn't care about nothing. I just wanted to die so bad. I give up on life and just as it was getting towards up your ward 90 in his Ferrari in a crushed like a coke come by way if it a bit, I heard a voice say no, don't do this. Tyson, think about your kids. Think about your family and your little boys and girls growing up with no father and everyone saying your dad was a week mum. He left his, he took the easy way out because he couldn't do anything about it. And I've, before I turned into the bridge, I, uh, pulled on the motor and I was shaking. I could feel myself shaking and I pulled over and I was all nervous and didn't know what to do.

Speaker 2:          13:43          And I was frightened and I was so afraid. And the fall, that day, I'll never ever, ever try or think about taking me on life ever again. And I didn't. I went and got help from a delete in psychiatrist, doctor in the UK and my dad were not with me. And she said to me that she said, can I have a word alone with you, John? He said, Ms. Dot. Told me what she said when he came out. She said, hey, is not to be trusted alone. He's an imminent death risk. That's the highest level of suicide risk that she'd ever assisted. And she said, without his faith, he would have been dead a long time ago. But she said faith alone ain't gonna hold him cause that's going to break. And once that goes, he's done. So without pop me duds life terror as well because he was checking up on me all the time.

Speaker 2:          14:35          He wanted to be with me 24 seven it was even sleeping in my house with me and married man before kids. I was in a right state. I'll just, I just, I, I want it. I just didn't want to live anymore and I had everything that a man could want. There wasn't nothing I didn't have, but it meant nothing. Nothing meant. And even I felt worthless on the longer it went on, the more it, it hurt inside and Amorosa it and everybody, everybody gave up on me. Before farm we fall. I was definitely gonna die and I was going to kill myself and after that I, I tried. I was thinking to myself, you know what? I need to get better and eat. I need to do something. But every time I tried to go to the gym, I don't know if I say no, they say for anymore, I'm not going to do this.

Speaker 2:          15:18          I didn't want to do, I'd drum, I'd run 200 yards and pull up. I wouldn't even get a mile. I think. Oh, can't be bothered. I don't want to do this. Boxing is not for me. I hated boxing at one stage in 2016 early 17 I wouldn't have done a box in flight for this room full of diamonds. No Way. I hated boxing. I won't watch on the TV. I won't read about it. I hated boxing. I've done it my whole life and I didn't want no part of it anymore. Um, I was out drinking. I didn't gag, give up taking drugs like I said. And it come to a point or was doing that for 18 months. I made a life and I was out 2017 Halloween. I was a 400 lbs, dressed up as a skeleton and I go to this fancy dress party in it.

Speaker 2:          16:04          I'm looking around and I'm thinking, these are all young kids compared to me. I'm 30 and I feel like I was the oldest guy in there like 29 I was like, what am I doing here? Is this what you want for your life? And I thought to myself, this is not me a number. How many people told me before this while I was going wrong, what was due? And you need to act to your life. You can only change your life if you want to change it. And I left and everyone said, are you going? Oh, early said, yeah. I left at nine o'clock I went home and I got back home. I didn't say anything to the line, but it went straight upstairs into a dark room and I took burse. Chief had skeleton, so tough. I W I was sat there and I got on my knees and I was praying and begging God to help me.

Speaker 2:          16:48          And at this point I'd never, I've never begged or cried to God to help maybe for her. I prayed a lot all my life, but I'd never been in this physical state before. I could feel tears running down my face. My chest was wet with tears because I knew I couldn't do it on my own. It wasn't possible for me because I tried and tried and tried and ended up back in Nepal. But drinking, I almost accepted that that was going to be my fate and alcoholic. So I was on my knees in his bedroom. Um, after praying for about 10 minutes, I got up and I felt the weight of the world was lifted off my shoulders. And for the first time in years I knew it was going to make a comeback. And I called my wife, I said, Paris parish, it's a ball she follow was drunk coming home from the pub.

Speaker 2:          17:39          I said, Monday morning I started to regain mission to try and get the heavyweight championship of the world book. She said, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because before this, every time I'd have a beer, I'd come back and I'm going to be the heavyweight champion of the world again. Cause it was, it was the alcohol talking. So I was like the man who called Wolf a thousand times on this, this jeep had Korea that I, that I was leaving on the past thinking about years before glory days. And after this prior I got up, I said, all right, this is going to be, she didn't believe me one second, but even when I speak to her now, she says, that night you told me that she said, I earn a difference in your voice swimming. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          18:18          next day I phoned up Ben Davison and I said, I don't want to go back downhill route when the same trainer, same promoter, say many things and everything's got to change as it. It's going to be a new Tyson fury and we called it return or the mock mission and as I went out that morning after phone in ban and arranging everything and went out for a run in me sweatsuit out, I had ambitions of running two miles. I got about five minutes into the wrong, stopped on a walked and while I was walking, I can't run on TIF up to 400 pounds before I'm going to walk, I'm going to get out and walk. While I was walking, I was flicking through on my phone on Instagram and or sees this video of Deontay wilder say in Yep. Tyson theories finally done that because the week before I'd been a boxing show in Manchester or something, and the press took a picture on mean it was like everywhere, this big fat out of shape, ugly, bald, that it bearded white as a sheet mom, I was like a state and Aidan this video, yet after seeing this evidence at Tyson fury, I finally know he's finished.

Speaker 2:          19:27          It can never come back. And if he, even if our water fought him and he's a day out and knocked him out, and before that he was talking about Mike Tyson. Now we'd not Mike Tice and I went around and I fought myself. That was very disrespectful to talk about someone who's not even from your era and one and divide them and all that sort of stuff when there's no possible chance. So, and stuff. You know what I've ever do, fight you. I'm going to give it you for that reason. And then when I saw this other video of him saying things about me and that I couldn't come back and he'd give me that much more motivation to return just so I can beat Deontay wilder. So I had all these court cases on as well. I was being charged. We've taken performance and unseen drugs.

Speaker 2:          20:07          Nandrolone swimming had never done, I had, I had nandrolone enemies system. It's fruit juice, naturally antibiotic, but they say my levels were elevated, do Uk d UK Anti doping said there was no case to answer, but all of a sudden I had a big water case on me that took nearly three years to sort of tout and by, I mean everyone said you're getting in Hotmail, Donnie is on you getting a 12 year bomb. And I said, you know what? Well you've been 12 years not just for an Angelo. I refused them as well. I was in a bad mood one day and the drug test and people come in the gym and I've told them to fuck off. This is when you were training for your comeback? This was when I was out with training. Yeah. When I was just all the time, I was fat and out of shape and not train and I was still being run them drug tested by UK Aad. Really. That's why I tested positive twice for cocaine

Speaker 2:          20:58          and everyone said no, he never getting back the but the boxing board of control spending my license in the UK for the cocaine, um, use. So I aren't a court case looking at [inaudible] band forever. Basically spantion the doctor made me medically unfit to fight. So that was after I forgot about that bit. When I was rescheduling the Klitschko to fight, uh, the psychiatrist phoned up and she says, look, he is medically unfit. He can't fight anybody, don't want to live, nevermind fight. So it was medically deemed unfit to box, suspended by the box and motor control for the cocaine use and out an underlying case on me on a refusal case. And by the way, it was racking up millions of dollars in lawyers' face too.

Speaker 2:          21:42          But I was so confident that I was going to, everything was going to be okay because when I was down on my knees, I just knew that it was going to be okay and everyone was like, what's the point in training and doing anything with you when you're not, you can't do anything. You're not in a position to do it. I said, everything's going to be all right. Don't worry. Court case comes along in December. We go. They say, right, this car case has dragged on insufficient evidence. Get rid of it. We both agreed that we was going to call it quits on the case and I go my way. They got as they pay their legal fees, I pay my legal fees. Dawn, that was a drugs case out the window. Finished the suspension. I had a meeting with the border control in the UK and they said, look, if if you can get past medically fit by doctor mentally, then we'll reassess your case.

Speaker 2:          22:29          I'm telling and denied. So I said, right, no problem. I phoned up with a psychiatrist or seeing people who would, who had spoke to all these doctors, three or four different doctor, Phil's, Dr. Jones, whoever else said, or I need to, I need reassessing, reassess me, Bang, pass with flying colors. I went back to the border control handed in my certificate by all these different doctors, examinations, physical and mental. They said, we have no other choice but to give you a license reinstated, Bang. So it was three of the biggest obstacles in my life at once. We're all done within a month or two straight away. Then not just an easy task of losing 160 pounds, whichever of got overall I'm other things. Losing weight as a fighter was something that I'd done that tron. Anyway, so that me and Ben sat about losing this hundred and 60 pounds along the way.

Speaker 2:          23:18          Back home. Spoke to Frank Warren. He became the promoter I'm frank had, right? You've had a long time at the ring. You've abuse your body. Let's get your four or five comeback fights just so you're ready. I said, okay, no problem. How one called might fight hard, the other combat fight. I said to frank, I don't need any more combat fights. Make the wild of right now. No, no, no, no, no. He said, let's have a couple more just in case. I said, I'm telling you, make the wild a fight. So this is where people don't understand. I've picked Deontay wilder. He didn't pick me. I picked him.
