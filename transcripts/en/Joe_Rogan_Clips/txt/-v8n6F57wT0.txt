Speaker 1:          00:00          Uh, it's, it's huge because until then, I was winging it. You know, it, the, the way quitting part of the sport is cloaks and daggers and you're trying to, you're, you're overhearing conversations and you're googling. So, you know, I was, it was pretty much guesswork on, on, on, on my end. You know, I got him to one 45, um, nearly 20 times on my own. But when we brought George into, and I wasn't even just about making weight, what I noticed with him was that every session was, um, productive. There was no sessions where it was, he didn't have to pop in the shots or soreness or you know, that that would just be a normal part. Whereas when we brought in George, um, that, that was a lot, each session was a lot more effective. So it wasn't just about making the way it was making the training camp, um, where he was improving the whole way through it.

Speaker 1:          00:52          He got down to one 45 a couple of times and he looked like, like a monster. You look like a Zombie. It was terrifying. Yeah. Yeah. I mean that had to play a big part in your decision to no longer have to fight it that way. Yeah. Yeah. I mean we'd already gone up to one 55 is his final flight before going to the UFC was was at one 55 and I was kind of like, oh thank God, you know, this is just to see what in the better, because when he joined he was a sort of a scrawny 16, 17 year old, but then you start becoming a man. So getting down there, it was getting scarier and scarier. And in his last fight outside UFC, I taught you look fantastic. It was a handy way coat. Um, and he just looked at, so it looked like a tank.

Speaker 1:          01:32          Now the offer came in a couple of weeks later, Sean emailed me and said, hey, we're offering you at one 45 fight in a, in April. And of course I tell Connor and he's screaming and running around. We didn't care what weight class. If he had to say, well in 25, we would have, we would have done it. John Specifically, you want as as a one 45 and that we've sort of went, we went back to back to that lighter weight class and it was almost accidental and then as soon as we got the opportunity, you went back up again. Yeah. He looked very thick at the weigh ins. He looks heavier, he looks bigger. Yeah. And it, you know that that's a part of a, you know, the lifecycle of an athlete. If you're with the same guy for over a decade, you're going to see changes. You know, he's Turkey now, he's not 18 anymore.

Speaker 1:          02:13          It's these different things going on in his life. So you have, you know, it's, that's the benefit I think of working with someone for a long period of time rather than, you know, kind of Jim helping that you, you'll know what they can and can't do. And he does a lot of unconventional training. Right. In terms of like physical conditioning, like I know he, is he still doing that, that the, all that stuff with Ido Portal? Yeah. Anytime. Ito's in, in, in Europe. Ped tends to drop in Ireland. We have a great relationship with them and he'll play around with that. A, you know, the reality is, is most of our time is going to be spent on the fundamentals of MMA and grating with ido is he's, he, especially in training camp, he will come in near the end where you're just tired of doing single leg defense is you're tired of doing pad work and he comes in, he does these fun games.

Speaker 1:          02:59          So we're still working out. We're still, he's firing his brain in different ways. He's where he's working on coordination and balance for me is the, you know, the head trainer. It's like, it's a nice break and you know, a, um, I'm sure it was John John Wayne power heard say to, you know, when you have a fight coming up, you know him anymore that you're going to ruin, you know, how many kicks you're going to trow every night. Again, you want to come in and want to do so long back and jumping in the air. Spinning Albert's itself at breaks the monotony and am amazed is fantastic. You know, cause it's all the martial arts together. It's, you're almost never going to get forward because you can always do something different, but it's still, there's still a repetitiveness to it, but it's nice to break with something unusual.

Speaker 1:          03:38          Now, how much does training change when you're dealing with a specialist, like a guide, like could be who is just, uh, uh, grappling phenom? How much do you shift the emphasis of the training to take down defense, working on grappling and do you work mostly takedown defense or do you just work overall wrestling so that takedown defense becomes a part of that as well? Um, all of that. All that. But yeah, definitely I would maybe talk about later. Like I, there's one thing I could change is that I think I was too defensive in, in my mindset for this training camp. But, uh, Habib has very specific types of take downs depending on where he is, whether it's shooting on the low single, on the, in the middle. And then on the fence. I, I, you know, long before Carnaby street, the fire them, I loved watching him.

Speaker 1:          04:25          Um, that's kind of my areas. The fence. I just love right from the Randy couture days, how to use the fence and, and a beef does it to a, you know, a new level, um, you know, when to take downs. The hidden Conor [inaudible], he hadn't actually done it until the eloquent, the fight. So it was nice that we kind of got to see that at the high crotch. I was, I, I see a bit of DC in that, the high crotch and then trip on the far leg and I think he blocked the ones, but he did catch him with it. Um, so, you know, it was a very specific take downs. Um, definitely for this training camp was the most specific that we went. And then I remember about a week out or whenever it was, he did an interview and he said, well, if he doesn't make it a fight, Tony, I don't care who it is.

Speaker 1:          05:03          And I was going down it. I hadn't even looked at Tony's fights in so long. So me and the other coaches like start like, okay, what does he do again? Oh yeah, he has that style because we work so specific for this one. Um, Tony could possibly be a fight in the future. When you, when you, when you think about the future now, after the could be fight, how, what do you, what are you thinking? Are you thinking about just rest, let the dust settle and then look at the landscape? Like what, how did, how did you approach it? I might, but he doesn't, what is he screaming and shouting for the rematch within minutes? It's hard to push for that rematch though, after that fight. Right? Sure. No, I understand the logic of that. You know, Tony's kind of errands and stuff, but I also understand this is a business and it will be a huge fight.

Speaker 1:          05:51          You know, the rematch would be a huge fight. Does it, don't you think that it would be difficult to sell because of how dominant could be, wasn't that fight? I'm sure. Uh, I do think the Roundtree showed promise. Um, I, I, like I said, I would like to have change things up a little bit, specifically a more offensive mindset. I thought defensively we did quite well. Um, but offensively we weren't really where we usually are. And, and you know, right when the fight was over, I was thinking, you know what, I was kind of going into this like not to lose, but not to win, you know, and his shots warden is Christmas. They normally are. He had opportunities to hit him, especially in the third round. And he just seemed to be the range at the time. Something was off. And then I had to do with the fact that he hadn't fought at my main two years.

Speaker 1:          06:41          Absolutely. You know, I'd say right. Yeah, of course. Of course. And we tried to mimic as close as we could in the gym. And I brought in guys that he didn't know and I would say, this is fight day. And He, you know, he would do what George, exactly what it's gonna do on fight day and we'd have a referee and so t to get the fight feel, but it's still in the gym, which rides, you know, is he at a position now where every fight has to be a gigantic super fight. And is that, is that a problem in that, you know what, I thought after the fight, after it was all over, I was like, you know what a good fight would be. It would be him versus Pettis. Like that would be a really good fight and it would be a really interesting fight in terms stylistic matchup and it would be a great fight I think for Connor to sort of just get a wild three round or I guess it would probably be a main event.

Speaker 1:          07:27          It would be five rounds, but oh well it would be a wild fight. They would probably favor him. Yeah. Yeah. I mean the boxing have, you know, when Tyson fury was kind of coming back, the government, you know, not the toughest guy in the world. It doesn't happen. It never doesn't happen to them. And me specifically to USC and there's an issue with that I think. Yeah. You know, he was, you know, I did. And as it is, early stages, we was fighting all the time. And as is natural, as you get older and as you achieve more, it is going to start becoming, you know, once or twice a year. That's just a natural progression. As an athlete, I don't care who you are, but the wild fights that he could have at 155 pounds, whether it's James Vick or just engag or pedis or there's good fights for him.

Speaker 1:          08:12          Yes. That aren't necessarily could be, they aren't necessarily Tony Ferguson, but they're a good fight to get that timing back, get everything locked in, you know, 100% but you have to factor in his personality and he's only fighting now for fights that are really interesting to him. He's not that interest in anybody. Not that I've heard Mayweather paper. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Well money, money, money, money. Right. So, you know. Yeah. What more can he, you know, even with his spending, well kind wouldn't be the eye on the future and on the eye, on the rematch, you know, like getting everything dialed in so that when he does have a rematch with Kirby, he is Samurai sword sharp. Yes sir. Yeah. As opposed to having two years off, one one boxing fight in between them and then such a grappling heavy contest. Yeah, I don't disagree.

Speaker 1:          09:04          That would be a trainer. You know, for me as a trainer that would be the ideal. But it be hard to motivate him for that. I think it would be hard to motivate them and it's, it's not the, you know, it's not really the UFC model. It's obvious it was going to be though. You know what I mean? It was going to be those two. Anybody could tell the UFC what time it is. It's Conor, Khabib time. I mean if anybody is the guy that can say, hey, this is what I want. I want a fucking tune up fight. I want a, I want a tough guy. He absolutely could. Yeah. And he absolutely wouldn't. You know who is like when, when, when he lost the Diaz as one place and a backstage, he was screaming and shouting at all the top brass. So they get getting the rematch at one 70 as quick as possible. I'm on, I'm in the background going, please don't, did you not see that fight? He's a terrifying the individual that's good at one 55, five. Yeah. Okay. Maybe you meet him again, but he was not letting that go. And then four months later he fought the exact same guy. That's where he is right now with Khabib. That's all I, that's all I'm hearing from you. Well listen, you could sell it for sure. Especially with the fucking chaos after the fight. You know, just keep Dillon dance at home.

Speaker 1:          10:17          He's grounded. Yeah. So with what would you do differently? Um, like I said from it, from a strategy point of view and my number one thing would be to be more to think more offensively that we definitely had opportunities to learn shots on when Connor land shot, you know, you know, watch the Eddie fight back again. It's, it doesn't take them a whole lot of shots. He rarely misses, you know, even if, if you look at strikes that it didn't land, those strikes were for a reason. They were to see what way he holds his hand. See what we mean? It was like, you know, you used to love watching Anderson civil back in the day and I thought they were, you know, they have a similar kind of approach, but this one, we just didn't seem to be landing in my, only, when I look back at the training camp, we did spend most of her time with a defensive mindset, and I think that's a mistake.
