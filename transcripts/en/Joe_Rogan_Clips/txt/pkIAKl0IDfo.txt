Speaker 1:          00:00          Her low freak bitches. I hated dealing with actors. I'd never been around actors and that thing that we were talking about before where people just like say things that they don't really mean because they think that you're supposed to say those things. Cause there's like a pattern of behavior that you chose to, yeah. Oh, I thought he was amazing in that film. I thought it was excellent. I thought he had a lot to offer. I mean, there was a lot of that kind of nonsense out here where I was used to real people. I mean, I mean for sure I was a flawed person. I mean for sure I was rough and I, I said I just, I wasn't, I didn't have good decorum. Like the way I communicated. I was a rough guy. You know, I'd come from fighting and then went right into standing up.

Speaker 1:          00:42          And this was only a few years later, I'm doing this now. I had my last fight in 89 so this is [inaudible] 94 I mean, this is just a few years after that I was still very sketchy, you know, so I used to belong. I felt like I didn't belong there. I felt like I couldn't be myself. Everybody was like reading the Hollywood reporter and variety on sem, like the fuck you guys reading this shit for like, it's like this. It was just, the whole thing to me was like this weird play that people were putting on where everybody was trying to pretend to be something so that they can get auditions. And I remember going on some auditions and dealing with some of those people, casting agents that had all this power over you and they exhibited it like they exerted it when you were in the room with them. They didn't communicate with you like you're a person and I'm a person.

Speaker 1:          01:29          They communicated with you like you want something from me and I don't know if I'm going to give it to you. Hmm, let me see what you do. It was just the way they did. It was just so shitty. It was just, it was gross. It was just, there was those fun, oh, it's gross. I mean, this is, this is the thing that people have. The real problem that people have with his Harvey Harvey Weinstein situation is not just that the fact that he was a, a piece of shit to all these women, it's his position of power that he had over them that he exerted. He got himself into this position and then use that position to on some, I mean, according to Whitney Whitney Cummings was talking to me about that. She's like, what you're hearing is all the women that said no to him. He, she's like, that guy.

Speaker 1:          02:11          Fuck, fuck the top out of all, fuck the column. And it was part of the deals that he gave and they even went after one of the girls. He was fucking that girl from Donnie Brasco and she did the movie with the Gretchen Mol. Yeah, she did rounders. Oh, I remember her blonde, cute thing that if you watched Donnie Brasco, she's with Donnie Brasco. She ain't got a fucking line to that movie. Not Aligned railing. She's not, she's an extra in that movie, basically Sonny black girlfriend. But when you see her in fucking whatever, she's got a bunch of lines now and it was because she was fucking high. We, they just went after a couple of weeks ago. Gretchen Maag who wasn't met, who went after just, you know, Angelina Jolie and the truth. Oh they're all saying that this is the reason why I had dick suck cause listen, they all got to suck a dick virtually.

Speaker 1:          02:58          Look, I had heard that there was a lot of them that were actually very successful that fucked him. I mean this was this, this guy's thing. It's, it's Kinda, it's, I mean it's fucked up and it's dark. But once that gets going and once that's what he does, how do you stop that train? Other than what they did and they all knew, they all knew and nobody opened the fucking mouth. So you can suck my dick. A couple of them opened their mouth. A couple of them get, they got swept under the carpet and that's always going to happen. But I'd rather fuck it. You know the rest of these, like Angelina and the rest of these people, listen, I'm over brother. I don't want to hear this shit no more. It's, it's, it's amazing. Like just the bullshit that these people creating that world.

Speaker 1:          03:39          You're right. When you go to these casting things and you see these things, you see the fucking bullshit. It boils out of a man. Well, it's one of the reasons why people in this town are so crazy. It's because their insecurity to begin with, right? The only reason why anybody becomes an actor, like why people want to be famous, not the only reason, but one of the main reasons why people want to be famous is because at some point in their life, they didn't feel valuable. At some point in their life, they felt discarded. They felt abused, they felt ignored. And they had this it in escapable need for attention. This, this whole that cannot be filled. And that was the driving force that led them into acting. Where would they could be on that stage and everyone was looking at them all eyes on them while the microphone was on.

Speaker 1:          04:29          And the words were coming out of their mouth and they were in the play or in the movie or doing standup even. It's a lot of the same stuff that propelled you and I being ignored as a child, you know, like feeling like you were nothing and then realizing that when you're on stage man then your something like that person up there with a spotlight on them, that person's shining. That's a something person that's not me. I feel like a zero. But that thing that leads you to become an actor want to become famous is also like it's, it's so fucked up with acting because you have to get chosen. It's not like music or like stand up where you can look at, stand up. All you have to do as you do open mic nights, you get funny, you build up an act in and people come to see you.

Speaker 1:          05:16          You see, you build up a career and the next thing you know you, you become a successful comedian. That's what happened to you. That's what happened to me. But with acting you have to get chosen. You don't, you don't have to work. Like if you do plays, nobody has ever going to fucking see you ever. You're never going to make it out of place. Nobody's going to see famous play actors. Nobody gives a shit about them. You have to be in movies, you have to be in television, so you have to get chosen. So you have this whole chain of like Hume, maybe I'll pick you, but I'm not sure. Are you the one? And so you have to develop this sort of personality that fits in with their, what they're looking for. You have to mold your sensibilities and your ideas. Like there's a lot of people that are in Hollywood that don't have opinions of their own. What they have is a series of opinions that they've adopted and adapted because they think it's going to lead them to be successful.

Speaker 2:          06:13          [inaudible] yeah.
