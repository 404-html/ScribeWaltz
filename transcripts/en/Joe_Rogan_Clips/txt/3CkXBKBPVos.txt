Speaker 1:          00:00          Out of Iraq and Afghanistan. It's a waste of time. It's so stupid. Why are we the, we need to rebuild our own country. And you know, those are tweets where I read that and I go, I totally agree with that. Donald Trump 100% but then the other half the time when he was on the campaign trail, he spoke about how, you know, we need to bomb isis to smithereens and we need to wipe them out. And those things are kind of contradictory. Either you bring your troops home and you, you know, didn't you think he would be able to fix everything really quickly? Wasn't that one that one of his premises? Typical Trump, you know, bloviating like, I'm going to be tremendous. I'm going to be amazing. It's gonna be the best job you've ever seen over. It's not a bad impression, but you got to change the tone because I'm not doing the full hand. You doing good movement. The movements I have is the movement. Joseph Rogan. Can I call you Joseph?

Speaker 1:          00:45          What did you think personally when you saw Kanye with that insane and ask you about that too. Bipolar ramp. Yeah. I feel kind of bad for him. I do. And I'm not, and I want to be clear, I'm really not saying that as a partisan thing because even if Bernie Sanders was president and Kanye West was in the office saying the exact same stuff, I'd still be like, Whoa, what is going on here? Yeah. Yeah. Did you burn? It helps them do it too. Because remember when he left those black lives matter chick type to remember that. I remember that cost him, but he just stepped aside. That really did cost him. You think so? Yes. Yeah. People do. You can't do, you can't just take the microphone away from someone you know. So here's an interesting question. Do you think this helped Donald Trump at all with black voters having Kanye do that, but how much a good number.

Speaker 1:          01:31          Really? You think so too? Yeah, I do. I don't know. I don't know because I feel like there's a, Kanye West has been disinvited from a lot of cookouts now as a result of what he did with Trump. Jamie's on black Twitter. Jamie says, not at all. From what I read, it did not in black Twitter. So this response has been very negative. So it was con Kanye is really almost in a sense, blowing his own reputation on this. I guess that to said, I don't think so. No. I think everyone who's a fan of Kanye west who's seen him blow up on Jimmy Kimmel and blow up on all these different people that have criticized him, he's, he's obviously got mental health issues. When he went on that rant, I think it was in San Jose, is that a concert? He said, I didn't vote, but if I did vote, he was, I would have voted on Trump.

Speaker 1:          02:17          Yup. And everybody went and then he wound up going into a mental hospital after that. Oh Wow. Checked into a mental hospital and then canceled his tour. I remember that. I do remember that. That was because he couldn't handle the criticism. It's part of it. And also part of it, he's legitimately mentally ill. I mean, look, he didn't marry that lady and be a part of that family because he's thinking straight. He's got some problems. There's something wrong with them. Yeah. You know, he's a genius in terms of music. He's, he's, he's fantastic at creating beats and songs and hooks. He knows what the fuck he's doing there, but he, he's got a problem and you hear it when he rants, when he's ranting and when he's talking about Ford making dope cars, we don't use the word dope cause we only use words like magnificent and positive words like he's, he's making, he's listening to himself and jerking off to the noises that are coming out of his own mouth.

Speaker 1:          03:11          I love, I loved when he said to the reporter when the report or pushed back on them a little bit, he's like, you just asked me a question. No, you can't do that because this is like taste and a fine wine. It's complex. Yeah, exactly. I thought that was really funny. My read on him is sensical. He's he, I think part of what he's doing is that he's a contrarian. And when you are in a place like Hollywood and you're there all the time and you're always surrounded by people who are anti Trump, I think there's something about just this knee jerk reactionary feeling of like, like, no, I'm not with you guys. I'm different and I'm special as a result of being different. So I'm a, I'm a contrarian and I'm going to disagree with you. And then I also think there's narcissism in the sense that he looks at Trump and he really sees himself in Trump and that everybody laughed at Trump when he said, I'm going to run for president.

Speaker 1:          03:56          I'm going to win. And if you remember a few years ago, Kanye West said, I'm going to run for president. And everybody was laughing at him. Wasn't even a few years ago. It was recently. Yeah. He and uh, what the fuck's on guys named Piers Morgan, right? Right into it on, on Twitter. Who said you're talking to your future president? That's what Kanye says. Oh my God. Maybe it was Harvey Levin. He said it too. You're talking to a future president actually dislike piers Morgan more than I dislike Kanye West. Kanye on that one. I think Connie's ill. Oh really? Do. And I know he's been medicated. I mean remember when he was all Chubby and he's on his medication, he got fat and apparently he got off his medication and there are a lot of people, by the way, who would hear the point you made and B would be really angry at the fact that you think that he's mentally ill even though I think that's a problem I've seen.

Speaker 1:          04:47          I've seen it all my Twitter, I've seen it on my Twitter. People saying, oh it's just a cheap partisan hacky point. Oh it's not because he's admittedly mentally ill. I mean he's been in say that and the thing he said, I was diagnosed bipolar. Institutionalized. Yeah. He spent time in a mental hospital for being mentally ill. And when you listen to him brand, this is just my opinion. That is not the ravings of someone who's carefully considering the implications of each word they're saying and thinking about how to express themselves in a way that's going to portray some sort of a clear, cohesive message. This is not, he's not what he's doing. What he's doing is jerking off. He's just jerking off with his mouth. I'm not kidding. It's just, it's just like, let me get it out. This is a fine wine. You know, we gotta, we gotta make the dope. It's caused, why can't fly by the dump was cause you know, did you hear what he said in that same thing? The reason why we got to help Larry Hoover is because in a different universe there are alternate universes. I am him.

Speaker 1:          05:48          I don't think that's correct. So song lyrics to a song. Was it saying he says that when he's off his Lexapro? Yeah. Oh No, you ain't see nothing crazier than this Nigga. When he off his Lexapro. Remember that time in Mexico? Remember the law that last time, the episode asking me, why the hell out texting code four times just to say, don't text me Ho told you four times. Don't text me how and we Finna lose all self control. But you ain't Finna raise in your voice at me. Especially when we end the Giuseppe still modern day Socrates. Larry is, man, it's lit, but I love that, that nothing crazier. Then when he's off his Lexapro, oh my God, yeah. I do kind of feel bad even though this is such a, you know, like a side show type thing because I mean the state of the country so weird that beach simply because of his celebrity and the fact that the mainstream media doesn't know how to keep their eye on the ball. You never know who can become president. It could be somebody like Kanye.
