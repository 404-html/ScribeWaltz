Speaker 1:          00:00          Although I did see this amazing video of Buzz Aldrin to do seedless

Speaker 2:          00:04          punching the guy go to, I know that guy that he punched. I want to, I want to do more moon landing tonight mean I know you know Alex Jones. I used to be a moon landing denier. I used to believe, I used to believe totally that we never went to the moon because there was a document of the came on Fox. Yes, trust me, I didn't Google the nineties in the 1990s Fox had a show called conspiracy theory. Did we go to the moon and they aired it on television prime time and they got me hook, line and sinker, and for years I believe that we didn't go to the moon. What changed you? Mostly talking to Neil degrasse Tyson, but also critical thinking. Also realizing that I was fully committed to that idea without really exploring the possibility whether that idea was incorrect and that I had taken everything that I saw in that documentary, which is incredibly convincing and with a 100% confirmation bias. I only looked at that and I didn't look at all the contrary evidence. There's some fucked up stuff about the moon landing unfortunately. And the fucked up stuff is mostly people that were involved in publicity that we're doing stupid things with photographs. Like they had taken a picture of 'em

Speaker 1:          01:13          I'm going into unchartered territory or just so you know, like you're an expert on this. I've never gone into moon landing. Denialism yeah, I don't know about it.

Speaker 2:          01:21          Uh, it was buzz Aldrin. Um, who was the guy that was Michael Collins? Michael Collins in Gemini 15 photographs. He seen it many times. Pulled up that photo. This is, and this is what I'm talking about. No, no, no. It has nothing to do with that. This is a photo that they, um, they put out as an official photograph of Michael Collins doing a spacewalk. But what it actually is, is a photo of them testing equipment and they blacked out the background. So he's in this suit that they were doing with testing and instead, because they really couldn't get good photos in space cause no one's out there with him taking his pictures. Right. So they lied, they faked it. This is it. So the, see the one on the left, you see the real photograph and this is him in a studio where they're working on him try or warehouse rather or some sort of a testing environment working on how to, uh, control these harnesses that you would use when you were on a space walk.

Speaker 2:          02:14          Cause that thing, you know, propels him forward and back and he's learning how to use it. What they did was they just blacked out the background and reversed it and then they sold that as him actually being in space. So this is probably an overzealous publicist and there's a bunch of these, there's a bunch of these when it comes to, um, different backgrounds in, in areas of the moon. There are many, many miles apart from each other. It shouldn't be the same background and more likely than not what you're dealing with is overzealous publicists because photographs were incredibly difficult to get. I'm sure.

Speaker 1:          02:45          Well, the moral of this story to me, thank God, first of all, that you're no longer a moon landing denier, but also the power of the media and the press and like you saw one documentary,

Speaker 2:          02:58          right? Was a couple after I saw that and not quite a few,

Speaker 1:          03:00          but that sent you down this rabbit hole and that.
