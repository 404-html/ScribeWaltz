Where do we get kicked off of Youtube? Craig Mack died. Yeah. That's such, that's just a shout out. I know. I feel like we should be able to, just as a kicking shout out playbook. It is a great fucking song, man. It was such a good song. Dude was only 46 what was that? I didn't even see what he died of a heart attack. Yeah. Heart failure. 46 fuck man. Major, but we start off the show a major bummer. Yeah. We're going to go, we would get pulled by youtube. Right? If we did that, we played it for sure. We, I'm sure for sure we won't play it won't play it. Let's just shout out to Craig back. You know what you could do?

Speaker 1:          01:37          Nothing phases them. Yeah. There's some guys that just keep on trucking that's like, we're not in from Chicago where I'm from. That's everybody I know. Oh yeah. Nobody skinny is offensive. Well, not only that, it gets zero degrees all day long. Yeah, so fucking four months. Yeah. You need the padding. They need something he needed to sell. You need somewhere to hide all that sadness, shove it underneath all that. Scott has gray. You hear bullets from the south side. And so when I got, when I got in a little bit of shape and I went back to Chicago, I caught this like so much shit for that from everybody. You sell out Mr Hollywood.
