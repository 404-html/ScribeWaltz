Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. Um, you know, just to flip to the other end of the spectrum in terms of what like coevolution between two different species to be like over the last 20,000 years. Look at what we've done. We've taken wolves and you've turned them into these creatures. We put Halloween costumes on and like a finding a couple of years ago, which floored me. This hormone oxytocin, which is totally trendy. Oxytocin is completely cool. Mother infant bonding is mediated by oxytocin pair bonding in monogamous species. Oxytocin makes you more trusting and expressive and generous and economic games and oxytocin has all these pro social effects within a species. Then it turns out that this hormone that has spent the last, I dunno, a hundred million years, having mothers and infants connect to each other emotionally. Um, when you and your beloved dog sit there and stare into each other's eyes, you both secrete oxytocin.

Speaker 1:          01:08          And if you pump up oxytocin levels and your dog, it will stare at you longer and you will stare longer back, be more oxytocin. This is like an ancient, ancient hormone having to do with mother infant bonding. And in 20,000 years, which is like a blink of an eye evolutionarily. Suddenly we're doing this weird oxytocin tango thing with another species, another species who we feed and take care of and they like manipulate as wildly and to like get him like good dessert, treat bones and stuff like that and they in turn do all sorts of one for stuff for our self esteem because they like lick us unconditionally. Where'd that come from? I just 20,000 years and you've like hijack this ancient neuroendocrinology about like parental behavior and now it's got to do with this weird symbiotic thing. We end wolf was worked out somewhere back on him.

Speaker 1:          02:08          What does it have any effect on friendship? Like a human being staring at each other? Did that, does anybody ever tested that? I would assume people have looked at that. It, for example, it strengthens monogamous bonds and there's a literature by now looking at oxytocin has its effects by binding to an oxytocin receptor. There's a gene for the oxytocin receptor. It comes at a number of variants and if you have one particular variant that's associated with Oxytocin, having less effective women move in your nervous system that's associated with less stable relationships. Uh, so you know, none of this stuff is deterministic. Your, your, your sex life and your romantic life has not been determined by this one gene. Like nothing remotely resembling, but that's just part of the mix. And there I was just wonder if that makes, applies to like platonic friendships, like male bonding and stuff. I wonder if there's like when guys are out having a good time, if they're also getting a good juice of oxytocin. Might guesses. When you have your, your basic like pathetic male sociality, it's just like you've like talk about sports for five minutes with some guy and as a result, you're willing to give up your life for him because like, you know, this is male, male body. I bet that's got something to do with oxytocin.

Speaker 2:          03:39          Okay.
