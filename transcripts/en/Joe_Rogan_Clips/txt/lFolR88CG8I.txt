Speaker 1:          00:00          Those are the operation paperclip. You can call it paper clip. He Shit, our government brought those. He, you think he would always say to us? Yeah, but that's the, I think there was several waves. There was like 34,000 of them. Yeah. There was a lot of fucking Nazi scientists brought over on Youtube. It says a operation paperclip was, uh, anywhere from like 1200 to 1500 psi. The total number of admitted congressional hearings in the 1970s operation paperclip, Frank Church Committee in the 70s released it and leave the numbers. 34,000, 207 look it up. There's a lot. I told you they give people simple as you pulled it up, but it is fascinating. They brought those people over here and that's where the, the space program came from. Came from the shirt. Not as a sick joke. They already had the CIA. That was LSS. Okay. The CIA's Oss.

Speaker 1:          00:51          That's all on record. Okay. I'm glad you question me. No, but I don't know what that means. What is oss again? Uh, office of special plans are off. That was before the CIA. And then the closet for teaching, so to like, um, the office of strategic services. Like what was before the seals, what Jesse Ventura was the frogs even terocin in that he was an auxiliary of the navy. He was never in combat. Anyways, let me expand on that. The LSST, the office of what is the sheet wandering refills? The Oh, ash ash was British intelligence are the most powerful British, the most powerful intelligence agency ever. They set up proud house at 22 after World War II to anglicised that U s we'd British intelligence, not a British geologist takeover a marriage. It was just all this, just like on PBS. Okay. This just stuff that's true.

Speaker 1:          01:41          They'd met say they only academics are watching it, so they'll tell the truth. The general pop culture is all crap meant to be dumbed down into turn you off. But when you go to the real academic stuff, I mean the old days of frontline and stuff, like I watched that to know if it's true. Later got the documents, it's all, it's all real. That's like, those shows were like really accurate. Like Bobby Kennedy plan to blow up the embassy and on nurture. So like what was I getting too? I don't Nazis Nazis. Well, Wernher von Braun. Really Weird. Isn't it weird that the one man who directed all six moon missions was a Nazi and he was brought in that one? Isn't that crazy? One guy, he didn't smoke weed and one guy is having a problem with memory. Two guys did. And why you want to Defend Warner? That's fine.

Speaker 1:          02:24          35 Nazis and I've seen doctors rant about it. He sketched for Hitler. This plan to drop atomic bombs that they hadn't developed yet. So when you see red skull marvel comic, they've got a big bomber to love New York. It wasn't a bomber, it was a space plane and it was about half the size, but it looks just like this. And the Germans actually some of their scientists, what's the Russians or the Russians tried to build their special, it was half the size. That was actually the German plan show show. You look it up. I'm not kidding. Because the Russians took a lot of Germans as well. Correct. About a third of them. Yeah, so look, the reason I'm wearing this just explained this is a gateway to all of it. So you have British intelligence did one world war one, Germany had way more advanced technology.

Speaker 1:          03:10          They then take over British intelligence basically merges with the u s and then the Germans and others say, we've got to go way ahead in technology. There was all theoretical and labs, but they could mass deploy it that you didn't have enough machine shops and systems to build it. And US special forces went on suicide missions and blew up the underground mountain. How about the Nazis were the first to build flying saucer, all of it. But let me tell you, that's crazy. British cars, British intelligence flying saucers, the CIA, the CIA and 47 so now the Nazis are over here and they go, listen, you don't want them running everything. And they go to Eisenhower and they say, we want to launch a off based breakaway civilization where you compartmentalize things, forget empires, and you'd have a new ruling class of technological elites. And then the elites are all in charge of the public's watching TV and we'll give him widgets and foundation series type things at the verb.

Speaker 1:          04:10          This is all in the documents and let them try to run an empire. We'll build a whole new empire. And so Eisenhower gives a speech, worry about, he doesn't just say military initial accomplished, he says the technological elite lots, the full 21 minute speech, his farewell address and 62 he says, or six 61 he says, you need to watch out about the scientist because, because he said no to the NASA plan when he found out what it was. But is it's a breakaway civilization where you don't try to run the whole planet, you siphon off resources and build a whole new advanced system, and then you play her body off against each other and collapse it. So when I say, what is an Assa if we could take NASA back over, it's bigger than the CIA. It's the real government, the space ships and the stuff that's all PR.
