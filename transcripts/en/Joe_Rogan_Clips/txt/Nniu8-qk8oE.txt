Speaker 1:          00:00          What are your thoughts on, on alien life, on life outside of this planet? Is there something you think about? Yeah, I think there must be, um, even in the solar system, I would not be surprised if we find microbes on Mars or some of the moons of Jupiter or Saturn where there's liquid water like Europa. Yeah. And the reason is, if you think about, there isn't, I think that, and it's a guess is because if you look at the history of life on earth, then so earth formed and it was just, uh, there was no life. It was a ball of rock. And almost as soon as it cooled down, we see evidence of life certainly 3.8 billion years ago, possibly even further back than that. We see evidence of life on earth. So somewhere along the line, geochemistry, active geochemistry became biochemistry on earth.

Speaker 1:          00:56          And we have some idea, you know, the, the, if you get a gradient of temperature and acid and alkaline and the conditions that are naturally present on the surface of oceans, then complex carbon chemistry spontaneously happens. So we have a, we know that life almost certainly we know that life began on earth. I mean the other option is it came from space or something like that, but probably didn't. It probably began on earth. And so that means that at least here that happened and that we know that the conditions that led to the origin of life on earth were present a 3.8 4 billion years ago. And we know that they're present on Europa today. So I don't see that there's anything special. Life is just chemistry and it, and, and the, the idea that Geo chemistry becomes biochemistry is not fanciful because it happened here.

Speaker 1:          01:51          So I think that given the same conditions, it will be surprising to me at the same thing didn't happen in that life begins. So I, that's one of the test that is one of the great frontiers of science. Now. It's one of the great challenges, which is why we're another reason we're interested in Mars because we know those conditions were there. We know there were what's called hydrothermal vent systems on the floors of oceans. Our mouths 3.8 or 4 billion years ago. So it will be good to know what I've said is right and they're, the way we find out is to find life or evidence of past life. Are you aware of uh, the speculation that was going around? What, how recent was it? That occupy thing? The uh, the octopus eggs, they, there was a group of scientists that were speculating that it's Po, you know, Panspermia the idea of Panspermia that it's possible that Octopi had come from somewhere else.

Speaker 1:          02:49          I'm frozen eggs. It actually come from somewhere else and, and landed on earth and there's just like legitimate scientist or contemplated not morons. I don't think I've seen this. The, no, I didn't, but I mean I think so. Panspermia doesn't have to be unlikely. I mean, for example, you might have seen the other day we found an earth rock on the moon. Right? Well they'll let your back on earth now cause he, Apollo astronauts brought it back then there is 4 billion years old or something. Like one of the oldest rocks ever found. Yeah. Right. So, so we know that material gets transferred between planets. Um, and so it's not inconceivable that microbes could survive that journey. Right. We know that microbes can survive in space, for example. So that isn't mad. Uh, is probably unlikely, but he's not mad. But with the octopus, I hadn't heard that. But the thing is that the octopus is still extremely similar biologically to us. I mean the differences are negligible. So he still got the same energy system with a single ATP and DNA and all that stuff. It's all very, very similar. It was something about RNA and DNA. Did you to find that out

Speaker 2:          03:50          girl? I'm trying. If I'm looking at different one from a different website, it's about the same thing it has to do with the Cambrian explosion. And there, there are 33 authors on a paper that got published in the progress and of in biophysics and molecular biology that talked about this possibility. There are other people that disagree with it though,

Speaker 1:          04:07          right? I mean, yeah, I suppose the, I haven't seen it. So I think it's unlikely because the octopus is extremely similar to us. So that suggests a common origin to me that's oppose the cancer argument. You could, you could advance would be, there's only one way to do life. So you could say that actually given, because the laws of physics and chemistry the same everywhere. So maybe it's maybe DNA is the only way to do it. So that's the way it gets done, which is why they're so similar to us. All those so alien as well. Yeah, they, they're not though. You know, that's the thing about it. Not so that's why I'm surprised a value because they're not the alien that they're very similar while they're in their abilities. I mean their ability to transform their outer outer texture and their color almost instantaneously.

Speaker 1:          04:54          Oh yeah. I mean they have incredible camouflage abilities that really don't exist. And the Ma'am Mammalian world. Yeah. But on a cellular level, you look at an ox for sal and among under a microscope, and you wouldn't be able to tell the dean she knocks per cell and humans. So the only way that that would make sense as if all life comes from basically the same kind of building blocks. And just varies depending upon the conditions and where it takes place. I'm I'm guessing, but yes, that that must be the, there the only way you could sustain that given that they're so similar to us because they really are biochemically is that that's the only way it can be done given the given the building block, the toolkit, the laws of nature and the, the elements and so on that we have in our universe, we have so many different life forms on our planet, but if we found anything that's remotely similar to what we have here on earth, on another planet, it would be such an incredible discovery.

Speaker 1:          05:45          Like when we sat, if we found a frog on the moon, I mean there was, the world would stop. Right. I'd be very surprised they were in the car going to me. What I mean if we're found anything, anywhere that is any in any way similar an insect on Mars? Well this is, I mean as I say, it'd be micro. I think we single celled things. Remember, I mean, you mentioned the Cambrian explosion. So that is that what we do that earth is, although life began, let's say 3.8 billion years ago, it wasn't until around 600 million years ago or so, or maybe most 700 that you see any complex multicellular organisms. That's all. So for something like 3 billion years, it was single celled alone, and that's one of the reasons why I would guess, if I had to guess, I would say that microbes would be common because life began very quickly on earth. And I wouldn't be surprised to find it on Mars, but complex life, multicellular life, insects, plan intelligence, I would guess would be very rare because it took so long on earth to get there and you just slime for 3 billion years of slime.

Speaker 1:          06:55          That was it.
