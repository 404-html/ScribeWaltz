Speaker 1:          00:00          What you're saying is one very important point that we need to move past the military gatekeepers of technology,

Speaker 2:          00:05          right? Though it's, it's big tech, which are at advertising agencies,

Speaker 1:          00:14          things that are constantly predicting your next purchase,

Speaker 2:          00:17          right? Yeah. Cause if you, if you think about it, and I'm in even in a semi democracy look like we have in the u s I mean those who control the brainwashing of the public in essence control who, who votes for what and who controls the brainwashing of the public is advertising agencies and who increasingly are the biggest advertising agencies or are the big tech companies who are accumulating everybody's data and using it to, to program their minds to buy things. So this is what's programmed the global brain of, of, of the human race. And of course there are close links between big tech and and the military. Look, look at how Amazon has, what, 25,000 person headquarters in Crystal City, Virginia, right next to the Pentagon. And then I'm in China. It's even more direct and unapologetic, right? So it's a new like military industrial advertising complex, which is his guiding the evolution of the global brain on, on the planet, which

Speaker 1:          01:20          not with this past election, right. With all the intrusion by foreign entities trying to influence the election that they've, these giant houses set up to write bad stories about whoever they don't want to be in office.

Speaker 2:          01:36          Yeah. In a way, that's almost a red herring, but I mean, the Russian stuff is almost a red herring, but it revealed what the processes are, which, which are used to program. Oh. Because I think the, whatever programming of the American's minds has done by the Russians is many key minuscule compared to the programming of Americans' minds, by, by, by the American American corporate and government elite. Right.

Speaker 1:          02:04          Say That anybody's even jumping in as well and elite.

Speaker 2:          02:08          Sure. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's interesting if you look at what's happening in China that's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They're, they're way better than the, than we are as much more horrific. Right. It's more, it's more professional. It's more polished. It's more centralized. On the other hand, for almost everyone in China, China's a very good place to live. And you know, the level of improvement in that country in the last 30 years has just been astounding, right? I mean, you can't, you can't argue with how much better it's gotten there since Deng Xiaoping took over. It's, it's tremendous because they're not, they embraced capitalism to a certain extent. They've created their own unique system. What labels you give it is, it is almost arbitrary. They, they've created their own unique system as a, you know, crazy hippie, libertarian, a narco socialist, freedom, loving maniac.

Speaker 2:          03:08          That system rubs against Migraine in many ways. On the other hand, empirically, if you look at it, it's improved the wellbeing of a, of a tremendous number of, of people. So hopefully it evolves. And the way it's evolving now is not in a more positive freedom. Love. Well, it's not in the more freedom, loving and an archaic direction. One would say it's positive in some ways. Negative and others like most complex things. Why do you live there? Um, I fell in love with a Chinese woman. She's amazing. She has great reason. We had a baby recently. She, she's not from Hong Kong. She's from mainland China. I met her when she was doing her phd in computational linguistics.
