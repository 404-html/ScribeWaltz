Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. Well this is one of the reason why I want to bring this up is because everybody always wants to talk about the power of belief, you know, and how important the power of belief is. And it's super important, you know, and said it's a big factor in Connor success is this like insane belief he has in himself. But even with the power of belief at 10 you still have to deal with the limitations to the body. Correct. And you still have to deal with like what is the reality of getting hit on the chin. Correct. But the, that self belief that Connor has got him into the biggest fight and come at sports history on if he even had a little bit of doubt, we're not here, you're 100% we're talking about them. I know. So it's a fine line. Say Ah, self belief only goes so far, man.

Speaker 1:          00:45          Even myself, I myself belief was so high private match my skills, but I was so confident it can beat anyone in the world. I'd beat a lot of guys that probably had no business beating or just getting through the beat cro cop. He's a legend. And you beat him by Naca. Yeah, but like get getting through golden gloves. Man. I thought I was the next Mike Tyson. I brought, probably not, but I beat most of those guys. Just stuff. Sure. Whale. But I believed in my heart of hearts I was going to be the best of all time. No, you were a competitor. And there's some people that have a hard time with the, the big moment. Conor obviously shines in the big moment, but at the end of the day, even with that insane belief, you get to see his physical limitations. But what you got to see though is, well, you got to see a lot in that fight, but you don't know what's going to happen until they do it.

Speaker 1:          01:33          That's why I didn't fight. So he has this amazing, uh, belief in himself and he had a really interesting style man, that whole thing where he was doing like putting his hands out there and, and pap pap pap and them. Yeah. And then throwing off offspeed punches and then drop it. And then how about is that his ankles were so good, so good and and so exaggerated and big. He'd get fluids back and Floyd, just scary, smart. He went, turned into him. They give him more of an angle. He would just cover up because you need, the ref was going to stop it. The real MVP of that fight. Granted, you know Conor and Floyd, that ref, I read them fine, you're the real MVP. And it did. He came, you know, his opening dialogue with the hell was that he was just staring at Mcgregor.

Speaker 1:          02:14          Like now we don't want to know that that gay Raslan and just like students, I don't think he said that. I think I thought he was way over the top. I wanted to fight to start, so I thought he was over the top because I wanted to fight. C'Mon, let's go with this fucking national anthem. You do that in a locked room. But I just thought it was off to the wrong foot. But I think he, granted, I don't think Connor was gonna win that fight as it went on. However, he, the Connor did have an advantage. If they went in tight, he'd even let it get there yet. Grappling under hooks. What? And that was where Conor was going to get his rest. He didn't have that opportunity. As soon as they got to that ref separated. Yeah, it was good. He was gonna let them fight it.

Speaker 1:          02:55          Yeah, he was gonna let him fight though. Here's the perfect rest. However, I think Connor thought you'd be able to get his rest in those moments and just never was capable of doing it. Cause the ref, what's that thing? He got more tired than he ever thought it was going to tell. So the efficiency of Floyd, here's what I did. I watched it live from the uh, third round on. I got offstage, Washington DC, the first two. I ran upstate. I did last yesterday. Oh God. I watched it yesterday when I get home, but I've, I flew home, um, I'm airflow upstairs. It was the, they had it on paper view in the upstairs green room. So we ran upstairs and type move. Yeah, it was, but I caught on the third round. I'm yelling, Ian Edwards. I'm like, I'm like, how's it going? He goes, the fights. Great. This is a great fight. So I got in there like writing it. I didn't want to give, this is people waiting in line a long time. The show started late. People bought tickets months in advance, and I'm like, I'm not cut my shelf short. I'm going to do the full show and then want to thank everybody good night and then wants to fight. You're a better person.

Speaker 2:          03:57          Okay.
