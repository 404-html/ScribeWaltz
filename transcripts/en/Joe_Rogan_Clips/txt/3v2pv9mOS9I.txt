Speaker 1:          00:00          When did you realize that beaver would delicious? Not till after I, I think I know the first one when I was in the first one I ever ate while I was in community college, I still tell people about the beaver that you cook for us in Wisconsin and how good it is. And they look at you sideways. And Mike, I'm telling you, man, it was like the most delicious pot roast I've ever had was fantastic. Yeah, it was really good. There's even stories about early on with the, um, when early explorers, we're in this country, they had a difficult time getting phished sometimes and beaver were approved for the Lenten meal because they were aquatic. Wow. So on Fridays when you had to have, like, when you're supposed to have your meat free day, you were allowed to eat beaver meat because they were a water animal.

Speaker 1:          00:45          It was a very popular food item. You follow what I'm saying? Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I get it. The first one, the first ones we ate, I had started reading about, I'd always read narratives, stories about the mountain men. Um, meaning like when I say mountain in like a very specific thing like a, you know, a rocky mountain beaver trapper who was sandwiched between who is sandwiched in time between the end of the Lewis and Clark expedition and the collapse of the beaver market in the 1840 [inaudible]. It's like a very like finite period of time was what a mountain man was explained to people how big the beaver market is. Cause this is going to blow people's minds. Well, America's first, you know, asked her, John Jacob Astor, like the beaver market made America's first millionaires. His fortunes came from being a beef or trader, the richest men in the country.

Speaker 1:          01:38          Their money came from beavers. Yeah. And he was in on the business end of it. He wasn't in on the trap and then have it right. He was in on the habits the for companies. Yeah. The big for our company when we bought, think about like this, how big it was for us to do the Louisiana purchase and to buy that chunk of land. Uh, when Lewis and Clark came out, part of their mandate was to suss out to potential for the trade and beaver hides. Wow. It'd be like buying something I'd wanna know about oil and gas. Right. You don't know. It can be justified this through oil and gas, they're looking to justify it through trade and beaver hides. Now also, there was also language about that they might find out about whether wooly mammoth through existing out there as well. So there was like some confusion about what was going on.

Speaker 1:          02:25          Wow. They really thought that woolly mammoths were still alive. Jefferson was interested in that stuff because he had, he had been to some areas, uh, he had some familiarity and Ben to some areas with these large bones and he was puzzled. Bottom. He was wondering if this wasn't some, if it may be in fact, was not a, an extinct species, but was somehow living in the American west still. How hard is it to real historians like people, not historian, popular historians really love to make a big deal out of that. Cause it's so weird, but it wasn't like, Hey, let's buy the, let's do the Louisiana purchase transaction because of the possibility of locating ma'am. It's, I think it was like an idea that was floated around. People see it in a, they, people such as me see it and perhaps overemphasize what it meant, but it was an idea that was out there.

Speaker 1:          03:09          The beaver trade stuff was certainly a big factor. Another thing I was reading about recently that to point out to your, to your, uh, that you might think is interesting is that people have this idea of Lewis and Clark going into this unspoiled uncontacted landscape. I was recently reading a piece by a historian who is talking about at the time of Lewis and Clark headed out into the great plains. There were native Americans living on the great plains who had been to Europe and met the King of France and returned back to the great plains well year. They, they went out in the early 18 hundreds so they were out in 1804 wow. You got to, if you imagine the time from the time in the 15 hundreds when the Spanish, right, we're poking around and come like corn auto, right. Coming up from Mexico into the Great Plains Cabeza de Vaca being shipwrecked, wrong, the Gulf coast and people pushing up into these areas that was hundreds of years prior.

Speaker 1:          04:20          Like the distance that separates, imagine the distance has separated Lewis and Clark from the first Europeans who were doing activities in and around the great plains is like the distance and time that separates us from Lewis and Clark more so. Right? Yeah. It's the distance and time that separates us from the declaration of independence. It was like a long history of people messing around crazy. However. Yeah, but think about too, like Lewis and Clark were encountering people who had horses, right? Right. And those horses had been, was horsemen traded up. So that's just like a side note. This idea of eating beaver. So I got from reading about the mountain men, I got interested in decide cause he's always see like anytime you read about mountain and you're always going to find the part where the author talks about how much mountain men liked beaver tail.

Speaker 1:          05:08          Um, and the first people that tried it and be retail, it was around when I was, I was in community college at the time and my brothers, I remember stuck a B retail in the oven for awhile and cooked it. And they report it back to me that like whatever it is they're talking about. Uh, isn't that like there must be some other explanation. We beavertail yeah, yeah, we ate it. And Wisconsin, we have a, there's a, there's a hotter, there's like pictures and an explanation of how to prepare, how to actually prepare a beaver tail mountain man style in the meat and your fish and game cookbook. It wasn't bad. It was just blend. It's just fat. It's fat. So after that we started thinking that when they say the mountain and like beaver tail, we thought it have meant they like rump based the high end quarter.

Speaker 1:          05:58          So we started when we went. I would catch beavers. Um, I'd be careful when skin and I'm just not get the caster. The beavers have two large glands on the inside of their legs. They're like, talk to him there. What it looks like if you lay a beaver on its back, talked to kind of on either side of its, uh, of its like if it's a male like talk to you, your side, it's penis or either side Clayco you'll, you'll see a, uh, not call a couple like vent. You'll see these, these glands that are the size of, I don't know if you make like a, if you take your index finger and your thumb and make a circle, there's like a gland on each side called the cast or gland. There's oil gland in there. They used to use it for perfume. It still has value today.

Speaker 1:          06:35          It's used for a wide variety of things. The smells beautiful. If you ever walking on a stream bank and you smell like a strange perfume smell, it's usually be recast her. Wow. Smells great, tastes like shit. Tastes like you're eating. Like you rubbed roses or something all over your food. So start figuring out like to, to skin them and be very careful not to get the cast or on your knife, forget the cast or on your hands. And then we would just take the meat and put it in crock pots with potatoes and onions and stuff and just cook them down in a crock pot. You could pick them and it was like roast beef. So when I started eating that, but I still then later I realized that it read all their accounts of how people are prepared be retail. And if you take the tail like the Scaly ass tail, and it really should be from a fall beaver cause the tail will be twice as thick in the fall than it is in the spring. They're of Macy aided in the spring. Um, take the tail and skewered on a stick and put it next to a fire where the skin starts to bubble and boil away. And pretty soon you can just peel that skin away and was hiding under there. Is the, the the best equivalent, like the best equivalent or point of comparison I can think of. We'll beat it. Just, it's like if you had a really, like imagining you're getting a grass fed steak, right, but still has that fatty gristle on it. It's just made up of that gristle

Speaker 1:          07:56          like what a lot of people would trim away from a steak and eat. That's what's inside that beaver tail. But people eat these individuals that were doing this for fat starved eating such lean meat all the time. I think they loved it because here's like a chunk of fat. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          08:13          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:13          And they had ready access to it cause they're catching them to make a living. And if you're just eating the meat, there's no fat on the meat. And so they would compliment it with just eating the beavertail fat. And I'll often tell people about, and I even gave some to the, there's like a, uh, culinary arts institute and I gave some chefs that stuff and everyone, the eats it points out, there's not that it tastes so fantastic, but it's just like really interesting to try and eat it, the fat from the tail. And it's like you got to put yourself in position. You've probably been in this too, where if you're, especially if you're out hunting and eating, you know, like freeze dried food or not eating great and you're just exerting yourself all day all the time, how you're doing what you want to eat changes a lot. Yeah. And you, the level of appetite you have is off the charts. Yeah. And so just like to eat like a big slab of fat, it'd be very excited. Was appealing to people. Yeah.
