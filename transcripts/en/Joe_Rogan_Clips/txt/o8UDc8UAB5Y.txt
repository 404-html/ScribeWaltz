Speaker 1:          00:00          Ooh, spin Colby. You got Ben at Ben Asker in there now. Now during tail has a shot to be a champion. I'll tell you what, even though Robbie Lawler lost that fight, God damn, he looked good. He looked good physically while I grab the way and he looked Jack Best I've ever seen him. He looked amazing. Apparently he had a tremendous strength and conditioning routines. Yeah, he looked real good and he was fighting fucking for Roche. It's like the Robbie Lawler of old. He didn't look at all diminished and I think maybe the time off was good for him because he had to get a ACL surgery. So it might have been dealing with something before his last fight. We don't know. Do you think maybe it was to where Ben Adkins very so one dimensional. He didn't have to worry about the striking at all. Um, there's a little bit of that for sure.

Speaker 1:          00:46          But the fucking fight started because he launched Ben Astroneer to the ants. Slammed him on his fucking head, which was crazy. Then as tough as shit. Yes, Ben, one controversially. We don't know that there was still what two minutes left in that fight dude, I've been watching their dog choke. Yeah. With that much time. It could've got pretty dice for four fucking um, uh, uh, can we get a dicey, we can't just chalk go Benz. Uh, Ben, I think you put it on his Twitter or an Instagram page. We see Robbie Lawler's arm go limp to Dick goes limp. Now here's the question. Did it go limp because he just let it go cause he was trying to like let you know, just let it go cause he's trying to like that's a weird, hang on cause the choke, he was like he's squeezing really hard. It's going to tire his arms out.

Speaker 1:          01:33          Robbie said it was an under his chin now but here's the thing and this is people need to stop saying that you have to be under the Chin could choke a guy unconscious. You can do both. You can choke a guy on conscious across his face before she can go across the face. Right like this. And if you have a real squeeze, you have like a Marcello Garcia squeeze. You could put a guy asleep. Think I'll strong. Ben is to, Ben has a real squeeze, phenomenal squeeze. He's trans and he's in this position. Would that bulldog, you can get a lot of leverage in that position. I mean, I don't know how he's gripping. It's so much more torque Torque, so I don't know if he went out and then Ben let them go a little bit and then he popped right back awake. That's what he's saying.

Speaker 1:          02:13          You're your natural movement though. If you go, if you're fighting a choke, your your natural is to hold onto it is not to go lip. That's true. That's true. That that's why I'm like, all right. Maybe he was out. We thought he was out. Yeah, he thought he was out, but in all fairness, I thought Ben was out earlier. Me Too. We're not. They're going to stop. I thought there were a stop and Robbie slammed. I'm like, he's out. He's out. He was fucking, I thought he was out, but damn, he can take a fucking shot. He can take a fucking shot because Robbie hitting wants some hammers. I was nervous for that fight. Ooh, it's crazy. We've hooked him up so much, so much love, so much, and when he came to Daddy's do Goober, dad bod, I was like, damn, his justice terrible, but let's figure this out.

Speaker 1:          02:55          Let's see. Do you have a video of it? Check both of his pages. I don't see he posted it today. I think it was a Twitter. Yeah, I think it was Twitter and I think maybe he might've either repost it or replied to it or repost it with a comment. Oh, he says this is what happened to it. It's in the conscious to comment. Okay, well let's say it when he said this is what happened. Then go to whatever he was commenting on and then you'll see the video whenever he was commenting on is the video the only, basically they were saying that in the video that he see. Let's check it out here. Jack Sparrow. There it goes. See carefully. You will see that Ben Loosen his chalk chalk choke a little bit, and then herb dean touch. Click on that. Click on that goes to a long thread.

Speaker 1:          03:38          Yeah, but if you go to the top of that thread, you'll see the video. There it is right there at the top right there. Watch this. So check this out. See that right there. Normal move by Bob. But look, but Robbie does give them the thumbs up. That's the other thing that you're not seeing that it's not a normal movement, but it is a tight squeeze. It does look like his arm went limp. I think it went out for a second and came to, well, herb said, what herb is saying is he told Bam to stop when the arm went limp, when the arm went. Lynn Ben said is that he's lightening up and then he lightened up and then Robbie came back to life. That's fair. That is entirely possible, folks. It's entirely possible. I do not know, but I do know that Robby Lawler is a classy motherfucker because he complained a little, said what the fuck does.

Speaker 1:          04:25          All right man, good job. Good fight. He's been in the game so long and he's like, he can see him. He goes out, he's got to, he's got a great attitude. He really does. He's got a great attitude and a, I don't think it stock dropped in that fight. I really don't know. No, I really don't. And I would like to see the rematch. I don't, well, I want to see it again. I mean he says no, but Ben says no big. Ben Says he didn't want to fight him in the first place. Why would you turn right fucking murderer? But he was so amped up for that fight too. So angry and like you could see in his face he knew what this meant. Dude. How about Ben versus Uzman mother fucking fight shit. Oh Damn tail. Yeah. Ben, your performance. Your Shit. You barely one. Your ugliest. Fuck. Your Chin is too big not to miss. You have no respect for no one. Oh did I say your a curly headed fuck. See in London, muppet well till has a tough fight in London though too. Yeah. Mazda dials. No joke, man. Maza dolls. A very technical guy. He's got a wrestling to men, he's getting everything. Yep. Very good at everything and very good wrestling. And I think that's probably where he's going to try to put Darren till after that Woodley fight. He said.
