Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. Of course. I feel like there's more people that are leaning right today than ever before and I attribute it entirely to the people on the left piano to thing. That's funny about it is that most human beings, even if you'd just look at the United States, right, most people are not the extreme right or extreme left. No overwhelming majority are not right. I think a lot of the staff is also a little bit media created in the sense that he's like, let's find the moss bat shit crazy person on that side wants put the spotlight on them, which make everybody go like, what the fuck? Who are those crazy people? And that's how, it's kind of like if you were to peek, you know the Westboro Baptist Baptist Church and make it be representative of Christianity. It's not, you're nobody. If you keeps putting the spotlight there, you'll create this perception with create a backlash and it becomes this thing where like that's one of the funny thing that I was noticing because I really don't like political correctness.

Speaker 1:          01:00          I really don't like academia. I really don't. You know, there are 10,000 of these things where I'm like, yeah, that's, I'm completely on board with not liking some of these things. But then there's another side where, you know, I have been teaching a university since 2001 I don't think I've seen once a case of the kind of political correctness that I see in articles in media. No. Once, you know, like I was doing the math, I had probably maybe 11,000 students in my classes over the course of these years and I don't, I haven't heard one person ever defend the hardcore communism or make an argument. Even among my colleagues, which I have issues for other reason. That's never been one of the things. So I'm like, I keep hearing about it, I read it on papers, but why is it that when I spend, you know, that's how I make my living.

Speaker 1:          01:49          I'm on college campuses all the time. I hardly ever see it. And so I'm thinking, I'm not saying that it's not true. Of course. I mean, of course the stories are true. There's no argument. But what I'm wondering is how much do they get blown out of proportion because you get clicks because it makes for an interesting narrative, which then some people also leave off kind of narrative. And I'm like, how much is it something where you're putting the spotlight on a rare exception and make it the norm versus how much? It's a real thing because you know, you would expect, I mean I teaching south and California and some of the most elite, you know, Santa Monica as one of the most liberal places around. If the seeing was as dominant as advertised, I should be running into it all the time. Right. And I don't like that stuff.

Speaker 1:          02:34          So I would be sensitive, you know, I would be paying attention and yet I don't see it. So I'm like, hmm, what's going on here? That's interesting. Well, I think the instances are more frequent than ever before. But I also think if you put it into perspective and think about how many universities there are across the country, I mean there are hundreds and hundreds of universities and if you have one incident that breaks one month in one place exactly. And it was about one conservative speaker that's going to give a lecture and everybody freaks out and goes crazy. And all the people with green hair fucking bang on the windows. It's a, it becomes something that people were worried about spreading. And so I think that's one of the, one of the reasons, cause like, I'm sure you're familiar with the story from Evergreen University, Evergreen state. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:25          That was a fascinating story. And for people who are interested in it, Google, uh, Bret Weinstein and um, evergreen state college. And you could listen to him on my podcast. I had him on right after it all went down. What had happened was there's a thing called the day of absence that had traditionally been people of color would stay home just so that people would recognize that like, oh, when they're not there, we missed them and we missed their contributions. And they're an important part of our community. I think that's a little silly to stay home to do that. But I think it's not a bad thing for people to recognize that everybody plays a part. And if these people feel marginalized, give him a little extra juice, that's fine. But the real hardcore social justice warriors decided that's not enough. Instead what we want is all white people to stay home.

Speaker 1:          04:13          And like you can't do that. And of course, cause the, now you're telling people to stay home versus allowing people to stay home in which a case you missed them. This is the opposite. You're telling these white people to fuck off. So Brett, who is like a fiercely progressive person, was telling people like, you are making a mistake here. You're getting out of line. This is not the way to do it. And then they went crazy and they're fucking looking for him with baseball bats. And they, you know, they, they, they literally kidnap classes. They held a teacher, they held the principal or the president of the school in this room. And even when he, they went to the bathroom, they escorted him to the restroom and then brought him back to the room and they wouldn't let people leave. The stories are amazing. No, I mean if had that stuff, he's complete batshit crazy line.

Speaker 1:          04:59          Right. That shit crazy. Completely agree on that. It's like that is ridiculous. That has no place anywhere. That's bullshit that you don't do. Stuff like that is just same thing as like, you know the Jordan Peterson thing in Toronto, that policy, we'll just do a pick policy and he was right in are going against you, so I'm not arguing that those are the dio role. No, I know you're not. No, you're not the right. My issue is from there at wire we're going to dcs and the super prevalent thing, it's like from one story or one study there to say instead, you know there's a communist conspiracy to brainwash as well. It's like, okay, what we are starting from a completely understandable parameters and taking it like 25 steps too far. Yeah, I agree. I agree. But I think that what's happening is more of these unusual situations are occurring and so people were terrified of this spreading like wildfire across the country because kids are very easily influenced, you know, and there are also idealistic, you know, they, they wanna change the world.

Speaker 1:          05:58          Maybe they grew up with a father was an asshole and a racist and like fuck this, no racism, no fascism. And they're calling everybody a Nazi and running down the street. [inaudible] has a question, not as a something I'm sure off, but what I want that is our match of daisies, media media fueled them and would match is real. I mean [inaudible] he yelled for sure. My question is how much is some, well, there's most certainly media influences people in it influences people in a bunch of different ways. It shows that you can get attention for doing certain things. It shows that other people were in support of maybe what you thought, what your radical idea and that you find other radical people as well. But I mean that's also the argument for not publishing the name of school shooters. Right? It's because a lot of these people think that this is media fueled by people that are seeking attention.

Speaker 1:          06:48          I think they're probably right and certainly in a certain respect, but it's also just a part of who we are and I think it makes us really consider and taking the responsibility. What is significant about broadcasting ideas and how much influence these ideas have on people who absorb them. For sure. Take them in for sure. I think my issue, it's some of the things that often it becomes a partisan thing. It become my gun. When your guys do that, then they showed us totalitarian sinks, then boom, bat totalitarians where my guys to wait, I'll turn the other way and pretend it's not true to me in fact is not a one particular ideology or another. It kind of goes back to what you were saying about human nature in general, totalitarianism. You know, this idea that you want to control what people think they are.

Speaker 1:          07:39          Choices is horrible, but regardless of who was doing it and in that case, nobody has a monopoly on this because you have seen a hardcore religious fundamentalists push totalitarianism. You have seen her, you know [inaudible] ideology like communism pushing totalitarian. Yeah, completely right. You'll see people on the political left, volleyball on the political right. Everybody has the, it's a vitals, you know it's a fire of self. The mind that when it takeover, there's this desire to squash rollout are choices and I find it equally horrible that regardless of who doing it, you know I'm a little suspicious when the night Ruthie becomes Luca dose guys doing it and you're only picking one side. Like there are some guys where I see even the desk better too. They try to be like, no, I'm fair. Look, I pick up my, I was listening to somebody doing this thing.

Speaker 1:          08:27          I think it was more rightwing Gloria and [inaudible]. He was saying, Oh this time we are wrong. And I was like, oh look at that. That's kind of a set of cottages. That's interesting. Let me listen. We are wrong because we are just like the left and you should hear what the left at the and then for the next half hour he goes on about the left and be like [inaudible]. He sees a motherfucker [inaudible] parties on shale. That's like not being honest to me is and that I think what bugs me is when it's an ideological battle, when you want to score points as opposed to saying, look, there are certain scenes that are fucked up that are evil totalitarianism regardless of we charge a TV's attached. Wheaties bad. Yeah. How about we agree on that. You know that's, that's kind of where some, sometime I feel Alito sketching the way the narrative gets pushed that it becomes a, my tribal versus your thrive is saying, well you would probably know better than most because you've been teaching in universities for so long.

Speaker 1:          09:21          I mean you would see that you're on the battlefield. I think a lot of what it is is a lot of what you were talking about before about people doing horrific things is that they're cowards and they just give in to the whims of those around them and the mob mentality. And I think that happens with the right wing ideology that you see expressed in horrific ways. Like, you know, whether it's uh, you know, I mean, fill in the blank. It could be Charlottesville. Should it be any of these horrific things that have happened where right wing people got together and protested versus what happens with the left. I think it's a lot of it is just people wanting to be a part of a group. People wanting to be a part of this, uh, this thing that gives them, they have this feeling of being in a tribe and solidarity and, and they go along with whatever the ideology is that tribes pushing opposite.

Speaker 1:          10:14          And that means such a danger because he's, you know, that sense of belonging is something that all human beings crave to one degree or another. And sweets. The same thing that make people join cults is the same theme that would make people join some hardcore political position is the same thing that make people join bike guy. It's the same mentality, right? Is we need to, as our tribe, our group with the same clothes, with the same idea as we stand for because he feels good to have other people embrace. He was one of them, or three t well as a result, but of course the price to pay is your individuality.

Speaker 2:          10:51          Okay. [inaudible].
