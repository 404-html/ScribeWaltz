Speaker 1:          00:00          You know, it's good too, is the rap. You know, some guys going to fight, you know, like rapping. Well, no, it's, I used to beat guys like you up on the way to a fight. Practice fall on asshole. You know that shit. I like that. Just like in basketball, you know that the, the uh, trash talk, trash and toxic. Yeah. Sometimes it works. Does the thing about when someone gets inside your head, someone's really lucky that I was kind of thinking that when you see listing and I'll, right, yeah. How could, like it looked like listen, was like afraid of him. How could he be? Well, you know, you go back, the reason why, and this is, Ali did this on purpose. He acted like a crazy person because he's like that Sonny Liston was a bully and Sonny Liston was a big scary man. And what he felt like sunny lists it would be afraid of is a crazy person.

Speaker 1:          00:50          Someone who was afraid of him. So in all the press conferences and all the different things leading up to the fight, he would scream at them. He would show up at Sonny Liston, his house and honked the horn in the middle of the night and get on his lawn and scream and yell at him. Like he did a lot of crazy shit to sunny, listened to fuck with them psychologically he wanted Sonny and he did it. He did it psychologically. They didn't want it. Sonny Liston to think that he was a crazy person and that you know, that he would never stop. Yeah. And that's, I mean he essentially did it and there was one point in time when they were, um, see we just let me hear some of this.

Speaker 1:          01:29          He, he laid him down. He let him know he wasn't scared of him and they were doing his blood pressure and his blood pressure was so high. As heart rate was so high, they weren't going to let them find them like doing sunny. Oh No. Ali's, he had a calm himself down cause he got himself worked up into a lather. He was just so, so angry and so, you know, so hyped up trying to act like a crazy person. Then when they were doing it's pre-fight medicals, they were like, hey, you know, like you can't fight your fucking, there's something wrong with you. And they had this, here it is. They're calming him down.

Speaker 1:          02:04          He had to relax and calm down. I don't know. Greatest, greatest of all time. I beat him all. He was just so, so smart at like psychological warfare. There'd never been any anybody like him psychologically that could just, he would, he, first of all, he was very funny. He would say hilarious shit. Like Howard Cosell said to him, tramp it champion seem very trucky let, and he goes, whatever on it is, if it's good on that, the timing was just perfect. He was so, he would, you know, say things that were funny. He would say poetry. He had that Guy Bundini Brown behind him and they were always, you know, there were always like laughing and joking around together. Like he had a tremendous support team and on top of that he could fight his fucking ass off. And he was a heavyweight that moved around like a middleweight.

Speaker 1:          03:00          Unbelievable. I mean, he was a 200 plus pound, 215, 220 pound man. And he would shuffle and move and Bob and weave and he would be out there almost like a welter winning. He's the greatest. He's a boy. It's hard to say who's the greatest heavyweight of all time, but he's certainly in the conversation. I mean, you would have to say, how would he have done against some of the bigger, stronger guys of the past? Like a Lennox Lewis who, uh, you know, was in his prime in the high 240 pound range. She was a much bigger, much bigger guy, but there was nobody left. See, Ali also comes in two stages. There's Ali before 1967 when they took his license away. And this is Ali. After 1970 when he came back and when he came back, he was never as fast. He was never as fleet of foot cause he didn't work out at all for three years. He didn't do shit now. And when he came back, his return fight, um, uh, he just didn't look right. He didn't look like he had the same movement. His body didn't have the same musculature. He just, uh, he fought. Um, Jerry, no, it wasn't very core. Jerry quarry, that's what it was. And he beat him. He beat him up, but he just didn't look like then the homily that fought like go to boxing matches. Yeah. Yeah. I'll still go to boxing matches.
