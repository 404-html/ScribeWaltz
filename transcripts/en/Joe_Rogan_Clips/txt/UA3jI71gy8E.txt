Speaker 1:          00:00          Um, out of all the years you've been doing your show and all the years you've been given advice. Ha. How did this catch me outside girl? How did this happen? All good. I know all the different shows. But you made a monster. Uh, no, I mean it's my moment of infinity. No, seriously.

Speaker 2:          00:24          This girl comes home with her mother and her mother actually brings her own of course. And she's a train wreck and we work with her and we send her to this ranch for like four months. Right. She goes for a long time and makes a complete turnaround, does a really a great job. They say she's become a leader. She's working with all these girls doing a great job. And then she graduates and I remember this last shot when we do this, this piece at the ranch, she jumps up on this fence and is smiling and everything and waving it all one night home with her mother one night. And her mother's finding people that are trashing her, the mother on, on uh, the social media platforms. Her mother tracks him down, backs into who they are, gets their phone numbers, calls him up, yelling into the phone, calling them names and stuff, gets the daughter involved, one night crashes.

Speaker 2:          01:27          So they come back for a followup like, I don't know, month or two later. And when they come I say, okay, we're going to have him back. They walk out, I have the audience completely empty. I have nobody there to play too. I mean, 250 chairs, empty, nobody in the house, but me, the mother and the daughter, that's a good move. And they go, whoa, where is everybody's? Well, you don't need anybody. We're just here to talk and you know, keep things rolling. Right. And they were dumbstruck, they, there was nobody there to showboat for play too. And there's like a 15 minute interview. They had nothing to say. And off they go. And then this phrase that got turned into a, you know, whatever, a meme or whatever they call it, um, it just went crazy. And what she was nominated for a grammy or

Speaker 1:          02:24          Siri. I'm serious. Uh, so I'm, I take no credit or blame. I, you know, I just did what I could and haven't seen her saying, I wish everybody, well maybe she'll turn so maybe it'll grow her up. She'll turn some paucity valve. But I hope so. Well that's a very good attitude. Very healthy attitude for you. But it is when something goes viral like that, something strange that for whatever reason it catches and takes off. It's, it doesn't make any sense. It's a very weird thing. It makes no sense. She's on a billboard on sunset, a giant billboard. Oh really? Huge. Enormous billboard. It's like one of those sides of the building billboards where they, you know, they put the graphic up and it covers the entire building.

Speaker 2:          03:08          It makes no sense. Seriously. Seriously. And there's people curing cancer and you can't find him with both hands.

Speaker 1:          03:15          Exactly. Nobody has any idea who won the last Nobel Prize for science,

Speaker 2:          03:20          but you know, more power to her. I, if, if she can turn into something positive that she have talent. Have you ever heard any of her music now?

Speaker 1:          03:28          I have no idea. I've either seen her on your show. Thank you. I appreciate you bringing that up. Sorry. But it's just so strange that one train wreck could for whatever reason, catch on and then all of a sudden it's gigantic.

Speaker 2:          03:45          Yeah. They say that somebody signed her and paid her millions of dollars seriously. Like

Speaker 1:          03:50          close to a million dollars from a makeup company. Really? Yeah. Oh, well, okay. There you go. I mean, if that's happening, right, like what would your advice be then? Would your advice be, Hey, get your shit together and stop being crazy? Well, she's making a lot of money off of being crazy and her opportunities before that were probably severely limited.

Speaker 2:          04:12          Well, they had to be. And what I hope now that this, even though this certainly is a quirk, what I hope now is that she's surrounded by mature people with business heads on their shoulders and development people that will actually guide this in a way that it's not 15 minutes. Yeah. You never know. You know? That's what I hope.

Speaker 1:          04:36          Well, everybody thought the Kardashians are going to be 15 minutes and it's been 15 years.

Speaker 2:          04:40          Yeah. But there's been, you know, people make fun of them and there's some good things here to make fun of. They do things to be made fun of. But there's also from very smart business and branding that's gone into that as well.

Speaker 1:          04:55          Oh, 100%. And you know, and I was actually very impressed with her that she actually went to the White House to talk about prison reform for people that are unjustly accused and are being been in jail for too long for things that they didn't do. And that's something she's actually passionate.

Speaker 2:          05:10          Yeah. And I know Kim and she's actually a very nice girl, very smart and all. And as I say, they've done some very brilliant branding and it's certainly paid off.

Speaker 1:          05:20          It's just so fascinating when something catches like that girl, what is her name? The catch man of science?

Speaker 2:          05:25          Uh, Danielle goalie or something? Yeah. Yeah. Cause I didn't know her as the catch me outside,

Speaker 1:          05:34          but if she didn't say that one phrase.

Speaker 2:          05:37          Yeah. And she just said that I think to her grandmother or somebody in the audience. I know it didn't even register with us at the time. Wow. It was, it wasn't a standout phrase in the interview or anything. It just pass by. Somebody just grabbed it and, and then it became a meme. Yeah. What a weird world we live in. Yeah, no kidding.
