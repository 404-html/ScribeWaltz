Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience, years of years of competition, you know, all day the problem at the colitis and all that. That's because of that, that that bs that I got it like putting too much on me. Normally fight, fight again. It will be, it will go back that same pattern. I will, I will not be, I will be very stressed and it's normal to be stressed, but I will accept it. I accept it better now than I used to do when I was younger. Now after you won the title, there was thoughts of whether or not you would defend it if you were going to fight Robert Whitaker, like what you were going to do, what, what caused your decision? What made you decide to relinquish the belt? So the reason why I relinquish your belt is ag. I went to do some physical tests to see what, what, what does that problem with my El Condition?

Speaker 1:          00:46          Because during the, the Cap I knew I had problem. I didn't know what it was. I knew it was, you know, that tests, the blood tests and everything for the cancer, it came negative. So after I went to do like, like I say, colonoscopy, it came back that I uh, no sorry, inside my stomach that as a doctor I say how long it takes to get rid of this is I is whole your life. But the symptom, the symptom can go up, down, depending every people, whatever they do differently. Then I started researching was the best doctor I'll can I do this. And that's when I started reading about like the fasting and stuff and I, and I then I, then I tried it, but I saw that a lot of it in that sport of MMA, a lot of the guys are a starving day.

Speaker 1:          01:31          They know they're not hungry, they are not rich. You know, I'm lucky now have enough money for the rest of my life. I don't need to fight anymore. You know, if I don't do nothing crazy like buying a private airplane and I'm not that kind of person or falling into drugs and stuff and I, I think I'm good, you know, for me, my family and everything, I think I'm good. However APP when I'm looking at the landscape, I say a lot of guy, like for example, condo met Gregory, he hold on to the title two to 40 attention the sponsors at this and that, and I love people do that. That kind of, they kind of stole the division. And I'd said to my side, I said, you know what I stand for, for the fighters always did, you know, and publicly as her, why am I gonna keep that title until to see if I feel better or not and defend it because I don't even know if my leg, my weight that it was dropping down.

Speaker 1:          02:22          It's like I, I'm not even, no one 85 or a Memoriam one 70 or one 50 Fiverr's I'm not, I don't have the size of a one 85 hours. So I'm like, I, I relinquished it right away. You know, I don't want to install the division and make people wait because of me and that they're the, well, don't go around me. You know what I mean? So far, the respect I did, I did it, but I didn't know before the fight I was going to do it is it happened like [inaudible] like this people, I was like, oh yeah. You know, not knowing. No, I did. I didn't know he was going, I didn't know it was going to have it called ids and all that stuff. He, it came up, I never tried it before. I didn't know what would be the outcome, how I would feel.

Speaker 1:          03:01          I never did it. You know, it was a test. And this same, no bad. I didn't know. You know, I have a lot of, uh, I'm not a perfect man. Joe Have a lot of, uh, negative stuff about me. My one thing that I'm not, is, I'm not a coward. This I where if I say I'm going to do something, I'm going to do, I'm not a coward, you know, and every of my fight, every of my fight I was, I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm terrified. But whatever. I feel, I step. And I, and I, I, uh, I respect Mike on trek and I do it, you know, and, um, I didn't, I didn't know the colitis and all that. It was, it would be illogical right now if we, if I want to go back when I'm ready to go back one, eight five, I'm not one 85, you know?

Speaker 1:          03:42          Right, right. It would be a stupid move. And so if you're gonna fight again and it'd be one 70 or one 55 yes. What were, were you leaning? Are you leaning towards 55 or 70 I don't know. I, I'm, I'm Leah, I'm gonna. I want to lean. We're, if I, I want, you know what af climb the Everest many times. You know, I've climate, once I lose to Matt Hughes and I climate too, I loosed, I then I, then I got it, then I lose to Matt Serra. I climate again. I've done it like three times. And you're like, I'm 37 years old. I just turned 37 few, few days ago. I don't want to have much less. Right. And the far what have left. I want to make the, the, the big fight that fight, that the fan want to see, they want to enjoy. Um, I also want personal need for me to achieve something that is unique, that is rare, that maybe that never been attempted before. You know, that would be something that excites me. And I'm not only driven by money, you know, like, like, like a, it's good to have money. We like money. It's, it drives us all, including myself, but it's not the unique thing that drives me. It need to be more than money and they need, need to be some kind of achievement that comes with it. That would exciting me.

Speaker 1:          05:15          Okay.
