Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah, I'm one of the, I have this theory and we see it in sports and I saw it when I talked to him and he's been a friend of mine for a long time and I was talking to him about his psychology is he goes into a football game and he says he plays a movie in his mind of the entire game before he plays it. Because you know, in a football game you're going to have 11 or 12 possessions during the game and you just throw that football game. You can get that ball 11 or 12 times and he would say, and I'm going to carry that ball three or four times per possession, and he knows which plays he's going to run. He would run him through his head, he would see it, he would know who was going to be there to tackle him.

Speaker 1:          00:40          He would, you know, he'd run everything through his head and he's one of those guys that wants the ball when the clock's running out. But I have this theory that situations do not make heroes situations expose heroes. And I saw that in Katrina, the hurricane that so devastated that that one neighborhood, what ward was it does it the ninth ward, and I forget which ward it was that got so wiped out, uh, when Katrina hit New Orleans and there was a guy down there that had been really quiet. Nobody had ever heard anything out of him. He was an older guy, lived in a house, stayed to himself. And that night when the water was at rooftop level, I mean he swam rooftop to rooftop and save six, seven, eight people got 'em out of there and he didn't make it out, but he got seven or eight people out of there and you go back and you check his history and he was a military hero.

Speaker 1:          01:47          He just sat quietly in his home. And when the situation came about, it revealed who he was. And I think that's what happens. I think if you've got a hero, they just sit there, sit there and sit there until the situation reveals who they are. I don't think it makes him a hero. I think it reveals that they're heroes. And I think that's what happens to people. They, they are who they are until they get in, in the opportunity to comes along and they're going to show you who that is and they may show you are a coward or they may show you that they've got the focus to hang or they may show you that they're a hero, but life circumstances are going to come along and we're going to show you who somebody is. Yeah, I completely agree. And I think what's also interesting is when someone does get revealed to be a coward, they can become a hero.

Speaker 1:          02:41          It's very hard. It's very hard to get past the memory of you being a coward. Well, I'll tell you why I think that's true. If you want to know please. I mean maybe I'm going away, going off on a tangent. Come on now I think. I think learn about ourselves and yo everybody talks about self esteem and self worth, but nobody ever talks about what it really is or how we get it. And I think I think about it in terms of self attribution because you know how you form opinions of other people. Like if you look at this guy and you, you maybe you work with this guy and so you watch him across a couple of years and maybe this guy shows up to work every day and he's there 15 minutes early and he unlocks the place, gets everything ready, puts a coffee on, has his desk ready, he's all buttoned up and Ma'am when the bell rings he's ready to go.

Speaker 1:          03:38          And you, you just learned that this guy's buttoned up, ready to go. Dependable never misses. He's always there. So you attribute certain traits and characteristics to him based on your observations of him and your experience of him based on that you assign certain traits and characteristics to him. But I say that's exactly the same way we form our own self image and our own level of self worth. We watch ourselves go through life and we watch how we handle certain circumstances and situations. And that's why I say overindulgence is one of the most insidious forms of child abuse Mellon to parenting. Uh, it's not the worst. It's just insidious because if you overindulge your children and do everything for them, you never let them observe themselves, master their environment. You never let them step back and say, wow, I did that, I built this, I overcame that, I handled this, I did that.

Speaker 1:          04:43          And so we, that's the same way we make our own self image and level of self worth. We watch ourselves overcome the third grade. We watch ourselves stand up to a bully, we watch ourselves handle a test with the information that intimidated us or we watch ourselves make it onto the little league baseball team and actually get a hit when we needed to. Where we watch ourselves get on to the debate team and actually argue something successfully, whether it's academic or athletic or musical. We watch ourselves do it. And so we'd go back and say, Hey, I did that. I attribute to myself the ability, I can hang, I can do this, I can rise to the occasion. Or we watch ourselves fold like a pup tent in a windstorm and say, I can't hang out. I don't have it. And we make those attributions to ourselves.

Speaker 1:          05:40          And so we strength from the challenge for the rest of our lives until like you said, it's hard to overcome that and something pushes you up until you finally observe yourself overcome something. And I think that's how we form our level of self esteem and our identity about who we are. And I don't think most people think about that. Look back and say, okay, how did I, how did I get to be Joe Rogan has a sit in that chair. You have a self image, you have a level of confidence, ego, strength, uh, a level of self worth that's attributable to things you've watched yourself do or not do, achieve, not achieve, overcome or whatever throughout your life. And, and I think to know yourself, you have to know what those things are.

Speaker 2:          06:28          I think you're 100% right. And I think for children participating in things that are going to test you so critical, giving them this opportunity to realize that the, the, there's a line between success and failure and that you could push through that line and you could, you could become successful at something and learn watching kids at. That's why I think sports are so important for children. I think that's one of the more insidious things about having these participation trophies for kids where that nobody wins the game. Yay. Everybody plays, but nobody wins. We don't keep score. Well, why the fuck are you plan? Yeah. I mean that just goes down as an environmental non event. Yeah. I mean that that contributes nothing to your definition is just something to do. It's also psychologically it's coddling. It's very, it's very damaging for your potential education that you would get from that situation. The bad feeling that you get when someone scores on you is motivation for you to be better at defense.

Speaker 1:          07:26          Yeah. You know, I think we cheat kids when we do that and of course you gotta play everybody. I get that not everybody is meant to be an athlete, so, okay, look, go do something else. Be Good at what you're good at.

Speaker 2:          07:41          Yeah. And if you really want to do it well, you've got a long road. It's a greased hill start running.

Speaker 1:          07:48          Yeah. It's just everything's not for everybody. So find what you're good at and watch yourself achieve in that lane. You know, that's like I could, I can't carry a tune in a bucket. I, I can't even, I can play no instrument. I can't sing. I can play a radio if it's got a big on off knob. That's it. And so I don't try, I mean that's, I'm just not good at that. So I go into lanes that I can do stuff and observe myself in that. But I think you cheat kids if you don't let them observe themselves face adversity and overcome it.

Speaker 2:          08:23          Absolutely. And it's also an interesting lesson to learn that life isn't fair. I mean, if you're a kid and you're playing basketball with a 15 year old Lebron James and you're my height, you go, Huh, yeah. This ain't gonna work out at all. Yeah, you're looking at a towel boy here. This is not fucking happening. And you have to be able to understand that and appreciate that. And then conversely, if you're very physically frail, you know, maybe wrestling's not for you either. You know, maybe, maybe you, uh, we need to do something about your body before you engage in any sort of a combat sport. You know, they did an experiment,

Speaker 1:          09:01          I think it was the 60s they did something called teaching machines. Have you ever seen that? It was a short period of time, but they, they took students in the class where they put the steps of learning the information so close together that there was never a failure experience. It would say like the war of 1812 happened in 1812. Then the next thing would say the war of 1812 happened in blank. You fill in 18, 12. I mean, come on. Potted plant could get that. So they've put it together and they would teach the information and they would teach it to criteria where you mastered the information. You had it 100% and I said, wow, this is great. Everybody learned it. So everybody made a hundred, everybody got the information, they truly did learn it. There was no question about it. They learned the information and so they did great.

Speaker 1:          09:56          And then they took him out of that program and put them back in the regular classroom. And the first time they came to questions, they didn't know the answer to the first time they didn't get a hundred they came apart like a cheap suit. They panicked, they didn't know how to handle adversity, they didn't know how to handle it when they didn't have the right answers, they didn't learn how to not be perfect. And so they scrapped the whole program because he said you can't do this because that's not the way life is. Right. And if I mean it's, you're not teaching how the real world works, you might as well teach them to go on red and stop on green and then give them the keys and put them out in life. Cause that's not the way it works. And those kids were absolutely screwed up when they got into a truly competitive environment. It can't be success only.

Speaker 2:          10:48          Yeah. It doesn't make any sense. It's not healthy. It's not good for you. You don't learn from it. I mean, the whole idea about school is you're supposed to be setting kids up for the future. He supposed to be teaching them not just information, but teaching them how to learn and

Speaker 1:          11:02          prove. Yeah, and that worries me. You know, I read that story not long ago when you students, I think it was at Ucla in law school, complained and got a professor either disciplined or fired because he required them to take a counter argument over something controversial like Ferguson. He said, I want you to, you know, I know you that you're all on this point of view. Now I want you to prepare an argument for the other side. And they all said, ah, that's, that's upsetting to us. We just can't do it. And they went to the administration and complained.

Speaker 2:          11:44          Wow, that's crazy. Because you may have to do, as a lawyer, you may have to represent someone who's done something you don't agree with. If that's what you want to do for a right. I mean,

Speaker 1:          11:54          are you kidding me? They were like needed therapy. Uh, my, what the hell has happened here? Oh my God. That's so crazy. That's nuts.
