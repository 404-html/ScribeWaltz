Speaker 1:          00:00          Kids died a lot. Yeah. Then Dad died from injury and sickness and a lot of people died from sickness, you know, no vaccines when you just said the mercy. And then also it's the beginning of agriculture. So all these diseases are emerging that we don't have immune systems for it because they're being, they're being jumped from like they're there, they're jumping from pigs to people. They're jumping from chickens and birds to people. That's where the source of most of these pandemic diseases come from. It comes from large scale agriculture. Those funky pigs all tucked together in these little cages. That doesn't come for free. Like there's some demons are being brewed in that mix. Yeah. Like this, this, what was this? What was the source of, um, the Spanish flu, which I think was the most deadly epidemic in u s history. Oh, is that right?

Speaker 1:          00:50          It was international to, was international for sure. I think for sure it was the most deadly epidemic in the u s yeah. But I think he came, I don't think it came from Spain. I think I want to say it came from somewhere around Virginia. Does that bullshit. This is going to take time probably in New Jersey. I feel like it came from some sort of farm situation. I don't know why I feel like, I'm guessing that surprised it's not more of that now because you see some of these like pig farms and they have links. There are lakes of waste. If you seen the drone footage, is that what we're talking about? Oh my God. Some guy fluid, you know, cause they have these ag gag laws, which apparently one of them just got shot down a, somebody sent me an email that some, maybe it was Idaho or Iowa, one of those places.

Speaker 1:          01:43          One was I states that uh, the uh, ag gag laws got shutdown. The AG gag laws are safe. You are working in a slaughterhouse when you saw horrific conditions, you got your cell phone out, you filmed it, you could get prosecuted, you would go to jail, you could be sued because if walking, all those documentaries that came out. Well it's the, I think those ag gag laws existed as soon as they figured out that people could film thing. You know, because a few people released videos of her and it looked, those ag gag laws kept, you know, kept people from talking about a lot of creepy shit like this video. If you see this video, this guy decided since no one's going to give him access to film, the place openly, she's gonna fly over it. So he flew over with a drone Spanish flu thing.

Speaker 1:          02:31          Okay. For many years, medical historians and epidemiologists hypothesize that the outbreak could have started in a British army base in [inaudible] France or at Fort Riley in Kansas where the first American cases of the new strain of flu were recorded in March of 1918 more recently, experts have experts have proposed a third hypothesis. The Spanish flu originated somewhere in northern China in late 1917 and swiftly move to eastern Europe within 140,000 Chinese laborers and, uh, the French and British governments recruited to perform manual labor to free up the troops for war time duty. Wow. Yeah. I think more people died of that. Then they die then died in world war one fifth. So 50 million people were killed because of this damn, whoa. Just think about courses. A 50 million people looking at reclaiming. Look at this. It says, claiming more lives in a single year than either the first world war or the four year long black death, bubonic plague outbreak that swept Europe and Asia in the Middle Ages.

Speaker 1:          03:40          And this is one that, for whatever reason, people talk about the plague. They talk about the bubonic plague. Look, everyone's heard of, but no one talks about the Spanish flu. Like that's a rare, it's not. It doesn't get brought up that often. If you see this number, this number of people die, 50 million people in a year, in a year. Man. People talk about how bad that we're saying is right now, but that's not what they're saying. They're saying that killed more lives in a single year than either the first world war or the four year long black death may have killed, and that he may have kept one third of the population was sick with it. At least they didn't all die. God Damn.
