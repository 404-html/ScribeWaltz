How much like that football team dynamic is just the whole thing. Yeah. It's like human beings love to get into a stadium, be like red team, blue team, identify with one team and lose their freaking minds. Literally lose their minds and that's when they know it's meaningless when they know it's just about a ball crossing a line. And this is, this has absolutely no, we'll still bring God into it. We'll bring that team into it. All these, and again you see like with this Trump thing now that he just stepped on, me and Jamie were joking around before we started like a where it's like he, he liked threatened nuclear war and insulted Steph curry in in one thought I'd ever, everyone in America is like, excuse me, what was that second excuse?

I mean Lebron James is making videos about the president of being a douchebag. He's making videos about all these different people like expressing their right to free speech. I saw one of the tweets that he, uh, he tweeted out at the president where it was like, just kind of like a broken English tweet. Like he used the word ain't a lot in it and it's just him verse Trump. And I just had a moment where I was like, so this is where the national conversation is at now. Like, do you remember, I just remember watching like a William F. Buckley versus Gore v down debates and you're like, how fucking retarded has our country gotten? Have you seen those? The documentary? Yeah. It's amazing. Really interesting. If you haven't seen it focuses on Netflix. What is it called? Something I don't remember. Bitter rivals. Yeah. No, that's something that's called bitter rivals. That might have been a UFC event back in the early two thousands [inaudible] Sylvia, three best of enemies. Best of enemies. Thank you.
