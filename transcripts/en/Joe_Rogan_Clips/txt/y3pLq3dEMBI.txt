Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello

Speaker 2:          00:02          bitches. You know, one of the things when we were talking about that I think is kind of important, like when you're talking about um, immigration and like bad apples and stuff like that. I look at immigration as same way. I look at gun control. Like most people that have guns are law abiding citizens and it's not going to be a problem. The vast, vast majority, and I think that's the same case with immigration and the same case of people coming to America, even the illegally, they want to do better. That's why they're coming here. They're not coming here because they want to start crying. Sure. They, most of them are coming here because they want opportunity.

Speaker 3:          00:32          It's with guns. I totally agree. I want a shotgun so badly when I needed a double barrel, like I don't want to shotgun and I'm, I've shot a lot of guns should, especially with the daily show, I've done shot guns for the daily show.

Speaker 1:          00:46          You guys going to be telling jokes? Going to have to learn how to fucking clear room out and defend yourself. Okay. All right. Now, this is a Thompson machine gun discipline. Very important for the daily Cheryl,

Speaker 3:          00:58          not 50 caliber sniper busters. 50 calibers are ridiculous. Dude, I will show you a video after this. Uh, actually maybe this hasn't really even aired because it was part of a pilot that I did that did. I did a pilot for comedy central when I left the daily show. It was an anti travel show called displaced sucks.

Speaker 1:          01:20          I didn't go, dude, I'll send it to you. Great idea. Just the con

Speaker 3:          01:23          dude. It's the fucking funny. You know what they said? What you mean? Everybody said it was too mean. It's fucking hilarious. I go, we stayed in Kansas City. I go, hey everybody, my name is Al Madrigal. I'm in Kansas City. I'm going to tell you why this place sucks.

Speaker 1:          01:38          Just shit all over it and it just, just do that online. Oh yeah. I should just put them out 20 minutes. A great idea for all things comedy. Why don't you just like buy or make idea? I totally just do you own the idea? My idea? Oh my God, that's a great idea. So that idea, like as soon as you set it up, you know, someone says an idea and a light bulb goes off, easy show, real id. And I do it and see it. Francisco

Speaker 3:          01:59          and I'd do it to San Francisco is fucking filthy. It is one of the dirtiest cities I've ever been through in my entire life. And also it's like filled with rich douche bags now because of the, you know, Internet boom. And then all of this tech boom and the poor people are getting moved out. There's so much stuff to make fun of. So anyway, I'm hate kind of a, I went to this place oh and be guns and I shot and machine guns, handguns, like a shot, everything. And then for the daily show I went and I saw it was, I drove a tank, I got to drive tanks. I was doing this chieftain tanks that I was driving. I got to run over to Saturn's in a tank. Really? Yeah. It's fucking awesome. How do you drive a tank? Like, what do you, what do you not, yeah, it's levers and there's uh, so um, yeah, you could watch it.

Speaker 3:          02:44          And there was this hot chick that they had that was working there that was on it with me and at the same place I got to fire machine guns, but I feel like when it comes to automatic weapons and a 50 caliber sniper and all that shit, I don't understand why you need to own that. I liked shooting it. I'll go shoot that stuff again. I really enjoyed it. He couldn't see me shoot that 50 caliber thing. Like there was a shockwave or yeah, like your, your head flies but you couldn't watch my arms and the skin on my arms ripple after I fucking hurt cause I, I wore a sleeveless shirt to shoot it. Boom. Wow. And uh, I enjoyed it. I liked shooting that shit and I want the shotgun to defend my house when everything goes to hell. Yes. I'm be apocalypse and a shotgun.

Speaker 3:          03:36          I want just somebody to here get the fuck away from the door. You know what I have by my bed right now? Hammers Hammer. I have a hammer, like bill makes fun of me. Like he thinks it's the craziest thing. Like you keep it by your bed. I keep a hammer under my bed, like I'm going to fucking get up and close in contact. Like hammered somebody's death. Yeah. And it seems like you thought it through, like really, really like on a surface level. I have a magnum flashlight and I can't fly magnum flashlight. Yeah. Peter, that always kills me when people think they're going to clubs. Somebody with flashlight. No, no, I want to, I'm a flashlight in one hand. So blind them and then fucking running. Hammer. Hammer. Why not a real weapon? I want a real one. I got knives. I have all close contacting me. Never got a gun on my wife so I can oh, one of them. Yep. Hmm. Well I'll get one. I'm working on her. She's good. She gets it. Yeah. We've got to do as a false flag in the house. Hire some friends. [inaudible] oh yeah, that's a good idea.

Speaker 3:          04:41          Not False flag. Really. The Dick Cheney of households. Oh my God. So, um, yeah I want the gun badly. But I feel like with an AK 47 and maybe you know, people can write like only bad things have happened. People, you know, a district is responsible gun owners. But you look at Dylan roof and you look at, you know, column when you look at all these people getting shot up everywhere and seeing the hook, like I don't want that to happen. I don't want my kids. I was walking away safe. You put your guns in a safe. Why do you need an AK 47 you don't need an AK 47 I'm saying and have all the handgun. But the thing is like who should be able to decide who gets what. That's where it gets weird. Yeah. And what about silencers to, well, here's the thing. In, in Europe silencers are thought of as a polite thing because we're over in America worried about shooting people.

Speaker 3:          05:36          They're worrying about noise. So like if you have what they call suppressor, they call suppressor. Like if you're hunting, you would hunt with a suppressor on because you don't want to blow your fucking ears out. Man, I'll put the links out to these two pieces that I did a daily show spots. I'll do the one. If you go to my thing, that Twitter, uh, I'll, uh, I'll put it on. I'll send them to you though when I drove a tank and fired all those guns. And then I did a silencer piece as well. And the guy was saying he wanted to protect kids ears with the silencers. And that's what Donald Trump jr saying kids. And I'm worried. The reality is though, and this is true, I know a lot of friends that are hunters that shot guns as kids and they're fucked up now. They're ears are a mess.

Speaker 3:          06:20          Would it, should they wear the, they should, but they didn't when they were younger because they didn't know any better. See, 20 years ago, people didn't know that you were going to do permanent damage to your ear. They didn't, you didn't need ever heard about it like these people just shotguns. But I think also the, uh, unfortunate reality now is that you could have somebody walking around undetected shooting fucking shooting people in a college and you could call it, yeah, I did. I was on Kcrw and walking around the Santa Monica campus and I really did think, I'm like, okay, who's the shooter? Right. Coast water. And then it shouldn't be a thought that, oh no, it shouldn't. Yeah. I mean it's a mental health issue, but because like the only person that's capable of doing that as a person who's sick. Yeah. You know, and that's the other thing that doesn't come up when you're talking about mass shootings is whenever you hear about it, the news, no one, he makes the correlation, the inescapable correlation between psychoactive drugs and mass shootings because there's a lot of fucking mass shooters.

Speaker 3:          07:21          Like almost all of them that are either on pharmaceutical drugs like SSR, i's disassociative drugs, or they're getting off of 'em antipsychotic drugs. There's a look and be done is you're like, there is no common ground. He started having people make, we live in this country where you should be able to do whatever you want, uh, and have whatever you want. But then who gets to decide? Who gets questioned? What guns? Well, Texas has sort of taking the idea that just everybody has a gun, a wheel armed society is a polite society. My Ron white all of a sudden, and then teachers should have guns in the classroom and bulletproof helmets, full vests. Jesus. Ak 47 is right there, right there. Put down the chalk. I don't know, man. It sucks. Yeah, it's actually, you have to think about it. There's no easy solution. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          08:13          Well it just, every time one of those things happens, everybody buckles down and wants to take away guns and try to figure out legislation. And I just feel like the root of the problem is not the tools that people are using. It's the fact that someone's willing to use those tools. The fact that someone is willing to do that, the fact that those guns are more accessible is a g is a genuine issue. But I think we can all agree that no one came for the guns. Uh, Obama. Every, it's like Obama's coming for the guns. What do you know why he knows the NRA, the NRA is too strong. The lobbies to strong, they've spent a shit load of money and continue to spend a shitload of money to make sure they protect the second amendment rights. But so you're saying if they will, if not for the NRA, it 100%

Speaker 2:          08:56          per second. All the guns, they would have definitely done something similar to what Australia did. Australia essentially made gun ownership very, very, very difficult. They took away guns, they enact a very strict laws and they had like one mass shooting a long time ago. They're big mass shooting a long time ago. That's the thing that they don't have is like these big mass shootings, you know when you see. But Australia has the same amount of people's California and it's the size of the United States. Yeah. They just just saw the thing. There was a map comparisons and fill your mind. It's like it's the exact same size. Yeah, it's crazy. And people are spread. It's way spread out and it's the same amount of people is Los Angeles and it's in this giant ass fucking country. So when you think about being able to take people's guns in Australia, it's different.

Speaker 2:          09:41          The culture is different. The idea of independence is different over there. We have a different attitude over here. Yeah. I just don't want to one. Yeah. When you have little kids again, she's your course changes, you know, and she's like, I don't ever, why worry about them growing up in a society where a teacher does have to think about wearing a fucking helmet. Of course, of course. I mean, nobody wants to think that. I don't know what the solution is, but the solution, look getting the guns away from the people. There's more guns and there are human beings in America and they're not, they're not going to stop making guns. No. It was good business. Yeah. I the guns of the problem. I really don't. I mean I support gun ownership. I really do. I just started. I don't think that's the issue. I think the issue is lucky that we saw in France in Nice that some crazy fucking take a car and kill a hundred people by plowing over Pete and just starts stabbing people to get out of the car and just fucking starts stabbing folks.

Speaker 2:          10:37          There's, there's ways that people lose their fucking minds and do horrible things to people and the ways are not things you have to take away. You have to figure out a way. And I don't go ale hammers. No. Right. Yeah. I don't know what the solution is, but I don't think anybody does the idea of you see all those guns, I think what you're getting at with the mental health stuff is there, I'm not opposed to there being a screening process and seeing if you have a history of violence. Of course. Yeah. And uh, if you are a show up on a terrorist watch list and that's where I think the NRA goes overboard. It's like if you're on a fucking terrorist watch list, who doesn't agree with that? Well, the only problem with that is who gets to decide who's on the terrorist watch list?

Speaker 2:          11:15          Because there was people that were, um, from, uh, the Green party that were put on terrorist watchlist after nine 11, because they were anti war protesters and they were put on no fly list. There was a lot of weird shit that happened where people were put on lists because they pissed off the wrong people. And you know, in 2001 it was way easier to do something like that, but it is to do it today. Go to buy a gun and then they say, I'm sorry he can't purchase this weapon because you're on that list. And then you can go to a gun show that's part of the problem. Go to a gun show and you could buy a gun far easier and Kansas City and tighten that down though. Kansas, Kansas, you can go and Poop, correct me, I'm wrong, is

Speaker 3:          11:54          did a show called this place sucks. What am I? And so you go to Kansas and then you can get a gun with, no, you don't do, you get into just an Id Kansas Id and you can get it in maybe like five minutes, zero train. It's nothing, just you get it right away. You don't have to have a background check. So true. Yes. Was that true? Like when you did in 2014 when I did this piece? Yeah. But you can look at Queen Queen, check that gun laws Kansas. Come on. No background check. No background check. I'm pretty certain. So why wouldn't you have to scan it in Kansas and this kind of does with his grandma. He walks into this place and he goes, uh, I can't even, the guys says I can't buy the gun, but she can make that he buys these four guns or sub saying kills a bunch of people. So

Speaker 2:          12:47          Federal Law requires federally licensed firearms dealers but not private sellers to initiate a background check on the purchase purchaser prior to sale a firearm. As a result, concealed weapons license holders in Kansas are exempt from the federal background check requirement. Yeah, that's crazy. No training. No background check. Hold on. A second. Concealed weapons license holders like you have to have a concealed weapons license, which is difficult to acquire. And let me, it's not easy to get a concealed weapons license unless they have a different law. Their background checks and cans, it's concealed way, but I think he could. Concealed weapons is like the hardest thing to get is a concealed carry. Federal law provides states with the options of serving a state. Kansas has no law requiring firearms dealers to initiate background checks prior to transferring a firearm. As a result in Kansas, firearms dealers must initiate the background check required by federal law, by contacting the FBI directly. Kansas is not a point of contact state.

Speaker 3:          13:45          Huh.

Speaker 2:          13:45          So they have to contact the FBI. Federal law does not require dealers to conduct a background check of a firearm purchase or presents a state permit to purchase or possess firearms. It meets certain conditions. So it seems like there's definitely some wiggle room. Yeah, yeah, for sure. And then you know, that's her, he was talking about these gun shows where you can just go gobble up a bunch of firearms. They can't, they can bring them into, that's what they just transport them across state lines. And it's one of those things, like many human issues where there's not a whole lot of like clear paths. It's like there's so many guns. You're never going to take them all away from people. And should you take them all away from him? Like if a guy like you as a gun, I don't feel like no danger or a threat unless you get in one of your God damn tirades he might have another best example

Speaker 1:          14:33          that's fucking stealing wood. So

Speaker 2:          14:39          did you hear that bit like a, not a bit of video of Carlos [inaudible] was on Joey Diaz a show saying they thought about bringing a gun around and going to the comedy store and shooting people and he was carrying a gun in his car and like, no, no, I'm crazy.

Speaker 4:          14:53          Well, there maybe you shouldn't never gone. Yeah, he's

Speaker 5:          15:00          [inaudible].
