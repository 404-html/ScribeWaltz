Speaker 1:          00:00          What kind of music you're listening to. I listen to everything that they do. I listen to. I was in a lot of classic rock for whatever reason. But uh, I've been listening a lot of Kanye West over the last few weeks talking about Kanye. Yeah, well he's talking about a lot of crazy shit. He's tired. He actually talked about DMT in one of his recent songs. He did that before. I think he did. Oh Man. Why know he's friends with kid cuddie kid cut. He'd been in here and kid cut. He's had some psychedelic experiences. Yeah. Once you go to is your thumb, you didn't want to do nothing else again. Well, puts it all in the perspective. It lets you see that, uh, as much as this thing seems to be important is all temporary and you're a part of forever and it also allows you to become comfortable with death.

Speaker 1:          00:44          Yeah. Yeah. You know who said that? Larry Hagman remember that Guy Dallas from jr? He did an interview with CNN and I dream of Jeannie as well. Yeah, that's right. He sprung it on him on CNN. Once he was talking about how he did acid, he took a big dose of acid and he's never worried about death ever again. That it just alleviated his, his worry about passing on as wow, this shit that could, I felt the same way I feel I have. It doesn't matter anymore. Yeah. I think DNT even more specifically because they think the mind that way. What causes the effect of mine? That way they don't tell him that his main Gig visioning, visualize everything. They don't totally know. They know that your brain makes it. They know that your body makes it, they should say and they know that it's produced in your liver and their lungs and there's some evidence now cause they found it in rats, that the pineal gland produces it, which is like, that's the third eye of eastern mysticism that Glenn actually in rats, they've proven produces DMT and they think it does so on people too.

Speaker 1:          01:44          You know, once I did, I wanted to do it again and again and again and if they shouldn't do too much of my laugh with me, I got to, you know, grasp what's going on here. Why am I feeling? It's like, why? Why did this in a weird way, like humbled you. I don't think you should listen to the people say you shouldn't, you know too much. I think you just do it as much as you want. That's what I agree with too. Yeah, I agree. You could handle it. If you can handle being like Tyson, you can handle doing DMT issues, EMT. Yeah, that's what I think I'm going, I'm going in that direction. Well, I mean it's not something you just do all day every day, but you can learn a lot from it. It's an and it's, it's very beneficial and very strange that it's illegal.

Speaker 1:          02:18          You know that it's illegal. Yeah. Notice that Mckenna had a joke about it because your body is making it so everybody's holding, we all have it. You know, it's illegal, but it's like making blooded legal. Everybody has. And then why would he go into scenario data when he find these tolls? Yeah. Yeah. I've never experienced it from the toad of owning a television where the way they extract and grab them and they squeezed pimples and they busted on the class a marrow and then take it off and he let it harden. Yeah, they, they let it dry in the sun. They scrape it off with a razor blade. Yeah. I've only had it a synthetically made in a laboratory. You smelled a buy it online. Used to be able to buy like a of fucking can of it. Like this big enough to get like a whole state high.

Speaker 1:          03:04          She's just buy it online. It was totally legal. Credible. Yeah. It's weird design. It is illegal. Well they would say not for human consumption, but I don't know what the fuck are you doing with it if you're not using it for human consumption but you, you used to be able to buy. I've never felt anything like that before. No, nothing like that. Make me not want to do anything. Nothing else can supersede that. How long ago did it happen? Around two months ago. Yeah. Did you write down what happened after it happened or did you record it? No, I wish I did. Yeah, we should that. Yeah, me too. If you like, it goes away like a dream, right? It comes off. You know, you're, you're so scared. You know stuff like this.

Speaker 2:          03:42          No, no, no. Ne, Hey, I want this to stop now. And the guy was like, hey, you're on the right. And I'm like, no, no, no. Yeah, I love it. I love you. I love you. I love you.

Speaker 1:          03:58          Yeah. I'd love everybody. Yeah. So spassed out. Yeah. Did you have a hard time letting go? And the beginning of fighting me, I don't think stop wanting to stop now. Just jump. Stop this shit now stopping. The guy was like, hey, the show. I'm like, I can do it. You got to go for the ride, dude. And it was like, whoa man. Like I'm dying. Things are going in my film theme, the Aztec things. I'm being told, I'm just seeing weird animal. The thing is flying, it's just, it's like another chamber. It's boom flashing. Foom. He'd gone and take a walk. Are you taking off foom yeah. It's beyond your imagination. Yeah. DEF is inconceivable. Can't even explain it to no one. Well, I'm hoping that um, the, they start with psilocybin because a, I know maps there. They're doing some great work with that, trying to get these things legalize especially they're doing MTMA studies with veterans and people with Ptsd and they're having great results.

Speaker 1:          04:57          They're moving into civil side bend. They would love to get silicide been legal and it's up for ballot. I think it was in Oregon. Is that where it is? It's up for, I think Oregon is up for legalization this year and it may be eventually in California as well. They may do addition, it should be legal. It doesn't kill anybody. It should be, it's not a bad thing if they regulate it, if they make it for therapeutic use and just set up centers where experts can show, but they shouldn't make it prohibitive for people to own it or even grow their own. It's not a bad idea to set up places where people can do it under a, a professionals care, a showman's care. Physicians Care, that's a good idea. But making it illegal is a bad idea because it helps a lot of people, you know, people think of it as a party drug. They think you're going to do mushrooms and freak out and go fucking run around naked. And He's do much as I love mushrooms, will psilocybin and DMT or very closely related chemically, all those really potent psychedelic drugs are very closely related. They all break down in some similar path inside your brain and, and give you that, that weird ego dissolving experience. You know, that's one thing.
