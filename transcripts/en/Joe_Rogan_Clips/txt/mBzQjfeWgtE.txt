Speaker 1:          00:00          Now, what do you think about these guys that are talking about bringing animals back? Um, like as a scientist? Sure. De Extinction is, it's a weird word. It is. It is. It's a reintroduction. Is that a better word? They call it the extinctions I would call. That's what they call it. Yeah. De Extinction is, to me it's fascinating, especially if it's something like say the passenger pigeon, right? We used to have billions of them in the United States, wiped him out. Um, and now they're saying, you know, Dick, we can take the closest living relative, uh, isolate some jeans and make a new passenger pigeon. Is that worth it? Cause it's something we wiped out in the last hundred years. Yes. I feel like that's, we should heal the ecosystem by putting that back. Right. That being said, we still need to learn from our mistakes. Like we need to take into account what we did and why we did it.

Speaker 1:          00:51          And like do I think there should be a Jurassic park and a bunch of mammoths and TRX is absolutely not. That's a waste. Whether we can or cannot do it. To me that's a waste of scientific resources that could go towards conserving things that are on the brink. Now, when you say like he'll or men, the environment or the ecosystem, when you would bring back something like a passenger pigeon isn't like 90% of everything that ever existed extinct. Sure, absolutely. So does the ecosystem adjust and evolve and would reintroducing something like a passenger pigeon would it kind of fucked things up that exists now where new animals have taken a different position on the hierarchy? It's too short and evolutionary time. So we are in what's called the sixth mass extinction event, right? There's been five others before us. The one we're in now, it's happening at 80% greater rate than it's ever happened before.

Speaker 1:          01:38          So we are wiping out things more quickly than the world can adapt. So you know, you go into an environment and you take out all the apex predators, the prey explodes, the prey explodes, the grass gets eaten down, everything collapses. Now if you left that environment over time, over evolutionary time, it would adapt, right? Maybe say, say all of the predators got a disease and they died dad out over 300 generations during that time, something would evolve within the environment to adapt the prey so that it didn't wipe out the environment. That's just kind of the nature. It's balance. But when you go in there and do it in 10 years or five years, it throws off the equilibrium. So when you, in theory, when you reintroduce something that's been, and it's not theory, it's, it's science, they've shown this even right here in the California Channel Islands.

Speaker 1:          02:27          When you put something back that's missing from the ecosystem, it's like you're putting a piece of the puzzle back, right? And then you can allow it to do its thing over evolutionary time. What did they do in the channel islands? So I was actually a big part of that and I loved, loved the project. So the California channel islands were settled by agriculture. There were sheeps, goats, pigs, blah, blah, blah. There was everything brought over there. Right? And so not Catalina, but think about the northern channel islands. Um, what happened was when all these animals were brought in, all the farmers were there. Then Golden Eagle started coming over. Golden Eagles came over to eat the pigs and everything else. They flew across the ocean, flew across the channel, started praying on pigs and everything else. There was an animal on the channel islands called the Channel Island Fox. Very gorgeous, cute, cuddly little Fox.

Speaker 1:          03:08          Um, you can see them if you've got a Santa Cruz island, there's loads of them now, thanks to the work that scientists have done. Anyway, they were like, okay, the Fox is being there. It is, isn't it gorgeous? Thanks. So the Fox is being wiped out through habitat destruction through all these undulates that have been brought in. So scientists got together and said, what undulates cows. Yeah, domestic animals, cows, sheep, goats, et cetera. So scientists came in and said, you know, the habitats getting destroyed, the, and that, that's just the keystone. There were several species that were on the decline. The cows are getting, the livestock is wiping out the habitat. The foxes are declining. What did we do? Well, obvious answer. Let's remove all the livestock. So we removed all the livestock, right through helicopters. It was a lot of pigs that were causing damage, all that kind of stuff.

Speaker 1:          03:52          We were moved at all. Then the Golden Eagle started praying on the foxes because their main habitat was gone. So now the foxes are under even more pressure. So then we were moved the Golden Eagles. This is a very abridged version of what happened, but now we've got the Golden Eagles also pushed out the Bald Eagle, which are fish eaters, which lived on the island. So now after loads of years of removing golden eagles, like relocating them, removing all of the livestock, now you have a healthy population of channel island foxes. The Bald Eagles are back there eating fish. The whole ecosystem is back in balance. Had it been left the way it was, what you would have found at the California Channel Islands over say 20 or 30 more years, 40 or 50 more years? No foxes, no, no bald eagles, a ton of Golden Eagles and a ton of pigs. And likely over time pigs would have exploded to the point that they Easter island to themselves.

Speaker 1:          04:36          Right? They ate up all the resources, destroyed, all the habitat. Population collapsed. Golden Eagles collapse, nothing left on the APP. What do you mean by Easter island themselves? So you're familiar with Easter Island and South America? I know what those statues are and all that stuff, but I, I'm not familiar with what happened to Sean. So that island is, was an ancient civilization. That was the Mech. It had everything offline. It had big trees, tons of food, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. People settled there and they said, this place is incredible. It's, it's paradoxical. Um, and then they started cutting down the trees to fish. They started eating all the mammals. And what actually happened is because there were so remote, the middle of the ocean, nowhere near South America, nowhere near anywhere else, they cut down the last tree. There were no more canoes, there was no more food on the island.

Speaker 1:          05:18          And the population collapsed. The island was barren. It was void of trees, void of life, void of anything. And they didn't have the canoes or anything to leave anymore because they cut down the last tree to build, build a boat or make firewood and everybody there died. Oh Shit. So that, that's what happens when you use up every last resource. God. So wow, when did this happen? Uh, I couldn't, couldn't tell you cause I thought it was like a mystery what happened to the population of Easter island. So they, they're pretty, that's yours. That's the accepted, that's the scientifically accepted understanding. Did they get this from fossils? They get this from bones. So they, they've sort of pieced it together. Yup. They took, they take, you know, isotope samples and measure carbon dating and Yadda Yadda. I think that the heads are still a pretty big mystery.

Speaker 1:          06:03          Why I think a certain people believe that the heads were like, uh, an Ale, you know, calling to the gods to help save things cause they were going so badly, Yada Yada. But I believe the heads are still a pretty big mystery. But the actual anthropology, that population, the collapse is, is known to be due to a running out of resource. How long did it go for? Couldn't tell you. Did they have an idea of how long the population lasted? I think it's all, I think it's all published. Yeah. I don't know off the top of my head, but it was, it was a thriving population that flew too close to the sun as they say, because of Easter Island, small size. When he's 63 square miles, it quickly became overpopulating its resources. We're rapidly depleted. When Europeans arrived in Easter island between the late 17 hundreds in the early 18 hundreds it was reported that the more I were knocked down and the islands seem to, did I say that right?

Speaker 1:          06:52          My why being knocked down and the island seem to have been a recent war site. Hmm. Last supplies. Yeah. Let's see. The next one there. Constant warfare between the tribes, lack of surprise, plies and resources, disease, invasive species and the opening of the island to foreign slave trade eventually led to Easter island's collapsed by the 1860s wow. So it didn't take long. 1700 the 1860s that was a wrap. Wow. It was annexed by Chile, and so they've never tried to repopulate the island with trees or anything else, and they're just kind of leave it alone. I believe so. I know you can go there and visit it and see the heads and I think there are some things there now, but it's, it's barren. There are no trees. There's no, you know, it's all been depleted.
