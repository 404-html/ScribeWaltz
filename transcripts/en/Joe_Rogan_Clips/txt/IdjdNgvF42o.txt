Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. So I think there's that. Uh, but then there's also look, you know, like the Colin Kaepernick thing, I think that probably costs a lot of ratings for the NFL.

Speaker 2:          00:12          Did they do that? They're the, yeah. There was that poll that came out that said, I think of the 12% of people who said that they were not watching NFL games last year, 28% of that 12% said that the Kaepernick national anthem thing was the reason. Yeah. I mean it's some small percentage

Speaker 1:          00:25          probably embolden them. They probably liked it and they wanted to watch it more.

Speaker 2:          00:28          This is fascinating about the cultural breakdown of the country. Basically white people hate didn't black people loved it. This is a visitor. This is how the polls where it's like 72% of black people thought it was great and like an equal percentage of white people thought that it was just terrible. And which is it? Which is a fascinating look at that sort of how race relations work in the country at large. Is it? It's actually one of the reasons I think that ESPN has been losing writings. Like I used to watch ESPN religiously and now I, all I want is to just watch my sports and not be bothered with the politics. Right. Cause I say I do that during the day. It's a pet peeve of mine that every time I turn on ESPN I have to hear a lecture about Caitlyn Jenner or about black lives matter. It's like shot up. Caitlin Jenner hasn't even been athletically relevant for since before I was born. I was born in 1984.

Speaker 1:          01:06          Well the Caitlyn Jenner piece, when they did it for ESPN, and I don't know if this is true or not, but the word was that her getting athlete of the year or whatever the award was like the hero of the Year award euro, uh, was directly tied to the exclusive interview with Diane Sawyer. That makes sense. They sold the two of them together as a package deal, which I buy 100%. If you don't, if you don't come on, Liz works. If that's the case where she came from, she's a fucking car dash in. Okay. She's a giant car dash. Yeah, that's, and that's what she is now known as I'm saying she, you know, yeah. You're saying she, I would say very politically correct. Yeah. I'm not, um, but the video where they circled her house and she was like moving in the shadows behind the drapes. Did you ever see that?

Speaker 1:          01:54          No. It was wonderful. It was wonderful. She made, it was like the first time she was revealing herself as this woman. So they're circling her house. She's this Gloria's house and like, it looks like it's in Malibu or somewhere where they're circling the house and it's in the hills with a helicopter like filming. I, it's like fucking high production value shit. This isn't just like, Hey, you know, we met with Caitlin and home Kaitlyn. Tell us your troubles. You know, like Kristen back, the former navy seal who just sits down very reasonably and says, this just feels better for me. This is who I am, right? No, no. There was like curtains and shadows and who's mysterious and and then she starts talking. I was like, like Whoa, God. And then there was a weird, weird is part where she said she got surgery but it doesn't make me any. I was, it wasn't like I was any less of a man or less of a woman before the surgery.

Speaker 2:          02:49          Well, this is the case is about gender. Right. Well then why get the surgery? That was like, this is, well the, there, there are a lot of questions as to the logic of all of this. I get you. You Call Caitlyn Jenner. She, Caitlyn is a biological man. So sorry, get triggered. Sorry to break this to some of the, all the people who listen to your show. Caitlyn Jenner is, I had a tweet this week. All the people that are listening that probably agree with you. Yeah, that's a good book. Good amount. Do the number one retweeted tweet I have ever had, had a hundred and I tweeted, I think a day of going, it has 120,000 likes and it's, it was, there was a headline from CNN that said transgender man gives birth to a trans. What it was it as transgender man, uh, assigned the female sex at birth gives birth to a healthy baby boy.

Speaker 2:          03:30          And so I tweeted, woman gives birth to boy, right, because it's a woman. I mean this like that's not a headline. I'm sorry. Like I'm just, because of the woman believes she's a man, doesn't make her a man. Like biology still exists. Sex still exists. If you want to say she's a woman who feels like a man, that's fine. If you want to say that, I don't even care if she gets hormone treatments or if she wants to have surgery. Like it's a free country, what the hell you want. But when you start insisting that I use that, I just throw biology out the window. I don't understand why that's any better than I is a religious person saying every time you say something you have to mention God, right? Like, well, I don't have the right to do that to you. Like, well that's idiotic.

Speaker 2:          04:06          Are you fascinated by it? Are you fascinated by the transgender? The, I'm fascinated by just society's obsession with it. That's a good way of saying it. There's not just a, an obsession. It's, it's compulsory and it's rabid. So I think that there's a couple of things that are going on. One is that it's, it's very dark, but I think that there is an element of like, this is different and we get to, we get to revel in the, in the weirdness of it. But we're gonna pretend that it's all about the civil rights of it. Right? We're going to feel like special because we're, we're, we're, cause we're on their side watching Caitlyn Jenner because it's a curiosity and because it's weird and entertaining, we're doing it because we're on Caitlyn Jenner's side. But their good about forever. Yeah. Right. I mean Renee Richards was a trans person.

Speaker 2:          04:51          It's happened throughout history. I mean there's, there's, what was I reading a couple of days ago about a Roman, like there was something about reports of a, some trans soldier in the Roman army, you know, boring and thousand years ago it's gotta be, if it's, if exists now and it's existed before it was popular. Yeah. I mean there's gotta be a lot of people that turn trans now just because it's exciting. Oh, there it is. Right there. A Trans Soldier in ancient Roman arm that would of course that it wouldn't be, wouldn't be surprising. I mean, not shocked. No chart. I mean it's a condition. I mean the DSN called the gender identity disorder and then they called the gender dysphoria. It's, it's a condition. I mean like, I'm not saying conditions for you, but that in a lot of people's mind is labeling it somehow or a negative. Well, I mean it is highly linked to suicidality. There's a 40% lifetime suicide rate for people who have this particular gender disorder. That seems to me not to be like great positive. Whether or not they transition, whether or not the transition. Yeah. I mean, and it doesn't, I don't care if you transition to what you want to do, but, but the idea that, that we as an entire society, you have to redefine what sex is. And we have to blind ourselves to a biology is, this is something I'm not willing to do. I think that it's actually damaging to kids, particularly,

Speaker 1:          06:00          I'm more than willing to call her a she and chain, but you can only change your name. One,

Speaker 2:          06:05          I'm willing to call Caitlyn Jenner, Caitlyn Jenner. I'm not willing to call Caitlyn Jenner issue because you can't change your sex and change your name. Right? Can you change it into whatever you want? I don't care. But you can't, she, Caitlyn Jenner is not a chicken. Caitlyn Jenner is not a woman. Caitlin Jenner is a man, a biological man. And if a man lost his penis and it, and Eh, you know, in a, in a tragic accident, it wouldn't make him a woman. And if he were born with a high doses of estrogen in his bloodstream, he would also not be a woman. Right? You already, you are determined by our chromosomes and they're not even talking about intersex people. Like intersex is an actual status intersects is a biological status, but this nonsense that if you Joe Rogan decide tomorrow that you are a woman, no surgeries nor homeowner and the homeowner, nothing.

Speaker 2:          06:43          You just, tomorrow you wake up and not not decide, but you feel like a woman, then you have always been a woman. We must treat you as a woman. You don't have to change anything about yourself for us to even determine whether you're a woman. We just like, no, I'm sorry. No, I mean like I had mental illness. I had a, I had a grandfather I got, I got so much shit for this, but I had, this is not me being unsympathetic to people who suffer from a condition that is really tragic and obviously harms people. You know? In terms of the, again, the rates of suicide and depression are astounding. My grandfather was a, was a bipolar schizophrenia and it would have not been good for him or my family if people had said to him, Nate, you're right, the radio is talking to you, Nate, you're right.

Speaker 2:          07:23          The curtains are talking to you. He went, did they put them in a mental hospital? They gave him with the m and then he was better and he could actually live a normal, relatively happy life. There's no good treatment for gender identity disorder, gender dysphoria or whatever you want to call it, but to suggest that it is a condition that doesn't require treatment there. Really, it's just that you're actually brain female. Again, this is a scientific, there's no scientific evidence to back this whatsoever. Even these studies that have been done talking about, there's a female brain and a male brain. First of all, if you say this to a feminist, you're a sexist, right? Right. If you say to a feminist, there's a female brand in the male brain and male brain works differently than the female brain. The feminist will look you like, how dare you? Well, it's also one, are you

Speaker 1:          08:00          times we are allowed to celebrate classic definitions of female beauty when a man embraces him when he becomes a woman lipstick, high heels, short skirt. This is like

Speaker 2:          08:10          not in general was it k Caitlyn Jenner was only a woman when Caitlyn Jenner was on the cover of Vanity Fair and a boost da. Right, right, right. But if he had just said, listen, I look exactly the same as I did yesterday, but I'm a woman. Yeah. If he got a short haircut and dress like Billie Jean King, right. It's, it's the reason why the, why the media loves Laverne Cox because Laverne Cox has had surgeries and looks a lot like a woman. So I dunno who live around the middle of that. The guy from, uh, well the, the transgender woman from orange is the new black. I never watched that show. I've never watched that show either, but she's on the cover of Time magazine. Oh. Or He's on the cover of Time magazine.

Speaker 1:          08:39          Well, there was the woman in that show. Isn't that the one where the girl who ruby row is that the girl? Yeah, that's Laverne Cox. That's a woman or man, that's man. I used to be a man. It used to be a man and a woman. Now. Very tricky. You know, it's still a man, but transgender tipping point. How far I'm so out of the loop. I'm old man. I'm that old man. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          08:56          well that was one thing. That headline there, right? It says America's next civil rights front here, and that's the key. You have a bunch of people in the United States who are suggesting that they want the next civil rights fight. Always the next civil rights fight. Right. So is it the sixth the civil rights fight, his immigration or the civil rights fight as gay marriage or the civil rights fight is transgenders. Okay. How about this? How about, there was only one real civil rights fight news about black people who had been historically oppressed in the United States for 200 year there had been slaves who had been slaves genders. This is correct. Okay. The worst that Caitlyn Jenner had experienced was being incredibly wealthy in a, in a high net worth suburb. This is not to say that transgender people don't, you know, aren't discriminated against in some, in some areas of American life. I'm sure that's true, but it's also like behavior is not the same as being born black or being born Asian or being born with, you know, uh, disabled. If, if I'm a business owner and I hire you and you're a man and you come in the next day and you're dressed in, in a woman's clothing saying you're a woman, but you still have a full beard. Like I don't see why I, as a business owner, I'm expected to eat the cost of that, like that just did that. It seems, that seems bizarre to me.

Speaker 1:          10:01          Eat the cost is a great way to phrase it. I didn't have a dog in this fight. I didn't, I, I was completely open and liberal about it until there was a case where a man who had been a man for 30 years became a woman for a little less than two years and then started MMA fighting women. Yes. Beating the fuck out of these women and shot and not proclaiming that he or she used to be a man because what is it in quotes, it was a medical condition that I did not need to disclose. Like that's not, I'm fucking medical conditions. Right. And if you ever watch the fights when Alan Fox, she wasn't winning because she was skillful. She was fucking manhandling these women. It was ugly horse. It was horrible.

Speaker 2:          10:45          It's like this is it. But again, it's, it's so funny how the transgender movement destroys the feminist movement by living off of the, the sort of lies that the feminist movement problem and get it to the feminist movement said stupid things like women and men equally athletic profession. Well that's

Speaker 1:          11:00          peated very recently that there's no biological difference in the genders and it's all social

Speaker 2:          11:05          absolute horse shit. I mean, I'm told, sorry. There is no scientific evidence to back that. And it's particularly true with regard to actual physical capacity. This is just nonsense. They just no scientific evidence, but I'm not, yeah. Yeah. I mean mountain of it. My favorite study on this as you know, there was, you remember there's that, those commercials about like throwing like a girl running like a girl, right? Remember there's the feminist commercial saying what does it to be running like girl, no to an adult woman and she'd be running all girly and then they would show little girl and she's running and it's still a little girly but she's running, you know like normally it's only exactly fierce. It's, it's only society that has forced the little girl to run. Like when it, first of all, I have a three year old girl, she runs like a girl second of all.

Speaker 2:          11:42          And it's not because I'm teaching her is that cause her mom runs cause she doesn't write but she played with dolls because you're a sexist pig. It's because of that. My, my daughters started off liking trucks like in the first year and I can give a shit and then and now likes playing with dolls and dressing up in princess dresses. Like who cares, she's a girl, she's always been a girl. She will always be a girl. Whether she likes trucks or whether she likes you guys. That was an issue with one of my daughters too. My daughter was a little worried about her. I go, she's going to be a dyke. She was like, no, like, what's the big deal? You like lesbians, who cares? I don't care. I'm like, I do not care. And she's like, and then she turned the corner and then she got, but we just let her be whatever she's in.

Speaker 2:          12:13          But she was really into like Batman for awhile. My daughter is in ABAP and then she was in a wonder woman. Like, who cares? Man Is it? But what's funny about this is that the left kept saying, even when I met my wife, right, who's, who's a conservative, and I made her more conservative when we got married, because that's what men tend to do to their lives. But she, but she, uh, you know, we, I remember early on we had a conversation about this and I said, women don't throw it like men. And she got like all offended. And I said, but that's factually attrition. Right? But it's, but it's insulting. It's like, no, that's factually true. Like I'm sorry, like there've been studies out of a thousand if you took a woman throwing a baseball and then a thousand men throwing a baseball, the woman will throw faster.

Speaker 2:          12:52          Then out of those thousand men is in the book, the sports gene, the one we'll throw faster than two of those men out of a thousand and we're not talking about like goose Gossage here. We're talking about, we're talking about the accountant from down the block. We're talking about Paul Ryan flinging a baseball, right? I mean that, that's not the way this stuff works. That was the counter that found Fox used was that she actually lost to a woman. She lost a woman named Ashley Evan Smith. But what I said was, no, this proves my point is that you're not good. You're just a man. Well, this was John Mcenroe got slapped all over the lot when he said about Serena Williams. She's great. Is there anyone who great and all, but if Serena Williams were competing, he said she's the best female player ever. And they were like, well, why not just the best player ever?

Speaker 2:          13:31          And he said, because she's a, she's a woman. Like if you were a man, she'd get her ass kicked. And everyone was like, no, how dare you. There is something called the universal tennis ranking. She would rank in the mid ranks of college male players. If you were a man and Serena Williams, he said like five years ago now, I never want to play with like Andy Roddick. He'd kill me. She, she actually did this. There was a 200th rank man in the world who she, she wanted to just warm up with and they played it like just a normal match for a, he won six one six nothing right. And he was, and he was like ranked 200th in the world. And the only shock was that he dropped, he dropped a point to her. Well, there was the issue of Renee Richards, when Renee Richards started playing tennis against women and kicking their ass and he was a middling player, best as a woman or as a man rather.

Speaker 2:          14:12          But as a woman, he was a fucking killer. I mean, Hey, I mean this is what, you didn't sell feminist. It turns out the Caitlyn Jenner, when all these hero of the year awards and everything we met are so great that even when we decided to be women were better than women but a woman for six months. But he's amazing. He's incredible at it. He's just, he was a natural men better even at being women than women. No wonder feminists are pissed and they should be. And this whole glossing over the, the, the difference between feminists who have been claiming that women are distinct from men and important and different and better in certain ways. Like I don't understand how you hold these two simultaneous thought. Hillary Clinton needs to be president because we need a female president, but also Donald Trump. If he said he was a woman, tomorrow would be a woman. How do you hold those two simultaneous thought? I always thought that in the last week of the election of Trump thought he was gonna lose. He should have just declared himself a woman and then he too could have run in the first female president. I would have been incredible trolling if he just showed up on the dresser and the entire left a woman. I'm the best looking woman ever. I've been, I've been voted as the best looking woman of all time. Um, money's great arguments that I've got it on.

Speaker 1:          15:15          Mine wasn't even arguments, we'll put it so many people were calling me a bigot because of this Fallon Fox thing. It was, it was stunning because it was so confusing to me. I'm like, I'm talking about defending a biological woman like you. These biological women, at least two of them, got the fuck beaten out of him by Fallon Fox before they found out that she used to be a man. I'm like, that's not an issue to these people. And so this one woman said, she's always been a woman. And I said, okay. She gave birth, she impregnated a woman and got her pregnant. I go, what about then she goes, even then he didn't. Then she was a woman. She was a woman. She went and she was fucking a woman with her deck and getting that woman pregnant like we are in fantasy land. It's crazy town town, but this doesn't mean this is what's crazy.

Speaker 1:          16:01          Like you can't just because something's a logical, you can't just decide that someone's a bigot. Like you're you. You were in a weird area. We're talking about bone structure and here's the crazy muscle density there. There. There's the crazy thing is that they always rely on these gender reassignment doctors to define the terms. And it's really interesting because I got deep, deep, deep into the rabbit hole with this cause. I was really shocked at how many people were angry at me and there was one doctor who was a board certified endocrinologist who sort of broke it down. She's like, not only is the science behind this crazy, but when you have gender reassignment surgery, one of the big issues with men, I'm transitioning into women, his bone density, who she's like, when you have gender reassignment surgery, you're taking estrogen, which actually preserves bone density. She's like, not only do they have less bone density once they become a woman, they might have more will because you're preserving it like it's, you're not going to automatically be just like a woman in a year or so.

Speaker 2:          16:59          I don't think surgeons, I mean I know too much about doctoring from having spent 1000 years with my wife's medical education to believe that doctors have the capacity to magically change man into a woman. I didn't know maybe it's going to happen one day with like CRISPR or something like that when they start using genetic, I mean really genetic tendencies. Maybe Andy actually at the chromosome this before birth, but no, I mean like no. Once, once your, once your genes had been defined. What's your chromosomes? Symptoms like this is fifth grade science people. It's fifth grade science. What scares the shit out of me is when you hear these stories about people deciding that their child who's like eight or nine days left up beyond belief.

Speaker 1:          17:36          Gary, because you can't have nine year look, a fucking 17 year old doesn't know. That was the thing about the ruby rose girl. She was saying that when she was young, when she was a teenager, she wanted to be a man. She wanted to be transgender, and that she had gone through that phase and now she's so that she didn't do anything

Speaker 2:          17:50          right. Well, they did. They say that 80% of kids who experience any sort of gender dysphoria as children grow out of it. So when you have a society that reinforces it, and then in Canada, they're now having the passing laws. Now, let's say that if a kid says, you know, you have a girl and the girl says, I'm a boy and she's three, that the government can come into your house and take the kid. Because obviously if, if you, if you don't want to humor of the kid and get the kid treatment or surgery or, or hormone blockers, then you're obviously doing something wrong to the kid. This is just, it's insane. First of all, if anyone tried to do that with my kid, I would meet them at the door with a gun. I mean that, that, that this is, this is the kind of stuff where you're talking legit civil war. Like when, when you say that the government can take people's kids from them because the government knows better than you how to parent your kids on basic things like are you a boy or a girl that's going to get violent pretty quickly? If you send someone in my door with a gun saying I'm taking your daughter from you because your daughter says she's a boy at school and you, and you're not going to take her to a psychiatrist to start her transitioning process. Oh no,

Speaker 1:          18:46          but what, how did we get so far down this rabbit hole of insanity? And this is again, this is not taking away the personal choice of a 60 year old man like Bruce Jenner who decides he wants to be a woman. You want free country go have at it, have a good time. But how did we get so crazy that that becomes an option that people aren't, they're not paying attention to the, the massive variables that a child encounters, psychological variable stress variables. What's going on in the home, what's happening hormonally, what's happening psychologically, what is happening to you and how, how can you decide like, this is it, you're going to, you're going to allow this kid to make a, like a locked down decision to begin gender transition surgery at like nine or 10 years old hormone blockers in there to an eight year old. Yeah. And you know, and then they'll show you like this girl who's like 13 who used to be a boy and you know, you see her act and talk and they go, how could you imagine that this isn't a girl? Okay. I don't, you know, I don't know. I don't, I don't, I don't, I just don't know what happened.

Speaker 2:          19:52          I'm going to go with the fact that there's a y chromosomes in every cell of that person's body, except ironically for some of his sperm cells to tell me that that's probably a boy. And, and yes, you can block the manifestation of some physical characteristics that does not change the chromosomes. And there are legitimately Intersex people, right? I mean, there are people who legitimately have conditions like Kleinfelter syndrome. I mean they're, they're like, these are, these are actual biological things, but if you're telling me any boy can be a girl, no, no. The answer is no. And it's, that's not biologically correct. And you're not doing any sort of service to a child, especially with evidence less. I mean, you, no, you're doing no service to a child by bringing bye, bye. Humoring what is obviously a mental condition. And in mental condition, by the way, again, linkedin 40% lifetime suicide rate is higher than any other population on planet earth by a whopping margin. I mean, telling kids that we are going to force you into the, like you express when you're five that you think you're the sex and now at eight we're going to transition you into this and your suicide rate is exactly the same as somebody who didn't do that, right. Where it's very similar to someone who didn't do that and, and like, this is somehow supposed to benefit the person. Uh, it's just, it's, it's beyond imagination and I think it's cruelty. What's very strange for sure. And as someone who doesn't experience gender dysphoria,

Speaker 1:          21:07          I liked it. I mean when, when someone's got some sort of an issue, whatever it is, whether you call it, call it an issue or a condition or whatever the fuck it is and I don't have it. I try to be as, as standoffish. I tried to be as objective. I tried to be as as kind as possible. This is a weird one though. This is a weird one because it's, it's become some sort of a fad and any criticism of it whatsoever, even discussion of it, you are labeled as a, as a transphobic piece of shit. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          21:35          I think it's only weird honestly because it's run into the weird sexual politics that dominates in the country because if we were to talk about Anorexia, which is a form of body dysphoria. Yes. All right. Or if we were to talk about, I mean there are actual is something body identity, integrity disorder, right? Where people like want to lose an arm. I we we'd be saying, well the problem is in your brain, it's not in your arm. Like chopping off your arms seems a little extreme. But if you want to do that, like go ahead. But if you were a kid and it's a five year old, wouldn't say, oh, well this kid's going to suffer with this their entire life. Like let's just chop off their arm now. Prevent them, their arm from developing like this is not [inaudible]. And to tell the entire society that this is a positive good is a whole nother thing.

Speaker 2:          22:11          It's one thing to try and treat people who have a disorder humanely. It's another thing to redefine the terms of the entire civilization as well as biology in order to fit that. That's, this is, it's valuing the subject over the objective. Science is objective. Your feelings about who you are is subjective. You can have those feelings, but once you are trying to translate those feelings into the objective standard, we all must told by now you're encroaching on my territory. It's not just, it's not just you doing what you want to do anymore. You're, you're telling me what I have to do. And that's a different thing, right?

Speaker 1:          22:38          Well, no one people say that there's this 40% suicide rate amongst transgender people. Um, one of the arguments that I've heard is it's because they're not accepted. Right? I've heard this too. Yeah. Yeah. And that if they were accepted and then they felt themselves and they felt loved for their true self, then it would be just like everybody else.

Speaker 2:          22:56          And I've seen no evidence to suggest that if, if there's, if there is a decrease based on treatment, then it's marginal at best. But that

Speaker 1:          23:05          it's, is it uniform? Like I would like to know is like gender dysphoria, is it in a similar percentile as a anorexia or what bodybuilders get, or what's strippers get when they get triple f tits?

Speaker 2:          23:19          I know there's a lot to look up. Like the anorexic suicide, right. Um, does for you is a weird thing. You know, it's, it's, it is that people, there's a girl that goes to my yoga class that's anorexic and it's so disturbing. It's so sad. Oh, it's, it's, it's horrifying. It's horrifying. And listen, I'm not telling, I'm not saying that we should mistreat people, but if again, you're talking about an entire society mean forced to redefine basic biological terminology, then like it be an adult, like live, like live with this. I'm, I'm happy to treat you with, uh, listen what? I would hire a transgender person, but I'm not going to see, I'm not going to change what reality is in order to humor you. Like if you call yourself Napoleon, I'm not going to call you Napoleon Napoleon. I'm like, this is not something I'm up for it.

Speaker 1:          24:04          What'd you take it into consideration? No, I mean when you're looking at the still like it was, what if someone was really good at their job and someone else was equally good at their job but not transgender? Would you lean towards the not transgender person? Cause you say, well the transgender person, they're dealing with a host of psychological issues, obviously.

Speaker 2:          24:19          Well, I mean I, I think that you would have to think about, you know, typical aspects of reliability. Just the same way you would with any other mental disorder if you need somebody was was manic depressive, which is super common and you have somebody who is equally qualified. He's not manic depressive. You might think, well that might have an effect on on how they do their job. Yeah. So maybe, I mean I, you know, I've, I haven't had enough personal experience with transgender people to know whether it would impact a secretarial job or something. Probably not. Yeah, probably not. But it's, but again, to pretend that like transgenders in the military, this seems to me like in a decision that will be made my military people who actually have to determine how much does this impact the job. And if you already have a group of people with a 40% suicide rate who have high levels of higher levels of instabilities, a group not individually as a group, and you're choosing which groups to pick from to be on the front lines in small units living under severe pressure for months at a time. Yeah. Like, is that something that, is that what you're going to go for or is that something where like you, you'd have to overcome certain presumptions in order to get there? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          25:20          Tweeted something that Kristin Beck wrote the other day. Um, uh, but when the military band, when Trump, apparently there was not a real

Speaker 2:          25:28          no, it's bullshit. I mean base from just trying to distract from the sessions thing. Is that what it is? Yeah. Yeah. I get t two minutes later he's back to tweeting about sessions here. This was the part about that I didn't like, like I actually agree that there is a question as to whether the military should be recruiting transgender people because I think that the military has certain, like it creates a bunch of questions, not just questions about who showers with whom, but also questions like, okay, you have a transgender man. Does he have to fill the female standards of fitness or the male standards, the standards of fitness or like these are actual questions. Does it, how does it work with troop cohesion? Right? You have a group of men and now you have a man who's technically a man, but he's, did you treat him as a woman?

Speaker 2:          26:02          Like does you have to carry the same amount of stuff? Is the guy like how does that work exactly right. It does this, the cost of gender transition surgery and hormones and psychologists like does that come into play at all here? Would you recruit from the anorexic community for the military? Like that's it. These are like real questions. But that said, that's why they commissioned a study from General Maddis at Department of Defense. He was going to look into all of this and then give a report in six months and Trump just sort of tweeted it out there. I agree that, I think that Trump's general, you know, his general attitude on it is probably correct in terms of what the military is. They're doing, what, what it's not there to do. But what I don't agree with is how he did it at all because it's disrespectful to the people in the military who are transgender.

Speaker 2:          26:40          I mean like I wouldn't want to find out in a tweet. I want a better rationale. Van Two tweets and then we're back to, and then we're back to, you know, like look, they're doing more than, I mean they're serving in the military. I didn't serve in the military. It seems like it would be pretty hypocritical of me to say, well, it's perfectly respectful to say in two tweets you're out because that's the way it is without any sort of supporting argumentation. And he didn't actually implement a policy. He didn't give the policy to the Defense Department so they could even implement it. The Pentagon says they're not implementing it because they don't have a policy. So as a PR thing, so this a weird PR thing, but it really stirred up people in the, which was, I think it was designed to do. Right. I'm sure.

Speaker 2:          27:16          Either that or he just felt like tweeting. And I think that's what I, I think that's what it was. I mean he wanted to shift the conversation and it was the funniest thing about that is that he did it in two tweets. In the first half of the tweet was in consultation with my generals and my military experts. We have decided that we will no longer accept Eclipsys 10 minute gap transgender people in the military. So there was a, there was a, there was a story, a buzzfeed, those kind of funny, they went an interviewed a bunch of people in the Pentagon and a bunch of the people in the Pentagon or like during that 10 minute cap, I didn't know whether we were going to nuclear war, what right. Cause that first tweet we will no longer extended. Could've been North Korea Korea's missile missile test programs.

Speaker 2:          27:53          So wow. Yeah. This again is evidence. I think it's an example of even if I think the policy is good, good policy done, the wrong way is actually counterproductive for the policies that I want to see. None like I want it laid out by Madison. I want to lay it out by defense department. I want all the reasons laid out so we can have a good discussion over it. I don't really want just like thought vomit on Twitter, that's just not, I don't think it's effective. Well it also seems that this issue is such a hot issue and it's also an issue that you're not really allowed to have an opinion on other than the standard opinion. This has always and trapped in a man's body and this is the way it is. And by the way, healthy this day cardian notion that it's like a man, it's like the, the the sole in the machine and there was a woman deep down for 40 years who had three children with a man's penis and now is now is escaping.

Speaker 2:          28:43          There's like Ghostbusters, like uh, again goes faster. It just, have you seen the man in England? Was it in England knows Germany, the man that identifies as a six year old girl? Yes. And so they turned them into a six year old girl and there's this clip, that clip of me that's going around the Internet a fair bit when I'm talking to a college girl about this. And she, she's sang like men or men can be women and women can be men. And I said, well, how old are you? I love that clip. And they, come on, why aren't you 16 she's six days. And she, she's like baffled, like what? And then it finally hits her and it's like, well, you know, yeah. It's, I think this is what's kind of frightening about the age we live in, is that we can't even come up with common definitions of basic things. How are we supposed to have conversations with each other? If you can't decide what a man is or what a woman is, or whether a scientific fact ought to be relevant or not, at least we could decide what was the scientific factor, not before. And now. It's like the subjective has just eaten everything. If I don't think it's a scientific fact, it's no longer a scientific fact and they're I no longer parameters

Speaker 1:          29:42          of the argument. It's become about freedom. The freedom to be your authentic self versus biology. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          29:47          Right. And again, be be be your authentic self. I don't give a shit. They will do whatever you want, like you know, more power to you. But it is no longer about your freedom to be our authentic self when you're talking about either a legislation that impacts how I run my business or how I raise my child or your suggesting that it is my duty to humor your authentic self. Like I think there are a lot of people who do stupid crap their entire lives. It's not my job to humor their authentic self. I mean I'm, I'm pro drug legalization but I've never done drugs and I think the drugs are stupid, you know, don't tell me that I have to like cheer when somebody smokes a joint. Like do what you want but don't tell me that. I have to redefine what I think is good and bad behavior. That's silly.

Speaker 1:          30:23          Yeah. It doesn't make any sense. And the other thing that it became this weird political hot point where we're talking about bathrooms. Yeah. And then it become like the number one was easy for people to sort of boil down the argument into that. Right. Of course. Like this. What about my children? My children would go to the bathroom and a man with a dress is going to come in and he's gonna claim that he's a identifying as a woman. And it got to the point where so many people were upset about it that people were boycotting South Carolina.

Speaker 2:          30:50          Oh yeah. You know the, and, and this, the one I thought was amazing was, was the NCAA saying they were going to remove the final four from North Carolina because they passed the, the bathroom bill right in North Carolina. And I asked online, okay, so when are you going to abolish the separate male and female divisions of the NCAA? My got me. You've said that we can't have separate male and female bathrooms were biological males play. And you know, biological males go to one bathroom and biological females go to another. So why do you have separate divisions? Why do you have a, why do you have an NCAA women's division and an NCAA men's division? Yeah. Where does this go? I mean eventually it boiled down. I mean eventually it goes to one place or another. Like either we just say this is a step too far. It gives me a break, you know, science has no, or we say anyone can be anything at any time. A man as a woman and a woman as a man and you know, it's in just pick.

Speaker 1:          31:38          Have you ever seen any of the videos for people that are gender fluid? I have seen those videos. Those videos are fascinating. Like you said, wake up one day and there are a woman and the next day there are man. And there was a guy on NPR, on um, radio lab on the podcast who transitions at times of stress makes perfect sense to me in the middle of having a conversation. I just switched. I'm Paul now. I'm a man

Speaker 2:          32:02          when he's more stressed as he switched into a woman because that'd be really sexist, right? I mean, I think they like it. If he was stressed at work and he switched into a woman and started crying, that seems kind of sexist to me. That's implying that women are the people who cry at work. So that is sex also. This raises a bunch of other weird questions like, okay, if you're like, there's, there's been this, again, you wanna talk about weird, there's been this, this, this weird push in parts of the Trans Community to suggest that a male who doesn't want to have sex with a biological male who says he's a female, is a, is now a sexist against women. Phobe is it trans folk? Right? You're a bad person if you're a man who doesn't want to have sex with a man, a biological man, and it doesn't make you gay to do that, right?

Speaker 2:          32:38          If you have sex with a biological man who says he's a woman, that's straight sex, but if you were to have sex as a biological woman who says she's a man, you're gay. Yeah. Kind of weird. Really Weird. But I have seen the arguments and the blog posts and the tweets about men who discriminate against trans women who do not want to date trans women. And people keep saying, well, it's, it's culturally define. It's like, no, that's called evolution. What you might have a baby together. Correct. Correct. It turns out that evolution wants men to have sex with women. Like, I'm sorry to break it to everybody, but evolution rose relies on human reproduction. Okay. If you put that thing in the wrong place, it ain't going to reproduce. Like that's just, sorry. I mean I don't know. I don't know why I have to keep apologizing for science and, and then they say that my party is the party of non science.

Speaker 2:          33:24          Like what? Like you're the ones who say that two minutes before my baby is born, it's not a baby and a man can be a woman. But I'm anti-science. I'm just, I'm, I'm wildly confused by this. Well, the whole thing is wildly confusing. Um, but it's just, it's such a strange subject. It's such a strange subject that's been brought to the forefront and I think it's about more of the moral posturing than it is about people who actually think this is a major issue. I think you're absolutely right. And I think people love to be virtuous. They'll have to be on that side. They live to virtue signal. How dare you, I dare you. We're doing it. It's the how dare you with Dicks or lack of fake dicks, but they don't really have a lot of fake dicks. They don't really go that far.

Speaker 2:          34:01          They just sort of take testosterone and see what's up. But the, the, it's just, it's a weird facet of our society today that is a unexpected, I mean, you go back 2030 years and it was an oddity and you know, even during the Renee Richards thing, it was, it was more of an oddity than anything. And think just sort of accepted. This is why I say I think that it's, I think that a lot of people who are virtue signaling are still treating it as an oddity. They just won't admit that. Right. I think that they're watching it because it's a circus to them. And I think that's actually cool. I don't think that you should like put people who suffer from mental illness on the cover of magazines. I just don't, I think that that's bad strategy.

Speaker 3:          34:41          [inaudible].
