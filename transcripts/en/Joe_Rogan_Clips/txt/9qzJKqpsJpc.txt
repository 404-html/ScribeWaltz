Speaker 1:          00:00          I understand the mindset of people that don't want any of this to happen. I do understand it, but I do think that they don't understand nature. I really don't think they understand that this is the best death these animals will ever experience and they're not going to live forever. And the wild and the wild, they're going to be torn apart by something bigger than that. That's just how it goes 100% of the time. Or they freeze to death or they starve to death or they're starving. They walked down on the road to try to find some food in the town. They get hit by a semi truck. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. And if I have a buddy who lives in Iowa and when you drive in his neighborhood at night, you better go 35 miles an hour cause those fuckers are just darting out in front of this tree weapon. Right. They're everywhere. And you know what's the, what's the solution? Don't drive cars. Drive your bike everywhere man. Well, okay, good luck with that. Yeah, I get it. I get where those people are coming from. They're coming from a place of, of compassion, but it becomes very culty and it becomes very like very team oriented, their team Vegan

Speaker 2:          00:57          and there's like words it we're circling back where you know, when you're trying to have that middle ground, that discussion, that conversation. Um, there's like this pre assigned talking points where everybody from every respect of side mix essentially the same argument and you're just regurgitating what you've heard other people say, but there's no new thought. There's new and there's no one taking a step to either side. Like, okay, do you want maybe, maybe there's something I'm not seeing here. Let me look at it from this perspective. Or vice versa. Where this side, the hunters like, no, no, you're stupid snow flake. You know, go get your Starbucks Latte, you know, with your soy milk. And, but they're never looking at it from anything new right there. They're just regurgitating their talking points. Like when you said gun control and people freaked out, freaked out because I didn't stay to the script and there's a script.

Speaker 2:          01:49          I mean, if you pull up my, any of my social, you will see that, oh, you what you should've said was, or hey, you know, shall not be infringed upon. Yeah man, I got it. Yeah. Shall not be infringed upon and believe it to death. Have you fought for it? Have you bled for it had been blown up for it. You've been shot at, I have, you know, I really believe in this shit, but I didn't stay to the script and then I get murdered by both sides. So then how do we, I mean, you do a pretty good job, so teach me Joe, how do you bring people in to have,

Speaker 1:          02:22          there's gotta be a lot of people that disagree with you and say, I do a terrible job that I repeat the same things over and over again. And I agree with them to for for a certain amount of the conversations like this one. I mean we, I've had this conversation about conservation and animals a hundred times, but I think it's worth having a hundred more because I think it's an important that if someone has listened to this podcast and they didn't understand how it all works and they didn't understand that people who hunt and eat meat, they're not monsters. They're not evil people. Just like people who eat grain aren't monsters because you callously disregard the lives of mice and rats, all the things that get ground up and combines and bunnies. Like if you buy grain, large scale agriculture is bad, period. It's bad in terms of factory farming, but it's also bad in terms of growing food. If you grow a thousand acres of corn, you are absolutely displacing wildlife. And when that stuff gets harvest, you see vultures fly over those fields and there's a reason it's because there's a bunch of dead things. In fact, more dead lives, more dead lives occur in a pound of grain then occur in a pound of beef. Because if you think that a cow is more valuable than a bunny because it's larger, like you've got some weird white thing going on in your own head.

Speaker 2:          03:42          Okay. Can you tell me how to balance the soul's worth?

Speaker 1:          03:45          Exactly. And how would you feel about insects? Because they are a large scale poisoning those fucking insects and you know it, everybody knows it and they're grinding those fuckers up with earthworms and mice and gophers and chipmunks and anything else that gets stuck in those wheels. That is just how large scale agriculture works. So unless you have some isolated farm where everything's fenced in and you only have a certain amount of acreage and that farm feeds you will, you are Karma free and congratulations to you, you figured out how to do it. But most of us who buy pasta, if you go and buy bread in the store, you're, you're paying someone who's killed a large amount of living things in order to harvest that grain. That's just a fact. It's just a fact. And it's an inconvenient fact that they like to look at, uh, with blinders on because they, you know, like I'm hashtag cruelty free not to that fucking bunny rabbit that's a part of your tofu cause this is, this is what's really going on. I mean, a good part of the B vitamin B that a lot of vegans get us from ground up bugs that's ground up into their grain and ground up into their vegetables. I mean, this is you, this is just, you can't get away around that.

Speaker 2:          04:58          No, I mean not if you are being real, if you're not, if you're being real. Yeah. Maybe that's the problem in the first place is nobody is going to have the courage to come into that middle ground and let, let go of all of their baggage and all of their

Speaker 1:          05:17          bullshit. Yeah. And just cool with eating bugs. You should eat crickets, get cricket meal, eat cricket, protein. Fucking good for you. Yeah. If you don't want to eat animals, you're like, I'm just not into anything that's warm. Okay. I have a friend who only eats fish and I go, why? He goes, fish. Don't even take care of their babies. I was like, Ooh, good point. That is a good point. Fuck those fish Fisher. Yummy too. He's like, I don't want to kill a mammal. He goes, I don't want to eat a mammo. He's like, mammals take care of their babies there. The baby's milk from their, their, you know, their utters. I'm like, okay, I get it.

Speaker 2:          05:47          My wife has a pescatarian for awhile. Um, that didn't, that didn't last. It's just not the best source source of nutrients. Well, it was when she's pregnant and the doctor's like, all right, so you're 90 pounds and, uh, I need you to put on like 20 more pounds really fast and you're not going to do it eating halibut. Yeah. So, yeah.
