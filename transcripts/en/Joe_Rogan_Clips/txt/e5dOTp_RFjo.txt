Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00          I certainly really surprised me learning about the history of all this stuff. At the birth of the drug war, it was intensely resisted, right? I think about here in La, right? In Los Angeles, there was a doctor called Henry Smith Williams. When heroin was band, there was a deliberate loophole in the law that said, okay, you can't sell her him, but doctors can prescribe it to people with addiction problems. Just like what happened in Switzerland, right? So here in La, big heroin clinic prescribed Anslinger. It drives him crazy. He wants to shut it down. So the mayor of Los Angeles stands in front of this heroin prescription clinic and says, you will not shut this down. This does a good job for us. But Anslinger shuts it down. When the doctors say to the, there's the biggest crackdown on doctors in American history, over 12,000 doctors are arrested and rounded up.

Speaker 2:          00:44          Um, when they come to the one in Portland, Oregon, the doctors say, but what are we meant to do with all these vulnerable, addictive people? And one of the agents that go and throw them in the lake, they'll make good fish food, right? That was the attitude. Um, so this is resisted intensely at the birth of the drug war. So you had a society really recently that had a much more mature, exactly what you're asking about a much more mature attitude to drug use than we have now, right? It's not that people thought all drug use is good. We should celebrate every instance of drug use. No one thinks that. Right? There were problems and there were, there is some joy associated with drug use. That's actually the norm. There is some pain and terrible things associated with drug use, which are mostly driven by underlying harm. But there are real harms that come from some drugs as well. Um, and most societies until very recently had a mature appreciation of this. Right? Really, we are the outlier that most societies have had licensed intoxicants. Um, now of course in different societies at different times it was, I was the czar of Russia who wanted to ban tobacco. Right. And did terrible things to anyone who was found with tobacco. Different societies have had different panics at different times,

Speaker 1:          01:52          but

Speaker 2:          01:55          we are the historical outliers, right? I mean, to give you a sense of just the United States in prisons, 2 million people, that has never been a society that imprisons this many of its citizens, this higher proportion of its citizens anywhere ever. It's overwhelmingly driven by the drug war, right? I mean, the u s in prison, so many people and the conditions in those prisons are so terrible that the United States is almost certainly the first society ever were more men have been raped. The women pass how extreme this, this war is, right? And what we do to people in it, what this, what this, the, the, the conditions this war creates it's, um, and he's a total historical outlier. We are in a freak experiment, right? And the one thing you can say in defense of the drug war, and I would give one bit of credit for this, is we gave it a fair shot, right? The United States has done it for a hundred years. Uh, this country has spent $1 trillion on it. Uh, we've imprisoned millions of our own citizens. We've, because we killed hundreds of thousands of people that are conservative estimate. We've destroyed whole countries. Like Colombia

Speaker 3:          03:02          isn't the problem now that there's a gigantic business behind it all from private prisons to prison guard unions to the pharmaceutical industry that would benefit from keeping most of these drugs illegal. So their profits continue to rise to law enforcement. I mean, down the line it's, you'd be disrupting like an evil industry, but an industry, I think that's a real factor, but I don't want to overstate it. Lots of policies have best in the factor. What's the main factor?

Speaker 2:          03:30          The main factor is most people asked, do you think the drug war has failed? So yes. And most people ask, do you want to legalize any drug other than cannabis? Say No. Very strong. So education, I think it's about, I won't use the word education can give you an example of a [inaudible] person who I think showed away to do this. Um, so in the year 2000 in Vancouver, there was a homeless street addict called bottles, boom. And, and he lived in a notorious part of Vancouver called the downtown east side. It, um, people in Vancouver had been to one knew it. No, it's a place particular at that time that had, um, really high like nightmarish open drug scene, Rogers again, people need like in Switzerland, people injecting in the streets, that kind of thing. And Bob w was living homeless and he was watching his friends die all around him at that time.

Speaker 2:          04:18          Um, there was a really big police crackdown. Um, and so people would go and like hide and dumpsters or in alleyways to shoot up. But obviously if you're hiding and you overdose, no one sees it, you just die. Right. And one day bud, um, Hitler's at one of his friends, Judith had had died and he's like, I can't just sit here and wait for my friends to die and then for me to die. But as bud would have put it, then he also thought, I'm a homeless junkie. What the fuck am I going to do? Right. But had a really simple idea. He gathered together a group of the other homeless street addicts and he said, um, when we're not using, which is most of the time, even people on the streets, what we should do is just drop a timetable and go and look in the places where we know people, where we she up.

Speaker 2:          05:02          Right. And if we see someone overdosing will bring an ambulance. Now officials, nothing like that. Just us and loads of people had descended on the downtown east side to come up with problems to solve everything. And people were very skeptical but they liked bud. Ah, okay, we'll do it. So they start going and searching and um, over the next three months, the downtown that the death toll on the downtown east side like had a significant fall. And obviously that meant people who would have died were living, which is a great thing. But it also meant the addicts thought, oh, maybe we're not the pieces of shit. Everyone says we are right. Maybe we can do something. Then we're like, what else can we do? Bud went to the library. He learned in Frankfurt. In Germany, they had open safe injection rooms, but like what happened in California until they shut it down, Anslinger shut it down where people could go and use their drugs and be watched by doctors and nurses and that this had massively reduced deaths in Frankfurt.

Speaker 2:          05:49          Nothing like this had happened in the United States since Anslinger shut it all down, but bird's like, okay, we'll persuade our map. They set up a group called Van, do the Vancouver Area Network of drug users. Okay. The Mare was a conservative right wing guy called Phillip Iom who would be an American comparison. It's not Trump like Mitt Romney, rich guy from privileged family didn't get, didn't know anything about addicts. He'd, he'd run for office saying all the local drug addicts should be located to be taken and detained to the local military base in Chilliwack and never let out if she sends to where he's coming from. Right. People are not optimistic about persuading him. Van Do bud, his friends, they decide everywhere Philipo and goes, they're going to follow him with a coffin and the coffin had written on it. He will die next Philipo in before you open a safe injection site.

Speaker 2:          06:40          Every time Phillip own spoken public, one of the homeless people with addiction problems with stand up and say he will die next power him before you open a safe injection site. Um, one day Dean Wilson, one of the main people in Vandy stood up and said, do you remember Julia who asked you recently? He would die next. It turned out to be hurt because you haven't done it right. This goes on for a long time. They do loads of public actions. They filled Oppenheimer Park, which big park in Vancouver with a cross more than a thousand crosses each one representing someone who had died of an overdose and they wrote the names of the people on the crosses and one day after it's been going on for years, it totally tastes credit. Philipo Ian just said, who the fuck are these people? What is this? And he went to meet loads of the addicts.

Speaker 2:          07:24          He sat with them. It blew his mind. He thought people with addiction problems, people who partied too hard indulge themselves. He was completely shocked. He came here, uh, to the Untied States to meet, uh, Milton Friedman, the Nobel prize winning economist who grown up under alcohol prohibition and Milton Friedman Explains Drug Prohibition to Phillip over it, but it probably comes back to Vancouver and he holds a press conference and had the chief of police, the coroner, and a representative of the addicts. And he says something like, I'm not going to speak again without having the addicts here with me about addiction because they understand it better than me. We're going to open the first safe injection site in North America. We're going to have the most compassionate drug policies in North America. Things are gonna change around here, right? The open, safe injection site, Philipo ins, right wing party is so horrified.

Speaker 2:          08:11          They de-select him as is, as the candidate and his whole political career ends. But a more liberal guy wins the election in the room, stays open in the 10 years that followed, overdose deaths on the downtown east side fell by 80% eight 0% right? Average life expectancy in that neighborhood rose by 10 years. You just don't get figures like that very often. And I remember the reason I say in relation to change, it's, you know, a big part of what I argue in chasing the scream anymore that, but lost connections is, you know, we, you don't write people off, right? But I realized I would have written off Philipo in right wing guy runs for saying we should lock them all up in the military base. Right? You don't write off anyone. You don't know who can be persuaded by message of love and compassion.

Speaker 2:          08:55          And the most unlikely, one of the biggest champions of my book is a conservative Evangelical Christian in Mississippi called Christina Dennis, who's doing incredible work with this, right? And I thought a lot about Filippone when I went to go and see Phillip Ahmed on the downtown east side, and he said to me, he would sacrifice his entire political career all over again given the chance for this course. He said, how often do you get to save thousands of lives at the most vulnerable people? And after I got to know Bud Osborne, the guy who started this movement, um, he died. He, he, uh, I remember, uh, you know, he's only in his early sixties, but he'd been a homeless addict during a drug war. It takes a toll on you and they sealed off the streets of the downtown east side where bought had lived as a homeless person and they had this incredible memorial ceremony and there were loads of people at that ceremony who knew that they were alive because of what buttered started.

Speaker 2:          09:45          And because so many other people have joined them and so many people who didn't have addiction problems had opened their hearts. Right. And I remember thinking that day, you know, when you get disheartened about, they said it's easy to get disheartened, right? This is a hundred year long drug war. Um, we're up against very powerful forces. Everyone watching your show, listening to your show is more powerful than bud was that day, right? The day he started that, right? It just, by virtue of the fact they have a device on which to listen to this, right, but didn't sit there thinking someone else is going to handle this. He didn't sit there thinking, oh well this is doubled up against these forces that can't be defeated. He started where he stood. He appealed to the people around him and it started this circle of change that, you know, the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that because the right wing government of Stephen Harper tried to shut down this injection site.

Speaker 2:          10:35          Um, and the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that people with addiction promise have a right to light, to live, and that includes a safe place. You said it looks like will never be taken away now, right? That static is one, but you know, when you have nothing else, you have a voice. You have a human voice that you can use to persuade other people with love and compassion. You can tell them stories. You can build people's love and compassion in the middle of this catastrophe that we're seeing in this country with the addiction crisis. Right? I mean, more people died last year and the opioid crisis than all the soldiers who died in the Vietnam war combined in the middle of this catastrophe. We can carry on doing what we've been doing. Okay. We can carry on doing that, then we will continue to get the horrific results we are now getting.

Speaker 2:          11:21          We can continue to copy the places that have failed, right? At the end of a hundred year long drug war, those cost $1 trillion. We can't even keep drugs out of our prisons where we have a wall perimeter and we pay people to walk around at the whole time. So good luck keeping them out of a 3000 mile border. Right? That will never happen. That is a ludicrous fantasy. He might as well take all the money that will be spent on trying to keep drugs out. That way I'm burning it in a pile. Right, is absurd. There's never been such a society. Um, all we can start to copy the places that have, right Portugal, Switzerland, Urgh why Canada? There are plenty of places that have tried the alternatives and people who were quite skeptical. It's one thing that was most striking to me in all those places is that people who were initially skeptical and initially thought it was crazy, very often change their minds. This is the consistent pattern before it happens. People think it's the work of bunch of fucking Wackos. They think, why people who want to, you know, get everyone to use drugs and get children to use drugs and think it's madness. And then they see that that's not at all what motivates people who want reform. And that's not, that's not what happens in practice when you, when you adopt these policies, and it's not a magic bullet and they still have problems, but there's been such a significant improvement in all those places.
