Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. It's just crazy to me that you got so deeply entrenched reading the story that you started getting into Santa Maria. I was actually until I was married to a Brazilian for 10 years. Ah. So they have their centers in the, he is called Macuna. And what's different about their version? It's almost exactly the same and they have all the same saints. It's the same thing. Same thing because of the slave trade came through Brazil, Africa, Catholicism mixing. They that just the music is different with the Cubans. It's a Roomba. All this wonderful room or music that you hear a, there's a whole bunch of great music that grows up around it. So you were married to a Brazilian woman, get divorced to keep the religion cause that what happened? Uh, yeah, I was, I can't go to places like Cuba and Brazil because I get so influenced and overwhelmed by the changes, the direction of my life. Really. I went to Brazil the first full day I was in Brazil. I fell in love with the woman that I married and lived with for the next 10 years. Wow. When I go to Q a it's dangerous to me because I'm so uh, seduced by it. I'm so intoxicated by Havana, by Cuban culture. What is it?

Speaker 1:          01:20          Well, first of all, it's the most sensual place you have an is the most sensual place I've ever been. Everyone flirts, the women flirt. Doesn't matter if they're married or not married, they flirt with you. I suppose guys flirt too. Um, everyone flirts, there's like sexual energy everywhere. The Sky and the, and the climate is just kind of sultry and, and, and sensual. The music is, makes your body move.

Speaker 2:          01:48          Joe, would you let me play a video for you to show you some of the dancing and Cuba? Sure. When women dancing Cuban, they cover that pussy because what I'm trying to do, the whole dance is me baiting you. It's one of the prettiest things you've ever seen in your life. It's me coming up to you with this movement. Like when I played it like you all, I was getting nowhere with DOL. I was getting going with us way before the podcast. He was tightening up so I had to play low Papinas. Then my town size, and once he heard that I could see Nigeria coming alive. He even got up and kicked his leg one time, which meant we're on because it's so embedded in your culture. But in Cuban dancing, I'm coming up to you. Oh. And every time I come up and I'll go like this and go like this. Yeah, you got to come and put your ass. But the whole time he'll be covering your pussy because I'm the exchange. I go to grab your pussy.

Speaker 1:          02:52          Harvey Weinstein would do phenomenal. Here's how serious I take it. By the way, what is this? Oh, I love, I love Afro Cuban music, Latin Jazz. So I'm hosting, I'm curating and hosting a Latin jazz series in New York at a bar called sync every Thursday night, Tj English and his Latin jazz explosion. So I get to choose the music, the musicians that performed there, and I and I host the evening. Wow, you do this every week. Yeah, we're going to cry. Try to just keep, keep it going indefinitely. That's phenomenal. So this to you was a natural subject to sort of ink engross yourself? Well, I had written, I had published the book, Havana Nocturne, which was about the mob in Cuba in the 50s. Um, and I really got into it. Then I made numerous trips to Havana for extended periods. So this book was almost like a sequel to that.

Speaker 1:          03:45          Yeah. It was a nice way to revisit that culture. Pick up the thread of that story. Uh, cause this one is sort of an answer. You get to the end of the event, uh, Havana Nocturne. Then you, you ask yourself, so then what happened? What happened after the mafia got chased out of Cuba? What was their response? How did they take it? I want to show you this as a Cuban dancing. Okay. What does it say? What's the name of the, well, I call this a little bit, watch to see how everything is. Look, look at this.

Speaker 3:          04:17          Uh,

Speaker 1:          04:20          yeah. It just gives a little fuzzy. So it's watch, hold me. Holbys about maybe watch him move so that they talking about genes, about what was the DOL, see he went to grab up. Was He, so the dancers is a seduction. The seduction, they're both there. They're, they're engaged in a mutual seduction. Uh, this is a crazy dance. Jamie, what's the name of this? Show it to me. Guar. Say that Joe and Co is the rhythm one goal is the real you a lot more and when you're Ketos Ketos m u n e Q. U. I. T. O. S. D. My time's up. My Time's, this is the province then. Wow. Watch how she grabs a pussy every time he comes close.

Speaker 3:          05:14          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:15          Now that mute. Does it grab it seems kind of grab it and she blacked it. Oh yeah, that'll fuck around. That's hilarious. Drumming you're hearing and the use of what's called the Shaker Ray. That Gord there and the chanting that's going on that you would all, you would hear all that in a Santeria ceremony. Wow. This grabbing the pussy shit is hilarious. Hilarious. Hilarious. Yeah. He kept trying to kick out to his junk to occasionally, right originally, but he's probably just checking how are we doing down there? See like he's grabbing it. He's like squeezing it to see if it's hard. He just played with it. He just threatened the grab and she grabbed it. That's hilarious. So it's very playful. Flirtatious. Right. And this is the culture there? That's Cuba.

Speaker 4:          06:08          Okay.
