Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. Future Science. Yeah. That's what you're into. I'm way into future science. I wish we lived in the future, so that's where it goes. Fit in. I just go, I mean future science. I think I just think time. I think time is an illusion. I think that I'm more, did you ever see interstellar? Yes. I'm more in that zone. That's that smacked of good science to me. Like I was like, yes.

Speaker 2:          00:30          When you say time's an illusion, you mean like the watch is real? Like if it says four 30 that's when the movie starts, right? That's all real.

Speaker 1:          00:38          No, that's just coordination. That's it's, it's within our species. We're coordinating together. We're working as an ant colony. We are sending signals, which happened to be time signals were using math to coordinate,

Speaker 2:          00:51          but if you go underwater and hold your breath for five minutes, that's real five minutes. No, that's just when you run out of oxygen, so that five minutes, that is the counting of that time. Doesn't mean anything. Doesn't mean anything. No, it doesn't mean anything, but if someone's five minutes late, you're like, bitch, you're five minutes late.

Speaker 1:          01:10          Well, I'm never mad about that because I'm always late.

Speaker 2:          01:16          That's interesting. Um, well the only time supposedly is now and everything else is just are pathetic attempts at measuring it and trying to,

Speaker 1:          01:25          that's just coordination on like, you know, people like that's all we're doing. Like how old are you? Um, you know, and then that just means how crispy you are from going around the sun. That's not like really anything. Sorry. Yeah, you're like, sorry. Right skin. Cracklin you know, like it's just kind of that and to me like time is just, it's just space. It's like how far are you away from this gravitational pull? I think gravity is way more interesting. I think time is just us coordinating with math.

Speaker 2:          01:56          Well, we definitely are, but it's also like when the sun's coming up, like check your watch, six 15 sun's coming up. That's a real thing.

Speaker 1:          02:03          We're just clocking a spin of an earth. It's the same thing with the lungs under water. The earth spins

Speaker 2:          02:10          disagree with you at the same time. Yeah. That's fine. I think you're right. But I also think the fucking movie starts at four 30.

Speaker 1:          02:18          That's another human putting on a movie. It's true. Coordinating with giving me an example of time that is a manifest thing outside of human coordination.

Speaker 2:          02:29          Um, well you could the oldest, and I don't mean

Speaker 1:          02:33          like things happening, right? I mean time. Is that helpful in any way? Other than for us? I don't think it exists in the universe really

Speaker 2:          02:43          well. If the universe had a big bang and that was a point, I don't want Starbucks.

Speaker 1:          02:50          Sorry. What do you think? I think we're looking at, okay. Black holes, you know, say there's a train, right? We're at a where the depot. Okay. I love that word. Try to depot depot or home depot or a train depot. Okay. And there's like a giant but of a train. Right? Huge. I Dunno. 20 feet tall. 18 feet wide.

Speaker 3:          03:15          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:15          Filled with that. Likes that, that feeling of like, oh my God, there's great mechanical power. And then it leaves the depo, but you're still there. You didn't get on it. Right. And it, it just travels in the distance into a Tinier and Tinier, Tinier, tinier speck until it's just a little point. They, you can't see it anymore. Did the train shrink? No. Okay. So when you see all this matter going into a black hole, is it really hitting a singularity or we really condensing matter to that extent? Or is it just condensing to a certain extent and traveling in the distance? Is it going somewhere? And that's why we perceive it as gone.

Speaker 2:          03:57          It's, it's basically a run this by an astrophysicist,

Speaker 1:          04:00          then they break out the worm hall. But that's not the same thing. That's not what I'm saying. Like, and I think the big bangs or the other end of that process,

Speaker 2:          04:10          the under end of the process of coming out, that's a, that's a real, uh, thought. They think that, well, every galaxy has a super massive black hole, black hole that's in the center of it. One half of 1% of the mass, the entire galaxy. So the larger the galaxy, the largest supermassive black hole, the prevailing theory is that, or one of the prevailing theories I should say inside every black hole may be another universe. It's entirely possible that there's another universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with supermassive black holes in center of them, and he'd go through that one you go into, it's fractal and it just goes on forever and ever and ever. That's entirely possible

Speaker 1:          04:49          philosophy. And I think the whole Universe is spinning. I think the whole thing's a spiral. Yeah. Mm. I think they think that don't pay them within the spiral. You get the eddies, right, which are the galaxies and the irregularities and stuff, but the whole Shebang is also spinning

Speaker 2:          05:04          the multiverse ideas like legit scientists. Talk about that now that there might be different for that number of universes. Yes, I agree with that. There's so much more sense. What makes some kind of like the people that go, wow, that's crazy. Well, the universe is crazy. It's crazy. It's crazy that you look out and you see forever. That's crazy. That's fucking crazy. And when you look up, you're looking out, you're sitting on the side of a planet, like in the middle of the whole thing, right? Yeah. You're in the middle of this soup of, of reality, but to think that that's crazy, but that's as crazy as it gets. Like says who? Why would, why would you think this fucking infinite numbers of these things out there that were just a part of something that's so big. Like if you looked at all of the Zeros on that number, you wouldn't even be able to wrap your head around it.

Speaker 2:          05:46          You'd be like, what? What's a billion? How many? How many zeroes is that? How many billions is this? How many trillions is a billion and what? There's no way. It's too much. There's this thing, I love it so much and it's talking about it. It has to do with why we haven't seen aliens yet. The Fermi paradox. Yes. Yeah. I think that's it. Yeah. The Fermi paradox is like questioning why? Because there's so many different life. I mean, some different plants, it could potentially support life because like if there's 100 billion galaxies or hundreds of billion, and each one has a hundreds of billions of stars, how many of those have habitable planets and the if the, if so, why haven't they contact? Yes. Yeah, and like the math is overwhelming that either we're the first or they kill all the comers or, or there we're like, or we turn inward and go into the, what's the turn inward turning inward is the, the idea that we all go virtual and then we become some sort of a symbiotic thing connected to this, this hive mind, this real electronic reality.

Speaker 4:          07:05          Okay. Okay.
