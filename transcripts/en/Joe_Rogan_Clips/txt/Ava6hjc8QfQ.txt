Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. They don't really get their news. They read the headline and then they act like they're getting their fucking news. They're not putting in the time that aren't reading the books and actually going and reading a real newspaper reading, you know, um, you know that gentlemen Piss it. What pisses me off about politics? I feel like it's the only thing where like if you don't like, so if you don't, uh, if Lewis doesn't watch basketball at all and Jay watches every single sixers game, but then there's like a thing coming up where like something about a basketball game, Louis won't just like start arguing with you. Like not on how they need to play this defense. They need to go into a zone cause you're like, yeah, I just, I don't really know about that. But for some reason with politics, no matter how much anybody's not read anything, they don't know anything.

Speaker 1:          00:39          They have no problem. Just having a hardcore strong opinion. Like, because also you know about it, right? So when someone's like super argumentative about it, like, oh, you're, you're not even well-informed, which is most of the case with people that are really super aggressive about it. It seems like, I mean, do what they were, they had this thing where they were interviewing people at uh, the fucking march for life. I think they called it the anti like gun control march. Well, no, they were like all over, it's in a bunch of different cities and how we saw it, but it happened in a bunch of different cities. I think the big ones were in like DC and I think there was one out here, but there was this guy just interviewing people and he'd go around and ask them if they, uh, if they are foreign assault weapons band and they'd be like, yes.

Speaker 1:          01:21          And then he'd go, what's an assault weapon? And it's amazing how many people just didn't know. I'm not even, whatever your take on an assault weapon ban is, it's like, how could you be for banning something that you can't even define as just seems benign have. Hold on a second. Yeah, exactly. You're like, they know that this is what it does. They know, they know it's a rifle that shoots people. It's like a semiautomatic, it's not a hunting gun. So rifle is designed to shoot people like in a military situation. That's what it looks like. So they're raw. I mean like they don't know what an ar 15 versus an or whatever versus like what, what's legal, what's semiautomatic, what's, they don't know all the details, but they do know that these are guns that you kill people with. Okay, sure. Fair enough. But I feel like there's like a thing where there'll be like, well, while I'm for a ban on semiautomatic weapons, and they like, so you want to ban handguns soon?

Speaker 1:          02:07          They're like, no, we don't want to ban handguns. But that's the kind of guns or semiautomatic weapons. It's just like if you're going to protest, read a book on it. It's not just having a passive opinion. You're like out marching, want to, you know, they want to move the ball down the field though. And the more people that come out, they have kids that are like, you know, kids are in the fifth grade walking out of their classrooms. They don't fucking know what they're talking about or what they're doing there as a man. Sometimes there was a girl with armpit hair. You want to fuck. You know what I mean? How many these political opinions you don't mean that's true or dirty. Harry feed those girls to the Harry tone. Um, but I mean, but how many of these kids, this is a big one.

Speaker 1:          02:43          How many kids are against putting kids on psychotropic drugs, putting kids on unnecessary psychiatric medications. Parents dope their kids up all the time, cause they don't want to deal with some hyperactive kid. Some kid has got some fucking power, some energy bounce off the walls. And I was in, we were embraced the other day, right before the show we did. And there was a kid, I mean the kid must have had autism or or something or some extreme case of it. Uh, but he was like, you know, he was having some sort of violent episode, I'm assuming, but it was just a dad like commas day, just sitting on a corner with his kid, with a kid face down as the kids like screaming and shaking and kicking his arms and legs. And then I was just holding the kid down and it was so hard to like, I almost wanted to say something like, I didn't know.

Speaker 1:          03:27          I know they don't ever really like tell you what to do, like what's going on in that situation. And I kind of watch it for a minute cause it looked like he was abusing the kid for a second. But then you kind of realize after like, oh, this kid's gonna like hurt himself or whatever it was. But that's like a, that's like a really, really hard thing. Yeah, I can, I can accept more in the real extreme cases where kids are like severe, severe, severe problems, but it seems like they're just happy to like anyone's like hyperactive, just this kind of loose things that are Adderall. It's not a one or a zero. Right. It's like there's, there's varying stages of issues that kids are going to have and some kids are gonna need some kind of medication, but they're definitely over prescribing. Definitely. I knew my, my neighbor had a kid. There was nothing wrong with them. It's just a fucking kid. And they, they put him on Ritalin.

Speaker 1:          04:14          Adderall is a drug man. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's, it's not, yeah. I give it up. My five year old, we snorted together. If, if people don't get enough attention or they don't have an outlet and they don't know what to do with themselves, they get wacky. It doesn't mean you need to give him drugs. Yeah. Some, some of these people have legitimate issues and they probably do need medication and some of these people just need to find something that's interesting in life. Yeah. Well, I think what you were saying before about like, why don't these kids look into that stuff? I think a lot of times it's just like, people want the simple thing and you don't, you've got to actually, this is a really difficult question to get into this stuff. Whereas if you're just like, oh, I'm against guns, that's easy. I think it's the same thing as when people are just offended. It's like you don't really have to like read a lot. You don't have to know a lot. You just easy to be right, and you've got the answer. It's laziness. People can just pick a side very easily and go, cool. Everyone's already defined what's on that side. So yeah, I'm on that side. Look, I did my work right. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          05:13          Okay. Okay.
