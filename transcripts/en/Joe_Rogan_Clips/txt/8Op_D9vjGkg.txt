Speaker 1:          00:00          You see fit. Paris is going crazy right now given having these crazy riots. No. What's up? Every time I think about visiting Paris, there's some new shit that goes down over there. I know it's kind of feels like a little like a, like a jewel box is about to explode all that good man. It's not good. Is it workers? What kind of riot? Well the weird thing is everyone is riding is wearing those. I'm reflective vests. Like see that? Yeah, that's, Yup. They're wearing these yellow reflective vest and lighting things on fire and smashing store. So like who is Gucci inch? These? These protesters. They've been going scroll backups. When we got violent it says 17 pictures. Oh, it's terrible. And it keeps getting worse. It keeps getting worse. I mean it started November 17th when French driver sporting yellow vests let a demonstration apparently has to do with oil prices rising.

Speaker 1:          00:51          Rising fuel prices, 280,000 people. Four people have died. Hundreds have been injured. Thousands of dollars for the property has been damaged. The protest has started in November 17th from French drivers. Sporting yellow vests, led a demonstration of 280,000 people across the country to push back against the rising taxes on gas and diesel at, uh, French president in Menu Ed crown. I love a nice McCrone as part of his many economic reforms announced the gas taxes early this year to minimize Francis reliance on fossil fuels. That's a fucking shitty way to handle, you know, reliance on fossil fuels. You do the opposite. You can't face, well actually, you don't charge people money. You know, you don't charge people extra money and make it more expensive than they'll use it. The less you give them subsidies for electric cars, you stupid prick. Yes. Don't you understand the American way you piece of shit, Jesus.

Speaker 1:          01:42          I love talking like, well, they left Arteta about things I know nothing about. What does it say? [inaudible] black up there. Scroll back to where it was, uh, the price of fuel. That's it. 30 cents of gout and they went crazy. 30 cents a gallon of trying to kill people. Gas already costs about $7 per gallon. What friends? Fuck that man. So it's just going to break people's backs and they drive you to their bread. Sean Bush was leaving office and they jacked the fucking price of gas way up, dude. But there's people that were panicking, you know, September 11th there's like lines everywhere. Cause we thought right, empty. That's right. Yeah. But then the price didn't, I don't think the price randomly went up. Some places charge charging like 25 bucks a gallon. Assholes. They should go to jail. But that's, that's kind of insane that people use to have riots like that. When, when we would spike and people couldn't eat well looking at this, they were like in cars. The God, that's a shitty little car. Anyway, I probably wanted to light it on fire. Finally. He's not even part of the protest. He's just.
