Speaker 1:          00:00          For every, every day. They're always, it's just finding out how to do hard things is usually useful. The model, and it wasn't just the Higgs Boson particle that you guys had discovered. What is cork glue on plasma. Yeah. So that, that's, um, shortly after the billionth of a second after the big banks, you end up with a supervisor, quarks and gluons quarks and the building blocks of protons and neutrons and gluons are the things that stick them together. And so a proton has to up quarks and down Clark and an eagerness to down quarks and up quark and so on, so that the constituents, the protons and neutrons, which of the constituents of our atomic nuclei, um, savy go, if you get to very high temperatures are high energies, then the protons and neutrons faults a bits, then you end up with a soup of quarks and gluons.

Speaker 1:          00:48          And that's a quiet gluon plasma. And it's insanely dense, right? Yeah. Well, very high energy. So, um, so you get that. So we've been exploring that bite cause we don't, we don't only collide protons together. We can collide, uh, lead nuclei together or Silver Nuclei together at the LAC. And that's when you make these kind of soups of nuclear matter, if you like, very hot and nuclear matter to explore that physics, that nuclear physics. Wow. And I was reading something about the, the weight of, of that stuff that like a sugar cube. Like what, what is the, what does the actual weight, well, it depends. Our dense is that said, don't they? I mean, they were, the thing I remember is it the sugar cube of a neutron star material, which is, I don't know how many hundred million tons. I can't really, you know, the, it depends.

Speaker 1:          01:42          So I don't know where the quite Glen plasma, I don't know what number you're, there was something that was one of the things after the discovery, they were talking about the massive weight of Cork gluon plasma and were like, almost incomprehensible. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know the number, but, but something crazy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now one, once these, you got something, Oh, here it is. 40 billion. Oh my God. A cubic centimeter. Woodway 40 billion tons. Oh, good Lord. I didn't know that. I know David actually again. Again. Yeah. The dentist matter created in the big bang machine. What are they doing right now? It's um, close for engineering and upgrades and upgrades. Yeah. I mean, one thing we're trying to do is, one of the things in particle physics is that you want as many collisions per second as you can generate and then they, we have a collision.

Speaker 1:          02:39          We have a, what's called a bunch crossing LHC. We can vary, but it's something like 25 nanoseconds depending on what to say. It's really, we get a lot of collisions per second and the more collisions per second you can get, the more chance you have in make an interest in things like Higgs particles or whatever else may be out there waiting to be discovered. I mean, it's possible there are other particles out there that we haven't yet discovered that could be within the reach of the LHC. And if this one that was in Texas had gotten built and it was more powerful than the, than the LHC, you'd have even more opportunity to do something like that. Yeah. Now when these things are created by these collisions, how long do they last? Oh, fractions of a second. So that the general rule in physics, in particle physics is that they're, the more massive it is and the more things it can decay into, the faster it'll do that.

Speaker 1:          03:33          So basically the, the heavy things decay into light things. And so the only, the stable particles are things like electrons. Um, and some of the quarks, the quarks and down quarks is stable things. But uh, so, so everything tends to decay very fast. So we're talking fractioned billions of a second fractions. And how are they less than that? How are they registering it's existence? Like what is, uh, what is being used to measure it? So what you see if you collide the, at Aaic, we collide protons together in president's got loads of stuff in them, loads, ugly ones and the quarks. So you got a big mess, first of all. So most of it's a load of particles or spray. Now we should not interested in. But sometimes when you, when let's say a couple of the glue on this bang together and they can make something interesting like a top quark or a Higgs particle, what's a top quark?

Speaker 1:          04:27          I saw quite, it's a very heavy, there's six quarks. There's up and down chairman, strange bottom and top US harm and strange. So strange was literally in the, was it the fifties I, we discovered them. Someone said that's really strange and strange and you kind of farcical and so that, yeah, so we have six quarks and they're in three families. So the up and down or one family and then the chairman, stranger and other family in the top and bottom of the third family. And so we for some reason, so the only thing, the only festivals we need to make up, you and me are up quarks down quarks and electrons. But for some reason there are two further copies of those which are identical in every way except they're heavier. So there's the charm and the strange quark and if they're in a heavy electron called a on and then as a the tough and the bottom quark.

Speaker 1:          05:16          And another happy electron call the tail. And that's it. So that there's this weird pattern that we don't understand. So we don't, seems like you only needed the first family to build a universe. Right. But because some reason there are two copies now signed. The heavy ones decane to the lighter ones is the point. So when you make them, they're not around very long as just answer your question. What happens is that when they decay, they throw their decay products out into ad detector. So we, we take a photograph of the cascade of particles that comes from these heavier particles decaying. And the trick is to patch it all, look to see, to try and work out where everything came from. Wow. Now when they five find these unexpected particles, then what happens? Then there's the study of them. Then there's the, yeah, and everybody gets together and go, okay, what the hell is that?

Speaker 1:          06:09          Yeah. What is that and what do we do? So we want to know where the Higgs particle, we know what he does, which is it gives mass to everything. So it's fundamentally the thing that gives mass to all the other things in the universe at the most fundamental level. So, so electrons for example, and the up and down quarks. And again I mass from their interaction with the Higgs, that's why they're massive. That's another reason we exist. You know, we go ray back and we wouldn't exist if there wasn't mass in the universe. And the Higgs is ultimately responsible for that mass. And I keep saying, I keep caveat in it because then you get other sorts of mass that are generated, but, but that the fundamental basic seed as it were, is from is from the Higgs. Um, so what we want to know is we want to know how that thing behaves and the way, so you want to study it. So you want to make a lot of them so you can say a lot of pictures of it and study a lot and say exactly how he does that. And so that's what we're doing. That's what we're engaged in at the moment. We're making high precision measurements of the way that particle behaves so we can understand the laws of nature. I mean that that is the laws of nature. How are those popsicles behaving and what are they doing.
