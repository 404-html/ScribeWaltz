Speaker 1:          00:00          Four three, two, one. Kelly Slater, we've been talking about doing this for how long? Couple of years while makes for having me. Thanks for being here. I'm glad we finally got a chance to do it. What are you in California for? I know you broke your foot, right? I broke my foot real bad. I had to do that. My, well my girlfriend's phone, San Clemente and her family lives there and uh, so we kind of live here when we're not moving around too much. So I'm just going to here right now. I'm not competing. I broke my foot. I was surfing in South Africa about, um, 15 months ago and I was just on a wave that I wouldn't consider a very big wave. Nobody would really consider dangerous and it all kind of closed out, which is, you know, when it all breaks at once, I just pulled into thing cause I was going to sort of wash in on the rocks right where that was and change boards and uh, I was practicing, I had to compete in about two hours from then.

Speaker 1:          00:51          So I was just testing out different boards. For some reason I wasn't riding the board. I was planning on riding competition. So I was going to come in and change and switch to my norm board and I just pulling this wave and just, I kind of hesitated like usually you either ride those out and stay on your board or you jump off. And I was kind of a between the two and I kind of lifted my front foot off my back foot. My leg was straight cause I was kind of going to, I would think I was going to jump off and as my foot got my leg got locked back straight. The board flipped in oh against the toes and it just broke the top of my foot and a half. Oh like immediate like there was my God, yeah. We're looking at a photograph of the extra right now and it's like every bone it's snapped.

Speaker 1:          01:31          Well what you can't see. So the, do you know, are you aware of the Lis franc joint? Which is like, that's where the first big metatarsal comes together. So that first big joint on top of the foot there. Why is it called the Liz Frank joint list? Frank was a doctor I think is what I am. I could, we could look this up. I think that was the person that did the original surgery. When you used to break your foot in a stirrup back a hundred years ago, they said cut your foot off. Oh God damn ass. So that was what, what it, uh, that was kind of how this sort of joint got famous. But normally what happens is those toes, those two bones right there, the first and second metatarsal can either spread or converge one way or the other. And that's usually what a Liz frank fracture is.

Speaker 1:          02:16          I had the best of the three, which is, I had a crack. You can just see on the right side of, yeah, if you go down with a cursor right there, just a little lower, there's a little crack right there, uh, right there on that corner. And then the next one broke across. You can just see right there, it's cracked across. And so it kind of went in to line up and across the foot. And then the other two are just a straw. Yeah. The third one displaced the fourth one shattered into about eight pieces. The doctor said he lost count and putting them back together. And then you know, you, you would know from injuries. The problem with when the shatters of bone, they're not getting the blood flow. So it's not like a four or five week repair job. It's like that was like nine months before that thing was back together properly.

Speaker 1:          02:58          So when they do that, how do they piece that shattered one back together again, a delicately and they put like a mesh over. So I've got to kind of like figure out how to, well I had, I had a plate on the list, frank and then it had a plane play, a kind of a bridge across the third and fourth. And so they kind of meshed it all together. And then, uh, I think I had 16 screws combined in all that. God Damn it, it was, it was brutal. The problem with it was I did it in South Africa where I wasn't going to get surgery. Um, so I had to wait for the swelling to go down for about six days before I could fly. Oh God. Cause they thought the was going to swell too much cause it was already swollen from the event.

Speaker 1:          03:43          So I used to shit on my foot for like, you know, five days and sat there and watched. Unfortunately the waves were perfect, so I was sitting on the beach is watching perfect waves, you know, it's like, that's like as painful as the injury to a surfer, you know, it's like watching a bunch of elk walked by in front of you and not scary to you. Right, right. And uh, um, so I, I sat there because the whole time prior to me being injured while was there for like two weeks, the ways weren't very good. So I broke my foot in the way he's got great. Oh. So I did watch it, so that's painful for us. But, uh, so then wait for the swelling to go down and then I, it's too red eyes to get back there. No way you could get it fixed in South Africa.

Speaker 1:          04:21          I maybe could have, but then I was probably looking at staying in Africa for a month or more. And, and also I didn't know that the quality sort of level of quality of doctor I was going to get there. And I, I got a doctor I work with here and I called him straight away. I said, look, it's my fourth broken foot, but I've never broken it like this. Usually it's like let it heal for four weeks and you're surfing and it's all from surfing. Yeah. And in the same way I'll really, really pretty much the board going back against the foot fuck. Um, cause and usually it happens when I'm, you know, I don't know how well versed you are in surfing, but when I'm tube riding and usually with my back to the wave, which has happened two or three times, so I'm in the wave, the lip pitches over and lands.

Speaker 1:          05:04          But when that lands, it sends a shock back into the way, like, you know when the lip hits flatwater that lip, some of the energy goes down and some disperses out and up and some comes back into the tube. So if does that and you're in the wrong spot, the board will flip into your feet. But oh wow. Normally what we do is we're, we're, when your backside barrel ride, a lot of times you're grabbing the rail so you kind of have both your feet and your hand on it so you can handle that shock. But if you're just going no hand backside, it's usually a pretty big intense barrel. And so that lip has a lot of energy and it shoots a ton of force back towards you. And if, if the hit your board just wrong, it can flip in your foot and break it.

Speaker 1:          05:43          Do you know anybody else who's broken their foot? Like you, like that? Not this bad. Um, one guy on tour broke his foot. Pretty bad knee requiring surgery this year, that looking at, I'm horrible man. How long was it before you can walk? You're walking. Totally normal now. How long has it been since the surgery? Yeah, so, so I had surgery in end of July last year and then walking normal. It wasn't til maybe December, January. Wow. Well December I competed again, but I probably shouldn't have. But we were, we were at pipeline in Hawaii, which is, you're not doing maneuvers. It's not a small wave kind of comp. If the waves are small, I wouldn't have served. Since it's bigger, it's a little easier cause you take off and kind of trim a straight line. So you're kind of going straight, you know, even though you're riding the barrel, you're kind of going straight.

Speaker 1:          06:31          But are you conscious of your foot being compromised? Yeah. Wow. I don't know. I just, that's my favorite event in the world, so I just didn't want to miss it. But fuck if you broke your foot again. Yeah. But then, you know, the bones were pretty good back together then. And I could walk somewhat without pain. And if I put myself in a real vulnerable, vulnerable, vulnerable position on a wave, I would kind of maybe jump off. You know, I wouldn't really push it. It's not worth winning a contest foot again, but I'm sure to be able to surf pipeline with no one else is kind of worth the little risk now.
