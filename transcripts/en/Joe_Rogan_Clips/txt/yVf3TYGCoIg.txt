Speaker 1:          00:03          Like Edson Barboza but then you know, it's an instrument. Edson Barboza you saw once he realized he was going to survive, like when it was like two minutes left in third round, maybe ish site the first round. He's like, I'm getting, I'm getting fucked up. Just gonna I'm just going to survive. Right. But then when there was called minutes lots, he's like, no. And he was like, okay, I'm gonna fight again. I want to make it through this shit. I might as well if I were to make it through this, I might as well just fight back. Right. And so he started fighting back really hard like the last two minutes. F tried. He certainly tried, but there was a period in the middle where he like had resigned to just taking an asshole. Well, I think he was just, body was just not responding. He was getting so fucked up and you could see the pace that Habib put on them hard first round, like halfway into the Round Barboza is like Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          00:45          You see the look in his eyes, get that thousand yard stare. It's like, Whoa, what I signed up for. This guy's on another level. I mean he really is on another level. I'm fascinated by him fighting Tony Ferguson and apparently they're going to do that now. It's sitting happened April. I don't know if it's going to be for the interim title or the actual title within. They're going to strip Connor. They're in a weird way. Beats Up Tony. That's just my [inaudible] and I've underestimated Tony before so I could be wrong again. I just think, I think it's the, again, Trump card, I think Tony is kind of one of those guys where he's pretty good everywhere is pretty damn solid wrestling, high level Jujitsu. Uh, but I see Khabib dressing me and better than Tony's wrestling. So it's going to end up on the ground. And I think Tony's going to think he can submit him because his Jujitsu is very high level.

Speaker 1:          01:31          But I think it'd be one of things where it could be just good enough not to get submitted. And then he's going to land damage and land damage, inland damage, inland damage. And Tony's going to get close to a submission and close to a submission, close to a submission but not quite get it. And then all this damage is going to just accumulate and accumulate and accumulate at. That's kind of how I see it going. It's fascinating. And I also think it's fascinating now that could be, but has changed his training and has a real nutritionist, had no problem making weight. Yeah. So all the factors that played into him getting removed from the last time they were supposed to fight, pulled out of the car, those kind of overblown. He only missed weight one time. He only missed w wait one time. But his body shut down when he's making way for the Michael Johnson fight in a similar way.

Speaker 1:          02:14          But he still did the Michael Johnson fight. Yeah, but it was the same thing happened during the way and it was a rough way in. But there's been other guys who missed weight many times. I mean if we go to a Johnny Hendricks, Johny Hendricks, Melvin Gallard, Calvin gasoline, and they missed it by a long with, so yeah, I thought the QBE thing kinda overplayed. He must wait one time. He had some injuries which sucked for him. Um, but it was, that was happening for a world title fight, you know, they were fighting for the interim title him. He misses, wait. Yeah. I mean, and so it was one of those where he probably just like, it was like okay for him to make it, but be difficult and they just got just a little bit too big. Actually. Was it for interim title when he was supposed to, I don't think it was the original time.

Speaker 1:          02:51          It was Kevin Lee, right? That was for the world, Tom. Yeah. Yeah. Or interim title job that, Oh yeah. The whole, that whole division is kind of fucked up with Conner. Not even knowing whether or not he's fighting it. They're going to strip him, right? Yeah, mostly I think so. I would imagine, unless Connor says, fuck it, I'm in, I think the best comeback. Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. I want to keep me belt. I know the best course of action strip Connor let, let, could be even Tony fight it out. And then if Connor wants to go back, give him a title shot that's going to happen. Whatever. Well, I think the, what would be the most lucrative thing as Connor versus GSA? Shut up Joe on a fight. GSP. Oh, you do the one that I want to be number one. I don't want to fight Tyron cause we've been your friends for 20 years. Uh, I wanna fight GSP that that's who I want to fight. Do you think that they would set that up? They would know. They would try to set up GSP versus Tyron. Right. That would be the big super fund. GSP doesn't want to fight anyone who can hit hard because he's worried about the brain damage. So yeah, I don't hit that hard.

Speaker 2:          03:56          Yeah.
