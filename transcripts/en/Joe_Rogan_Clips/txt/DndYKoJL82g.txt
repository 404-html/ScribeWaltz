Speaker 1:          00:00          There are some efforts right now to try to de extinct some animals there. Thank you. Yeah, you mean that one new word and a w like what is, what is currently going on right now? They're calling it the dawn of de extinction and it's um, it's a lot of very, very intelligent genetic scientists that are trying to isolate specific genes that are specific to the animals that have been extinct and putting them into extent animals, animals that are still here to basically make this Frankenstein animal because it will never be the animal that's gone. Right. It will look like it'll behave like it will think like it, et Cetera, but it will never actually be the animal that we've lost. At least not yet. We haven't, we don't have that technology right now. What we can do is isolate a genome, put it into an existing animal that gives birth to an animal that looks and acts very much like the extinct down, but it's some degree different because it's like part like of a mammoth.

Speaker 1:          00:58          For instance, they would have to take some DNA from a mammoth, right? That they would somehow, or another get and introduce it to an embryo, but how much of an elephant and the elephant would give birth to a very hairy, very large Tusk, like these isolated genetic codes, elephant. And it would look like a mammoth. It would act like a mammoth. But the reality is it's a shaggy elephant with big tusks. Right. So if you did like 23 and me on it, it would show, oh, it's mostly LF. Exactly. That's a little bit of a mammoth. Yeah. I mean, if you think of a double helix, like a DNA strand, right? You have these little bars in the middle of it. So what they do is, this is a very crude way to explain it, but they pull out a bar from an elephant and they put in a bar from, um, a mammoth and then eventually you get this mammoth.

Speaker 1:          01:45          And so this would be like gene editing tools like crisper. Exactly. On those lines. Exactly. Wow. And so how far away are they from doing this? Uh, it's, I mean, it's been successfully done a couple of times. They've, Yup. They've given birth to a couple of animals that are very, very close to the extinct animal. Most of the time there's problems, right? There's, it's in fertile, it's a, it has lung issues, whatever it is. There's a couple of different cases. I'm not a geneticist, I'm a wildlife biologist so I don't really understand it, but it's, they've done it. They have successfully reproduce things that are gone basically clone things and then the animal hasn't made it to adulthood. Man, that seems really, really like playing. God does. It is, it is absolutely like playing God. I feel like, I mean is are people doing it just cause they can, is it one of those things or a zero, like a real valid scientific reason for trying to reintroduce these animals are d extinct them?

Speaker 1:          02:41          Well, the, the valid reason is to conserve the ecosystem, right? Like we talked about, but I think it goes back to what we were saying half an hour ago, which is, it's just that that quest for knowledge that can we do it, the innovation, right? Can we play God, can we fix it? Can we take this thing that's gone and say no, not like we have the tools to make it not gone. Yeah. There was um, some article that I read where they were talking about reintroducing the mammoth to Siberia and that there would be some ecological benefit to reintroducing the mammoth because of the way they forage for food. Sure. They would have some sort of an effect on global warming. Sure. Which I mean, do you know about that? I don't know about that specifically. You could find that Jamie, the reintroducing the mammoth to Siberia to benefit the environment.

Speaker 1:          03:27          Look whether that's accurate or not until you put mammoths on the ground, how do we actually know it's a great theory and that's what science is, right? It's coming up with hypothesis and then trying to prove them and it sounds cool. Like, do I want to see a mammoth walking around Siberia? Fuck yeah. But does that mean it's actually good for the world? Hard to say. Whoa. Could bringing back mammas help stop climate change? Scientists say creating hybrids of extinct bees could fix the Arctic Tundra and stop greenhouse gas emissions. I don't understand that. I find it hard to believe, to be honest. Maybe it's just some scientists clever way of sneaking it in because he wants to play God like, Hey, we're going to fix everything. Yeah. Fucking use coal. Who gives a shit? Yeah. Hamets we got Matt. Just give me the funding clean, man.

Speaker 1:          04:12          That's, that's sadly very real. Well, is it really? Oh yeah. I mean, look, if you're a scientist, right? Right. You, Joe Rogan is a scientist. How are you going to make your career? Are you going to make your career by raising money through being like, yeah, sure. Like I'll study cricket legs, or you going to be like, look, give me the money to stop global warming by bringing back fucking mammas like, right. You know, like why you can make the outrageous claim if you think it's going to fund your research. Right. That's how you make your bones. Right. And that's, that's one of the sad realities of some, certainly not all science.
