Speaker 1:          00:00          There was a funny story that I heard about a DEA undercover DEA agent who, uh, moved in to try to harass another undercovered DEA agent and they're playing each other back and forth against each other and they didn't know that both of them are cops entire time. If fucking assholes just wasted money, just wasted money investigating each other. So fucking stupid. Both sides undercover like what the fuck man, if, if Trump started talking about that, if you really want her to keep people around, if you really wanted to get people on the side, I think what he would do is start making drugs legal and started saying, listen folks, there's a reason why it was a problem in Mexico and when you talk to real economists, it really blows. You were talking about that on stage last night. Yeah. Yeah. The real problem is the drug war make drugs legal.

Speaker 1:          00:49          I wish I was thinking about that, but uh, well first methods of fucking, it's just such a fucking horrible drug. Ruthless. They make a lot of that in Mexico as well. It's a ruthless drug. It's a ruthless drug. But I think part of the reason why it's so fucked up is because all of it is illegal. I mean, that's a big part of why it's so fucked up is because it's not regulated. It's not measured. It's the doses or not. It doesn't say on the box what will kill you. You know, you can go and buy this old camp whiskey at any corner store, right? You just go in there and buy it, drink that whole thing, drink that whole thing. If you weigh a hundred pounds, you're dead. You're dead. We all know it's thinking about that. If I did run for mayor, I'd have a, uh, uh, like they have the gun exchange programs.

Speaker 1:          01:40          You have a meth exchange. Yeah. Meth for mushrooms. Ooh, that's a great exchange. Give them good drugs. They're doing this because it's cheap and available. Well, get them on good drugs. That's, that's actually a really good way to approach the subject. He wasn't, one of the things in hunters Thompson said, but he's running for sheriff a pick and county. He said, a, any drug worth taking, she'll never be sold. And we'll, uh, put a stocks in the middle of the seat in the middle of the city to lock up dishonest drug dealers. It's like, drug should be free, a good, we're going to rest drug dealers. I think if we made everything legal, we'd have real problems for sure for quite a long period of time. The question is whether or not you have enough resources to parent your kids to keep those problems from happening to your family, whether or not you have enough self control to keep yourself from being one of those problems and drugs become legal and accessible. But then once it's settled down from there forward, we'd be moving in a way, healthier place. And you essentially take all of the money out of the cartel. They're not making any money anymore. And then they're not going to be this murderous gang of suck you in. It's going to take a while for things to dissipate. But look what they did to Columbia. I mean, Columbia used to be fucking crazy and now you can go there and it's supposed to be really nice.
