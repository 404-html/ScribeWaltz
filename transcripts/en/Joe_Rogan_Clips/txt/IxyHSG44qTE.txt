Speaker 1:          00:00          Her low freak bitches. What are the things that you're seeing these days? I wanted to bring this up with you. Now that you're here, Jamie, pull up my Twitter profile. There was a tweet that I posted last night that I found this guy got in trouble for a fucking joke and he wound up leaving this, uh, this company that, uh, I think he's involved in video games. He's been on Dave Rubin's show and Dave Rubin was a raving about him. Look at this. Look what this Guy Ron, let's click on the one on the left right there. This is what he wrote. Ah, peace and quiet hashtag a day without a woman just to fucking joke. Just real simple Joe. Now go to the next one. Jamie. Look with the fucking international business times wrote kind of funny. He's Colin Moriarity resigns after targeting women in racist joke. Insist it's his personal decision to resign racist.

Speaker 1:          00:52          Did you see your race known as women or women of fucking race? Now did you know that that a dad joke about women is racist. That gets some brain surgeons over there. Ib Times got, wow, that's crazy. Get Some Vac of vacancies for real journalists to click on that, that, that quote again, look at this international business times. Fuck you. Why did he resign? Whoever this guy is, what does this guy by Mike Lewis Sluices Luke's is whatever you name is. Fuck you man. That is what you are doing, right? That is virtue signaling at its very worst. You know that's not a racist joke that that what you did is you, you targeted that guy, you went after that guy and you, you did it in a very deceptive way. That is it is. If anything, it's, it's just a joke and you might not like it.

Speaker 1:          01:40          You might think, well that's not really good if you're working in an environment with women, you know, like you don't want to hear them talk like that might be sexist. It's a fucking joke and saying that it's racist. Is it? That is so fucking deceptive and manipulative and they think I flipped back though. Calamari all, I don't know why he resigned. Maybe they're going to fire him, but what's this guy's article say? Well, how does he tie in race so that it's got to be that he has to have something that go to the, let's go to the article. There's no, there's no fucking connection. How could there be a connection unless y'all know, unless that's a race, unless women are a fucking race. It's just crazy that someone would think that it's okay to do that. I liked it. This guy is punching back though.

Speaker 1:          02:23          I kind of liked it. He's not just taking the quietly apologizing. Well he quit whatever organization that is. Um, that he was working for kind of funny and just decided and so many people that he was working with shit on him for that joke. It's just a Goddamn joke. And what, why is everybody so sensitive today and is it that they're so sensitive or is it that they're super ready to jump down other people's throats? Because they sense that this is a very hostile environment. And when you tell jokes, people are, what, what are you doing? Is this it okay when you, oh, he updated it. And by the way, people, I don't think it's the people who took down the word racist as raised it lost. You described it as a joke tweeted by comic, I was racist. It was not. The article has been changed to reflect this.

Speaker 1:          03:08          Still Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you man. This is, we've got a real problem today. And that people are jumping down people's throats for jokes and they're, they're doing it because they sense that they're soft targets, that it's, there's going to be a pylon and they sense the pile on the goal. Oh, this guy made a joke about women. Let's get him a bunch of people going to be getting them. This is a free shot. It's kicking someone while they're down. It's what it is. It's a drunk girl at the party and you're sticking it right in her ass. He, it's basically the same thing. They're mean the same thing. No, but it's the same shitty mentality behind it. It's that people like, uh, people, uh, they don't feel offended. They just feel it's a chance to be mean. And you can be mean to someone who does something fucked up or says something racist or whatever.

Speaker 1:          03:51          So yeah, people are just content. That joke is every episode of married with children. It is. It's every episode patient. Quite, yeah. David, a woman, Sha, quiet, peaceful family come on every episode of, of um, the honeymooners. So same thing. That was the word to the moon, Alice. It was threatening beating her. I know with his fist punching her into interstellar space and it was so great with that though. There's literally people would criticize that, but she was like the first feminist on TV because she won every exchange. She was, she was always right. He was at the big dumb fat cell and he was always fucking up. He does get mad and he would always get mad and she would all the writing and that the fucking, the, there'll be emasculating line she had there that some of the best lines. I don't want my salary to leak out your salary.

Speaker 1:          04:42          Couldn't drip out. Oh, what a fucking great line here. Right. Your salary couldn't drip out. It's a great show. Humiliating. And you know what, one, another thing about that show that was so great about the honeymooners and well that was the last one. A lot of previous sitcoms. No, I mean this is a, there was a groundbreaking new thing at the time that was a, it was on a cow, I think. Cavalcade it was called. It was some like the, all the y'all lost ones are like, some of them are 15 minutes, 20 minutes. They were part of it as a sketch show. The honeymooners was a sketch in an overall show. It'd be like, it was like dice when he started. He was just dice as a character in any Clay's act. That's what that was. Wow. It just became this thing which didn't do well and they uh, came back years later, but so funny.

Speaker 1:          05:24          But you could never do that shit today when you can do it all in the family. You can do it. There was a million movies that you couldn't do. You know what I mean? You try watching like older movies. What was it that we looked at recently in that we were lucky. There's no way you could do that today. There was a, an old movie that was a really fucking funny movie from like the nineties I remember which one. It won't kill a mockingbird guy. He's a guy. He's a bad guesser or not. Definitely. You probably couldn't do that one either. No, it was like one of those, Oh, oh, it was national Lampoon's vacation. I'm like, good Lord. I watch national Lampoon's vacation and she's like, there's no fucking way you could do that movie today. There we go. We get to, I don't remember it.

Speaker 1:          05:59          I've seen it was sexist and eh, you mean every massage and Dick? Like everything. Yeah, like there's no humor. Like humor has to be, it has to pass like these rigid filters now. Yeah. It's not as simple as say something inappropriate, but it's still funny that you don't necessarily mean like, one of my favorite comics and I think a great at one of the greatest of all time, is Roseanne Barr. I really put her as very funny. I put her as one of the most important comics of all time because I think that what Roseanne did was she, she had that powerful fuck you comedy as a woman. And it was really one of the first ever, cause women were more sedate in there, even if they were really good comics like Joan Rivers. It was a different sort of style of delivery. But Roseanne came out like a hardcore man club comic.

Speaker 1:          06:49          Yeah. You know, and she was shitting on her husband for being a fucking loser. It'd be at fat. And it was just hard and slamming. And I didn't take offense as a man. I didn't hear those jokes and going, yeah, I can't believe she shitting on man. Can't believe she's shitting on man. It was just funny to stop this. This is success. And it was so this guy saying, uh, you know, a peace and quiet, like, I'm sorry if you're not a Yappy cunt, that joke shouldn't offend you. Right. Okay. If you're a person who's a great conversationalist and you also happen to have a vagina that shouldn't bother you, even in the slightest. And it probably doesn't. It's just like, oh, I know that should bother me so I'm going to be shitty about it. I don't even think people care that much. I think they just liked to, to attack other people.

Speaker 1:          07:30          Exactly. That's what I'm talking about and that's why fuck you to that guy who wrote that article and especially fuck you because he called him a racist. Yeah. He did that on purpose because he knew it was going to be clickbait. Who's going to get people to go to that article and it was good to get people more excited about it without even reading it. Yeah. Cause all they need is the article. Most people are so fucking busy, they don't have time to read the whole thing. They're so quick to pull the trigger. All the, all they need is the title. What's the title? Oh, that's good enough. Fuck him. Let's tweet at him. Yeah, let's shame him. Okay.
