Speaker 1:          00:00          Nobody had ever scientifically investigated this until an incredible guy. I got to know cook Professor Tim [inaudible], who's at Knox College in Illinois and Professor Cassa, uh, made some really important breakthroughs in this. So there's two ways everyone listening to your show has two kinds of motivation in their life, right? We're all a mixture of both. So imagine if you played the piano in the morning cause you love playing the piano. It gives you joy, right? That would be what's called an intrinsic reason to play the piano, right? You're not doing it to get anything out of it. That's just, that's the thing. You lot of rice, I was like, you didn't see was like that. Bu Writing is like that for me. Everyone will have something in their life that just gives them joy as they do it. Right? Okay. Now imagine you played the piano, not, I dunno, not because you love it, but because your parents are massively pressuring you.

Speaker 1:          00:49          It's their dream view or in a dive bar that you can't stand to pay the rent or cuts impress a woman. Right? That would be what's called an extrinsic reasons to play the piano, right? You're not doing it because that thing gives you joy. You're doing it to get something further down the line. Right? Now, obviously we're all a mixture of both, but professor Casio showed a couple of really interesting things. Firstly, the more you are driven by extrinsic values, the more your intrinsic values are starved, the more likely we are to become depressed and anxious, but quite significant amount. He also showed as a culture, as a society, we have become much more driven by these junk values, right? We've become much more driven by think about how Instagram makes you feel. Sure. Right? We've become much more driven by this hollow external sense of it.

Speaker 1:          01:35          Think about something as simple as, well, a while ago I was the Elton John's last night in Caesar's palace, right? Amazing thing to be at and about half the fucking room is, is filming it on. That isn't even looking at Elton John. They're just watching it through their phone, that that's a small example. But you can see what they're doing in order to display their life, to invite envy from other people. They are not living their life. No one wants to watch your shitty video about. And John, there's a hundred thousands of, uh, of videos about and John that are much better than yours, right? Why are you doing that? You're never going to watch it either. You're doing it to say to other people, envy me, right? It doesn't make you feel good in that room actually makes you feel worse. You're not enjoying the experience and it makes them feel like shit because it makes you, you're trying to invite envy in your friends.

Speaker 1:          02:18          That's a small example of a much wider thing of the kind of junk values that have taken our minds. So the reason that relates to what you're asking about Brazil is Presser Kasler shown there's two sets of solutions to these junk values taken over our minds. One is, it's like fucking air pollution. You know, get the messaging out of your head. More 18 month old children know what the Mcdonald's m means, the know their own Cerner, their own last name, right? Um, from the moment it, professor Casap put it to me from the moment we're born, we're immersed in a machine that is designed to get us to neglect what is important about life, right? None of your listeners will lie on their death beds or think about all the shit they bought and all the likes. They got an Instagram. They'll think about moments and meaning and connection.

Speaker 1:          03:04          That's like a banal, obvious thing. But we're constantly pushed to not think in those terms, to think about, show it off by spend. Right? These junk values have taken over our minds. So part of the solution is just fucking get rid of most of this advertising. Get rid of most of this, you know, very tightly regulated. But in doing so, you limit commerce, you're limiting people's ability to sell things. You're, you're changing the current market that a lot of people don't have any problem with. I know this is a heresy in the United States, but limits in commercial speech is fine by me. Yeah. I've, I think it's fascinating. I think it's a fascinating discussion, but it is in the, in a sense it's limiting free speech as well. I mean that, and we have a real problem with that. The problem with it is that as soon as you start to put any regulations at all and you know, he say, Oh, you shouldn't be allowed to advertising to advertise, even if it's advertising, honestly about a great product that people were, we'll have real issues with that.

Speaker 1:          03:57          We already have advertising regulation. You can't, you can't pop an advert saying I've found the cure for cancer. That's what I'm saying. So this is still, I would argue this is a tightening. So for example, in London there was a big controversy, um, a couple of years back. Any billboards. Exactly. So it was this, it was a billboard of a impossibly hot women and impossibly hot man and the billboards that something like, are you beach body ready? The clear implication being, if you don't look like these people who you'll never fucking look like you're not ready to go to the beach. And the mayor of London City can just said this, you can't do this. Right. You can still advertise your bodybuilding, but that's so silly. I mean, this is a, it's not an unobtainable ideal. You're looking at two examples of it, but there are real human beings.

Speaker 1:          04:40          Yeah, but that's like, I mean, I know why I started listening. I mean, I'm not saying that you have to be that way, but if you do want to look like that man and have that body, it is a possible goal. Yeah. I mean it's not possible for the vast majority of people, right? Like if they don't have the time or the effort, it's not, but very many people have radically changed their body. I'm not saying, not saying you should do it. I decided this is a possible thing to do and if you're trying to sell fitness, wouldn't you sell an example of someone who's really good at it? Like if you're trying to sell a business course, wouldn't you show a guy with a giant house and a Ferrari? Like, this is a guy who's done really well at business, look at his penthouse apartment overlooking Manhattan.

Speaker 1:          05:22          You wouldn't show, you wouldn't say, well that's an impossible goal. I'm going to show you a person in a middle class suburb because this is as good as you're ever going to get. I think that's a fair point. I think it's two things going on, isn't there? There's the freedom of people to market what they want to do and there's, um, it's a nanny state issue that people have a problem with you by saying that these are impossible to achieve body goals. We already have regulation at these things. So people don't call that a nanny state thing. I think just this idea of regulation, these things, but that, that is not this. I don't think there's a good example. What to I was a better example. So Professor Kassar said there's two sets of solutions to these junk valley's problems. There's, um, get the contaminants out of the atmosphere sort of thing, which he says is actually a weaker one than the second set of solutions is.

Speaker 1:          06:10          So how do we stop people being pumped full of bullshit, junk valleys, right? Educate them on what is happening to them and make it less appealing. Well, this is the second part and you've gone to what I think was the most important part of the research professor Cassa did see, was working with a guy called Nathan Dungan. And Nathan is a hearing to be, Nathan is a financial advisor in Minneapolis. And his job was to work with adults who were found trouble budgeting and explained budgeting to them and help them do it right? And it gets a call from a school. It was kind of middle class school wasn't super rich or poor, it was a middle class, uh, where they're having a problem that the kids at this school, we're becoming obsessed with getting like the latest Nike sneakers or the latest iPhone or whatever it was.

Speaker 1:          06:52          And if their parents couldn't afford it, the kids were really freaking out. Right? So they say to Nathan, would you come in and just explain budgeting to these kids? Right? So Nathan goes in and he tries to explain budgeting and quickly realize is these kids don't give a shit about budgetary, right? There's something else going on here. They are so obsessed with getting these things. So with Professor Cassa, he designs this program that led to really interesting, uh, breakthrough and it's saying people can try at home, right? You don't have to do in this context. So they'd got, and you can do it just as adults, but they did it with, uh, parents and the teenagers, right? They come in, it was once every couple of weeks for think four months. And at first they just say the first meeting they had, they just said, write a list of everything you have got to have.

Speaker 1:          07:34          They didn't define that right. And people of course say like a home, a car, whatever. But quite quickly people would say Nike sneakers, the parents would name expensive things and they got, okay, tell me how you would feel if you got these Nike sneakers. Right. And very rarely, I only, any of them were like basketball players where it's like, I need the jump or whatever. If that's the right phrase. Um, it was very off ob almost immediately it's I'd be accepted by the group. People would envy me, right? These, these insights are just beneath the surface where they go, who put that idea in your head? Where did you get that idea? And of course everyone thinks they're smarter than the ad, but giving people the ability just to see how hollow those junk values, where that was the first part, second part was much more interesting and took longer than I would have in future sessions.

Speaker 1:          08:16          They'd say, well, okay, given that's not actually made you feel better. What are moments in your life when you have felt satisfied, happy in a flow state? What are things that are meaningful to you? People you know, a whole range of things. Playing sports or play music or reading, whatever it was, right? And they say, okay, how could we build more of that into your life and less of these junk values? How could you do more of this every week and just meeting? We'd have these conversations in our culture very often. Just meeting once every couple of weeks and checking in with each other and go, actually, I managed to play guitar for an hour every day. I managed on Saturday to take my kid to the beach and we went, or whatever it can to stifle materialism. What it led to, six is monitored by professor Cassar. It led to a significant shifts in people's valleys that they, they, they, they had a significant decrease in junk ponies and a significant increase in, in a more meaningful intrinsic values. And we know that that correlates with lower depression and anxiety over time. The weird thing is I sometimes feel like with all my, we both my books chasing, screaming, lost connection. So I sometimes feel like I'm giving people permission to know the thing they already know.
