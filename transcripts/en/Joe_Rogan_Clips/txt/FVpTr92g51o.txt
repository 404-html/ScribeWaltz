Speaker 1:          00:00          I guess DC when I'm broken head. No, no, no. He beat somebody in a very impressive fight. Oh, it was Roy who's big country. Oh yeah. I took it down. He kept, he kept taking down. Yeah. That was it. That was a long, the shit out of Roy could beat the shit out of Roy and it was a long fight. Right? Wasn't it like a five rounds? Uh, I don't know if it's five. It was three rounds of an ass whooping though. See if you find that is a monster. He's a bad motherfucker. He's a bad mother to help him. And frankly the most cerebral, I think. Thank you. Got clipped with a punch before. Main advantage. Oh Wow. I'm impressed. He does look very fit. Who? So he must've been heavy when he started camp. Since world, he's really heavy. That's what it, he didn't fight for a little bit.

Speaker 1:          00:38          So you know, he's been commentating and find a Russian ship. Interesting. Here. Here we go. This is only three rounds. They don't do five round main event. So only title fights. Here we go. Can you, what do you think about that? I kind of agree with that. Yeah. I'm not mad at it. I like five rounds. Three rounds. It goes too quick. I like five rounds for smaller weight classes. So good point. My, my thing would be, man, the five round fights are beatings, man. I mean, you really, oh, it's over. Oh, it's over here. Clipped him clover. Oh, trouble. Oh, he's surviving now. Whoa. Take down. He did frank. He didn't have the under hook right there again. That's why frank stood up. Oh, barges. Throw. Oh holy. Oh, I was gonna be a quick one. I thought I was going to be a decision. Yes. This is phenomenal. If it's on finch. Oh. Oh Shit. Oh Shit. It's over. That's it. Oh Dang. What a war. Dance.
