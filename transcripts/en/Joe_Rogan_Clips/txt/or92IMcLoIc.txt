Speaker 1:          00:00          The ultimate fighter. Correct. He really couldn't train properly with it. Yeah, that's, that's, it's going to be a different animal in the future when people aren't worried as much about permanent damage. Right. I hope I need it because I do a lot of permanent damage. Yeah. The gym most damaged today's permanent damage. Wild excursions. I go on. Tell me about the cave dot. You want to learn about cave diving. Kay. So first of all, Katie wants to take you, she takes you, so you learn about all these different rules of the water and of the nitrogen levels that you're taking into your body. Um, any of the cave diving is about five years. And I got my certification in high school and I am a super cave diver man. I love it. I love it. I love, I love diving. I love everything about diving.

Speaker 1:          00:56          I love Shipt diving. Um, so no days, caves, you name it. I love it. So we were in Cozumel a couple weeks ago and uh, one of my old, you could almost call him instructor. He's taught me a lot of what I know about diving today. We a dove three or four days and some buddies of mine that were down and uh, goes and Mel just went through. Some ships went through, some k are, uh, like, um, it's the coral reef just playing around down with them. And then we go and do a s a a serious die always. He's getting a little bit older. His mind is still very, very, very sharp. But his motor skills don't keep up with it much anymore. Right. And in, in, in cave diving, it, uh, it's very necessity that you need. So we jumped in this cave. Let's rewind to 20 minutes. I just kissed my girl and my new baby and she's like, don't, I don't really want you to go like right. I don't, he just, I don't want to say his name, but the guy you're going with, like I'm worried.

Speaker 1:          02:03          I said, what are you worried about? I said, I'm coming home. Come. This is what I come home every time coming home. Fuck. I Dunno. So I pick up another, I order another, um, cylinder of air just for x. So I have to, originally I'm going with order another cylinder air. Just, I told her just for, just for, just to fucking had it, right. No one's ever died because they have too much air in cave diving, you dive in third, so if we have 300 PSI, we'll do a thousand psi. N would do a thousand psi out and we have a thousand psi in case something fucking happens. Also in cage dive in, they have lines. You run these in a cave. The law already have a line running. A bunch of guys like me, tech divers have gone into caves to cover them. They mapped them, they named him and they put put lines so you can follow them in case something happens.

Speaker 1:          02:55          Right. Get in and get out lines and lines and none of the lines really connect Schaeffer like the main lines. We'll have like three or four main lines down. Big channels of the cave because caves are huge. Right? From an intern to the main line. Usually no one has a cave. You have to, you have to make it. It was called a jump. You have to make your own own line because they just don't want someone listening on deer today to go find a cave, jump in and swim down and be able to get in and out and get lost in there. Now also, we have a Thailand incident. We're looking to want him to say people. So we make a jump tie off. You put these direction arrows down. Um, they're called cookies, right? Pointing out towards the direction out of the cave is that way if something happens, you come out, when you make a jump, you take your light, you wrap it around your neck, and then you have two hands that work on the line. The Guy I was with didn't follow some of our rules. And in cave diving, it's kind of an unwritten fact that you only worry about you. I'm coming home, right? I'm fucking staying alive. So Joe, you mean I were Dave diving. If something were to happen, I'm not going in there to get you. No reason for two of us die when only ones in there can die.

Speaker 1:          04:10          So he tries to tie off his points. He fucking hits the roof of the cave, kicks his feet, spins analysis in this line that's supposed to be tied off, which is our fucking lifeline is now wrapped around him. So I swim over to them and I try to help him unhook this line and he goes into panic and panic kills everybody involved. Everybody involved dies with panic. And that's something that I can't express enough. So he starts fucking freaking out, hitting the roof, spinning silk fucking over. And I just back out, take about four or five big strong steps back when I grab a hold of the main line. Now it's silting out. Now when I say something silting out, there's all this like sediment, the ends on the bottom of, of these caves. And you were like a little tiny room. So if you kick your fin hard, it kicks up like dark dust, mud, sediment, silt.

Speaker 1:          05:06          You can't fucking see anything, blacks it out. So I back out of the silt. I grabbed the line and I see him in there fucking freaking and panicking, spinning and rolling around and getting all caught up in this and this line. And I'm like, fuck, I just stay calm. This was the exit. I know where it is cause I know where I am. There's the exit. He was making a jump to go down another tunnel. There he is. Now what I just tell you about the rule that someone comes home, right? I broke the rule and I went in to get him. I said, Fuck God down. So I let go of the line and I go into get him because there's light fucking is off now and I'm thinking, God damn, he spun up in this line. Is Lights off? Did he drop his ray? He later is he had air. Is he okay? Soon as I go, the sill fucking lose everything man. Lose my way. Where I am, my up, my down. I don't know where I am. A fucking panicky now I'm panicking. Fucking freaking out more than any I've ever breathing hard bang. Hit My head on the fucking ceiling and I just closed my eyes and I'm like, God dammit Kelly, calm the fuck down. Calm the fuck down. Calm the fuck down. Breathe.

Speaker 1:          06:22          Can't even see my hands in front of me. I have two watches on their glowing right. Those are my [inaudible] let me know my death, my time, everything, or I have to, to, to dive computers. I check them. I look, I calm, I checked my lad, I got to turn my light and burn, burned my, uh, our, um, pressure gauges, their glow in the dark, right? So I charged it with my light and I look at, okay air, check my second one. Okay air. I know my third one's good because I haven't even opened it yet. That's just, just in case I breathe down, I fucking think, and I can't even see my hands in front of me. And to this day I closed my eyes and it gives me nightmares. Write him out, just thinking about it. Cloudy, dark, can't see anything. All I can see is the home of my light.

Speaker 1:          07:01          So I turned my light off. I'm not trying to think of like, all right, just, just, just calm, calm yourself, figure this out. Where's, where's our partner? I start feeling around and he's nowhere to be found, right? Nowhere to be found. So I'm now, I've called myself a little bit and I start feeling the walls and I start moving around. I'm trying to think where am I? But I don't know because we haven't been down this channel yet, so I don't visually haven't made an imprint of, oh there's that. There's this right. Kind of like a mental imprint in my mind. Cause that's what we're doing as we're coming in and landmarks, right? I don't have any of those. I don't have any field. I don't have any touch. And I'm moving around, moving around. I took a compass reading of the direction of the front when we tied up at the first jump, right?

Speaker 1:          07:49          So I know 126 degrees is the way out, but in a cave they twist and they move and they're up and they're big and they're deep and they're low. Right? There's no rhyme or reason how the water made the cave. So it's kind of a direction I can think of. First thing that comes to my mind and I start swinging that way. Now. I hit a wall, boom, and I go down. I hit a wall and I'm fucking in panic mode again. I fucking swimming now. I just start swimming and kicking a fucking going crazy. I make my way out of the silt and I fucking turned on back on the main line, right? I find the main line to the cave again, which is a hundred yards to the front to the door

Speaker 1:          08:31          and grab a hold of the main line. I fucking real it. Anyhow. Okay. Now the entire behind me deeper into the cave is free. It's no problem. Silt free. I can see everything's good. We're I need to go is fucking self out and blown. Gone and completely fucking wash. I can't, I couldn't see you sitting there, but I can see everything behind us to can't see you. I have the main line, but I don't have the jump line to get the fuck out. So I started thinking, I was looking in the cave maps to try and like before we went in, just to try to get a visualize of, of, of the direction. I'm trying to remember landmarks, but I can't see anything and I can't feel, and I'm like, fuck, there was a split up here. So I start, uh, go back into, back into the silt again.

Speaker 1:          09:20          And I started feeling around and I'm feeling, and I find a hole. And I'm like, is that the right way? Is that the one I want to go down? Where does that one go? Okay. Maybe remind, remember, remember, remember? That's okay. Let's go to this next one. I go into the next one and now this is, this is where it's gotta be. I'm going, but all of a sudden I'm swimming against the current. And I remember when I came into this cave, there was this very slow current, which is why the entire caves now washed out from that point on, right? The current is taking out. So I'm like, fuck, you're swimming against the current, so you're going the wrong way. I somehow work that into my fucking panic mind. We're all swimming into the car. We're swimming in the corner. That's overall going the wrong way.

Speaker 1:          10:01          So I fucking turned swim back. I'm back on the fucking main line again, right? A find the main lines clear. I out into the clear main line. Fuck, fuck, fuck. I start like hyperventilating and panicking and I'm thinking, man, are you fucking you piece of shit? This is how he will die. What the fuck are you right? Keep reminding, kissing my wife and kid by kid saying, I'm coming home today. I'm coming home. I'm coming home. So I'd do it again. I fucking venture into the fucking great unknown. Fucking a bis. Total blackout. Another panic. Panic. Fucking freak out. Can't find a way hitting my head. Chicken losing air by the fucking second, Bro. Cause now I'm breathing hard on breathing. Fucking irrational and I'm sucking my tank's dry right? Mind you, I'm on air, so I don't have, there's no, there's no answer to this. After I breathe my last breath, keep checking within. Keep keeping my time. Look in direction. Time, time, air, time, fuck slowdown. Slowdown, slowdown diamond pitch, fucking black. Can't see anything. Trying to figure out where I'm at. What I'm thinking, what am I doing? Okay, we're running out of air. How much time do we have? Kalbi war at 28 feet. I know we're at 28 feet. I could probably read on this for about another hour on this tag. Another hours. We've got another hour. Okay, we've been in here fucking 38 minutes already. How? What are we going to do?

Speaker 1:          11:28          Start trying to find my way out. I can't. Trying to find a way out. I can't now. I started thinking, what am I going to do? I'm not going to drown Joe drownings like my biggest fear of my life, so it was a thing that's called a BC and we carried on her bag. It's a buoyancy control device. That's how you, that's how you control your buoyancy when you're scuba diving, right. It probably holds 20 big, huge strong breasts, so I feel that motherfucker up. This is my plan. MOFILM IBC up, which throws me to the top of the cave punk. Right now. I'm only now I got to flip upside down and I have like crawl on the ceiling trying to figure out where the fuck I am, how I'm at now I've got to get out of a cave upside down and I'm thinking, all right, we've switched to our last bit of air.

Speaker 1:          12:21          How are we going to do this, Calvin? What are we going do? We filled RBC up. When I run out of air, I'm now thinking in my mind, how am I going to die, Joe, right? Tell my wife, tell my kid I'm not fucking, I'm coming home now. I got to fucking realize how am I going to die? I have a notepad that you carry in your pocket to draw on. Right on. I'm thinking of what? What? What are you going to say? What's your, what's your letter going to be? You're writing a fucking death later. You're awake. You're a fighter. We figured this out. They will fucking find a way to Kuwait. You fucking bitch. He's the conversation I'm having with myself while I'm in fucking bleed. Panic morning, complete darkness, thinking that there's no, this is how people die. What the fuck are you doing?

Speaker 1:          13:02          You're going to write a letter to your fucking kid and tell her how you, how you fucked up. I'm sorry, Daddy's not coming home. So I'm fucking thinking I'm not going to drown. I'm not going to breathe my last breath. So I'm to breed this BC that just fill up with air and I'm a fucking breathe it until the oxygen level no longer happens and I'd just pass out. That's, that's my, that's what I've come to realize how I'm going to die. I'm going to fucking just slip away and pass out, keep breathing the same air until

Speaker 1:          13:29          I go away and I start thinking, you fucking piece of shit. You're, you're giving up. I think you're having the legitimate conversations with myself while fucking NP complete panic. Like you're, you're going to quit that. You're writing a letter and you're gonna fucking breathe your last air until you pass out you fucking pussy. You're a fighter. Figured the fuck out. So I'm upside down and crawling on the ceiling. And I remember when I came in, we came in the big cave and as like a huge fucking crack that runs along the top turn both of my watches off now at this point, because they're giving off light and I kill my light. I said, that cracked going to fucking lead to the surface. That cracks going to fucking give us something. So I just call start panicking. Me Panicking again because I'm panicking. I don't know what to do.

Speaker 1:          14:14          I'm sucking air and a fucking breathing hard and I'm hyperventilating and crying on the sitting, crawling on the ceiling, looking for this fucking crack and God damn it, I found it. I found the crack and I followed the crack and the crack got bigger and all of a sudden I see fucking glow. Like green glow. Crawl on crawl cron. Find it. Try to get up. My tags are too big. I can't fucking get out of the little hole. Can't get out of the hole. I'm fucking big, big, big, big fucking hitting, screaming, freaking out. Calm down, calm down. Calm down, Kelly. This is the way, calm the fuck down. Reel it in. Reel it in. We're here. We made it grab control, fall the cracks and more opens up out, boom. There's theK fucking I'm out made it. You're coming home. You are Doug about. Wow. That was the feeling. Meanwhile, my guys out there, I can't be mad at him because he panicked. He grabbed the line, he fucking ran out the hole. He looks at me and he says,

Speaker 2:          15:21          MMM,

Speaker 1:          15:25          so we're not diving together ever again. We, I said, no, that was it. That was it. And I texted my girl, I love you baby. And uh, they was a fucking scary moment, but daddy's coming home and it was fucking so crazy because that was, I mean, I've almost died numerous times, but almost dying slowly, which puts it in perspective to me like these guys on death row. What? I always thought like, yeah, fucking killer murderer man. That's fuck him dude. Knowing the time and how much time you have left, that's some scary shit, Joe. Knowing that you have two hours left, how much air do you have left at the end? Maybe another hour. Probably an hour and some change.

Speaker 2:          16:15          But

Speaker 1:          16:16          could you imagine how I had to talk to myself, how I was going to die, like to me that fuck me up. Fuck me up really bad. Like I probably had to go do some costumes and ask myself two questions now because that fucked me up bad. But the inner me, the fighter, the youth do new fare at the fuck out. But was I going to write a letter? I was fucking damn close to write in a letter. It was crazy, man. It was wild. Damn. Hold on. I explained that. Good for everybody. You explained it like a motherfucker. Yeah, I'm nervous like I was there. Fuck Dude. That is crazy. Yeah man. And I'm going to do it again. Like I'm not scared of it like that. It's just needs to be done better. I'll run my own motherfucking line. It also shows you how important it is.

Speaker 1:          17:09          Like what your wife was saying, you can camp. She, you know, she, she knew something. She had a sense like right when people fuck up a lot or when they're just that person that just can't keep it together. You gotta be real careful around those people. Yeah. Yeah. Fucking crazy shit, man. I mean, that's why people kill those people in war. Yeah. You know, they just like, look, we can't do this. Yeah. We can't. Everybody killed. Yeah. Your, your, your panic is sure. Yeah, sure. Yeah. You're not hanging in there. You, you've become a detriment. Fuck Dude. That is one of the craziest stories I've ever heard in my life, but I'm glad I got to share it with you. Fucking impressive.
