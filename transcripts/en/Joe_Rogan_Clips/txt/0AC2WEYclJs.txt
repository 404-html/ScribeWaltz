Speaker 1:          00:00          Oh much money involved in these movies. If you're going to make a film and he, you know, it's some gigantic thing with special effects and the studio is dumping hundreds of millions of dollars into it. They want a return on their money. I saw people discussing that. I think Johnny Depp was just kind of kicked off isn't the right word, but he's not going to be in the next pirates movie. I guess they were discussing under that like in the comment section like it was the word last one was the worst one of the of the lot and they spent $330 million on the budget, but it made 800 million and they're like, that's a fail. Some people were saying like that's a failure. Yeah, for them it's a fairly a hundred million as it is not good. Well, Johnny's off the rails right now. He shaved his head, Johnny Depp, he looks like he weighs 35 pounds.

Speaker 1:          00:46          He shaved his head, he's fallen out of his jeans. Whenever you get like two tattoos of a woman, the only been married to for like six months. These are all bad signs, joke, and this is a very rough town to live. Egos and mother fucker. People blowing smoke up your ass as a motherfucker. Sure. I mean this guy is spending a half a million dollars a month on wind. I don't know exactly. Don't quote me on that, but I know that I read that. Did they say, they said that he was spending $30,000 and he goes, it was a lot more than that. He was joking around about it. It was a lot more than that. Like are these pictures of him now stay humble or be humbled? He's wearing a shirt, dude, you're 55 years old. Why the fuck would you wear that shirt? Well, who's walking up?

Speaker 1:          01:35          Meanwhile I got a Derrick Lewis. My balls was hot shirt on, but look, these these like fucking inspirational quotes you expect to see on some strippers Instagram page. You're not supposed to be wearing those when you're Johnny Depp. Okay, this is, this is outrageous. Giant Dep. Why are you wearing that on a shirt? And I heard that this last movie, the Mucho Mucho. What? Pro Banglaz which a lot of problems. What was the moving the Tupac, but it's on shelf, right? They're not putting it out. Is he the shelf? Yeah. They're not putting it out for right now. It's not coming out. I see a cop, the cop, that broker, if you will. I forget them. That's a good book. Yeah, though. Whatever. I forgot. I have it at the house. He plays the cop in the area that there was a loan level and the word got out.

Speaker 1:          02:25          That's it. Well, you know Johnny Jab at one point in time when he had done that, that movie dead man. Do you remember? Dead Man? Interesting movie. It was a weird black and white movie about a guy who was riding a fucking train across the west. He was talking in an interview about it. He wants to do interesting projects. He goes, I'll, I'll never be blockbuster boy. Then he became blockbuster boy, but he's bad ass and pirates of the cow book. He's fine. I don't give a fuck whether they be phenomenal, phenomenal. He's really good. Good. I love, he's a great actor. They cut him loose. He made a ton of money for them. They did five fucking movies, but you know he's boys with Stan Hope, right? Essentially Johnny d this fucking motherfuckers with there. Everybody thinks you're going to spend money on their website. Guess what? We're not, we're not paying to read your fucking website.

Speaker 1:          03:20          We're not Johnny Depp. What does it say? And biggie, Tupac. A movie abruptly pulled from release for Twitter. Granted it looks like. Mm. Yeah, like a month before it's supposed to come out. They just pulled it. Well in my suck. They don't pull it up. It's awesome. But the point is, you know, Stan helps boys with him and he's like, he said that once he did those pirates movies, he couldn't go anywhere. It was over. He can't go to restaurants. You can't go anywhere. He just can't go anywhere. He, he hit that upper echelon of fame where it's almost, there's no turning back. When you know, you get like Michael Jackson type frame. You just get crazy. You, your, your world is just, it's no one can relate to you. What were they giving them per movie? He was making like 30 million a movie. We're back ended everyday. I bet he was making more than that than that, right? Yeah. That's, he's got like 18 houses, both 14 houses. You know, I remember when I was in Colorado, someone said he had a ranch out there. I go, has he ever go there? He goes, no, no. Just has a ranch.
