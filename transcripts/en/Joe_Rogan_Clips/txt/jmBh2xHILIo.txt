Speaker 1:          00:00          But now I'm more the, uh, thing I've become obsessed with lately is there's a skepticism about Ufos. Yeah. That's why I want to talk to you about this because you told me that you've become obsessed with Ufo is recently. Oh yeah. Completely. And it's like, yeah, totally. Really? Yeah, totally believe the UFO phenomenon is real. I don't know what it is, but it's totally, it has to be real. Some things happened. Why is that? Because there's just way too much evidence that it is real. What evidence? Uh, well, uh, radar evidence, uh, that the, the f 16 locked on a Ufo, that footage and also just, uh, like I know that friend of ours, I don't know if she wants to say it, but her father was an air traffic controller and he told her, they said, yeah, every air traffic controller has seen something.

Speaker 1:          00:47          Yeah. And I had another friend whose father was in a commercial pilot and she said, yeah, my dad said every single pilot has seen something and they've all been told not to say anything about it. We got a couple of friends that say they were a like, yeah, you know, the abducted one is a little easier to wrap your head around because when you're sleeping, your brain is producing all sorts of indogenous psychedelic chemicals. Yeah. Almost all of these experiences happen when you're sleeping. Almost all these experience, when these people were abducted, they're taken from their beds, which is when they're dreaming. I mean, it's just like there's some real clear, easy steps to follow up on a fall Ockham's razor and not, you're not get crazy, but it knocks those out, but it doesn't knock out like Barney and Betty Hill and all the people that are abducted will fully conscious and that and that remember it without hypnotherapy.

Speaker 1:          01:30          I'm like, I'm not sure about the abduction phenomenon, but I don't know Barney and Betty Hill. I know the story, but I don't know them. Yeah, so I would have to know them because there's a lot of people that I've taught, like I did a show for Scifi, I called Joe Rogan questions. Everything that cured me and show cured me of a lot of my nonsense with, with conspiracies when we used to talk about it. Yes. Yeah. That stuff all the time. All the time. Yeah. Yeah. But I, I needed to actually study it. So for six months, that's basically all I did. I interviewed people and I like big foot believers, Ufo believers, and the one thing that they have in common is they all seem to be kind of lost and dependent upon this thing being real. Yeah. Instead of being objective. There's only one lady that I interviewed that saw big foot that really seemed to be telling the truth, but I think she saw bear bear's walk on two feet all the time.

Speaker 1:          02:26          They do it all the time. It's video footage. You can find it all the time. And she was in the Pacific northwest, which is incredibly dense woods. You see something, you'd glimpse it. Look, I was hunting once in, in, in Canada and Alberta, and I thought I saw a wolf for like two seconds. It was a squirrel. Okay, I understand this. This is what does that note, squirrel? Yeah. No, I just saw far. Right. I saw it for and I was, because it's really dense was cause I was looking for fucking wolves cause I was like, cause I know we did see one wolf. It crossed the road is either wolf or coyote was hard to tell cause it was

Speaker 2:          03:00          at dusk. It was very dark out. But um, when you're looking for something, you think everything is that thing you're looking for. Yeah. So for like a, for a second, a huge thought that fucking squirrel was a wolf. That's funny. Yeah. Well the expectation and perception are very linked. Yes. Yes. Well this is also that they've found that, uh, that 50% of everything you see is a product of memory. Yes. That, that when you observe something, they've done FM, FM ris and that most of the activity in the brain is in the memory centers, not in the, uh, visual speakers. Only about 50% of the activities and the visual centers of the brain. That's crazy thing is very, I, when I was a kid, I went and saw Carl Sagan speak at u of t at the University of Toronto and I was like, you know, 14 but he did an equation on the board of the possibility of an alien life other than us in the universe.

Speaker 2:          03:53          And it came to the smallest. I mean he spent the whole time writing on this chalkboard. It was fascinating. They actually came up with a number at the end and it was such a small, he says there is, there is something out there, but they are so far away that they'll, that unless they can go faster than the speed of light, which he said was impossible at the time. Yeah. The Seventies. Yeah. Uh, there's no way we've seen them. That's what he said. So if some other beings have conquered the speed of light thing, then maybe we could see them. Yeah. But that's a thing with the exact problem with his skepticism in general is like that it, you know, like, like the skeptics, skeptics of the, of the 19th century, the ones who said germs don't exist. Right. Because we can't see them. And people who've said germs did exist were ridiculed and laughed out of the trade.

Speaker 2:          04:52          Right. And, um, I, I agree with you completely. Just because you can't see it or it isn't happening. It doesn't mean it can't happen. And even since sagans day there had been no exoplanets discovered then we now know there are literally trillions and trillions of sure planet earth like planets. Yeah. Well they just speculated as to the existence of them outside of our source system before the, the real problem is that if some, there's a leap and a leap, a technological leap that opens the doors to massive innovation that once this happens, once this happens in this, and then all this stuff sort of exponentially expands in terms of technological possibilities, all you would need is a few hundred years and you have an unrecognizable set of technology. Yeah, sure. I mean we were talking about certain, I mean the whole anti matter idea that they're still trying to figure out, uh, that's an insane sorts of energy.

Speaker 2:          05:52          You have never even experienced, you know, with them with a grain of sand. And you can run a city and it was that big. Yeah. And then there's also the theory, there's reason one, that space time itself doesn't exist. So the, the speed of light barrier becomes moot because that is, I guess it's the holographic quantum hologram theory, quantum holographic theory of the universe, Talbot's book. Uh, I can't remember holographic universe, but it's, yeah, I think so. But the idea that the universe is basically just a geometry that, that when you look at it from a certain angle seems three dimensional and it folds [inaudible] folds into itself. So you could, and it's travel. That's the wormhole thing. And it's not even that, it's the idea that, that, that space time is an illusion is, uh, and that, that it doesn't really exist. And that's why, uh, you know, like, uh, uh, entanglement is possible.

Speaker 2:          06:47          You know, the idea that, you know, spooky, spooky action at a distance that a quantum entanglement. Yeah. But the reason that you know, you know, uh, these, you know, Adam's on opposite ends of the universe can be affect each other instantaneously, is cause they're not really at an opposite ends of the universe. They're really right next to each other. It just seems like they're at opposite ends of the universe because our ability to perceive is basically based on what we have to do to stay alive on this planet. So our meager little chimp brains, you have trying to, trying to quantify all of these things that are around us all the time. So we put them into this sort of three dimensional box of movement and distance and that the entire, the entire universe could be a compact thing that projects itself, like a hologram onto a screen.

Speaker 2:          07:36          I love these kinds of conversations because I'm clearly too stupid to really understand what I don't understand anything I just said and I don't understand you too. So how stupid does that make me? Well, we don't understand each other. We're all the same. Yeah, that's what I like. I think it'd be interesting to do a documentary or something about, uh, about Ufo ology. Cause if one thing is the assumption that they're extra terrestrial is an assumption, but I think it intrigues me is the power of ridicule to silence. Even the most intelligent people in our community from examining something like the ridicule kept doctors from accepting germs. Sure. Because they didn't want to, they didn't want to be ridiculed by their peers. And even now you've got people that will, like Michael Shermer will cling to the most absurd explanations for phenomena like the f 16 a radar footage. Uh, what did he, what was Michael Shermer, I can't even remember, but it was, it was pretty, it really went to great lengths that entailed having to basically, uh, diminish any respect you had for any of the people who reported on the events. It had to go and had to go into character assassination in order to eliminate it. Yeah. He was the best way to kill an idea. He's a professional skeptic and I like Michael a lot and he's been on the podcast may times. I actually had him debate Randall Carlson

Speaker 1:          08:56          and um, Graham Hancock about these ancient civilizations and it wasn't very good for them. Like there's some clunky moments cause skeptics are believers. Well the problem is, Scott, the problem is being a skeptic itself, it's a stupid way to look at the world. You're actually sure about something. I mean, you shouldn't be objective, right? It wouldn't, don't be skeptical. Being skeptical is like, I don't know. But I know for sure that that's not true. But it serves a massive purpose for people that really don't understand things and he can explain it to you. And with actual science, as long as the actual science is being used and it's not, character assassination is not mockery. It's not, it's not. There's certain people that are just debunkers, they can call themselves skeptics, but they're not looking at things like, oh, maybe that is effective. Maybe that is healthy.

Speaker 1:          09:48          That is interesting. And No, they don't look at it that way. They're looking at, they're trying to pick it apart. And that's fine if you can pick it apart. But if you cannot, you have to be objective about the fact that, oh, well this is a very interesting phenomenon and this is what we know about science is that, and this is what we know about this thing. And right now we have, we have a weird conundrum. Chariots of the gods. And did he end up on kid? Was He, was, he believed that hundred percent. He's all is still in all in. I asked him, the first thing I asked him, I said, what is desperately have to go pee go. The first thing I, uh, asked him was what is the most compelling piece of evidence does that, you know, and he pointed to this, um, a Mayan stone plaque that's in [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          10:35          I'm gonna have you ever seen it? It's a, it's in the book. Yeah. It's a, God, uh, one of their, um, one of their former kings that is lying on his back and he's, it looks like he's moving some, see Jamie, see if we could find that thing. It's just really cool, uh, carving that they found that looks like there's a guy who is in a seat. And it looks like there's fire behind his back. And you could say, you could say that he's manipulating controls on a ship and he's, you know, shooting a rocket into the heaven. I would like to see what the s, the mainstream version of that is. Because it also, it could just be art, you know, I'm imagining being, yeah, it could be that they, they knew about certain things being propelled by fire. There it is. Yep. That's it.

Speaker 1:          11:24          So if you see this, I mean that's a big ass stretch to say that guy's in a spaceship. I don't know what the fuck that is. He's sitting down Altera kind of. He could, yeah, but it doesn't look like he's looking through an ips. Right. What's true, but what does that mean? Is it a telescope? Maybe he's just kind of telescope, but maybe they just an astronomer. Yeah, it is possible. I don't think they had telescopes. I don't think it telescope was even invented till, no. Do they even have a glass at that point? Oh No. Well, I don't know if the Mayans did. Wow. But, but that was his number one piece of evidence was while Alan was like, that's kind of silly when we were kids in the seventies the, you know, big foot, you know, and cherry to the gods and everything was so new and look at this image, look at the bottom of it.

Speaker 1:          12:09          Even the part where the flame supposed to be coming out from below him. Which Flint, where's the flame? The flame is the shit. The very, very bottom. But I mean I'm not even sure I buy that. If you were going to draw fire, you do a really shitty job. If that's your fire, that doesn't really look like fire to me. Could be anything. Right? If, if that's fire, like what is all the stuff around them? What's all that stuff? Is that, that looks kind of mechanical though, right? It looks like there's bolts does. If they have a fire, God maybe they drew the fire. God, it looks like a monkey kind of face with titties. Monkey's got some titties. Oh now I get it right. And then the monkeys, is that his teeth? It's the first tutors arms. Actually it does. It could be armed. But th that's the point is it's so open to interpretation. There's so much that you could see if you're looking to see. But what I do see is this guy who's, he's reclining and chilling and it looks like he's looking through something. What's that thing hanging across him? You see that thing across his arm.

Speaker 1:          13:12          But here's the thing, I don't think anybody knows what the fuck that is. But so for him to say that this was the number one most compelling evidence, I mean, where people getting high at this point? Oh yeah. So I mean that could be just some guy got high and LSD. Yeah, they were, they were taking different kinds of plants that had like search like acid in them. So what is this obsessing? What is your, your more recent obsessing about Ufo is, what's the origin of this? Well, part of it is just the fact that, that the evidence, just the evidence itself says you have to take this seriously and yet no one does a, or very, very few people do. And even like I, again, that f 16 footage that even Neil degrasse Tyson who is a great skeptic said, uh, on one of the late night talk show, he said, well, if you really want to look at the possibility of some a non human intelligence, that f 16 stuff is pretty compelling.

Speaker 1:          14:10          What is the fcoe STD stuff? That's the stuff that, uh, to the stars academy put out. It was the CIA Tom Delonge. He's crazy. I had never met on the podcast. Yeah, very nice guy. What do you see? And he said she's a very nice guy and a brilliant musician and he's a loon. Yeah, I've never met a fucking full on believer. He left blink one 82 to go do this to the stars academy. Shit. He's the biggest goddamn rock band on the planet. Okay. Here's something interesting about this and this was pointed out like by, um, okay. Film video film by fighter jet shows an unknown object near San Diego. Video from 2004 was released by the US Department of Defense. Um, while the way it moves, there's something about the way it moves is really weird. Huh? Jet Though one of the pilots told the you immediate the object was not from this world.

Speaker 1:          15:04          Hmm. Yeah. And here's the thing, it's like the skeptics in order to dismiss that, they have to go, well, if I have to make arguments like that, jet fighters are not better observers than anyone else. Pull up Mick wards take on that mic ward, the guy who he runs deep, um, uh, what does it met? A bunk metabolic can runs a debunking site and he's another one of those guys that is all in with the, the conventional explanation goes way out of his way to not look at anything that could be yes, yes. Comes Razor says, you know that if you have to go to great lengths to dismiss something, right, that's not falling. OCKHAM's razor razor says if the jet pilot says he saw this, he saw it. I think he had an interesting take on it though. And one of the things is there's a time during the video where the pilot shifted from one x to two x, which makes the image a move more because you're, you have magnification.

Speaker 1:          16:03          Like have you ever use magnifying glasses by knows? Like if you use a 15 x by knows it's very difficult to hold on the sec yet, but six six you can kind of look at things in the distance. Yeah. But that's, if you don't have about about $3 million worth of stabilization equipment on your jet and walked onto this object, right. Which is why that stays in Loc. He had an explanation then that was kind of interesting and when it breaks free of the lock and how does that got unbelievable. But can you just take off or something like that? It just, at one point, just the opposite, just breaks free the lock. And that's almost impossible. I have a clad sound possible for anything that manage bills to do what? The quality of cameras today. Why is this footage so shitty? Uh, that this is infrared footage?

Speaker 1:          16:47          Yeah. Yeah. I mean, do you need this? When you're shooting at things in the sky, you can't rely on [inaudible] when you're looking at heat. We can't heat signatures visually. It's so far. It's so far. It would be gaming the rabbit hole. How to debunk conspiracy theories using fact logic and was just so, what is he saying? What is he saying? Uh, the program [inaudible] a little larger for my stupid dies. Said a for all. He made sure you were talking about the right video. There's two that are confused here. We're talking about the gimbal video, which is not from the Nimitz incident. Just discussed here. So scroll down a little bit. Uh, the gimbal video is an okay. Yeah, that's the one we're looking at. It's an unknown date and location from an up from unknown pilots. Nope. The tick tock one. Some cells pilots. Yeah, that's 2004. Okay. That's David Fervor of the media is discussed. These videos, Tom Delonge to the stars. The link contains the frames. What's he saying? Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Uh, the black shape on the object. Some kind of infrared flare

Speaker 2:          17:50          glare. We know that the shape of a very bright infrared source, like the engine of a plane can be much bigger than the object itself is explained here. Okay, so this is like a flare. That's a little, explain the mood. It doesn't explain. Again I'll comes razor is, okay, so this guy, this guy is saying it looks nothing like it. Well even if it is a jet, a jet is not capable of breaking free from the lock. Right? So lock onto it. And if you look at that, you can see the jet and his own example. Debunks is debunking need not be moving. Yeah. The video need not be moving. The assumption that that this guy doing probably a few hours research has come up with something that is more credible than a trained fighter pilot who was there and visually seeing it. What do you think have been tracking?

Speaker 2:          18:40          If you had to guess? I don't know. Let's get crazy. Oh I would. I think it is. It is. It is an intelligent craft is a craft being piloted intelligently. Why aren't they talking to us? We're fucking apes. And why would you go and talk to us? We're assholes when you look at it. Yeah, I forgot. You're right. Leaving fucking plastic straws everywhere. Oh, we cured it. No more plastic straws. When you're a kid looking at a, an ant colony, you didn't go listen to me aunts. Yes. You just looked at them, you know, there was, and they said, why? Why don't they go to the White House? We said, well, why would do when you look at an ant colony go, I must speak to the queen. Yes. No, I've always said he was looking at ants. Yeah. That's what the most ridiculous thing about like the old movies, like the old movies, it would land on the White House lawn, right? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          19:34          That's it. Yeah. Burrata nickname, whatever that thing was. Yeah. Clock Lot to burrata. I'd like to talk nick too. Yeah, that's the, uh, a day or two still was like, is that 1940 or 50 50 50 50 fucking great. Great movie. I watched it really recently because it's a terrible variables. A little bit, right. The stories are great. He was a Christ pair of, well, his name is John Carpenter. Oh, I see. That's right. It was a carpenter shoot that object out of his hand. The first second he pulls it out. I remember he has a thing that's going to cure cancer. They shoot him, they shoot him, they shoot it out of his hand to meeting him. And then at the end of the movie he is a, he is killed and resurrected. That's right. Right. Yeah. They shoot him. He's taken the robot. The robot.

Speaker 2:          20:20          That robot robot. Yeah. Very tall. Yeah. And like he looks like you would want a robot to look in 1950. Yes. Yeah. All metal and shits moves. Yeah. Chrome. Yeah. Those, those were the days we thought that they would communicate like it wasn't there a whole rash of them that we're seeing over Washington DC. Yeah, there was, yeah. There was dozens, dozens of Ufos tracked and admitted by the government that they were tracking them and watching them. But they, uh, essentially, and then at the end of their explanation was, yeah. Nothing, nothing particularly important. You know, we have a mutual friend who claims won't say her name, but she called and I wrote her off as a lunatic when I first started. Yeah, well she was claimed to be adopted and then I was doing a show with her years ago and she just telling us the story.

Speaker 2:          21:09          We're all like a, Huh, that's pretty funny. And she says it and they took a scoop out of my back and I'm like a scoop. They took a scoop out of your back and she showed on her back shoulder. There was a hexagon, old diamond shaped scoop out of her back. Uh, a divot that hexagon. Yeah. That was clearly, clearly and no scar tissue. Maybe she's a crazy bitch. No scar tissue, man. Yeah, give myself a little punch, but I hole punch back there. Worked at a bookstore at the time years ago and I went into the alien section was the world's biggest bookstore in Toronto. It was the name of it. And of course I went to the alien section and just look all this crap up immediately. And there are other people with the scope. Well there's a lot of other people with, you know, abduction stories and some of them have like little pieces of something in their body.

Speaker 2:          22:00          I remember you talking to me about this many, many years ago. I was like, oh, well Dave's interested. It was like implants. You're talking about people that have alien implants in their body. Yeah. And that's the thing is, to me it's just, I guess the thing that I'm kind of obsessed with now is just the cause we're comedians. Yes. And the power of ridicule, uh, to silence, debate is unbelievably potent. Sure. And we're part of that. We're part of the machinery that was used very, very consciously by the government to silence any inquiry. You know, it was like, you know, feeding it, you know, feeding the story the right way to late night talk show hosts, made it so that nobody would talk about it. So do you think that the government consciously fed those ideas to like Johnny Carson and those folks? There's documentation of a, of a pro, you know, of that they, you know, to, uh, to make the UFO phenomena ridiculous.

Speaker 2:          22:57          Do you think they did that to avoid mass hysteria? Like if you are, you're the government and you know, there's nothing out there, but you see these people freaking out and go, okay, look, we've looked, we've used all of our military might, all of our scientific power and we don't see shit. I'm not buying this, but these people were freaking out. This has the real potential to get out of hand and go sideways on us. Let's just start making fun of this. Yeah. I don't know. Cause, uh, I think it's more likely that there's something there that they feel powerless to control. Do you think Kennedy was taken down into the basement of whatever and shown the alien sitting there and what I say about aliens with in regards to Trump, if there's anybody that would fucking tell us it's hair, he tweeted it tweeted immediately tweet it. Tweet economic aliens. You Fo's are real. But CNN is fake. Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 1:          23:47          yeah. It's still the failing New York Times sales define you at Bose right back at area 51. If the government does have the evidence, they're never going to show it to Trump. That's the problem. Like what the fuck's the point being president if you can't find it. Yeah. If I knew that to become president meant you get all the access to Ufos, I might go. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So very good. I'm going to try for that. The presidents who have tried haven't gotten there. No, no one gets it. Like Jimmy Carter, Jimmy Carter said he was, he, he's, he had a Ufo experience. Yeah. He saw something, right? Yeah. He said he saw something, but see that was back in the 70s where everybody was seeing shit. They were all talking about things was part of the zeitgeists people were legit, like after close encounters of the third kind, especially people who legitimately thinking that aliens were going to come.

Speaker 2:          24:36          Yeah. He proposed such a possible scenario and that movie was so good. Yeah. Anything you expected it was going to be. But like I was going to say, here's like another example is like the Rendlesham, like, like that explanation of the sixteens locked, you know, footage, uh, like Rendlesham forest where the, they claimed that these American soldiers in the woods, out in England, uh, mistook the light, a light house light for a spacecraft that they were within 20 feet of a craft that they saw and took notes on different lines of yeah. They walk, not even like right up against it. And he wrote down notes all like different set of hieroglyphs on the ship itself described it's, you know, described the, the feel of it, this electrostatic feel of being around it. And the official explanation was they missed, took a lighthouse several miles away for this spacecraft.

Speaker 2:          25:35          So I'll comes razor against us. That's hard to believe that these trained observers and that's the other thing. They always tried to dismiss the idea that trained observers are better observers. Um, but they are better observers. Sure. In the age of today where everyone has a high definition camera in their pocket. Have you taken, have you taken a photograph of the moon on your, on your phones comes out sick? It doesn't look like the moon. What's true, right. There's no details. It comes out of the lung. The lenses are too wide, but, but I'll comes. Razors has all right, they saw something but they, you know, cause what is the likelihood that trained observers who have been on this base for years on this night would mistake a lighthouse that they've seen every night for the entire time they've been on this base for a Ufo? I mean, what is the likelihood that that explanation is correct?

Speaker 2:          26:27          I'm not aware of that store. Oh, Rendlesham forest. Yeah. How'd he say it? Bent Woods. Uh, Rendlesham and r. E n d. L. E. S. H. A. M. Rendlesham forest bandwidths. It was two nights to get character actor on Colombo. Where are you up for? You have an of his own and it's a nuclear installations. Rendlesham forest and nuclear installations are always ripe with Ufo stories. Yeah. What year was this? Ah, this was in the 80s. Yeah. Mm. Interesting. And it's, you know, and it said, obviously the obvious explanation is we're not the expert. You're, the only thing you can accept is that these observers saw something. Right. You described it accurately. Is it something that had crashed, if you want to say that? No, it came down was, was, uh, landed in the forest and, and took off. What do you think of the [inaudible] case the night before that? Roswell. I think it's probably true where he'll, you're all in.

Speaker 2:          27:21          Yeah. Well David on about it. But I mean, because the interesting again, because the, because the cover stories for our so much less believable than an alien. Yeah. I just, I would joke about it. Yeah. They put it on the paper that they've recovered a crashed Ufo and alien bodies and the next day set up, we made a mistake. It was just a balloon. What about, what about the aliens? Those Mexicans, Mexicans, they were drinking, apparently they thought the balloon was opinion, Yada. They got a little crazy in right now. But, uh, we just invented some new stuff. Yeah. Out of nowhere. And then 30 years later they go, oh, we were, they were high altitude a dummies that we were dropping. That's right. To test how they would fall. And that was, we have lasers and visibility cloaks. Well the, they showed up again the next day with a bunch of weather balloons, scraps and they're like, look, this is what the guy holding it up.

Speaker 2:          28:12          Like what they don't tell you is that they flew the wreckage out to Wright Patterson air force in two separate planes and the Truman met them there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah, the more rational who separate planes because they were worried that one would crash the, the weather, the weather balloon thing is not as rational as something weird happened. I listen to, I want it to be alien so bad. Oh, I questioned myself. So that's my problem. I want to do that stuff. But I again, I, I won't, like, I'll be skeptical about stuff that just seems crazy or people that, you know, Billy, you know, sort of ascribe some sort of metaphysical explanation for all of his, uh, my, my thing is just, well, if the preponderance of the evidence says something happened but doesn't tell you what happened right, then you still have to believe something happened. Not knowing what happened isn't evidence that it didn't happen and yet you're still a flat earthers. Yeah. Have you looked outside? It's seems fly. Yeah.
