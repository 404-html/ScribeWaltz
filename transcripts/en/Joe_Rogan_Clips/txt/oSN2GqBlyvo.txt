Speaker 1:          00:00          Sometimes just, dude, sometimes people hang things. They hang things in their garage and the cold too. So you mentioned were hanging on I think about is Jesse some, oh my God. Talk about said No. Whole bunch of people back in one interview. Crazy story itches. It such a mess. It's a mess. And I think was really awful about it because his story, it was, it was like good and bad of it to good of it was when people thought that he was violated and he was a victim of a hate crime. It wasn't just gay people. There was a Russian to support him. It was like thug dudes, you know what I'm saying? It was like some real motherfuckers. Dell was like, I mean, I saw exhibit, make a comment. It was a community of people away from the LBG community to thought it was really fucked up.

Speaker 1:          00:55          Yeah. And that's, that was the beauty of the incident because it kind of put people together. But the fun thing about it was just a lot and it's so fucking unfortunate. It's so unfortunate. Somebody would play on people's emotions. Yeah. For or to benefit themselves. It's, it's awful. Well this a certain narcissism that exists in show business there. Thank you. And I both know very well, you know, we've all seen it and thankfully the people that seem to be the best for whatever reason, they have the, with some of the best handles on it. Like Dave doesn't show any of that. Right? But there's some people that do and that narcissism is weird that that wanting it to be all about them and then they'll do sneaky shit like faking attack. Like that's, that's a symptom of that same kind of thinking. It just, it just got desperate and went in some crazy way.

Speaker 1:          01:49          It was officer a reason because you have people, like when I first went down you had people that normally people that you would look at, okay that's my friend or whoever you started having side eyes and that's just, it's just, it's so messed up. And I think also as messed up as much as people wrote for him when they thought that it was an injustice, everything, nobody's really talking about it. Nobody's addressing. They're like, you know, this is our movement. These are things that we were trying to progress toward, but this was an isolated incident and just say how awful it was. Yeah. You know, the beautiful thing is that people are way more tolerant than they ever have been before. They're also beautiful things. Attack didn't happen. Right? So I don't have to think of one more atrocious thing that people have done to another person for no reason.

Speaker 1:          02:32          All right? So that's good. And it's also good that you get to see where that kind of stuff heads where you're always looking to be a victim to the point where you realize there's like some sort of currency and being a victim. So people fake being a victim, right? So they can get all this fucking attention. It's good for us. It's good for us to see. Cause you see that now next time a story comes around, that's just a little fishy. You going to second guess it. Exactly. It's like the boy who cried wolf. And that's what's unfortunate about it because anytime someone says that they were a victim of such a heinous crime like that, you want to believe them. You want to believe them. I mean they said, well this is, it makes you start second guessing thing and that's another thing that was awful about the whole thing and all the smoke he's getting right now and he deserved, because I've been tearing his ass up on Instagram on everything he did.

Speaker 1:          03:16          He deserves every bit of it. He knows he deserves, everybody knows he deserves it. I read, I read a story once about this dude who said that he punished his daughter by making her sit in the backyard by a tree and then he went out there an hour later and she was gone and the suspect that coyotes got her and I remember thinking that story going, man, that just does not sound real. That does not sound real. It just seems weird. Yeah, you just kind of left a baby in the backyard and coyotes got it. Like reading was like a new, like not walking or anything like that. Well, he left the baby like to punish the baby, like a two year old left it in the, well, it turns out he really didn't do that. The kid died and he, he'd stuffed it in some drainage ditch somewhere.

Speaker 1:          03:56          So this, uh, I don't remember how the kid died. What was the reason for it? But it was one of those stories where you hear the story like, Jesus, it doesn't sound real. Sometimes stories don't sound real. The next thing we're going to be second guessing everything. I hope not. But when it first went down, I thought it was a, I've thought it was a situation where Lee Daniels and Jesse sat down in a writer's room and Lee Daniels, Lee, anybody got any ideas for any new episodes? It just like, I got one. Nobody's going to believe it. Look, I'm going to be hungry and shit. Right? I'm going to go to subway to get a 12 inch footlong elite. Dan, who's like, I believe that.

Speaker 1:          04:37          I believe that part day with her, the whole story elite. Danny said some, nobody's going to believe it. Jesse got upset. It told the totally dance. We'll see. I'm going to shoot him myself, and he walked to into that whole scenario and it's just awful. That's entirely possible. That's what it sounds like. It sounds like. Now you're gonna say now anybody that was a fan of empire, which I know a lot of people that are listening, we're being very sarcastic. When I say that, they're going to be like second guessed. The storylines of so many of those shows, the storylines of everybody, whoever's said today, we're done wrong or anything. The awful thing about this is now people are going to be ready and quick to just second guessed anything that you say.
