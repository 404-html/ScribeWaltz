Speaker 1:          00:00          They separated them. When Damien had one hook in, he was trying to take us back. Dude was that fucking homeboy, the guy who kept saying got it. You were seeing people were scared of him, but he wasn't beating anybody. That was world class. He wasn't, he wasn't getting those top 10 guys. Amy, Maya, right. Yeah. We got same to Damien. Maia fight will forever be marred by the fact that they separated them. When Damien had one hook and he was trying to take us back, dude was that fucking homeboy, the guy who kept [inaudible] him up with that daughter. Oh my God, I don't know what he's doing. Or you didn't see who that was? Go go to Damien Maia versus um, Camaros. Huseman and see who, who separated them. Cause the Ref Matt, uh, Matt, the Terra Sarah was going fucking crazy about that. And he's 100% right.

Speaker 1:          00:47          Do you know how difficult it is to get a hold of a guy like Ooh, spawn like that. And to have one hook in, standing up and to be working to take us back and for them to separate him, it is nonsense. Pure nonsense. How much harder it is. That's hard. Yeah. How much harder is to take Woodley down and control him? Yes. And then you stand them up. Yup. Yup. If a moose man, what the fuck are you doing? Do you mean you stop and think that you should come down? You stop and think about Damien Maia his last fight. Right? Who the fuck? Who the fuck did he just choked unconscious fuck out of? Who was that? Who Was it? Who did he just choke out someone really good, um, kid that they fed. Okay. So here it is. That's not Goddard. Who is it? Uh, is the bald feller. Which bald feller? So here's, um, so here's a, it's hard to tell who that referee is. I can't see the face. So it loose man in them. They're, they're exchanging ooze. My cracked him. Who is it? I was it Chris Taione. I know two referees. I know three. No. Um, it's Leon.

Speaker 2:          01:48          Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:51          Well for whatever reason, what was God thinking though? I don't know what he was thinking. And then he's shade online at Jon. Anik. What'd he say in your commentary was off. So it was annex. You got my commentary was on. Yeah. Okay. I don't know what I did to say. I didn't say anything bad about Mark Goddard. I said I don't, I disagree with them standing up. I don't know why he said the commentary was off, but Dominick Cruz did say that he can't wrestle. And the reason why he's standing him up is cause he can't wrestle. Mark honored. Yes. No, he said though he's, he was saying that about Mark Goddard. Correct? You've said the referee can't wrestle. He threw shade. It got her. I have nothing but respect for God. Although I don't agree with his decision in that fight. I do not agree with standups.

Speaker 1:          02:32          I don't like stand up garden. He's a great referee in that moment. He's wrong. Well, he's probably not very emotional. Listen, your job is not to intervene. The trajectory of the fight, right? Your job is to protect the fighters. No one fuck up. Ooh. Spins. Biggest fight of his life by standing up. Because what happens to this and we've seen it. Why would it be stood them up and boldly goes, you know what, fine. I feel good. Knocks him out. Right. You got it. It can happen. Yeah, it can happen. What did he say about me? He didn't specifically call you off. He didn't call you. I suppose what he say but, but, but the only thing wildly inconsistent is your and your cocoms commentators recollection. Observation of actual events. I will look Joe Rogan's ass. That's wrong. So rude. I didn't see that. I just made that up.

Speaker 1:          03:20          The only thing wildly inconsistent is your and your cocoms recollection. Observation of actual events. I'll save my side for later. Well that doesn't make any sense. Recollection of actual events. I don't know what he's trying to say there and cocoms I didn't say anything bad about them other than that. I don't agree with the standups and that's not bad job. But Dominick Cruz said that he can't wrestle and I don't know if mark odic or Russell, I know he knows how to referee compared to Dominick Cruz. He cannot wrestle. So Dominic's fine to say that. But also John Annika and harden the paints. Awesome. Yeah, I like that you are way off. What's wildly, wildly inconsistent is correct cause herb dean is the gold standard in my opinion. And Herb Dean, even though he did that thing with Robbie Lawler is controversial, kind of look at it and I go, the arm went limp and see how he made that.

Speaker 1:          04:08          I see that. I could see I, I'm, I think it's unfortunate and it may have been a mistake, but it might not have been a mistake. I, I'm, I'm, I'm still, I'm still, I'm not at all, not a look man. His job, his fucking way harder than mine a hundred times harder. Heard Herb Dean's job is to protect the fighters and to stop fights and to make calls. I don't want to be that guy that I thought that guy gets fucking hated on it. Never loved herb. Never gets low. And like no one ever gets love, but with more daughter don't be the guy tried to, John replied, he said, I always try to be respectful. We just call it like we see it too. But there's an arrogance with which you deal with the fighters, commentators and many in this sport. And I find it off putting, whoa.

Speaker 1:          04:47          One man's take. And I'm quite sure you'll give yours to for everyone to hear. Why not manic stone am Dan. I'm okay. So I believe John Eck referred to the inconsistent between each referees decisions of when to separate the fighters. And John said exactly. That's what I was referring to, that that two of the consensus, Beth best referees of the game would handle those two situations so differently. I understand the athletes are different, but there are parallels to be drawn. John is 100% correct. Hundred percent a hundred percent correct. And I'm at us, Bro. I'm, I'm, I'm, I feel bad that Mark Goddard responded the way he did because it's not very professional and I think it's very emotional and I think he's probably just feeling the heat. Yeah. Yeah. Hard on them. Yeah. You feel that heat and you get angry, you know. But uh, I liked Mark Goddard, a lack of Milan and I think he's a very good refereeing top one or two reps in the business.

Speaker 1:          05:39          I love mark daughter. He fucked that up. My question is I wonder who is telling them they should stand things up and when they shouldn't stand things up. I wonder if pressure he for pressure you feel from the audience you think the crowd maybe it could be that British people are very nice. You know sometimes an English people that man, when you got to worldclass wrestlers and this guy is impossible. Take down. He's one of the best of all time. Yup. Let it go. Let it go. Well I think let it go. Period. I just, I do not agree with standups cause I think of a guy can hold you down like this. What I was saying about Ben Astron if guy look, Ben asked her, you can hold you down and give you nuggies until the fight's over to something about it. Exactly. It's not cheating if he's not cheating, keep it up.

Speaker 1:          06:19          Do you know how hard is to control Woodley on the gown and the only outside fucking minutes you have five minutes to sink a choke in, five minutes to hold onto him and beat him up and uh, look, look, awkward it to this man. He didn't even fucking care. He gets to buck up, didn't complain where right back at them and took them down again and again. He's a monster and cool story, Bro. He is fucking hard to deal with man. For Colby, for everyone on the planet earth. But stylistically, when you look at the fight for Colby, I look at like Colby does well, yeah, he does that. He does that. The thing about loose man is he's got power. He's got striking, he's got wrestling, but even maybe more courtly Rto for days here. Oh, it's fine. Mine's a fucking bank fault. It's Fort Knox.

Speaker 1:          07:04          I'm so impressed. How adorable was it? Him and his little daughter. Oh Dude, I almost cried. Just such a bitch who I'm such a bitch pussy that I have kids. Me Too. Me Too. I'm like, I know. So cute. And just how happy mom and wife for real extra, they're like P diddy and a bad video extra. Hey man, he, he's so bad the world. Could you imagine what it feels like to have your husband when the fucking world world welterweight title to beat Tyron Woodley? No, I can't block out my wife. Take a hot bath. The fuck out of here. And my mom sure as fuck wouldn't be in the case. Hey Man. I feel like when someone wins like that, they can do whatever they want. Me. Carter's mom's always in the cage is dads. That's true.
