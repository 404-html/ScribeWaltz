Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. It's amazing how many Kim Kardashian clones exists now. I mean, and even in her own family, I don't know all the names of them, but one of the younger ones she, it's like she went to the plastic surgeon and she was like, I want to look like Kim, and they just give her the same face. What the fuck is up with them? The thing is the most disgusting thing where they're taking fat stuff and an into their ass and they developed this diaper, but I mean there's a lot of people out there with diaper button. I met a girl the other day that had diaper, but she was at the comedy store and I couldn't look away. I was like, what is happening to her? But because I knew it wasn't real. I knew she had. Okay, spindly legs. Yeah, the skinny legs and then the, well girl, if a girl has a big like hips and the right are art crumb comics.

Speaker 1:          00:46          Do you remember our chrome comics now our comments are chrome. There was a great documentary called crumb and it's about this guy who was just like really eccentric perverted cartoonist from the 1970s and he would always draw these women with these enormous legs and enormous, but, but they weren't fat. They were just voluptuous. They will know it was. You got to, it's past voluptuous into like super athlete DNA. Like if you could get that girl, make some male babies with it, you would have a fucking ultimate warrior like that. See that woman like they are perfect. How to have fun with a strong girl. And you see our chrome, that's actually him. Ronnie Coleman legs. Yeah. That's actually him with his boner. Cause he was as a really frail, Dorky guy. And he's got this image of this woman who just looks like a tank. She says he's giant muscle legs and, and big boobs, but not like ridiculous stripper boobs, but more like just Super Alpha Dna.

Speaker 1:          01:47          Female boobs. Yeah. He was a freaky guy. Like, look at him. He's got soccer. I mean that's, that's who he was. Like who they want above that, Jamie, the one to the right. Yeah, right. They're like, oh my goodness, is what he used to draw. He was always drawing this enormous, powerful women. This guy was definitely into getting dominated. Oh yeah. He would just shove his whole head and their pussy or something. Sure. Like look at him. He had him riding one. I guess he's supposed to be having sex with her and this guy definitely noted in like two seconds. Yeah. Oh man, look, he's choking them in these car. Like he's always choking them. Like you literally couldn't have an art crumb today that looks like it looks kind of like a woody Allen too. Oh yeah, sure. Yeah. Well see if you could find a video of him are crumb.

Speaker 1:          02:30          Uh, the documentary is fascinating because I think he wound up moving to France or something like that. I think you want to leaving America. Um, but there's, there's actually, if you go to video, you'll, you'll find there's video of him. But that was the guy. He's a really fascinating guy. That's not him. It looks just like him on the right. Not In the right. Oh, that's not definitely not the right guy. He wants him on the left. Does that him? Um, oh, there it is. Oh yeah. He just looks odd. It just cause you just holding up that picture and maybe it's also because I'm looking at him now as an older man. Um, the lot of the video that I'd seen was him. It bothers me to look at him and think like, that guy has a strong sex drive. Like, oh, that's the, yeah, he might not, he might just save it up for every couple of weeks and they draw one of those cartoons and beat off to it or find a cow suitable.

Speaker 1:          03:28          Exactly. Pay Somebody to sit on his face. A strange, strange character though. It doesn't matter Jamie. It's all good. What's up? I'll say it looks like he did Fritz the cat too. Yeah. Yeah, he did. Fritz the cat, he did a lot of a pretty famous, uh, uh, animated or cartoon comic book Type Things, but they were all at cartoonish features. Everybody was weird. Yeah. And you think Kim has now made that, that that's the no, but that standards, this is like a real, like that those women's acids that are crumb drew, I'm not justifying his stuff, but they were freak gene DNA specimen, like those women at giant thighs and giant acids and that's who they were. Whereas with Kim, she's got those spindly not, yeah, like her bud is this digital, it's a surgical creation. Like there's pictures of her that are online that make it look good, but they're all photo shopped.

Speaker 1:          04:20          And we found out about that because she got Paparazzi when she was in Mexico. They caught her on the beach and that was the one that they were showing right there on that way. It gets worse than that way. Grocer, they caught her wandering around the beach and they took photos of her, like real Paparazzi photos. She would have fake Paparazzi photos where she would hire Paparazzi, take photos of her, and then she would Photoshop a mob and they made it look like everything was in place. But it's not, yeah, it's, it's a disaster. This is what it really looks like. Yeah. Yeah. So is that it? Okay. So if the legs match the ass, I'd, I'd be totally fine with that. But even that acid is a distortion. There's so much going on there because you, you're not supposed to have that much fat in one place.

Speaker 1:          05:05          It was a girl has an ass like that has legs to match it. That's what I'm saying. If the legs match the ass, I like it. But the legs, the legs throw it off cause little, little twig legs and then you got the S. It's just not just a larger message. It's like those guys that shoot synthol until the muscles muscles, it's the same thing. Like you're not, that's not a real ass. Like I know they'll synthol muscles are not real moms there. So obviously fake, but yeah, cause the legs don't bend the legs mashed it. I'd be like, that's nice. Yeah. But it wouldn't match it. It's just not possible. And I've seen some where somewhere matches. Yeah, but not like that. It's just, it's the whole thing is a disaster. It's just, have you ever watched the poor guy, his face. He's like, I'm nailing this shit. Yeah, I got this shit on lock. Oh my God, this guy, he does. I mean, these guys wind up getting horrible infections too. Sometimes they've, they, well, this gang green and shit, they say that there's an actual thing. Oh my God. You say ha. You see, they say how there's an actual thing called bigorexia. Like there's Anorexia and there's bigger X. Body dysmorphia is exists with a, I mean, there's, there's people that have body dysmorphia in terms of their facial features. They just can't stop tweaking their nose.

Speaker 2:          06:28          Okay.
