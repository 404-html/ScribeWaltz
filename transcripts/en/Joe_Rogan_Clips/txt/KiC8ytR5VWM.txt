Speaker 1:          00:00          Metro Trump kept calling Jeb Bush low energy. I was laying on the couch and that's fucking me. He's talking about it. I'm laying on the couch and I hear about somebody dying in an avalanche and I watch it on TV and I laughed because I wouldn't have a fucking be dropped off in a helicopter at the top of a mountain to go snowboarding and then they die. I'm laughing my balls off eating a bag of chips. Well the one person, he's never called anybody anything is Nancy Pelosi. And people like, why hasn't he come up with a nickname for her yet? Yeah. You know, cause you can't say content that's going to cost him the election. That'll cost them 20, 27 said a joke about that. He's like, it's countdown until Trump 12 sick ankle talk face. That's what I call Hillary. I don't even call her. Uh, what, what kind of a nickname, if you were going to help him, like if he hired you like nick, hello, I need a solid republican comic to help me with my one liners. What do you think? Well, I call her on my show. I refer her to the, uh, uh, the leathery nippled. Hmm. That's too, too wordy. We need some pretty good look. Can we change our day like a lion ted? Okay. Yeah.

You know, she has fucking walls around our matching. Meanwhile, people laying their own feces in San Francisco. Well, that Laura Loomer chick, that chick did a handcuff yourself to Twitter. She hopped Nancy's fence and he started setting up, uh, like a migrant camp. Nancy's slot. Did you see that? What happened? What was the result? Illegal. She's doing something illegal. She's trespassing. I would say donagey I'll be outside of how it's gone. This fence is immoral, right? Build that wall or don't, I always think the wall still, but when we have the machine guns and tanks and flame throwers, like I cook them. You don't have to kill. I'm serious about this. You're going to laugh because you don't have to, but seriously, I love how we rule out lethal force as far as protecting our board. That's not even on the plate, so I, okay. It's too many. It was a pick somebody off as they're climbing event, but okay. You something less lethal. A supersoaker filled with cat piss.
