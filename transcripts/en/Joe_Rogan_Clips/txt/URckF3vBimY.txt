Speaker 1:          00:00          If we did end up in our bags was not to put a massive amount of effort into getting up, just play garden and stay safe because you know, the next round starts on the feet and tried to do damage there but it's still tiring and I, I, you know, kind of gets a hard time about as a, Yvette is cardio all the time, but who is, could be faced that didn't look like that after two rounds and winter I quit. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I was super impressed.

Speaker 2:          00:23          Ally Quinta in that fight. It especially considering he came into that fight looking for a third, a three round fight. I mean that was what he was trained for, right? He was trained for a three round fight and it changes up and all of a sudden he's in a five round fight for the title. Fucking crazy. Yeah. Crazy set of circumstances. But it almost makes you wonder, and this is maybe you could speak to this better than anybody, how much, how much is too much and in regard to training for a fight like this, like maybe training for a three round fight is the way to go when you have to fight a five round fight so you're not so fucking beat up. By the time you get to the fight, if you already know how to fight five rounds, you've already done it. If you're a guy like Conor was just got so much experience in the game, it might be that it's like there's a point of diminishing returns in terms of your strength and conditioning and that guys just go too far, pushed too hard and just don't have it when it comes to, I mean, how many times have you seen a fighter be overtrained when they fight?

Speaker 1:          01:25          Very often. Definitely. You know, they've, they've given their best rounds and the gym and it's very difficult as well. And those last two weeks, because anxiety is starting to grow. So you want to train harder, you'd want to get one more aspiring and you want to know because the flight's coming. And so it's almost like when you were back in school and you were cramming for an exam, the exam's tomorrow, I'm going to stay up all night studying. You know, it actually got me through college, so I worked so much. But, but in fighting we got to do, we've got to do the opposite. We don't have it. We've got to have a solid taper off period. And that is hard when you're dealing with a 20 something year old man and he's, he's dealing with what's, what's coming around the corner. So, but you know, that's, that's the trainer's job. You know. How much did he taper off for this fight? Uh, same as usual. We have about a two week taper off period where we start bringing it down. Um, he did that. He did actually spar even after that. Um, you know, we're, we were working very hard for this fight and the limit, you know, somewhat limited period of time. Um, so we did, didn't taper off quite the way we would normally do, but roughly two weeks if you want to do a rematch

Speaker 2:          02:27          and the UFC did grant agreement, this is obviously dependent upon how the Nevada state athletic commission handles the legal ramifications of him jumping out of the cage, attacking Dylan, Dan as the subsequent brawl, the chaos that ensued visas. You mean you're, you're dealing with a lot of legal shit, this fight that could hold things up. I mean, they held both guys

Speaker 1:          02:50          as person is correct. Uh, well the held a Habib's Conor got his. Okay. Conor goes press. So he gets his first and be, I mean, who the fuck knows what's going to happen with him, you know, and uh, yeah, I, I hope they're, they're lenient on them and I'm not just so we can get a rematch. I mean, I love watching him fight first. That, and I can, I can stretch myself to understand his reaction. I can stretch myself to under, I can't stretch myself to understand the order guys' reactions on what they did for him. He jumped over the cage and he jumps on. It's, it's not the end of the horse. The guy that jumped in there was wearing red. Who punched on her. Yeah. I'm not sure. I think that's the Xbox and coach, but I'm guessing he's a fighter. He fights for the UFC, uh, into red was done not an old, he wasn't older.

Speaker 1:          03:36          He actually worked with them. Oh, okay. You, there you go. Who is he? I don't know his name. Either. Islam or son. Yeah. Yeah. It was either his Llama style. I don't think it was either one of those guys. Like I know he's laughing guy. He was, you know, he hit done and a guy in a suit that heritage is Russian manager. He hit Dylan either way. Um, but actually indicates when your mind is went in and, and hit him from behind. Yeah. You know, I can't, I can't understand that. Like I said, for, for, for Habib, I didn't think it was, you know, it was, it's just, it's almost, it's such a foolish thing to do. [inaudible] to date already. One, I know that Dylan was talking shit and he was angry but like actually didn't say anything because I heard a few people signed up.

Speaker 1:          04:20          Now I was standing beside Dylan. I didn't see what he did but I could hear. So he didn't say anything now and I watched the back. I see any kind of beckoned them on, you know, just stupid end the fight stuff. But I didn't think it justified that level of response then maybe there was something else in the lead up. You know, probably dealing is a bit of a troll online. So uh, there was probably a bit of a build up of voter stuff. But um, yeah, like I said, it wasn't that big a deal to me. What have you did? Yeah, just really wasn't, well, there's two ways of looking at it

Speaker 2:          04:50          in terms of like the trash talking and one way is that man, does that sell a fight? I mean it sells a fight. Me Connors, one of the best ever at, if not the best ever at a talking shit to opponents, getting them riled up and me. It is the reason why Josie, although lost his composure and came charging faith first at Conner. I mean, you gotta think emotions play a big part of that. It ramps up your stress. It ramps up the fighters, a anxiety, anticipation and the ramps up, the pressure on them to win and to, and this emotion that they're fighting with fucks up their judgment. It just does. And it's a major tool that taner that Connor uses.

Speaker 1:          05:29          And, but on the other hand,

Speaker 2:          05:32          we'll say, well, I'd like when fighters are respectful and this is one of the things that could be saying this, this, this. Uh, sports should be about respect. You shouldn't be talking about someone's family shouldn't be talking about someone's religion. You shouldn't be talking about someone's country.

Speaker 1:          05:45          But you know, on the other hand,

Speaker 2:          05:49          that's one of the reasons why Conor is so fucking huge. It's not just as results, it's all the other things that come along with it. Is the excitement that he a shit talking though. Who the fuck is that guy? Like that kind of shit. That's a big part of who he is. It's a part of who he is as this cultural icon. I mean it's one of the reasons why people love them. I mean they don't just love his ability inside the octagon, which is quite substantial that they loved the swagger. They love when he comes in with rubber arms and, and struts around the cage. They love all that shit. They love all that shit. It's like when is too far? And that is the question. When is too far.

Speaker 1:          06:27          Yeah. Um, yeah, you know, Connor is a real ad divider. You know, if some people will love it and some people hate it, I'm not really that interested in people's opinions on things. I'm just interested in what is and what is that sells fights. There's a reason he's the highest paid guy. Um, so if that is what is, and that's just natural for him to do as well. It's not an act. It's not, you know, when he's sparring, I am an art. Them are best of friends on every single sparity. She's talking to her, your shit today. You know, you know what I'm forum today and they're gonna, you know, people listen to them like they hate each other and then speak smiles at the end of it. It's just part of the game for him. It's probably enjoys it. It's a bit of fun.

Speaker 1:          07:06          This one was dark or you know, as, as, as Dana said, it definitely was, but it's just part of who he is. I don't really involve myself in it. I tried to stay outside of that and then just focus on the task at hand. Ever get cringey for you because you are a very respectful guy. Yeah. I mean it's absolutely not my personality. It's absolutely not my personality. But again, I don't find my own opinions on things. Very interesting. I'm only interested in, um, what is, you know, there's a fact that he does this and it's got an, the results he has. Okay. Well, I guess that's what he does. It's not how I am. Right. I mean, you look at the two biggest names in combat sports, Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor and they both do it. Yeah. My favorite fighter back in the day was fate or, and it, there was a non that barely said anything and the purest if you want to say loved him, but he was also fighting mostly in Japan.

Speaker 1:          08:00          It's different vibe. It's a different culture than here. Um, you know, you could beat that guy. And I almost have the two extremes I've got to Nelson who you never hear a blip out of. Yes. And then I have Connor who was, you know, the other end of the scale. And um, you know, you can only be true to yourself, but at I look at their, their, you know, their followings and their sponsorship deals and their fight purses and stuff and it's obvious which one is doing better. You know, if, if, if the, if the, if we can agree on the object, the prize fighting is to make money and that's it. The object of martial arts I think is very different, but the object of prize fighting and don't ever lose sight of that. As soon as I hear a fighter saying it's for somewhere where reason, I'll try to make them retire as quick as possible because not being smart, you know, you're, you're taking damage for money and keep, keep that in mind no matter what your choices are.

Speaker 1:          08:48          Do you have guys in the gym that you see that sort of mimic Connor? Oh, of course. Of course. Yeah. You're, you're, you're dealing with teenagers and, and, and twenties and that's, you know, I look back at myself, it's a hugely impressionable, impressionable period of your life. You're, you're looking, you know, we see young men almost try out different personalities, you know, and he was such a strong personality in the gym. Definitely. I can, I can spot the 18 year old walking in with a man bun and the zoo telling me he's going to be the next year. I probably wouldn't be the same idea. It's not different. But I true, again, months and years of conversations, you know, not telling them what to do with conversations. I sort of say, this is, we've completely natural thing to do, but start to find your own voice and find your own way. And if that's who you are, you enjoy that side, but we'll run with it. If it's not who you were. Even that the fans will see true or very quick as well. You know, the fans can see when someone is genuinely doing something and doing it as, as, as an act.
