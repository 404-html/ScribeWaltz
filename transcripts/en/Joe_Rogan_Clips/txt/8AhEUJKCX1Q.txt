Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello Freak bitches. It doesn't get any better than this for boxing. Especially like after the Conor Mcgregor, Floyd Mayweather fight. This is a fight that like, hey, this is how it's done. Yeah, this is the real deal. I mean obviously Floyd did it how it's supposed to be done, but that wasn't two fighters on the same level. Look at this. This is crazy. These were absolutely glorious. It's fine. These are both great moments for boxing though. The Mayweather Mcgregor on this ship both really, really great for boxing. Brendan Schaub, I should say this before the decision gets announced, said that if Golovkin didn't win by some ungodly lopsided beat down, that he could lose a decision because of corruption. He goes, cause that's how boxing roles and there's way more money and Canelo winning. So that's sad. Now that we know that the cop tie sponsor, that's true. Well apparently the audiences are like half Mexican.

Speaker 1:          00:54          He's a superstar in Mexico. Just a super sweet talking about Canelo. Yeah, so let's see at Brendan Schaub predicted this correctly because we think it has to be Golovkin the rap, the unofficial scorecard guy had it for Golovkin by several rounds. We think it was go off can clearly, although canela fought a great fight, have there been bad decision if Canelo winds have there? What was the last time there was a decision like that? Tim Bradley, Manny Pacquiao who won that, I believe Bradley one, but pack, y'all should've won and then came back and outboxed him. It was worse. It was worse. If I remember correctly, I said, what was the reason? Look at that. Boom, boom, boom. Oh Jesus, they're shown hello. Oh my goodness. This is the last round that was Canelo just tried to put it to them and go off and he's like, come on, come on, come on. I'm from Kazakhstan bone. Just boom over the top. God Damn just war here. That had just paid back every punch he took in the combination. Just sharp jab to his gem. So snappy. Okay. Change it.

Speaker 1:          02:03          Give me a guess. Eddie Bravo for sure. Glove again, for sure. Right. Unless there's, unless there's corruption, like Brian says, he's not crazy to say that. I doubt it. They're cutting scenes, corruption pad. We're, we're saying this, look at this. They got it. One 16 one 12 for Golovkin. Harold led him in here. Harold, they gave that last. Lufkin ran away with it. They gave ten nine on that last fight. I mean that last round to fucking know Canelo yeah. You know what I really like? I don't know why they did that. I like how these girls just stand there and smile. They're doing really good job. They're always smiling. It seems easy, Dude. It's hard. You've got to be frozen and fucking clapping. It drives me crazy. I hate it. I love it. I love the f their focus. They're focused on not being even remotely normal.

Speaker 1:          02:48          This bird, the job, their focus, their job is to stand there, smile in Assam psychotic way. If they were a guy, like if they were a guy, if you were, if they hired a guy to stand there in a nice suit and tie and stand there like this, could you fucking imagine how crazy it would be if you hired guys to stand behind fighters with giant smiles on their face and just not, especially if they were in their underwear. Just imagine that. Imagine guys in a speedo standing there like ripped, like holding a [inaudible] sign with a big giant smile on their face that happens on Santa Monica Boulevard going, it doesn't happen during a big fight. Paper view. Eddie Bravo. You silly goose one day when, hey, let's hear the volume. Let's here it. Is this a split decision or no told you son. Oh boy. They fucking boxing. Fucking stinks. Told you son boxing shot. Apokyn is a sage. Brendan. Brendan Schaub as a safe fucking stinks. He mad cause he knows. He knows he got fucked. You know Canelo well he's going to feel terrible now. He knows he got his ass. That's a draw. There's no way. That's how is that a draw?

Speaker 2:          04:11          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:12          No, it's, hold on second.

Speaker 1:          04:16          He's actually going to see, if he was happy then that would mean that he thought he lost. So the fact that he looks pissed, that's smart. He's going shoot a one to eight [inaudible] 69 I think he's mad because he didn't win. He threw 200 more punches. Win. But he's definitely mad. Did he got outbox and they made it a draw to me. I did 50 more punches. Yeah. The fuck is that a draw to me stinks. It's not even close. Our punches different. No, there you go. That's the difference too. Maybe I'll go higher percentage. Oh, I can't stand it. Yeah, but it's a higher number. Landed two one 14 and one 10 and total power punches.

Speaker 1:          04:57          Yeah. Yeah. Uh, all right. Jab, weird thing though. When you're looking at it numbers wise, I mean it's one, it's one way or looking at it, but like one big shot that's a power punch and then another power punch. It doesn't do anything. They're both power punches. You know what I'm saying? Like one shot that really fucks you up and your legs go and you get wobbly. That's a power punch and another power punches his shot that lands in the same spot but doesn't do anything. They're both powerful. And these colors mean. What are the, what are you what I'm saying? What is the blue ear? Maine. I don't know. Look at the number of punches that, uh, landed on Canelo's face. Hundred nine on his right side and a 95 on his left to 10 landed two. One 27. Yeah. Big Difference in how many landed to the head getting 40 level and landed way more. He wait a minute, said only four shots were landed to Canelo's body. That doesn't make any sense. Does that word really when it said, I see what he says here. Let's hear this.

Speaker 2:          06:00          What happened tonight?

Speaker 1:          06:01          What happened tonight

Speaker 2:          06:03          today? Really big MACs. All my friends, romance,

Speaker 1:          06:13          good move. Go right to the Mexican fans. Fucking smart move

Speaker 2:          06:17          able to neutralize you. Especially early in the fight when it looked like you went starting to build the lead. I want to,

Speaker 1:          06:29          we probably can't play this without getting yanked off of a youtube, so we're going to go to the, first of all, I didn't think that last fight was a, I mean that last round was a ten nine Canelo no. How was he not fucking angry about this? I mean, why am I angry about it? Big Drama show tonight. He retains his belt, so nothing really changes for him and he gets all that money now that your record in the rematch is going to be insane. The rematch will be insane. Those dollars to 19 good job by Brendan Man. Fucking good call. Yeah, box. He filled it. The fighters were amazing, but the organization of it just stinks. Brendan. Nailed it. Can you hear this? Are you, are you guys hearing this? What? No. Okay. What am I hearing what he thought I wouldn't, you know, I don't want to hear. And here he's not saying I got really lucky that they gave me that draw. I don't want to hear what he's saying. If he thinks he wants to stupid. Still those a great fight. Amazing. I love it. I don't, you know, I mean, I do care, but I don't care. I do care. The thing that I thought the gun go off getting one, but I don't care. It's a great fight. I liked seeing great fights.
