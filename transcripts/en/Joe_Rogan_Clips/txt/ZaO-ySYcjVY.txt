Speaker 1:          00:00          Well, you got also realized Dj Dimitris just got shoulder surgery. So he's still rehabbing from that, you know, and who knows how long that's gonna take. I don't know how complex the shoulder surgery was, but yeah, that's, you know, still interested in that fight. I mean, it's a, it's a big one for, uh, for Demetrius. Jonathan especially, you know, he needs that extra little push over. You know how Shannon gave him some tips, some tricks when we were still in the media towards together for the talk shit. No, not necessarily to talk shit, but you know, cause he, he, he's not going to be able to come out and just talk shit. He's kind of style. It's not his style. It don't work, you know. Uh, but to round out his game a little bit, boy, let's say that, I know what you're saying because I, and I'm gonna go back to the most well rounded fighter.

Speaker 1:          00:46          You got to be able to promote to, you know, you've got to be able to see, people want to want to see you fight too. And that thing is a stress. It's a, it's a stressor on you and you're on your, you're training, like you said, you got to get up at 6:00 AM because when you do it, you get more media requests. So you get, you get to have those interviews more and that's a stress and it's something that you, Barron at your opponent don't necessarily have to, you know, a, a guy like Conor does a lot more media than, than his opponent though of course, it's a bigger stress and you know, if you can handle all those stresses and still go out there and compete, uh, then if you shy away from that, I got to take that away from you as far as being the best power fire fighter.

Speaker 1:          01:26          You know what I mean? That's interesting. But if it's not Demetrius, and who the fuck is it other than George and George isn't really fighting [inaudible] for sure. John Jones, you know, I think George's fighting right now either. Oh, you saying right, right now in the sport because John, I mean it's up there. I mean, I don't, I don't think John took PDDs and people give me a hard time about that. I don't think he did. I think he took something tainted just based on what you saw to has said about the levels pre and post test. I think you fucked up and us that money up man. Oh Man. I was fucked up money, but he could still, he could still come back and be much bigger. Uh, you know, like I say controversy, especially when you know, especially when you're black in America, controversy is, is, is one of the best things they can have until you really, well John, when he's loose and when, you know, like when him and Daniel were in that press conference and Janet was talking Shit, he goes, I beat you after I did cocaine with Josh just himself.

Speaker 1:          02:20          I mean, he's huge. He's, he's, he's, he's going to be the biggest, uh, he could already been the biggest star v cell from the beginning. If they don't really suspend him for very long, 100 comes back within a few months. It's entirely possible that he could come back and be the biggest still of all time. I think he's going to be way bigger. Uh, especially after, like I said, controversies is a great one. When you're black in America, they really is. It's not just that, it's like for John, like how much, how much more focus will there, I mean my fear is that he's going to s somehow now there's sabotage again and that, that this is not just this, that these lessons sinking in

Speaker 2:          03:00          because there's been so many of them. The car accident where the, you know, broke the lady's arm and she's pregnant and he runs away and then slamming the car into the tree. There was so many. And then there's, you know, the first test positive and then the second test, positive like fuck the brawl, the press conference. Fuck. It's like, there's so many things

Speaker 1:          03:21          I think that goes back to, you know, not being delusional and having the right team around you and somebody that you really listened to that you really truly listened to, you know, not just somebody that you just kind of hard. Right. Yeah. I hear you, uh, because it's easy to get that way. It really is. I'm sure, uh, like it have approached it a couple of times. You know, you get that, especially when you got that confidence in the thing that made you great in the first place. It can be like a hindrance to youtube. And I think a lot of it has been, or at least a lot of my growth and the past couple of months has been me getting in my own head and understanding it and, and kind of breaking it down. Uh.
