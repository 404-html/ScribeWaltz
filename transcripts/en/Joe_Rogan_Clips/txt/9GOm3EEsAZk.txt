Speaker 1:          02:09          That's the thing about La New York is just pound yourself into the ground until you get funny. That's kind of what the New York scene, the New York scene is like two 57 shows a day. Give up on your life. Don't speak to your family, they're losers are holding you back. Go hard. La is like, make a friend, have lunch, see what happens. I talked to some of the people out here and I'm like, what's the plan? I get nervous for them. I'm like, they're getting high. It's mid day. I'm like, okay, it's Wednesday too. They're like, we just had a meeting. I'm like, what you do? They go, we're talking about starting a podcast. I'm like, that's not a meeting. You're just friends with someone else. Yeah. You're talking about stuff that's not a meeting, but here's the thing. It does work here and there are people that I know who've made the right friend and then their life changes. Yeah, there's a little of that, but those people are super transparent and if you don't have any talent that's never going to tell, never work, and then everybody resents you. There's a few of those people that really don't have any talent, but they made the right friends and they cling on to folks and everybody gets real uncomfortable in that. Went off.
