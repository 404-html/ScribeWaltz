Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches believe what's on salon.com. Look, it's impossible to believe those things in good faith because you have to lie to make the, you have to lie so much to yourself and to others in order to make those arguments that I just, it is one long practical joke. That site, it is just a gigantic, it's the same time. I'm convinced it's funded by the Koch brothers to discredit a liberalism. I'm convinced, absolutely convinced. If you trace, if you trace the sell on money back far enough, you will discover, you will discover the surname coke because it is the only explanation for how badly sal on discredits progressivism is the only exposure just today they published another editorial from this fucking pedophile. Um, you know who I wrote about and he wouldn't even dare bring my name up because he's too scared to get into it with me cause he knows he lose.

Speaker 1:          00:45          I probably, you know, he published this thing about how, you know, I'm a Peter Farb, I don't act on it right after I'd exposed a pedophile, Sarah Nyberg in Gamer Gate, right. And it went all over the world. And it was a huge story that I broke the, hold on, I'm going to stop coming. I exposed this file, I expose this pedophile, you know, she was backed up and they double all the social justice warriors. Doubledown protected her. She was, you know, on message. Basically she had the right politics. So they stuck a kiddy fiddler. This is the state of the modern left directly after that with a coincidental timing salon publishes this thing by a pedophile saying, oh, well my pit of hell, but I don't act on it. Which is precisely the defense that this person's used. So I respond and I, you know, and I assume, and I did a, I did a very good piece of knowing I urge all of your listeners to seek it out because it really is excellent journalism.

Speaker 1:          01:30          Um, yeah, it was called something like, this is why the left. This is why liberals, this is why progressive's stick up for Peter Falls, explains why pdf files can get away with this stuff and why, why progressives and liberals back then, um, you think people back, pedophiles who backs poor, they're making excuses for them as they make excuses for them as San Juan, just today, today they gave us space to this guy who was a pedophile about whom there is horrific stuff online, which hasn't come out yet, which you know, you should watch this space for that. Cause I know Steven Crowder knows about some of it instead of why, um, excuse me. Uh, you should, you should just go, who wrote this? Did he get a second PA under his own name? This is how brazen now wrote a second piece for salon today playing the victim saying that he came out as a pdf file and he's been subjected to right wing hate so that he says this is the right [inaudible] I'm a creator fall and I, I think so.

Speaker 1:          02:24          I'm a pedophile and I don't act on it. And I did this like peace and everyone like came out and said that it was really supportive and it was really great and they tell people to get through their own experiences and everyone's really sympathetic except the right wing hate machine meaning me, whether he didn't dare mention me by name. Um, who are the white right wing hate machine, well apparent according to him. Um, you know, uh, exit the right wing hate machine had the temerity to say we think paedophilia his role and why you sell on giving a platform for it to this guy when there's so much dirt on the Internet suggesting that he is physically touched young girls for example. Um, you know, and I'm going to put yeah, there is a completely different argument. Well this is the thing, it's so long.

Speaker 1:          03:04          Gave a platform to this guy in San Juan ought to have known about this allegation. If you're going to, if you're going to make space on your platform for a self confessed pedophile and you will, you will only find this on the left. This is what I mean by the left. Sticking up for a bit of, I was there making excuses when they tried to legitimize them. They tried to give it, they tried to habilitate this as um, as an unfortunate sexual orientation rather than, you know, these people being dangerous predators that we need to be protected from. But I've never seen that. But you're saying it's all I've seen is where this guy's just discussing this. But no, honestly all bullshit aside, like psychologists and sociologists and neuroscientists have tried to figure out what it is that causes someone to have these desires. But we know from the transgender debate, the left doesn't care about that.

Speaker 1:          03:44          What it cares about is who can, you know who, where it can place people in the oppression Olympics and the victim hierarchy and pet. If I'm telling you I'm warning you now, that is the worry. I'm warning you now is that as the header files, pedophiles are going to be the next. Transgender has been one. Now they've won. They've won that battle. It's over. Um, do you think so? Yes, absolutely. Stay. It's done and dusted. We lost by we, I mean people who actually wanted to find out what the science said. Two is simply telling people lies born this way is a lie. And you know, because if you're a true story with some of them, nobody that's holding the signs because most of the ones holding the signs, the militant homosexuals are the ones that chose to be gay to get it. People uh, do, do you have like debates with gay people?

Speaker 1:          04:28          Well is willing to bait me because they know they'll lose. Well they've got woman brains. They're not very good at logic brains. I'm just kidding. You accuse me trolling earlier. So I thought I'd better get about 72 to live up to the reputation. Certainly do. And you're also very aware that uh, you, you are right wing views and the, those kind of a little bit of a right wing Ben to you. You talk about conservatives dress to wear a suit and tie this, this right from your suit tie. Like a good way to align yourself in the club is you have to espouse Christian values or talking about being Christian. Give us stuff about what the conservative establishment thinks of me. If I did, my career would have turned out very differently. I've, I, you know, I would have chosen a very different path through my professional life.

Speaker 1:          05:15          You know, I was at the Telegraph and it, you know, the most respectable establishment newspaper in England, uh, eight years ago if I'd want it to be, you know, a sign of the, of the conservative Republican establishment. I could've done that. I did the exact opposite. I've stuck my nose up and my middle finger up at the, at conservatives every available opportunity. I Bright Pour, pour Breitbart who put up with so much from me. You know, they published Black Dick Jokes every week for me. And that is a direct assault on the kind of stomach churn that the conservative writers or were said to have about gay things. Right. I don't just tell them I'm gay, I tell them I'm sucking Black Dick, right? I, you might seem really good column, very funny and entertaining and I'm right about everything. And that also puts them in a very interesting place where they can say, look, we have a gay guy working for us.

Speaker 1:          05:59          I tend to think probably about gives us stuff about whether people think that homophobic or not. They certainly wouldn't hire me. The second is do they call everybody? Buddy does trust me, trust me. Right, but doesn't care about, doesn't caffeine, you're homophobic, they're not, but they don't care if you do or they would. They care about is is the facts of what they published and the facts, what they probably should, but this was the time I see. It's so strange is someone who believes but doesn't practice. You believe in religion, but you don't practice any of the things that that religious bouses especially the sexual things, but it's the church brought out the book. You can buy it now, but it's like a, well now it got republished a few years ago by this guy named John Irvin and you, so you can get a hold of it now, but for the longest time used to have to buy it as a used book.

Speaker 1:          06:44          Well, I will look it up. Yeah. This one also, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Christian myth, he wrote a second one after the Catholic Church bought out. The first one stopped production of it and bought all the books. That's your people Catholics. I tried to hide that information. [inaudible] they last thing they want. I went to Catholic school, man for a whole year. Cured me. Fix me up. Good. It's where you get you a fine sense of right and wrong from no wait, let's not do that well, right and wrong as far as what is wrong with you now? I got lucky. They beat me a little bit. Lucky you didn't get that taste of no, I said just like I said earlier, if it went for Father Michael, I would have given far less good head. I mean it was a real father Michael, so much less. You know, he's, he's, he's going to get killed now, but who is Father Michael?

Speaker 1:          07:26          I betcha there's a real dude I should have made you suck his dick for real. Um, I make me, I was going to ask about it. I thought my English teacher too. But how old was he at the time? Um, oh, I didn't know he was quite young. Quite hot. Really? Yeah. And so that's where it all started with Father Michael. No, no. Is that post the tranny? Yeah, it was post. So it wasn't like, it wasn't drag queen as a child or anything like that. So, uh, it was quite a, you already had the five someone when like this is all wrong. I need to talk to father Michael. He's like, suck my Dick and shut the fuck up. And you're like religion as Aussie. I really, I really had no hope. Did I? I was, I was, I was never going to end well.

Speaker 1:          07:59          Well it seems like you kept stumbling in a decks on them through life. I don't know what would have happened if a heterosexual man I just been falling on Dix was in the same circumstances as you early on. I mean obviously things would have went very different. So I'm not sure if I buy the nop, you'd go down great. And the gay club go down. Well, I mean, you know, we have to push the expression. You go down. Well it ain't already match. Yeah. So good demo means you would a, you'd be popular, you go down to, well it would be like the way you would describe a meal or a drink. Oh, like it goes down. Well we like taking the piss. Yeah. It took me a while to get, what the hell do you want a cup of mind? Yeah. Which, which again is another thing.

Speaker 1:          08:42          Gay people seem disproportionately into, they're a peanut on each other. That seems to be the Lord only gay to be transgressive. They choose to be coming up prior in the gate. She used to be gay, to be naughty of all know sexual place. Pray the gale can't. Full belief Christian values count. Tear myself away on maybe as you get older and you know, drive dries up, I would've made a good priest. Do you think I'm making a good priest? I think a bit. Well you make a good priests. If you think the guy that made you suck his dick was a good priests. That kind of, he was a great priest. Honesty, like he was good. Other than that, I've never had a better senior tutor. He was great singing teacher got notes out of me. I didn't even know I could produce while he worked.

Speaker 1:          09:30          Your plumbing shattering, the Chandelier's kind of thing, but was he good outside of what he did? Like was he a good religious scholar? Was he a good parish priest? I mean, I just said fucking creep. Getting his dick suck. Then it's gonna to get lynched now. How's it going to get lynched? Does people, do people know who he is? I don't think so. What's his name? Well, I'm not saying any, well, I won't be at the time. You were a little kid and he was like, what? You're just trying, you're trying to, was he in his twenties or thirties it's another yet another feminist strategy that you have adopted in addition to your language buddy.

Speaker 1:          10:02          I told you it wasn't the pedophilia. I was [inaudible]. I was in my teens 14 I was in my teen. Something like something like that. That's what you said, your buddy. I don't know how they rocket and was very old England. I was in my teens. I'm here in my country and he's saying it right now. Maybe seen a 15 year old girl at any point in your life, however old you are, you've never seen a 15 year ago thought was off when I was 15 no dude, when you were 25 when you were 13 you will have seen girls about 15 you thought, whoa, whoa. No, you did a dental book going to be hot, but he didn't want a fucker. Bullshit. You can't tell me what I was born into. I think if you're 14 when you were born this way, you're born a Jew in it. Picker.

Speaker 1:          10:51          No, you're trying to make it so I'm a fucking creeper. Like you know I'm not, I'm not in the 14 year olds. How dare you sir. No, he's a 14 year old fucking the guy that you said it's a great guy. He was in a 14 year old stick. It's a terrible person. No, surely I was a very mature 14 year old. Yeah. Well in your case he got it right. You got the right guy to molest. It wasn't molestation. That's absolutely, most of the station is perfectly consensual. I don't think it is when they're 14 when I was 14 trust me, I was the predator. I was the Predator, the Predator chasing after the crease. It's to try to stay close to God. Everybody I was, I was aggressively seeking out sexual company of adults because I knew it would horrify people because I wanted sort of power over them. It was my way of rebelling, my way of rebelling. I was, I was the Predator of 14 let me tell you, do you think that's what's going on with that guy who directed x men? Bryan singer? Yeah. Much of 10 year old predators going after that. Poor man. I, I'm not sure it's the case with him.

Speaker 1:          11:51          That's a guy I, I lived Hollywood I a while ago. Did you meet briefly and you got one of his parties? I went to other people who I won't name of a similar stature in Hollywood. I went to their boat parties into their house parties and things and some of the things I have seen their baggage belief. Yeah. Can you give us like a, well, just, I can't, I don't want to be indiscreet about specific people because I think it's going to be around the fact, yeah, dangerous. But I can tell you the truth without dropping anyone in it. And some of the boys that were very young, very young, I don't necessarily recent, don't remember. No, no. Like, I don't know, eight years ago. Um, I don't, I don't remember, um, whether I ever met Bryan singer or whatever or even knew who he was then.

Speaker 1:          12:38          But I knew other people of similar stature, as I say. And there were some very young boys around at that time. There was a lot of drugs and a lot of tweaks, a lot of twinks taking drugs and having unsafe sex with older men. And some of these boys were very young, desperate for a job. You know, when Andy Cohen, the guy, Oh, what runs bravo had to apologize for the use of the word twink apologize for Twain. I thought that was one of the most adorable things. Yes. Gay as fuck. And he said the word twink and he had to apologize because what? Cause it was demeaning to somebody thought someone was like a perfect twink and he made like a social media comment. Nothing. Nothing's wrong with that. I got and you see this, this is the thing you see the progressive's are starting to police homosexual slang.

Speaker 1:          13:19          You know this theory, right? I'm, I believe that um, pedophilia is the next progressive rehabilitation drive. But I also think that straight, sorry that homosexual white guys are going to be put back into the establishment bucket very soon. If you look at some of the whining editorials coming out, I was like the daily beast, this female female columnist and the daily beast who will, who will publish things about seeing it on your Grindr profile, this app that you use to pick up guys nearby, which is best just to see if torsos and you just pick or you want to get the fuck by. It's correct. Jesus would've planned that. I don't feel like the iPhone and I don't use it for that reason, not for that reason. I think he is that it needs it. Um, but uh, on that, um, on the APP, some people say whites only.

Speaker 1:          14:06          Some people say only Hispanics. People just express their sexual preference. Everybody has a sexual preference. Perfectly reasonable. But of course, you know, there's some progressive column is just finally like five years later as cottoned onto this and decided to make a thing about it and said it's problematic that gay people express racial preferences in dating. Of course it isn't. We won't. The okay cupid data actually shows us which racism, which genders, um, you know, come out on top and come out of the bottoms like Asian women do very well, black woman right badly, um, you know, and the sort of league tables of, of, of hotness, uh, minimum. And Anyway, um, so the sign to police, the language now and the police, the sexuality of homosexuals, I mean, there was me thinking we were sliding dangerously close to tolerance and understanding. And now progressive's are starting to police the sexuality of homosexuals again.

Speaker 1:          14:49          Um, very interesting. There's a game of Gotcha though. So chemos. Gotcha. So it's, they don't really, they're not really upset that upset it should looking for something to complain about. Yes. But the problem with it, the problem that rich culture, I mean, I've always said that outrage culture is what it is. Right. Right. And the problem with, without any way to approach outrage culture, it was just what I do is to be outrageous, right. Say Ridiculous and outrageous things, um, simply to draw attention to the people, to get upset about it. Yeah. I think it's a very important project and it's what I do in a lot of my columns. That's what I do on Twitter. I've done a little bit today, um, and I think it's very important to wait a minute. You've done a little bit of it today. Well, I've been outrageous. I haven't said, and again, I believe, but I've been outrageous. Outrageous, outrageous, outrageous. Um, just a little bit, I've toned myself down for you because I know what a quick, you intersectional lump lumping Cree. Sure. It's so much threatened me. No.

Speaker 2:          15:52          Okay.
