Speaker 1:          00:00          I had fun though. You were having fun, it was weird, Oh, last night. Last night was fun. That sounds fun. Yeah, I had a good time. It's just a, it's a different feeling, but I think people are feeling differently about comedy now. Uh, because so many people are really politically correct outside of comedy and almost forced into it. Like you're hearing so many things about people getting fired from their jobs because of sexual harassment or from a sexually harassing joke. Like someone would say jokes in the office that were inappropriate so they got fired and this is happening left and right. You hear about the guy from Netflix that got fired for doing, he's having a conversation about offensive words that you shouldn't be using in comedy. And because of this, this conversation during this conversation about this subject, he used the word Nigger, right? Because he was in this conversation and did it one other time apparently because of that, not calling anybody to that saying it out loud.

Speaker 1:          01:00          It was fired from Netflix. That is crazy. Unless if he was saying it like he likes having a good time with, right. Like, he was like, you know, right now, like how was he saying? Was He, that's the thing, right? But the thing is, it's very strange that that word is only for bidden by the people that can't, it can't be used on, right. Like you can't use the n word on you, it won't work. But if you can use it on someone and they happened to be a person of color, then that person, you're not allowed to do that. Right. It's very interesting, man. Well, I remember when I would go, when I'd ride my bike to school, a lot of my black friends or get on my bike, you know, and they get on and I would ride them and it was fun, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:46          And they used to call me the Nigga bus whenever I rolled up and they would all call me that. And I honestly felt, and they were my friends. It was fun. Right. So, but you couldn't say it, you know, and I could, I couldn't say it. And also look, I find, you know, when somebody says anything, if it's something to do with a race, uh, gender, anything, and they have malice or ill intent and these days, I think if you do that, somebody's going to correct you really fucking quick. And so I agree. And in a bit, but in a business setting, man, and that type of setting, it's just, yeah, you, you make people so aware that they can't, I don't know. That's the fuck it is. It is crazy. But it's also, he was talking about forbidden words in, right? It's his business. But you're saying he can't make a sound with his mouth.

Speaker 1:          02:33          This is what you're saying. You're not, he's not calling someone that name. Right. He's using that word and people file complaints about him using that word so that people that he worked with ratted him out. Like he wasn't just allowed to say the word. Right. But the cra then, then it gets real crazy. Whereas if you're a black guy, you could say it all day and it's funny. Yeah. You could say it in front of white people and they can laugh. Right. But they can't say it, but they can't say, they can't say it. Yeah. But have you Chris Rock, you can go up with the orr tonight and just have like 15 different use of that word in a half hour set. Yeah. And No. And everyone's like, that was great. That was a great show. Right. But then, yeah, but then it'll be the same people that say we should never say or hear this word.

Speaker 1:          03:18          It's interesting. Some people learn it from different places, some people learn it from black people, some people learn it from white people and has a different feel, a different meaning to it. Well, and I was even talking with them, Mr. Peterson the other day, um, who I was saying, you know, the toughest thing I find is, especially coming from the area walk came from were, you know, there was a lot of racism was probably kind of went to, it was popular when I was young, but it was a part of the, it was part of the t of the cloth in the, in are in the area, you know, is poor, black and poor white. And you know, poor people like to fucking fight, as you know, it's cool. It's everything. It's like, yeah, it's like, hey, let's be on the same team for a minute. You know, and we can change the love that you have about white privilege. Oh, thanks, man. Hilarious bit. Thank, but did you.
