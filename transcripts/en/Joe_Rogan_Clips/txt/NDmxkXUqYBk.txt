Speaker 1:          00:00          What about CRISPR and what do you think, uh, is going to come out of that in terms of like real world application for an adult? I mean, what if people don't know what Crispr has? Please explain it in layman's terms. A, yeah, so CRISPR is a term actually was invented in, in my department, poly. So I know it pretty well. It's a back bacteria, have an immune system that cuts invaders, cut their DNA. Uh, and what we've done now as scientists, we've now utilize that a system, take it out of the back to you and we use it to create designer mutations, designer gene changes in animals and also in humans. So it's a bacterial immune system that corrects genes and we use it all the time. Now. It's, um, it's, it's actually what's interesting about us being able to mutate genes for many years. But this is dial up a gene mutation.

Speaker 1:          00:52          You can choose exactly where you want to make it. And, uh, so I think many of you listeners will know that recently, uh, late last year, Chinese researcher in our field came out and said he's engineered a couple of twin girls with CRISPR to be resistant to HIV AIDS virus. Wow. Um, if they're telling you that you got to think they're doing some stuff and not telling you about right, well yet have some kids with giant heads and well, it's coming through walls realigned. Well, yeah. If you start to see people, uh, that are 90 and uh, and they still as young as 20, you know, something's going on. Yeah. That's the weird one, right? If you can, you, you'd go, Hey, what are you doing? Nothing to Seton healthy looking good. Take care of bots. Right? They're not going to tell you. Yeah, yeah. Well, so consider this, that, that, so the chance of getting HIV in China is one in a thousand.

Speaker 1:          01:46          So that doctor was seemingly, he thought he was ethical, protecting the babies from something. That's, I would say really rare. Whereas if he really wanted to do something helpful to those kids and we agreed it was, it was something you should do, why not make them resistant to heart disease or the cancer? We can do that. It was weird that he chose HIV as the first test. Why do you think they did that? Um, I think because it was a very well understood mutation that would, if you've just destroyed the gene, it would work. Whereas with these other diseases, you have to be much more precise. But the reason that we scientists got really upset was that he did it in secrecy and then just low launched it on the world and that kind of thing because the, it's a fine line and ethics, you want to be doing that with total transparency running, I think he was hoping to become win a Nobel prize or be a star and it backfired on him because he, he just did it in secrecy.

Speaker 1:          02:44          It backfired in the scientific communities. Absolutely. In the, in the real world. In the media, I was shocked. Help little discussion there was, if this news came out in the two thousands during the Bush era, it would, there would have been panels, investigations that would have been in the news for months, but it wasn't, people went, Ahhh, what's next on Twitter do you think is just because the news cycles. So insane. I do. Yeah. Um, when you have a scientific experiment of that nature, what's the standard protocol for a scientist? Whether it is or is it the same in China and in Russia and the United States as a scientific community almost operate under different, like a different set of rules and anything else? You mean between countries? Yes. I mean, you know, like obviously technology is not shared. Like China is doing something technologically. The United States is, we have to speculate, we have to figure it out.

Speaker 1:          03:41          But when it comes to medical science, is it sort of an open book because everybody's sharing information? Uh, no, or at least, uh, alerting everyone to what they're working on or I know where you're going with this. Um, at least I think I do. Okay. Uh, yeah. So I advised governments around the world about what's going on under the radar as best I know. And there all countries, I'm not going to name them that are doing research under the radar and are preventing people like myself from entering those buildings to have a look what's going on. Yeah. So I'm sure that what's going on in there is actually a, a little bit broader than what we hear about, but I don't know how long is it before and I'll say Russia, no, I didn't say Russia. I didn't say anything. Uh, no country. I want to be able to travel freely.

Speaker 1:          04:31          Russia. Uh, but oh, I said it. But in, in, in countries where there are different standards, what's stopping a mothers who wants to prevent the child from having heart disease, which could kill their child, you know, 40% chance versus one in a thousand and eventually you could make a child that could live 200 years. Once we know how to do it, that could be the future. Um, there's always a concern that someone is doing something that is beneficial in one way, but negative in another way. And if everyone doesn't get to examine the research, um, it's very difficult. Like if we wanted to in the United States wanted to do something similar to what they're doing over there, we would want to have access to what they've learned. Right? Uh, we would, and so generally scientists share information, but there are companies that are government owned that are very secret.

Speaker 1:          05:27          Right? Um, and or even private organizations. And that's where it's a little tricky and that's why we, we scientists get really upset when companies or organizations don't share information, especially in something this critical and what's not really stated. But it's, my belief is that one of the reasons it was such a backlash against this CRISPR design, a baby experiment, and it really wasn't experiment. Um, it's not just that it was potentially dangerous and you could end up with kids that have deformities, but also that unless we do this in a, in a measured manner under supervision, there's, there could be a backlash like there was against stem cell research, uh, in the two thousands. We don't want that. Again, we want to be able to do this the right way this time. Right. Is it particularly if something goes wrong with those children, one person can ruin it for millions of patients.

Speaker 1:          06:18          The jump the gun and, yeah. So this we're, we're on the second generation of Crispr. Is that correct? Uh, terms of, uh, the editing tools, they've become more, they have that there's, there's surprisingly that there's lot of different bacteria that have the, these systems. So we're getting new ones all the time. Some that are more accurate because you don't want what we call off target effect. You don't want to accidentally me tight some Jane that's required for head development. Um, and so yeah, we're, I think in my department we were on fourth generation, fourth generation. Wow. Yeah. See I'm just going by a radio lab. Podcasts. Yeah. So my, my department's a fun, fun department today. And imagine they are in painting all sorts of stuff. What he, did you ever see the documentary Icarus? Oh yeah, it rings a bell. It's a Brian Fogle's documentary on, uh, the Russian doping program, state sponsored doping program and a Sochi the Sochi Olympics and how they have this incredibly complicated system of stealing the urine and putting it through a hole in the wall and putting fake year and back through it was really, really amazing, amazing, amazing documentary.

Speaker 1:          07:31          But uh, details, this incredibly complicated state sponsored doping system. I would imagine that with something like CRISPR or some various new forms of genetic editing, that that's one of the things that they're going to be looking into, that they're going to be looking into things that are going to enhance athletic performance. Yeah. I mean, you might need to have a DNA test to see if you've put one of these viruses in your mind, why you 50 and now you're running like a 20 year old, right. So that's all possible, you know? [inaudible] I also write reports for, for governments and one of the things that I predicted 15 within the next 15 years was CRISPR being used to engineer the human genome and make a baby. I didn't realize it was going to happen within one year. Wow. A lot of these technologies that I'm trying to predict happened way faster than even I think it can happen.

Speaker 1:          08:28          Do you think it's possibly happened in other circumstances that they're not going public with? Um, it's, it's always possible. Um, there may be some human clones running around right now that we don't know about. Do you think so? It's certainly doable. Scientifically. There might be some rogue nation who's doing it, but Barbara Streisand's togs, we're uh, we're pretty easy to clown. Yeah. The, she had her dogs cloned, right? Yeah. Yeah. Sammy, the 14 year old dog is now, there's two of them. Um, Jesus Christ, it is so weird. That'd be like, I'd be so scared. I go to sleep and wake up that thing. It'd be hovering over my face was red. Glowing eyes. Yeah. Wait till you have design it cemetery. A friend of mine, Carlos Bustamante at Stanford. We're entertaining the idea of making dogs live longer, uh, genetically. So why would you want your family member to only live 12 years?

Speaker 1:          09:19          I think about that man. My dog is only two and he's such a sweetie. You know, I'm sad that one day. I mean I had to put my other dog down recently and uh, who's 13 and he's just really, there was a massive two and he was struggling and I just think, man, this two year old, one day he's going to be in that same sort of situation. Well it isn't. And so we have three dogs. My wife runs a therapy dog and [inaudible] had her beloved dog. Samantha cloned that crazy bitch. Look at her two copies of it. One Dog, Jesus Christ. That's so strange. How about just get a new dog? You fucking nut. Ah, well so we might be nuts in my household because we're, we're giving our dogs and amen. Oh, and how's it doing? How old is the dog? What? The oldest dog is nine and he's still doing fine.

Speaker 1:          10:05          Does he look different? My wife says, so these are anecdotes. I'm not going to publish them, but uh, so Alice has a therapy dog and he has to go to hospitals and nursing homes. And if he has any men, according to my wife, uh, he can't be a therapy dog because he's too excited. He's running around, jumping around really? So that, that's anecdotal, but that seems to fit with what, uh, others have experienced too. Wow. Yeah. So what we're hoping to have some treatments for some pets are shortly one of the companies that I'm working with treatments for pets. Yeah. Well you gotta thank, Hey man, dogs aren't going to live 13 years anyway, you know? Well, yeah. And also we have a dog that has a kidney defect and the vets is only going to live five years, so she's three now. So that's the one, your experiment, what we experiment on, on, on all of them.

Speaker 1:          10:54          But, but what's the downside that's gotta be so uncomfortable for some people listening to this right now. Like, oh, I don't know how to feel about that. Right. What is the downside? If your dog has got a kidney defect and it's only going to probably live to be nine, meanwhile the dog's going to live to be a thousand years old. Well, we'll say, I'll come back and I'll, you know, in the Lotus position, meditating a hundred years from now, what do you do if it starts talking to you? That'd be great. Yeah. What? What do you do if you turn a dog into some new kind of thing that lives 30 or 40 years? What do you do? You tell people, like if your dog, like right now you're talking about on the podcast and a bunch of people are probably going to remember it, but a lot of people for yet, but if like 1520 years from now, your dog's still chasing balls and people are going to come over your house. Hey Dave, what the fuck's going on with your dog man? Right. Dot. That's Charlie. Yeah. How come Charlie doesn't have gray hair anymore? Man.
