Speaker 1:          00:00          What do you think happens with him? I don't know who can today. I don't know who can beat him. Who Do you think can beat him? That's a good question. I Dunno. Hillary can't, I'm so worried. Yeah, but I'm so worried she's going to run again and she's going to muscle her way to the top. I don't know who can beat him right now and I'm, I'm, I don't know. Why do you think that in the question, right? If things keep going further and further south, what about someone who was a centrist Democrat? Doesn't that make more sense that someone who's gonna, who's a rational person, who's on the right is going to look at this person who's maybe a economically conservative but socially liberal and say, this is really where I'm leaning towards the one on the far left and like on, on an identity politics platform, right.

Speaker 1:          00:45          It scares me. Yeah. That's not going to work. Well, it could it though, because I think so. I don't know. Because Trump's whole thing was, screw the center. I just need to make my base go ape shit crazy for me. But there's still apeshit crazy and no matter what he does and I'm worried that the left the Democrats are going to try and replicate that strategy and be like, we just need to make our base go ape shit crazy rather than running someone that can win the center. I see where you're going, but I think that this is maybe my liberal bias, but I think that people on the left wouldn't fall for that. The same way people on the right would, I don't think people on the left who saw someone who went ape shit full woke far left. I think there's a lot of people in the center and be like, well I'm going to just get a vote, libertarian man. I'm going to vote for Gary Johnson or some shit. But okay, so who's in right now? So we have Kamala Kirsten Gillibrand months dress monster ts ideas. Well, when she was 22 she had, oh she isn't a solid toady. What does that mean? She is a toady. I think that I use that word correctly. Jamie, can you check with toady means like towing the line? Is that what it means? No, I think it's like a

Speaker 1:          01:55          t o a d I. E was, I mean,

Speaker 2:          02:00          okay.

Speaker 1:          02:01          I think it means that. I think it means

Speaker 2:          02:03          there you go.

Speaker 1:          02:06          Toady definition of toadies, a person confess flowers or defers to others. Can they kind of self serving reasons I stick a fan. So she's an Assad sick offense. Is that what you're saying? Yeah, that's, that's

Speaker 2:          02:20          okay.

Speaker 1:          02:21          Known about her. Like what did she say that, oh, we have to look. I don't, I don't remember the details. I probably should say that before we say that about, or we should probably read it rather well. I have read it. Not many. Maybe we should, right? Oh yeah. Okay. Just so we know what she said. I've had her on Gab or really enjoy talking to her. I like her a lot. Are you serious? Yeah. Like talking to her. A lot of talking to her. I don't know about, I think she's like the mother lode of bad ideas. Whoa. I'm pretty positive about that. Especially on the side. But maybe I'm wrong. I don't think I'm wrong. Well, my take on her was that I think as a person who's coming from the left, who's also a veteran and uh, it's very articulate and sensible and a woman, and in talking to her, and we didn't get into a sod or any of those things, but talking to her about what she feels is wrong with the current administration and the way things are running in a direction she thinks things could go in.

Speaker 1:          03:17          She has a very promising ideas. I don't, I didn't know about it. It doesn't, she also, did she ever apologize for believing in conversion therapy for, I didn't even know she believed in conversion therapy. Am I crazy? Is that real? I'm almost positive this is real. I think her father ran con. When you say conversion therapy, you're talking about gay people. Yeah. No, I didn't know that. I never heard that. And I did hear something about when she was very young, she was like 22. She had said something about gay marriage and civil unions. If she apologized for and said that she evolved, she reveals she met Assad in Syria without informing top Democrats. Yeah. She's, she said she went on a fact finding mission in supportive piece for Syrian people, but characterize us backed rebels' as terrorists.

Speaker 3:          04:03          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:04          Yeah. She's,

Speaker 3:          04:07          I mean,

Speaker 1:          04:09          I can keep looking, but I just, I'm telling you the time to research everything all at the same time. I can come back on when I do. Well, let's, let's, we can do this another time. Okay. But what, who do you think stands out for you as someone that would make a good president? Yeah. She wants touted working for an anti gay group that, that conversion therapy. Anyway, she wants touted working for an anti, she worked for an anti gay group. She worked for them, like she had a job there. You know, I'm worried as a person who's been called. All right. Uh, Jason, I'm just looking at about labels. No, I understand. But you know what I mean? Rep Tulsi Galbard in the early two thousands touted working for her father's anti gay organization, which mobilized to pass a measure against same sex marriage in Hawaii and perverted and promoted controversial conversion therapy. Yeah. FYI.
