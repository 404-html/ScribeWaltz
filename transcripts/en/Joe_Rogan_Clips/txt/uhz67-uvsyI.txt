Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. You know, it's funny. In 1985 I lived in a building in Fort Lee and there was a Panamanian woman and she told me that she went to Cuba twice as a young girl and she wasn't surprised what was going on in Cuba. That was God's punishment. She goes, it was such a disgusting fucking place. And then it was weird. A couple of days after, I'm talking to Tj, uh, somebody on Facebook. I did a joke from my CSO special about club 38 the owner name was Willie Vandy. And his claim to fame was that his grandfather had the biggest dick in Cuba. I grew up with two kids that had a claim to fame. One of them, his dad was the best pool player in Cuba and Americans will go down and he'd beat the fuck out of him and pull you, but they played Chicago eight ball when I'm in Chicago.

Speaker 1:          00:52          The other guy, his claim to fame was that his grandfather was the guy in godfather two who had the big Dick and they called him superman and Saturday nights at club 38 in union city, he would on Saturdays he recreated and he's had people come down and it'd be like a comedy show, $10 ticket and 200 people. He would get some coke out, chick tire up to Cubans like that would play the congress and he'd come out and fuck the lady in public, just go crazy with the biggest dick in the world and my job fucker and public. That was a whole thing. That was the whole thing. That was a public fuck show, but it went all the way back to Cuba to like 55 like the name of the place was the Shanghai, the Shanghai Theater and and then then godfather to Michael takes, they take Michael there and all of a sudden he goes, I would have never found this place if it wasn't for Johnny Ola and that's when Michael finds out that he betrayed them so they don't show the guys pick.

Speaker 1:          01:51          Then simpler if the guy with the big Dick was also the greatest pool player because he could just, Oh my God. Yeah, that would have been perfect. So they did this article about two weeks ago. It's on my Facebook and it's called in search of Superman, Joe Rogan. It was the most disgusting article I had ever read in my life that these white dudes went on a 50 year looking for superman and the legend of the guy with the big thick. In fact, do val went to Cuba to the location, even though it's close, just to see where it was and what the story is that us as Americans will go down there every week and that was our first time to see this big black Cuban dude. Fuck the shit out of some poor white chick, you know, yelling and screaming. The place was sold out every night. I mean, the guy was a gardener. The article is sensational, or if you could find it, it's called in search. You're superman and they is it there? The Superman of a vagina. But when it came out the same week that they said that, what are you fucking crazy? They ain't no fake. That's real. That's why they call him superman. Afraid know. I saw, I saw

Speaker 2:          03:00          a video of Superman when I was researching Havana Nocturne. I found out that Santo traffic content had a lawyer named Sam Rogano since deceased, but Sam Ogana used to take a lot of super eight videos when he'd go down to Cuba. His son, who's currently a a lawyer in Tampa told me that he had super eight footage of superman that his father had made in the 50s superman at a private sex show. Fucking a girl. And I said, Ooh, I got to see that. Could I see that? I mean, I think that's the only existing video footage anywhere of Superman. And he said, yeah, but I'm not going to give it up. You got to come to Tampa and I'll show it for you. So I go down there, I'll never forget, he's a lawyer too. He says he got to come at six o'clock after the, after the office closes.

Speaker 2:          03:49          So then we can watch it. And I get there and the cleaning lady still there, so he brings me into a conference room where he's going to show me the film and we got to sit there and wait until the cleaning lady's done because he didn't want to put this film on while the Clinton, while the cleaning ladies in the room, so he puts it on the plates to office is completely empty and he shows me this footage and his father had scored it to like Wagner or Beethoven like triumph and classical music and it's, it's at a private show. It's in somebody's home. They had private sex salons in Havana where you'd go to like some rich person's house, you'd pay some money, you had cocktails and then someone had clap at a certain time and you knew that was time for the show and everyone would sit down and superman would come out and he, he, he fucked this. A Cuban woman who was, who was small, he was big and she was small and he's banging her from every conceivable angle. It was the least sexy thing you've ever seen in your life. I mean, it looked like a, it looked like some kind of torture really. Uh, and that was it. And this guy had this footage, which is probably worth a lot of models. Big was the Dick. The Dick was big.

Speaker 2:          05:05          It wasn't, no, I say that because it wasn't like I wasn't the, I'm not sure it was even the biggest stick I've ever seen. I mean it was bigger than my dad's bigger than normal. It was bigger than the guys today. It's almost like athletes. Like if you go back and look at, you know, when Jim Brown was playing football, he was very impressive. But was he Herschel Walker? You know what I'm saying? Like athletes of today's era or different, and if you go back and look at John Holmes, yeah, he had a big Dick, but was it Lexington steel? You know, like these guys have bigger dicks now, but the people are that they're board vex people are growing. The thing that freaked me out of the human feces is advancing dancing. But then that frequent about Santo that I enjoyed from your first book of analog turn.

Speaker 2:          05:49          And I wanted to tell Joe the stories that one time Kelly went to cash, uh, Cuba as a senator and they were having type of meeting but fucking Kennedy can focus bro. He just like it and that they like, what the fuck is wrong with Monsanto traffic camping because I know exactly what's wrong. Come on. And they tapped him on the shoulder and they bring them in the room. He's embellishing this. Tell me, this is what I remember. This is better. This is what I remember I read. And that I guess sat though, he's sick them on two women candidate while he set up. He said, no, they didn't film it. They wish, they wish they had filmed that. They said they set him up in a room when the two way mirror and they watched it happening. And then one of them said, Shit, we should've filmed this.

Speaker 2:          06:35          This would make great blackmail material. Right. Well, like Santo was kind of a freak. So JFK cheers. The freakiest the freaks, right? Yeah. Well, but you got to keep in mind he wasn't married. He was a young senator. He used to get this senator from Florida named George Smathers and the two of them would go down to Havana. And this was around 1955 56 when the whole thing was in its hay day. And that was a big part of a van of politicians and businessmen would go on junkets to Havana, like you know, paid for by the company. Weekend Retreat, go to Havana, and they'd go to the Shanghai theater and they had tris sexual triste and they'd go crazy. And it was out of sight, out of mind. It was the original, you know what happens in Havana, stays in a van. It was all different country wasn't going to make the newspapers. So they go there and they rub elbows with Santo traffic contact in Meyer Lansky and they loved it. It was exciting. It wouldn't, it wouldn't do them any damage back home. You know?

Speaker 1:          07:37          Amazing. When my mother died in [inaudible] 79 and whenever I did something, like if I call my head differently or if I wore like a, an orange shirt, my mom would go, what are you fucking rock Hudson? And I go, what the fuck are you talking about? Rock Hudson, you know, and then one day I asked like, why do you always call me and rock cuts him? And she goes, cause rock Hudson, I don't money go. And I go, what the fuck are you talking about? She told me she died in [inaudible] 79 my mom told me in 1978 flat out to my face that fucking he was gay as could be. And I'm like, you don't want, I've heard I'm sick and tired of you fucking Cubans. Because Cubans, like they used to tell me when I was a kid that they smacked Bruce Lee and Cuba one time that he went down there and talking to shit.

Speaker 1:          08:21          And one of my uncles smack them in the face that, you know, Cubans will lie to you just to fucking fuck with you. So I thought my mother was fucking with me. She's like a rock concert. Is this gay? Here's a $3 bill. And I go, what the fuck are you talking about? She goes, let me do what I'm talking about. Right when I was a little girl, rock cuts and would come to Cuba and we would all go to the hotel. You like when Michael Jackson goes to a hotel, come outside and they clap. He shook the kid outside the window. We would be out there like waiting to see rock cuts, but the hotel guy would tell us he was up there in a room with a man and I would go, Ma, are you fucking crazy? Like I didn't believe her. My mother died in [inaudible] 79 85 rock Hudson comes on and says he's gay.

Speaker 1:          09:00          Like Campbell was just a hiding place for people that want your mother know that the Marlon Brando was fucking Richard Pryor. No one time found out from this article, if we were to scroll down a little bit, it says it, that they asked his neighbors and the neighbors were like, no, he was bisexual. And then when his number one guy that was known every time he came to Cuba was Marlon Brando, he was Marlon Brando would walking there with to show girls and then him and fucking superman would leave by themselves. So while Brando loved the music, they play Congos all that shit. He was really into it. Well, Pryor's wife was saying that back then, they were doing so much coke did. Everybody just fucked everybody. Everybody. That's just so crazy. He couldn't make Jagger. Fuck somebody like David Garrison. That was one of Mick Jagger. His wife said she caught David Bowie and bed with Mick Jagger.

Speaker 1:          09:52          I know a lot of coke, but I never wanted to fuck you up the ass Joe Rogan. You know what I'm saying? Like I never, I did a lot of coke. I never want to fuck another guy in the story. Brando who was bisexual took off with superman, ditching the dancers. So Superman was a bisexual too. In fact, I heard he had died of gangrene. Gangrene. Yeah. And here it says that he infected. Yeah. He died with a lover from sex. Oh, he slept around but gangrene from Sachs. How hard you got to fuck to get gang green maybe. Fuck this chick that got shot in the ass. He might've fucked animals. Yeah. Wow. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Was getting dirty, Bro. Cuba was dirty. It was dirty.

Speaker 3:          10:43          Okay.
