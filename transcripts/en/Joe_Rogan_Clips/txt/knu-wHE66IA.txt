Speaker 1:          00:00          Her low freak bitches though. It's hilarious. Everybody is on steroids. What a great picture. So hilarious. They might be right. Yeah, they might be right. You know what I started watching last night, I don't know if you'd say it [inaudible] or [inaudible] is on Netflix. It's all about doping and this uh, this guy who was helping the Russian team on Russians, there was one estimate that it was somewhere in the high nineties of Russian athletes are on performance enhancing drugs. That makes sense. That's my thing with this whole Jon Jones stuff and like I go back and forth, I'm going to quote our friend Eddie Bravo when you look into it, when you look into it that try Nepal, like so many guys article came out today, I think I'm Fox Fox sports are came out today of this guy who was a minor league baseball player and he's a pro now and he's tested twice for a positive and a third time and he's waiting to see if he gets banned for life because three strikes, you're out in baseball fan for life and they're saying the how many guys in baseball test hot for this Toronto Ball?

Speaker 1:          01:07          And they say in Gnc they have 47 products at GNC that this can show up us. Wow. I know. So I saw that. My God, fuck yeah, but wait a minute, he's not supposed to be taking anything. You're talking about a guy who was already lost his ability to make a living from Mexican Dick Pills. Like why would he ever just take something off the shelf at Gnc? Well, we're, we're not giving the Guy Kudos because he's the smartest tool in the shed. Short, sharp, what I say, smartest tool in the shed. Well, tools are smart too. I smoked a little weed.

Speaker 1:          01:40          You don't have to say, he might've been like, oh, I need energy. Get me this. What is that bolt out of his neck? And he takes that dude. The truth is I would never do steroids. I put that on my children. I put that on my heavenly father. He did not bring heavenly father, loved how he capitalized heavenly and father cause uh, for sure do spect while re you know, and get to hell has Spec Hispanic, um, thirties facing up man. Imagine if he comes back at 34 and still fucks everybody. But he's 260 pounds at heavyweight just merged. Fuck all this cutting weight. Just just go on a power lift and rampage for the next four years. Keep your body in shape. It's still fuck everybody up at heavyweight. But if you look at that trend of ball man, and you see how much, how many guys test hot for it.

Speaker 1:          02:27          And they're like, what? Dumb fuck, it's not in there. I can see Jones argument a little bit. Yeah, I know. I go back and forth and I'm off the Jones Stream, but when I see that and I see how big of an issue it is in baseball and minor league baseball, you Sada in the commission might be like, fuck, look at all these guys, man, we've got real issue here. Maybe he did fucked up so then I think there's no way they give them four years, but I asked, they're going to realize I haven't heard of anybody else tested positive for the stuff in the UFC of you. Is it the same stuff, Frank Mir test positive for you? This is other thing. Usually if a guy tests hot for something out of one of those major camps, other guys can test hot for the same stuff and last he's getting it straight from the power lifter guys.

Speaker 1:          03:09          Yeah, hours. NFL brothers didn't Frank Mir eat kangaroo. Those is like tainted kangaroo meat. Bro was at the worst argument efforts. The worst ever because people don't even eat kangaroos. Smart Guy. He's the smartest tool in the shed. Some people eat kangaroo, but it's not common table fair in Australia. Fuck No. I was just in Australia doing shows them how to eat kangaroo burger. No, fuck no. They eat venison. Beef eating cake. Yeah, but couldn't say what he was flagged for. My favorite part, however, he was still given a maximum punishment by, you saw the, I think as he claims he listed numerous potential sources for the positive test including eating kangaroo meat while in Australia. You saw it as like what out of here? That's the best you got. We've heard a bunch of shit, but that's all you got, boy. You know what's interesting? It's like how much does it help?

Speaker 1:          04:06          How much? Like what? Think about like what these guys are doing. I mean definitely steroids help right to steroids make you a better athlete. They allow you to recover, let's say 10% better. Yeah. It's hard to tell though because could John beat Daniel Cormay without that small dosage of Terenna Ball? Yes, he could do. That's what DC was saying. He was like, the guy doesn't need to do it. He's super talented. Does it need to do it? I know that's why when you look at the evidence and like why this small amount of travel ball and you see all the other guys testing pause for it, how much would this really helped him when he risked all this to take something piss hot and it's really not helping that much. And then where do we stop? So right now we want to enlist and I've been the fucking poster boy of making fun of John on this stuff.

Speaker 1:          04:58          But in all seriousness, we're do. We'd say, all right, most guys are doing it. Cause that there was this a heard Luke Thomas talking about it. Uh, they uh, uh, water right? Will sat in water. Yeah, water is the big one. I think. Uh, in 2007, they did this survey of athletes including fires that were going overseas and competing and they, they ask them as at a kind of under the radar how many guys are doing performance enhancing drugs. It was an alarming number. Like 78%. And that's people, you know. I bet it would be a little higher than that. Yeah. So like, you know what I'm saying? So we're, we're going to tarnish John's name and he's not the greatest of all time, but it's like, okay, but then you'll pay to watch over him fight. You'll pay to watch Vitor Belfort fight. You know, like we don't know exactly who's doing what.

Speaker 1:          05:46          Right. But if Overeem becomes a champ, I guarantee you if he pisses hot as a champ, people turned on him too. No, I get it. But he, he's, he's tested for way worse things than John has, but he hasn't, he, we tested testosterone, right, didn't he? It was just testosterone. Oh my God, I got an elevated testosterone levels pain. I mean the same shit. Remember when he was Uber Rheem? That's more than just tossed around. But he, but he tested positive for that, didn't he? And he said a doctor gave him a shot. Wasn't that like the whole deal at some doctor or shoulder at for, I know there's no, I don't, but let's just think about what they are like. So he tested positive for testosterone, I believe. Well, if you test positive for that, and if you had an exemption, that means his levels were on that feet doorbell coordinate mark cart shit where they test, you're like, holy fuck man.
