Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience from that show and then straight into hard to kill the show for the discovery channel from going then deployed to Africa like this year. I don't even know. I can't even, how does that all work while you're still serving? Like how do you get the freedom to do all these different things when you read after you reenlisted. So the army will always get with the army once, um, first of all, but it's got to help them having you be so high profile tentative of the military. If you're listening right now, go to your local recruiter. That's why. But seriously, we are having special forces specifically we are, we are going to have the biggest deficit of eligible up a pool, a population to select from because you have to have a certain level of intelligence search, certain level of physicality just to be eligible for special forces to pick from you.

Speaker 1:          00:52          That pool is the smallest that has ever been in history. Why kids are playing video games. They're not eating Cheetos, they're less participation in sports. I mean, if you could just go to a high school, it'll look at a high school are now compared to 20 years ago. It's a different thing. Really. Yeah. We, we, we weren't like barely getting kids past obesity 20 years ago. Now in a high school, if you walk into a classroom, half the kids are obese. So you think this is just because they're sedentary because of playing video games and fucking around online all day. It's not just, it's not me thinking this is us. Absolutely quantifiably saying we do not have enough people to to pick from. Right. And that would be one of the best ways to really find out what the actual average health of viable males is.

Speaker 1:          01:44          Right? Yeah, for sure. There's always going to be the best of the best that want to test themselves. I mean, this is just always how it's been. So we teach hundreds of courses. We only have that hundred, we only get six or eight, but that's a hundred people that go to special forces selection. That hundred that goes, they have to have a GT score. They have to, they have to have a scores high enough on the military entrance exams just to be eligible. They have to have a PT score high enough just to be eligible so we can't even get that hundred and then of that hundred only eight or the eight of them are making it. So we're, we're, this is, to answer your question, how I'm able to do these things is I'm in a position where I can say for the love of God, please get healthy.

Speaker 1:          02:28          Please walk to your recruiter's office and please take a test to see if you're eligible. Because we are just needing people like we've never needed them before. Jesus Christ. It's scary. Wow. Well that's one of the best indications. I mean most people don't know, like people like me, I'm 50 year old father taxpayer out there do much. I'm not paying attention to what fucking high school kids looking at it. I know. I've no idea. Yeah, I do go to like a marine recruiter right now and be like, hey bro, how's your job right now? And there's a fight him from taking that pen and stabbing it into his eye because he just can't get somebody that isn't smoking weed. Somebody that can pass a PT test, somebody that can pass the tape test and it's somebody that can past what's a tape test. I'm like, they're not.

Speaker 1:          03:12          So we measure their neck and their waist and they can't even pass that so that too fat. The two fat has the neck too little or too big. Um, so if you have a big neck, right, and a big waste, this is, um, cause like I have a big neck. Right, but it's from working. Yeah. Yeah. But I have a tiny little waist, so that gives me my BMI and my body fat. You know, they measure, it's, it's a pretty, it's, it's a gross measurement, height, weight and measurement. Right. And the other, there's only like four things that we need for some, for us to say. Yeah. It's harder to get into military than it is to get in college. That's, that's absolutely true. Not Regular military, but special forest. So regular military. Yeah. Really? Yes. It is not easy. And then from that we only pick combat arms and then, oh, that combat arms, we only picked the top hundreds.

Speaker 1:          04:01          It harder for someone to get it to the military than it is to get into college. I thought it was fairly easy to get into the military. I'm pretty sure anybody can go to college. Anybody. Well, you can go to community college. That's college, right? Yeah. Um, I'm not saying it's as easy to get into MIT. Right. But anybody can go to, some calls can go to any college that they want, not any, any color they can get in, they can go to, you know, local community college and then two years there they can go and get into the next unit. You know, like the state you school and then from there they can get a right. I mean, anybody can do that, right? Well, you can't go to the military, be smoke weed. You can't go to the military if you have bad eyes, you can't go to the military.

Speaker 1:          04:42          If you're diabetic, you can't go to the military. If you have asthma, you can't go. You can do, you can go to college if you have all those things right. You know, you, you can't go into the military if your Iq is x number, depending on your job, well, you can still go to college. You can't go in the military if you can't run a mile or two miles in this speed and do this number of pushups and this many of sit ups. I don't think any college has that requirement. So I'm just in those seven things alone. We just cry. We just exed out 80% of our population. And do you have, is there also a problem with people's attitude towards the military, um, with young people? Yeah, a little bit, but that, that, that is mostly a physical issue that is way less of an issue. The perception of military is way less of an issue than us just having a qualified population of viable candidates for us to pick from. I mean, it's really bad where we're, we're freaking, we were, we were borderline freaking out about what we're gonna do. So an average special forces the ODA, um, has I supposed to have 12 guys in it? Right. Um, right now you're not going to find a team that has more than 10 and,

Speaker 2:          05:49          okay.

Speaker 1:          05:49          We only have 70% of our teams with 10.

Speaker 2:          05:55          Yes.

Speaker 1:          05:55          Yeah. Thank God we didn't go to war with North Korea if they got at war ended and that we're not dropping nuclear bombs on anybody because we're in, we're in a hurt locker for qualified to have no idea about this. No, it's scary. Wow. So this is my part of that. One of the best ways to measure what's wrong with the way people are living today. Yeah. I mean, forget about whether or not they want to go and serve the, the, the viable quality candidates like this. A number of them that are even available is the lowest it's ever been. Well, what about high school athletics? I mean, have they decreased, finished? Yeah. Really? Yup. The same rate. The party, very, very similar. Um, the participation and not so you can go and play, um, for your,

Speaker 1:          06:50          the rec time volleyball. But to get onto the the varsity football team or the varsity volleyball team or the varsity track team, the number of people in percentage to the, so if you have a thousand people, you had a hundred of them that were picked to participate in those athletics. All right. Should we at 10%, that number now is down to like five or 6%. So the, the overall percentage per capita of number of people participating in these sports has been consistently decreasing for the past 20 years. Wow. 20 years in 20 years is essentially when the Internet became a huge thing. Yeah. I mean, that's basically the same timeline you're looking at like 94 99 you see obesity going like this. Yeah. Wow.

Speaker 1:          07:38          You got bad food. We got to opt to, our jobs are getting less and less physical. The, the focus on what jobs people should have. Everybody's been like, I'll go to college and you're like, become an academic so you can be this intellectual that can go and do this job. And then you graduated from college with a student loan and you have no job to go to. Um, where there's this guy that needs welders, but it's not cool to be a water, so don't, don't do that. Or to be a mechanic, like all these trade jobs that are just begging and pleading for and they are sometimes physical, but they need people. But it's not core to do that because, you know, like I want to go to and we'll go to long beach state or I want to go to UCLA or you know, I don't want, I want to go hang out with a bunch of hot chicks.

Speaker 1:          08:20          Lsu, you know, it's, the focus has been wrong for a while and uh, and that is evident in special forces selection when we don't have anybody to pick from. We can't select. Wow, why don't we hear about this? Is it something that we're trying to keep posher it, it has been a problem because our community motto is the quiet professionals. Mm. That's our motto. How do you fit into that? Yeah, I don't, I mean, I get so much crap all the time. Um, but thank God like guys that really understand what I'm trying to do. They, they realize I don't shut up because I'm trying to help the regiment. I'm trying the best ways that I can, the best ways that we can figure out with people way smarter than me helping me. You know, I was on the phone yesterday with some of the best and brightest in the special operations recruiting battalion about how were we going to fix this? How are we going to market? How are we going to develop interest? And, um, so thankfully they're smarter than me. Um, but we were almost screwing ourselves over because that is

Speaker 2:          09:30          what,

Speaker 1:          09:31          how we live. And that's how we would do our job. If you read about us on the news, we failed. You know, if you write about army special forces doing something, we met, we have done messed up you. Now, this is not the navy seals. We're not writing books. You know, we're not talking about our exploits. We didn't kill bin Ladin. Um, this is us just doing our work and nobody's supposed to know about it. But because of that, we now have a huge recruiting problem.

Speaker 2:          10:04          Okay.
