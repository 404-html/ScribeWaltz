Speaker 1:          00:00          But again, you know, this isn't because the drug is bad, it's because people use it irresponsibly. And this is something that people have so much difficulty understanding. We're so eager to blame drugs for all of our problems. Drugs have never heard anyone. They're just inanimate constellations of carbon and hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen. They don't jump out of their bags and vials and attack your serotonin receptors are dopamine transport or anything like that. So this is just a weird pattern that we've done repeatedly over time. And I don't know if you read the new Michael Pollan Book. I know he was on the podcast right now. Yeah, it's great. Yeah, it is great. But um, one thing that I thought was interesting about it is that he put a lot of the emphasis on the prohibition of psychedelics on leary and leary almost certainly played a role, but I think it's slightly ironic that he's a journalist and didn't really go that deep into the role that journalists played in all of this, which was humongous.

Speaker 1:          01:00          You know, journalists are sculptors of public opinion and it became the standard way of reporting on any of these things to say that they're bad, to sensationalize it and to not have any consideration for what that would do. Because anytime a journalist writes him scare story, they can really mess with drug policy in a serious way. It might seem like nothing like, oh, there's a bunch of people in Brooklyn and they overdosed on some obscure synthetic cannabinoid amb food Banika who cares about and beef Herbenick I know. Big Deal say that it turns people into zombies and if it gets thrown into schedule one, who cares? Not a big deal. Well, that's a very short sighted way of thinking about all of this because that's exactly what happened with psychedelics. And then we're not learning from the mistakes of the past that just because something, it's fun to sensationalize and talk about how dangerous it is at this moment doesn't mean that 10 years from now we're going to recognize that it has serious therapeutic potential and we made a big mistake outlawing it.

Speaker 1:          01:59          And I think a lot of that also comes from this sort of us versus them mentality that people have where it's cannabis is good, synthetic cannabinoids are bad. Well, synthetic cannabinoids don't have to be bad for cannabis to be good. Cannabis can be good without something else being bad to counter balance it. You don't need to hate something to justify your love of cannabis. And this whole hatred of synthetic cannabinoids I think is totally misdirected because these are products of prohibition that most people wouldn't even want to use in the first place. And when they do use them, they don't know what they're taking. They don't know what dose they're consuming. And so of course they're having bad experiences that would happen with almost any drug. Caffeine included if people just consumed enormous unmeasured doses without having any idea what they were getting into. And so they're thrown into schedule one.

Speaker 1:          02:45          What happens if 30 years from now, once the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids is being really seriously explored, we find out that that amb food Banika that everyone was saying turned homeless people in his zombies in Brooklyn in 2017 turns out to activate a certain subtype of the CB one receptor that's especially useful for Parkinson's disease or something like that. Then we're going to regret having done that. So I think people have to be very careful. Anytime you say anything negative about a drug, you have to be very, very careful because the implications can be enormous. I think that the best stance and all of this is to not speak ill of drugs, drug the drugs have breakthrough drug enthusiasm, but it's not a problem. Also with just what journalism is, it's like asking a comedian to talk about something but not make fun of it.

Speaker 1:          03:33          That's what their job in a certain sense is to get people excited about things. And I don't know whether you'd say the lazy way out or the common approach is to say something that scares people. I mean that's, that's what clickbait is mostly about. Either outrage or fear. That's true, but there's a lot of richness in truth. I agree, but it's hard to sell. It's hard to sell that rich and hard to sell. I think the people are lazy. You know, there's this idea that a lot of people have that you know, journalism is organized by some malevolent Rupert Murdoch type puppeteer who's telling everyone to. You go off and you say that cannabis causes car accidents and you go off and you say this evil thing about this and say the alcohol is good. Did you see when a Alex Jones was on my podcast and got high with me, I'm drunk and I, and when it came up in his trial for is a divorce. He said that George Soros puts a, He tests marijuana every year to see how much George Soros is influencing the levels of THC.

Speaker 1:          04:41          That was his excuse. But people love these ideas. They love the ideas of the puppeteer and malevolent puppeteer because it denies individual agency. But the reality, and I say this as a journalist who's worked at many different publications, not just device, and this is a difficult reality to swallow, is that people are free to say whatever they want most of the times. And the journalists choose to report on things this way. That is true, but it's also true that they, like I've been a part of stories that I've talked to the author of it and they said, well, this was manipulated by the editor, the editor of manipulated the title the chain. That's a great excuse. But to the right, and it's true, like the rolling stone did an article about me and they called me as psychedelic warrior and I said to the guy who wrote down, what the fuck is that?

Speaker 1:          05:25          I was laughing and he goes, dude, I did not write that. Yeah. And an editor gets a hold of it, tries to make it more salacious. It becomes something that's more, it's more likely for people to buy or click. Right. Especially with headlines that that is true. And the real problem is that this sort of outrage culture and comment culture that has emerged provides no incentive for truth. Because suppose someone were to write an article about this conversation we're having right now, and it could say, Hamilton Morris says Katam should be illegal, or something like that. Then that will get so much more engagement because then you'll have all these people saying, fuck Hamilton, he's a, he's a trader. How dare he say that? It should be illegal that it didn't watch it, and then you'll have other people arguing with those people saying, well, listen to the interview. Hey, he actually never said anything about that and listen carefully to what he was saying. And then you create this whole engagement, a bigger engagement for doing the wrong thing.
