Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. So there's very, very few fake Jujitsu, black belts, but occasionally there are some and they get outed and there's some hilarious videos online. If guys go, where is it? Where does Steven Seagal fall in that line? He is a legitimate I Quito black belt. In fact, he was an instructor, one of the very first Americans to teach at a Dojo in Japan. I know shit. So Steven Seagal. But the martial art is the questionable thing. It's the martial art of Ikea. Edo Is, it's really a martial art that was created to disarm people with swords. The idea was that you lost your sword in combat and someone was coming at you with a sword. Last ditch effort is you had to be able to use someone's momentum against them. You gotta be able to use, some guy comes at you with a sword. You have to be very adept at catching their arm and flipping them over.

Speaker 1:          00:59          Here's the golf. Very subtle, right? Let's, let's not use this because it's, it's, it's easy to poke fun at him when he's old, but let's go to that black and white one. You see that black and white one down there. Go to that. If you go back, see that one right there. Steven Seagal. Go to that one. Now there's some some footage of him when he was young. Yeah, this is a go. Fullscreen is legit. He is very legit and he was thin. It was a different thing like, but the thing is nobody comes at you like a fucking NCAA wrestler would shoot a double on him and take him down faster than you can possibly imagine. I mean this does not work. It's a dance. Well it works. It works. If someone does know what they're doing or if you have a lot of physical attributes, like the Gauls a huge guy.

Speaker 1:          01:48          He's a very big guy and he probably could pull that off on a lot of people who don't know how to fight. Yeah, I hear this is what it was about. What I keo was really about, this is Kendo though. They're using swords, which maybe they do use some of that and Quito. But what a kito was originally created for, I hope I'm not mistaken, was learning how to disarm like that. The guy comes at him with a knife and he flips the guy and takes the knife away. He's using the guy's energy against them. That was the original intention of Ikea, but in terms of the Japanese martial arts, I Keanu was never thought of as the most effective judo is far more effective because judo involves people grabbing people and flipping them and slamming him on the ground. Like there's a great video of an old judo master.

Speaker 1:          02:37          See if you can find this video. There's this guy, he looks like he's about eight years old and he weighs about 13 pounds and he is lit. You can tell, especially someone who knows martial arts, you can tell when someone's just giving in the problem with a lot of these demonstrations of my kidos guys are just giving in like this old dude watch this old dude, the old dude and the right hand side is so much bigger than the other guy and they're the guy around and like he's really throwing this guy right. This is legit. Like this guy's trying not to get thrown and he doesn't know what to do when he trips him to the ground there. But this old guy is tiny, but he's using perfect leverage in perfect technique and fuck. He looks really old in this picture. Like the guy's trying to throw him there and he can't pull it off and he can't pull it off because the older guy has perfect position and perfect. What does the name of this video? Perfect leverage, right?

Speaker 2:          03:28          Whoa.

Speaker 1:          03:29          Nine years old. Judo master is the name of the video online. And I don't know if he was really 90 but he certainly looks like it could be 90 but this old guy just knows how to, you notice also the back of his heels are always like lifting up. He's moving, but this guy's trying to throw him and he's just, and the guy who is trying to throw him appears to be a black belt. At least he's wearing a black belt. Fucking incredible men. It's really amazing. So judo was a much more effective martial art and judo was actually what was taught to the Brazilians. Um, when count my ada went to Brazil and uh, taught people, um, in Brazil PR, particularly the Gracies, they taught in Brazilian Jujitsu. The Gracies took Brazil what was judo at the time and they took the ground attacks of judo and just perfected them and then hone them and changed them and made them more technical and really worked on utilizing leverage and utilizing submissions.

Speaker 1:          04:29          And they, they turned that into Brazilian Jujitsu. So Judah was standing as well as ground? Yes. There's a, a ground aspect of judo, obviously, like Ronda Rousey's probably one of the most famous submission artists in the UFC. And her background was in judo. She was a judo player and very good at judo. She was a bronze medalist. So when she would get ahold of people, she would just fucking throw them on their ass and flip them and toss him and slammed him to the ground. She just had phenomenal judo, but also a wicked arm bar. And that was because the Ne Waza, the, the ground attack version part of Jujitsu, uh, comes from judo. So there you go.

Speaker 2:          05:06          Yeah. My father did judo and he taught it to me and my brother. And then I remember my brother was bigger than me and he used to flip the fuck out of me and then he did it to me one day and my father grabbed him and flipped him down on the ground. He was like, this is not good. This is isn't like passing on. No, this is just a violent family attic control. Who's his dad? Drunk. He was six foot two six right in his hand. A cigarette? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:30          Oh fuck yeah. Judo is legit. Judo is way more legit than a kito. It's not an Ikea does not legit

Speaker 2:          05:37          I. Quito is like, it's a lot of pressure points and holding the wrist in different ways.

Speaker 1:          05:42          Yeah. Most of it is throws and learning how to take an attack or look, if you just charge forward and an Akita guy and you have your, your right hand come on like cocked and ready. Just run out and throw that punch. A really good a kito. I was going to grab that and flip you and slammed me on the ground. Right. But you know, how often does that come up? Yeah. You know, most, especially today when people actually know how to fight, it's just a diff, it's too limited. Yeah. But there's a lot of martial arts like that. Like there's certain aspects of karate that are applicable, but there's a lot of it that's really limited.

Speaker 3:          06:25          Okay.
