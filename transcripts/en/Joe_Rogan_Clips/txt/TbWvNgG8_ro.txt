Speaker 1:          00:00          You mentioned the thing with feet and I was watching blue planet to the other day and there was, it's not a fish apparently, it's called like a toad of some kind, but it's, it hangs out on the bottom and it has feet. It's, it looks like a fish that grew feet. It walks around. Yeah. That's not a fish. I don't believe so. It's actually a some sort of toad I think technically. Whoa. But yeah, and they look like human feet almost like how his toes and everything.

Speaker 2:          00:23          Well, one of the weirdest things that I ever saw about the ocean was there was a theory that was going around a few years ago that I don't know if this is legitimate, not go Google, that they think that it's entirely possible that octopus Octopi may have come from eggs that were frozen and landed here from an asteroid. There was speculation that there was something about the way, yeah, the way that they pro, you know, the DNA and RNA of octopus are so different than every other animal in the fossil record that it's almost that there, there was a consideration that they might have actually been an alien species because you know the term, you know what Panspermia means. Panspermia is a theory that is pretty widely accepted in the scientific community that some life is transferred through asteroid collisions. So like that, say if a chunk of rock slams into our planet and knocks a chunk of rock loose in that chunk has DNA on it and the amino acids and all the building blocks for life, that bacteria, whatever it is, things that, some things, you know, little things can survive in space like tardigrades little life forms can to survive in space that they slam into a planet eventually and then when they do that, that life is transferred onto that new planets.

Speaker 2:          01:41          Science News. Holy Shit. The buses came to earth from space as frozen eggs millions of years ago. Okay. But this is like the, the express. Yep.

Speaker 1:          01:50          I was trying to, I read it a little bit, but that's, that's the most feasible version of aliens coming here. Yes. We tend to think of it as it lands and they're like a spaceman who looks like George Clooney steps out but he has like antenna or something like, hi, I'm, I'm here to share with our, our planet all, all tuna or whatever and he speaks English and all this shit. Like it's, it's on a, on a biological level that we almost can't comprehend. You could go back to that James, please

Speaker 2:          02:16          look what it says that the extraordinary claims made an a report entitled the case of Cambrian Explosion, terrestrial or cosmic, which caused by a group of 33 scientists and published in the pro uh, progress in biophysics and molecular biology journal. And the paper suggest that the explanation for the sudden flourishing of life during the Cambrian era, often referred to as the Cambrian explosion lies in the stars as a result of earth being bombarded by clouds of organic molecule. Wow. I think that's also the theory of how water got on earth. They came from, it came from comments, cause when you see comments, comments are all water and I think like millions of years of us can hammered by comments. Huh? Like you know when you see the trails of comments, that's literally ice, dirt and debris coming off of that comment. I didn't know that. Literally the more you know, the more you know it in a comment, but it, they think that about mushrooms as well.

Speaker 2:          03:19          They think that spores can survive in a vacuum. So if something like say if some spores were attached to a rover yeah. And we shot her off to move to the moon or something like that and it got there somehow or another, if there was the right conditions for that thing to grow, that they could actually survive the trip and then grow on the moon or on Mars or anywhere where would be water and sunlight and atmosphere, like invasion of the body snatchers. Yeah. We'll spores or even weirder. Right. Because spores create mushrooms and mushrooms actually breathe oxygen and you breathe out carbon dioxide. They say they're, they're closer to an animal than the art of vegetables. Yeah. That's uh, that's, I've thought about that when I've, when I've eaten magic mushrooms a lot. Right. It's like I basically just ate an animal. Well, you also feel like it's taking, like it's alive inside of you communicating with you.

Speaker 2:          04:11          Right. Don't you feel like that? Like it's not as simple as I'm getting high. No, I smoke weed. I feel like I'm getting high when I eat mushrooms. I feel like I'm entering into the thought process of an alien creature. Yeah. You, you put on like a space suit on the inside in a way and, and you're, you're evolving a certain way if only for like seven or eight hours or something. Yeah. Do you ever microdose now I have friends that do that and Ron White's big into that. Oh, is he? Every day you'll have found [inaudible] but good kind of medicine. Oh my God. Ron. Ron White kills me, man. I just, you just pick their most random name you could have, but I'm just like, that makes perfect sense.
