Speaker 1:          00:00          No, he's, he's wicked. He made one for my dog. It did John Wick and as fuck too. Oh he did? John Wick and his daughter. That's from John Wick dose. Not John Brick. Uno twisted [inaudible]. Can I get a couch surfing from John Wick? One ran was, I'm wrong. Well it's from John Wick one that he had the pit bull. Yeah, it was, yeah. Yeah. John Wick two. They killed the Beagle and then he had the pit bull and they started going to killing spree. It doesn't have a three out now. They're another one working on it. Yeah, it's coming out soon. Yeah, he's cool cat. I ran into him at a deus ex machina down and uh, Santa Monica Venice area and he was on one of his bikes and it super cool. Rad Dude. Just, hey, what's up man? Keanu Reeves must be one of the nicest, coolest people in the planet cause no one has a bad word to say about that guy ever.

Speaker 1:          00:55          He might, he might be what we should all sprite or be, we should all aspire to be Keanu Reeves who are, you might have some really crazy secrets. No, I don't know that he's the nicest. It seems like everybody runs into him, you know, like, I'm sure there's some people that ran into you where they caught you the wrong way and they're all went sideways for a little bit. Nah, not really. I mean I, but no fucking Keanu Reeves. He got it going on. But the point, what I was going to get to is one of the things that those movies did was they, they elevated the profile of those muscle cars because she saw that movie and they went, this guy for this, something about him. I know he's murdering people. I know he's the best at murdering people. I know he killed three guys in a bar with a pencil.

Speaker 1:          01:38          I know that. But look how fucking cool he looks. He's got, he's got the dopest suits. He's killing people. He's not killing people. And An underarmour rash guard. Okay. He's killing people in the dopest suits. He's stabbing people in the neck and he's driving a 70 Chevelle ss. But the trick is unlocks your fore mentioned and loved Eleanor.

God dammit, I forgot to kill somebody. I'm doing it just like that. God, come on, it gets out of a shit. He's got craters on it. A Chevelle ss from 1970 with Craig's. It's Torque for us. Look. Yeah, look how good he looks. Well that or style, um, that, that's a classic white wall tire. I mean, come on man. Or white letter tire raised white letters. That's class and you can get your own now you can get your name on it. You could do anything. You'd have gas. There's a team that sells like see stickers, monkey tires. I should fuck Keisha. You can actually order stickers now that, that are the rubber letters that fused themselves into the rubber on your tire. So you end up with a white letter like that and you put anything on there. Wow. Like Joe Rogan or constantly.
