So during my time on the teams, we actually had a person that was, um, she claimed to have a medical disorder or she didn't actually claim to have it, but supposedly it happens. But she claimed to have a disorder where she had attachment to items. This girl that was on my team actually ended up marrying the Eiffel Tower. Are you serious? I'm not kidding. She went and she had an attachment to, yes. She actually filed some claims against, supposedly filed some claims against a bow company that this boat company actually had a rubber laminate on the limbs of the bow and Mary's, I feel cow.

Speaker 1:          02:56          In the middle of all this, there's a lot of people like me that I've shot tens and tens and tens of thousands of arrows trying to win a metal for the country. But that's different. You're chasing an accomplishment. The bridge. Yeah, they just trying to fuck. Meanwhile, she's on our team bus. She literally, she slept with her bow one night edit at an event and then got an infection from the silicone on the limbs and the rest of the team had to deal with this problem. Um, when you say infection, I don't know where the infection was, but I have met Elle. Oh No. I had on a step away from it, but hey, how good was she as an RJ? Me, this is pretty rare. He's actually like gloves. This son of a bitch. Um, how good was, she has an archer. She must have been very good.

Don't do it. Don't do it to me. John does. I would say decent. Good Archer. Danger decent. Here's, here's the thing. Okay, so she married the Eiffel Tower. How'd that work out? I think she's still married to it. Friends. People were pissed. This is true. This is 100% true. French people are pissed because American just goes over there, gets his fiance visa, marries a tower. Right? So now we've got a dual citizenship. Meanwhile, she's got this thing for the Berlin Wall. Yeah. Okay. Well, the Berlin Wall is a flirt, first of all.
