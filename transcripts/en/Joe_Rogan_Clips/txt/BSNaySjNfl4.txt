Speaker 1:          00:00          But there's been such a significant improvement in all those places that the resistance tends to, I mean, how many people arguing for reversing the cannabis legalization? Hey, you don't ever hear it now. Right. And it's been a little bit of a backlash and it kind of absurd, but because it's come out repeatedly kind of victor like artist Ilo, I actually had that guy. I really tell me about that. Why, how did, we had a debate between him and Alex Bernstein and a doctor, Mike Hart from Canada. Um, and there's some, there's some reality to the dangers of cannabis use as some people that are susceptible to schizophrenia. Um, and I think that there's also some, at least anecdotal evidence at a points of the fact that some people experience these psychotic breaks and these schizophrenia episodes probably directly as a result of large dose use of Thc, whether it's through edibles or whether it's through smoking at some people freak out.

Speaker 1:          00:53          I've known people, I've known of people that have had real issues with it. I mean, had a comedian here a couple of weeks ago, talked about he doesn't smoke pot, he's from Brazil. He smoked pot, a s of use, a vape pen, uh, took a bunch of hits and was fucked up for two weeks. There are, there are dangers and problems, certain pizzas. So it's really important. The case for legalizing cannabis is not that there was no harm associated with cannabis, right? In the same way the case bill legalizing alcohol is not, there's no homeless. I said, well, this is what Alex Bernstein is trying to go over in his book. I don't think he did a good job for two reasons. One, because he's basically only making the case for it to be negative. And I think there's far more evidence that cannabis has a positive influence on people.

Speaker 1:          01:35          It reinforces community. It makes people more sensitive and kind. This a thought of paranoia might actually, it, it makes people more humble. Um, it makes sex feel better and fix food tastes better. There's, there's creativity aspects to it that are undeniable. There's a lot of very positive aspects to it. For some people it's not good, but it's like saying, hey, some people die when they eat peanuts. Let's outlaw peanuts. I think that one of your children about peanuts, I think everything you just said is absolutely right. I think there's another layer that's going on at the same time, a kind of below that, which is really important people to understand. So there's this thing. Um, so very often people will say, ah, you get kind of republican politicians like caught. I'm a colleague Thena arena saying it during when the Republican debates in 2016, 2015 maybe, um, we can't legalize cannabis because it's much stronger now than it used to be.

Speaker 1:          02:26          Thc content is called up. People are smoking skunk. It's really important to understand why that happened. It's because of drug prohibition. So the day before alcohol was banned in the u s the most popular drinks by far were beer and wine. In the weeks after alcohol prohibition ended most popular drinks again, where they're in wine as they are today. In between, you could not get hold of bear and wine. The most popular drinks, whiskey and moonshine. You cannot, you think, well why would that be? What's going on? And it's because of a kind of slightly wonky and boring thing, but I think it's worth talking about is called the Iron Law of prohibition. If you imagine, if we had to smuggle the nearest bar to here, if we had to smuggle all the alcohol for that bar in a wagon from the Canadian border, from the Mexican border, right from Tijuana in a wagon, we fill our wagon with beer, we're going to get drink for a hundred people.

Speaker 1:          03:14          If we fill it with vodka, wigging it, drink for thousands of people, right? So when you ban a drug and it has to be smuggled around, you get a premium on getting the biggest possible kick into the smallest possible space, right? This is why mild forms of the drug disappear before opiates were banned in the United States. Most popular way of consuming it was something called Mrs Winslow Soothing Syrup, which you would buy in the pharmacy, right? Very low level of opiates. Most popular way of consuming cocoa based products prior to the banning was Coca Cola, right? That's called that for a reason. Uh, when the ban happens, heroin becomes something from opiates. Powder cocaine becomes the only form of cocaine. In fact, when there's a huge crackdown on powder cocaine and the ATS, the iron law kicks in even more. And that's when crack is invented. Cause you can get even more of a hair into an even smaller possible space.

Speaker 1:          03:59          Right? So I think at some point to understand if you want, it is not good. Most people who drink alcohol don't want to drink vodka and they certainly don't want drink absinthe most of the time. Right. Most people want a mild form of their drug. That's true. Cannabis. That's true. Of course, there's some people who want to get totally fucked up, either for fun or because they have addiction problems. Most people want a mild form of the drug is not good that malforms or the drug when they're not. I don't think that's true. Uh, it's definitely not true in California, in California, what happened was medical care cannabis got passed and what's medical cannabis got passed. There was a an emphasis on the strongest possible stuff because people wanted it. I mean, it was a direct result of people having higher tolerances because marijuana was so readily available and they, if you have a high tolerance and you smoke a lot of pot, you want strong pot because week pot doesn't do anything.

Speaker 1:          04:49          It's the number one complaint amongst cannabis enthusiasts is someone having week pops. You've got a subculture of people who are cannabis enthusiasts who you're right, there's a subconscious just like there's a subculture of people who want Volcker App south. Right, right. But I don't think it's a matter. It's not the same thing. Like Jen obviously is more potent than whiskey or then beer rather. It's easier to carry gen around. You have to carry less of it. With cannabis, people are still buying the same quantity. They're just getting more fucked up because their tolerances are so much higher. They need a stronger and stronger THC. So as you have a legal market, you can have a variety of options, right. What you have is what would, what we'll discover. I think as time goes by, because we know this with alcohol, is different people want cannabis to do different things. You're totally right. There's some people who want maximum THC maximally fucked up. Just some people where there's still a market for for lower grade we'd, I mean they have it listed at all these dispensaries. They have it listed, you know, 20% 35% they have it listed so you can choose a more mild marijuana if you like to, but the oh gee people, the people that do it every day, of course they want that really potent weed. It's not like I would say they're

Speaker 2:          05:58          more like the people in Vegas who gamble a professional gamblers versus the people who go to Vegas for the weekend and just want to play a real well. There's definitely a concentrated market, very dedicated users who want to get maximally fucked up. You're totally right. I think that's what pushed the Po. I mean it's also in botanists and I'm friends with a bunch of people who breed and grow these various strains. But if you think about, so professor David not has done really interesting work on this. So if I remember rightly, there's 38 active components in cannabis, right? So cannabinoids, well there's hundreds of cannabinoids. So I think the, if I'm in from press and not sweat the, that he argues this 38 kind of significant active components, maybe other people. Yeah, I think there's over a hundred canabinoids I think we just discussed this, right?

Speaker 2:          06:41          Right. Then we, uh, so one of the things he Auggie's and I'm happy to be quoted on the specific number, but one of the things he, he Auggie's um, is you've got it, cause you were talking about schizophrenia and psychosis. I think it's important to understand there is some evidence that very high exposure to THC in a small number of people can, can lead to psychosis. Right? And that's even a small number of people where you have a very widely used drug is, is that's really problematic. Right? But actually this was readjusting evidence. So why do people who are prone to psychosis or schizophrenia want cannabis? Right? Cause there was a lot of them who want it. It's not the people, hardly anyone wants to have a psychotic episode. It's actually so THC, um, uh, correlates with, with psychosis in some people. But there's another component cannabis called CBD, uh, kind of a dial, which actually we know there's good evidence sue the psychosis and schizophrenia, right?

Speaker 2:          07:35          It's actually given us a treatment in some places in distilled pill form. So actually it's a slightly more complex picture then cannabis causes psychosis, right? Very rich THC in some people will cause psychosis. That's a real problem. There are things we can do to prevent that. And one of the good things about legal market is you can regulate it. So we can limit the amount of THC that is available. Just like we can limit, you know, you can't go and buy 70% proof alcohol, but also what, what, what professor not has been arguing is we need to be, and they exist, but they need to be commercialized and promoted more, um, or promoted and public health way. Not necessarily commercially, um, CBD rich cannabis will actually be helpful to people with psychosis and schizophrenia. It's just a slightly more complicated picture. I know that you, you're not saying that it is, you're not endorsing what the, tell your kids go.

Speaker 2:          08:24          What's it called again? The guy who did your debate. Um, our experience too. Yeah. I know you're not endorsing the kind of simplistic view on either side, but the, the, um, I think it's slightly more, slightly more complicated than that. The other thing I think is really worth saying though to people is, there's one thing we will do agree on, which is cannabis is bad for young teenagers. Right? After developing brains, there's one person I interviewed, it really helped me to, again, to think about this guy called Fred Martins who's in, I went to go see him in Camden, New Jersey, and Fred was a co, he's retired now, but he was a cop. I was really kind of right wing. You reminded me of the Clint Eastwood character in dirty Harry. He's not a liberal. Right. And he had this, he wouldn't use a fancy word like this.

Speaker 2:          09:04          Behind the epiphany about drug legalization. One day he was in a car park in Wayne, New Jersey in 1971 it was staking out a dealer and he's in plain clothes obviously. And a kid comes up to him like an 11 year old or something and goes, hey Mr, um, I'm not allowed to buy alcohol where you go into that liquor store and buy some for me and frank guys now get outta here. So the kid walks over to the drug dealer and buy some drugs from him instead. And Fred has this kind of realization, which is, oh, he wouldn't put it this way, but legalization puts a regulatory barrier between kids and drugs that doesn't currently exist, right? This is why since they legalized cannabis in Colorado, there's been, don't overstate it, it's not huge, but there's been a significant fall in teenage cannabis use, right? Drug dealers don't check ID licensed legal businesses, do they really care if they're there because they've got something to lose? Right. So I think if sometimes it's used as the kind of protect our kids argument is used as a case for prohibition. In fact, if you want to protect your kids, you should be putting a big premium on getting these substances out of the hands of armed criminal gangs and into the hands of licensed legal businesses.

Speaker 1:          10:10          Yeah, I don't think anybody's going to argue that. I mean I think that anybody rational rather, uh, I think that makes a lot of sense. I think that, um, the, the number of people that have schizophrenia is fairly, it's fairly stable in terms of the percentage of it across the board, cannabis users or non cannabis users. And so the argument against this idea that cannabis causes schizophrenia breaks is that these people already have schizophrenia and it just hasn't really manifested itself in a, in a a tangible sense. So this is one of things. Thanks

Speaker 2:          10:41          professor nuts says, so there's this, there is some evidence that cannabis, uh, in a small number of people causes psychosis as a study in Sweden that showed this with schizophrenia. It's much more contested. So, so psychosis versus schizophrenia, what is the major distinction? Yeah. I've not researched this in depth, but um, psychosis involves, is that the different, the different paranoia. Schizophrenia is a subset of mental illness. This very specific has a significant genetic component, although there can be environmental triggers for it so it could possibly trigger both. It could possibly trigger psychosis and schizophrenia argument against that. So professor, so there is evidence with psychosis, the argument we're stress, it's a very small number of people but it Israel, um, uh, and, and there are things we can do an illegal market to counteract that, that much harder to do in a prohibitive market. But with schizophrenia, the argument against that, and I've not looked into this and a huge amount of detail, so I don't want to, this is not the same degree of confidence I've been saying the other stuff, but um, professor not argues, well, we know that cannabis use has massively increased in Britain, for example, I think something like 20 fold increase since 1916 Britain and yet levels of schizophrenia have remained the same.

Speaker 2:          11:50          If cannabis was it causing schizophrenia, you would it

Speaker 1:          11:54          to vary with cannabis use at least to some degree. There'd be some relationship and that doesn't seem to be the case. So again, that's what professor [inaudible], who's the former chief scientific advisor on drugs in Britain, says, I haven't looked into that in great detail. So He's basically right. And all the things that I have looked into that he says, hmm, um, do they know what the mechanism would be that would cause someone to consume THC and have a psychotic break? Have that, does that have an exam? I don't know enough about it. It would seem to be a big issue, right? Like, find out what it is that's causing this trigger and whether or not this exists in these people anyway, and maybe a stressful situation and a bad breakup losing their job, maybe one of those things can also cause his trigger.
