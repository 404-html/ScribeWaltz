Speaker 1:          00:00          You know, man, it's like even what's going on with the pope just recently said there's no hell. And everybody went crazy. Like what? What did Hsi, the pope said, there's no hell. He's, he's slowly bracing you for the fact that all this is nonsense, but right now we're going to get rid of hell. Like this is like one of the, one of the purest examples of like the change in people's attitudes towards a religious real. Yup. Yup. The Vatican denies that, but the Vatican did not say, there is no hell, we'll find out an article where it says, he did say that 50% shit, he's not going to cut it back. Go back in time and find an article where he did say the guarantee you, he did say it. Let's just assume at one day that, see this is what they do. They say it a little bit and then they take it back.

Speaker 1:          00:47          So they get used to the idea that they're saying it. That's what it is. I'm, I'm full Eddie Bravo right now. I'm full conspiracy dude. This is how they set it up. They start out with uh, uh, uh, they tell you the hell is not real. And then they say, we never said that. And then a year from now they say, look, we're pretty sure hell is not real. This, this pope probably place fort night and shit. And he's like, he's a cool pope. He doesn't have the pope. He's got his Connie liaison. He's the cool pope. He is the cool pope. He got rid of the throne. Oh yeah. Yeah. He had a big giant crazy ass thrown for the last guy. The creeper. He's got a Gamer chair down those racing chairs. The headphones. It's got one of those Pope Francis in the fucking house.

Speaker 1:          01:34          Pope Francis has no problem with gay people either. See Pope Francis fighting with Yo litter kid. Yeah. See, look how he swapped. You look at the old, the old thrown versus the new look at the two side to side. The guy on the left to God, they just kicked out for crimes against humanity and the guy on the right is the new guy who's just got a sensible chair. Much better. Yeah, the throne is creepy man. That is crazy. And He dresses much more conservatively two. He's not wearing crazy wizard robes. He's wearing like a one color wizard robe. He dresses like r Kelly on a Sunday. Just crazy. Like if he came out and like a polo shirt and a pair of jeans. No, right? No. Everybody like, hey you can't be the Paul put without the fucking magic outfit. Where's your fish head hat?

Speaker 1:          02:24          Come on Bro. He's got body armor on. He's got that hat on like a golden salmon that's coming out of the top of his head. Like show me that hat is fucking hat. Sad is preposterous. That's out. That's like a monster and a, that's a mouth of a monster. I ah, like a like a giant snake. It looks like a Napkin at a restaurant when you go there and it's sitting in. Oh and it's nicely done in south Wales. A little rings. He probably put it on by mistake. Like he's just like, look at me. I can't believe they're making fun of our Holy Father Cause just on this fucking show sucks. You'll make it fun of our Holy Father. He's right there with the smoke.

Speaker 1:          03:05          Oh my God. How is this still legal? Look at these kids dressed up like they're in Harry Potter's seminary until Dwarf that. They look good. They do. They look like they'd go to that. What's that Hogwarts school. They do. This is fucking ridiculous. Universal talking to this dude who's holding up a golden version of where the savior was murdered, right? He's got a golden cross is crosses all over the place like don't forget about the cross, and he standing there dressed like a wizard. This is craziness and everybody's gonna know this is our religion. This is our culture. This is weird. This is weird, and I'm not saying it's not beautiful. It's absolutely beautiful. I'm not saying it's any weirder than going to the opera because I think that's weird too, but this shit is weird. This is some really old form of education slash entertainment that people used to do before they had plays.

Speaker 1:          03:56          They get together and some room. What's fucking crazy? Different colored glass windows in it. Why didn't he have a mic on? Why did that kid got to hold the mic? And because Jesus doesn't want him to be magnified. That's a thick mic though. Yeah. Manager. It was pink. She had a pink Mike. What's the deal? What's up? Why's it have to be silver? I like pink, pink, pink Mike. It's uh, it's crazy, you know, and it's a billion of us and I was raised there. I mean I was from when I was real little kid did at least one year in Catholic school, but was around a lot of Catholics. You know, I don't, I'm not claiming to be an expert in it, but I don't have to be that Shit's bananas. I used to be an altar server. I used to hold that. Mike, did you really? Did you, were you ever in the middle of doing that? Going, what in the fuck am I doing?

Speaker 2:          04:48          Not, well the most of the times we did it when it and me and my friends talk about, we would get out of class so we would, because I went to Catholic school, there'd be services during the day and funerals even sometimes we get paid to be out of class and then we would like miss two or three hours of school.

Speaker 1:          05:01          Wow,

Speaker 2:          05:02          20 bucks, get some donuts, miss lunch. You know? That was really all we were doing. I used to just have to light the candles like me and this other kid would come out and late. All these candles.

Speaker 1:          05:11          I always wanted to be the guy that puts them out with that bell bell and the hook. That's so bananas when you're in that room and they'll see, you see those benches all laid out up to the pulpit like this is so crazy. This is, it's, it's like people figured out some way to make the bridge between physical evolution and mental evolution. Like there's this bridge between us not being monkeys anymore, but still we just want to get out of the barbarian behavior. We've got to figure out a way to get people to like have reverence for something. It's all and just control their behavior. We've got to slow down the chimp in a set a monkey and that's what it looks like. A monkey. The monkey statue, the feast of the chair of Saint Peter and addressed what is the, the statue is just a bronze statue of Saint Peter is a dark statue.

Speaker 1:          06:17          Try and tell you St Peter was black truth. There's a, it's weird. When we were in Charlottesville, the, they had the black Israelites there that were right out in front of the building. They'll, they used to set up shop all the time and New York is to run into those dudes. Just wander down the street. I was told that because I'm Italian, I'm not white. I said, Oh yeah, two told me that. I was like, thank you and do you see true? I know what you are. I did see that. I did see that, but yet I'm certainly not black, so keep telling it. According to these black Israelites, I am not white, so I'm okay.

Speaker 1:          06:58          The nit true nation. Is that them? Cause I love how they dress. They, I mean they take that whole pope shit to the next level. They're like fuck that man won't be like he mad master of the universe. God Damn dressing. It's crazy. Look at how they're dressing. They have shields and shit bro. Go to that. Make that picture bigger. Please make that picture bigger. These are serious people there on the street. They're reading from the Bible. One guy has a sword, kids guys got an ax. The other guys got to pick acts like he's going to go find gold. This is one of the craziest pictures of this is real. Is that real champion? Be Real. That's like, go back to that please. Jamie, go back to that police for a second. What did, what did it say? There was something in the um, the text that went with it.

Speaker 1:          07:42          Is that it? Yeah, there it is. What does it say? Passover 2012 Isu p. K. Passover from Wikipedia. So it looks like a mix tape. What is that High Holy Day Passover in Harlem, New York. 2012. Oh my God. So that's the black Israelites at the high holy day. Passover, black Israelites who think there are different kinds of Jew that the so called Jews that looks like fun. I'll do that. Um, it looks like fun until someone gets drunk and starts swinging an ax around. What do they got there? They're teaching white people stuff. They got these posters. Six, six, six. Preach on brother. Okay. They dress cool though. Look at that outfit. All leather. Giant star. David Dude has a sword. No big deal. Just two dudes walking around with a stored there. It is like a fucking like, oh, it looks like a holiday inn or something. Right? This isn't like some sort of banquet center. When they have the sword, they showed the picture of the sword. Where are they? Where the fuck is that going on that? That seems like a very public place. That was sword. So what's that place to eat at? And they all look like that. Your Horse Chow stows medieval manner type places. It'll eat the times. Maybe two times. Yeah.
