Speaker 1:          00:00          Felt like one day where I did, I got 935 points in one workout and then another hundred points afterwards. I'm like, one day like that was separate me from the pack. Just one day. Just put fear in their home. He just asks you something just to be fair that everybody here. What about stuff? Some of the stuff doesn't that kind of, you mean like testosterone? Yeah, 100% helps. I told them, I told them, this is a fucking shoot. Shit. All those mills shut. I gave them my doctor's information. I told them what they should do, but I'm also at least eight years older than all. Right. How old are you? 41 41 I'm 51 now. I'm older than all. Yeah, but the testosterone. Oh yeah, you should. I'm failing all those tasks. Yeah. Testosterone replacement therapy, hormone replacement therapy. I started doing all that when I was 40 so that's their age.

Speaker 1:          01:03          Yeah, it makes a big difference. Makes a big difference. Fuck yeah. It look, listen, everybody, everybody listen to this. There's a stigma attached to that in a lot of people like you know, where do you get your testosterone from or get it from my balls. All that matters is that you have it in your system. If you don't have it in your system, you're not going to feel as good. It's real simple. If you're fine with not feeling as good, good, go ahead. Stick with that, but if you're not fine with it. This is 2018 hormone replacement therapy exists for a reason and that reason is it makes you feel way better. It makes your body work way better. You can avoid a host of ailments and conditions that are related to your body breaking down due to age with hormone replacement therapy. The key to doing it though is to do it correctly.

Speaker 1:          01:56          He's supposed to go to a doctor that's going to test your blood levels, test your nutrient levels, and adjust your diet first. The first thing that happens is they, they want to find out how much you're sleeping, how s how stressed out you are, what are you eating? How much water are you drinking? Are you getting the proper amount of protein and vegetables eating correctly? Let's get you off of this sugar. Let's get you off the booze, let's get you off cigarettes or whatever the else is before they do anything. So they put you that. This is a many, many month process that I went through with a, they get you off all these different things and you make these adjustments and then they start adding a little stuff, add a little bit of growth hormone, add a little bit of testosterone. First it was cream and then it became injections.

Speaker 1:          02:37          It takes a little bit of time to figure out what works best and then you get to a point where you're, you have the hormone levels of a healthy young man. You don't want to elevate. You don't want to be higher than that. That's when you run into problems. You don't want to be in like some crazy. Vito Belfort, when he got popped from, you know, Nevada and he was like some superhuman levels that was 80 over, but my mother Sunday night against, he was supposed to fight rumble Johnson once the African done the Christian nice guy named Mark Mark. Mark. Quite levels are really high in Pittsburgh that night. That's right. Yeah. He was in danger. He was like it was there is dangerous to his health, the levels, but he says that was his doctor, his doctor fuck them. The the, the whole idea. Well this is a difference between, first of all, there's a big difference when someone who's competing in mixed martial arts.

Speaker 1:          03:29          Obviously you have to worry about your opponent getting hurt because of the fact that your enhanced, and these are young guys are doing this. When Nate was doing this, he was like 30 years old. Right. When you are talking about just general health and wellness, testosterone replacement therapy, hormone replacement therapy, there's a reason why a lot of older guys, especially guys who can afford it, they have money. They're doing it. It makes me feel better. It just does. And if you don't want to do it, that's fine. There's ways of elevating your testosterone natural. They just don't work as well with whether it's dead lifts are running hills, doing sprints. They work a little bit better. It works a little bit better than nothing, but it does lots of very good. Yeah, they release but not enough for what you're saying. No, there's going to be a difference.

Speaker 1:          04:14          I just get a raise him through acupuncture. I know that she's discussed raising, but it was at this tasco acupuncture. I would like to see studies on that. The problem is it's really painful at some just painful for that. Really Nice. It sits in your feet. Yeah, I like to see studies on that. I don't know if that's really been proven. If that was really proven like there's, there's ways to raise it. You know, the chick I was with for years told me different case studies that she had been involved in. Yeah. She told me a guy came in once then found the younger girlfriend. His wife passed and they found that he had a girlfriend and he couldn't keep up and he couldn't keep up. So he came into the CEO and she did a bunch of stuff and put them on a t. He came back a week later and said, turn that shit off. Dick will not shut down like, but she told me, she goes, I could raise your testosterone levels, but it has to be neatly into your feet and you got to find that a little bit uncomfortable. And I was like, leave it alone then. I don't want to fucking walk around all this stuff that we're talking about. Um, whether it's hormone replacement therapy or squats or dead lifts or all these, all these things will help.
