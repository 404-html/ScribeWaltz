Speaker 1:          00:00          I have the probably the most minor of brain damages. Probably the most minor cause I stopped when I was 21 yeah. What's your number? How many times I got hit and I mean like how many times do you think that you like, oh that did damage? Oh, 100% there's a bunch of them. There's a bunch of them that I could think back. Getting rocked and feeling my knees go like getting punched in and then keeps barring heaps barring spar, two more rounds of that guy spar three rounds with another guy. He's hitting you in the face too. Like you didn't stop. It was really dumb. He'd get hit and you get rocked and you didn't, nobody likes sat you down and go, okay, let's take the day off. And then you get right back in there, man, you're fucking legs would go bang. But your legs would go and you cover up and you know people be throwing bombs on you and you'd next day sparring again.

Speaker 1:          00:48          Could you, is there a way to detect it? Like get at your brain scan so you can see her ways now. There's better ways now, but I had a limited amount of it. I mean I had the real getting wrapped in the head for me came when I tried to transition from taekwondo to kickboxing or doing taekwondo. I got, I definitely got hit in the head for sure, but they didn't get hit in the head as much because it's hard to kick people in the head. You definitely get hit. I mean I don't know how many times I definitely got hit, but I'd never got knocked out from a head kick butt. I got knocked out from punches before at least Ko Tko Tko but when when a punch hits your face, it's like your, your legs go everything like shuts off. Like if you get rocked and you, you see like a person go down.

Speaker 1:          01:31          It's not that they go down like, oh there's so much pain I have to go down. No, you get hit and everything shuts off. It just goes boom. And then you feel your legs like rubbery. Trying to stand back up. Did you just watch the last UFC where Edson Barboza head kick. Kevin Lee see that he's spinning wheel kicked him and you see Kevin Lee's legs just go blank. They just gave out for a second and then he came back and those those ones I got way more when I was boxing. She got way more of those like I was, I was not good at boxing. When I first got into boxing, I was learning, I was good at taekwondo, but then I got into boxing. I was not good at it. I didn't know what I was doing. I didn't understand the distance. Taekwondo, you didn't punch in the face and we punched the body. So you had a real distorted perception of how good you were with your hands. And then once I started boxing I was like, Ooh, this is terrible. And that's, that's what I was taking like probably the most damage of my life of a period of like two years of like a lot of sparring, did a lot of sparring. Everybody sparred everybody's part with everybody. People knock people out all the time.

Speaker 1:          02:39          This just stupid. So stupid. I see guys get knocked out. I mean out cold, right hand to the chin, boom. Eyes rolled behind their head, legs give out, they bounce off the canvas. They put a cold towel on him. They put some ice on his head, he gets up. He's like, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good. You want to keep going? Yeah, let's keep going. Let's keep going. No, you would just unconscious. You would just unconscious five minutes ago and you want to keep sparring. This is crazy. And they'd let them, they let them keep spar. You did it from when you were like really young, right? Taekwondo from one owes, why took karate classes when I was 14 but when I got super serious I was 15 I was like right at my, before my sophomore year of high school. So like I got into it from the time I was in the, uh, ninth grade as I was 14.

Speaker 1:          03:27          Like that summer, like right after my birthday around is when I started getting into Thai. So I was probably either 14 or just turning 15 asked like was there a point you could tell where people actually could be able to knock people out and give that damage? Cause there may be 14 year olds can knock you out or the whole time. The thing about kicks is almost anybody can knock you out. It's really crazy. Like when you think of the amount of power that you have to have like in your legs, like say if you decide to put a heavy backpack on, like one of those outdoors mins, atlas trainers put 90 pounds on. You could walk up flights of stairs. Dude. Just think how much power that is in your legs. You could throw your body up flights of stairs for exercise just to Bush Bush, coach your body is whatever you weigh, one 5,200 whatever your way, your body's just launching that through the air over and over and over again.

Speaker 1:          04:22          Even if you're a girl that weighs 135 pounds, you're still launching 135 pounds through the air. And if that girl fucking shins you boat Blang right on your temple, I, it goes across the jaw, temple area, got blind. Your legs are going to give out, your brain's going to shut off if somebody hits you. Perfect. There's a video of a, I think the guy was shot, I think it was, I think it was mighty Mo, mighty moe, who's this huge kickboxer. I believe he was Samoan and I mean just like typical Samoan Dude, big giant fucking powerhouse of a dude. And he fought this little Thai guy. This Thai guy was 175 pounds, so much smaller than them. I mean it was crazy to watch and tie guys just moving away and moving away and moving away. And then the Thai guy roundhouse kicks him in the head. This guy like, look at the difference in size.

Speaker 1:          05:20          Yeah. And watch this. This dude just comes over the top. I mean the difference between the two of them. Mighty moe is a base to seriously dangerous knockout puncher. He put a lot of guys to sleep, so not as this guy in there with someone way bigger than him but he's in there with a killer. But look at that one head kick and mighty most down and out. I mean backed that up again because that is a crazy thing to watch. You're talking about a guy who might've been a hundred pounds lighter than him and mighty mouse. Just a vicious puncher. Bang. He just claimed him right in the head. That's what I'm talking about. Girl does that to you? Night night son. Yeah, I was thinking more like two 10 year olds like no knock each other out. That's a good point because the thought process is that if you teach kids technique, don't teach them to just go on these wild fucking haymaker exchanges but teach them how to do it correctly.

Speaker 1:          06:13          It's good to do it when they're young because they don't hurt each other cause they a little tiny arms and they just kind of touch each other and they can't really generate knockout power. They just sort of, and if they learn how to do that from the beginning and then develop knockout power and the pads and on the bag, then you develop much more technically proficient fighters rather than brawlers. So the problem with fighting is like most people don't fight to the physical ability of their body. Like they, they just, they decide like they're going to knock this guy out, I'm gonna try to hit him with this. And they think in this real limited sort of linear, aggressive, like almost obvious manner. Then you got guys who see past that who take things to a new place. You got guys who, who figure out that you can be like really elusive and confusing and then you see those guys fight like limited blocky, like obvious fighters.

Speaker 1:          07:08          And like Anderson Silva in his prime is a perfect example that Anderson was an artist. I mean he would just, he would, you didn't know what he was going to do it study you. He'd be moving around, he'd be standing in front of you, he'd be dancing, a just be following you around and then all of a sudden he just say, I got this motherfucker figured out. He would just move in on your bank and you didn't know what was coming flying knee. He didn't know what was coming. Roundhouse kick front kick to the face, know what the fuck was coming, man. It was a totally different kind of fighter. So the difference between that and a guy was just a like a powerhouse of a person and can knock guys out but never, never achieves this sort of mastery of space and distance. They win fights through brawling and power and just kinetic brute force rather than artistry and avoidance and countering like Conor McGregor when he knocked out Joe's a Aldo perfect example, all of those like fuck you charge Anam Connor slides back, flap drops a fucking left hand on the button, pop out and he's the champ champ.

Speaker 1:          08:09          I mean come on. Or champ then became the champ champ champ. But that that, you know, that thing is, it's hard to figure out. Sometimes guys just decided to rub, they'd rather buy down their mouthpiece. Let the fucking chips fly. It's not fun. It's part of the end of a fight. Yes. Like the last 30 seconds, 10 seconds and they just throw it out. He could crazy cause they know there's no more time left. Yeah. They just try to win. I try to try to stop it. Yeah. Some of those fights are awesome. Look as a, as a person watching those things are awesome. There's two different parts. The way I look at fights, like I love a good Diego Sanchez Gilbert Melendez fight where they just fucking go crazy for three rounds. I loved that. That was one of my favorite fights ever. But I also love real technical fights where I see, I see like two artists trying to solve each other's riddle, trying to figure each other out.

Speaker 1:          09:01          You know like Luke Rockhold versus Yoel Romero. Was that like Yo, well just trying to figure him out and trying to figure him out. Maybe I move like this and then boom, drops that left hand on him. Same thing with him versus Chris Weidman. He just moving around. It's hard to figure out what he's going to do. Hard to figure out what's coming and then wome flying knee to the chin or to the head. He's a, he's a great example of a guy who just figures out how to break your rhythm and figure it through rather than just running that Yang because clash, clash, clash, you know Frank Mir was just talking about that fate or fight and he was saying that his ego got the best of them. Did you see the fight? It was a really good fight. Really crazy. Until fate are Keto, them fade. [inaudible] caught on with the left hand and dropped him and put him away.

Speaker 1:          09:47          But before fade or cowed him, Frank Mir had hit fade or, and it got interesting in the very beginning seconds of the fight but then fade or hit him with a perfectly timed hip throw, which is fucking boom. I mean sent him flying through the air and slammed him to the ground. And apparently frank said from that moment on, his ego got the best of me is trying to get them back. And then he wound up just getting this crazy brawl and getting knocked out. It's really fighting to me. So it's so interesting. You know, it's just so interesting when you see all the different things that people can do and how they're going to match up together and out. What one person's going to be able to figure out how to get there, their ideas through my ideas. I want to kick this motherfucker in the head. How can I do this? I've got to figure out how to get to and his ideas. I want to take this guy down and punch his fucking face in. How do I figure out how to do this? And then the two of them are just like trying each other's strat and you don't really know. You don't fucking know. You don't know until they get in there. For the most part, it's great a shit ever.
