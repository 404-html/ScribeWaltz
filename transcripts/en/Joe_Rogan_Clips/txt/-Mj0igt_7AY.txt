Speaker 1:          00:00          Reality could be like an onion, we don't know, but it could be like an onion to where you think, you know, you're studying a layer of an onion and then you peel it away and there's more and you keep doing it. And there's an infinite number of layers with intelligence. There's the same kind of component to where we think we know we got it, we figured out, we figured out how to beat the human world champion to chess, we solved intelligence, and then we try the next thing. Wait a minute, go was really difficult to solve as a game. And then you say, okay, uh, I've, I came up when the game of go was impossible for artificial intelligence systems to be and if not recently had been beaten within the last like five years. Right. And next last five years. There's a lot of technical fascinating things of why that victory is interesting and important for artificial intelligence.

Speaker 1:          00:47          It requires creativity, correct? It does not. It just exhibits creativity. So the technical aspects of why Alphago from Google deep mind that that was the designers and the builders of the system. That was the victor. They did a few very interesting technical things where essentially you're develop a neural network. This is this type of artificial intelligence system that looks at a board of go as a lot of elements on it is black and white pieces and is able to tell you how good is this situation and how can I make it better? And that idea, so chess players can do this. I'm not actually definitely over the game of go is that can speak to I'm Russian, so chest to us as romanticizes the beautiful game. Uh, I think that there you look at a board and all your previous experiences, all the things you've developed over tens of years of practice and thinking you get this instinct of what is the right path to follow. And that's exactly what the neural network is doing. And some of the, some of the paths it has come up with are surprising to other world champions. So in that sense it says, well, this thing's exhibiting creativity because it's coming up with solutions that are

Speaker 1:          02:13          something that's outside the box. Thinking from the perspective of the human when why? What do you differentiate between requires creativity and exhibits creativity? I think one because we don't really understand what creativity is, so it's almost,

Speaker 2:          02:33          yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:34          it's on the level of concepts such as consciousness. For example, the question which there's a lot of thinking about whether creating something intelligent requires consciousness, acquire as for us to be actual living beings, aware of our own existence in the same way. Does doing something like building an autonomous vehicle, that's the area where I work in. Does that require creativity? Does that even requires something like consciousness and self awareness? I mean, I'm sure in La there's some degree of creativity required to navigate traffic and in that sense you start to think, are there solutions that are outside of the box and AI system? You used to create it. It's once you start to build it, you realize that to us, humans, certain things appear at creative, certain things, dope. Certain things we take for granted, certain things we find beautiful and certain things are like, yeah, yeah, that's right.

Speaker 1:          03:31          Well, there's creativity in different levels, right? There's creativity like to write the stand was Stephen King novel, and that requires creativity. There's something about his, he's creating these stories. He's giving voices to these characters. He's developing these scenarios and these dramatic sequences in the book that's going to get you really sucked in. That's, that's almost undeniable creativity, right? Is it? It's a, he's imagining a world, what is it always set in a New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Maine, Maine is, right. So he's imagining a world and imagine the emotion of different levels surrounding that world. Yeah. That's, that's creative. Although if there's a few really good books, including his own that talks about writing. Yeah. He's got a great book on writing and it's actually called on writing. If there's anyone who can write a book on writing, it should be Stephen King. Uh, I think Steven Pressfield, I hope I'm not saying the war of art and the war of art.

Speaker 1:          04:30          Beautiful Book. And I would say if, from my recollection, they don't necessarily talk about creativity very much, that it's really hard work of putting in the hours of every day of just grinding it out. Well Pressfield talks about the muse. Pressfield speaks of it almost in like a strange, mystical, mystical sort of connection to the unknown. Cause he, he almost, I'm not even exactly sure if he believes in the muse, but he, he, I think if I could put words in his mouth, I have met him. He's a great guy. He was on the podcast once. I think the way he treats it as deaf, if you decide the music is real and you show up every day and you write as if the Muse is real, you get the benefits of the muse being real. That's right. Whether or not there's actually a muse that's giving you these wonderful ideas, and what is the muse?

Speaker 1:          05:26          So I think of artificial intelligence the same way. There's a quote by, uh, Pamela, uh, McCormack from 1979 book that I really like. Uh, she talks about the history of artificial intelligence. Ai began with an ancient wish to forge the gods. And to me, God's broadly speaking or religions represents, it's kind of like the muse. It represents the limits of possibility, the limits of our imagination. So it's this thing that we don't quite understand that is the muse, that is God, this us, us chimps are very narrow in our ability to perceive and understand the world. And there's clearly a much bigger, beautiful, mysterious world out there and God or the Muse represents that world. And for many people, I think throughout history and especially in the, in the past set of a hundred years, artificial intelligence has become to represent that a little bit to the thing which we don't understand and we crave.

Speaker 1:          06:28          We're both terrified and we crave in creating this thing that has greater, that is able to understand the world better than us. And that in that sense, artificial intelligence is the desire to create the muse is this other, this imaginary thing. And I think that one of the beautiful things, if you talk about everybody from y'all, I musta Sam Harris to all the people thinking about this, is that there's a mix of fear of that, of, of that unknown, of creating that unknown and an excitement for it because there's something in human nature, the desires creating that. Because like I said, creating is how you understand.

Speaker 3:          07:11          Hmm. Did you initially study biology? Did you study the actual development of the mind or what, what is known about the, the evolution of the human mind and

Speaker 1:          07:22          the of the human mind? Yeah. Uh, so my path is different as it's the same for a lot of computer scientists and roboticists is we ignore biology, neuroscience, the physiology, anatomy of our own bodies. And there's a lot of beliefs now that you should really study biology and he should study neuroscience. You should study your own brain, the actual chemistry, what's happening, what is actually, how are the neurons are interconnected, all the different kinds of systems in there. So that is a little bit of a blind spot or it's a big blind spot. But the problem is, so I started with more philosophy almost. It's where, um, if you think Sam Harris is the last couple of years, it started kind of thinking about artificial intelligence and he, he has a back on, you know, science, but he's also a philosopher. And I started there by reading [inaudible] or dusty yefsky thinking, what is, what is intelligence?

Speaker 1:          08:25          What is human morality? Uh, will, uh, so all of these concepts give you the context for which you can then start studying these problems. And then I said, there's a, there's a magic that happens when you build a robot that drives around. I mean, your father. Um, uh, I would like to be, but I'm not yet. Uh, there's a creation aspect. That's wonderful. That's incredible. It's for me, I don't have any children at the moment, but the, the act of creating a robot where you programmed it and it moves around and it's census. The world is, this is, is a, is a magical moment.
