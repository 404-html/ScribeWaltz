Speaker 1:          00:00          I think that's so bizarre to me is that we're sitting here and we're talking about the age like the wise, if guns were just created like you know when in reality, right, but something's wrong. But what's wrong is it the, it's not the guns. I'm asking you, what do you think is wrong? Mental Health, right? So I say I agree with you, but I think it should the two ration of culture altogether. Like they used to be taught the Bible in school. Like you know what people, people make fun of that now. Like now we've got this culture where you're making fun of kids. Like religion is like, we're so far away from religion. Like that's like weird to us. Like you know like teaching religion is like, it's, you've got like an oak scarlet letter. If you come in as like a crow, a holy Christian kid in like a normal public public education thing, you've got the family structure where it's like these kids are running the houses these days.

Speaker 1:          00:39          Like I look on like Facebook and it's like supposed to be funny when like a four year old is acting like Cardi B. I'm like okay. Yes it's funny cause she's four but it's also like not funny cause she's four, right? Like how do you feel about Little Tang? Who's a little tay? I Love Cardi B. I know a little tay is, it was time. He's kind of out of the news now because they found that it's a hustle. She's a nine year old Asian girl from what? Vancouver and she talks mad shit, throws money around, calls everybody bitches and haters yet. But that's my point. Like this is considered like funny. It's like entertaining, like the fact that, and we're okay with that. And so parents are pushing their kids to be more outrageous cause there's a way that they can make it. So to me it's like hanging out with Rick Ruben.

Speaker 1:          01:23          She looks like she's, she like, how old is she? She looks like she's, Oh those are hooks at the horns up and she's got a g wagon in front of this. It's just like the cash me outside girl. Right. So we don't talk about any of that. We don't talk about the fact that that we no longer focus on family. We know it's no longer just focused on religion. Doesn't need to be, does it mean to be that everyone needs to be religious, but their structure and religion right there structure in, in me, when I grew up in and my grandpa used to make us read the Bible around the table, there was some structure to that and lessons and prayers that, and then there's this mass, the, the Facebook, the snap, the snapping, the, the Instagram or Twitter. It's like we've changed the world and expected children to say in stay the same of it and nobody talks about it.

Speaker 1:          02:04          So he said, they say it's the gun's fault. We need to, we need stricter gun gun legislation, but the entire world has shifted. We're not talking about those changes. The dynamic of the world that has shifted. So I, I just hold a different position. I, you know, I think it starts with family. It starts with structure. I think we need, we need religion back. I think that that needs to stop being such a dirty word and to stop being mocked roundly by the media. Like it shouldn't be funny. You know, when joy bay, um, you know, says something about Jesus and the whole audience giggles. That's weird. Mike pence because he talks to Jesus did give a how weird that is, right? Like how weird that the stuff that we used to would be normal. Like you know, praying, talking with you. You just like when I grew up that was like my grandparents' generation.

Speaker 1:          02:47          That was everyone was religious and now we're so far away from that, right. That, that, that seems like, like it's okay to mock and we roundly mocked it all the time. So these are the, the structure in the home is, in my opinion, the most important thing that needs to change. The fact that some people are growing up without fathers in the home is something that needs to change. Letting your kid have a Facebook account when they're seven, right? Like it just, there's just too much. It's the information age, but what information are they downloading? Well, I definitely think that people need structure. I definitely think that people need family and community and all those good things, but when it comes to religion, it's like, which one is right as a hobby, right? It's not about being right. Yeah. It doesn't sound like there's not, I know I'm going to be honest.

Speaker 1:          03:29          I know nothing about Scientology, so I'm not, I know that people hate Scientology. That's all that all I know about it created by a science fiction writer and it's all nonsense. Right? That's all you need to know. Okay. Yeah. So it's one of the dumbest religions of all time. If you read like what they are, Leah Remini who was in it for years, I didn't watch her series. She been on my podcast and she explained her journey into it and what happened with it and when she started to question it. And there's a whole thing there. There's a, um, what is the fucking Hbo Documentary? It's also the book, the HBO on Scientology. The Lawrence Wright going clear. Going clear. Yeah. I read the book and I watched the documentary. So crazy boy, I know nothing about it besides like Tom Cruise, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be honest with totally ignorant.

Speaker 1:          04:17          It's, you know, for some people, here's the thing, for some people its structure and its helpful, right? Ideologies are helpful sometimes because they give you like a, like a format to live your life by or scaffolding to keep your, your, your moral beliefs inside of these boundaries. And it helps you get ahead and you have purpose in decision making. But at the end of the day it's a cult, you know, and there's a lot of them. So a lot of different ones. So like how do you decide that there's something that comes from, I think just learning certain lessons. It doesn't need to be too, I'm not saying that we owe something like structure structure. Like the Bible used to be taught in school objectively, they would be taught by people that, you know, we're not practicing Christians. Right. Um, used to be taught in school objectively because there's still lessons that are timeless in these Bible stories.

Speaker 1:          05:04          It's something to do with whether or not your, you don't need to then say, oh, and then we go to church and then we pray in school and all that stuff. You can almost extract that and try to teach these lessons objectively. But, but kids are learning now is like how to be an anarchist. Like you know, feminism one o one and every, it's, you're like actually fostering an angry culture by telling them at every turn if they should be outraged. We are in outrage culture. And then your, your surprise when somebody does something outrageous. Right? It's a little bizarre to me. It's like, oh, everything should piss you off. Everything should make you angry. Everything should make you upset. Everything is up. Just as unjust. Everything is oppressed. And I don't know why this kid just show up at school. I see. So angry or weird. It's like we're weirdly fake. I know whatsapp, the conversation, the shooting happens and everyone's talking about the NRA. And then David Hogg is back on the news. Jordan Peterson has some interesting ideas about religion and the fundamental beliefs and um, the lessons

Speaker 2:          05:58          that are learned from things like the Bible and how they apply to human life and that our, our own belief systems without them, without the sort of structures and belief systems is one of the things that leads civilization astray and that it's done that before and things go awry.

Speaker 1:          06:17          Well I actually had this debate with Charlie and I did a panel, I'm down in DC and we were talking about whether like, you know, the reintroduction of, of God and teaching them to school. And I said like at some point there seems to be the struggle. I have this idea that like human beings in a certain way, we're doomed to just keep repeating history. I'm obsessed with Greek mythology. I'll obsessed with like Egyptian history hieroglyphic like anything that like w where they tell stories, especially Greek mythology because the lessons are there and we just keep doing it. Right? Greed, lust, like the things that human beings fall for. Right. So I had this idea when we were talking, cause Charlie is, is an evangelical Christian. I'm not right. I believe in, I, I the super smart guys and Evangelical Christians. Does he believe like Jesus came back to life? Yes. Really? Yes. He's an Mhl group

Speaker 2:          07:02          believes that someone died. Yeah. And then three years, three days later they came back to life and that they walked on water and

Speaker 1:          07:09          yeah, I mean you have to, I haven't really gotten into with him because I'm not like, I'm not the person that should ever be like debating or talking about religion. It's not my shtick I guess. Um, but so what, what I said to him, cause me and him both believe that in many ways, the reason that the government has, uh, the media has started roundly dissing Dodd, right? Like in dissing, he says Christ is because the government wants to be God. Right. So if people don't know,

Speaker 2:          07:31          do you think the media is responding to the government suggestion? Is that what you think the reason why people

Speaker 1:          07:38          religion is because the media is responding to some sort of orders from the government orders. That's, that's wrong. So it's, it's, it's directive. No, no, but you know, Andrew, Andrew Breitbart said that politics is downstream from culture, right? So, and you can argue that they feed into each other, whatever it is, but there's, there's definitely something, um, between culture and politics that is linked, inextricably linked. Um, so, uh, when, you know, when everyone's on the same page, like, so if the government wants to get bigger, which it has been doing right, and wants people to look to them for answers, which it has been doing, you have to understand, they have to sort of destroy everything else that they would potentially be looking to for answers. Right? So instead of when you're down and out and people would just go to church and pray, right? Or believing in your family or the family structure, they need to know that no matter what you think the government is the answer.

Speaker 1:          08:30          That is what a leftist, at the end of the day, the glut believes the government can fix all of their problems. And, uh, and I find, especially when I speak lot, I love us. They do not believe in religion. Like, and there's just a thing. It's a trend. I've noticed that, you know, I'm not religious, I'm not saying that, you know, there's something wrong with it, but leftists tend to be, you know, really apart from religion. So you could make, the argument could definitely be made that the destruction of believing in Bible, of stop teaching the Bible is because you want to make it so that every time you have a problem that cause you're still going to our soul. We still need to believe in something. We're naturally beings that we need to believe that something can fix something. I really believe that that is the reason why we go get our palms red, right? Like we just like there's, there's something else. Somebody has the answer and people are starting to believe it's government in America and it freaks me out. I agree with you that people like structure, and I agree with you that people without religion try to find that structure and those rules and other things. But I don't believe that this is like some calculated government by nature. I think it's human nature shifts.
