1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,940
To Watch out about the scientist because,
because he said no,

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,100
the NASA plan, when he found
out what it was, what is,

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,600
it's a breakaway civilization where
you don't try to run the whole planet.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,010
You Siphon off resources and build a whole
new advanced system and then you play

5
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:19,560
or body off against each other
and collapse it. So when I say,

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,300
what is an Assa if we could take NASA
back over, it's bigger than the CIA.

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,230
It's the real government, the space
ships and the stuff that's all PR.

8
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,860
NASA is the real government.
NASA,

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,910
there were two breakaway governments to
shadow governments and Brad talked about

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,350
Saturn Garber 20 years ago.
So it's in,

11
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,530
it's in the documents and so you had
one that was British run and the Germans

12
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:48,270
came to the, our own us elite and said,
hey, you always need a couple of plants.

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,600
They said, we've got all this
on the drawing board, the EU,

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,600
a plan to poison the food water
to get rid of the dumb people,

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,600
a plan for Offworld basis.
We've got, by the way,

16
00:00:57,601 --> 00:01:00,000
we're taking hardcore drugs and
we're in contact with aliens.

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,450
How has it given us tech? It was the
Germans first got in touch. Well,

18
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:08,040
how'd they do it? They were
really a cult bridge, right? Yeah.

19
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,800
Really into the culture.
That's what all the Indiana,

20
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,150
which is a shit around him at all times.
So human sacrifices. Oh Shit. Yeah.

21
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,940
The real society. What I am
telling you, Joe, this is not me.

22
00:01:17,941 --> 00:01:21,150
You go to the real deep phd
level history books. Okay.

23
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,990
NASA is the German breakaway government.

24
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,570
Just always the Germans,
the Brits fighting for dominance.

25
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,370
So what you're saying is when operation
paperclip acquired all those Nazi

26
00:01:32,371 --> 00:01:34,560
scientists,
they essentially started running NASA.

27
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,340
So Nasa became like almost like an
offshoot of the German government.

28
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:42,570
This offshoot government. Yeah. The
Germans had piled all the wealth away.

29
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,570
They had everything. So they
make, does that make sense though?

30
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:48,600
That in 2019 that's still
going on? No, no, no, no.

31
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,450
The British intelligence
doesn't run the CIA today.

32
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,950
The British empire was under
attack and just bankrupted itself.

33
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:58,800
And World War wine. It said, we'll
give you the keys of the kingdom.

34
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,270
Churchill wrote three books. Uh, the, the
history of the English speaking peoples,

35
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:06,480
he was half American and
this is officially in books.

36
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,400
We merged with the British
empire and like 1930 covertly.

37
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,480
Okay. That's what the CFR is. British
intelligence that US intelligence.

38
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,250
So the u s runs the show. Okay,
so you've got, you've got,

39
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,210
but German intelligence came
to Eisenhower and say, listen,

40
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,380
you don't need to do all this. You, we
haven't given them the real technology.

41
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,030
We're in contact with aliens and
they've never the whole plan,

42
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,930
where are you getting this from the
stadium so confidently it's in the

43
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:39,270
literature man.
Hitler like would go literature,

44
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,820
mainline historical books about answering
this assess castles where they go,

45
00:02:44,821 --> 00:02:45,900
the aliens want blood.

46
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:49,030
So they'd killed like 20 kids and
everything's aliens would like come in and

47
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,390
he'll kill,

48
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,920
they taking the blood brings him in like
sharks and then they will not give them

49
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:55,800
technology. They go, this is how it works.
You build the atomic weapons this way.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,620
He built it and they would like show
him bombers and like the aliens are like

51
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:00,870
telepathic. I don't even believe this.
This is what the nausea believed.

52
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,520
And the and the aliens with MindMeld
and give them the technology.

53
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:07,570
They're bad aliens so they
are you surprised the Nazis
were influenced by demons?

54
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,470
Know if demons are real. Definitely
think they'd be on the side of the Nazis.

55
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,400
But Joe, what I'm telling
you, if the aliens media,

56
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,140
no media is going to attack this.

57
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,860
I'm giving you want to know where I
can read it? Where can I read that?

58
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,770
Those statements because they
were in contact with the aliens.

59
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,580
Obviously your pockets,
Brill Society,

60
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:30,570
the Ar Group,

61
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,500
a chick [inaudible] right up there with
them, like doing ritual for three hours.

62
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,170
If acting fly here with
a report the day before,

63
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,910
I'll send it all to you with
mainline books. I'll see.

64
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,290
I'll mail the books with the tabs in
them. Okay. And I'll mail documents. Okay,

65
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,630
cool. Yeah, I'd love listen.

66
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:49,180
I think that they are absolutely
obsessed with the occult.

67
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:53,140
That's been pretty well documented. They
made flying saucers and I think, yeah,

68
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,010
and I think many,
many governments,

69
00:03:55,011 --> 00:03:59,080
they developed a more advanced
form of nuclear fuel, heavy water,

70
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,980
and we had to shit in special forces on
suicide missions back when was really

71
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:06,490
special for us is to blow it up.
And I'm telling you,

72
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:09,340
the Germans had all
sorts of advanced shit.

73
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:12,610
They just couldn't ever keep the plants
from getting blown up because they were

74
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:15,570
a few years behind. Yeah. And by the late,

75
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,550
uh,

76
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,540
Churchill wrote about this in his memoirs
and said the Germans were way ahead.

77
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,380
It wasn't, the Germans were
bad that there's not such
a bad, but it wasn't that,

78
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:31,300
it wasn't the Germans that first
bomb civilian targets. In 1941,

79
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,920
the Brits were losing the war.

80
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,250
Hitler was bombing their for their
medical facilities and military facilities

81
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,150
and,

82
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:42,100
and so they went and bombed
German towns and German shit.

83
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:45,580
He's like, uh, I was the
famous German city Dresden.

84
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,100
What was the designated
a safe city for kids.

85
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,350
Half a million people died in one night
to trick Hitler to turn his bombers on

86
00:04:53,351 --> 00:04:57,400
the general population. Then they tricked
him psychologically to do it. But, but,

87
00:04:57,401 --> 00:05:01,990
but, but Churchill, this
has been declassified. It's,
it's, it's an esoteric books.

88
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:05,800
It's admitted. So Hitler was set up. Well,
there was bad. But here's what happened.

89
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:11,440
Albert Speer was he as chief armaments
and architects administered at British

90
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:15,310
trouble.
Agent Rudolf Hess was the deputy fuhrer.

91
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,400
They got Hitler totally love you.

92
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:21,520
Never hear about him since 1941 cause
they had a peace treaty with Edward the

93
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:23,680
eighth,
who was the king of England,

94
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,970
who was a Nazi and who was
German parish family, German.

95
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,410
And they had a deal to stage the attack.
The French stood down.

96
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:34,150
Vichy French didn't fight.
They put,

97
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:39,180
they put Nazi occupiers in the Dunkirk
operation was allowed to evacuate.

98
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,390
Edward the eighth was supposed to then
sue for peace through Neville Chamberlain.

99
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,780
But it's come out that it was all
set up by Churchill and others.

100
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,480
Not that they ran Hitler. They
weren't bad. They were pretty good.

101
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,210
But they master manipulated him.

102
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,500
And it never Chamberlain all of them and
bet on the British people in America to

103
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:59,780
come in. They had deals
with, uh, with, uh, with, uh,

104
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,860
Roosevelt to then bring us into the war.
And that was the whole master plan.

105
00:06:04,861 --> 00:06:07,370
And you can actually go to
the history and see all that.

106
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:09,230
And that's what's so incredible,
Joe, when you, when you,

107
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,320
when you have all this info
and so Rudolph Hash in 1941 42,

108
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:18,430
he flies a one man bomber.
He was a world war one fighter.

109
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,760
Aish like the number three, eight, like a
hot 107 aircraft. Look it up. Rudolph ash,

110
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,350
he flies in,

111
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:29,150
parachutes into the castle.

112
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:33,020
The king was in at the time and like
northern England, I forget the name of it.

113
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,790
He parachutes in with the peace
treaty shine by the King of England.

114
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,070
They lock him up in the tower for
the rest of his life in London.

115
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,940
Okay.

116
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,350
And Edward,

117
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:50,350
the aide had to advocate type in Edward
d a Hitler and you'll see him in videos

118
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,290
or films and photos.
He was in Spain and World War II started.

119
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,690
Where do you think the contact
with the aliens came from? Where,

120
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,140
when did that start? All right.
This was the most important thing.

121
00:07:01,141 --> 00:07:05,460
We're not aliens. Hold on. Hold on.
Inner Dimensional Aliens, alien.

122
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,770
It means anything. Not of this world.
What, when was, when did that happen?

123
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,620
That I sketched that
motherfucking fod code blues.

124
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:19,130
It's fake. I need to hear about aliens,
the guard, but I don't smoke marijuana.

125
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,550
Uh, yeah, that's marijuana.

126
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,020
You know what's crazy about aliens?

127
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:29,550
Is it a youtube made a big announcement
that they're going to go after at nine

128
00:07:29,551 --> 00:07:32,940
11 videos. Anything. I Dunno
if this is true, I don't know.

129
00:07:32,941 --> 00:07:37,941
But is it true that they're demonetizing
any videos that have truth or liberty

130
00:07:38,161 --> 00:07:41,430
in them? Is that true? Yes, that's
true. But I heard that, well,

131
00:07:41,431 --> 00:07:46,170
that sounds crazy interesting. Hold on,
let me finish. Let me finish real quick.

132
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,950
Uh, it's crazy how they're
going after nine 11.

133
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,170
Miracle Cure flatter and five,

134
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:58,050
they're blowing up alien videos.
They're blown on life. It's wonderful.

135
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,690
Strongest hold on. A ties videos out
there. I Dunno. But none of it's true.

136
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,850
It's true. Monetize. It is. Wow.

137
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,350
There's a lot of videos out there
than the best deals at the top.

138
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,990
Top of the line sponsored. No,
I'll tell you when Eddie's right.

139
00:08:12,991 --> 00:08:13,950
I actually know the numbers.

140
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,720
The blowing up alien videos was a
little kid who makes $22 million a year

141
00:08:18,721 --> 00:08:21,810
reviewing toys. No, no.
That's like the number one.

142
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,790
Isn't he like one of the
number one guys on Youtube?

143
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:28,270
It's like eight I'm saying alien
videos get monetized by fun.

144
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,780
High level sponsors.
The high level one because they're not,

145
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,650
they're not offensive. People get
drawn into them. Herman's Corinas up.

146
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,810
Why didn't they shut?
Not shut down?

147
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,350
Because they're talking about that the
government is lying and covering it.

148
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,160
Me because it's funny,
but it is.

149
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,790
How did the connection with aliens start?

150
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,230
You said this is the most important thing
you'd discussed on the podcast and any

151
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,900
I, I love you to death if you're awesome.
That's why I asked for you to be here.

152
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,630
If you want to believe in aliens,
I'm cool with that. I still love you.

153
00:08:57,631 --> 00:09:02,160
I don't care. I don't care
about that. Listen, I'm, this
is not what I believe. Okay?

154
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:07,020
I love you for who you ought to do. I'm
trying to tell you something. Listen man,

155
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:09,930
let me tell you, Shawn, let
me tell you something. Okay?

156
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,010
I'm not making this stuff up.
I believe you believe it. No,

157
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:17,070
I mean the stuff I told you earlier about
my dad to the table being offered half

158
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:20,290
$1 million in 1980 [inaudible] that
build cyborgs and the marijuana.

159
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,740
He wasn't here for that
part. Okay. He came in later.

160
00:09:22,741 --> 00:09:25,620
But tell me how the connection
with aliens cuts started

161
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:31,650
with who connection aliens and a notch
when people started becoming obsessed

162
00:09:31,651 --> 00:09:33,070
with contact with the aliens.
Yeah,

163
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,720
he was saying in 1947 rounds we'll
have some sort of a connection.

164
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,790
You know Eddie's right.
They flood youtube and mainstream media,

165
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,290
like they always thought it was safe.

166
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,600
I thought about the private
Federal Reserve that he
wold order if I went on some

167
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:47,820
big show,
as long as they mix the aliens in with it.

168
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,820
And I was never the alien guy.
Right. I've never been the big alien.

169
00:09:50,821 --> 00:09:54,570
He never years ago with you and
you know what I, that's right.

170
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,290
I remember when I was balls deep in
aliens cause I believed all that shit.

171
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:02,550
I believe it used to be that you'd be a
conspiracy theorist if you believe that

172
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:05,520
aliens, but amount anymore. But
now if you believe in aliens.
