1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,480
I want to shoot with that. Oh No, I
don't have to wear a backpack though.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,350
That's where it's weird.
What's this Mickey Rourke.
Oh, we'll leave it Tom. Yeah,

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:12,320
he's got a, what are the school
that was called a clutch? Yeah.

4
00:00:12,321 --> 00:00:15,180
Yeah. It looks more like a clutch.
Yeah, but he's so eccentric.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,000
I met him this past weekend.
He had a crazy cowboy that's,

6
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:19,500
we're looking at a
picture of Mickey Rourke.

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:25,050
He had a crazy cowboy hat on and he's
just, yeah, he's, he seems like a cook.

8
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:28,340
I mean, you can see that belt buckle,
like really like just, you know,

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:33,350
that's something I'm looking at like
good on him and he's just an odd duck.

10
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:37,590
I little round,
I for some reason it reminds me of,

11
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:40,840
it was an old onion article and it's
one of my favorite headlines and it was

12
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,170
Johnny.
Jeff found to be 90% scarfs.

13
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,470
He count like way scarfy after the whole
pirate movies, it went straight scarf,

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,110
like where are the rest of his life kind
of thing. He's like, yeah, he, he really,

15
00:00:55,111 --> 00:00:59,070
he really committed to that scarf thing.
When you're a beautiful man like that,

16
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:01,920
it's an odd transition to
being like a 55 year old.

17
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,040
I like what's up with Johnny Depp
lately? Not good things. I, you know,

18
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,540
it's, it's really strange actually.
They just this morning, um,

19
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,280
they delayed or like
actually like or canceled.

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,630
He is a notorious B I g movie looking at
that. He's in with forest Whitaker, uh,

21
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,120
and it was suppose to come out next
month and they just pulled it from the

22
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:23,350
schedule and they haven't
leg even said that the,

23
00:01:23,351 --> 00:01:26,070
it's ever going to come out or something.
And it's like,

24
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,830
and even just like looking at pictures
of him, like, it kind of just like,

25
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:32,010
there's something off about him, like
how you sucks, Dan hope he used to be,

26
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,190
he used to be really great. You
said, what'd you do to him? You fuck,

27
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,530
I don't even know who that is.

28
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:42,240
Doug Stanhope one of the best stand
up comedians ever. Uh, there you go.

29
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,700
He's a, I'm more of a Steven
Wright fan myself. Me Too.
Yeah. No lumps even. Right.

30
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,630
But I think, uh, I
think Johnny's just, uh,

31
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,320
he hit that weird spot where
you're just too fucking famous.

32
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,980
You can't go anywhere where you
were when you were little, I'm sure.

33
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,340
But you can coast now, right?
You can to go places like how,

34
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:06,030
how rich is rich enough? Like, dude, like,
like, yeah, like that's what it means.

35
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:10,230
Not just that, but he
spends, he only 14 houses.

36
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,840
He owns an island.
Millions and millions of dollars.

37
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,980
Did he spend like $5 million
shooting? Uh, uh, uh,

38
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,940
a hunter s Thompson's the Canon?
Yeah,

39
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,680
but they estimate that you spend
$1 million goes, no, of course not.

40
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:27,270
I spent $3 million. That's what
they asked him about his wine habit.

41
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:32,190
They said, uh, your attorney said that
your wine habit is $30,000 a month.

42
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:36,080
And he goes, that's an insult.
It's far more than, it's
far, far more than that now.

43
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,830
That's what I mean, like how,
and I'm like, all right, cool.

44
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:40,500
Like I guess he has to maintain it
and you know that lifestyle, well,

45
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:43,680
that's what he wants for himself.
That's what he's doing. That's his life.

46
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:46,280
His life is spending all that money.
Yeah.

47
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,350
Like his whole life is doing movie that
you know people though also when they're,

48
00:02:51,351 --> 00:02:55,590
they're involved in laborious projects
that they're not really interested in.

49
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,890
You know when you're,
when you're doing something all day,

50
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,880
and I say this is a guy who
hosted fear factor, something

51
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:08,530
that you really enjoy doing while
you're doing it. You're like, ah, okay.

52
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,350
Time to go to work. I mean it was
very thankful to have the job.

53
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,010
Don't get me wrong,
but the reality is it was not enjoy.

54
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,950
It wasn't a fruitful endeavor.

55
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,170
It wasn't like working for the UFC are
doing standup comedy or even doing a

56
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,490
podcast. It wasn't a passion
project. Exactly. So when
you do something like that,

57
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:28,780
like people on bad sitcoms in particular,
they spend all their fucking money.

58
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:29,614
They go crazy.
Yeah.

59
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,830
Because the only thing that they look
forward to is what am I going to do with

60
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:36,330
this money? It's reward a buy a
Ferrari. I got to buy a mansion,

61
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,500
I'm going to buy an island. And that's, I
think that's what Johnny got into. Yeah.

62
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,700
I couldn't see myself like doing a sitcom
or a television show kind of thing.

63
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:47,410
Like what about a good,
a good one?

64
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:49,990
I do like news radio is a fantastic
show look like. He must have been,

65
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:53,860
that must have been like a
fruitful endeavor. Reason
why I never did another one.

66
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,700
Yeah, yeah, exactly. I don't
want to ruin that experience.

67
00:03:55,701 --> 00:03:58,620
Every other one that came along
was like, this is shit go. They,

68
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,710
they pursued me for, for me for
a big bang theory. Oh Christ,

69
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,760
you got lucky to get that. And
I said No. I said like, no,

70
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,320
cause it was kind of like the way
that pitch was was Kinda just like,

71
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:12,430
all right these two like astrophysicist
nerds and then a pretty girl lives with

72
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:16,990
them. He links like, you know, and like
that, that was the pitch. And it was like,

73
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,270
yeah, it was just look at
it and they're like, oh,

74
00:04:19,271 --> 00:04:21,580
we're going to get some real like
physicists to like, you know, do the math.

75
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,830
And I said, look, yeah, no. I
said, I'm, I'm cool. Like thanks.

76
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,420
And then they came back at me again and
I said, no, no, no, look like again,

77
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,060
flattered but link. No. And then like,

78
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,090
then they came back at me again
and like even my manager was like,

79
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:37,780
twisting my arm and come on, I
want a piece of this, but listen,

80
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:39,910
I'd have hundreds of millions
of dollars right now.

81
00:04:39,911 --> 00:04:41,860
I feel like if I did that
Gig at the same time,

82
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:44,500
I'd be bashing my head against
the wall. That's the thing. Yeah.

83
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,620
I think that's what Johnny Depp's doing
and we can't really be into those pirate

84
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,350
movies. Yeah, no, he's just,
he's interested. And that's
the thing is that like,

85
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:54,350
he wasn't always like that. Like
it, it's all about the money thing.

86
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,660
I read an article, an interview with
him, it was about two decades ago,

87
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,430
and he was talking about,
you know,

88
00:05:00,431 --> 00:05:03,610
he was in his thirties and he was
doing a lot of weird, obscure movies.

89
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,950
Like what's that movie? Dead
Man, that black and white? Yeah,

90
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,300
he did a lot of weird shit.
And he said,

91
00:05:10,301 --> 00:05:14,410
this is kind of what I really like
and I don't, I'm not blockbuster. Boy.

92
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,530
Which is what he said. It's so
ironic. It's just so ironic.

93
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,010
They pull quotes and blockbuster
boy. Yeah, no, he goes, yeah,

94
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:23,380
if I ever like if you're,
if I'm ever a part of like a franchise,

95
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:25,950
like just shoot me or something like that.
Yeah.

96
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,540
They're pulled up these weird
like old quotes. It was a, um,

97
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,500
it's like the George
Lucas, like when he, uh,

98
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,860
he testified before Congress about the
colorization of movies and talking about

99
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:40,000
how movies are or are part
of our heritage and you know,

100
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:42,160
they shouldn't be
tampered with or anything.

101
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:45,910
He goes back and there's like 25 years
later he's going back and redoing his

102
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:50,470
movies. Yeah. It's like, yeah,
no, like once you put art
out there, leave it alone,

103
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,770
leave it alone. It's not yours
anymore. Like that's the thing,

104
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:58,730
like once you show like your paintings,
like that's not yours. That's the worlds,

105
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,060
that's an interesting way of looking
at it and you don't think it's theirs

106
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,310
anymore. Imagine, imagine you've
really already divinci like,

107
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,800
like just all of a sudden came back
into existence right now and he wants to

108
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:10,310
change the Mona Lisa. She's fat. Yeah.
Cause I like, I kind of didn't get there.

109
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:15,170
You know I didn't get the
smile, right. Yeah, exactly.

110
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:18,080
What her hair, it's all pulled back
and shit. I want to see a show.

111
00:06:18,081 --> 00:06:21,820
Should he be able to change it?
I want to give us some fucking jewelry.

112
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,330
I never finished the eyebrows.
Don't want to give a big tits.

113
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:31,730
I'm going to push them together. God,
come on. It's my fucking painting.

114
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,280
Yeah, exactly. I met
Devinci is a modern Italian.

115
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,500
Big tits would fucking glitter. It's
like he's like, you're living in,

116
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:46,430
I'm like Mulberry Street and
like in Little Italy. Hey Pizza.

117
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,150
Yeah, like a fake lips. It's where
I want, give me some claims casino.

118
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,480
Hey, this fucking broad. Look at her.
