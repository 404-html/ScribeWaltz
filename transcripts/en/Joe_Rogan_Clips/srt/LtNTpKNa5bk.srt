1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,120
I'm reading this book now about,
um, speaking of changing your brain,

2
00:00:04,121 --> 00:00:08,260
it's called a how to change your mind.
God is Michael Pollan.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,440
Yeah. He's been on the podcast
talking about, oh, no shit.

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:17,200
Did he talk about his new book, about
the, um, it, it's, it's basically about,

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,100
uh,
um,

6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:23,530
psychedelics and LSD and mushrooms in
particular and tell it traces the whole

7
00:00:23,531 --> 00:00:24,580
fucking history of it.

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,560
I had no idea how much research was done
back in the fifties and sixties. I mean,

9
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:34,260
they had conclusive studies
that were showing with, um,

10
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:35,973
alcoholism.

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:41,070
People were 70% of people that underwent
these treatments with psychedelics got

12
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:46,640
sober. Oh, depression,
cigarettes, cigarettes.

13
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:51,170
I mean, it's amazing. And all that
shit just got fucking thrown away.

14
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:56,170
Corrupt people kept that
information away from folks.

15
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,120
The studies that Nixon funded,

16
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,630
like Nixon funded a bunch of studies that
showed positive benefits of marijuana.

17
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,530
How is that right? You know, the
Nixon administration, just fucking,

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,080
can I get out of here with this
shit not releasing this one.

19
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,200
The other thing he mentioned
is that it got squashed by,

20
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,250
by shrinks because they had
a vested interest in people
not going into the woods

21
00:01:16,251 --> 00:01:20,660
for a weekend and coming back without
their depression. So yeah, so they,

22
00:01:20,661 --> 00:01:23,690
so they disqualified all
the studies. Oh fuck. Yeah.

23
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,010
What psychiatrists were like horrified
that there was these kind of results were

24
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,873
coming back.

25
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,170
Was it that for sure?

26
00:01:30,171 --> 00:01:35,030
Or was it people who've never taken
psychedelics horrified that people are out

27
00:01:35,031 --> 00:01:36,530
there experimenting with
their consciousness?

28
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:39,830
Because I think a lot of
these psychiatrists are
probably really straight laced

29
00:01:39,831 --> 00:01:41,690
guys.
And so in their mind,

30
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:46,780
especially in the shadows
of reefer madness and all
the propaganda they'd heard

31
00:01:46,851 --> 00:01:50,660
in the 30s and forties and when you look
at those people and they're out there

32
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:53,870
in the fucking desert or wherever
they're going dancing around and taking

33
00:01:53,871 --> 00:01:56,510
mushrooms under the moonlight, you like,
they're blowing their brains out here.

34
00:01:56,511 --> 00:01:57,350
You got to stop this.

35
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,900
If they're straight laced people
that have ever done psychedelics,

36
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,760
they might not be in cahoots.

37
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,840
It might more likely be a bunch of
people that think it's a fucking terrible

38
00:02:05,841 --> 00:02:07,760
idea to let people run
around and take an acid.

39
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,020
Well there was just some of the
medical journals came out with,

40
00:02:11,021 --> 00:02:15,890
with pieces saying that none of these
studies are valid because there wasn't a,

41
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:20,780
I forget what it is about studies
that have to be consistent. Um,

42
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,070
but the other thing is it was political
and you had Timothy leary who is,

43
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:25,910
you know,

44
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,410
the worst thing to happen to this kind
of testing because he was saying was it

45
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:35,090
drop, drop out in turn on, drop,
drop out. And that whole idea,

46
00:02:35,091 --> 00:02:39,200
they said, you know, we're people taking
LSD are not going to fight your wars.

47
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,530
And so that became a threat to the
status quo and that's when the law has

48
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:49,220
started to come out. Huh. It's interesting

49
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,620
cause he also got a lot of
people to get excited about it,

50
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,450
right? Yeah. But he got,

51
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:59,500
he took it away from it
being a, um, a medical

52
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,260
process and he made it about,

53
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,770
you know, enlightenment, but
in a kind of fluffy spirit,

54
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,590
joy away. Well, he made
it a big movement. Right.

55
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,620
I think you saw that he was probably
going to change the world with that

56
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:15,940
movement. Yeah, we kinda did. It
definitely had a big impact. You know,

57
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:17,830
all those people that took acid.
It's like,

58
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:22,831
think about if you really stop and think
about apple and you really look at the

59
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:26,590
fact that apple,

60
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,570
Steve Jobs said that taken acid was like
one of the greatest things that ever

61
00:03:30,571 --> 00:03:33,790
happened to him. Yeah. That was his,
it was famously talked about it.

62
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:35,711
And who knows what a,

63
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:40,711
what an impact that had on him deciding
to start apple and what would an impact

64
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:43,060
apple has had in the technology world.

65
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,850
Oh No.
Paul and talks about it in the book.

66
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:48,630
He draws a straight line from people
starting to take all this stuff because it

67
00:03:48,631 --> 00:03:50,580
was happening in Silicon Valley.

68
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:55,100
This whole psychedelic movement was like
right in that area. And he says that it,

69
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,630
you know, Bill, Bill Gates
apparently took it once,

70
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,680
but that all those guys were coming
in and they were, you know, they,

71
00:04:01,681 --> 00:04:06,090
there were these people that would lead.
There was a guy named,

72
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,480
um,
no Hubbard,

73
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,490
well Ron doss has mentioned also,

74
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,150
but there was guy named Hubbard
who was really like, you know,

75
00:04:15,151 --> 00:04:17,250
a corporate version of LSD.

76
00:04:17,251 --> 00:04:22,251
He was going to companies and he was
taking the CEOs of companies and taking

77
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:26,880
them in for these three
day drop acid experiences.

78
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,223
Wow.

79
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,170
Corporate acid. Well, they're
kind of doing that at burning
man. Oh, is that right?

80
00:04:34,171 --> 00:04:36,420
Some corporations go
to, I mean, not a lot,

81
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,470
but there's some cool companies who
go to burning man. Yeah. You know,

82
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,370
what's this Alfred?
Matthew Hubbard,

83
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,270
he's an early proponent of the drug LSD.
During the 1950s,

84
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:52,740
he is reputed to be the Johnny
Appleseed of Lsd and the first person to

85
00:04:52,741 --> 00:04:57,741
emphasize led lsds potential as a
visionary or trends in dental truck.

86
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,610
Okay.
But this guy had an a fucking life.

87
00:05:01,611 --> 00:05:03,670
Somebody's got to do a
movie about his life. He,

88
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:07,370
he was like working for the government.

89
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,230
He was a double agent. He was, uh,
while he was dropping acid. He was,

90
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,510
he, he started with nothing. No, I
think before, before, during and after.

91
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:22,540
He had like eight different careers
and he was like a spy and he bought it.

92
00:05:23,331 --> 00:05:27,080
He started with nothing and ended up with
like a bunch of airplanes that he was

93
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,250
leasing out,

94
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:32,000
became a millionaire and then spent it
all trying to educate people on Lsd.

95
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:35,870
He was worth like tens of millions of
dollars and he ended up broke at the end.

96
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,860
Wow. Yeah. Wow.

97
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,620
All for the LSD,

98
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,750
he believed in it so strongly that said
it was going to change the world and it

99
00:05:46,751 --> 00:05:50,290
would have, it may still now
there's, now it's coming back.

100
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,820
Well, there was a little hiccup or several
generations how to pass before people

101
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:59,150
started understanding that there's there,
there's a risk to everything.

102
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,190
There's a risk to a sports.

103
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:05,270
There's a risk to every fucking thing
you do driving your cars are at risk.

104
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,710
There's a risk with psychedelics,

105
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,930
but there's also a reward and I
think if you're going to be honest,

106
00:06:09,931 --> 00:06:12,650
do you have to look at both of them?
You have to look at the potential risk.

107
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,270
You have to look at the reward and they're
not looking at the reward to try this.

108
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:20,510
Too many people out there that are trying
to deny the reward and you've got to

109
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:24,440
find out why. And in this day
and age it might be a conspiracy,

110
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:28,880
it might be some pharmaceutical industry
that doesn't want it to be legal

111
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:31,190
because it would undermine their profits.
It might be,

112
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,780
it might be some law enforcement unions
that think it's a bad idea to make less

113
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:39,560
things illegal. It will take,
you know, prisons. Yeah.

114
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:41,250
It will take people away,
you know,

115
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,360
in terms of the amount of people that
they need for the job. It'll, you know,

116
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:49,380
which I think that's
another story. But when you,

117
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,233
you know,

118
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,620
and people look at that kind of
stuff and you look at like the,

119
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,800
the underlying sort of patterns
that we follow in this country,

120
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,170
you know,
the patterns that we like,

121
00:07:04,171 --> 00:07:08,010
are you happy or not happy
with the way things go?

122
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,320
The way things are run.

123
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:10,740
Okay.

124
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,160
In what sense? Just in
any sense. In all of it.

125
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,413
Yeah.

126
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:20,940
I trust that we do have the best system
out there and we challenge it every day.

127
00:07:22,451 --> 00:07:27,451
And I still think that we live in a place
where the tenants of our society are

128
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:31,360
in place for sure they
swing one way or the other,

129
00:07:31,361 --> 00:07:35,210
but I still believe in democracy.
And um,

130
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:40,230
I think the internet as an as an overall
thing has been positive for people

131
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,900
getting their voices out and for,
for information period

132
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,510
being distributed.
But the I,

133
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,960
the idea that we're faced
with that in this day and age,

134
00:07:49,961 --> 00:07:53,440
there's grown adults telling other grown
adults what they can and can't put in

135
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:56,480
their body. Yeah. And then not being
honest about the benefits. Right.

136
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,040
That's where it gets squirrely.
That's where the whole thing falls apart.

137
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,240
Like you're just a guy.

138
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,910
Like if you and I are the only two people
on the planet and he only came out,

139
00:08:03,911 --> 00:08:07,720
I'm not going to let you take
that acid. Like why? Well,

140
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:11,680
because it's illegal. Look, I wrote it
down. Can, can't take the acid. Right.

141
00:08:11,681 --> 00:08:14,140
Well that would be preposterous.
Yeah. But somehow or another,

142
00:08:14,141 --> 00:08:18,070
it works when there's a million people
that a person could tell you, you know,

143
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,940
if you're a fucking grown adult,
you can't tell me what I can take.

144
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,550
That's stupid. Yeah. If,

145
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:29,320
if you can't prove beyond a shadow of
a doubt that what I'm going to take is

146
00:08:29,321 --> 00:08:33,820
gonna fuck with you. If you can't
prove that, then stop. Yeah. Look,

147
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:34,990
if someone does something,

148
00:08:34,991 --> 00:08:38,260
if takes something and does somebody
take PCP and they've run phase first

149
00:08:38,261 --> 00:08:41,980
through a fucking seven 11 window
that's on them, it's on their actions.

150
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:45,250
It doesn't mean you shouldn't be able
to try PCP and I don't think you should

151
00:08:45,251 --> 00:08:49,330
try PCP. I think when enough enough people
smashed through windows and go crazy,

152
00:08:49,331 --> 00:08:51,100
you go, hey, maybe that's a
drug I should fucking avoid.

153
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,650
But that's how you find out about that.
Yeah.

154
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,140
You let grown adults make own decisions
and if you're the one who's making the

155
00:08:58,141 --> 00:08:59,730
decisions for all the grown adults,

156
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,950
you better have some real fucking
logic to what you're saying it.

157
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:07,540
And this is the same society that allows
the pharmaceuticals to peddle opiates

158
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,530
to people for the last 30 years saying
that it was the greatest thing you could

159
00:09:11,531 --> 00:09:12,250
do.

160
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:12,970
Exactly.

161
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,570
I think it's good that they make money
because they make medicine that helps a

162
00:09:16,571 --> 00:09:20,710
lot of people. They're not
all bad. I think in general,

163
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,370
pharmaceuticals have helped
people in tremendous ways,

164
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,850
but you can't deny that
if there's some way,

165
00:09:27,851 --> 00:09:32,680
shape or form that people are
influencing other people having access to

166
00:09:32,681 --> 00:09:37,390
beneficial things because it would
impact their profit line. That's,

167
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:41,950
that's evil. That's evil. You
have a lot of fucking money.

168
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:46,210
If you really going out of your way
to hire lobbyists to make sure that

169
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:50,530
mushrooms don't get on
the table, come on, man.

170
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,940
You're you are. You're a fucking
real problem. That's a real problem.

171
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,190
If you look at Yin and Yang,
this is,

172
00:09:57,191 --> 00:10:02,191
this is the opposing forces that were
battling to try to get total complete

173
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:06,430
freedom of your consciousness. These are
the opposing forces, their ignorance,

174
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,020
like these psychiatrists,

175
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:11,470
I guarantee you these psychiatrists
were worried about correlations between

176
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,300
psychotic episodes and psychedelic drug
use and they're worried about people

177
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,000
falling apart and they're right.
They're right.

178
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,160
This are the ones that wanted
to get it illegal debt, right.

179
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:25,450
It's like working on backflips
when there's a fucking
thin pad under you. Yeah.

180
00:10:25,451 --> 00:10:29,500
You could fall on your head. Yeah, you're
right. And we say, don't do gymnastics.

181
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,980
People fall in their head.
One out of 10 falls on their head.

182
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,920
You're not doing chimney, not
falling on your fucking head. Right.

183
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,750
It's the same thing.
It's the same thing.

184
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,770
So people worried about it that
don't really have experience in it.

185
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,640
I guarantee you most of
those psychiatrists just
didn't have experience in it.

186
00:10:45,641 --> 00:10:48,820
Or we're super cautious folks is if
they did have experiences with it,

187
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,190
maybe they try a little mushroom
dose and they'd be like,

188
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,210
wow, this is amazing. His
brain and also controlling,

189
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,740
um, you know, uh, s set and
setting, they keep talking about,

190
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,370
you know, and realizing
that the, the, you know,

191
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:09,620
occurrence of a psychotic episode is
so much lower when it's, you know,

192
00:11:09,621 --> 00:11:13,250
when you're, when it's being
dispensed the right way so much lower.

193
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,160
You ever been led through it by somebody.

194
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,180
Now when you did IOWASCA
was there like a guy, EMT,

195
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:25,580
Aubrey, my friend Aubrey acted as
a sign of like set the setting.

196
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,990
I'm in a way where it was, uh, you know,

197
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,930
I would say like spiritual,
like not

198
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,880
dot Riddick.
Not over the top,

199
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:40,020
but just announcing your intentions
that we're going into this,

200
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,660
we're going in this,
we're going to let go,

201
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,930
we're going to give thanks.

202
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:49,370
The all, all the spirits around
us and all the energy around us.

203
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:53,380
Just go into this with a good
intention. Give, be grateful.

204
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,410
Be uh,
go into it with gratitude.

205
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,460
And then the way it hits you,
it hits you like,

206
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,613
like a

207
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,630
infinite cyclone of geometric
patterns in impossible colors.

208
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,860
Just blasting in your brain
instantaneously and you like,

209
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:17,230
like going into it with the intention of
letting go is probably one of the best

210
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:21,490
pieces of advice you could give
people to uh, avoid a freakout, right?

211
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,730
Go with it, let it go.
Just let yourself go.

212
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,510
And it's what's trying to do is your ego
is trying to wrestle with this grizzly

213
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:32,950
bear. This enormous short face
bear on steroids is trying to,

214
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,400
your ego's trying to wrestle with
is impossible to resist force.

215
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,080
And that's what leads to a lot
of people freaking out. So Iga,

216
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:44,940
losing your ego is the
ultimate goal of it. Um,

217
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,220
I don't think anybody ever really
loses her ego. I think you,

218
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,520
you keep it in check.
You lose some of it.

219
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:56,020
You keep some of it because that's part
of your survival mechanism that the real

220
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:59,590
problem is like having a
healthy ego. You know, like, uh,

221
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,870
like if your wife looks good and she's
looking at herself in the mirror and she

222
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,540
was like, I look good. You
look fucking great. I do look
good. Like she feels good.

223
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,540
It feels everybody. That's ego, right?
You want to know you, you look good,

224
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:13,820
but it's not a bad ego. It's fun.
You know what I'm saying? Yeah.

225
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,620
The real problem is when it gets out of
control and toxic than it looked like

226
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,280
other people see it. They're like,
if you, you know, you see gross,

227
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,590
just gross behavior, grow
selfishness, you see that you'll go,

228
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:32,770
oh, that's the bad part of the
ego. That's what I'm saying. Yeah.

229
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,240
But the key is to know which is which,
and that's hard.

230
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,380
It's hard to know which is which.

231
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:41,500
Which one is the overwhelming
force inside your mind?

232
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,610
Which one is the one that's controlling
your consciousness and your behavior in

233
00:13:45,611 --> 00:13:47,230
which is, is it the good one, the bad one?

234
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,980
Is it the fun healthy one or is
it the one that is a, you know,

235
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,770
completely obsessed with
yourself and only yourself?

236
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,760
You don't know until you have these
experiences. And then the, the,

237
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,070
the nature of them gets exposed.

238
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:03,220
It like takes him down to the roots
and you start thinking about a,

239
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:05,770
where did all this come from?
Like where is it? Where's all,

240
00:14:05,771 --> 00:14:09,010
what's the source of all this? Like,
oh, there's a validation issue.

241
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,890
There's a this issue, there's a
trust issue, there's a, you know,

242
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,210
whatever the fuck it is.

243
00:14:13,211 --> 00:14:18,211
It's swirling out of that in this
unnatural form to create the negative

244
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,570
behavior that you are or

245
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,850
manifesting in your life like it.
All of it comes from something.

246
00:14:27,851 --> 00:14:31,140
And one of the things about
psychedelic experiences is it shut it,

247
00:14:31,141 --> 00:14:34,480
like it shuts the ego off for a second
and lets you stand outside of it and go

248
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,580
look with the things Dunia look at
this thing, things, grubs, and yeah,

249
00:14:38,581 --> 00:14:39,370
it doesn't work.
