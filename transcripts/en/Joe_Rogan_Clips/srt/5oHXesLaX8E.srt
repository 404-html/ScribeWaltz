1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,870
But yes,

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:05,760
but I would say it's still more hardcore
than the average place for sure. It's,

3
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:10,761
I mean that's that it is so open in in
terms of how people decide to structure

4
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:15,900
their camps.
Some people have very little sparring.

5
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:18,480
Like cowboy was telling me he
does he Harley's bars at all.

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,660
I mean he does just technical
work and pad work. He's like,

7
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:24,360
I already know how to fight. He wasn't
used to be completely opposite though,

8
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:27,000
right? Yeah. I used to spar, spar,
spar, spar and then we switched it up.

9
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,350
That's when he started doing much better
he said and he said it really made a

10
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:34,710
big difference because he was going
into fights damaged because you know,

11
00:00:34,711 --> 00:00:35,544
he's such a,

12
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,530
he's so hardcore himself that sparring
with him ultimately must become more

13
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:43,260
hardcore cause just he's
such a fucking wild man.

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,070
Robbie Lawler did something similar as
one thing, but I think Tony Ferguson was

15
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,620
no sparring. Yep. Tony had no, no sparring
in preparation for his last fight.

16
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,200
That's when I saw him in
the post fight interview.

17
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,540
What makes sense about
that with him though,

18
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:00,390
is that he was coming off an
in catastrophic knee injury.

19
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:04,530
I mean he literally tore his ligament
off the bone and had to have it put back

20
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:08,220
on and then six months later he
was fighting. That's incredible.

21
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,150
This is not a whole lot of human beings
like back guy. Yeah. He's a real freak.

22
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,900
That level of grit determination to come
back from that injury and to perform

23
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:19,530
like he did the pedis. Yeah. That was
my favorite fight of the night. Yeah.

24
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:23,440
I really enjoyed it. I was bummed out.
The pedis hurt his hand cause his head is,

25
00:01:23,441 --> 00:01:26,640
it's not going forward. No, he
doesn't mean he never gets tired.

26
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,470
That's the crazy thing about Tony.

27
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,010
You know an Eddie Bravo does his camps
with them up in big bear and he says it's

28
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:33,960
nuts, man. They do hill sprints,

29
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,340
everybody else's exhausted and Tony's
just lapping them this running back up.

30
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:41,110
I mean he's just never added gas.
He,

31
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:45,390
he'll work out six hours hard a day.
And on top of that,

32
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:50,250
what he does is he gets there, they rent
a house and then he builds his own gym.

33
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,010
So they'll have like a
house that they rent.

34
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:57,090
He'll Matt up the living room and then
he'll go outside. He'll put up a wing,

35
00:01:57,091 --> 00:02:01,860
Chung dummy, don't hang heavy
bags. He does it all week check wt.

36
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,060
Yeah man mean he, he actually use
wing Chung and the fight with Pettis,

37
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,670
he trapped his hand and
hit him with an elbow once.

38
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,340
And I remember watching it going like,
Holy Shit,

39
00:02:11,341 --> 00:02:14,640
he just use wind Chung inside the cage.
Like it works.

40
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,620
Like if you really know your shit,

41
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,130
he trapped his hand and then came right
over the top with an album and I went

42
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,770
look at that shit cause he's
always practicing it. You know,

43
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,860
he's always practicing Kung Fu
but he's a very, very unusual guy.

44
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:31,710
Like there's all this talk about a Connor
rematch because financially that would

45
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:35,430
be a fantastic fight, right? Financially.
But when you look at what happened,

46
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:36,990
that was a dominant victory.

47
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,830
I mean there was one round where
Connor did pretty good the third round.

48
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,300
Other than that could be
just sort of dominated him.

49
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,240
I mean dropped him in the second,

50
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,140
beat the fucking shit out of him in the
fourth and the third was around where

51
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:51,330
Connor did pretty good because
most of it was standing up.

52
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,530
I think he won that round,
right?

53
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,890
That was at the first round game you've
ever lost. Yeah, I think there was. Yeah.

54
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,320
But I mean it wasn't the one it like
running away. It wasn't like that.

55
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:02,830
He blasted him in the body, had him
hurt and there was nothing like that.

56
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,640
It was just the edge to him.
It's hard to make, I mean,

57
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:10,240
I guess you could say that's the same
thing that's sort of happened in the Nate

58
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,390
Diaz fight. Then Connor came back and
won the rematch. So this is the argument.

59
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:17,890
The argument is Connor was Rusty's
advocates for two years. He gets back in,

60
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,590
let's do a read and then
financially Jesus Christ,

61
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:22,090
I mean it was the biggest
fight of all time.

62
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,050
They're saying is above 2.4
million pay per view buys,

63
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,410
which is fucking bananas.
Yeah, that's, that's huge.

64
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,370
So if it's bigger than that,
and then they,

65
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,060
if they could talk people into a rematch,
I get it, but I don't want to see that.

66
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,060
I want to see Tony. I want to
see Tony, Tony [inaudible]. Yeah.

67
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,610
And the could be the suspension.
Let them give a little money to symbolic.

68
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,900
What's the one I might take on?
It would keep, you know, this,

69
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,320
the whole thing is fucked. It's not
professional. Right. It shouldn't happen,

70
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,190
but neither should people be fucking
screaming shit at him while he's fighting.

71
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:00,961
You know?
And,

72
00:04:00,961 --> 00:04:04,780
and I guess that was going on the
entire time he was apparently having,

73
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:08,470
like Dylan Dennis was in Connor's
corner was screaming shit.

74
00:04:08,471 --> 00:04:12,400
It could be while the fight was going
on, which I guess gets annoying. Yeah.

75
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:13,660
You said the new angle,

76
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:19,240
there's a new angle of video where
it could bebes Russian manager. Um,

77
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:21,550
as,
as Connor is tapping,

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,480
he comes right behind Dennis and slaps
him on the back like three or four times.

79
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,500
I did see that. Yeah. Kind of instigating
something. Yeah, there's that.

80
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:34,510
And then someone said could be a, that
Connor swung first, which is true,

81
00:04:34,511 --> 00:04:34,961
but could be,

82
00:04:34,961 --> 00:04:38,530
but already gone over the
cage and someone's going to
guide us coming at him and

83
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:42,680
Connor swung at him, but I think it
was already chaos at that point. Yeah.

84
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,220
You know,
it's all very unfortunate,

85
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,720
but what happened really
not. No one got hurt. Yeah.

86
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,190
You know what I mean? Connor got in.
Anybody down there? I mean, did you,

87
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,560
did you feel at all like,
oh man,

88
00:04:56,561 --> 00:04:59,560
this rights coming towards me or
anything like that? Did it spread around?

89
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,750
I am so I'm so used to beat the shit
out of each other. It's like, oh,

90
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:06,490
now they're beating the shit
out of each other over here.

91
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,980
It didn't feel any more dangerous.

92
00:05:11,981 --> 00:05:16,120
I was hoping the chairs wouldn't start
flying and then it wouldn't get too crazy

93
00:05:16,121 --> 00:05:17,440
and I was really,
really,

94
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:21,850
really hoping that someone wouldn't do
something stupid and hurt someone to the

95
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:24,520
point where they would get kicked
out of the UFC or suspended.

96
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,790
But that might be the case with that
one gentleman. What does his name, Ba,

97
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,510
what is his name? And My fucking should
I should check my Instagram cause it's,

98
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,620
it's filled with free.
Zoomba

99
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:41,260
yeah. Can Be, it's like a training
partner. Yeah. I got fired.

100
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,840
I got fired.

101
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:48,841
His fight with the artist was supposed
to be with Artem and not a bad idea to

102
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,080
cancel that fight because it's so close
to this and obviously it's going to be

103
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:58,260
so, so charged up. Let
me find homeboys. Yeah.

104
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,440
They just moved to [inaudible] to fight
Michael Johnson, I think. Ooh. Hm. Uh,

105
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,480
there'll be a good fight for it. Yeah.
That'd be a real good fight. Yeah.
