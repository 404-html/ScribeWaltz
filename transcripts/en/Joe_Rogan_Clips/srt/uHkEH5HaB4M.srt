00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,880
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,780
It's unbelievable how much I thought about
this a lot this last year through the

3
00:00:06,781 --> 00:00:08,400
election,
but he's like unbelievable.

4
00:00:08,401 --> 00:00:12,820
How much like that football team
dynamic is just the whole thing. Yeah.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,910
It's like human beings love to get
into a stadium, be like red team,

6
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:22,140
blue team, identify with one team
and lose their freaking minds.

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,770
Literally lose their minds and that's
when they know it's meaningless when they

8
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:29,430
know it's just about a ball crossing a
line. And this is, this has absolutely no,

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,490
we'll still bring God into it. We'll
bring that team into it. All these,

10
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,610
and again you see like with this Trump
thing now that he just stepped on,

11
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,090
me and Jamie were joking around before
we started like a where it's like he,

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,420
he liked threatened nuclear war and
insulted Steph curry in in one thought I'd

13
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:48,580
ever, everyone in America is like,
excuse me, what was that second excuse?

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,770
What it's like and,

15
00:00:50,771 --> 00:00:54,690
and both sides like this is just
what gets them interested. Well,

16
00:00:54,691 --> 00:00:57,810
we are a gossip country now.
Like 100% officially.

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,840
Like what we'd like is a squabble between
the leader of the free world who was a

18
00:01:02,941 --> 00:01:07,050
reality star and some of the best
basketball players that have ever lived.

19
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:10,650
Like oh shit hits on flip ball players.

20
00:01:10,651 --> 00:01:14,820
I mean Lebron James is making videos
about the president of being a douchebag.

21
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,070
He's making videos about
all these different people
like expressing their right

22
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:22,920
to free speech. I saw one
of the tweets that he, uh,

23
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,020
he tweeted out at the
president where it was like,

24
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:26,790
just kind of like a broken English tweet.

25
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:30,360
Like he used the word ain't a lot
in it and it's just him verse Trump.

26
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:31,830
And I just had a moment where I was like,

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,190
so this is where the national conversation
is at now. Like, do you remember,

28
00:01:35,191 --> 00:01:37,560
I just remember watching like a William F.

29
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,630
Buckley versus Gore v down
debates and you're like,

30
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,620
how fucking retarded has
our country gotten? Have you
seen those? The documentary?

31
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,610
Yeah. It's amazing. Really interesting.
If you haven't seen it focuses on Netflix.

32
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:52,550
What is it called? Something I
don't remember. Bitter rivals. Yeah.

33
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,660
No, that's something that's
called bitter rivals.

34
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:59,661
That might have been a UFC event back
in the early two thousands [inaudible]

35
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,630
Sylvia, three best of enemies.
Best of enemies. Thank you.

36
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,500
Your children did the stupid pattern.
I don't know.

37
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,540
54 obliteration.

38
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:19,660
Okay.
