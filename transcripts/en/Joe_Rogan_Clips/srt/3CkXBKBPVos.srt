1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
Out of Iraq and Afghanistan. It's a waste
of time. It's so stupid. Why are we the,

2
00:00:03,331 --> 00:00:05,940
we need to rebuild our own country.
And you know,

3
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:08,280
those are tweets where I read that
and I go, I totally agree with that.

4
00:00:08,281 --> 00:00:12,150
Donald Trump 100% but then the other
half the time when he was on the campaign

5
00:00:12,151 --> 00:00:14,880
trail, he spoke about how, you know,

6
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:17,790
we need to bomb isis to smithereens
and we need to wipe them out.

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,370
And those things are
kind of contradictory.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,790
Either you bring your troops home and you,
you know,

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,590
didn't you think he would be able
to fix everything really quickly?

10
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,520
Wasn't that one that one of his premises?
Typical Trump, you know, bloviating like,

11
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,110
I'm going to be tremendous.
I'm going to be amazing.

12
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:34,860
It's gonna be the best job you've ever
seen over. It's not a bad impression,

13
00:00:34,861 --> 00:00:38,550
but you got to change the tone
because I'm not doing the full hand.

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,420
You doing good movement. The movements
I have is the movement. Joseph Rogan.

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,710
Can I call you Joseph?

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,280
What did you think personally when you
saw Kanye with that insane and ask you

17
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:55,200
about that too. Bipolar ramp. Yeah.
I feel kind of bad for him. I do.

18
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,730
And I'm not,
and I want to be clear,

19
00:00:56,731 --> 00:01:00,030
I'm really not saying that as a partisan
thing because even if Bernie Sanders

20
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:03,060
was president and Kanye West was in
the office saying the exact same stuff,

21
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:06,680
I'd still be like, Whoa, what is going
on here? Yeah. Yeah. Did you burn?

22
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:08,040
It helps them do it too.

23
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:11,210
Because remember when he left those
black lives matter chick type to remember

24
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,030
that. I remember that cost
him, but he just stepped aside.

25
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,660
That really did cost him. You think
so? Yes. Yeah. People do. You can't do,

26
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,140
you can't just take the microphone
away from someone you know.

27
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,910
So here's an interesting question.

28
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:28,670
Do you think this helped Donald Trump
at all with black voters having Kanye do

29
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,480
that, but how much a good number.
Really? You think so too? Yeah, I do.

30
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,510
I don't know. I don't know
because I feel like there's a,

31
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:39,870
Kanye West has been disinvited from a lot
of cookouts now as a result of what he

32
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:43,590
did with Trump. Jamie's on black Twitter.
Jamie says, not at all. From what I read,

33
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:46,710
it did not in black Twitter.

34
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,410
So this response has been very negative.

35
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:51,900
So it was con Kanye is
really almost in a sense,

36
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,820
blowing his own reputation on this. I
guess that to said, I don't think so. No.

37
00:01:56,821 --> 00:02:01,821
I think everyone who's a fan of Kanye
west who's seen him blow up on Jimmy

38
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,960
Kimmel and blow up on all these different
people that have criticized him, he's,

39
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,780
he's obviously got mental health issues.

40
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,250
When he went on that rant, I think it was
in San Jose, is that a concert? He said,

41
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:17,620
I didn't vote, but if I did vote, he
was, I would have voted on Trump. Yup.

42
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:22,440
And everybody went and then he wound up
going into a mental hospital after that.

43
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,920
Oh Wow. Checked into a mental
hospital and then canceled his tour.

44
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,660
I remember that.
I do remember that.

45
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:30,540
That was because he couldn't handle
the criticism. It's part of it.

46
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:35,460
And also part of it, he's legitimately
mentally ill. I mean, look,

47
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,700
he didn't marry that lady and be a part
of that family because he's thinking

48
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:42,650
straight. He's got some problems. There's
something wrong with them. Yeah. You know,

49
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,270
he's a genius in terms
of music. He's, he's,

50
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,170
he's fantastic at creating
beats and songs and hooks.

51
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,390
He knows what the fuck he's doing there,
but he,

52
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,380
he's got a problem and
you hear it when he rants,

53
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,800
when he's ranting and when he's
talking about Ford making dope cars,

54
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:03,460
we don't use the word dope cause we only
use words like magnificent and positive

55
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:05,890
words like he's,
he's making,

56
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:10,420
he's listening to himself and jerking
off to the noises that are coming out of

57
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:11,590
his own mouth.
I love,

58
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,020
I loved when he said to the reporter
when the report or pushed back on them a

59
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:16,840
little bit, he's like, you
just asked me a question. No,

60
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:21,730
you can't do that because this is like
taste and a fine wine. It's complex. Yeah,

61
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,850
exactly. I thought that was really funny.
My read on him is sensical. He's he,

62
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,960
I think part of what he's doing
is that he's a contrarian.

63
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,640
And when you are in a place like Hollywood
and you're there all the time and

64
00:03:32,641 --> 00:03:35,380
you're always surrounded by
people who are anti Trump,

65
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:39,380
I think there's something about just this
knee jerk reactionary feeling of like,

66
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,350
like, no, I'm not with you guys.

67
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:44,860
I'm different and I'm special as a
result of being different. So I'm a,

68
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:46,720
I'm a contrarian and I'm
going to disagree with you.

69
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,820
And then I also think there's narcissism
in the sense that he looks at Trump and

70
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:55,060
he really sees himself in Trump and that
everybody laughed at Trump when he said,

71
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:56,980
I'm going to run for president.
I'm going to win.

72
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,200
And if you remember a few years ago,
Kanye West said,

73
00:03:59,201 --> 00:04:01,270
I'm going to run for president.
And everybody was laughing at him.

74
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,560
Wasn't even a few years ago. It
was recently. Yeah. He and uh,

75
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,970
what the fuck's on guys
named Piers Morgan, right?
Right into it on, on Twitter.

76
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,140
Who said you're talking to your future
president? That's what Kanye says.

77
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,860
Oh my God. Maybe it was
Harvey Levin. He said it too.

78
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,790
You're talking to a future president
actually dislike piers Morgan more than I

79
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:25,960
dislike Kanye West.
Kanye on that one.

80
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,180
I think Connie's ill. Oh really?
Do. And I know he's been medicated.

81
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,040
I mean remember when he was all
Chubby and he's on his medication,

82
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,840
he got fat and apparently he got off
his medication and there are a lot of

83
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:38,531
people,
by the way,

84
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:42,880
who would hear the point you made and B
would be really angry at the fact that

85
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:47,020
you think that he's mentally ill even
though I think that's a problem I've seen.

86
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,570
I've seen it all my Twitter, I've
seen it on my Twitter. People saying,

87
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,740
oh it's just a cheap partisan hacky point.

88
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:54,430
Oh it's not because he's
admittedly mentally ill.

89
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,430
I mean he's been in say that and the
thing he said, I was diagnosed bipolar.

90
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,340
Institutionalized.
Yeah.

91
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,820
He spent time in a mental
hospital for being mentally ill.

92
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,850
And when you listen to him brand,
this is just my opinion.

93
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:12,210
That is not the ravings of someone who's
carefully considering the implications

94
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:17,290
of each word they're saying and thinking
about how to express themselves in a

95
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:21,130
way that's going to portray
some sort of a clear,

96
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:24,400
cohesive message. This is
not, he's not what he's doing.

97
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,000
What he's doing is jerking off.
He's just jerking off with his mouth.

98
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,340
I'm not kidding. It's just,
it's just like, let me get
it out. This is a fine wine.

99
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,260
You know, we gotta, we gotta
make the dope. It's caused,

100
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:36,930
why can't fly by the
dump was cause you know,

101
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,950
did you hear what he
said in that same thing?

102
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,330
The reason why we got to help Larry
Hoover is because in a different universe

103
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,490
there are alternate universes.
I am him.

104
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,520
I don't think that's correct.
So song lyrics to a song.

105
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:54,430
Was it saying he says that when
he's off his Lexapro? Yeah. Oh No,

106
00:05:54,431 --> 00:05:58,790
you ain't see nothing crazier than
this Nigga. When he off his Lexapro.

107
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,890
Remember that time in Mexico?
Remember the law that last time,

108
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:08,840
the episode asking me, why the hell out
texting code four times just to say,

109
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:11,630
don't text me Ho told you four times.

110
00:06:11,631 --> 00:06:15,230
Don't text me how and we
Finna lose all self control.

111
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:18,290
But you ain't Finna raise
in your voice at me.

112
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,320
Especially when we end the
Giuseppe still modern day Socrates.

113
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,160
Larry is, man, it's lit, but I love that,

114
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,060
that nothing crazier.
Then when he's off his Lexapro,

115
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:36,690
oh my God, yeah. I do kind of feel bad
even though this is such a, you know,

116
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,970
like a side show type thing because I
mean the state of the country so weird

117
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:44,780
that beach simply because of his
celebrity and the fact that the mainstream

118
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:46,670
media doesn't know how to
keep their eye on the ball.

119
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,170
You never know who can become president.
It could be somebody like Kanye.
