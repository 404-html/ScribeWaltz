1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,900
Well.
So taking the red pill on,

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,920
on freewill makes you much more
forgiving of a lot of this stuff.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,480
Yeah. Cause you see just
everyone is an open system. Uh,

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,370
no one authored themselves, right.
One created the themselves. No one,

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,910
no one can directly regulate the effect
that of every influence that they had or

6
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:28,100
didn't have. You know, it's like you,

7
00:00:28,101 --> 00:00:32,820
you are the totality of
what brought you here.

8
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:37,560
I mean the universe has sort of just push
you to this point in time and the only

9
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:42,561
thing you've got is your brain
and it states and that is,

10
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,320
that is based on your genes and the
totality of environmental influences. You,

11
00:00:47,321 --> 00:00:49,140
your,
you had a system have,

12
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,460
have had working on you
up until this moment.

13
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,960
And so the next words that come out of
your mouth are part of that process.

14
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:03,190
Now, the peep. Some people find
this to be, uh, uh, you know,

15
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,770
frankly demoralizing picture or
they think, well, okay, well I'm,

16
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,660
you're telling me, telling me I'm just a
robot. But you're a robot that is open,

17
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:14,970
continuously open to influence,

18
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,840
to influence of either internally
based on its own processes.

19
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:21,240
I mean there's like there's top
down control of, of, you know,

20
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:24,540
you're the executive function
in the brain to your, you know,

21
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:26,490
your emotional life say,

22
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:31,260
and you're continually open
to the influences of culture,

23
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:31,850
right?
You know,

24
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:35,700
the cultures as operating system that
you're interacting with in each moment and

25
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,470
whatever's getting in can change you
in radical ways very quickly. I mean,

26
00:01:40,471 --> 00:01:45,471
there's no telling how much you can
change on the basis of one new idea coming

27
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:49,590
your way right now.
I would argue that the process of change,

28
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:54,591
I mean if I say something that changes
your view on anything that's not evidence

29
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:58,470
of freewill, that is evidence of just
yet more causality. I mean, you don't,

30
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,540
you don't pick the changes
that come your way. If I,

31
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:03,750
if I get you to see something that
you didn't see a moment before,

32
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,530
you're not responsible for the fact that
you didn't see it a moment before and

33
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:09,480
you're not responsible for
the fact that you now see it.

34
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:13,390
It's just like the dominoes just
kept falling. Right. Right. Um,

35
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,740
but it does give you this a
far more patient sense of,

36
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,330
um, one, just it just, you know,

37
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,950
all the causes and conditions
that, that have created, the, this,

38
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,570
this odious behavior. You're,
you're, you're now disposed
to react to in the world,

39
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:36,760
right? Like, like you can,
everything on some level is,

40
00:02:36,761 --> 00:02:40,140
is more of a force of nature than it
is something that you need to take

41
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:42,660
personally. It's like if there's
a hurricane blowing outside,

42
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,090
we don't respond to it the same
way we would respond to, you know,

43
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,000
al Qaeda and dropping a bomb on
us. Right? It could, it might,

44
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:54,930
it might create the same amount
of damage, but in, in the,

45
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:59,800
in the latter case where
we have an identifiable, an
identifiable agent, right?

46
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,690
We feel like,
okay,

47
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:04,870
now we're in the presence of human
evil and we have to go kill these

48
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:07,300
motherfuckers right now we
may have to kill them, right?

49
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:11,720
Because that may be the only way of, of,
of putting out this, this, you know, uh,

50
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,970
s stopping the damage there.
They're committed to causing, but,

51
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,300
and we would kill hurricanes if we could
kill them, right? I mean, we would,

52
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:21,370
you know,
we would nullify them,

53
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:24,520
but the feeling we have in
both cases is very different.

54
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,600
The feeling you have attributing ultimate
authorship to a person's behavior is

55
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:34,540
super, uh, narrow, uh,

56
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,790
psychologically and ethically. And it's,
you know, the feeling of vengeance, right?

57
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,530
Like, like you don't, you, you don't,

58
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:46,480
you have this feeling of vengeance is so
natural to get triggered in response to

59
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:47,314
a person.

60
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,370
It's not natural and response to a
wild animal who may have done something

61
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:53,990
terrible. Right? I mean,
like, you would like, I mean,

62
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:59,020
there've been examples of this where
people have taken vengeance on animals and

63
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:04,021
it just looks like a kind
of moral dysfunction on the
part of the people who did

64
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:06,820
it. I mean, there's a famous
picture of a, an elephant.

65
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:10,100
They got hung from a railroad crane, I
think back in the 20s right? So like,

66
00:04:10,101 --> 00:04:13,600
if this is a circus, elephant
escaped and it ran, you know,

67
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,500
you just rampage through the streets
and trampled, let you know a few people.

68
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,560
And the, and the people in the, in
the town, I don't know where this was,

69
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:21,820
it was a Baltimore or someplace.

70
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,730
We're so outraged that they've decided
to lynch the elephant, right? Like,

71
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,110
and yet that's,

72
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,710
there's something uncanny about that
sort of misappropriation of agency to an

73
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:33,850
elephant. But what, what is it,

74
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,210
what is a mistreated circus elephant
going to do when he gets out and is

75
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:38,830
terrified and he's trying
to get away from people?

76
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:39,910
It's going to trample a few people.

77
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,520
So we have a very different set of
books we keep ethically for humans.

78
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,990
And
some of it's understandable,

79
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:51,130
some of it's inevitable,

80
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,790
but a lot of it gives us moral
illusions that we don't need to have.

81
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,730
And it gives a, it gives us a kind of, uh,

82
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,510
just an inability to take stock of all
the variables that are actually guiding

83
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:06,280
human behavior and react to them and
mitigate them and disincentivize them

84
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:08,980
intelligently. I mean,
punishment makes sense.

85
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,180
Not because people really,
really deserve at bottom,

86
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:16,690
whatever their punishments are,
it doesn't make sense in a,

87
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:21,210
in a retro retributive paradigm,
it makes sense if,

88
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,300
if it's the,

89
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,130
the best tool to discourage
dangerous behavior.

90
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,150
Uh, and it works, right? So
it's like, you know, if you're,

91
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,600
if you're going to punish people
for things they can't control,

92
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,020
well that's stupid,
right? Because it's you,

93
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,630
as much as you punish them
that you're not gonna,

94
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,080
you're not gonna moderate the behavior.

95
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,460
So you have to punish people for things
that are actually under voluntary

96
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:49,360
control.
And it only,

97
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:54,361
it only makes sense if it's
the only tool to do the job.

98
00:05:55,061 --> 00:05:57,160
And if the moment you had,
I mean to this is,

99
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,840
I may have brought this up last
time we spoke about free will,

100
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,500
but this is really,
they sort of reductio ad absurdum of,

101
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:06,080
of where most people are on this topic.

102
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,400
The moment we really understand
human evil at the level of the brain,

103
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:12,860
the moment we understand
psychopathy say, which is, I mean,

104
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:14,390
maybe that's not the totality of evil,

105
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:16,700
but that's certainly
center of the Bullseye.

106
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,560
Once we understand psychopathy is a
neurological condition that's governed by

107
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:24,170
genes and environment and we can,

108
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,220
we can actually intrude at the
level of the brain to mitigate it.

109
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,280
So like psychopathy becomes a
disease, right? It becomes a,

110
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,590
a an injuries syndrome, right? That
we can fix. And let's say it's,

111
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,140
let's say it's a very simple
fix. I'll say it's a pill, right?

112
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:43,430
Let's say it's just a neurotransmitter
imbalance in the presence of that

113
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,533
breakthrough,

114
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,430
we will feel very differently
about that species of human evil.

115
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,800
We will not judge it in
the same way will it?

116
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,940
Because what will happen is you'll give
people the pill and they'll say, fuck,

117
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,870
I can't believe I was that
dangerous asshole. Like,
like the thank you for like,

118
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:00,441
like I,

119
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:05,300
I'm as horrified by who I was
before you cured me as you were.

120
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,650
Right?
And so it'll be so,

121
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,380
so suck psychopathy and the presence of
a cure for it would look much more like

122
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:17,381
diabetes than it looks like evil in the
present case and people aren't imagining

123
00:07:17,721 --> 00:07:20,000
what it would like.
What would it be like to be there?

124
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:24,260
What it would be like to actually
fully understand the under underlying

125
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:26,800
neurophysiology here and actually
have something. I mean it's,

126
00:07:26,801 --> 00:07:30,980
there's no guarantee we'll be able to,
to, uh, deal with it in a simple way,

127
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:35,610
but it's certainly possible.
Um, and I mean the,

128
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,630
the classic example is just, you know,
like the Charles Whitman example where,

129
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:41,630
you know, you have a brain tumor
that's causing this aberrant behavior.

130
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,430
In that case, everyone, everyone
sees, okay, this is not evil.

131
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:51,440
This is a brain tumor.
That's the tower shooter game back in 64.

132
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:55,190
I think. Um, and so,

133
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:00,020
but in the same way that a brain,
tuber tumors exculpatory there,

134
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,810
I think a full understanding of the,

135
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,130
the underlying neurology
would be exculpatory again.

136
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:10,160
It doesn't mean you in the meantime,
you know, before we get there,

137
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:13,540
we have obviously we have to lock up
dangerous people if there's no way to,

138
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,930
to help them.
But the more we see the causes,

139
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,340
the more we view,

140
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,020
we view this in terms
of just sheer bad luck,

141
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,520
right? Like, like there are,

142
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,140
there are people who when they're
adults are quintessentially evil,

143
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,220
who we've, who and they provoke the
greatest feeling of vengeance from us.

144
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,630
But if you just walk back there timeline,
you recognize it at a certain,

145
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,910
they were four years old at one point,
right?

146
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,530
They were the four year old who was
destined to become this terrible person.

147
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,460
It's an unlucky four year old,
you know? And so at what point,

148
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:51,800
where's the bright line that says,
okay,

149
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:54,980
here's the point where it's appropriate.

150
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,790
Just hate this person and
feel no compassion. And on
the other side of this line,

151
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,430
you should just feel compassion
because this person's unlucky.

152
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,880
There is no such line and a complete
understanding of this lifeline in,

153
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,980
in scientific terms would obliterate
any line you think you have.

154
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:18,120
Right? It would just be this
cascade of causation. And you know,

155
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:20,530
adding randomness to the picture
doesn't help. Right? It's just,

156
00:09:20,531 --> 00:09:21,870
it's the randomness is just,
you know,

157
00:09:21,871 --> 00:09:25,620
somebody is in your brain rolling dice
and influencing your behavior that way.

158
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,350
Well that's, that doesn't give you the,
the freewill people think they have.

159
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:31,050
So there isn't,
there's a,

160
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:34,650
ironically there is what seems

161
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:40,300
on some level deflationary
of the, of the, the,

162
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:41,660
the,

163
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:46,660
the Gravitas of the human spirit for
people opens the door to at least in my

164
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:47,821
view,

165
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:52,821
a far more ethical and tolerant and
patient and understanding view of,

166
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:58,530
of, you know, human failings and,
and human frailty and, and just,

167
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:02,880
and then at that point you can just have
a conversation about what's pragmatic,

168
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:05,510
what works, what helps
people change. Like in this,

169
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,410
this person over here who's
doing terrible things,

170
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,910
is there something we can do to make him
a better person? Well, if there is less,

171
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,650
do that without all the judgment.

172
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,840
Wouldn't it be amazing if that's how
we treated these public shaming events?

173
00:10:18,841 --> 00:10:23,010
Like wouldn't, wouldn't it be amazing if
we gave someone an opportunity to say,

174
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:28,020
this is, this is what I did, this
is how awful I feel about this.

175
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,290
I would never do that again. I'm a
different person. That was 20 years ago,

176
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:35,720
whatever it was and, and have
everybody join in. Hey, um,

177
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,230
anyone could be you. Thank you for
being honest about who you are now.

178
00:10:40,231 --> 00:10:41,550
Thank you for evolving.

179
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:44,520
Thank you for expressing yourself in a
way that maybe other people who have also

180
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:45,840
committed,
really,

181
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,920
I'm just unsavory or just
unfortunate things in the past.

182
00:10:51,871 --> 00:10:52,980
Unfortunate acts in the past,

183
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:57,150
they can feel relieved by the fact that
you've grown and evolved to become a

184
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,070
better person. Yeah. And that you're a,

185
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,280
you're a different thing now and you are
the product of all of your experiences.

186
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,870
You're not,
you're not this one thing.

187
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,900
You're not stuck in who you
were when you were 16 years old.

188
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,530
If you were Marky mark and you hit that
guy with a stick, whatever, you know,

189
00:11:10,531 --> 00:11:13,950
whatever he did, you didn't, you're
not stuck in that spot forever.

190
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:16,080
These don't Mar,
it's not a scarlet letter.

191
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:20,040
It's not a mark on your forehead
that you keep for life. Yeah. I mean,

192
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,230
the thing about the Liam Neeson incident,

193
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:26,590
which I find so interesting is
that there's a case where, I mean,

194
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:31,050
what he's revealing about himself is,
is pretty amazing, right? It's like,

195
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,350
it's like he just decided, okay, we,

196
00:11:34,351 --> 00:11:39,090
we need a truth and Reconciliation
Commission for who I used to be. Right.

197
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:41,250
You know? And, uh,

198
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,540
just volunteered this and
for me like, like, you know,

199
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,350
I don't actually understand
that state of mind.

200
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:51,930
I mean there are many ab or in
states of mind that I can understand.

201
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:55,540
I certainly understand what it's like to,
to want to harm somebody and to,

202
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:59,590
you know, to feel vengeance and all that.
But the instrumental violence piece,

203
00:11:59,591 --> 00:12:02,650
I don't understand. I've
never felt like, okay,

204
00:12:02,651 --> 00:12:06,130
this type of person wronged
me or someone close to me.

205
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,480
So any time any person of that
type we'll do right like that.

206
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:15,500
But that is such a problem. The
world over in human history. Yes.

207
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,773
That it is,

208
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:22,140
it is just fascinating
ethically for someone of his
stature to reveal that about

209
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:27,220
himself. And he put it in terms of,
of of honor. I mean it was like a,

210
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,420
it was an honor.
I mean this is one,

211
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:32,320
this is w w what is so dysfunctional
about honor culture, right? This is what,

212
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,280
this is what we see more in the south
than anywhere else in the country.

213
00:12:36,281 --> 00:12:40,330
And this is what you see
basically everywhere you go
in the Middle East is this,

214
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:45,370
and this is what Islam inculcates to
a degree that's fairly unmatched in,

215
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,660
in its community.
This notion of honor is,

216
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:54,900
does link up with this tendency to find
satisfaction in instrumental violence.

217
00:12:56,921 --> 00:13:00,520
Like when you, when you try to
run that software on my brain,

218
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,190
that just looks like madness,
right?

219
00:13:03,191 --> 00:13:08,191
The idea that any other person will do
right of a certain type that's just,

220
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:15,280
you know, I don't read, that
resonates not at all. Right? And so,

221
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,473
um,

222
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,760
it's just damn interesting and the fact
that the lesson being taken from this

223
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:24,940
seems to be,
this is,

224
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:30,270
this should be the end of your career
for having talked about this in the way.

225
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,110
And again,

226
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:35,440
I apologize if there's some part of the
story that I've gotten wrong or I'm not

227
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:36,700
missing or missing,

228
00:13:36,701 --> 00:13:41,620
but it seemed to me that he was
always counting this in the,

229
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,610
the horror and amazement
appropriate to the disclosure.

230
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:50,020
Like he can't believe he was inhabiting
this date of loss of consciousness. And,

231
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,700
you know, it's just an amazing thing
to reveal about yourself. Uh, so, yeah.

232
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:57,100
And I'm sure he regrets every
second of it. Yeah. And that's,

233
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,620
that's the wrong fucking
punchline, right? You know,

234
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,860
the thing that should happen is

235
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:08,770
someone with a lot to lose
should be able to say, you know,

236
00:14:08,771 --> 00:14:12,850
how ugly a human mind can be. This
is an experience I had, right?

237
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,670
This is who I was,
and you know,

238
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:18,190
how much I have to live for
and how much I have to lose.

239
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:22,000
We have to talk about this kind of mania.

240
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:25,210
They can get Hamid on a human brain.
Right? Right. And we see this eight,

241
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:29,050
every time you open the paper, you see
someone in the grip of this kind of thing.

242
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:33,940
Right. Even happened to me. Right. I think
it's an amazing conversation to start,

243
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:37,850
and the fact that the result
is just, you know, and,

244
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,950
and an auto de fe, uh, is,
is a, is the problem. We're,

245
00:14:42,951 --> 00:14:45,340
we're trying to fight our way through it.
