1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,360
And he now studies were
recovering eyesight. Really? Yeah.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,870
What about to damage dies?
Yeah. Really. Yeah. Uh,

3
00:00:06,871 --> 00:00:10,650
so I don't want to freak out because
I know a guy who's got significantly

4
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:15,090
damaged, die from fighting. Well
I can tell you what we've done.

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,940
Um, and this is work we're
writing up for publication now.

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,850
We've done a few things,
three things to the mice.

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,880
One is we've pinched their
optic nerve and crushed it,

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,750
which is a test for
growing neurons in the eye.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,310
And we find that with our reprogramming,
we can make the nerves be just like a,

10
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:34,800
a newborn baby. They grow back. Uh,

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,010
and then we also tested on
glaucoma pressure in the eye.

12
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,170
We increased pressure in the mouse as I,

13
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:44,040
and they lose their largely their
eyesight and we can recover that.

14
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,340
And then we also test old mice that
don't see very well and we also seem to

15
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,880
improve their eyesight almost
back to normal. So what,

16
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:53,310
I don't think we'll be going
to nursing homes anytime soon,

17
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:56,820
but what we are doing is running
clinical trial on this. Um,

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,840
and so we're looking to do that in early
2020 in the clinical trial will be on

19
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:04,140
people with glaucoma
or various eye issues.

20
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,400
The plan is Glaucoma first.
Um, but it could work for
other, uh, damage written as,

21
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,290
as well even broken spinal cords
where we're thinking of trying. Wow.

22
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,780
And that's just one part of the body.

23
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,390
Imagine what it could
potentially do to the rest of us.

24
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,900
Do you feel incredibly fortunate
to be living in the century? Uh,

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,540
I do every day, but I would love to live
next century cause it's gonna be, yeah,

26
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:30,540
but you're,
what's cool is you're kind of at the,

27
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,320
the tip of the spear pushing this
stuff right now. Like you're,

28
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,680
you're going to be one of the guys who
gets to see this stuff get implemented

29
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,480
from your actual own research where
it didn't exist before. Uh, yeah,

30
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,470
that's pretty damn cool.

31
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,710
Better than like living a hundred
years to now where you just take it for

32
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:50,700
granted. Like a trust fund
kid, you know? Yeah, I have it.

33
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:53,310
Just imagine what she can do
in a hundred years. You can,

34
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:57,930
well maybe you'll be here. Where
on the one on the OT? Yeah,

35
00:01:57,931 --> 00:02:02,730
you might be 150. We'll say.
I think there's a chance
someone will be, well, it's,

36
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,390
it's a good chance you're going to be,
I mean,

37
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,550
you're the one who's going to know well,
so here's my philosophy.

38
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,410
I'm not going to let anyone try technology
until I've tried it first. Really?

39
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,090
I was taking in and then
pause because you're,

40
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,220
you're currently doing
something like that.

41
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,130
I'm not doing the three programming yet.
That's a little dangerous.

42
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:25,380
But the others I've always
wanted to know first.

43
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,230
My eyesight is starting to go because
I'm 51 now. And uh, like when I read,

44
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,890
like if I had to read this book,

45
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,850
I got a Nick Christakis his book
from sitting here reading this book.

46
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,960
If I don't have reading glasses on, I
got to do this. It's a bit of a struggle.

47
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:45,710
You're gonna be able to fix
that. So potentially in the
mice we can, you can, we,

48
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,140
we don't give them books to read, but
their eyesight improves. We can test that.

49
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,550
How do you do it? Uh, there's
a moving screen. No, I don't,
I don't mean how to you,

50
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,000
how do you know, how do you test
or not, not how you test rather.

51
00:02:57,001 --> 00:02:59,560
How do you improve their
eyesight? Uh, we've,

52
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,270
we've put these reprogramming genes into
a virus which is already used to treat

53
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,170
genetic diseases in the eye and we inject
it straight into the master's eyeball.

54
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,670
This sounds like the beginning
of a horror movie. Yeah.

55
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,890
I think it's actually
are an awesome movie.

56
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,050
It's the awesome part that I'm focused on.
Well,

57
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:20,860
if you're going blind one injection
from your doctor and then you take an

58
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:23,170
antibiotic,
turn the genes on for as long as you need

59
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,650
and you get your eyesight back.
That's not horrific at all.

60
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,340
That's a pretty incredible, how far away
do you think you are doing it to humans?

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,380
Well, 2020 will be the first
safety study we hope. Wow.

62
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,820
Yeah. But the, the crazy stuff, the
future is, if this all goes well,

63
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,770
you have an injection in your vein,

64
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,820
let's say when you're 30 and then those
viruses infect your body and they sit

65
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:48,820
there dormant until you need them.
So when might you need them?

66
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,930
You might have a car accident, turn
them on, can turn them on with just a,

67
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,510
an antibiotic in a drip or in a pill,
or you start to lose your eyesight taken,

68
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,550
take an antibiotic. So you put them in
your body almost as an insurance policy,

69
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,660
and then you have the option to turn
them on in the future. Exactly. Wow.

70
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,100
That's what we do in the
mice. Now, with every action,

71
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:17,370
we assume there's some negative
consequence or potentially
negative consequence.

72
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:24,190
Right? Uh, we always assume
that, but it's not always right.

73
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,760
So with the molecules that we've
been testing for years now,

74
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:31,660
I can imagine we haven't seen
any downside, just longer
endurance and protection.

75
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,300
So there isn't always a downside
to these things. In fact,

76
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,290
if you just think NMN is replacing a
molecule that we lose over time as we get

77
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:41,920
older, it's just becoming, you
know, it's fairly natural process.

78
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,170
No downside exercising and dieting either.
