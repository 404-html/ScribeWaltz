1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,410
I was,
the World Cup was on today.

2
00:00:01,411 --> 00:00:04,380
I went to get a cup of coffee and they're
the World Cup on and these all these

3
00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:05,970
guys are gathering and
watch the World Cup.

4
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:09,110
To me it's just some dudes running around.
I don't know what's going on. I don't,

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,980
I don't. It's fine. It's great, it's good.

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,980
But for them it was
clearly and for the world,

7
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:17,040
for all the people watching in the stands
as an elevated level of passion for

8
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:18,360
that. Now, if that was your thing,

9
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:21,930
I would say maybe you can be a commentator
or maybe you can be a player or maybe

10
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:24,990
it could be someone who produces one
of those soccer shows or something like

11
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:27,000
that.
There's just plenty of gigs for that.

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,650
But if that's your thing and
instead you get into shoe sales,

13
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:35,940
like Al Bundy, you know, after a while
that shit chips away and you're like,

14
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:40,230
this is not what I like. I like is I want
to play soccer. I want to watch soccer,

15
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,570
I want to talk about soccer,
I want to commentate on soccer.

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,220
You got to find the thing and that ula go.
Not everybody can,

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,340
a on soccer dad is true but is also
a loser mentality like someone can,

18
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,390
yeah. Not everybody can, but how many
people try? That's the other thing.

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,780
Like people say, not everybody can
be successful comedian. You're right.

20
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,460
How many people try though? Right? It's
just not that many people try. You know,

21
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,850
more people could do it then,
then try.

22
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,810
I think there's a bunch of people out
there that could, I always tell you about,

23
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,690
I've told you about this guy. My friend
Dave Dolan, who was a, uh, my boss,

24
00:01:15,691 --> 00:01:20,280
he's a private investigator. When I was
a kid, I got a gig driving him around.

25
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:24,130
He needed an assistant. Really? He got
a Dui and they took his license away.

26
00:01:24,131 --> 00:01:27,780
He needed a driver.
He was the funniest guy I've ever met.

27
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,980
He's right up there with Joey Diaz.
Wow. So funny man. And you know,

28
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,140
not no aspirations for comedy at all.

29
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:39,141
And his cousin was Billy Downs who
was one of the owners of the comedy

30
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:41,130
connection in Boston.
So his,

31
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,340
his cousin was a former comedian who
owned the comedy club and just randomly

32
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,280
became friends with them
from an ad on like, you know,

33
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:53,970
like one of those newspaper ads for
the job seeking a private investigators

34
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:57,270
assistant and wait, that sounds
like a cool job. Oh Wow. Yeah. So,

35
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:02,010
but this guy easily could have been a
comic, like 100% could have been a car.

36
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,120
He's a,

37
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,960
he was a funny fucking dude and he was
always the guy that if a bunch of people

38
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:07,710
were saying around,

39
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,490
he would say something like
totally ridiculous looking
in the eye and say it and

40
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:13,860
everybody would be laughing.
It was just natural.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,770
He was just a naturally funny
guy. Just, just didn't do it.

42
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,420
Did he like being a private investigator?
Loved it. Loved it. Loved busting people.

43
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,780
Cheaters. Mostly people who were cheating
on your insurance. That was mostly,

44
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,440
it was, there was a few of them. One,

45
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:34,850
he got one guy who kept asking him to
take pictures of his girlfriend getting

46
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:39,000
fucked by this giant body builder dude.
And after awhile I was like, hey dude,

47
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,890
enough with this kinky shit.

48
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,600
I'm not giving you any more
fucking pictures through
that. The dude, he's like,

49
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:49,140
get the fuck Outta here with this. He
goes like, what else do you want bro?

50
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,190
I got the pictures that are going to
get more pictures. You fucking idiot.

51
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,270
That's so funny.

52
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,320
That's so funny that why didn't the
guy just hire a photographer? Right.

53
00:02:58,321 --> 00:03:03,190
Well the guy, he was this like
really wealthy but diminutive,

54
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:08,220
very non masculine man and he had this
bombshell girl that he had figured out a

55
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:14,020
way to get a part of and but she was
just getting drilled on the side.

56
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:18,280
Did she know he was getting pictures
taken? I don't think she did. No,

57
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,151
I don't think she put it.

58
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:22,740
It sounds like to me it sounds like
a fetish game where he's like, oh,

59
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,080
seems like a bit of it. I don't think
it was. I think it was just a weak guy.

60
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,090
Didn't know what to do because
they would be on the beach.

61
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:31,780
He get pictures of on the beach making
out and stuff. You're like, he got,

62
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,410
he got enough pictures. A
lot of these guys. I mean, I
don't, yeah, I don't know man.

63
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:37,360
I just,
that to me sounds a little bit like,

64
00:03:37,361 --> 00:03:38,560
well that's what he thought a little bit.

65
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:40,000
He thought the guy was
a little bit of a freak,

66
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,580
but at the end of the day he was
like, look, come on. You know,

67
00:03:42,581 --> 00:03:44,740
it was fucking heavy Boston
accent, Bro. I got you.

68
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:47,560
You fucking pictures did to make a move.
Right.

69
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:52,570
We're not taking any more sale at Saks.
That's a shit job.

70
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,050
I wouldn't want to do that. He'd love
busting people. That's not his thing.

71
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:57,580
He didn't really like,
that was rare.

72
00:03:57,581 --> 00:04:00,610
Most of the time he worked for insurance
companies. Most of the time it was like,

73
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,440
say if you were married and you are a
woman and you had a different maiden name,

74
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:09,430
you would get injured on the job and then
you would start using your maiden name

75
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:12,460
and take a job on the side while
you're getting workman's compensation.

76
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,910
So people would get
double paid. Whoa. Yeah.

77
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,180
And they would have to leave their jobs.

78
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:18,310
Like people would leave their
job super early in the morning.

79
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:21,100
So we would camp out in front of people's
houses where we would get there at

80
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:23,800
four o'clock in the morning
when everybody's asleep.

81
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:27,430
We'd sit in the car across the street
and we'd wait sometimes earlier and we'd

82
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:31,600
wait and we'd wait and we wait five 30
roll around and then you'd see some light

83
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:34,660
go on and they like, he's up, he's up,
he's up here, he goes, here, he goes,

84
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,660
this motherfucker's going to work and
this is the guy who's supposed to be laid

85
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:42,340
up in bed and we catch them like working
as a roofer carrying shingles up a

86
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:46,080
ladder when they're getting disable
a disability insurance. So it's,

87
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,600
that was a really common thing.
Most of it was disability insurance man.

88
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:53,290
What a fucked up state
of life to get into.

89
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:56,470
Or you're doing insurance fraud.
Like that's a,

90
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,030
that's a sad existence to like getting
to that spot where you're like,

91
00:05:01,031 --> 00:05:04,660
I'm going to get, I'm going to give it
to the man. I've come up with a scheme,

92
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:07,300
honey, you know some of
them, the comedy store,

93
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:09,520
I probably can't mention their names.
I'm just not like that man.

94
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,230
See this is the thing, like it was nice
people, they just didn't know better.

95
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,070
And I don't say that like they're stupid.
I say that like they're just dating.

96
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:19,240
I don't think they're going to get caught.

97
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:22,600
They didn't think it was that big a deal.
They didn't think through it very well.

98
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,130
Or if there was one lady was
so nice, she uh, he had a scam.

99
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,370
This was a scam. Safe.
Your license plate number.

100
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,980
He would write down your license plate
number and then write down one that was

101
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:36,010
really close to it and write down another
one that was really close to that.

102
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,030
And then he would knock on your door
and he'd say, I hate to bother you.

103
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,300
But my girlfriend was in a car accident
and the police report where they had the

104
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:48,310
witnesses driver's license number,
a,

105
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:52,630
some coffee got spilled on the report
and they don't know exactly what the

106
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:56,110
license number is. There's, we've
checked these two, it's not them.

107
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,870
I have a friend who works the DMV and
they hooked me up and then you tell her an

108
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:04,040
injury. Oh, I'm sorry. What? What
happened too? Is She okay? She's okay.

109
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,220
But she did this. Oh my
God, I had that same injury.

110
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,960
You tell them the injury that they had
that's giving them Workman's compensation

111
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,350
and uh, yeah, I had the
saint. That's terrible.

112
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,570
Do you guys want to come in
and have a cup of coffee?

113
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,790
She invites us in the fucking house.
Strangers.

114
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,530
This is what people did
in the eighties dude.

115
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,300
They invited people in the house
like pilgrims. Yeah, these crazy,

116
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:31,301
this lady invited two guys into her
house and he spins or a yarn about his

117
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:36,800
girlfriend being injured and she said, I
have the exact same problem. And he said,

118
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:38,010
well, what happened? She said, well,

119
00:06:38,011 --> 00:06:41,540
I was on the job as a flight attendant
and I fell down and hurt myself.

120
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:44,390
And he goes, well, you're getting
paid, aren't ya? And she goes, oh,

121
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:45,380
not all am I getting paid,

122
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:50,000
but I'm also working under my maiden
name and another job. He's like, Oh yeah,

123
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,720
great, great idea. Way To
do it, lady is so nice.

124
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:56,600
And we got out of there and I was like,
man, we can't turn her. And he's like,

125
00:06:56,601 --> 00:07:00,530
fuck car. She goes, wow. She goes,

126
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:04,550
she's a fucking crook. He
goes, that lady's a fucking
crook. Know she's so nice.

127
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:09,460
She let us in her house. She gave
us coffee. That's the car. I love.

128
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,303
That shit man.

129
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:15,820
Via Nice has somehow become synonymous
with not being dangerous or a crook.

130
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,930
That's a really funny thing.
It's like cause being nice is like,

131
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,600
that's like a really
great costume to put on.

132
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:27,860
Like if you want to camouflage yourself.
Yeah, and you're a Predator, right? Yeah.

133
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,390
You know the way light

134
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,010
tiger,
she wasn't a predator.

135
00:07:31,011 --> 00:07:34,790
She was just a lady who didn't think it
was a big deal to rip off a corporation.

136
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,520
People grow up thinking
corporations are faceless,

137
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:41,070
nameless entities and you can
extract money from them. Yeah.

138
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,680
Think that's the way it is.
People think of some liability lawsuits.

139
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:48,530
Like you slip on some water in the hallway
and a big building and you fall down

140
00:07:48,531 --> 00:07:52,610
like, oh, I'm hurt. I'm real
hurt. You guys didn't protect me.

141
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:57,070
My balance was compromised and
I fell on your ground. Somebody,

142
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,930
somebody puts some water on your ground.
I'm not responsible for this.

143
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:01,460
I'm going to sue, sue, sue, sue. Yeah.

144
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:05,730
It's fucked. It's bad that, that, that
woman was making a terrible mistake.

145
00:08:05,731 --> 00:08:10,500
And your, um, your friend Dolan,
dynamite, dickless, Dave Dolan,

146
00:08:10,501 --> 00:08:13,470
he comes over, he helped, he
helped her, he helped her,

147
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,630
he helped her out because
like that kind of shit,

148
00:08:15,631 --> 00:08:19,500
that kind of life like stealing,
you want to create like a,

149
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:24,060
you want to create a version
of that woman were like inside.

150
00:08:24,061 --> 00:08:28,380
She didn't feel alone, at least a little
bad, a little better, a little weak,

151
00:08:28,381 --> 00:08:31,590
a little off balance of course.
But reality,

152
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,470
the reality is she didn't
feel good about that probably.

153
00:08:34,471 --> 00:08:36,960
And that's not a great
way to live, man. And,

154
00:08:36,961 --> 00:08:41,700
and so by getting corrected
by the universe in those ways,

155
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,930
you know, I think it's, it's, it's a
good thing. I'm glad that, you know,

156
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:49,530
some things aren't illegal, for
example, but they are, you know,

157
00:08:49,531 --> 00:08:53,580
like obviously like we agree on some
of these things, right? Those things,

158
00:08:53,581 --> 00:08:58,500
it's fucked up to bus people
that if you're stealing in a, in,

159
00:08:58,501 --> 00:09:03,090
in, uh, in that, in that way. I
don't know, man. No, you're right.

160
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,870
No, you're right. But I would have never
turned her in. I would have said this,

161
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:11,020
I can't die, would've never been a
good private investigator. I just,

162
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:16,080
I feel like a lot of those people
and I was one knee at the time,

163
00:09:16,391 --> 00:09:21,340
21 at the time, at the
most 21 I think. Um,

164
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,520
at that time I was really well aware of
like the re the neighborhood where my

165
00:09:28,781 --> 00:09:31,100
grandparents grew up. Right. Like, and,

166
00:09:31,101 --> 00:09:36,101
and being around them and being around
my parents who grew up in the 60s and

167
00:09:36,491 --> 00:09:38,680
then my grandparents who grew up,
I mean they were,

168
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,170
they were here in the
depression and they just,

169
00:09:41,171 --> 00:09:45,880
there was a different attitude
about opportunity. Like
everybody was poor. Right?

170
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,081
Yeah.

171
00:09:46,081 --> 00:09:49,090
Everybody would like take advantage of
every opportunity and if you've got an

172
00:09:49,091 --> 00:09:52,270
opportunity to run a scam,
yeah, you did it. Yeah.

173
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,090
And that's a terrible
thing that happens in,

174
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,120
in poor communities is that people
do think of like insurance scams,

175
00:10:00,311 --> 00:10:03,490
this kind of scam. Like, you know, you
got to think about it like it's a score,

176
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,880
you know, think about it. Like it's a
score. I've heard guys say that to me.

177
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:10,930
I know older Italian guys, look, you've
got to think about this. This is a score.

178
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,450
Okay, can't fuck this up.
You've got an opportunity here.

179
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,990
All you have to do is you go to the
fucking chiropractor. My backers,

180
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,460
they can't tell you why your back hurts.

181
00:10:18,461 --> 00:10:22,010
Nobody knows why you're fucking that
Kurtz. Which is true. Yeah. You know,

182
00:10:22,011 --> 00:10:25,030
you would go to a chiropractor every day
and say, my back is fucking killing me.

183
00:10:25,031 --> 00:10:27,850
I got a shooting pain down my leg.
They can't prove it or disprove it.

184
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,820
Next thing you know,
you get a $35,000 check in the mail.

185
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,420
Right? Yeah. I, you know, man,
here's the thing. Number one,

186
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,500
I feel like I have to say this,

187
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,980
I would not have turned this fucking
that woman in if I was not a private

188
00:10:38,981 --> 00:10:43,210
investigator, but that'd
be in Dolan. Ethically.

189
00:10:43,211 --> 00:10:44,950
You had to turn her in.
Cause if he didn't,

190
00:10:44,951 --> 00:10:48,130
he would be guilty of stealing from the
person who was giving him money to do

191
00:10:48,131 --> 00:10:52,150
the job. There was never a question right
then. That's what he did for a living.

192
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,190
He was turned around.
Yeah.
