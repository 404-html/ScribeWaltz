1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,850
Yeah. Um, man,

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,930
it's going to be a weird world
when our kids are our age.

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,070
It's going to be a weird,
weird world. I mean,

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,260
I don't even think we could
begin to comprehend it.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,300
I think we'd be totally guessing.

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,510
Think there's some shit that's
coming around the corner.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,890
Do you see that NASA,
Tom Delonge thing?

8
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:28,540
Everybody keeps harassing me
about um, the uh, the video,

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,960
the Ufo. I'm here, I'm reading are
turning up more videos all day long.

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,590
I'll be like not just one
video. Let's see. Let me see.

11
00:00:36,591 --> 00:00:39,500
One of them videos is Tom delonge
putting out videos and know his,

12
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,200
his organization is putting out
videos of you. Fos. Yeah. And it's,

13
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:46,340
I'm a fighter pilot and f a 18,

14
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:51,370
I believe is chasing this thing and
it's showing all the details of like the

15
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:57,140
Lao, the altitude, how fast it's going,
what pitch it's at and all that jazz.

16
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,500
I don't know what that means, what pitches
hot, but they're watching this thing,

17
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,750
they're trying to figure out what it is.
One of the guys is like, it's a drone.

18
00:01:02,751 --> 00:01:05,800
It's gotta be some kind of a drone.
They see something and it turns,

19
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,010
it was going very fast. Basically.
It's like all the other Ufo,

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,310
but it should not worry.
Yeah, it's blurry.

21
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,060
It's in like a gun sites or like,
you know,

22
00:01:17,061 --> 00:01:19,330
some sort of a infrared site rather.
Um,

23
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,120
so you're looking at it through this
weird infrared video where it doesn't

24
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,160
necessarily look, you know,
it's weird. It's weird. You're
looking at it like, okay,

25
00:01:28,161 --> 00:01:30,260
what am I looking at? I'm
looking at it. A little object.

26
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:31,850
Do you remember that quote?

27
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,930
It could be a total bullshit quote
from Warner von Braun. He, uh,

28
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,230
that he said right before he died that,
uh,

29
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:43,280
beware of the fake alien invasion.
Did he say that in so many words?

30
00:01:43,281 --> 00:01:45,920
I hope he did. I hope he did it.
He did it just to fuck with people.

31
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,700
It's amazing flying around. There's a
whole fleet of, I'm looking at my asa

32
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,010
gotcha. Oh, going against the wind.

33
00:01:55,011 --> 00:01:57,210
The wind's a hustle west,

34
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,860
so they're following it for a while
and then it changes direction.

35
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,300
It's rotating.

36
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,730
So whatever that is,
whatever that is.

37
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,330
Is Vr fucking super interesting. And, uh,

38
00:02:23,331 --> 00:02:27,980
I heard the now going to shoo fly Travis
Barker to Washington DC to talk to

39
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,990
people and give him some
information as well. No neck.

40
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,870
They're gonna fly Kanye West.
He,

41
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,700
they're going to fly him out and show
him the secret lab for real. No. Oh,

42
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,110
I'm making this up because I think
it's crazy flying Tom delonge I know.

43
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:44,910
I might not be fake. It might
be real. It could be it. Look,

44
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:49,280
here's the thing about aliens, right? How
often do you think they'd have to visit?

45
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,660
I think they could get it done once
in the 70s and be done with us.

46
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,380
They check us out and they'd be
a look at these crazy ass holes.

47
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,900
This is what we're going
to do. We're going to, uh,

48
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,770
we're going to install some cameras
on the moon. These stupid fuckers,

49
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:03,850
they won't even be able to see it.

50
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,690
We'll just put some big ass cameras to
film them from the distance and let's get

51
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:09,970
out of here.
These people are crazy like this.

52
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,510
They're going to have nuclear power
with these assholes and they just would

53
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:17,140
never see them again.
So like if that really is a Ufo,

54
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,940
if it really is from
another planet rather,

55
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,470
how many times they have to come here,
you don't, I mean if they are real,

56
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,630
how much evidence would
you really see of him?

57
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,970
Would you see it once every 10 years?
How are, how often would they come about?

58
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,001
Was it you?

59
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:34,760
Maybe someone had a joke that like maybe
this is like the [inaudible] of the

60
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:36,230
university and this is the deal.

61
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,340
A lot of outer space really come down
here when they're fucked up and they want

62
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:43,450
to see a show. Was that party? Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. That was a whole, yeah,

63
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:47,650
that's super old. It's 2000 early.
Two thousands yeah. I think it's,

64
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,030
I'm not a nonbeliever that's for fuck.
Shoer I think it's entirely possible.

65
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:55,570
Like if, if I looked up in the
sky and an alien ship flew by,

66
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,890
I would never think there's no way that
can't be real. It can't be possible.

67
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,650
I would think. Wow, they
fucking, they visited us.

68
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,890
I mean I'm sure there's something out
there that's smart. I'm sure there is.

69
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,130
It's a matter of what it would look like.
You know what?

70
00:04:09,131 --> 00:04:12,640
It even be in a physical form
anymore. I mean, why do we assume,

71
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,210
we assume that everything has to be in a
physical form? What are you looking at?

72
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,140
Kendrick Lamar says he saw a Ufo,
but nobody believes them.
