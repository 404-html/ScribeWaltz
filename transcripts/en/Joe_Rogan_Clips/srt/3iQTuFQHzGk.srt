1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,430
The joe rogan experience. Yeah, most
try to come up with the name of it.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,080
They're all the same, but all access
embedded 24 seven a bed. It's very good.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,570
I should, I should remember
the name. It's very good.

4
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:13,560
They're all the other on this.

5
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:18,561
This new one is really good cause it's
got Max Holloway running on a treadmill,

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,860
two treadmills over from Norma Madoff
who's also running on a treadmill and

7
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:25,080
they're fucking very cool to each other.
It's very interesting.

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,260
It could be thanked him for taking the
time, which she should. She should.

9
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:31,680
Thanks for taking the fight. And then
they have the same a weight coach like,

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,870
yeah, that's crazy. Lockhart, right?
It's Leah [inaudible] card is d.

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,720
This is Lockhart working with number
of men on this as well. Both of them.

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,290
So Lockhart was like,
Lockhart is legit.

13
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,860
Like he goes over calculations
of like how much you weigh,

14
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:49,560
how much water you're going to take,
and he's weighing things out.

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,550
It took them an hour and a half to do the
calculations. Yeah. It wasn't like, hey,

16
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,250
we're going to wing this. It's like,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

17
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:00,900
We're going to do this
weight cut correctly. And
he's got it down to the day,

18
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,690
you know, like it's six days to lose. He
think he was one 71 is that, is that the,

19
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,710
I was wondering what he, what
did he start at? Does it when?

20
00:01:07,711 --> 00:01:10,320
71 so I think he's got to lose 16 pounds.

21
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,030
What's crazy is when Max was on my show,

22
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:17,760
I was talking to him a little bit off it,
and this is on record, on that spilled.

23
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:21,570
Anything that he didn't say, but he just
goes, you know, I've, with the injury,

24
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:26,700
Jesus credit embedded, I think it's
better than that. UFC, not UFC,

25
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:30,240
the HBO ones.
I think it's been 24 seven how dare you,

26
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,450
I think it's better than only four seven
when there's a big fight generals or

27
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,950
blah, I think, well, I think in general
they're better because they do more of it.

28
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,050
But a 24 seven they're good.
They're fucking good. Very
good. Liev Schreiber. Oh,

29
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,710
I'd love that Bro. Watch her
work. But I like these better.

30
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,450
I only cat Liev Schreiber. Yeah.
Was like till night air wing girl,

31
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,570
but it was nowhere does it say? Yeah,
it was horrible this because there's,

32
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,760
there's almost no narration, right?
Yeah. It's almost just, it tells a story.

33
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:00,811
I want to see the footage.

34
00:02:00,811 --> 00:02:03,570
How would it like the video of when
they called Max with the fight?

35
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,840
Cause from what I heard, he goes, it
could be that stuff's getting the world.

36
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:11,790
Fuck yeah, let's go. What? Just saying
why don't they have a video of that?

37
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,450
But no one knew. I don't think they
knew, you know, to to turn the video on.

38
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,530
I don't think Max knew
what they were calling him.

39
00:02:17,531 --> 00:02:21,540
Amazing video of him being like,
it's actually few wins.

40
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,830
This is my thing with Max is I think
Khabib is the toughest fight in the world

41
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:29,520
on six days notice I'd rather fight
anybody else in the world and could be one

42
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:34,260
six days because of this style injures
his tenacity. But with Max win,

43
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:36,510
lose or draw,
whatever happens Saturday night,

44
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,130
if you don't respect and like him
even more after this, you're a moron.

45
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,280
You're a champions on a run,

46
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:47,880
like Max Holloway's on that would be
willing to take this fight on six days

47
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:52,320
notice. And also I should say coming
off of a broken foot. Correct.

48
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,380
So he had to pull out of a fight with
a broken foot with Frankie Edgar.

49
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:56,370
What's just happened?

50
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,400
So I mean how he'll dizzy
and like it said on my show,

51
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:02,810
he was saying you're not,
I've been doing some Jujitsu,

52
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,900
been the swing of things for me it's
good because I haven't been balls deep in

53
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,360
training. I've just been a little Jujitsu,
you know, getting a light workout.

54
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,330
But it gives me time with my
family and he gives, which he goes,

55
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:17,200
you know this in camp, you're present but
you're not, which is true. And he goes,

56
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:20,650
you know, so I'm going through it.
I'm, I'm with my son in the family,

57
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,060
but I'm thinking about something else.

58
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:26,050
So this has been good for me to really
focus on my family. That was what,

59
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:29,490
two weeks ago? Three weeks ago.
Wow. So then pay him, you're fine.

60
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,320
Could be even the reason why he wants
to fight Khabib is cause he thinks could

61
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:34,240
be the best pound for
pound fighter in the world.

62
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,880
And which is nuts because you know,
when you look at it could be Dresner.

63
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,750
It's good. It's, it's, it's,
it doesn't blow your hair back.

64
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,920
He's 25 and Oh for God sakes it's good.
But it's not like all this crazy,

65
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:49,450
you know, big names on his regular.
But you talked, I was just in San Jose.

66
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:53,230
John Fitch goes, dude, uh, and this is
John Fitch. Yeah. You know, it could be,

67
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:57,790
you know, welterweight goat. He's fucking
not cope. He's got damn good. He goes,

68
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,780
I've never seen anyone my
lifetime like could be. He goes,

69
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:05,140
I fought GSP in his prime. He would
beat him. That's how good he is.

70
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,730
DC said he's the pound for pound.

71
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:10,390
Greatest fighters ever seen DC
said that he had fights with them.

72
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:15,250
Like dcs was the heavyweight Strikeforce
champion. He said, he goes, dude,

73
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:20,240
we go to war. We go to war war.
Like imagine that DC's a Gar,

74
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,950
Willa, he's jacked. I mean,
DC's got some body fat on him.

75
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,720
He's strong as a fucking ox.
You see soak at downtown.

76
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:32,680
So fun to watch. When DC throws
Josh Barnett through the air,

77
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:34,270
when they fought Strikeforce,
he just go,

78
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,070
Jesus handled fight was offensive.

79
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,320
That goddamn American,
it was offensive.

80
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,620
He ragdolled Hendo and couldn't be a
cooler guy like the nicest guy ever.

81
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:49,150
DC might be the nicest
fighter of all time.

82
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,070
One of my favorite people here and Max,
they're up there.

83
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,920
I love him for Isis fighters.
I don't know Max as well as I would know.

84
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:55,720
Do you see,
because I've done so many shows with them,

85
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:01,050
but for DC as good as he is to
say that him and Khabib go to war.

86
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:05,710
I'm like, that's crazy to Josh
Thompson is the cap ne Kay said,

87
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,400
you know Ed Ruth, the Penn state
three time national champion freak,

88
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:12,930
just start doing MMA and Beltre
complete freak wrestling. He,

89
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,030
I was in San Jose and he, yeah,
I did a show with him and I go,

90
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:18,070
what were you doing? He goes,
I just came from practice.

91
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:21,010
Could be second class practice and
go, what was he doing? He goes, oh,

92
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,920
just straight wrestling. I said, uh, who
was the restaurant? He was Ed Ruth. I,

93
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,120
oh my God, the Penn state like legend.
He goes, yeah man, how's that go down?

94
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,720
And he's like, and only one of them's
gone down and it could be like,

95
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,970
what Ruth? And he goes,
oh, he goes, bro it,

96
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:40,020
I've never seen anything like it.
So there's just this legend of five.

97
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,680
They skipped. When they tell me
that, it scares me like, well,

98
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,050
who do we get to see it in action?
When you saw the Barboza fight,

99
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,730
he's walking towards him like a Zombie
gets a hold of them. And just rag dolls.

100
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:52,780
I'm just rag dolls.

101
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,690
But this is what's great about this
fight and this what makes our sport so

102
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,010
specialist. Yeah, super bombed.

103
00:05:58,011 --> 00:06:00,590
I've been in deep depression
because Ferguson fell out,

104
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,420
and we've talked about this off here,

105
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,980
but our sports so special because
what Max Holloway has the chance to do

106
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:10,550
Saturday night, if he can beat him,
if he can somehow pull that out.

107
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,550
There's nothing like in professional
sports, there's nothing like it.

108
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,780
If Lebron goes out, the team still goes
on. It's whatever. If Tom Brady gets hurt,

109
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:21,530
it sucked. But they still
play here. You know, man,

110
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:25,550
Max has a huge chance now are the
odds stacked against him? Good God.

111
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,590
Are they ever,
there couldn't be a worst matchup for him,

112
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:31,310
but what's the one Achilles heel,
if there is one for,

113
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:34,160
could beam a guy who can
strike going backwards.

114
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,850
Max Salaries Pretty fucking good
at going backwards. Yeah, it's,

115
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:42,230
it's a fascinating fight.
If there was no controversy,

116
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:46,750
if it wasn't like six day time
period for him, that's great. I know.

117
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,590
It's kind of cool. Do you want,
have the fight that's been like,

118
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:51,200
that was a Nate when Nate
took on Connor and the first,

119
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:55,220
here's the difference though. Nate's the
bigger guy, right? Nate's the bigger guy,

120
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:59,330
the more seasoned guy there. So for Nate,
it's like, yeah, it was short notice,

121
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:02,090
but that's a rough
matchup for Connor Connor.

122
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:03,440
It should be an underdog in that fight.

123
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:04,790
They wouldn't find it
the same weight class.

124
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:08,240
So that makes it a little more sense.
But wait a minute. They do Nate.

125
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,470
Nate fights at 55, uh, before that though,
he's fine at 70. Right? Oh, no, no, no.

126
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:15,080
He only fought three times at seven,
but he saw that 70 is the point.

127
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:19,250
He fired a never fought at 70. Right.
But if con when Carter fought him at 70,

128
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,490
that was Saturday. Yeah. College. Never
funny. You're not 70 pounder. Right.

129
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:26,660
But I mean, Nate, when he fought 70, it
didn't go well. I mean, who did he fight?

130
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:30,980
He fought Rory Macdonald. 70.
Tough. Who else did he fight?

131
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,810
We don't see if I had 70,
uh, lost his fights at 70, I
think wasn't great at it. No,

132
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:38,990
he didn't lose all of them. Wasn't great
one. Yeah, it wasn't great at 70. How,

133
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:42,680
but the thing is, he's the
bigger man. He's a bigger guy.

134
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:47,670
But if they agreed to fight at one 55, he
would make the one 55 weight. 100% yes.

135
00:07:47,671 --> 00:07:51,140
It's like there was all this talk about
him being so much bigger than Conor. Oh,

136
00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:55,330
he's bigger for sure. Taller. He's
taller. He's amazing. He's a bigger guy.

137
00:07:55,331 --> 00:07:57,230
It's around heavier when he gets heavier,

138
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,750
but when they fight it
55 he makes that weight.

139
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,910
And Connor makes that weight tough too.

140
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:07,090
They both struggled to make one 55 it's
a much easier cup for counter at 55 it's

141
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:09,080
not the hardest cut.

142
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,840
But when you look at the difference
between how he looks physically when he

143
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:16,580
fought Nate at one 70 and how he looks
when he's, you know, one 45 he was awful.

144
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,300
I was going to say he's on, Donna can
make one 45 naked Nav. I mean there's,

145
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,930
there's no problem.

146
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,470
He could have made it intimate
fighter when it was cut a leg off.

147
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,790
You don't have to like real list.

148
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:29,000
He's not making 40 he was very thin
during the ultimate fighter days.

149
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,730
Remember we have to be, cause
you're on marine and fighter, right?

150
00:08:31,731 --> 00:08:34,100
So you have to make weight
basically three times in a row.

151
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,070
Well I just think he filled in too.
I mean he was really young back then.

152
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,530
100% but you have to
maintain a lower weight.

153
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,750
That's the closest fight to it
though. I agree with that fight. No,

154
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,860
I agree with you. The same kind of
balls that Nate has is like what?

155
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:51,740
What it but max that differences
that like Max has taken on a guy that

156
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,660
everybody's avoiding. No one's
been able to, the riddle of Khabib.

157
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,540
No one's even ever even put
them in jeopardy like he's,

158
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:03,010
he's like a Johnson hit them,
but black rarely wasn't in a while.

159
00:09:03,011 --> 00:09:04,830
It was going a bit,
we were talking about that the other day.

160
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:07,560
Who knows what was going on in that fight
because that was a fight where he had

161
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:10,770
the same issue cutting weight that
he did when he had to pull out of the

162
00:09:10,771 --> 00:09:13,950
Ferguson fight where body
shutdown. Correct. So who knows?

163
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,480
He had that same issue with the Michael j.

164
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:17,280
He might've been severely
compromised in that fight,

165
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:18,840
even though he beat the
fuck out of a great,

166
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,520
the difference between Mcgregor and Diaz
is the both keeping on the feet really,

167
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,640
right? Yeah. He has a phenomenal
boxer comes phenomenal striker,

168
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,290
Max Holloway phenomena. Striker could
be phenomenal grappler. So it's a,

169
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,210
it's even more of a task because could be,

170
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,090
he's not going to sit there
and strike with him. That's
your one way to win. Cool.

171
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:39,510
I'm the best grappler on earth. Yeah.
He'll entertain it for a little bit,

172
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,620
but if you, if you want you down, there's
literally no one in the world from,

173
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:48,540
I'll say one 55 to one seven he's not
going to take that. I want to see,

174
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,950
I really want to see him in some
straight grappling competition to,

175
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,580
you're hearing this, hearing that about
how amazing is in the training room.

176
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,580
I'll tell you it from a guy like DC.
I know and and, and Fitch and hops.

177
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,570
You're talking about in the hall,
pioneers of the sport animals.

178
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,710
I want to see him against Woodley at 70
I think 70 is his natural weight class.

179
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,770
Yeah. I think he'd probably be
a lot healthier. Imagine that.

180
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,750
Imagine being stronger and healthcare.
It Woodley and Khabib. Jesus. What?

181
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,700
But Woodley's a different
thing, man. You, you miss you,

182
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:21,090
you fuck up and you leave yourself in
a position to get hit with one of those

183
00:10:21,091 --> 00:10:22,130
nuclear bombs.
Oh,

184
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,460
knock out Woodley could put
people to sleep and he can
grab his ass, his ass off.

185
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,550
Hard to take down and puts
people to sleep with one shot.

186
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,110
I don't think he gets his due.

187
00:10:31,111 --> 00:10:35,940
And I think the best evidence is the two
fights that people point to where they

188
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,480
say that like Woodley should've done
better. Those are the Thompson fights,

189
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,910
the end of the my fight. But
Maya, it never got hurt like he,

190
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,550
he hit my a bunch of times,
but it was uneventful cause he was hurt.

191
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,100
Woodley was her early in the
first round with the shoulder.

192
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:53,140
He fucked his shoulder up,
by the way. Should fight my,

193
00:10:53,141 --> 00:10:56,670
if you don't want to go to the ground
100% but my point is in those two fights

194
00:10:56,671 --> 00:10:59,490
with Thompson Woodley was
the one who hurt Thompson.

195
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:04,170
He hurt him that bad in both fights.
Almost stopped him in both fights. Yeah.

196
00:11:04,171 --> 00:11:06,730
I don't see them ever fight again,
but I hear you. Great Fun. Yeah.

197
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:12,200
I'll pass hard pass where there was
a crazy UFC 200 cards that was on it.

198
00:11:12,201 --> 00:11:17,160
I wouldn't be mad. He was one of
the, as a main event, I get it.

199
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,970
I get it. I like twice.
Wow. Cool. Yeah. No,

200
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:25,860
that's a super complicated upset, upset
though. They're just not good day.

201
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:28,530
It's one and the same thing.
If they just said no,

202
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:30,410
this time it's gonna be different.
I'm going to war,

203
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,600
go to war and then two rounds and you
like bastard is circling each other.

204
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:39,630
That's like Dana on a Ferguson and Khabib.
He's like,

205
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:44,250
that fights never happened to a fifth
time not happening. I'm like, I get it.

206
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,970
I get it man. It's such a bummer
though. Let's talk business like,

207
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,490
I don't know how many paper
views this was going to do,

208
00:11:50,491 --> 00:11:53,320
but for the hardcore fans,
this was a big one.

209
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,420
This was a big one because this is
the first time could be biz fighting.

210
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,170
A guy that's super versatile,
they can fight standing up,

211
00:11:59,171 --> 00:12:00,460
can knock you out with one shot.

212
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:04,750
Tough is Falk has incredible endurance
and can grab off his back and the most

213
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:06,700
dangerous guy it could be will ever face.
Yeah.

214
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:11,530
Tony Ferguson has the perfect
style to test what was,

215
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,710
so we could really find out where could
bebes act cause we know we're Tony's at

216
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,820
we and we kind of know
where it could bebes at.

217
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,020
Okay.
