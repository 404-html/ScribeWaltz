1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,680
When you're sleeping at night,
we camped.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,280
We would do snow shoe like just deep into
the back. So we had, we would go into,

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,090
you had to do your cold weather training.

4
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:12,030
So getting your dry suits on and
swimming through the surf at nighttime.

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,280
Wonderful. Which is an ice cream
headache over and over and over again.

6
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:20,000
And as the ocean breaks over your head,
it's pretty bad. And the cold weather, uh,

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,620
immersion test is there where you have
to get into the water but just a pair of

8
00:00:22,621 --> 00:00:25,710
shorts on for five minutes
and just then reward yourself.

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,750
So they get you to a point of hypothermia,
right to the edge. It's um, I think, uh,

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,300
as many things are in my old job,

11
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:38,301
there is a aspect of learning and there
is an aspect of tough it out and you

12
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:41,100
combine the two. So it,
it sucked. And there was,

13
00:00:41,101 --> 00:00:43,260
there was a reason that
they wanted it to suck,

14
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:45,060
but they're also trying to teach a lesson.
Right?

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,650
But God forbid they just teach the lesson.

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,920
So they make you suffer to
ingrain it probably. Yeah.

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,900
So one day you wake up and on the board,

18
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,450
like a little white board that
has the list of gear you need.

19
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:59,250
It just says shorts running shoes. I'm
like, okay, this is February and Kodiak,

20
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:02,820
what are you talking about? They like
I said, I said, shorts, running shoes,

21
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,220
get out in the forward,
ICAN align van.

22
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,250
So we all get out there and they drive
to the beach where seawater is freezing

23
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:13,440
at the edge and they say, okay, go out.

24
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:16,350
You have to completely submerge
yourself neck deep water, five minutes.

25
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:17,190
And the timer starts,

26
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,220
timer starts when the last person
submerges their head. Oh God.

27
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,120
So you might be first, you might
be able to be all fired up and it,

28
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,260
you're just going to get seven and a
half minutes is what you're getting.

29
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,420
So you go and you sit
there and it's the coal,

30
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,010
it hurts for a minute
and then you're numb.

31
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,840
The worst thing about it
actually is rewarming.

32
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,950
It feels like you're just getting pin
pricked over and over and over again. Yes.

33
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,280
That's actually a Barklow.
Oh,

34
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:45,510
that is Barklow look at him standing up
there on that rock will Barklow has a

35
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:49,620
great rewarming drill that we actually
played on the podcast before for Sitka

36
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,250
where he uh,
takes their gear and jumps into a lake.

37
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,410
So that is the rather yeah.

38
00:01:55,411 --> 00:02:00,411
And then re warms himself with basically
all sit cause gear and figures out how

39
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:04,500
to get your body back to what I thought
it was interesting that I'd never really

40
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:05,040
considered those.

41
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,970
That eating food actually ramps up your
body heat because you have to burn off

42
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:11,370
the calories,
your body starts processing.

43
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:14,430
The food actually is good for elevating
potty temperature, eating food,

44
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,750
especially if you can get hot food of
course. But just eating. So the drill,

45
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,820
the drill he was doing
actually had much more, uh,

46
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,390
I would say educational benefit
because they would make them,

47
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,280
they would take them there
with all of their gear,

48
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:29,820
their gearless would say whatever they
were wearing, plus bring your tent,

49
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:32,490
your sleeping bag and all your stuff
because we're going to put you into the

50
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:35,520
water and then you need to survive
your way out of it. So they would,

51
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,290
they would have to erect a tent.

52
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,500
They would have to get their sleeping
bag out all after being in the water for

53
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:40,951
five minutes,

54
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:44,220
which is exactly what a survival
situation is going to look like for us.

55
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,260
We went in there,
got back into the van,

56
00:02:46,261 --> 00:02:48,300
and I sat in a hot tub and drank
beer for the rest of the day.

57
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,740
So I got the understanding of what it
feels like to be hypothermic and that just

58
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,050
see they have to push
their head underwater. Woo.

59
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,170
That guy right there is either screwing
everybody or was the first person to

60
00:02:58,171 --> 00:02:59,600
complete it.
Um,

61
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,650
now Wim Hoff does so much of this
cold water submersion stuff and he,

62
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,210
he actually enjoys it and loves it.
You know?

63
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:10,810
Do you think that there's a way that
you could use like his methods and get

64
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:14,860
through that with less pain potentially,
even though you know,

65
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,040
all of the skills that I used in Kodiak,
I,

66
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,540
I did not ever use a single one of them.
Operationally,

67
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,860
I use his breathing method in the
Cryo tank. That makes sense. Therapy,

68
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,340
that makes sense. But that art does
Arctic conditions, I don't know,

69
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:32,980
at least in the modern theaters
of war were engaged in,

70
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:34,720
I don't know where the
applicability would be.

71
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,610
So it might be a little bit of a benefit
versus time expended to teach the guys

72
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:42,510
that stuff. You know,
because unless it's a,

73
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,200
we're talking like Korea probably
farther in the northern latitudes.

74
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:50,920
I mean it's, uh, like the
training was amazing. Like I said,

75
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:54,670
I didn't use a single bit of it.
Right. But if something, well,

76
00:03:54,671 --> 00:03:57,730
it's also building mental
toughness and determination.

77
00:03:57,731 --> 00:04:00,610
And that's why I said there's an aspect
of learning and there's an aspect of

78
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:03,100
just, this is going to suck.
Hey you guys, guess what?

79
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:06,850
You're going to do a 20 kilometer hike
into the back country and snow shoes.

80
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,710
There is no end state to this. There's no
target. You're going to do anything on.

81
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,010
You're just going to go out there and
you're going to do it and you're going to

82
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,540
survive out there and it's going to suck
for three days and then you're gonna

83
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,180
come back.
You just embrace this suck.

84
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,640
Or you learn how to pack your
backpack better, you know,

85
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:24,310
or you learn how to move better over that
terrain are you learn how to navigate

86
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:26,080
in that environment.
So there's always an essence of it,

87
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:29,230
but it just happens to be that there's
usually a pain component with it as well.

88
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,990
Yeah.
A lot of military training is like that.

89
00:04:31,991 --> 00:04:36,730
There's an essence of a pain compliance
and then the actual learning technique

90
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:41,460
as well. Yeah, it's the learning
technique. I mean, it is really,

91
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:46,560
you're, you're learning a technique to
manage your mind under sucky conditions.

92
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,360
I mean, that is a
technique as well, right?

93
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,750
So I was actually having a conversation
with somebody about this recently. Uh,

94
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:58,250
I'm of the opinion that really the only
thing that I learned how to do when I

95
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:02,640
was a seal was to enhance my
ability to learn other things.

96
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,050
It's, you're selecting for people
and, and to get to that point,

97
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,090
you've got to maintain
control of your emotions,

98
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:11,220
whether you're in pain or you're
hot or you're cold. So there's that,

99
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,870
that essence of self control,

100
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:17,130
but then they require so many different
skill sets in so many different things

101
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,760
that the selection process is looking
for and then at the end of it,

102
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:24,900
teaching people how to become
better learners and then
you just refine that over

103
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:27,450
and over and over again over a career.

104
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:32,940
It's the ability to learn is probably
the biggest takeaway that I have from my

105
00:05:32,941 --> 00:05:33,774
time in service.

106
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,860
I think that's the best thing you could
ever really learn is learning how to

107
00:05:37,861 --> 00:05:40,800
learn. Like learning how to learn
correctly. Learning how to actual,

108
00:05:40,801 --> 00:05:44,550
pay attention to what someone's teaching
you and absorb it and follow the steps

109
00:05:44,551 --> 00:05:48,960
rather than fuck it up with your own ego
and your own insecurities or whatever

110
00:05:48,961 --> 00:05:52,260
it is. It's going to trip you up.
If you can get good at something,

111
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,820
you know you can, you can apply that
to almost anything if you really,

112
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,370
yeah, and, and then they would pair
it with, we'll surround you by, okay,

113
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:02,450
we want to make you better at shooting.

114
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:05,360
So we are going to go find world champion,
pistol carving shooters.

115
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:10,100
Go apply your ability to learn with
them and we to do it for weeks.

116
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,170
Okay? Now you're going to specialize.
You're going to be appointment,

117
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,840
so you need to be able
to navigate and climb.

118
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,960
So we're going to send you out to Joshua
tree for two weeks with worldclass

119
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,240
climbers.
Go apply your ability to learn with them,

120
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,120
and then jumping and then diving,
and then tactics,

121
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:25,700
and then fill in the blank over a career.
