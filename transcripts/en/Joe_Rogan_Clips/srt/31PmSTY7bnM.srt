1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,980
So I think this is it.
There's a bigger discussion.

2
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:05,070
I think both of you could probably shed
some important light on too outside of

3
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:05,904
Twitter.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,210
This weaponization of content
from platforms is being
used to get people banned

5
00:00:09,211 --> 00:00:11,830
from their banking accounts. You
know, they're getting there. Uh,

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,570
we can talk about Patrion for
instance, and again, I'm not, this is,

7
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,270
this may just be something you
could chime in on. Patrion band,

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,520
a man named Carl Benjamin and
also known as Sargon of a cod.

9
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:21,630
He's also banned from Twitter.

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,850
And it was because you know why he
got banned from Twitter. Um, I can see

11
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:30,950
that's an interesting one.

12
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,660
Uh, I do have some, some
of the details here. Um,

13
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,730
do you want me to read them? Okay. Um,
it looks like it's going to be growth.

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,610
It's not stuff that I love saying.
Um,

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,200
but I will say it should make,

16
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:53,460
he doesn't like cursing either. Um,
let's see. I curse more than he does,

17
00:00:53,461 --> 00:00:58,200
so I guess I should say it a first strike.
Um, fuck white people kill all men die.

18
00:00:58,201 --> 00:01:02,740
CISCOM none of the above qualify
as hate speech. Was that,

19
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,320
uh, I don't have the dates, I'm
sorry. But he's, he's a white guy.

20
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,400
I mean obviously he's joking around there.
Fuck white people.

21
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,800
It also sounds like he's trying to make
a point about your roles and how you

22
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:18,230
enforce them. Not actually also exactly
why you got kicked off patriarch. He was,

23
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,770
it was exactly.
Well,

24
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:23,490
I know he also posted a
photo of interracial gay porn
at some white nationalists

25
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:28,270
to make them angry. Yes.
Yeah. He's funny. He's funny.

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,153
I'm dying.

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,930
I can understand how a posting that photo
is that an egregious violation of the

28
00:01:33,931 --> 00:01:36,660
rules, whether, whether or not he
was trying to insult some people.

29
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,580
That's a very good point.
And I wanted to bring that up.

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,380
Is Porn a violation of the rules?

31
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:42,933
Uh,

32
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,690
porn generally? No. Good.
Really good for you.

33
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,870
Why would he bends in
my feed all the time?

34
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:53,100
I follow a couple of naughty girls
and occasionally they post pictures of

35
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:56,970
themselves engaging in intercourse. I'm
like, yikes. So then what, what else,

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,750
what are the other strikes for
Saigon or car? Let's see. Um,

37
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,280
there was the use of a Jewish
slur. Um, how do you use it?

38
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,290
A to a person.

39
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:12,120
You trader remainer white
genocide supporting Islamic file.

40
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,910
Did you slur lover

41
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,610
that should keep you going
Hashtag Hitler was right.

42
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,710
But these are general opinions. These are
targeted. They're targeted at somebody.

43
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,740
That sounds like he's being sick.
Like he's making a joke.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,460
You're going to say understanding context.
It sounds like the other one,

45
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,850
like in context what he's
saying, particularly the
fact that he's a white guy,

46
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,280
that doesn't sound like
a racial slur at all.

47
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,880
I mean he's saying fuck white people
and he is white and context. Again,

48
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:44,290
these are tied together. I always knew
that person was not to be trusted.

49
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,780
That fucking Jewish slur.

50
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:51,890
Oh you saying there's a bunch of very
specific person trying to be very precise.

51
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,430
A specific Jewish person. I don't know
the race of this person. I'm sorry.

52
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,460
And this is not okay, but this
is it. This is not parody.

53
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:03,760
This is not joking around. We didn't
view it that way. I'm just telling,

54
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:07,300
I'm not trying to like re litigate all
this. I'm just telling you what they were.

55
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,020
I knew he had done things that were
like egregious violations of the rules

56
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:13,810
because you know, plain and simple,
I didn't bring him up to, you know,

57
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,070
go through and try and figure out a feat,

58
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,640
but that it does sound like at least the
first one was meant to be a critique of,

59
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,490
yeah. So there are a bunch of others.
If you want to hear him more than that,

60
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,970
keep it rolling. Again, targeted,

61
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,670
this is how I know one day that I'll
be throwing you from a helicopter.

62
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:31,300
You're the same kind of malignant cancer.
Don't forget it. Um, so there's this,

63
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:35,210
it's not one thing or two things or three
things. This is like a bunch of them.

64
00:03:35,211 --> 00:03:37,020
He could imagine thinking,

65
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,630
going to throw someone from a
helicopter helicopter. But admittedly,

66
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,780
and I so, so he, he, he,

67
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:46,680
he's on youtube by the name of Sargon
of Akkad is a big account and I've

68
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,170
criticized him for being overly mean in
the past and I think it's exemplified by

69
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:52,870
angry, but, but he, he
is a very different now.

70
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:56,320
And I guess the reason I brought them up
was not very different now. How so? Well,

71
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:58,410
a lot of the content, he
makes as much calmer. He's,

72
00:03:58,411 --> 00:04:00,130
he's less likely to
insult someone directly.

73
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,390
He makes probably recognizing that
he's on his last straw. Oh, definitely.

74
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,440
Essentially kicked off of Twitter.
He's on Youtube.

75
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:09,050
He's probably got a mind his
p's and q's. Oh, but so, um,

76
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,260
the reason I brought him up again,

77
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,610
but we'll move on was that activists
found a livestream from eight months ago.

78
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,970
I totally forgot why I was bringing it
up because we've moved so far away from

79
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:20,820
where we were. But, um, they,

80
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:25,100
they pulled a clip from an hour and a
half or whatever into a two hour live

81
00:04:25,101 --> 00:04:26,110
stream on a small channel.

82
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:30,100
They only had 2000 views sent to
Patrion and then Patriot said, yep,

83
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,340
that's a violation and banned him out.
Right. Without warning. Which again,

84
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:36,160
I understand it's different from what you
guys do. You do suspensions first. But,

85
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:40,220
uh, I guess the reason I was bringing
up was to talk about a few things. Um,

86
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,030
why blocking isn't enough,
why muting isn't enough.

87
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,850
And if you think that it's
driving people off the platform,

88
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,260
people post my tweets on Reddit, I
blocked them, they use a dummy account,

89
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:54,070
load up my tweet, post it to reddit and
then spam me on reddit. So you know,

90
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:57,430
blocking and even leaving Twitter would
never do anything short of me shutting

91
00:04:57,431 --> 00:05:00,160
up. There's nothing you can do
to protect me or anyone else.

92
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,720
Look, I mean, these are exactly the
conversations we're having are one,

93
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,400
the reason why I don't think blocking
and reading or enough is one,

94
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,080
I don't think we've made mute powerful
enough. It's spread all over the service.

95
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,910
Uh, you, you can use it and then you
got to go find where you actually meet.

96
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,420
These people are under their profile
page and that's just, uh, it's not a,

97
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,830
it's a disaster. It just doesn't work
in the same way that it should work.

98
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:28,760
In the same way that follow works,
which is just the inverse event,

99
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,840
I noticed that now I get
a notification that says,

100
00:05:30,841 --> 00:05:32,070
you can't see this tweet
because you meet it.

101
00:05:32,071 --> 00:05:35,880
This person right before I would just
see a weird reply and be like, oh,

102
00:05:35,881 --> 00:05:37,170
it's one of those. Exactly. So

103
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,680
there's also all this infrastructure
that we have to fix in order to like pass

104
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:45,760
those through in terms of what action
you took or what action someone else

105
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:50,740
talked to be transparent about what's
happening on the network. The second, um,

106
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,660
the second thing that block is
really interesting. I think it's,

107
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:56,494
uh,

108
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:01,740
my view is it's wholly an unsatisfying
because what you're doing is your

109
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,070
blocking someone. They get notification
that you've blocked them, uh,

110
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:10,640
which may embolden them even
more, which causes, you know,

111
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,970
others around and ramifications from,
from the network.

112
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:19,340
But also that person can log out of
Twitter and then look at your tweets.

113
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,520
Uh,
just on the public web because we're,

114
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,820
we're public so it doesn't feel
as as rigorous and as durable.

115
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,160
Something like making mute much stronger.

116
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,290
I guess the challenge is no
matter what rule you put in place,

117
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,150
people are going to
harass you if you're a,

118
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,130
if you're engaging in public discourse,
you know,

119
00:06:35,131 --> 00:06:37,680
if I go out in the street
and yell out my opinion,

120
00:06:37,681 --> 00:06:41,610
somebody could get in my face if I get
off Twitter cause I'm sick. I mean look,

121
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:45,030
you know, I'm sure you get a way more
than I do, especially as you know,

122
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,900
the high profile probably getting it
right now. Yeah, totally. Oh me too. God,

123
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:52,380
I can only imagine, but so, so
the only thing I can do is, look,

124
00:06:52,381 --> 00:06:53,340
we're not on Twitter right now.

125
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,670
We're on Joe Rogan's podcast and they're
still going to target you on Twitter.

126
00:06:56,671 --> 00:06:59,600
They're still going to, I guarantee
we're all of a reddit. The the,

127
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,290
the leftest probably railing on me, the
rights wailing on you guys. So it's, it's,

128
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,330
it seems like even if you try everything
in your power to make Twitter healthier

129
00:07:06,331 --> 00:07:08,280
and better,
it's not going to change anything

130
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,970
that I'm not sure about that because one
of the things that I do think is that

131
00:07:12,971 --> 00:07:13,804
just,

132
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:19,250
I'm not in favor of a lot of this heavy
handed banning and a lot of the things

133
00:07:19,391 --> 00:07:23,050
that have been going on particular
like a case like the Megan Murphy case.

134
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,380
But what I think that
we are doing is we're,

135
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:32,130
we're exploring the idea of civil
discourse where we're trying to figure out

136
00:07:32,711 --> 00:07:36,910
what's acceptable and what's
not acceptable and you're
communicating about this

137
00:07:36,911 --> 00:07:41,080
on a very large scale and it's putting
that out there and then people are

138
00:07:41,081 --> 00:07:45,510
discussing it whether they agree or
disagree with a vehemently defend you or,

139
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:49,660
or hate you.
They're discussing this and this is,

140
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:53,590
I think this is how these things change
and they change over long periods of

141
00:07:53,591 --> 00:07:54,070
time.

142
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:59,070
Think about words that were commonplace
just a few years ago that you literally

143
00:07:59,621 --> 00:08:01,870
can't say anymore.
Right. You know, I mean,

144
00:08:01,871 --> 00:08:06,550
there's so many of them that
were extremely commonplace
or not even thought to

145
00:08:06,551 --> 00:08:10,540
be offensive 10 years ago,
that now you can get banned off

146
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,800
well, soaps for, but that's,

147
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:16,240
that's a good point to argue against
banning people and to cease enforcing hate

148
00:08:16,241 --> 00:08:19,870
speech rules. I agree with that
as well. I think it's both things.
