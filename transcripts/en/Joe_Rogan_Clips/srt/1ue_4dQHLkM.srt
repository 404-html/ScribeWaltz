1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,430
Hello Freak bitches. Yeah.
Most people think Oj did.

2
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:07,980
It does a few people that think
like I heard the crazy ones like,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,320
oh j son did or something
like that. I'm like, what?

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,270
I'm so balls deep in the Oj
stuff. Anything he does, I
watch it. But like I said,

5
00:00:15,271 --> 00:00:18,450
my brother went, God, I Went, God,

6
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:21,360
I wish I really knew the truth about
o j and j. My brother looks me goes,

7
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:24,330
are you shitting me? Like,
we all know the truth, man.

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,930
But people put all these different
stories out there where you're like, God,

9
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:31,440
maybe you didn't do it, but I just want
to know for a fact like that. Like what?

10
00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:34,290
How did it really go down? Do you think
he's ever going to come out and be like,

11
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,450
listen, no, no, I don't think he did.

12
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:38,610
I don't think he necessarily
remembers anymore.

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,380
You think he was just in a frenzy?

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,560
I think it's entirely possible that he's
a sociopath and a narcissist with brain

15
00:00:45,631 --> 00:00:47,220
trauma from trauma.

16
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,180
And I think that a lot
of times narcissists and
sociopaths like to that degree,

17
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,110
like he's just charming the world.
Hey, I'm Oj Simpson. I'm a good guy.

18
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,280
I've always been a good guy.
Basically they have a conflict free life.

19
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:03,230
Yo Ass want to go be with my family.
Got sounds like a man.

20
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,150
He's got a weird thing going on man.

21
00:01:05,151 --> 00:01:08,430
Like he's trying to paint this image
all day long of him being a good guy.

22
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:12,680
Me while he's got these demons and
knows dad was gay and they say it.

23
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,740
That's why you beat like a lot
like you so upset about that. See,

24
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,560
I don't trust that guy. But
when he gave that, uh, anyone,

25
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,080
he's like snapped at the judge.
Yeah,

26
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,170
it was super weird and you definitely
shouldn't do that when you're trying to

27
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:28,290
get what he'd snap on. I got upset
about something that I'm on something.

28
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,650
He's like, I said I wasn't
there or something like,
yeah, yeah. I forget what it,

29
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,920
what it was like the Las Vegas Room
definitely didn't handle it well. Who?

30
00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:39,200
Look man, when you're a man and you're
locked up with other men, you know,

31
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,170
as prisoners all day long forever.
It's just,

32
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,910
it's a horrific existence.

33
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,350
It's amazing that he was able to get
through it at all and then still pull off

34
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:52,130
that kind of charm and not
can only suicide. Yeah.

35
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,190
They said he was killing it in there.
Like he was the prime example of a,

36
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,260
of a prisoner and it was like he started
organizing church groups and like

37
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,840
feeding everyone's lunches
and like, he was cool. Wow.

38
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,840
Well find meaning in that shit.
I wonder if you'd like,

39
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:11,020
has like a deep what's going
on? He's Chloe's dad. Yeah.

40
00:02:11,021 --> 00:02:14,100
A lot of people think he's closed.
That get the fuck out of here. What?

41
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,750
Chloe's not half black. Uh, well
they just don't love black guys.

42
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:23,580
They is that what it is? Hmm.
Some people do well and you know,

43
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,370
Oj was super close with strong
rumour Kardashians. Strong rumor.

44
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:32,290
That strong room. No one would
be surprised. Uh, I would,

45
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,090
well, my point was like, what
kind of memory of the event? Okay.

46
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:42,540
We both agree he did it right. So if he
did it, what kind of memory does he have?

47
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:46,680
Do you remember sticking
the knife in them? You'll
remember that traumatic event.

48
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,000
I wonder,
I wonder,

49
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,150
I wonder if you're a sociopath and I
wonder if you've been telling people for

50
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:52,710
all these years that you're innocent.

51
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,530
I'm all you remap trying
to find the real killer.

52
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,620
I'm trying to get out of
it upon the real killer.

53
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:01,600
Everyone's all and not once did
he bring up the real killer.

54
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,810
I'm trying to find my wife's
killer. The reason why, I mean,

55
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,230
he never said that during any of the
parole thing when he can't want it to get

56
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:12,340
out. Oh No, not on my wife's killer. Yeah.
Never on this. Someone killed my wife.

57
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:15,640
That ship's sailed was time me.
I'm being tried for it.

58
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:18,640
I'm being unjustly accused.
He just say the case that I lost,

59
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,930
he came out with a book. If I
did it. Yeah, he was going to,

60
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,950
but he didn't release that book.
I thought he did none.

61
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,220
All the proceeds went to the,
the gold. No. Um, I believe,

62
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,690
I'm pretty sure that the
publishing company backed
out of that private smart on

63
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:36,280
their part.
Yeah.

64
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,820
You can't do that while you
have them on the podcast.

65
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,430
Oh,

66
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,730
I don't know if he would do it, but
if he did do it. Yeah, I have them on.

67
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,560
Yeah. Right yet have to
have mine. I did it shit up.

68
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,250
IDF is right. It's hidden right there.
Remember that's what they had did.

69
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,220
Oh that's right.

70
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:03,440
If I did it in the eye and
on Amazon by j Simpson.

71
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,660
Jesus Christ. That's, that's still,

72
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,010
I thought they pulled that
confessions of the killer in all caps.

73
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,570
Goldman and Kim Goldman.
Nick. That's how it happened.

74
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:18,750
They had to they're they're getting
money. Yeah. They get all the money,

75
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:19,611
all the money.

76
00:04:19,611 --> 00:04:24,020
But in did he really right the full
story or are the rights to them?

77
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,870
Yeah,
because double jeopardy right

78
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,770
off the crime is sorta what it is.
How much money do,

79
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,710
and also they have a
civil case against him.

80
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,260
How much money do you think
he made off that book?

81
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,770
Cause you don't make that much money
off books unless you're just fucking,

82
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,360
you do feel like Bill O'reilly,
j k Rollins or some shit. Yeah.

83
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,910
If you're writing books like old
people read, they buy a lot of books.

84
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,050
If I did it and we kind of know how
you'd do it. If he did it. Is it,

85
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:56,120
I need to read the knife. Stab both of
them go to Chicago, called the lawyers,

86
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,310
come back, come back, act dumb.

87
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,830
Kardashian helps me out. Rinse,
repeat. Does it say how many books?

88
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:09,020
So many books they sold.
I got to think it was not much.

89
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,570
I don't even know it was
out and I'm all about this.

90
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,870
He got some sort of crazy settlement.
Right?

91
00:05:14,871 --> 00:05:18,470
It was like $35 million settlement
or something like that. 33 million.

92
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,960
But how much has he been paid?

93
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:27,750
I used to know is um, um,
Ron Goldman sister. Really?

94
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,610
Yeah. What do you, how'd you know her?

95
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:34,680
She worked on something that I did for,
she was very nice,

96
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,491
very cool check.

97
00:05:35,491 --> 00:05:40,491
Brian ran into the dad in
Phoenix selling men's shirts.

98
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:45,360
Like what's the big paws ans I was
trying to think what his selling,

99
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:47,820
but I remember seeing like
men's golf shirts or some shit.

100
00:05:47,821 --> 00:05:51,870
Like the struggle is real for Ron
Goldman, you know, like game over,

101
00:05:51,871 --> 00:05:54,330
you lose a child and it
goes down like that. Just,

102
00:05:54,331 --> 00:05:58,610
just hard believe that that guy's
now going to get out. What do you do?

103
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:02,000
I mean you only got certain amount
of time left on this planet. I,

104
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,060
I'd probably get a hand
probably hammer beat.

105
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,450
It's going to be tough to get Oj still
pretty athletic and black. So I would,

106
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,800
I'd probably get a gun
and when he gets out,

107
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,350
drive down to Florida or if he comes
back to Brentwood skin to make it super

108
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:17,430
easy on you and probably shoot him,

109
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,670
could be headed to reality
TV. When I called, Oh mine

110
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,830
watching that documentary
about him completely.

111
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,110
I completely forgot about all the weird
stuff he was doing before he did go to

112
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:34,040
jail. Just show in Vegas where he
had, I didn't even know about it.

113
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:37,200
Seeing it on the documentary shows
everything I had to wrap. Yeah,

114
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,710
you gotta Wrap Saran wrap.
So after he murdered his wife,

115
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,860
right before he went to
jail and like 2005 or six,

116
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:48,830
um,
innocence to the gross

117
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,700
is innocent.

118
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,510
Are we going to get pulled off of Youtube
for the Oj Simpson away? Look at this.

119
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:04,160
Oh my God. Wait a minute. We got to play
this. Let's, let's ride. Let's ride this.

120
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,380
Give us some fine.
Oh my God.

121
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,913
These girls

122
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,360
have titties out.
This is real.

123
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:26,840
This is a real music video.
America's most wanted.

124
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,630
This is crazy. He's dressed like
Elvis. I can't believe this is real.

125
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,693
Oh

126
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,460
look, those steady gimme some volume
here. People hear this, right?

127
00:07:47,461 --> 00:07:51,600
People on Youtube are Hannah's.
No. Oh, it will get taken down.

128
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:55,080
Probably not for you.
Play just the audio way.

129
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,820
Oj Simpson get juiced.
What year did this happen?

130
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:03,150
Like 2004.
2005

131
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,010
this is insane.

132
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,140
This is insane. It's all these
girls taking their pants off.

133
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:21,260
So he was doing a prank show and you
got juice was the tag line. Oh my God.

134
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,780
He did it. He did a fucking prank
show after he murdered two people.

135
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,710
He's got a midget on his lap. This
is insane. I can't believe it.

136
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,790
I've seen this. Oh my God.
All you player haters.

137
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,040
Yeah.

138
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,640
Get on your knees and get some of these,
grabbed his crotch.

139
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,550
He said these nuts.
This is crazy.

140
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,640
And you got to think,
is this 2005 is that what you said?

141
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,830
So he's gotta be like 60 years
old when this is happening. Damn.

142
00:08:54,831 --> 00:08:56,220
It only has 15,000

143
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,700
views on youtube and check
in in a couple of days.

144
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,390
We just helped the Jews don't
think people knew about it,

145
00:09:04,391 --> 00:09:07,760
but another reason he needs to come on
the God damn podcast. Yeah. Maybe to him.

146
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,520
Come on dressed like Elvis again. No, no.
Maybe would come on justice white face.

147
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:14,700
God Damn, this is nuts.
He's a terrible divorce.

148
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,720
I wonder if he was like, look, I really,

149
00:09:17,721 --> 00:09:21,410
I make money and so on through this idea
of him. Look at him with a do rag him.

150
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,470
Yeah. Don't piss them
off though. Very strange.

151
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,500
You did a Bingo at like a white
face with like a security.

152
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,890
Oh my God.
The struggle is real.

153
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:40,070
This is so strange.
I can't believe this.

154
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,820
This rap song where it's like it's hot
in the streets in La. That is true.

155
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,820
Yeah. He was like a legit wrap flung
though. This is the remix, Jamie.

156
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,250
It's got a good point.
Both of them are good.

157
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,470
We don't need to watch anything on a
terrible person. I wonder what he's,

158
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,390
I mean, I feel like a guy like that
probably like would do anything.

159
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,931
It's like this is good.

160
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:06,270
We've got to figure out some way to do
and who's going to be working with them?

161
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:10,580
You're not going to get like the top minds
of Hollywood. Fuck no, no one's, I mean,

162
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:14,940
he might pop up on some reality show,
but dude, a matching knows hoes.

163
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,460
They were saying he was getting more
women than ever when he got out,

164
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,550
like when he was out of trial,
they still went to Florida,

165
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,220
was just Dick and girls down now,
like recently

166
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:25,443
killing it.

167
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,360
What ties got out?
What type of site

168
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:28,930
cool

169
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,720
chicks are hooking up with Oj right now.
Skanks

170
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,800
[inaudible].
