1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,700
You are getting into the movie business,
right? You've been doing a few movies.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,640
Why aren't you doing a movie during the
time you were doing the Rockhold fight?

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,480
That's right. Yeah, I was filming
trip relax. Um, yeah. Yeah.

4
00:00:09,481 --> 00:00:14,481
I've been out there for about three months
and then I was flying home and I was

5
00:00:14,491 --> 00:00:17,520
looking for some walkie talkies
for my seven year old. Uh,

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,650
I don't know why I thought
that'd be a good idea.

7
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:22,290
It turns out getting hold of walkie
talkies isn't very easy these days.

8
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:25,140
I've went on a fucking wild goose chase
trying to get these fucking walkie

9
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:27,660
talkies that didn't even get played
with. He was like, yeah, cool.

10
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:32,400
I've got a phone dad. I like, yeah, I
should have thought of that. But um,

11
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,320
and as I'm looking for them,
I check Twitter,

12
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:38,480
I've got a coffee and I see Chris Weidman
and pulled out. So yeah, it takes Dana.

13
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,480
I said, listen, if this is true, you know,
you know where I am. And he was like,

14
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:46,350
oh great, we love that, you know, blah
blah blah, blah blah. But Jack Arrays,

15
00:00:46,351 --> 00:00:49,500
our first option.
So I thought for a minute there,

16
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:51,990
I thought I was getting a towel shot and
I thought there's no way Jackie Ray's

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:52,860
going to turn it down.

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,960
So I went to my buddy's Jason's house
and watched a basketball game and had a

19
00:00:57,961 --> 00:01:00,930
few drinks and you know,
it didn't party as such.

20
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:02,730
I was on set the next
day but had a few drinks.

21
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,970
Now if I knew I was fighting for a
world belt in two weeks, you know,

22
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:07,410
I would have been on a strict diet,

23
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,230
not overindulging but I definitely
overindulged and then the next day and

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,840
walking into the gym just have,
you know,

25
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:17,820
and just a little light workout and my
phone starts exploding lighting up like a

26
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:21,450
Christmas tree and like what the hell?
And then our aerial Hawaiian, he calls me.

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,290
Is that Mike Dana just announced with
sports center that you find for the belt?

28
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:32,940
I was the first I heard about it. I love
fucking Dana. We all, God bless him.

29
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,000
So, um, that whole shit. So I'm panicking
like crazy. How much did you work?

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,190
That's the first thing I did. I ran into
the changing rooms. Got on the scale.

31
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:45,180
I was at two 15, two 16 cause
that rough. Yeah, for sure. Yeah.

32
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:48,360
I like to do like a week
before I like to be 200 pounds.

33
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,630
So this is two weeks before and I'm 215
so much shit screwed the weights and

34
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,670
need to run.
So I just run out at the gym,

35
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,780
throw my backpack on my shoulders and
just of sprinting through Toronto city

36
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:03,840
center, like a mad man. Of course
there's traffic lights every 30 seconds.

37
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,360
So I don't want to stop at the
traffic lights cause that's no good.

38
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:07,320
So I'm just running out,

39
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,040
nearly getting run over by
taxis and jumping off of
homeless people falling over

40
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,600
docking and dive. And it was great
training. And then Dana called,

41
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:17,120
who's I'm negotiating,
you know,

42
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,030
the Fi whilst running
through Toronto and then, uh,

43
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,620
carried on going and then I ended
up like in the middle of nowhere.

44
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:27,450
I just running and running and running
and then Jason Parillo gets on the phone

45
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,340
and uh, you know, all the doubt starts
creeping in. I started thinking,

46
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:34,710
Jesus Christ is salt.
Typical of my career.

47
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,770
I've wanted at a towel fight
my whole career. You know,

48
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,080
I've been through many ups
and downs and now here I am,

49
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:44,010
I get the title fights on two weeks
notice that'd be filming a God damn movie.

50
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,600
I've been near a gym and a major in for
a while doing anything unless against

51
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:49,650
somebody that's already beaten me.

52
00:02:49,651 --> 00:02:52,980
So I'm kind of destined to
fail this soft fucking typical.

53
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,580
And then Jason got on the phone and you
know, he talked to me round big time.

54
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,530
You know,
I said a lot of very positive things.

55
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,710
Jason's an amazing coach is incredible.
It really is. There's a lot of,

56
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,120
it was a lot of trainers out there.
Uh, there's a lot of pad man. You know,

57
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:10,530
there's a lot of fakers in mixed martial
arts. Certainly these days. You know,

58
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,560
I mean guys that really have true heritage
in martial arts or any kind of steep

59
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:19,090
history in combat sports, they're
few and far between. Yeah. You know,

60
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:20,050
you can train.

61
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,470
Any guy can watch a video and
it's a little bit of coordination,

62
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,240
how to hold pads and you see them.
It's all the crazy, isn't it?

63
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:33,190
These days in pads to get fit, you know,
one, two left talk. Whew. You know,

64
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,570
just cause you can do that and hold pause
doesn't make you a coach does not make

65
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:41,050
you a coach and there's a lot of fakers
out there. But Jason is not one of them.

66
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,500
He speaks from the heart and he knows
what the fuck he's talking about.

67
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:48,460
And we had a good chat and by the end
of it I was, I was feeling a lot better.

68
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:52,930
And uh, yeah. So when you were filming
that movie, were you working out at all?

69
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,610
I was doing vanity workouts.

70
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,220
I like to run certainly
when I'm in a city.

71
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,870
So I was running probably three or
four days a week of 4.2 mile run. Yes.

72
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,190
So as I was running and I was lifting
weights a few times a week, you know,

73
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,510
biceps and shoulders. Right. You know
what I mean? Yeah. The chest, press luck,

74
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,140
lots of jazz press, you know
what I mean? Eh. And then, um,

75
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:21,340
GSPs coach Jorge Blanco. Do you know
Jorge? No, I don't. It's very, very,

76
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:25,570
very good trainer. Uh, Rashad Evans
put me onto him whilst I was up there.

77
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,250
I went to see him like two or three
times, you know, uh, but no, not,

78
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,450
not training as such, but uh, yeah,
all worked out. But that exercise,

79
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:35,980
but sometimes that's good anyway.
Right?

80
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:38,470
So it gives your body a chance to recover.
Well,

81
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:42,100
that's what I said afterwards because I
went into that fight feeling so strong,

82
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,040
feeling so good. I'm like, cause I,

83
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:48,850
I consistently over trend every single
fight in my career apart from that one.

84
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,650
Uh, and I said, oh, I'll learn from this.
I'll learn from this. And you don't,

85
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,770
and it's like Jason Parillo always says,
um,

86
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:02,500
it takes confidence to take a day
off to rest the body and you know,

87
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,880
and now of course there's a fine line
between having the confidence to take a

88
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,700
day off and being a lazy bastard. And,
and I'm going to sit on the couch today,

89
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,340
you know, but if you could,
if you know, listen, I'm good.

90
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,670
I'm going to take a day or two
off cause I need it, you know?

91
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,430
So that was one of the
mistakes I made with my career.

92
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:21,430
I always trained too much in Jason said,
you know,

93
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:25,600
I used to mind fuck myself because
it meant so much to me. You know,

94
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,750
my fight career meant so much to me.

95
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:31,220
I used to overcomplicate it
over analyze you overwork it,

96
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,750
stress myself out with it,
you know? And uh, that,

97
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,190
that was hindering my performances.
You know, I never once fought to the,

98
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,680
to my ability of what I performed
in the gym. Never once. Uh,

99
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:47,080
I remember one day I pulled up outside
Ruca the Jason was waiting for me outside

100
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,190
and I pulled up and he says,
Mike, come here, let me have
a quick chat. I said, yeah,

101
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:55,480
what's up? He said, listen, budget
go guys in there. Okay. He said,

102
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:57,440
but you're a fucking world champion.

103
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,880
Can you go in there and spar these
guys and act like a world champion?

104
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,110
They're here. You're up there.
Act like it. Don't go in,

105
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,260
lose your fucking Tempus Spaz out.
Stress out at like a day.

106
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,880
Say things you regret.
You know,

107
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:14,630
when the spine is not quite necessarily
going your way, you, you know,

108
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,030
you get a little pissed off or whatever,
you know,

109
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,300
say Jiu Jitsu coaches catching you and
tapping you out a little bit and you

110
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:23,180
start getting a little frustrated.
He said, can you just, you know,

111
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,270
how can we have none of
that place and great advice.

112
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,300
Just like when I was
fighting for the belt,

113
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:33,290
when I flew home from doing that movie,
I went straight to the gym when I landed.

114
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:38,630
And uh, Jason said to me,
cause I was always stressed,
you know, and he said, listen,

115
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,280
um, we don't know if you're going to win
this fight mag, you know, fingers crossed,

116
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,140
I believe in you.
I believe you're gonna win this fight,

117
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:46,910
but we don't know if you're
going to win this fight.

118
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:51,590
So this might be the only time you're
ever going to fight for a world title.

119
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:56,060
Right? I said, well, yeah,
parcel. But he said, well, let's
enjoy the process. You know,

120
00:06:56,061 --> 00:07:00,650
let's go through this with a smile on
your face. He said, this is huge. He said,

121
00:07:00,651 --> 00:07:04,070
you're in a position that everyone wa
would kill to be in your fighting for the

122
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,980
championship. You're fighting for
the belt. You've wanted this whole,

123
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,220
this your whole life,
enjoy this. You know,

124
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:14,000
and it was such amazing advice cause
I was like, yeah, you're right.

125
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,330
And I went through the whole thing
and the big smile on my face,

126
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:20,480
you clip Rockhold I remember thinking,
Holy Shit,

127
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:25,490
when I see rock holds legs buckle and I
see him stagger backwards. I was like,

128
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:27,650
Holy Shit.
He got him.

129
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,730
And then when he stumbled against the
cage and you bashed him and stopped him,

130
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,950
I'm going to help but laugh because it,
you know, it does bring a smile to her

131
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,360
almost like I couldn't believe it. It was
like a, like a movie. It was like, it was,

132
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,120
it was one of those things because you
were a big underdog coming to their fight.

133
00:07:43,121 --> 00:07:44,710
Everybody know you took
it on short notice.

134
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,460
Everybody knew that you were working on
a movie. And so for you to land that,

135
00:07:48,461 --> 00:07:51,010
when you landed that left hand,
you missed it once before too.

136
00:07:51,011 --> 00:07:54,760
And I remember thinking like, man, that
is fucking clothes. Like that's close.

137
00:07:54,761 --> 00:07:57,740
Like you saw this opening
for that left hand and you,

138
00:07:57,741 --> 00:08:01,360
you clipped him over the top of the
shoulder. It didn't see it. Common Bang,

139
00:08:01,361 --> 00:08:05,350
you drop that left hand on his chin and
he see like his eyes roll back and his

140
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:07,540
legs give out.
Fuck man.

141
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,810
Well that was the whole plan,
the left Hook, you know,

142
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,660
Jason and seeing that he was open for
that and I'd seen he was open for that and

143
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:18,160
he was even doing this exercise on these
bands are like our resistance bands,

144
00:08:18,161 --> 00:08:20,650
whatever it was doing this.
And his chin was open.

145
00:08:20,651 --> 00:08:23,450
His right hand was down at the end of it.
And Jason said he's,

146
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:27,670
he's Julian needs moves here and he's
finishing here a left hook all day long.

147
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,380
And um,
you know,

148
00:08:29,381 --> 00:08:32,260
he's coming forward and where we're
exchanging punches and nothing really

149
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:36,550
significant as Landon. And I just ran out
to the body, just whipped the left talk.

150
00:08:36,551 --> 00:08:40,210
And you know, as a fire, when you,
when you land the good shot you,

151
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,660
cause you get the feedback on your fist.
There's nothing like it.

152
00:08:43,661 --> 00:08:45,670
You know what I mean? When,
when you, when you feel that,

153
00:08:45,671 --> 00:08:48,910
that solid connection and the knuckles
got through the glove, you know,

154
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:52,870
and you feel it, you're like,
oh that was a good vibe.

155
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,910
And then we falls down. I'm
like, Holy Shit, hold on.

156
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,120
And then he gets back up on that, fuck
you, boom, back down. And then, uh,

157
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,590
he went down and obviously it's got
very good Jujitsu and he was kind of sat

158
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:07,050
back against the fence and I thought
I've got to be careful not to go in his

159
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:09,510
guard, but uh, yeah, I got the finish.

160
00:09:09,511 --> 00:09:14,511
Felt the best feeling I've ever felt in
my life was big John Mccarthy's gigantic

161
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:19,410
forearm, nearly pulling my head off my
shoulders as he wrestled me off him.

162
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:21,840
But he knew it was over cause I
knew it was over. It was great.

163
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,890
What did that feel like
when you knew you did it?

164
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,270
One of the best feelings in the world?
One of the best, because, you know,

165
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:34,290
for me the amount of fights
I've had is unbelievable,

166
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,900
professionally and unprofessionally,
you know, and when I was a kid,

167
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:40,170
that's all I was,
you know,

168
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:44,310
that that was my only identity has been
a fire, you know, and just being that,

169
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,230
that guy, you know, unfortunately,
rightly or wrongly, wrongly, wrongly,

170
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,470
you know, of course it is,
you know, I was, I was a
fucking idiot when I was a kid.

171
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,250
I was fighting so much, but
that's what I clung to, you know,

172
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,960
I was a fire and that was the only thing
that I could draw pride from, you know,

173
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,770
and, uh, be becoming the world champion,

174
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:08,790
knowing that everybody wrote me off
knowing that everyone talk shit about me,

175
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,560
you know, uh, other fighters
just, just, you know,

176
00:10:13,561 --> 00:10:17,460
it was everywhere you, he, I heard
what people always said about me.

177
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:21,480
Do you know what I mean? So to, to win
lie that in style and the first one. Yeah.

178
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:26,040
Yeah. It felt amazing. There it
is right there. Oh yeah. Yeah.

179
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,510
Rock was very upset. Yeah,
he was. Yeah. You know,

180
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,660
you talked a lot of shit too and you, and
after you beat him, well, well hold on.

181
00:10:33,661 --> 00:10:36,930
I know my wife was beyond me there and
she deserves a shout out because if it

182
00:10:36,931 --> 00:10:39,090
wasn't for her and none of this
would've happened, but, uh,

183
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,690
with Rockhold with what happened
after the fight. So I, okay,

184
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:45,780
there's a few things that I regret that
have heard after the fact. First of all,

185
00:10:45,781 --> 00:10:48,690
I'd jump on the fence and I'm just so
worried or persecuting up, fuck you,

186
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:52,740
whatever. No big deal. I'm not, I'm
not too concerned about that one. Um,

187
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,920
and then as I'm doing my lap of
victory dance, if you will, um,

188
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,730
I do a lap of the octagon
and I cross paths with,

189
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:04,140
with Luke part of me and
I'm like, Hey, you know,

190
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:09,080
you say whatever you say,
unlucky bird, you know, a good
fire, whatever. Bubba, Bubba,

191
00:11:09,081 --> 00:11:09,990
bubba.
I said that.

192
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:14,250
And I carried on having my mom and I
was just out of my mind on Adrenalin and

193
00:11:14,251 --> 00:11:16,650
just having a great time.
And then I found myself,

194
00:11:16,651 --> 00:11:20,070
I'd done an entire lap of the octagon
again and I was passing him again.

195
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,640
So I just thought I'd extended my currency
one more time. I'm like, yeah, you know,

196
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,990
and I put my hand out and he
said, I already shook your
hand. I'm like, oh, really?

197
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,540
You're still going to be a decade? Is
that yet? I already shook your hand.

198
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:33,740
So then I was like, okay,
well now the gloves are off.
I said, don't worry about it.

199
00:11:33,741 --> 00:11:36,090
You in an octagon, you've just
been knocked out. It's okay.

200
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,240
You'll figure it out in a minute. Don't
worry about it. You'll come to both,

201
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,103
you'll be good.

202
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,350
So I kind of look like an ass or because
people didn't see that he wouldn't,

203
00:11:43,351 --> 00:11:45,720
he refused to shake my hand the
second time, you know? I was like,

204
00:11:45,721 --> 00:11:46,800
well go fuck yourself then.

205
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:52,050
And then when you give me the microphone
when you gave it the microphone, I said,

206
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:55,870
the most crude comment I'm at, I've been
fighting ever since I care about it.

207
00:11:55,871 --> 00:11:57,520
My mother, I'm like, Whoa,

208
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:02,200
that's that an image that I want to
portray to the world with a window. Well,

209
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:05,440
belt, you know, what I meant
was ever since I've been
born. Right. You know, but in,

210
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:10,441
in the moment the word's escaped me a
little bit and then I painted a rather

211
00:12:11,681 --> 00:12:15,640
disturbing image of my mother giving
birth to me. But uh, but yeah. Yeah.

212
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:18,820
I didn't choose my words too
carefully though, but uh,
yeah, no, it was great man.

213
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,880
Well, you can't be held accountable
for that. I mean, that's it.

214
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:25,060
There's no one that's ever going to
be able to understand that other than

215
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:27,850
someone who wins the title,
no one's gonna know what that felt like.

216
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:31,990
It's impossible eating. It was
incredible. He really was. It really was.

217
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:38,270
I can only imagine it was good while it
was good. I'm just happy that for you, uh,

218
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:38,680
you know,

219
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,970
having a chance to see all your fights
and see your career go for as long as it

220
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,070
went that you did go out
with a title that is,

221
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,590
yeah, for sure. Yeah. You
know, I mean, as I say a,

222
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,640
that was for me, I'm not sure.
Well, I wouldn't have retired.

223
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,870
I wouldn't have retired. Yeah,
yeah. No, no, because that, cause I,

224
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,340
I'd know I could still do it. I can still
find now, you know, I can still, but,

225
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,310
but the time was right. You know? And
then I started having issues with,

226
00:13:05,311 --> 00:13:05,820
my goodness.
