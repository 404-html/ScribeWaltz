00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:04,860
Hello Freak bitches schedule
on Saturday and Sunday.

2
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:08,220
Do you allow yourself some leisure?
I'll sleep as long as I want.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,120
And I listened to different records
during the week. I listened,

4
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:16,200
I do protein listening, which is records
I haven't heard yet. And so just,

5
00:00:16,201 --> 00:00:18,150
you know, you have to really
concentrate on the weekend.

6
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:19,440
I do carbohydrate listening,

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,880
whereas records that I'm familiar with
that I just like to listen to. How so?

8
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:26,730
Just like a sort of a light
thing. Well, just like songs,

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,260
albums I've had for 25 years that I
still like to listen to. And that's like,

10
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:31,441
you know,

11
00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:36,441
Chile and soup and bread and potatoes and
then during the week it's Shashimi and

12
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,990
clap pushups. You know what
a strange life you have, man.

13
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,450
Yeah, yeah. It's very original. I'll tell
you that. It's different. Yeah. If you're,

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,670
you know, be weird. Live.
Where'd you know? Weird is
this weird does, I guess? Well,

15
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:53,490
you get involved in relationships and you
getting a girlfriend or something like

16
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:57,120
that and they realize they're
getting involved with, they're like,

17
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,120
oh Jesus Christ, who is more
what I'm getting involved with.

18
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:04,110
And I realize I can't hack it because
here's the awful thing about being an

19
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:08,190
adult in a relationship, just seeking
to be an adult in a relationship.

20
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,450
I have found when I was young and
I was a boy and I was dating girls,

21
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,220
it's boys and girls and she's an idiot.
You're an idiot.

22
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,700
You do dumb things and
when cheats and whatever,

23
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,600
then you hit a certain part of your life
where she's a woman and you're a man

24
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:26,601
and you have adult expectations and you
can't be running around being an idiot

25
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:32,520
with someone who kind of wants you to be
at the table because they are sincerely

26
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:37,050
giving time of their adult life to this
thing that you were doing together and

27
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:41,130
when you come in still thinking you're
in ninth grade and she's coming in like

28
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,500
this is part of what my life is,
is being with you.

29
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,220
I have never been able to answer that
in a mature enough way to where I would

30
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:59,071
have been able to maintain it because
like say next weekend if I had a

31
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:03,240
girlfriend, she might say, it's Friday.
What are we doing? I'm like, oh,

32
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:08,190
watching me write for four hours.
And so that's not the way to be.

33
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:09,120
You can't do that.

34
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,950
And so I can't be a good persons
other half because I'm always,

35
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,010
the work has always attracted me
more than coming home to someone.

36
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:24,120
Wow. Like, I can't stand the idea
of someone of living with a person.

37
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,330
I can do it on the bus cause it's
das boat. And we're like, you know,

38
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,390
going down the road. Um, but I,

39
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:35,391
I never would want to like wake up
and she's there and I have no aversion

40
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:44,050
to, they look to your
right. She said, well,

41
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,380
it's every day here we are together,
just not wired that way.

42
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,820
I would be a drag. Like, you haven't
spoken to me in 20 hours. Huh?

43
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,940
I didn't notice. And I'm just
a work oriented. And so, and I,

44
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,790
I'm not interested in wasting anyone's
time. I'm not interested in being mean.

45
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,240
I'm really not into it. And so I, I'm not,

46
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:11,290
the woman was hitting on meal
while ago and I said, ma'am,

47
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:17,170
I'll call her ma'am. That's a problem.
She was very persistent. And I, I said,

48
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:22,150
ma'am, um, I'm like a
hunting dog. I'm a dog.

49
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,090
Just not the kind you pat,
you know, I'm just not,

50
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,710
I'm just, I'm sorry. Uh,

51
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,890
you should stop because she's
imagining holding your hand,

52
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:34,970
coming to your spoken word shows,
going on,

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,670
going to dinner with you and talking
about your day and you're like in front of

54
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:42,560
your fucking crazy speakers
and your writing and yeah.

55
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,670
Hoping the phone doesn't ring right.
Uh,

56
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,750
I unplug it on the weekends except on
Sunday. My best friend, since I was a 11,

57
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,170
12 and he was 11, we're
still best friends. He,

58
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,470
you ever heard of the band flew Ghazi?
Yes. Okay. Well, Ian Mci, the like,

59
00:03:56,471 --> 00:03:59,740
he's my best friend and we grew up
together doing music and everything and we

60
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:02,020
talk almost every Sunday. And so, uh,

61
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:05,800
we've been best friends since
the Carter Administration. Wow.

62
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,910
And so Ian will call on Sunday,
we'll talk for a while.

63
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:14,130
Otherwise the phone doesn't ring. If
it does, I'm like, oh no. Why? Well,

64
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,650
I thought you liked me.
Why are you calling? And so

65
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,790
I,
I thought you liked,

66
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,520
if you liked me, he wouldn't
write me. But meanwhile I'm,

67
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:32,020
I'm contentedly just working away.

68
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,340
Okay.
Yeah.
