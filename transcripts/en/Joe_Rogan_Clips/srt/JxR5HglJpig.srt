1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,100
And it's funny because when
people see old pictures of me,

2
00:00:02,101 --> 00:00:03,660
they say I either look like the Jersey,

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,640
like a jersey shore wannabe or like a
backstreet boys wanted me cause I looked

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,440
like, cause I had the earrings in
and I had the hair totally spite.

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,010
And yet that was the style at the time
we were also running a risk because

6
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:17,430
you've got like a little bit of
facial hair. Yeah. Yeah. I don't have,

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,810
it's not very masculine. No a beard,
but she's got something going on.

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,440
It's definitely a man or you're a woman
undergoing hormone replacement therapy.

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,680
You got that Chaz Bono type thing.
It's um,

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,120
this is called a lazy man's beard because
I can't even even really grow a beard.

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,130
So it's just this is what
it is when I get lazy.

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,440
You got a little something going
on though? Yeah, I guess so.

13
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,770
Maybe it's the finasteride just
had the mustache itself though.

14
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:42,450
It be kind of creepy.
No mustaches.

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,110
I'm going on a jihad against mustache
just because I think for whatever reason

16
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:49,730
they look more ridiculous than
full facial hair. I don't know why.

17
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:54,600
Some people like, like Sam Elliott, the
actor. I don't know who that is. I know.

18
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,970
I know Tom Selleck, so I've seen
roadhouse. Which guy is it in row?

19
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:02,750
Sam Elliott. Everybody knows who that's
not the main character. Patrick Swayze.

20
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:07,800
Oh my. Yeah, but he's got the, he's
got the fucking mustached. What a man.

21
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,550
But the GRANDPA vibe going on that
he didn't always go to roadhouse.

22
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,560
Go to look at that. Sam
Elliott. He's a great voice.

23
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,490
Nobody's blowing him
because he has a mustache.

24
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,900
Easy blow his fucking game area.
Look at that.

25
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,500
Come on. Yeah, I mean with the,

26
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,170
the hair right there. Right there.
That's him and roadhouse. Yeah,

27
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,270
but that's a full beard. That's
more of a full beard. That's true.

28
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,200
And that looks better on them.
I Dunno. Look at that. Oh,

29
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:41,460
come on now. I don't think a go to
that. I got that one right there.

30
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,880
I don't think a goatee looks as
ridiculous as a mustache alone.

31
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,110
Some guys can pull it off. It's
a bold choice, but it can't look,

32
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,010
you can't look overly Archie with it.
You know what I mean?

33
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,170
You can't or you can't.
No you can't. If you're,

34
00:01:55,171 --> 00:02:00,030
if it looks like you're tied to your
goatee as a matter of your identity,

35
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,290
then it's a problem.

36
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,740
But if it's just a dude who seems like
he's rocking a goatee cause he just

37
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:06,570
decided one day to rock a goatee,
then it's all right.

38
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,140
You know what kind of died out the
soul patch, the soul patch. Yeah.

39
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,690
I haven't seen one of those in forever.
You know, that kind of went away.

40
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,690
Did you ever have any facial
hair? No beard, just beards.

41
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,670
I grew up way out at one
point in time because a,

42
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,490
there's a guy named Evan Tanner who was
a MMA fighter that was known for having

43
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:24,660
a big, thick, crazy beard.

44
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:28,110
He was a really interesting
guy and he really nice guy too.

45
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:30,480
And he died in,
um,

46
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:35,570
he went on sort of a walkabout and
decided to go in death valley and camp out

47
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,670
and um,
he ran out of water.

48
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:42,450
It couldn't find his water and
any wound up dying from heat.

49
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,110
And a lot of us were
pretty broken up about it.

50
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:49,950
So a bunch of people online decided to
grow out our beards for a certain amount

51
00:02:49,951 --> 00:02:53,940
of months. That's me with a full
beard. Wow. So you get a an almost,

52
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,270
you could get a caveman beard going if
you want it. Oh yeah. I get a full beard.

53
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,010
Yeah. And that's me trimming
around the cheeks because my shit,

54
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:05,140
my shit creeps all the way up to
my nostrils. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

55
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:07,000
I grew that out for a couple of months.

56
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,870
I forget how long we decided
to go look at, you know,

57
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,280
what are you doing? Listen, that was
when he wanted to play Robert Shapiro.

58
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,290
Didn't he do that for the Oj movie?

59
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,560
I feel like it was okay. Maybe
it's just, yeah, that this,

60
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:27,380
uh, verifies every single, you
know, whisper about John Travolta,

61
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:31,060
tickle a ball. Tickets.
That's what it is. Just to,

62
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,090
it's right there for tickle him balls.
Anyway.
