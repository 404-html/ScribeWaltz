1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,280
At gap between the
understanding that you have,

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,290
the understanding that
the average person has,

3
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:09,291
and this could be a real problem
and trying to expand this platform.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,860
Well, we have to, to inform
you. I gotta tell you though,
when I say this to people,

5
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:16,530
they're like, that makes perfect.
So that does make perfect sense.

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:20,220
That's scary about it. When I'm not,
I'm not disagreeing with you in any way,

7
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:24,810
shape, or form. I'm, I'm just thinking,
man, for young kids or young kids and,

8
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:29,410
you know, you're a parent. I'm a parent.
But what, so our education system, um,

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,910
has a lot to be desired. And one of
the things I'm saying is like, uh,

10
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:37,080
is it's making all these kids think that
college is the end all be all and it is

11
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:41,120
not. And so that's one issue is that, uh,

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,630
we need to try and prepare kids for
different kinds of paths instead of saying

13
00:00:45,631 --> 00:00:48,870
college, College, college,
because they're going to college,

14
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,660
they're getting loaded up
with record levels of debt.

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,000
College has gone two and a
half times more expensive,

16
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:56,940
even though it has not gone two
and a half times better. Uh,

17
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,420
and the reason why it's gotten so
expensive is because they've just gotten

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,000
really bloated administratively. And what
would you do about that? Like you know,

19
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,160
Bernie Sanders wants to
have some sort of a um,

20
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,270
free college free university. Yeah.
The, he wants to do it across the board,

21
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:16,350
have education to be 100%
free something. I mean, look,

22
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:17,820
I love that on paper.
I,

23
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,780
one of the things that I hate is talking
to my friends about college debt.

24
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,200
You know, friends that are in
their thirties and forties.

25
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,820
Is this following them
around? Yeah, it just,

26
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,480
it just stays with them like a wet
blanket that you can never get out of.

27
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,030
I used to call my school loans,
my mistress,

28
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:36,210
cause I was writing a check
to like another family and
another town. I was like,

29
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:37,200
I hope they're enjoying themselves.

30
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,250
So it's like I was I think
like $900 above to buy loans.

31
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,930
And what's crazy is that if something
devastating happens to you and any other

32
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,280
form you can file for bankruptcy,

33
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,000
but you never escape your student
loans no matter what happens to you.

34
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,570
That was just some lobbying on the part
of the, the financial companies. Man,

35
00:01:54,571 --> 00:01:57,720
there's lots of other crap out of it
and it's dirty. That's really dirty.

36
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,750
When you think about how many people that
run corporations that have racked up,

37
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,360
I mean, just think about what happened
with the savings and loan crisis.

38
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:10,760
Just completely man. And
those guys skated. Woo. Yeah.

39
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,730
The vast majority have.
They're carrying around zero,

40
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,510
zero burden from that vast majority.
No one went to jail,

41
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,830
set up a few people and it really anybody,
no real criminals.

42
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:25,860
Like Bernie Madoff went to jail.
You know, a few people went to jail,

43
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,200
but that's about it.
You know,

44
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:33,090
you'd have to be a real fucking thief to
go to jail. And these people that just,

45
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,570
they did this and got away with it and,

46
00:02:35,571 --> 00:02:39,630
and profited and redistributed all this
money into their own personal accounts

47
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:41,820
and,
and stop the whole economy sideways.

48
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,610
But heaven forbid you would take out a
bunch of school loans and then things go

49
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:46,230
south. Like you can't
get out of it. I mean,

50
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:51,470
I know a guy who's in his fifties who's
an ophthalmologist who's a deeply in

51
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:56,430
debt still. So easy. Yeah it is crazy.
And if you look at it just economically,

52
00:02:56,431 --> 00:03:00,430
it's a massive burden on
people starting businesses,

53
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,700
starting families,
buying homes with their parents.

54
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,950
It's possible to fix for sure.

55
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:11,200
So the first thing you do is you go to
the people that are currently in a debt

56
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,550
and say, look, we're going to give you a
path out and there are ways to do it. Uh,

57
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,260
you know,
you can have a payment plan.

58
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:20,770
One of the things I'm proposing is like
a 10 by 10 where if you commit 10% of

59
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:22,480
your wages for 10 years
and you're debt free,

60
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,420
and that means like if you're not making
a lot of money then you can save a

61
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:30,330
whole lot. And the schools at this point
have long since forgotten about this,

62
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,320
these loans,
cause they got paid off already.

63
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,570
This is just these financial
companies that are holding the loans.

64
00:03:35,571 --> 00:03:38,320
So it's important for people to
understand because people think, well,

65
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,900
if you don't pay them in, the
colleges are going to go away. No, no.

66
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:44,110
So if you're the government, you
can be like, Hey, loan loan company.

67
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:46,300
Guess what good news went to like,
take this off.

68
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,010
It's a stimulus because like you said,

69
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,740
we've done a lot of things that
we're supposed to be a stimulus,

70
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:54,640
like give $4 trillion in the bank and
be like, that'll stimulate the economy.

71
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,570
Nothing's going to stimulate the economy
better than getting student loans off

72
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,910
the backs of freaking young people
because they'll actually do what they're

73
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:04,770
supposed to do, which is I actually
spend money, the economy, take chances,

74
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,180
take chances, and start businesses.
And the rest of it, I mean,

75
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,500
one of the reasons why our business
formation rates are at multi decade lows,

76
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,190
that we are up to one point
$5 trillion in school debt.

77
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:20,410
It's like 38 k ahead. That was like
a hundred billion in like 1999.

78
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:24,670
So we've like gone up 15 x, uh,
since then and it's crippling us.

79
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,240
It's like insane. Anyone who thinks
that that's not burdening the economy.

80
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:31,930
I mean he's got so, so president Yang
will be like, hey guys, it's a stimulus,

81
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:34,990
but this time is a stimulus that people
were going to forgive some of the

82
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:37,930
student loan debt because half that stuff
was generated. They're morally anyway.

83
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,150
A lot of it was just schools you know,

84
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,720
lying about just to
get people in the door.

85
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,080
The second thing you do is you go
to the schools and say, hey guys,

86
00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:49,270
why are you two and a half times
more expensive than you used to be?

87
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:51,040
That's kind of weird cause
like as far as I can tell,

88
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:55,950
there's been no massive quality change
and the reason is that they've hired a

89
00:04:55,951 --> 00:05:00,040
lot of administrators. It has not gone to
faculty. It has knock on the facilities.

90
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,960
It has gone to just administrative
access and bloat and then say, okay,

91
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:07,600
you can do whatever you want,
but if you want access to federal loans,

92
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:10,630
which they all rely upon for their
life's blood, like without it, they die.

93
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,990
If you want your students
have access to federal loans,

94
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:18,991
you have to bring your administrator to
student ratio in line with what it was

95
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,310
like in the 1990s and then the
schools would scream bloody murder.

96
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,710
They'd be like, I can't do that.
That's impossible. And you'd be like,

97
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:29,820
well I have a feeling you're going
to figure it out that they went,

98
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,340
they would start bringing it down and
you would realize it doesn't impact the

99
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:34,510
student experience at all.

100
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:39,310
Like I and I understand it cause I've
run a large nonprofit organization that

101
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,420
had started and you're very natural
tendency is just to hire excellent people.

102
00:05:43,421 --> 00:05:46,360
And then before you know it, you're like,
have excellent people like you know,

103
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,470
vice deans of everything.

104
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,850
But then over time that ends up building
a very large cost structure, uh,

105
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,810
that gets passed along to the public.
So you'd bring the costs down.

106
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,550
Now you'd said before,
Bernie is like free college for everyone.

107
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:02,150
The problem with that solution is
it pretended that college solves the

108
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:03,590
employment problems of young people.

109
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,710
And anyone who's coming out of
college knows that that's not real.

110
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,330
The underemployment rate for recent
college graduates today is 44% so you had

111
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:13,610
like a 50 50 shot. If you come out
of college, you're doing a job.

112
00:06:13,611 --> 00:06:18,611
It doesn't really require a degree and
94% of new jobs created right now our gig

113
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:22,700
temporary or contract or jobs that don't
have real paths forward or health care

114
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:23,640
benefits of the rest of it.

115
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,650
Yeah. I was reading something about, um,
people actually it might've been in that,

116
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,493
uh,

117
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,790
book that it was just telling you about
Yuval Noah Harari. Yeah. 21st century.

118
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:40,500
Yeah. It was, I would say that guy's
name wrong. It's a tricky name.

119
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:44,490
You evolve. Noah Herati yeah.
21 lessons for 21st century.

120
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:49,491
I think he was talking about how many
people plan on not being in the same job

121
00:06:51,421 --> 00:06:55,260
in 10 years because that job won't
exist anymore versus what it used to be.

122
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,860
It used to be that people would think
that they were going to get a job and they

123
00:06:58,861 --> 00:07:00,350
would stay with a job. Yeah, I know.

124
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,170
And now they're planning that
they're going to have to move,

125
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,610
that they're not going to be able to keep
the same job and has automation kicks

126
00:07:08,611 --> 00:07:10,700
in.
This is obviously going to bottleneck.

127
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,960
It's going to get even it's
going to give him worse. Yeah,

128
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:18,330
completely. So the ideal is that you end
up training young people to be really,

129
00:07:18,331 --> 00:07:22,200
really adaptable and have low cost
structures and just be able to, you know,

130
00:07:22,201 --> 00:07:23,130
become entrepreneurs.

131
00:07:23,131 --> 00:07:25,680
And I spent seven years trying to
train young people to do just that.

132
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,300
But one of the things I've discovered is
that we're overemphasizing college and

133
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:34,350
what were under emphasizing his technical
vocational and apprenticeship work.

134
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,470
Because a lot of that work believer now,
it's actually really hard to automate.

135
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,940
Like uh,
you know,

136
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,390
we're not going to automate
an air conditioning repair
person or plumber anytime

137
00:07:42,391 --> 00:07:44,250
soon.
And for sure craftsman,

138
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,720
people who build things and is good for
your mental health and a bunch of other

139
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:50,070
things.
So right now,

140
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:54,120
only 6% of American high school students
are in technical or vocational training

141
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,330
in Germany. That's 59%. Give
you a sense of what the,

142
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,350
the gap can be to what we're doing is
we're overprescribing college were saying

143
00:08:01,351 --> 00:08:04,230
college, College, college for everyone.
It's not really working that well.

144
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,310
And then we're still treating people who
are working in trades and everything as

145
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:10,320
somehow uh,
you know,

146
00:08:10,321 --> 00:08:13,770
like not in great careers when a lot
of those careers are actually really

147
00:08:13,771 --> 00:08:17,970
awesome and they pay great and that
people enjoy them. They're persistent.

148
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,250
So right now we're going to automate away.

149
00:08:20,251 --> 00:08:25,251
It's a lot easier to automate away a lot
of repetitive cognitive work than it is

150
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:30,930
a non repetitive manual work
because like actual robot digits,

151
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,171
you know,

152
00:08:31,171 --> 00:08:34,290
it's like if you can imagine what it
would take to have a robot plumber like

153
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,770
come into your house. I mean that
stuff's really, really tricky.

154
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,180
There's a lot of fine motor work.

155
00:08:39,181 --> 00:08:42,420
They have to like unscrew pipes and
like stuff that stuff's not going to get

156
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:45,420
automated for a long time.
You know what is going to get automated?

157
00:08:45,421 --> 00:08:49,110
A lot of like entry level cognitive
tasks because a lot of journalism tasks,

158
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,090
a lot of bookkeeping,

159
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,060
a lot of stuff that college graduates
think they're going to get a job in and

160
00:08:54,061 --> 00:08:55,560
then those jobs are going to disappear.

161
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,610
I was a corporate attorney for those
five unhappy months and my friends are

162
00:08:59,611 --> 00:09:04,080
working on uh, AI. They can automate
away a lot of basic legal work,

163
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,260
you know, so these colleges, these
college grads are like, Oh snap,

164
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:08,580
don't know what to do man.
I'll go to law school.

165
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:12,090
Didn't like load up with another
hundred 20 k in debt and then like the,

166
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:13,740
the legal jobs,
they're not going to be there for him.

167
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,430
It's often the problem of the parents
giving them pressure to go into college as

168
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,950
well because they didn't want the kid
to become a loser. And if the kid,

169
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,030
you know like where I grew up in Boston,
if you went into the trades,

170
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:27,600
if you abandoned like the
idea of higher learning,

171
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:31,170
going to college and just went right
into like learning to be a carpenter or

172
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:35,220
something like that, people look at
you like, ah, you sold yourself short.

173
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,840
But there's so many people that I
know that went to school that just got

174
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,130
university degrees and then they got
out and they were fucked. I mean it's,

175
00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:45,120
it's so common.

176
00:09:45,121 --> 00:09:49,740
It's so common that they thought that
there was going to be this path and this

177
00:09:49,741 --> 00:09:52,500
path to sit and exist. Once they
got out or it was, it was far,

178
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:55,500
far more difficult than it was then.
They were led to believe.

179
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,430
Yeah.
If you look at it,

180
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,340
about 32% of Americans graduated from
college right now and that level has been

181
00:10:00,341 --> 00:10:03,490
more or less constant for a
long time. It's not like, Hey,

182
00:10:03,491 --> 00:10:05,620
I've got another 20% I
could get into college.

183
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:09,210
Like right now the college
completion rate in six years,

184
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:14,170
about 59% so like four out of 10 people
who start college are not graduating in

185
00:10:14,171 --> 00:10:16,480
six years and a lot of them are
just not going to finish ever.

186
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:21,870
So like other the people that
have other pads available,

187
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,750
then we have to build those pads up and
this is one reason why I'm so into the

188
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:28,840
freedom dividend instead of something
like free college cause why would you

189
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:32,050
subsidize something that only the top
third of the population is going to use?

190
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,530
You know, an end. It's a highly
inefficient costly system anyway.

191
00:10:35,531 --> 00:10:36,880
Like counting money into that.

192
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,720
You're much better off putting a thousand
bucks a month into every 18 year olds

193
00:10:40,721 --> 00:10:44,140
hands. Didn't they go to college?
Great colleges partially paid for it.

194
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,690
They go to trade school,
great trade schools partially paid for.

195
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,100
They start their own business.

196
00:10:48,101 --> 00:10:50,590
They do something creative like
they want to do something to help.

197
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,000
That's great too.

198
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,420
Like you can actually start building
more varied paths and make it so that

199
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:58,860
people don't feel like I need to get
into this institution or else my life's

200
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,350
going to be over.
