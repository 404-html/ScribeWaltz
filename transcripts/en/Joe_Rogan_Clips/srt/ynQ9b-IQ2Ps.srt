1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,820
What is it about war movies
that drive you the most crazy?

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,160
The fact that almost everything in
them is an accurate, almost everything.

3
00:00:08,161 --> 00:00:12,330
Biggest thing that drives me fucking
crazy is when grenades create a fireball.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,800
Really? Well, yeah. Cause it
happens in like every movie.

5
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:20,910
They throw a grenade and a 55 gallon
drum of gasoline explodes and people go

6
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:24,150
flying backwards and cars flip over.
If you throw a grenade,

7
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:27,660
it goes pop and it puts some dust up in
the air and if you're waiting for the

8
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,820
fireball, you're going to be there
for the rest of your natural life.

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,300
It's just not going and they're
not that effective. They're fun.

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,540
Don't get me wrong, but they're not
that effective. I did not know that.

11
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:40,470
They don't like create a
fireball. No, I've never seen
a grenade go off. Obviously.

12
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,380
I'm sure Jamie can pull one up. It
just goes poof. It's dust is all it is.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,310
Seen one in a video.
I'm sure for a moment,

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,040
like the momentary explosion there
is a flash, but other than that,

15
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,520
it's literally just dust
flying up in the air. What?

16
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,890
What is the best military movie
that's the most accurate or the most,

17
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,800
the Least Offensive Navy seals starring
Charlie Sheen. Really? No, not at all.

18
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,430
Oh Jesus Christ. I'm wondering, fell down

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,270
that fucking guy.

20
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:12,480
Probably food more people in to come
into the seal teams than anybody else.

21
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,850
Oh my God. Really? Yeah.

22
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:18,930
I mean these fallen through skylights
with MP fives and handlebar mustaches.

23
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,530
You know, there's snipers calling
himself. God, I can't see anything.

24
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:26,070
I'm switching to starlight blasting
people through a concrete wall.

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,500
They're doing free fall
jumps are in submarines.

26
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,490
That's an entire 30 year career to
do all that shit and 60 minutes.

27
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,780
You take that expectation,
you come to the team just like God,

28
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,620
I'm kind of bored right now.
So was that the war areas saying Bang,

29
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:44,400
Bang, I'm going to run boys.
Yep. I want to make it.

30
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,160
And he's got the, the, the, the requisite.
A scarf around the neck and first off,

31
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:50,521
one of those.

32
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:53,940
So what kind of asshole wears a red
scarf and an environment where there's no

33
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:58,300
red. He's got green utilities on
from Vietnam. When I read, uh,

34
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,700
going to Shamal. Yeah. This
is so hilarious. So another
one, especially you would,

35
00:02:02,701 --> 00:02:03,900
you know Charlie now,

36
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:08,270
like such a fucking psychotic
partier and so apparently apparently,

37
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,400
so they came to the buds compound and did
a little bit of training with the guys

38
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:14,970
and I guess there was some bathroom
breaks and they'd just be like, all right,

39
00:02:14,971 --> 00:02:18,300
you guys ready for some more
PT? Oh really? That makes sense.

40
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,870
I've always see hearing that 18th hand,
but I want to believe it's true. Well,

41
00:02:21,871 --> 00:02:25,850
you know who I hear trains
diligently and really hard, uh,

42
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,250
and like takes it super seriously and
he's like one of the most humble guys

43
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:32,490
you'll ever meet. He's Keanu Reeves.
That doesn't surprise me. Yeah.

44
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:35,370
It doesn't surprise me either, but
I heard some people that have, uh,

45
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,140
had interacted with him when
he was training for, um,
John Wick. Yeah. Including,

46
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,530
uh, my Jujitsu instructor, John
Jacques Machado, my friend.

47
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:46,610
He can Machado's John John's
brother and a bunch of other you.

48
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,730
He worked out with a bunch
of their Machado's. In fact,
I think Carlos as well. Uh,

49
00:02:50,731 --> 00:02:53,810
but you know, he really wanted to
learn actual Jujitsu. So he ran,

50
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,930
she trained with them. Yeah. He did real
tactical courses and, and so his, uh,

51
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,390
his tactical proficiency
shows in that movie.

52
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,790
And so to get back to
stuff that bothers me,

53
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,880
it's the 72 round pistol magazine

54
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:13,010
cause I'm counting, I'm
like, Oh, 25 30, uh,

55
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,600
or the shotgun that has 48 rounds
in it so that I can't do it.

56
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,410
I'm like throwing stuff at the TV and
my wife just point, she says, get out.

57
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,170
Like

58
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,320
so Sicario I love Sicario.

59
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,400
There's a scene at the border that
has one of the most blatant, uh,

60
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,390
just errors in the movie.
There's a guy pointing a gun,

61
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,530
he's supposedly a CIA age
and he's pointing the gun
out the windshield and you

62
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:42,160
can see that the bolt to the rifle
is locked to the rear. Oh No.

63
00:03:42,161 --> 00:03:45,400
Which means the armor onset handed it
to him and you know, clear and safe.

64
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,360
And he just went and they filmed it and
nobody caught it. And I saw that movie.

65
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:52,590
I'm like, turn that shit off. I
can't watch any. Of course. Yeah.

66
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,870
It ruins it for me now.
Why don't they fix stuff like that?

67
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:59,320
You would think that you're making a
movie about military or about guns?

68
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:02,720
Like yeah,
gun nuts are going to notice that they,

69
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,230
but they probably didn't catch it
in the editing pro. It's so fast.

70
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:09,010
It's probably up there for three
seconds. But if you know, I mean I,

71
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:13,870
you look at a gun and like you just,
if it was your primary tool for years,

72
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,140
you're going to, you're
looking for certain things
all the time. Yep. Here we go.

73
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:22,720
Look for someone who doesn't know though.
It looks super serious.

74
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,230
Well that's why they're still
watching the movie and I left. Yup.

75
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,183
Bolt to the rear.

76
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,040
Ah

77
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,510
Yeah. To the rear. Yup. Go
ahead and pull the trigger
there. Go ahead son. That shit.

78
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,390
Ah, obviously an empty
magazine. Yeah. Hey silly. Yeah,

79
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,420
so nobody caught that in the editing
process is what it is. Not See that? No.

80
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:45,430
Don't you think they digitally
could've moved that forward?

81
00:04:45,431 --> 00:04:48,430
They 100% couldn't move cause he
didn't fire in that scene anyway. Yeah.

82
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:51,310
Just pushed up, pitch up,
just Photoshop that sucker.

83
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,500
I mean it makes sense in a
way less significant thing.

84
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,900
I get crazy when I watch people play pool
and movies that obviously can't play.

85
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,590
Oh, I could drive me nuts. Drives me nuts.

86
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:08,650
Like if I see someone like it's supposed
to be some pool hustler and I see,

87
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:10,780
so they have a bullshit
bridge and they're,

88
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,300
they're gripping the like you can
see things in movies like, uh,

89
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,070
my friends who smoked cigarettes say
they can tell when someone doesn't smoke.

90
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,190
Oh for sure. Yeah, because when you
smoke, there's just so like a casual,

91
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,440
real relaxed way that you're holding the
cigarette and the way you're drawing up.

92
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:29,720
But when someone's like never
smoked before and like, yeah,

93
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:33,100
they've got this weird thing to do and
like, oh that guy doesn't really smoke.

94
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:35,830
I'm like, how the fuck can you tell
it? Because I smoke. It's like,

95
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:39,910
another thing that bugs me is you watch
any tactical scene where they're like

96
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:42,430
moving down a hallway and it's like,

97
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,120
why is your gun pointed at your
buddies face? Like, that's not cool.

98
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:51,130
Why are you aiming as like, and then
the way that they make entry into rooms,

99
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:53,950
it's like, awesome. I like to play
Russian roulette with my life as well.

100
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:57,950
Like drives me. Absolutely.
What about zero dark 30?

101
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,420
That movie fucking sucks.

102
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:09,170
What sucks about it? You know what
drove me crazy that, that last time?

103
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:12,170
Do we have the redhead lady? What is
yelling at all those trained killers?

104
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,880
I was like,
I don't think they listen to her.

105
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:19,950
There are some creative liberties that
are taken in that movie from soup to

106
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:24,080
nuts. I mean, like was that person,

107
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:27,400
the lady who yelled at those guys are
the ones, the woman who was in charge of,

108
00:06:27,401 --> 00:06:30,470
was that a real human in real life?
It was based off of a real human for sure.

109
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,670
Like a lot of the things in that movie
were based on real events. However,

110
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:38,960
if you're trying to get tickets to get
people seats or their butts and seats,

111
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:43,070
you get a glamorized stuff. So a lot of
people, because in that movie, you know,

112
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:46,670
the, um, the source drives up in
the vehicle and detonates himself.

113
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:50,290
That actually happened that killed
a bunch of people in calced. Um,

114
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,210
if as long as you look at it as
entertainment, that movies. Okay.

115
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:01,280
If you look at it with a refined, I
like are they doing this correctly? No.

116
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,470
They're all going to die.
Yeah. I mean it's, uh, it just,

117
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:11,240
I, we would need another four hours to
literally go down the list of things,

118
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:14,300
but it's just things are compressed.
Things that would never happen,

119
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:18,650
happen for the sake of creating a, an,
an, an, an an intoxicating or did, uh,

120
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:23,060
uh, emotional scene on camera and it's
tough to watch cause I'm sitting there,

121
00:07:23,061 --> 00:07:24,650
I'm like, get out of the door, get
out of the door, get out the door.

122
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,760
I'm getting anxiety watching these damn
movies because you don't hang out in

123
00:07:28,761 --> 00:07:31,190
front of open doors unless
you want to get shot.

124
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,860
Now how many different things were
fucked up about that movie? Uh, Joe,

125
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,540
only the things that we're
after the opening scene.

126
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,000
That's a long movies. A disaster. Yeah.
It's just, I don't want to talk about it.

127
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,040
Dumb ass like myself. I'm like,
that's a good fucking movie scene.

128
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,370
It's pretty realistic. Well,
think about it from entertainment.

129
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,900
It's a great entertaining movie.

130
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:56,000
It asks the same question about the
movie American sniper or lone survivor.

131
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:01,060
They're all based around certain things
that have been enhanced to make it more

132
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:04,940
entertaining. Yes. And B, and I get
it. They're there to make money.

133
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:07,970
They're not there to tell historically
accurate. Do you know Marcus?

134
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,170
I do not know Marcus well, but
I do know Marcus. I know him.

135
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,000
I don't know how he felt.

136
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,840
I don't know if you'd ever say he was
a whole felt making a movie. Yeah.

137
00:08:17,841 --> 00:08:22,250
But I mean, I'm sure they only listened
to him so much, you know? Yeah.

138
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,830
Uh, given how I can, again,

139
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:28,640
having not been there and I can only
imagine how horrific that incident must be

140
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:33,290
for him to deal with on a daily level.
I would bet he wasn't very involved.

141
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,250
I would almost rather them if that was me,
I think I would almost rather say,

142
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,113
you know what,

143
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:42,410
just make the movie that you want to
make because I don't want to sit here and

144
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:47,030
explain exactly what happened and recreate
these scenes and talk about how this

145
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:51,050
person died over here. Like I would
just go, you know, go to town.

146
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,490
Is there any movie that you've
ever seen about war where you go,

147
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:58,440
that makes sense. First 10 minutes of
Saving Private Ryan is unbelievable.

148
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,870
Oh yeah.
Not for accuracy.

149
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,080
For capturing the essence of what it
feels like and the switch between utter

150
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:13,230
fear to excitement, to joy, to
anger in the matter of a second,

151
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:17,110
another movie that does a good
aspect or a good job of capturing,

152
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,040
capturing some of those aspects I
would say is also Black Hawk down,

153
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,840
not for accuracy,
but to capture the chaos that have,

154
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:29,110
how a plan can come unraveled and how
just how chaotic it can be enhanced.

155
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,690
How sometimes you can feel so helpless
but you're only solution is to drive in

156
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:36,480
to the problem instead of
moving away from it. So those,

157
00:09:36,481 --> 00:09:40,230
those capture the essence of it?
Well, from a technical perspective,

158
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,160
I honestly can not think of a
single movie that does a justice.

159
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,460
Wow. It would have to be like a 50
hour movie though because of course,

160
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,520
I mean Black Hawk down I think was a
multiple day incident in that movie's 90

161
00:09:56,551 --> 00:09:59,730
minutes. Right. So they get
rid of all the boring bs stuff.

162
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:02,940
That is actually what you do.
The vast majority of your job.

163
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,320
If I look at my career,

164
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:10,370
probably greater than 95% of my career
I spent training and then 5% is spent in

165
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:15,390
combat. Really? Yep. And
that is, that is average.

166
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,300
I would say there are people who are
maybe a little bit higher and people who

167
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:19,200
are a little bit lower,

168
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,060
but you're not going to spend more than
at most maybe 10% of your career in

169
00:10:24,061 --> 00:10:28,410
combat. Even if your job is directly
tied to combat cause you gotta train,

170
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,390
you get a plan. The missions, I mean our,

171
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,480
our normal planning cycle was 24 to 72
hours sitting in front of PowerPoint.

172
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,960
Considering whether or not I should hang
myself or blow my brains out because

173
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:43,230
we're arguing over the font that we're
using to submit permission approval.

174
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,560
Really? Oh, you're studying the,
whether you're studying the terrain.

175
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,860
I've had slides and
mission briefs sent back,

176
00:10:49,861 --> 00:10:52,520
not be approved because I
didn't orient the helicopter,

177
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,840
the correct direction on the
slide. They're like, hey,

178
00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:56,280
you need to fix this and then resubmit it.

179
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,130
Like if you want it to shut down
the average day of military,

180
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,620
it wouldn't be through a kinetic act.

181
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:05,640
You would need to put some type of code
into Microsoft office and we're done

182
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:10,230
because we operate on
Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft
Word and Microsoft office.

183
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,890
We'd sit there and we'd plan and we
would brief and we'd submit for approval.

184
00:11:13,891 --> 00:11:17,400
That's three days. Then you'd go do an
objective that would last for 10 hours.

185
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,040
Repeat, repeat the cycle on.
To add for that, it's, well,

186
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,470
you break up the tasks so each like is
it the last thing you would want is one

187
00:11:25,471 --> 00:11:26,820
person creating the entire plan.

188
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:29,770
So somebody is doing the communication
plan in the medivac plan,

189
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,950
the insertion plan,
the route planning you.

190
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,010
We don't ever really brief what we're
going to do inside of the objective,

191
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:37,710
because that's kind of the soup and
nuts that you train for at all times.

192
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:42,360
Like that's everything is to get there
and then, okay, that's actually our job,

193
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,200
but we focus on all those other
things. Then primary, secondary,

194
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:48,240
tertiary plan for each
one of those things,

195
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,890
phase lines for each one of those things.

196
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,860
None of that has ever
shown up in any movie. Uh,

197
00:11:52,861 --> 00:11:57,640
what show up in any movies
is vast majority of time
the intelligence is bad and

198
00:11:57,641 --> 00:11:59,980
you hit what's called a dry hole.
You go to a building,

199
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,860
you approached the structure, you
breached the door, and it's just,

200
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,470
the intelligence is wrong. It's
either empty or it's the wrong person.

201
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,470
That happens all the time. That
doesn't, it's not exciting though.

202
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,150
So we pay the people money,

203
00:12:10,151 --> 00:12:13,210
they fixed their door and we go back
and we try to find the person again.

204
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,320
None of that shows up in any of
the mediums because it's too,

205
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,670
they're too compressed.
