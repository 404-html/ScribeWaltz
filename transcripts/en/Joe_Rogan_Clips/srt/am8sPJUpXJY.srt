1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,870
Play and there'll be like white guy
for sure. Let's play. No gambling.

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:06,700
Just like having a fun
time. Really? Oh yeah. Yeah.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,880
I saw one in Chiang Mai in that
downtown marketplace area. Yeah,

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,370
I saw one. How Fun was that? Fucking
Thai kickboxing. Pretty Fun tie fight.

5
00:00:15,371 --> 00:00:18,660
It's so cool. And they played
the the instrument, right, dude?

6
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:20,850
How fucking fun is that?
Yeah, it's pretty wild.

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,040
I've been to those out
here where they play it,

8
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:27,660
but Americans get real bored with
the y crew. The dance. They do.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,620
Yeah. They do a dance for their, for
their own Dojo. Yeah. Well they do.

10
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:33,900
Everybody does it and there's
a real logic behind it.

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,290
The logic is that you warm up and
that you really, you relax yourself,

12
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,330
you're kind of performing in front of
all these dance moves and also people are

13
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:47,100
staring at you, so it kind of wears off
your nerves. There's a reality to that.

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:52,140
It's, it's actually really wise and you
lose, you limber up your body to like,

15
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:55,500
a lot of the stuff they're doing is
they're getting down on one knee like a

16
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:59,730
lunge and they're bouncing a little bit
and so the limb bring up their body and

17
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:02,760
then on top of that they're actually
doing this dance in front of all these

18
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:06,060
people and it calms the nerves a
little bit. Wow. Yeah. John Fix.

19
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:08,640
We're always talking about that. About
like the idea of people watching you.

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,820
It's actually a big thing and the UFC is
like a bigger people watching you then.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,470
Oh yeah. Anywhere else. It's a tougher
people watching you is fucking hot,

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,680
you know? I mean people watching him
shoot a free throw, you know? Good Dude.

23
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:23,310
Good Dude. Bunch people watch it. Oh
fuck. Here we go. Here we go. That's real.

24
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,450
Even if it's just like five of
your friends. Yeah. Yeah. Pressure.

25
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,490
The pressure's in fucking real man.
I mean,

26
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:33,150
that's what everybody's most terrified
about what we do. Public speaking,

27
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,810
I had somebody that we were given
a talk on Shakespeare or some,

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,750
it was a group project.
We each had to write one paragraph.

29
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,910
We wrote three paragraphs.
Each one of us read one,

30
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,320
so I think I read mine just
reading it off a paper.

31
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:47,910
It was paying attention in this next day
was like, and then later Shakespeare,

32
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,110
I was just looking at her
like what the fuck? And the
teacher was like, okay, okay,

33
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:58,140
okay. It's all right, let's go. Let's
[inaudible] was rude and I was like,

34
00:01:58,141 --> 00:02:02,190
what the fuck is wrong with you?
Crazy. It's weird. It was a stand up.

35
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:03,360
But like yeah,

36
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,190
the sense I used to panic when I would
talk to bank tellers. What? Yeah.

37
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:09,130
I used to go to a bank teller.

38
00:02:09,131 --> 00:02:12,330
It gets super nervous right before I'd
have to talk to a bank teller. Why?

39
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,410
I don't know. It's no reason
for it. When I was a kid I've,

40
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,880
I really felt like a loser.
I really did.

41
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:22,860
I had like serious low self esteem issues
up until like high school you up until

42
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:23,694
martial arts.

43
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,520
And then once I started doing martial
arts and getting really good at it and

44
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,970
then teaching, it kind of calmed
me down. Experience. Yeah.

45
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,970
And then it kind of like,
was it, believe it or not,

46
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:36,910
almost like a natural path to stand
up. But I remember before that, uh,

47
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,400
being very awkward, talking
to people, like very nervous,

48
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:44,700
talking to people I didn't
know and I just didn't,

49
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,870
it didn't feel like I still get that
where I'm like, I don't know how to talk.

50
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:52,470
I just trying to draw. I don't know
how to talk to. Yeah, I know, right.

51
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:56,310
Especially if it's an odd
thing. And so, you know,

52
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,920
it's was worse when they know you too,
and answer your questions. So broad.

53
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:04,570
What's Joey Diaz like? Oh boy. What's
he like? Yeah, that's, that's hard.

54
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,600
Hey Man. Of got to ask you a
question, which I do for a living.

55
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,470
Trying to get my shit together.
Okay. Fired. Fired truck operator.

56
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,950
You should make ladders. Yeah. Like,
I don't know anything about you.
