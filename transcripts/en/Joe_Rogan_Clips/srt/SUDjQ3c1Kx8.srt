1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,220
Did you see the video of the poachers
that went to kill the rhino and the lion?

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,930
The lion killer video of
it. I saw a picture. I still
still picture. Oh, okay. Yeah.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,180
I didn't know if they got a
video, but yeah, that's fucked up.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,890
That's fucking a few duets
got jacked, right. Sweet.

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:17,040
Even that's the lions and we even
look at this. Turn up the volume.

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:17,913
Jamie.

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,690
Look,
I don't want to [inaudible] Shit.

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:22,770
Okay.

9
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,200
I don't want to use my bear spray.
He said that's a good boy.

10
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,440
That's a good boy too.
He's coming around.

11
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,220
That's good. Okay. Come forward.

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,800
Yes. My things mother
motherfuckers, it's following them.

13
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:45,690
It's circling them around.
Yeah. He's cute. I mean that
thing is circling him, man.

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,050
It's going towards him. That's
a good boy. Yeah. The thing is,

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,730
the thing is coming way too close to
him, man. It's like going in a circle.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,250
Okay.

17
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,000
Crappies huge. Hell No.
Yeah, they got lucky there.

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,360
I would have been gone.

19
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,230
The scary thing about that is that bear
could have just decided randomly through

20
00:01:06,231 --> 00:01:11,090
some firing of his bare synapses to take
a left instead of right. Yes, go at him.

21
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,550
He just,

22
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,350
he could have easily decided that all
those things crazy scare the shit out of

23
00:01:15,351 --> 00:01:19,520
me. You know why man? We don't
believe in things we don't see.

24
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:20,630
We don't believe in them.

25
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,690
What do you mean you don't believe in
things you don't see? You know it's real,

26
00:01:23,691 --> 00:01:26,760
but you don't believe danger. No,
you don't believe in it. It's not.

27
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,090
It's not a real thing in your
world. Right? Right. When you,

28
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,560
if you were outside and you saw that, if
you will, with those people in Australia,

29
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:37,490
you, you Biller, oh Jesus Christ.
This is what I know. If I was there,

30
00:01:37,491 --> 00:01:41,030
I would know that that's the
reality. That's really like
my world. Does it evolve?

31
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,700
Does it involve being somewhere
near that close to a bear?

32
00:01:43,701 --> 00:01:47,450
So to see it in my world would be
what? The F W I wouldn't be real. No.

33
00:01:47,451 --> 00:01:50,600
Like holy shit, this can't be happening.
But if you were with those people,

34
00:01:50,601 --> 00:01:55,160
if you went on that trip with the odd
beat, that would be fucking fell out.

35
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,740
One of the craziest things
you get out with you,

36
00:01:56,741 --> 00:02:01,741
your whole existence gets down to the
chance that this thing makes a decision to

37
00:02:02,571 --> 00:02:05,570
go one way or another. Yeah. Otherwise
it's just going to run you down.

38
00:02:05,571 --> 00:02:08,930
Just like less like life. If you go in
a certain scenario scenarios you like,

39
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,510
wait, this shit can get real
real fast. Real fast know. Yeah.

40
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,360
That's one of them man. That his life, any
inner city life is just like holy shit.

41
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,540
It's about of a pop off
in here. Yeah. Right.

42
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,400
How many people died in Chicago last
week? Some insane number. There was a,

43
00:02:25,401 --> 00:02:27,010
the reporting on uh,

44
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:31,460
the lack of attention that the murders
in Chicago are getting and like the

45
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:35,440
national news and how crazy it is. Right.
How good. The Chicago several times.

46
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,610
The one thing that sticks
out to me every time I go,

47
00:02:37,611 --> 00:02:40,490
there's how segregated it this.
Yeah.

48
00:02:40,491 --> 00:02:43,340
I've never gone made you aware of
a major city like New York is like,

49
00:02:43,341 --> 00:02:44,660
we're all right.

50
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,720
Piled up together for killed 24
wounded and weekend shootings.

51
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,280
God, 28 people got shot. Dude,

52
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,380
that is crazy.

53
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,400
28 over the weekend in the afternoon
and say fuck standing on a sidewalk

54
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,420
wouldn't fire Jesus Christ. There is a,

55
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,620
there is a war going on in Chicago that's
way more deadly than most of the wars

56
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:18,430
were engaging in overseas.

57
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,480
You don't hear about that many soldiers
dying every day. Now that's another,

58
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,400
that's another scenario how we said like
that's real. Yeah, that's real. Right?

59
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,840
But here's real asked.
You are there outside in Chicago.

60
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:32,530
That is a real fear that you should
have and this is what's crazy number of

61
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:34,180
people in Chicago.
That's your passes.

62
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,290
1400 1400 people shot.

63
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,020
Now how many people do we
know how many got shot?

64
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,790
Like doing tours of Afghanistan?
That's a good question.

65
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,980
What does this, this is the over the
year this does this year. Sure. Yeah.

66
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:56,680
Okay, so let's Google. How many
soldiers were shot overseas this year?

67
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,750
You know the, that's a weird
thing man. We got a war going on.

68
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:05,510
If that was Mexicans invading North
Dakota and shooting people now,

69
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,160
many people were dying every day
we would be taking action. Who,

70
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:14,161
because it's happening to people is
1400 and a hundred of them were white

71
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:16,510
people. It would be an issue. Oh yeah.

72
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:21,010
It was 1300 black people in 100 white
people. It'd be, yeah, we shut it down.

73
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,050
You really, right. This is, I mean,

74
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:27,040
it's something that people don't talk
about this 300. I mean, he's like, uh,

75
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,670
be crazy.
That's a weird statistic.

76
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,790
It's a terrible situation.

77
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,290
Like culturally to have
something like this is hilarious.

78
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,180
And with 1400 people being shot,
that means,

79
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,970
and people don't want to realize this is,
you know,

80
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,310
post traumatic stress disorder is a real
thing in the ghetto as well as in the

81
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:52,210
hills of Afghanistan. It's real, of
course. So when you see something that,

82
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,450
when people were like, why these guys
have guns on them? It's like, dude,

83
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:57,880
1400 people got shot. I'm just trying
to get to school and back. Yeah.

84
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,740
I'm trying to get to work and
back. Of course it's, you know,

85
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,980
we're not protecting those people.
It's exactly,

86
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:10,090
if they were stuck somewhere overseas
in some, in the middle of some war,

87
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,390
you know, and they were American citizens
and be like, please help get us out of,

88
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,300
you've got to get these good.

89
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,400
If there was a place that
had like statistically the
numbers of the south side

90
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,440
of Chicago where all this,
the murder's going down,

91
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,980
there was a place statistically in
another part of the world, right.

92
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,300
We would be set those numbers
anywhere else. And it's a,
it's a crisis. If we had,

93
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,350
so let's say Hawaii, let's say if we
had just moved into Hawaii, right?

94
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,830
Like just just took over Hawaii and then
we're in an area where people started

95
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:40,240
getting shot at and killed by local
site that we would want to read,

96
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:43,240
want to extract those people from Hawaii.
We'd scoop them up from an island.

97
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,390
We would think they'd be shooting at the
helicopter says we restaurant. Right,

98
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,820
right. Well you just look at the
real numbers. Just the raw numbers.

99
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,870
That's a crazy number of people
getting shot this year. This is July,

100
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,600
so I just started how
many soldiers got shot?

101
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,720
I can't find trying to find wounded.
I can only find a deaths. Okay.

102
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:00,554
What's it deaths?

103
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,560
It's only like 1500 total since like
2001 since 2001 man or 26 January.

104
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,440
It seems weird saying only
I know what you're saying.

105
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,770
You just saying in comparison to the
other number since January. Yeah.

106
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:18,830
That's insane. That's
crazy. That is insane.

107
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,310
And that's happening right
here in the good old us of a,

108
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:25,730
in one of the biggest cities in the
world. Chicago's giant, awesome city.

109
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,860
And it's happening in other cities
also that people don't know about,

110
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,390
but Chicago is the most glaring. Yeah,
because I don't travel around there,

111
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:36,050
so I don't know a what
happened or why it happened,

112
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:38,480
why they have this segregation
there and what it was. All right.

113
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:42,390
Go to Chicago, man. It's like black
people all the way over there.

114
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,300
Then it's downtown where it's
nice and everybody's, you know,

115
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,630
Detroit has that too, right? It's
right as well. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Um,

116
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:55,200
man. Then you go down south. It's
like that. You go to Louisiana.

117
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:00,090
It was crazy. You were the king
or the president. Tony Rock.

118
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:04,860
I was the president.
How do you fix this? Uh,

119
00:07:04,861 --> 00:07:07,730
you have to fix this. It's
a process, man. First,

120
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:12,570
I always say number one is education,
right? Education is number one.

121
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,860
If you're just,

122
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,970
if you're getting a better education
than you just avoid the pitfalls and

123
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:21,360
naturally because you just know that
these certain things are wrong. And,

124
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:25,500
and by getting a badge at
better education, I mean you
have opportunities to do,

125
00:07:25,501 --> 00:07:29,940
you know, you have a music appreciation,
you have the arts, you have sports,

126
00:07:29,941 --> 00:07:34,290
you have things to occupy you during
school hours and after school hours.

127
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,040
There's no type of any
type of extra curricular,

128
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:41,100
extra curricular activities for these
kids. In Chicago. There's gang life,

129
00:07:41,101 --> 00:07:42,330
which you are born into,

130
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,000
which you are expected to go
into once you are a certain age.

131
00:07:45,001 --> 00:07:48,690
You all right your man. Now here's
the gun. We don't like those guys.

132
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,060
Those guys don't like us.
You don't even question it.

133
00:07:51,061 --> 00:07:53,100
It's like my father has been this way.
My grandfather has been this way.

134
00:07:53,101 --> 00:07:55,650
My uncles a display, my big brothers
to this way, you don't even,

135
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,480
you're born right into it. You don't
want it in a war zone, all right?

136
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,270
And you don't question it.

137
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,480
And it's a war zone where you
sleep and your family lives, right.

138
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,390
Not just a war zone with soldiers,
but a war zone with families.

139
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:10,060
And another thing better education you,
you're more worldly.

140
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,470
If you see the world, you
realize how small that, how
small your neighborhood is.

141
00:08:14,471 --> 00:08:17,710
And there's a bigger world out there
and you could want to go places and see

142
00:08:17,711 --> 00:08:19,660
things and then you realize
like what are we doing here?

143
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:24,040
But these are people that I guarantee
probably never left Chicago,

144
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:29,630
probably never went on vacation to the
south to visit grandparents and realize,

145
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:30,331
damn,

146
00:08:30,331 --> 00:08:34,990
the south is nice and quiet and the
people are friendly and they've never been

147
00:08:34,991 --> 00:08:39,991
to the zoo and saw animal and went home
and googled the mating rituals of this.

148
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,680
Open your mind, open your
mind, you see the world,

149
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:50,530
the stuff that you're involved in
becomes just so small. This guy,

150
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:53,080
I don't let Scott cause he has one red
and I have on blue, I don't get it.

151
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,370
So the education,
that tiny little

152
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:01,020
area, you know, that he operates
in with his living his life,

153
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,273
it does matter.

154
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,960
It's a reality. Right? The reality is
what's around you. Yeah. That's what,

155
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,170
until you get a scope of a bigger world.
Like I grew up in the hood,

156
00:09:10,171 --> 00:09:11,160
I grew up in bed Stuy,
Brooklyn,

157
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,440
but one of the wildest neighborhoods
when I was going up there,

158
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,580
but my vision was passed it. My vision
was, yeah, this is going on outside,

159
00:09:17,581 --> 00:09:21,750
but I'm going to be there one day.
What do you attribute the,

160
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,710
having the ability to do that to uh,
having a mom and a dad?

161
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,790
I pops, my father worked two full
time jobs my whole childhood.

162
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,980
My father literally
worked 80 hours a week,

163
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:36,270
80 so just to see him go everyday
and like, damn this dude,

164
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,340
this dude works hard man.
Wow.

165
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:43,170
Didn't have a lot to show for it and made
sure his kids had, mom was a teacher.

166
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:48,030
Education was, she'd been an
emphasis on it. Wow. You know,

167
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:52,590
it was, it was just like my friends, my,
my, one of my best friends down the block.

168
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,250
No Dad, my friend across the street, no
dad, my friend, two doors down, no dad.

169
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,380
Then crack came and that was everything
fucked up. Everything started.

170
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:06,130
Just the neighborhood started just to, you
know. Yeah. That was like a revelation.

171
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,170
Crack was people that

172
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,320
are alive today or young kids today,
they don't remember the eighties yeah,

173
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,900
there was a like a
plague. Yup. A plane hit.

174
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:21,050
Everybody knew somebody that got hit
and so many people's lives were gone,

175
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,460
done, done over. People who were
doing fine and then all of a sudden,

176
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,780
yeah, Yup, I remember it.
I remember it well. Yeah.

177
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:35,260
It was a weird kind of way to start
losing friends. That's what I,

178
00:10:35,261 --> 00:10:38,830
that's what happened. I started losing
friends. I, I saw it like people don't,

179
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,100
it was crazy man. Like
Shit. When the shit we saw,

180
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,210
I saw a friend get shot in the head,
like talk to him on the corner.

181
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,140
Engaged. What's up man? Yeah, we gonna
play ball lady. You wouldn't play ball.

182
00:10:50,141 --> 00:10:54,670
All right, cool. I'll hit you
later. Turned to walk down
the block. Look that maybe,

183
00:10:54,671 --> 00:10:58,870
you know, a thousand feet away and
looked back to like just, you know,

184
00:10:58,871 --> 00:11:03,180
looking around the neighborhood and saw
a guy just bang, got kinda like he was,

185
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,790
he looked like, if you ever see
an old like big daddy Kane album,

186
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,410
he had the flat top and a bunch of jewelry
on, on the corner, on the pay phone.

187
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,810
This is beeper days, you
know, and you got to turn.

188
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,740
And the guy ran up on him while he was
returning a beep and just tried to rob

189
00:11:17,741 --> 00:11:21,220
him. And then he went for his gun and
the guy just boom right in his head,

190
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,030
right on the corner of my
block, brightest, right
on the corner of my block.

191
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:29,890
And I went home and my parents are
there and I was like, this is crazy man.

192
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,750
And that's where I grew up. But my
vision was not confined to where I was.

193
00:11:34,751 --> 00:11:38,380
It was, I'm going to be, you know,
fortunately I get out of here,

194
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:40,210
I'm going to do this and once
I leave here, I'm going to,

195
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,500
you're very fortunate to have
those kinds of examples. You know,

196
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:47,940
if your dad who worked out that and your
mom, very fortunate. That's awesome.

197
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,433
Yeah,
man,

198
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,260
it's hard for some people if they didn't
get the break that you got in that

199
00:11:53,261 --> 00:11:53,990
regard.

200
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,890
That's why I don't, I,
it's not missed on me.

201
00:11:56,891 --> 00:12:01,310
Like I realized like if I didn't get
that, I didn't catch that last Chapa. Hmm.

202
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,120
Good for you, man. That's uh, but that's,

203
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:09,070
that's where character comes from to mean
having someone like that as an example.

204
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:14,360
Like how someone who can work two
full time jobs. Yeah. And that is,

205
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:17,770
that's a force of will most people
struggle with one man. One is hard,

206
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,100
eight hours a day and he makes it time.

207
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:24,880
My Dad's rule was everybody had to have
a job at 1413 was your last summer.

208
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,870
Enjoy yourself at the ball, do whatever
you wanna do. 14 you getting a job.

209
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,860
Wow. Yep. No, he didn't play at all.

210
00:12:32,861 --> 00:12:37,250
14 job since those,
he's,

211
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:41,380
the thing is, man, that's a bitter pill
to swallow when you're young, but damn,

212
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:45,490
that dude's who go through that always
seem like they have an extra gear.

213
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,451
You know?

214
00:12:46,451 --> 00:12:50,500
I know a lot of dudes who went through
like bootcamp type dads and they did not

215
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:53,350
like it,
but they can do some shit.

216
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,440
Like I'll just a little bit more shit
that other people could do. You know?

217
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:58,960
They might not look like the fact that
dad was always telling them what to do,

218
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:01,780
but these motherfuckers can hike 20
miles. Yeah. And not complaining.

219
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,060
My Dad wasn't bootcamp, but it
was like, you're going to work.

220
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,130
That's not even a question.
You're going to work.

221
00:13:06,131 --> 00:13:09,660
And then I have so many siblings
that what his rule was, you know,

222
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:13,180
we all had to take care of each other.
So my oldest brother, of course,

223
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:15,820
he turns 14 first he's working,
he gets paid.

224
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,430
You have to give everybody $5 you get,
you got paid today.

225
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:21,340
Give all your siblings five dot.
Wow. Next brother gets a job.

226
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:26,140
Now it's two brothers working. Give
everybody $5 wow. It was like a socialism.

227
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:31,150
Yeah. My Dad just made sure it all worked.
That's cool. That's very generous too.

228
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,750
That's like everybody that's forcing
everybody to be in it together. Right.

229
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,680
That's smart. And taking Mandarin. And
then it was, the rule was it was, uh,

230
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,330
if your brother's in a fight,
you're in a fight.

231
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,930
So then it became don't
fuck with the rock brothers.

232
00:13:42,931 --> 00:13:44,800
Cause there's so many of them,
you have to fight all of them.

233
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,870
So that kind of kept us safe during this
whole, you know, wow, that's awesome.

234
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,200
And what a, it's a bad
situation to be in, but, uh,

235
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,370
a great place to develop
character, right. Opportunities.

236
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:01,650
The right character there. Yeah. You
know who you are, you know what you're,

237
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:06,640
you know that you, you know, you
develop a, a sense of, uh, you know,

238
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:12,070
go and get it work hard. No
excuses, nobody's doing it for you.

239
00:14:12,071 --> 00:14:16,870
Nobody's coming to save you. You're
responsible for you. Yeah, man,

240
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,450
we all need to have a little
bit more of that in our life.

241
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:23,440
And then also a little bit more
community to, you know, and I that right.

242
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,800
And we grew up in a time where it was
next door neighbor could spank you,

243
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,570
lady across the street could grab you and
make you sit down on the stupid ticket.

244
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,680
Mother came home,
right?

245
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,650
The guy in the Bodega at the corner would
tell you to sit inside and your mother

246
00:14:35,651 --> 00:14:37,300
came home. Yeah, people would, uh,

247
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,900
they would police the neighborhood
policing we live in now. We live in,

248
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:44,170
don't talk to my kid, don't touch
my kid. Have Right. Get off my son.

249
00:14:44,171 --> 00:14:46,810
Don't touch my child. You know,
there's a lot of that. Well,

250
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:49,570
it's because somebody's man,
that's the weird balance.

251
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,010
I talked about this recently,
but my cousin, I saw my cousin

252
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,070
gets smacked by some lady once
when we were, we were both like,

253
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,810
my cousin's a year younger than me,

254
00:14:56,811 --> 00:15:00,830
so I'm might have been six and she
might've been five somewhere around there.

255
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:02,270
It wasn't any older than that.
Right.

256
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:06,530
And this lady cuffed her and
right in the face, man, she fell.

257
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:11,330
This lady fell on the ice and my cousin
just happened to be there and she was

258
00:15:11,331 --> 00:15:13,760
looking at her on the ground
and she did not laugh at her,

259
00:15:13,761 --> 00:15:15,050
but the lady said she laughed at and she,

260
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,450
the lady got up and she was just
angry that she fell and hurt herself.

261
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,910
She got up and smack my
cousin right in the face.

262
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,270
My cousin fell down and I remember
seeing it and realizing I couldn't do

263
00:15:23,271 --> 00:15:26,630
anything about it to save her, to help
her. You know, I was a little kid too,

264
00:15:26,631 --> 00:15:30,170
and being terrified that this grown up
person just smack this little kid in the

265
00:15:30,171 --> 00:15:34,970
head for something that wasn't even real.
Right. Like you don't want that either.

266
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:39,230
Right. It's like, don't touch my
kid. It's probably better. Well,

267
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:43,320
that's in the long run.
Crazy. People smile. Helping
raise a child. That's right.

268
00:15:43,321 --> 00:15:44,840
I mean, as adults, that's just a crazy,

269
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,670
she was a crazy lady that
lives in our building.
