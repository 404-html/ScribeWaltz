1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,160
Now,
before the podcast started,

2
00:00:02,161 --> 00:00:07,161
you were telling me that you wrote a
30 page paper on the Carnivore Diet.

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,870
It's not a paper. Well, it's, I
definitely spent about 30 pages.

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,330
I thought about it for a long time.
And yes,

5
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:20,100
there's 30 pages of thoughts
and references. Were you
stunned that this became,

6
00:00:20,101 --> 00:00:24,630
I mean, this is a very recent thing.
Yeah. People were just eating meat.

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,660
Well,
at first when I was,

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,310
I think Dan told me about it like
couple of years ago even like,

9
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:36,420
and I thought there's no way I was like,
I just ignored it,

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,150
but craze barely have time for
that. Right. So, yeah, I definitely,

11
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,800
um,
dismissed it when I,

12
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:47,970
when I first heard about it.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,830
But it's definitely been something
that has gained a lot of traction,

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,940
you know, sending disturb you
that it's getting traction. Well,

15
00:00:56,941 --> 00:01:00,770
I definitely have concerns.
Um, you know, I think that the,

16
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,930
the most important question really is
what is attracting someone to try such a

17
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:11,670
very restrictive diet.
You know,

18
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,700
that potentially could be dangerous
without published evidence or any sort of

19
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:18,450
long term studies and things like that.

20
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,260
So I think that the first question really
is, well, why are people doing this?

21
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:27,240
And so looking on the Internet and try to
like read about people's anecdotes. Um,

22
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:31,440
it seems as though a lot of people are
drawn to it because they have some sort

23
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:34,120
of autoimmune problem and uh,

24
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,030
so they try this diet and it
improves their autoimmune symptoms.

25
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,040
And I see that seems to be a real
common theme in you, at least if you,

26
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:47,280
if you look in the blog is
peers and stuff like that. Um,

27
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:51,830
so that's I think kind of a good place
to start where it's like, well, you know,

28
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,590
what are people doing this
for? And then, uh, so that's,

29
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:58,770
that's kind of an important
question and I'm so,

30
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,560
so further reading about this diet,

31
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,490
it sort of sort of think about,
well, okay, well what's going on?

32
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,740
It's really important when you have
like something that leads to a,

33
00:02:09,741 --> 00:02:14,020
an effect to understand the mechanism
because the mechanism is you know,

34
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,990
what's leading to this effect.

35
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:20,820
And so if you can do something that's
potentially not so dangerous or risky,

36
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:22,650
then understanding the
mechanism will help you.

37
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:25,800
Because then you can find other
ways to do it. Right. And so, um,

38
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,970
if you look at at uh, published
studies on people that eat low carb,

39
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:34,970
high protein diets, um, what's
pretty common is that there,

40
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,030
there's changes that happen in a
variety of different endocrine factors.

41
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:44,010
I'm like, you're less insulin that's
changing your satiety and hunger hormones,

42
00:02:44,011 --> 00:02:47,700
Leptin and Ghrelin and people become
more satiated and they actually eat less.

43
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:52,380
And this has been shown in multiple
studies so people actually eat less when

44
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,000
they're having a higher protein diet,

45
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,830
which makes sense too because protein
is more satiating, uh, as well. Um,

46
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,850
and also there's also been studies
on what's called food habituation.

47
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,350
Uh,
we're basically,

48
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,080
so habituation is when you're
constantly exposed to the same stimulus,

49
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:11,430
you sort of have a decreased response
to that stimulus where there's been

50
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,190
intervention trials where people are
given the same food every single day,

51
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,360
both non obese and obese people versus
people that are giving the same food once

52
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:23,220
a week. And the people that are given the
same food every single day, they just,

53
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,090
they start to eat less calories,

54
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,560
so they start to eat less naturally
started to cal work, restrict themselves.

55
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,680
Um, so I mean, and that's,

56
00:03:31,681 --> 00:03:34,480
it's kind of like a dietary
monotony because sort of thing.

57
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,540
So I think there are any,
you know,

58
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,490
if you read and the people out there
on the blogs talking about this diet,

59
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:42,950
they say, I'm like, I'm eating
less. I only eat twice a
day. I'm fasting. You know,

60
00:03:42,951 --> 00:03:44,950
so that's,
people are talking about that as well.

61
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,570
So I think there's published evidence to
kind of explain that. And also there's,

62
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:51,460
you know, people thing. Yeah, I eat less.

63
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:57,240
So that's an important point because
one thing that's really known to affect

64
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,100
autoimmunity is caloric
restriction and fasting.

65
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,850
Like it's probably one of
the most well known, um,

66
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,380
technologies that you can intervene and
have improvements in autoimmune disease.

67
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:09,740
So,
um,

68
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,670
some of that has to do with the fact
that you can sort of reset your immune

69
00:04:12,671 --> 00:04:15,430
system. There have been animal
studies and human studies,

70
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:18,610
a lot of this done by doctor
Valter Longo at USC. Uh,

71
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:22,480
he's done some prolonged
fasting, um, in animals.

72
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:25,900
And also there's been sort of like a
fasting mimicking diet done in humans,

73
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:30,130
which kind of very low calorie diet.
This sort of is meant to mimic fast.

74
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,050
Um, and those have shown that, um,

75
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,300
you basically kind of crossover because
fasting is a type of stress you cross

76
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:44,301
over into this like stronger
stress response where you're
not only like cleaning

77
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:45,880
away all the gunk and the sides of cells.

78
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:48,430
People talk about a toffee g lot
when they're talking about fasting.

79
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,900
You clean away things like damaged, you
know, pieces of DNA, protein aggregates,

80
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:56,080
things like that. Mitochondria
that are damaged get cleared out.

81
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,090
But you also sort of start to clear away
entire cells through a process called

82
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:05,530
apoptosis. And in animal studies, what's
been shown is that if you do, for example,

83
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:06,640
a 72 hour fast,

84
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:11,590
you can clear away about 30% of
the immune system and, and, and,

85
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:16,150
and re replenish it with like brand new
healthy immune cells and literally like

86
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:17,570
Oregon's shrink when,

87
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,340
during the fasting and then they'd like
re-expand because you're activating stem

88
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:22,750
cells and you're, you're, you know,

89
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,860
basically replenishing all your
damaged old cells with new ones.

90
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:32,320
We'll vaulter is shown in this
animal studies. Also autoimmune, um,

91
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,100
uh,

92
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,540
cells tend to be selectively killed off
and replaced with non on immune cells.

93
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,730
So he's also done a clinical study,

94
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,910
a pilot clinical study with people
with multiple sclerosis doing this fast

95
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:46,720
mimicking diet for one month,
sorry for one week. And um,

96
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,310
there there's symptoms improved.

97
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,970
Also a ketogenic diet was done side by
side and Ketogenic Diet also improves

98
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:56,650
symptoms of autoimmunity. So those both
were done in humans. So I think that, um,

99
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,870
you know, understanding that, you know,

100
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,630
some of these mechanisms that are at
play and not fasting itself and calorie

101
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:05,060
restriction, both have been
shown to approve autoimmunity.

102
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,630
You may be tapping into something there
by eating last. That's one possibility.

103
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,790
Um,
in addition,

104
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,210
there's been clinical studies
in humans where they were done,

105
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:19,280
they were basically fasted for 24
hours every other day for 15 days.

106
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,140
So they had like a total
of seven days of fasting.

107
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,740
And these are also people
with multiple sclerosis.

108
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,180
And there's profound changes in the
microbiome that started happening.

109
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,550
And this was an in line
with basically, um, having,

110
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:34,881
you know,

111
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:39,881
a lot of anti inflammatory cytokines
basically producing immune cells that are

112
00:06:40,491 --> 00:06:43,640
really important for preventing
autoimmunity called t regulatory cells and

113
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:47,630
things like that. So that's another
really important thing to consider is,

114
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,290
you know,

115
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,880
the microbiome because the microbiome
has been linked to autoimmunity in

116
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:56,300
multiple, multiple studies. I mean,
it's been linked to arthritis.

117
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:57,680
It's been linked to multiple sclerosis.

118
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,660
It's been linked to other
diseases like Parkinson's,

119
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:04,580
which is not really autoimmune. But,
um, and the point of this is that,

120
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:07,610
you know, again, understanding
mechanism and realizing, you know,

121
00:07:07,611 --> 00:07:12,370
there's other potential factors that could
be leading to an effect, right? It's,

122
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,850
it's actually, um, the,

123
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,540
the changes in the microbiome are really
important because there's actually been

124
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,760
a few animal studies which
have led to phase one,

125
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:23,030
phase two and phase three clinical
trials that have been done in humans.

126
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:26,030
So humans with multiple sclerosis,

127
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:28,130
we're treated with [inaudible]
cycling and antibiotic,

128
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,730
and they'd been basically the antibiotic
was shown to improve symptoms and

129
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:32,600
multiple sclerosis.

130
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,140
And because there there's good bacteria
and bad bacteria that had been linked to

131
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:39,590
autoimmunity and getting rid
of getting rid of bacteria,

132
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,650
the bad bacteria is going to
probably lead to improvement.

133
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:46,340
And that's what was shown first and the
animal studies and then in human trials.

134
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:51,740
So humans, I'm taking with
multiple sclerosis, taking
Munis cycling for two years.

135
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:55,190
So basically they had improvements
to delay the onset, um, uh,

136
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,700
progression of the disease.
Then after two years,

137
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,490
those improvements went away probably
because you're wiping out the microbiome

138
00:08:02,491 --> 00:08:04,500
and eventually you're
also getting rid of the,

139
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,760
the good bacteria and so that
things are going to catch up, right?

140
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:08,600
So you're not just,

141
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,380
you may be getting rid of some of the
pathogenic bad bacteria with antibiotics,

142
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,790
but eventually, like you're also getting
rid of good stuff. So longterm, you know,

143
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,100
you may not have those same improvements.
And that,

144
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,230
and that's a very interesting and I
think it's really important point to

145
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:24,480
understand, um, with, with
something like, you know,

146
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,500
change is very profound changes in the
microbiome when it comes to someone just

147
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:34,760
eating meat. Um, so one
thing to keep in mind with,

148
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:39,761
with the microbiome is that basically a
bacteria really are good at adapting to

149
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:44,000
their environment. That's why antibiotic
resistance is such a big deal.

150
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,610
And when you,
there's been human intervention studies,

151
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:50,420
when you take a human that goes from
a high fiber diet to a low fiber,

152
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,630
high protein or vice versa,

153
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,960
you get changes in their gut microbiome
that happened within 24 hours.

154
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,340
So within an hour you actually start to
have doubling of populations of bacteria.

155
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:05,400
And within 24 to 48 hours,
do you actually start to lose other,

156
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,290
so basically other bacteria start to die
off. And this is at the species level.

157
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,310
It's really hard to change.

158
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:14,160
The phyla of the file is more
linked to longterm dietary patterns.

159
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,260
Eventually you can change file as well,

160
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:20,370
but it's been shown that
people that go from a, um,

161
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,810
a more high fiber to a high protein diet,
they tap changed their microbiome.

162
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,280
And these changes are a lot
of the microbiome, you know,

163
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,360
bacteria that are fermenting a variety
of fermentable fibers start to leave and

164
00:09:33,931 --> 00:09:36,810
you actually start to get bacteria
cropping up that ferment amino acids.

165
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,970
So the amino acids, amino
acids, simple sugars, thoughts,

166
00:09:41,971 --> 00:09:44,040
those are mostly absorbed
in the small intestine,

167
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,850
but some of them make their way into the
large intestine. And there's a whole,

168
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:49,853
you know,

169
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,870
group of bacteria called putrifactive
bacteria and they ferment amino acids.

170
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,960
And some of these species of,

171
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:01,330
of putrifactive bacteria has
been linked to colon cancer. Uh,

172
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,190
there are much higher and colon cancer
patients. Animal studies have shown,

173
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:05,850
you know,

174
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:10,320
causal links where they can basically
regressively cause a polyp to,

175
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,150
to form a tumor.
Um,

176
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,710
and that's because these bacteria are
making things called pewter scene and

177
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:17,544
cadaveric [inaudible],

178
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:22,020
which are damaging their Gina toxic
agents that damaged the DNA inside your

179
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,180
colon cells. And so, um,

180
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,220
people that are typically eating
like a omnivore type of buyer,

181
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,480
whether eating protein and they're
also eating fermentable fiber.

182
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,230
If they're eating the fermentable fiber
that's facilitating the growth of lactic

183
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:39,040
acid producing bacteria, it, that
limits the growth of putrifactive B.

184
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:42,240
So if you're, if you're, you know,
bifidobacteria, lactobacillus,

185
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,510
s mutans as Thermophilus,
those strains of bacteria,

186
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:49,150
the lactic acid producing bacteria, which
you'd be getting if you're, I mean, you,

187
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,010
you'd be facilitating the growth of if
you're eating plants fermentable with

188
00:10:53,011 --> 00:10:53,844
fermentable fiber,

189
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,450
you're going to limit the growth of
putrifactive because they can't grow with

190
00:10:57,451 --> 00:11:01,230
lactic acid because it's not like,
you know, you have, it's not a huge,

191
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:05,310
huge concern. But the question is,
what happens when you're only eating?

192
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,430
I mean, I'll ask him, you're only
getting amino acids, you know,

193
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:10,860
so is there a long term?
So if you're, if you're,

194
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,510
if you're killing off
potentially some of this, um,

195
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,700
pathogenic bacteria and you're having
this effect where a positive effect,

196
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,510
what's going to happen long term, it's
not known. I mean, this died. I mean,

197
00:11:21,511 --> 00:11:23,990
it hasn't really been
studied at that level. I've

198
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,440
been a few people that have, have
anecdotal stories about doing it for 10,

199
00:11:28,441 --> 00:11:32,640
20 years that are online, but it's very
difficult to track. You know, I mean,

200
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,090
it's, it's that you have to
take them at their word for it.

201
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:38,400
They've eaten nothing but meat
for 20 years. They feel amazing.

202
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,880
But there's not very many of them.
There's a, yeah, there's a, well,

203
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:43,230
there may be more out there,

204
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:48,100
but it's in terms of like what
I've come across articles,
uh, you know, uh, just, uh,

205
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,150
social media profiles, people talked
about the positive benefits of it.

206
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,420
It seems to me that people that are
talking about the positive benefits are

207
00:11:55,421 --> 00:11:58,400
talking about it within a one
and two year window. That's,

208
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,840
that's what we're really dealing
with a lot of. Um, Sean Baker,

209
00:12:01,841 --> 00:12:05,830
Dr. Sean Baker who is probably the leading
proponent of it or one of the poster

210
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:09,220
boys of it along with Jordan Peterson
and his daughter Mckayla. Uh,

211
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,810
Jordan Peterson has daughter Mikayla.

212
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:15,750
They're different in that they were
dealing with severe autoimmune issues. Uh,

213
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:20,820
his daughters had two joints
replaced but before she was 18,

214
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:21,843
she had her,

215
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,260
well she had her ankle replaced before
she was 18 and I think she had her hip

216
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:29,050
replaced shortly after that.
And um,

217
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:34,590
Jordan has had some pretty
severe autoimmune issues
and depression within both,

218
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:37,420
both of them.
Those things were cleared up.

219
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:40,120
But as you've talked about
multiple times before on this show,

220
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,650
depression has been linked to
disorders in the gut biome. Right.

221
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:48,520
And this is something that you feel like
may be contributing to this as long as,

222
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:52,720
as well as both of them also got very
lean. Jordan lost a ton of weight.

223
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,870
He's back to the weight that he
was when he was 25 years old.

224
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,310
And I've eaten with him and the guy eats,
he eats a lot,

225
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:05,410
but it's a lot of meat just like he'll
eat like a 30 ounce steak, you know,

226
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:09,430
which is just crazy. It's a
crazy amount of meat. But um,

227
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,830
I don't know how many times he's
doing that a day. I don't know.

228
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:16,720
Yeah. Yeah. I think I, you know,
going back to the, the point,

229
00:13:16,721 --> 00:13:19,600
it's like there are other,

230
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,330
in understanding the mechanism is
important and there's a lot of potential

231
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,100
confounding factors,
right?

232
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,660
And that with any anecdotal data is
extremely important to consider. I mean,

233
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,720
people can't even neutrino scientists,

234
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:36,750
nutritionists and just people can't even
agree on the best diet because a lot of

235
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:42,160
these epidemiological and observational
studies, which don't establish causation,

236
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:46,090
have an enormous amount of confounding
factors. And it is freaking,

237
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:50,410
it's so hard to like control for that.
I mean, just as a perfect example,

238
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,080
we've talked about this before
on the podcast, but you know,

239
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:55,150
the vegetarian versus
people that eat meat,

240
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,420
one of the really large
studies that was done and, and,

241
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:02,170
and doctor Valter Longo was part of that
study looked in at all cause mortality

242
00:14:02,171 --> 00:14:04,720
and cancer mortality.
And it was lower in vegetarians,

243
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,030
but they decided to take
the mediators and say, okay,

244
00:14:07,031 --> 00:14:08,590
what about within this group?

245
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:13,150
The people that are healthy meat eaters
are people that are, you know, not,

246
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,270
you know, not unhealthy. So they're
not obese, they're not sedentary,

247
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:20,260
they're not smoking and
alcohol, not excessively
drinking alcohol. Those people,

248
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,540
when they took out that
those confounding factors,

249
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:27,250
the mediators had the same mortality
as the vegetarian. Yeah. Same Cancer.

250
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:31,270
So confounding factors are so important
and that with anything with anecdotal,

251
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,160
you have people that are
exercising like crazy.

252
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:37,120
Exercise has also been shown to change
microbiome, independent of diet, um,

253
00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:40,930
in a positive way where you're actually
producing more of the bacteria that are

254
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:45,370
producing things like lactic acid.
So, and fasting does the same thing.

255
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:47,470
And so you have people that
are fasting. So, you know,

256
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,010
it's not like you can't do other things
if you're on that type of bed to,

257
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,740
to sort of help with the
microbiome. But I think, again,

258
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,400
if there's a way you can do,
you know,

259
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:02,420
if there's a way that you can get these
benefits without having to do something

260
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:05,900
so hyper restrictive and we'll talk
about, I mean, I have concerns for that.

261
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:10,070
We can definitely get into that. But,
um, then you know, why not try that.

262
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:13,670
And you know, the thing with like, for
example, doing like a prolonged fast,

263
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,150
you know, once, once a quarter,
once every couple of months,

264
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:20,210
depending on how severe your
your issues are. I mean, there's,

265
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,010
there's been benefits shown with
that. Like an aging, like, you know,

266
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,420
so people that have been put
on this fasting mimicking diet,

267
00:15:26,421 --> 00:15:30,830
they have improved biomarkers of aging.
They increase their lean muscle mass.

268
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,960
I mean, so like I said, an animal studies,

269
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:37,190
and you can't directly translate the
animal studies to humans because rodents

270
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,910
have a really fast metabolism and
if you fast them for 48 hours,

271
00:15:40,911 --> 00:15:44,420
they lose 20% of their body weight. Where
humans only lose like one or 2%. I mean,

272
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:48,710
that's like clearly, you
know? Yeah. So, yeah,

273
00:15:48,711 --> 00:15:49,940
so you can't,
I mean,

274
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,880
it's obviously you can't completely
translate everything that's done in a

275
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,230
fascinating road to humans,

276
00:15:54,231 --> 00:15:59,231
but there are definitely
organs are shrinking and then
literally regrowing after

277
00:16:00,261 --> 00:16:03,860
the fast is over. Like it's like
this rejuvenation process, you know,

278
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,450
and it seems as though selectively damage
cells are killed. In fact, this whole,

279
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:12,850
like there, there's a whole, um,
doctor Valter Longo showing, um,

280
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:16,700
that cancer cells are really,
really susceptible to dying when they're,

281
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,870
when you do like a, a prolonged fast or
even a fasting mimicking diet. And he's,

282
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,440
he's,

283
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,570
he's shown this in animal studies and you
send a couple of clinical studies, uh,

284
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,730
were, were patients with cancer
were treated with standard of care,

285
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,740
but before their standard care treatment,

286
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:34,870
they were fascinated for up to
72 hours. And what happens, um,

287
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,720
what he's shown in animal studies happens
is that because the fasting is a type

288
00:16:38,721 --> 00:16:42,500
of stress, all your healthy cells increase
all these stress response pathways.

289
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,850
They make more heat shock proteins.

290
00:16:43,851 --> 00:16:47,120
They're increasing antioxidant
production pathways. Antiinflammatory,

291
00:16:47,121 --> 00:16:50,690
they're doing all this really good stuff
in response. Cancer cells can't do that.

292
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:51,860
They're like screwed up.

293
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,840
And so they can't activate
those stress response pathways.

294
00:16:54,841 --> 00:16:57,200
So it ends up killing them.
So what you end up happening,

295
00:16:57,201 --> 00:17:02,120
happening happening is that when you're
giving another genotoxic stress like

296
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,410
chemo or radiation,

297
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,770
your healthy cells become more
resistant to the damaging effects of the

298
00:17:06,771 --> 00:17:09,560
radiation and the cancer cells
become more sensitized to the death.

299
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,560
And so what he's shown in his pilot
studies in humans is that basically, um,

300
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,890
the humans that were true, that were, uh,

301
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,800
that were treated with
the standard of care,

302
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:23,480
I think it was chemo and also fasted,
they had less neutropenia,

303
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,830
which is the loss of like neutrophils,

304
00:17:24,831 --> 00:17:27,580
which is the side effect because
you're losing normal healthy cells.

305
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,270
They had less of that happening, uh,
less myelosuppression. Um, so I mean,

306
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,500
anyways,

307
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,520
the point is that I think if you can
find a way to get positive benefits,

308
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,690
you know,

309
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,890
without having to do something so risky
and potentially dangerous and unstudied

310
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:47,990
um, you know, I mean unstudied
in a really scientific way,

311
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:51,530
you know, controlling for compounding
factors. And all sorts of longterm,

312
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,460
I mean just all of that,
it's really important.

313
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,810
Well then just comprehensive breakdown
that you just did is something that's

314
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,170
really lacking from a lot of
discussion of this carnivore diet.

315
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,050
And from the proponents of it,

316
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:07,880
it's almost like a lot of them are going
into it blind folded. They'll like, look,

317
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,450
uh, it seems to be working, so I'm
just going to stick with it. But

318
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,580
again, when you're talking
about most people's cases,

319
00:18:16,581 --> 00:18:20,330
you're talking about one year, maybe
two years, sometimes even less,

320
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:24,410
where they're having these benefits.
And as you're saying,

321
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,130
it's entirely possible that they're
setting themselves up for some potential

322
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,340
longterm damage.

323
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,870
It is. Um, it is, it's
definitely possible. And
again, at the end of the day,

324
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:38,430
there's no data, there's no data. So you
can say for sure. Right, right, right.

325
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,211
There's no data,

326
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:42,960
but I have concerns and we can talk
about those concerns for sure. I like to,

327
00:18:42,961 --> 00:18:47,430
but you know, the thing is
understanding mechanism, like you said,

328
00:18:47,431 --> 00:18:50,760
going in blindly. I mean, you have
a hypothesis and it's like, okay,

329
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:54,350
your hypothesis is all plants are bad.
Yeah,

330
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,210
that's what I keep hearing and it's
like, wow, that's a hypothesis,

331
00:18:57,211 --> 00:18:59,640
but what about all the other things that
are potentially happening while you're

332
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:03,480
doing this diet and you're fasting more,
your microbiomes changing,

333
00:19:03,481 --> 00:19:06,840
like dramatically changing and
those things all have been known.

334
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,250
Multiple studies have shown in humans
and animals mechanistic detail to have

335
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:15,780
benefits on autoimmunity, on aging
in general, on brain function.

336
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:19,920
I mean all sorts of things, you know,
so it's mechanism is so important.

337
00:19:19,921 --> 00:19:23,250
You have to realize that that's
the whole basis of science.

338
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,150
Understanding how the world works around
you, understanding how your body works,

339
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,660
mechanisms like, right. You
have hypothesis and it's very,

340
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:35,310
and I understand it's like someone
experiences something positive. It's like,

341
00:19:35,311 --> 00:19:37,970
well this must be, this is it.
This is the end all be all.

342
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,870
But you have to realize
the shits complicated.

343
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,470
You got to understand the mechanism.

344
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,950
You may be doing something
long term that potentially,

345
00:19:49,951 --> 00:19:53,780
I mean it really hasn't
been studied. Yes. Yeah.

346
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,960
Well, that was one of the, I mean
I had Jordan's daughter Mikayla on,

347
00:19:57,961 --> 00:20:01,500
who's had some pretty dramatic
results from this carnivore diet,

348
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:06,420
but she's giving essentially
nutrition consulting to people,

349
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,510
but she doesn't really have a
background in it and she's in,

350
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:12,060
she doesn't have the information
that you just distributed,

351
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:16,350
like what you just said to all these
people listening and that the way you're

352
00:20:16,351 --> 00:20:17,310
describing the,

353
00:20:17,311 --> 00:20:20,700
the mechanisms and the benefits of
fasting and all these different various

354
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:23,430
things that are happening inside your
gut and all these different things that

355
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:28,260
are happening with healthy
cells and damaged cells with
fasting and that this is

356
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:30,600
mimicked by this restrictive diet.

357
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:35,070
And then this is all absent
from the dialogue. This is
all absent from the dust.

358
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,460
And this is one of the things is
disturbing the most disturbing for me.

359
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,580
It's like I get that they're seeing
positive results. I get, I don't know.

360
00:20:42,581 --> 00:20:46,740
I know I can, I deny that they're
receiving, but when they start saying,

361
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:51,940
uh, you know, plants are bad and there's
a, you know, like my friend Chris,

362
00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:53,990
he's always talking about the
war on carbs. He's having us.

363
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,760
He's also got Chris Bell,
he's got autoimmune issues as well.

364
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:02,590
He's had both of his hips replaced
before he was 35 and you know,

365
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,700
severe arthritis.

366
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:08,701
And he is leaner than he's ever been and
benefiting greatly from this carnivore

367
00:21:09,671 --> 00:21:12,370
diet. But you know, he's, he's like,

368
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,450
he talks about it like he uses
Hashtag war on carbs, you know,

369
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:20,350
and he doesn't eat salad, he won't
eat greens. Greens are bad for you.

370
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,280
And I'm like, man, I don't
not sure that's correct.

371
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:28,740
I think it's so important what
you're saying. And um, there's a, uh,

372
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,540
a researcher online that
I've been in contact with.

373
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:34,150
[inaudible] name's Kevin Bass and his,
uh,

374
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:37,300
at bass or bass B a s s not sure which,
how do you pronounce it?

375
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,600
But he also brought up this possibility
that it could be a calorie restriction

376
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,860
that these people are dealing with.

377
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:49,430
And that is essentially some of
the same mechanisms that are the,

378
00:21:49,431 --> 00:21:53,080
the positive reactions from fascinating
that you're, you're dealing with here.

379
00:21:53,081 --> 00:21:55,780
And I'm very happy that
you're saying the same thing.

380
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,300
Yeah, I think that is one very strong
possibility. And that is something,

381
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,500
you know, there's lots of
hypotheses here and you know,

382
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,670
given all the data and there's lots of
positive data about eating plants as well,

383
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,650
you know, so it's, it's really hard.

384
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,920
That's one hypothesis and that seems
to be the one everyone's sort of

385
00:22:13,921 --> 00:22:17,280
gravitating to. Hmm. Um, you know, if,

386
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:21,990
if someone is also wanting to reduce
their, their glycemic load and all that,

387
00:22:21,991 --> 00:22:25,860
I mean there's, there are other, I mean,
eating just a modified Paleo Diet. I mean,

388
00:22:25,861 --> 00:22:28,590
I eat something like a modified Paleo
Diet where it's like I'm eating,

389
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,570
I'm eating fish,
I meat meat,

390
00:22:30,571 --> 00:22:35,190
poultry and then a lot of leafy
Greens and cruciferous vegetables.

391
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,300
Now you can do something nuts, you know,
or you can do a ketogenic diet and like,

392
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,920
they're, like, I just
talked about the study, um,

393
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:45,840
that was done looking at the fasting
mimicking diet and humans with multiple

394
00:22:45,841 --> 00:22:50,830
sclerosis sclerosis. Um, there was,
uh, the same in publishing the same um,

395
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:51,683
paper.

396
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:56,690
There was a study they studied that
put patients on Ketogenic Diet for,

397
00:22:57,181 --> 00:23:01,140
I believe it was three months and it
improves symptoms of autoimmunity as well.

398
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:06,060
Was it comparable? Yeah, yeah.
Improvements. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. So,

399
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:10,070
you know, the ketogenic diet or modified
ketogenic diet is also, you know,

400
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:14,550
there's also concerns with that. Not
everyone responds very well and you know,

401
00:23:14,551 --> 00:23:16,560
the micronutrient deficiencies
have been a concern,

402
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:20,540
but you can actually eat a lot of,
um, vegetable vegetables, the green,

403
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:24,090
a good ones that are, that are low in
glycemic. So spinning my concern exactly.

404
00:23:24,091 --> 00:23:28,560
My concerns are much, much less. Yeah. Um,
and there's, it's been studied a lot more.

405
00:23:28,561 --> 00:23:28,771
I mean,

406
00:23:28,771 --> 00:23:32,520
at least there's been lifespans studies
in animals on cogenic diet where it's

407
00:23:32,521 --> 00:23:35,130
like improving, you
know, the way they age,

408
00:23:35,131 --> 00:23:38,910
it's improving their cognitive function,
brain aging, extending their lifespan. So,

409
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:43,590
you know, if people are looking
for, in addition to, you know,

410
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:47,510
wanting to help with their autoimmunity
issues, you know, there's also,

411
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:51,170
if it's like, well, I also just don't
want to have a lot of insulin response.

412
00:23:51,171 --> 00:23:54,590
I want to lower my glycaemic
levels and things like that. Um,

413
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:57,290
it seems like a much better option than,

414
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:02,060
than doing something completely unstudied.
And so,

415
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:05,660
um, you know, I think that's
a really good place to start.

416
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:08,750
And obviously not disregarding
everyone's anecdotes.

417
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:12,350
And of course she's also the placebo and
no seatbelt effect, which are very real.

418
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,210
I mean,
extremely real.

419
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,600
It's why a lot of drugs don't ever make
it to market is because they can't beat

420
00:24:17,601 --> 00:24:18,920
placebo.
You know,

421
00:24:18,921 --> 00:24:22,340
where it's like people think they're
going to get a positive response from

422
00:24:22,341 --> 00:24:25,580
something they can.
And the opposite is true.

423
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:28,900
People think they're going to get a
negative response for something they can.
