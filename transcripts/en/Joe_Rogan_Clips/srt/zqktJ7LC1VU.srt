00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:05,830
Hello Freak bitches

Yeah. Don't talk travel with
Henry Rollins. Don't you
feel like a townie? God,

3
00:00:09,281 --> 00:00:11,440
that guy's been around, hasn't it?
Do you know what he does every year?

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,520
Picks a spot on the map. Let's go like
that. Bali causes as travel agent.

5
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,000
What can we were going on in Bali and he
just flies out to Bali by himself with

6
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:23,860
a laptop and a camera pair of underwear.
Toothbrush just lives there. That's good.

7
00:00:23,861 --> 00:00:26,790
Didn't your boy are already do the same
thing because of Henry Rollins? Yeah.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,410
Are you went super deep? You wouldn't
even deeper. He went for four months.

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,460
I was like, I'll show
you. I can be wrong much.

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,940
We're looking for why you looking
for why fight and your destination.

11
00:00:39,941 --> 00:00:44,490
You're not trapped. Ari.
Shaffir fuck your Wifi.

00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,920
Fuck your phone if you really want
to travel. Yeah, really? Yeah.

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,100
Can't you've traveled with
a phone [inaudible] I travel
all the time and I like,

14
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,830
I'd rather stay home.
Once you travel to a thousand cities,

15
00:00:56,831 --> 00:01:01,030
you realize it's an illusion. Everyone's
trying to travel to where I live.

16
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,540
People are coming from Australia and I'm
going to fucking Tahiti French brother.

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,410
You know what?

18
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:10,120
You're walking through the airport and
you see the destination that the be all

19
00:01:10,121 --> 00:01:13,970
end all some dude's feet
on a fucking bad ass beach.

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,440
Like that's, that's the the goal. Yup.

21
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,890
And then when you get there either
like you realize, wait a minute,

22
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,030
that cutting off,

23
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,750
they framed off like the people trying
to sell you a fucking a crocodile

24
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,303
unloading.

25
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,430
Be like,
I've done it.

26
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,120
Dot. That's right. Dot.
I went to Thailand. I go,

27
00:01:40,121 --> 00:01:42,940
I'm going to go to dessert on a fucking
island on Thailand. And everyone said,

28
00:01:42,941 --> 00:01:45,790
yeah, you can. I go where they go,
you need to fucking take a cap.

29
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:47,440
Three hours jumped in a cab,

30
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,620
three hours I'm gone and we finally
get to go where the islands, oh,

31
00:01:50,621 --> 00:01:53,330
you want to go to the island?
Yeah. Yeah. I'm thinking, oh,

32
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,530
I don't give a fuck how much it
costs. It's just go, it's cheaper.

33
00:01:56,531 --> 00:02:00,050
If you go on a big ferry to this island
or you could take a speed bottle,

34
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,560
fucking speed boat, let's go. Boom.

35
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,600
I'm videotaping everything
they want him to speak on.

36
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:09,370
I want to go on this fucking
ion that I see at the airport.

37
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:14,230
I see him all the time. I don't give a
fuck. I'm getting book money and Shit.

38
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,740
I don't give a shit. Fuck
Thailand nonstop. I go,

39
00:02:17,741 --> 00:02:20,830
I'm going to go on a fucking
island. You get there, boom.

40
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,510
And there's 200 other people there. Yup.
And there's like snack bars and shit.

41
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,010
The secret is [inaudible] son

42
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,260
This is the Thailand.
There you go.

43
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,040
Out there was a Tracy.
That's crazy. It was a trick.

44
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,480
I spend fucking all day finding this
fucking dude that was on a speed boat

45
00:02:40,481 --> 00:02:42,670
thinking they were going to
take me to this island. Yeah.

46
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,730
Do you remember that was going to be
alone, beat you boy, Jason from England,

47
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:50,520
