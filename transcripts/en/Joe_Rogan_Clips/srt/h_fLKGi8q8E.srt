1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,040
Patch adams? No. It might be
the worst movie ever made. No,

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,980
it'd be the worst. I, it's probably
right up there with a Travolta God movie,

3
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:09,030
but I have,
oh my God,

4
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:13,170
I want to see that Travolta guy today
on the elliptical machine, fucking city.

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,320
Every second he says, fuck every
three words and you're like, oh John,

6
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:21,321
you look at you this fucking
city fucking logo look so bad.

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,640
I love that though. There is
something that I like. Ah,
I just like love the John.

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,910
There's something I like love
about a man so deeply out of touch.

9
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:37,020
I mean that's the thing is like, yeah,
look it up. Fucking thumbs fucking up.

10
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,500
Me and my wife's Jewish,
just Sarah Palin.

11
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:43,630
I love this fucking city boy.

12
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,670
The sexual chemistry between
them is palpable. Probably real.

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,360
Super Rich.

14
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,640
You were talking about at the beginning
of like like cults and I'm like,

15
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:55,290
I'm thinking about,
I'm thinking about,

16
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,500
I'm thinking about Tom
Cruise and Scientology.

17
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,090
There is a man using every ounce of what
Scientology is offering to make himself

18
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:08,040
the best available man that he's capable
of being. Then you've got Travolta.

19
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,900
You know what I mean?
Like you've got two versions of like,

20
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,670
like Amanda is becoming slightly
out of touch with what he, you know,

21
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:22,980
Eh,
look at my fucking wig bank.

22
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,340
It's a good way. How amazing our wigs
these days. He's got great lakes.

23
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,410
That's a fucking incredible wig.
Thinning just a little bit upfront.

24
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,680
You would think that's his hair. He's
living the dream. It's incredible.

25
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,820
He's living the goddamn dream.
Uh,

26
00:01:36,821 --> 00:01:40,340
you okay with time we could wrap this up
or whatever. Yeah. I'm 33 30. Yeah, we're,

27
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:45,150
what does that send the Shapiro on the
Oj thing? Oh yeah, that was, I saw him.

28
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,260
That's amazing. That little,
that Little Chin is that his,

29
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,490
he wore a little chin. He
got like a little Chin Yamaka
there. It's unbelievable.

30
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:55,710
I remember seeing him at
an award ceremony that,

31
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:59,730
and then that when he had that
Little Chin thing and I was like,

32
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:05,190
did he put that on after the thing? I
met him when his wife was on fear factor.

33
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,940
Really? Yeah. Kelly Preston was
on fear. She was on fear factor.

34
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:14,580
Celebrity fear factor. David Hasselhoff.
Kelly. Wow. Preston, how were they?

35
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,460
She was really nice.
She was super friendly,

36
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,860
but I felt like I felt
like they recruited people.

37
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,120
Yes,
they were there.

38
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:30,060
Scientology was sort of a stigmatized,
it was,

39
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:32,580
there was a lot of people that
were joining it. What is going on?

40
00:02:32,581 --> 00:02:36,230
There is a black cat.
I love it.

41
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,190
That hair is so crazy fake looking.

42
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,710
That's like that magnetic
man that you could like move.

43
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:45,690
The magnets are on the Korean hair. Like
who's fucking hair? It looks like that.

44
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:50,040
That's crazy man. That's, I mean
the color, everything is wrong. Uh,

45
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,730
that's madness. Um, but
yeah, she was super friendly.

46
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,570
She was like really down to earth.
Super Normal and friendly and she's like,

47
00:02:57,571 --> 00:02:59,310
these tranches are great.
You know,

48
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,390
if you eat enough and you want to come
and hang out later, we can eat more. True.

49
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,950
Yes. We could maximize eating. Sure.
Angela's and you can join. You can join.

50
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,890
We can let me get your phone number.
I'd like to have some eaters.

51
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,730
Yeah, I remember watching that, that go
and clear the documentary and being like,

52
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,580
Oh, I'm not scared. Like
they're not coming for me. Like,

53
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:19,840
Miscavige is not coming from me.

54
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:23,620
He's coming for like the people
under him who he sees as a threat.

55
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,570
Like I don't think he sees us as a threat.

56
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,940
Like I don't think he gives
a fuck us being like, ah,

57
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:32,260
I don't know about Scientology. He
shields himself from anything like this.

58
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,660
Any kind of criticism and,

59
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:39,160
but I do tell you that I had Miscavige
has dad on. Really? Yeah. Oh right.

60
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:43,270
Cause he's the, he's, he's, he
left. Yeah, he fucking escape.

61
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:45,910
But that's what I'm saying.
And like if I'm miss just dad,

62
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,200
I'm scared cause he's like Miscavige
just like my dad is a threat to me.

63
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,570
Like you and I talking about Scientology,

64
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:55,390
I don't think miss [inaudible] she gives
a fuck. It was a weird conversation.

65
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:58,960
What was he like?
Well he's sad is like,

66
00:03:58,961 --> 00:04:03,490
he lost his whole life to this
nonsense and his son's gone.

67
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,650
Like he can't,
his son won't contact him.

68
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,420
It was his idea to get
the family and decided,

69
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:14,140
oh so he's filled with the guilt of that.
Yeah, the sun rises through the ranks,

70
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,290
winds a running the whole fucking thing.
And that was sudden won't talk to them.

71
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:21,670
My favorite thing is Miscavige
and Tom Cruise shaking hands. Yes,

72
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,240
it's the best. It's like this.
It's this. It's this tiny,

73
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,890
yes men.
Miscavige is trumping him where you can,

74
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,220
you can see Tom cruise trying to pull
his hand away and Miscavige is like,

75
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:36,820
I will not relent, I will not release.
And you can see Tom, Chris bean,

76
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:41,821
like this tiny or man than me has an
even higher level of Alpha in this than I

77
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,550
can and I will and I will,
I will relent. Well the,

78
00:04:47,551 --> 00:04:51,540
the real threat to them as Leah Remini,
Leah Remini,

79
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,630
he's done like she is.

80
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,280
You could see him trying to
pull the fucking salute, salute,

81
00:04:57,281 --> 00:05:02,281
salute and then hand can see Tom cruise
like trying to pull his hand away and

82
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:06,340
Miss [inaudible] won't let it go.
It's really fantastic.

83
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,180
Yeah. Unrelenting. You can
see he's trying to like,

84
00:05:10,181 --> 00:05:13,570
you can see the hands trying to like
come loose any, won't let it happen.

85
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,060
He's like,
and it's like that Trump move.

86
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,830
My favorite thing is when they salute the,
the picture of Lrh.

87
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,160
They saluted a shitty science fiction
writer who was wearing that big dinner

88
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:29,350
plate around his neck and
they know and look at it.

89
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,240
Tom Cruise is not a tall man and
Miscavige is he towers over Tom Cruise.

90
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,770
Tom Cruise. Cowers over
this time. Sorry. Yes. Yeah.

91
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,700
Look at that fucking giant
gold medal. He Won. I know.

92
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,810
Being the most awesome as
person in university, but
again, I'm like, I don't know.

93
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:47,500
Did you see the resubmission
impossible. He's amazing. It's amazing.

94
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,380
He's a fucking fantastic acronym.
But I'm like, so on board.

95
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,240
I'm on board for the whole
thing. I'm like, listen man,

96
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:55,450
you know how hard it is to get a movie
made now to get anybody to pay attention.

97
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:58,910
Go learn the fucking flight helicopter.
Jump off a building and break your ankle.

98
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,620
Like fucking go for it,
man.

99
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,500
Well, you know as well as I do,
you've been around a lot of actors.

100
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,140
They're all fucking crazy.
But yeah, his crazy.

101
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:10,130
He's just a different kind of crazy,
but it's also a different kind of success.

102
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,970
Yeah.

103
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,680
But I'm like, he's a guy who I
feel like you would get like, like,

104
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:19,400
he's like, yeah, like whatever
I need to do. Like I will,

105
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,840
I will maximize myself. The gold
medal. It's fucking amazing. I love it.

106
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,830
I get some volume. Let me
hear some of this. Right.

107
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,720
I take this as a halfback,

108
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,830
some inside joke. That's like a good
insight. So I tagged you. Yeah, for sure.

109
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,330
I will continue on my way.
Okay.

110
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,420
These are the times now people,
okay.

111
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:51,640
These are the times we will all remember.
Isn't that the song? Were you there?

112
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,730
What did you do?
I think you know that I am there for you.

113
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,983
Hmm.

114
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:04,290
And I do care so very, very, very much.

115
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,820
That's why he's the best actor ever.
Yeah. Full of Shit right there.

116
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,820
Believe it or do you
think he's full of Shit?

117
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,700
I feel like he's on the
verge of fucking tears,

118
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,440
but he, he's full of Shit for
sure. With everything he does.

119
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,170
I don't think there's a moment in his
life where he's not full of shit. Right.

120
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:22,860
But he's believes it's so
deeply. Look at this. The salute.

121
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,440
Go back up, back up a little bit. I need
to see that again. Watch this dweller.

122
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,270
Right.

123
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,103
Well

124
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,570
if you know anything

125
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,800
bout that guy l Ron Hubbard
was a fucking maniac.

126
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,500
Did you read going clear or did
you just see the danger side?

127
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:45,090
Documentary book is fucking fantastic.
The book is,

128
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:50,090
he was fucking Shit House rat.
Crazy. Yeah. Crazy on a boat. Uh,

129
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,080
just he was out of his fucking mind.
Yeah. Himself. A bunch of metals, right?

130
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,180
Have you seen that? There's
a, there's a podcast called,

131
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:59,540
you must remember this and it's like
all about old Hollywood and it somehow

132
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:04,070
circumvents a little bit of like l Ron
Hubbard seen in like Pasadena with like

133
00:08:04,071 --> 00:08:05,900
all these other like,

134
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:10,370
you know spiritualists futurists are like,
and it's like,

135
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,950
it's Cuckoos Ville.
They are like, they are,

136
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:17,630
they are cruising on their own fucking
agenda and it's kind of amazing.

137
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,460
But he's, yeah, it was, I can't, I
wish I had more information, but again,

138
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:25,160
my brain doesn't retain the stuff
I need to get into Scientology.

139
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:29,740
The books help if you just maximize
your EAD trons or whatever.

140
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,360
Fucking, did you ever do a
stress test? Do you ever go

141
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,570
one time I was filming a television show
in San Diego and we had downtime when

142
00:08:37,571 --> 00:08:39,480
they were setting up a scene and uh,

143
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:42,880
we happen to be at a park where they had
one of those Scientology booths set up

144
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:47,500
and I went over there and uh, the guy
like put me through the whole thing.

145
00:08:47,501 --> 00:08:50,770
I hold onto the, the cans and
they're connected to the wires,

146
00:08:50,771 --> 00:08:53,800
but he was so unenthusiastic
he was just like,

147
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:58,380
he selling it at all. I was
like, he was bombed outside ties.

148
00:08:58,381 --> 00:09:00,180
Anytime you got something,
I don't know.

149
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:03,450
Some of your past kiss the
feet and I don't know man.

150
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:07,350
I'm thinking I had no energy fall
who was hilarious. Worst salesman.

151
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,560
I think they just make them do it,
you know,

152
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:12,900
and some people don't want to
do it and next thing you know,

153
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:16,650
they've got a fucking conference tables
set up in a park and a stack of books

154
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:20,520
and they're going nowhere in Clearwater
join. Didn't no where near Clearwater.

155
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,060
They were on the other coast.
I got to get to the fucking east coast.
