1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,740
Oh Shit. Hey, we talked about,

2
00:00:01,741 --> 00:00:05,550
remember the last time we talked about
Huawei and it hasn't gone away. No,

3
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:09,090
it hasn't gotten away. Sees someone
just got arrested yesterday. Two people,

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,520
two people. Uh, so, uh, so backstory,

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,410
fascinating. This is fascinating. This is,

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,990
this is an area I could
definitely disappear down
to Chinese espionage, right?

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,860
They go on forever. Once
again, I say, you know,

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,330
I talk about are there certain things
that the current administration is doing

9
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:30,270
that I like? One of them is the way that
they're dealing with China right now.

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,500
And yes,

11
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:34,830
the trade issue is buffeting the market
somewhat and causing some instability.

12
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:39,600
But again, previous administration, the
Bush administration clinician, lots of,

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,250
lots of prep for former presidents.

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,560
They all acknowledged that China pub
privately was not a fair trading partner.

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,650
This administration's at least trying
to call them out and calling them out on

16
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:52,800
the, on the, on the cyber
issue too, uh, on their,

17
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:57,330
on their theft of intellectual
property. So anyway, Huawei, um,

18
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,850
supposedly owned by the founder
and however many employees,

19
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,240
you know, I think Huawei
is, by the way, uh,

20
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,690
the number one telecommunications
equipment manufacturer in the world,

21
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,640
and they're the number two seller
of smartphones right there.

22
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,940
There are bigger seller of smartphones
and apple. So at Samsung, Huawei, apple,

23
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,560
uh,
for this.

24
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,060
And so supposedly the company's owned
by the founder and his daughter is the

25
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:26,790
chief operating officer, chief
financial officer, one of those.

26
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,370
She was arrested up in Canada,
um,

27
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,700
and she was arrested at the request of
the u s she's up there on bail right now,

28
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,290
waiting extradition,
hearing.

29
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,950
And the reason was because supposedly she
lied about Huawei's dealings with Iran

30
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,520
and they were busting sanctions by
dealing in providing certain types of

31
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:48,900
equipment to Iran. Now, uh, this, this,

32
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:51,000
this past week, we've had, uh,

33
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:56,250
a hallway employee who's now been
fired by hallway, uh, in Poland,

34
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,410
uh,
arrested for espionage.

35
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,780
And along with him is a member of the
Polish intelligence service, right. Who,

36
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,580
uh, retired now and was now working for
a French telecommunications company,

37
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,620
but was arrested also for
a espionage related to a,

38
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,860
uh, and related to this individual
who up until just recently,

39
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:21,090
it was working for Wallet Wowway Claims
Innocence and says, well, we have no idea.

40
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,000
And the founder just came out and
gave this big speech and said,

41
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,300
I would never let the Chinese
authorities tell me what to do.

42
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:30,870
And I would certainly never spy on
anybody using quallies capabilities and

43
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:33,660
technology.
And people are probably thinking,

44
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:37,830
what the fuck are you talking
about this for? A Huawei and beds,

45
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:42,750
their telecommunications equipment
throughout the world. Right. So it's in,

46
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,770
uh, uh, our allies, uh,
military operations,

47
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,080
which then are connected to ours,
right.

48
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:52,980
In terms of communications and transfer
of intelligence and information. Um,

49
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,130
they're everywhere and
it's a chose Poland.

50
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,740
They've been in Poland for about 10 years.
Poland is a very important NATO ally.

51
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,280
So I, I'm, I'm taking a long
time, I realized to explain this,

52
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,320
but what I'm trying to say is nothing
happens by happenstance, right?

53
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,680
The Chinese don't operate that way.
So the Chinese authorities sometime ago,

54
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,660
years ago, looked at it and went, yeah,
this makes sense, right? We've got Huawei,

55
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:19,080
which by the way, the founder
of a former military, uh,

56
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,590
people's Liberation Army
engineer, um, he, uh,

57
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,190
they, they, they looked at this
and they thought Poland, uh,

58
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:29,530
that would be a good beach hit for us,
right?

59
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:32,980
Because there are a key element of NATO,
so let's go to Poland.

60
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:36,330
So they started a burrowing into
Poland striking deals and you know,

61
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,340
they're basically the most important
foreign relationship now a corporation

62
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,760
inside a Poland and they're fully
embedded and they've had access to, uh,

63
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,090
at this point to NATO communications.

64
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:53,650
And now the arrest of these two
individuals. And people will still,

65
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,680
despite this and despite their
past, despite their, their,

66
00:03:56,681 --> 00:04:01,060
their theft of information from
everybody from us steel to, uh, to Alcoa,

67
00:04:01,061 --> 00:04:03,700
to Lockheed Martin to dupont,

68
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,670
all the times that they've been stealing
information, people will still go wide.

69
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,500
You know, I don't, I don't believe it.
I don't, that doesn't make any sense.

70
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,000
I don't see why the
Chinese would act that way.

71
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:15,040
And I don't see why we're being
so harsh on them. You know,

72
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:19,240
this tariff thing is a bad idea. My
point being, you got to call them out.

73
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,950
They're not going to necessarily
change their behavior,

74
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,010
but you got to raise
public awareness, make, uh,

75
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:26,350
our allies understanding where
that's what we're doing right now.

76
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,370
We're saying you've gotta you got to put
the brakes on this, build a firewall,

77
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,900
use other companies, telecommunications
equipment, right? Because you know,

78
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:36,760
the fact that we're
tied in with our allies,

79
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:41,440
with Poland and with Canada and
know that gives them access to us.

80
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,000
So for someone on the outside,
look, myself was trying
to look at this, and you,

81
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:48,910
you say that Walway's stealing stuff
like stealing stuff from us steel.

82
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:54,000
How are they doing that? Well, they, I
mean the u s steel, admittedly that was a,

83
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,080
that was a pla,
that was the People's Liberation Army,

84
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,640
a third department operation
against dupont and,

85
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,660
and also against us steel and others.
So that was a little bit different. I,

86
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,520
I conflated the two,
but Huawei,

87
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,500
one of the things that they do
is by having access, uh, and,

88
00:05:07,501 --> 00:05:11,710
and embedding their equipment
in your communications, um,

89
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:16,360
infrastructure that gives them
the ability then to, uh, in,

90
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,860
in a simple way to tap in. Right? And it's
a package intercept information, right?

91
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,570
Basically.
So you have communications,

92
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:27,250
imagine we're trading information
through NATO, uh, channels, right?

93
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,820
All they need is that one in, right?
That's it. It's like everything else,

94
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:32,590
it's like fishing, right? It's
just like, you know, when,

95
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:35,260
when hackers just an individual hacker
sitting in somebody's basement, you know,

96
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:38,720
he just needs that one avenue.
He needs to get one. It's just,

97
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,340
just click on that email that
gives me the pathway in. So when,

98
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:47,341
when Huawei is able to embed their
technology into Polish communications,

99
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,240
and we're now connected
because of our NATO alliance,

100
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,770
that gives them access to us, to
France, whomever, and yeah. You know,

101
00:05:57,771 --> 00:05:59,540
it's,
it's not as if it just happened.

102
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,450
It's not as if Huawei from a
business perspective, so, you know,

103
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:05,210
I bet we could sell some of our equipment
in Poland. Wouldn't that be good?

104
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,440
The guy who was arrested,

105
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:11,441
the Huawei person who was arrested
was responsible for the provision of

106
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:16,010
telecommunication equipment to
government facilities. That was his job.

107
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,830
And the guy,
the Polish guy,

108
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:23,710
one of his last jobs with the Intel
service was, uh, communications.

109
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,413
Uh,

110
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,840
so I guess what I'm saying is none of this
shit happens in a bubble and it's all,

111
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:31,010
it's all very well mapped out.

112
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:36,011
The Chinese have a very
long view on things and they
are very good at developing

113
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:41,360
operations like this and so they've
been very successful. Um, so we'll,

114
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:42,710
we'll, we'll see. But it's, it's,

115
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:45,860
I'm glad that the current administration
at least is calling them out.

116
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,050
I don't believe it's necessarily going
to change their behavior and that,

117
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:48,531
you know,
and we'll,

118
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:51,860
we'll probably get some sort of deal
where they'll claim to look just a couple

119
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:51,861
of years ago,

120
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:56,861
they agree with President Obama to stop
their cyber shenanigans and they didn't.

121
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:01,760
So they just changed the way that
they did it. Um, you know, that's,

122
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:05,210
that's the world we live in, but I think
it is important to make a stand, right?

123
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:05,621
Yeah.

124
00:07:05,621 --> 00:07:10,420
There's some that the tech people are
saying that they think it's preposterous.

125
00:07:10,421 --> 00:07:12,820
When they were talking about
the ban on android phones,

126
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,340
some of the tech people say
that doesn't make any sense,

127
00:07:15,341 --> 00:07:20,020
but what you're saying is it goes
far beyond the actual phones itself.

128
00:07:20,021 --> 00:07:24,460
And it's really the,
the mission of the actual company itself.

129
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:29,190
Yeah. I'm saying that there is no way
that Huawei and, and other important

130
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,490
Chinese companies are
solely privately owned and,

131
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,060
or have,
uh,

132
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,740
the ability to tell the
Chinese authorities that
they will not spy on their

133
00:07:40,741 --> 00:07:43,950
behalf. It just not happening. It's
just not happening. You have to,

134
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:49,220
you have to go a long ways to come up
with that sort of naive viewpoint that

135
00:07:51,241 --> 00:07:56,241
says that a Chinese company is going to
put its foot down until President Gee,

136
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,900
absolutely not.

137
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:02,880
We will not do anything to harm another
nation's country or a company or shit

138
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:07,070
they've spent, they've spent
generations now decades, uh,

139
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,610
jumpstarting their industry and moving
up the food chain on the global economy

140
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,880
by hoovering up everything
possible out there. So if someone,

141
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,140
a tech wizard got ahold
of one of their routers,

142
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:23,590
can have they been able to
detect something in there
that doesn't belong or some

143
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:26,540
sort of a back door or some sort
of a way that they could tap in.

144
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,680
It's like if you were,
you know,

145
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,560
you were apple and you were sending
data to Raytheon or whatever and you're

146
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:34,400
going back and forth,

147
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,600
they could tap in through that as it had
been proven that there's a device like

148
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,340
that.
Yeah.

149
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,190
A former NSA director Mcconnell back in,
uh,

150
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,020
2015, I think early 2015, um,

151
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,700
came out and NSA came out with an official
statement and it said every major US

152
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,300
corporation of any has been, um, uh,

153
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:02,190
attacked and exploited by Chinese.
And we have never,

154
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:06,390
ever not found Chinese malware
within their systems. Wow.

155
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,790
That was over four years going out for
malware being software. Right, right,

156
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:16,560
right. Is there anything in the
hardware itself? Uh, yes. In, in,

157
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:20,790
in a sense that, um, yes,

158
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:25,460
in, in the sense of like,
I'm trying to remember the,

159
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,590
the name of it, but not
doing a very good job. Um,

160
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,380
if you have,
uh,

161
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,390
access to or understanding
of physical hardware,

162
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:42,030
um, then you can, uh, affect
easier, you can affect,

163
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,620
um, physical control of systems.
Right. So, uh, stuxnet, remember,

164
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:49,510
I don't know if you remember stuxnet
was a dude, but it was exactly,

165
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:54,120
it was an attack on Iran. Um,
the shut down their nuclear
program. Right, exactly.

166
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:58,730
To, uh, essentially what it did was it
took over control of some centrifuges, uh,

167
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,490
over spun them that he did about broke.
And it was a virus and it was,

168
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:07,440
it was an piece of software
that was able to impact the,

169
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,440
the, you know, physical equipment. Uh,

170
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:15,450
it took control of those
systems because in part, uh,

171
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,830
whoever perpetrated it had much better
understanding of that gear. Right.

172
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,210
Or had access to that gear. And that's
a, that's an important part of, of this.

173
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:26,850
And it's happened several times
since then. And I'm, you know,

174
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:29,370
I'm not disclosing anything because
it's all it's been written about.

175
00:10:29,371 --> 00:10:33,330
I'm sure it will be a movie at
some point, but, um, that is, uh,

176
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:38,580
that's a concern. I'm far more worried
about a company like Huawei with,

177
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:42,900
it's a integration into allied,
um,

178
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,460
our allies,
uh,

179
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:49,500
telecommunications systems than I am about
sort of the individual sale of phones.

180
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:51,690
And you know what that
means? Look, you know,

181
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,430
Amazon and all the others are gathering
more data on the average American than,

182
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,323
you know,
uh,

183
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:00,000
US government or anybody else's
government is doing it at this point.
