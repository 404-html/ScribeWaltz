1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,290
The joe rogan experience or who knows,
they might be pro Trump.

2
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:07,740
Trump just sold off the loss of
national parks grand staircase,

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,730
open it up for oil and gas drilling.
They probably liked that shit, man. Yeah.

4
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:13,290
That's an interesting thing.

5
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:18,291
Like I've heard very different versions
of that from z Zinky when that guys,

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,780
what does he, secretary of the
interior. What does Zinky yeah,

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,200
when he was talking about it,

8
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:25,920
he's explained to us not what happened
and that essentially went right back to

9
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:29,150
where the way it was
before Obama changed the,

10
00:00:29,151 --> 00:00:32,190
the legislation changed the rules.
I don't understand.

11
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:36,090
It was protected under Obama for a
good reason. There's dinosaur fossils,

12
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:38,280
they're native Americans
have monuments there,

13
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:40,080
but of course we don't care
about native American monuments.

14
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,180
We just care about confederate monuments.

15
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,810
We don't care about abolishing all the
native American land and all the treaties.

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,890
We just care about protecting bizarre
confederate statues around the country.

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,210
I don't think we should
protect confederate statues
and in the sense that I

18
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:59,130
don't think they should be in like the
middle of fucking times help squares and

19
00:00:59,131 --> 00:00:59,964
shit like that.

20
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,940
But they should do something with them
the same way they should do something

21
00:01:02,941 --> 00:01:05,320
with Gingiss con statues,
Thrombus Museum.

22
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,150
Do you know that most of those
things were made during the um,

23
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,710
the Jim Crow era? That's a
relational Swain constructed.
That's an amazing point.

24
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:16,560
A lot of people think that it was right
after the civil war and in fact it was

25
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:20,100
like in the 60s it was during
the civil rights movement.

26
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,890
There was a protest to the civil rights
move. A little Donald doing here. Yeah.

27
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,440
Well here, here's a statue and they're
shitty statues to a lot of them.

28
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:34,360
Like really poorly constructed
there. Made him quickly. Yeah,

29
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,430
it was a protest to the civil rights
movement. A lot of them. That's crazy.

30
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,270
But the thing is like they are
a representation of history.

31
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,350
Just like a Gig is con statute would be
a representation of that monster. I mean,

32
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:50,170
we think of Gingiss ECON is
a guy who opened up trade
with China today. You know,

33
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:55,180
you vaguely understand that he was
responsible for the death of 10% of the

34
00:01:55,441 --> 00:01:56,970
population of the world back then.

35
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,200
Change The fucking New York Times had an
article about how he changed the carbon

36
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:03,270
footprint of the earth.
They,

37
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:07,950
there's literally a difference in the
carbon footprint because 10% less people

38
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:12,180
were alive during Gingiss Khan's
reign because they killed everybody.

39
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,160
They fucking quit killing
millions of people.

40
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,580
There's a great Dan Carlin series
on it called the wrath of the cons,

41
00:02:17,581 --> 00:02:20,520
but I've talked about it way too much.
But today,

42
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,270
youngest comes not offensive like you
could bring up getting those comp.

43
00:02:23,271 --> 00:02:23,830
Nobody cares.

44
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,970
Me waiting more horrific than anything
that happened during the civil war.

45
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:30,270
They had slaves and they,
they did everything they used.

46
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,570
They would capture people and use them
as the front line and they'd push them

47
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:35,730
towards their own people.
So they would get shot.

48
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,950
They will be the first people
to get shot with arrows.

49
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,900
And I mean there's some horrific shit,
but I think,

50
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,260
I think we should melt
kingus Khan statues.

51
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,490
I think the confederacy is just
so much more recent and yeah.

52
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,720
Was mines do something with it though?

53
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,450
I mean I don't think it should
be in town square for sure.

54
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,800
In anybody's Townsquared.
Yeah,

55
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,560
but I think they should do something
with them instead of melting them are

56
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:56,281
smashing them.

57
00:02:56,281 --> 00:03:00,700
They should put them somewhere at least
for the future lease for future people

58
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:01,900
to like look back.
Like look,

59
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,000
this is how fucking wacky people were in
the 1960s they construct these Omadjela

60
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:09,250
has to the 18 hundreds
and slavery was legal.

61
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,400
They constructed these statues to sort
of paint these people in this heroic

62
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:20,140
fashion that we're fighting
to keep black people slaves.

63
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:21,690
That's part of the thing.
There was,

64
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,610
this is all right there as part
of the history of this country.

65
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,850
We've got to put it somewhere. I mean,
I'm not saying it should be worshiped.

66
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,180
Definitely shouldn't be
prominently featured. So yeah,

67
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,770
there should be something like
that. Right, right. Yeah. And,

68
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:40,410
but it should be like detailed description
of when it was constructed and why

69
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,550
was he instructs exactly who made it,

70
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:45,760
what was the political affiliation of the
people that created it? Totally. Yeah,

71
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,540
totally. It stopped this
whitewash and bullshit like that.

72
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,190
Every time MLK day comes around,
I'm always just like,

73
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:56,090
did you know MLK was like a rabid
anti militarist and anti imperialist?

74
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,130
No, because they, he was the most hated
black man in America. Someone said,

75
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,080
do you know that he used to
fuck all these white women,

76
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:04,820
like who does only fucking white women?
It gives us a lot of fun.

77
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,180
He did this person.
We had a good time.

78
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,730
That's going to be the bad thing. Oh,
well you just turned it around for me.

79
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,550
I'm okay that I have a dream speech.

80
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,870
It's so strange.
But people how they turn on things.

81
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:31,980
Yeah.
