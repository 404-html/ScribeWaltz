1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,660
The joe rogan experience.
Of course.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,400
I feel like there's more people that
are leaning right today than ever before

3
00:00:08,401 --> 00:00:12,640
and I attribute it entirely to the
people on the left piano to thing.

4
00:00:12,641 --> 00:00:16,290
That's funny about it is
that most human beings,

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,090
even if you'd just look at
the United States, right,

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,780
most people are not the
extreme right or extreme left.

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,090
No overwhelming majority are not right.

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,410
I think a lot of the staff is also a
little bit media created in the sense that

9
00:00:28,411 --> 00:00:28,771
he's like,

10
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:33,690
let's find the moss bat shit crazy person
on that side wants put the spotlight

11
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:38,430
on them, which make everybody go like,
what the fuck? Who are those crazy people?

12
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,880
And that's how,
it's kind of like if you were to peek,

13
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,110
you know the Westboro Baptist Baptist
Church and make it be representative of

14
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:50,700
Christianity. It's not, you're nobody.
If you keeps putting the spotlight there,

15
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:54,150
you'll create this perception with create
a backlash and it becomes this thing

16
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:59,151
where like that's one of the funny thing
that I was noticing because I really

17
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:03,270
don't like political correctness. I really
don't like academia. I really don't.

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,090
You know, there are 10,000 of these
things where I'm like, yeah, that's,

19
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,840
I'm completely on board with
not liking some of these things.

20
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,180
But then there's another side where,
you know,

21
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,270
I have been teaching a university since
2001 I don't think I've seen once a case

22
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:23,020
of the kind of political correctness that
I see in articles in media. No. Once,

23
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,930
you know,
like I was doing the math,

24
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:29,100
I had probably maybe 11,000 students
in my classes over the course of these

25
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,360
years and I don't,

26
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,540
I haven't heard one person ever defend
the hardcore communism or make an

27
00:01:35,611 --> 00:01:39,960
argument. Even among my colleagues,
which I have issues for other reason.

28
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,520
That's never been one of the things.
So I'm like, I keep hearing about it,

29
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:48,390
I read it on papers, but why is
it that when I spend, you know,

30
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,420
that's how I make my living.
I'm on college campuses all the time.

31
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,500
I hardly ever see it. And so I'm thinking,
I'm not saying that it's not true.

32
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:58,800
Of course. I mean, of course the
stories are true. There's no argument.

33
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,030
But what I'm wondering is how much do
they get blown out of proportion because

34
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:05,880
you get clicks because it makes
for an interesting narrative,

35
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:10,080
which then some people also leave
off kind of narrative. And I'm like,

36
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,600
how much is it something where you're
putting the spotlight on a rare exception

37
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:18,060
and make it the norm versus how much?

38
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:21,360
It's a real thing because you know,
you would expect,

39
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:24,050
I mean I teaching south and California
and some of the most elite, you know,

40
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,550
Santa Monica as one of the
most liberal places around.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,670
If the seeing was as
dominant as advertised,

42
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,260
I should be running into it all the
time. Right. And I don't like that stuff.

43
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,330
So I would be sensitive,
you know,

44
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,970
I would be paying attention and yet
I don't see it. So I'm like, hmm,

45
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,370
what's going on here?
That's interesting. Well,

46
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:44,850
I think the instances are more
frequent than ever before.

47
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:48,870
But I also think if you put it into
perspective and think about how many

48
00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:51,000
universities there are across the country,

49
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:56,330
I mean there are hundreds and hundreds
of universities and if you have one

50
00:02:57,871 --> 00:03:02,871
incident that breaks one
month in one place exactly.

51
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,030
And it was about one conservative speaker
that's going to give a lecture and

52
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:08,620
everybody freaks out and goes crazy.

53
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:12,490
And all the people with green
hair fucking bang on the windows.

54
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,050
It's a, it becomes something that
people were worried about spreading.

55
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,570
And so I think that's one of the,
one of the reasons, cause like,

56
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,260
I'm sure you're familiar with the
story from Evergreen University,

57
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,830
Evergreen state. Yeah. That
was a fascinating story.

58
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,480
And for people who are
interested in it, Google, uh,

59
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,480
Bret Weinstein and um,
evergreen state college.

60
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,940
And you could listen to him on my podcast.

61
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:39,580
I had him on right after it all went down.

62
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,610
What had happened was there's a thing
called the day of absence that had

63
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:46,660
traditionally been people of color would
stay home just so that people would

64
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:48,910
recognize that like, oh,
when they're not there,

65
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,070
we missed them and we
missed their contributions.

66
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:52,630
And they're an important
part of our community.

67
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,090
I think that's a little silly
to stay home to do that.

68
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:00,540
But I think it's not a bad thing for
people to recognize that everybody plays a

69
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:05,350
part. And if these people
feel marginalized, give
him a little extra juice,

70
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,213
that's fine.

71
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:10,030
But the real hardcore social justice
warriors decided that's not enough.

72
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,570
Instead what we want is all
white people to stay home.

73
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,890
And like you can't do that.
And of course, cause the,

74
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:20,910
now you're telling people to stay home
versus allowing people to stay home in

75
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:23,620
which a case you missed them.
This is the opposite.

76
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,110
You're telling these white
people to fuck off. So Brett,

77
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:30,460
who is like a fiercely progressive person,
was telling people like,

78
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:32,710
you are making a mistake here.
You're getting out of line.

79
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:33,970
This is not the way to do it.

80
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,690
And then they went crazy
and they're fucking looking
for him with baseball bats.

81
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:41,740
And they, you know, they, they,
they literally kidnap classes.

82
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,240
They held a teacher,

83
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:48,040
they held the principal or the
president of the school in this room.

84
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,350
And even when he,
they went to the bathroom,

85
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:53,140
they escorted him to the restroom and
then brought him back to the room and they

86
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:57,130
wouldn't let people leave. The stories
are amazing. No, I mean if had that stuff,

87
00:04:57,131 --> 00:05:01,510
he's complete batshit crazy line. Right.
That shit crazy. Completely agree on that.

88
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:04,810
It's like that is ridiculous.
That has no place anywhere.

89
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,100
That's bullshit that you don't do. Stuff
like that is just same thing as like,

90
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:12,330
you know the Jordan Peterson
thing in Toronto, that policy,

91
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,880
we'll just do a pick policy and he
was right in are going against you,

92
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:18,310
so I'm not arguing that those are the
dio role. No, I know you're not. No,

93
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,140
you're not the right.

94
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:24,140
My issue is from there at wire we're going
to dcs and the super prevalent thing,

95
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,990
it's like from one story or
one study there to say instead,

96
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:32,080
you know there's a communist conspiracy
to brainwash as well. It's like, okay,

97
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:36,430
what we are starting from a completely
understandable parameters and taking it

98
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:40,180
like 25 steps too far.
Yeah, I agree. I agree.

99
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:45,510
But I think that what's happening is
more of these unusual situations are

100
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:49,960
occurring and so people were terrified
of this spreading like wildfire across

101
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:54,630
the country because kids are
very easily influenced, you know,

102
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,220
and there are also idealistic, you
know, they, they wanna change the world.

103
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,850
Maybe they grew up with a father was an
asshole and a racist and like fuck this,

104
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,440
no racism,
no fascism.

105
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:06,230
And they're calling everybody a
Nazi and running down the street.

106
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,280
[inaudible] has a question,
not as a something I'm sure off,

107
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,370
but what I want that is
our match of daisies,

108
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,540
media media fueled them
and would match is real.

109
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:22,360
I mean [inaudible] he yelled for sure.
My question is how much is some, well,

110
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:27,430
there's most certainly media influences
people in it influences people in a

111
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:30,020
bunch of different ways.

112
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:32,570
It shows that you can get
attention for doing certain things.

113
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,480
It shows that other people were in
support of maybe what you thought,

114
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,990
what your radical idea and that you
find other radical people as well.

115
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,740
But I mean that's also the argument
for not publishing the name of school

116
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:43,970
shooters.
Right?

117
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:47,870
It's because a lot of these people think
that this is media fueled by people

118
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:48,920
that are seeking attention.

119
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,580
I think they're probably right and
certainly in a certain respect,

120
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:58,150
but it's also just a part of who we are
and I think it makes us really consider

121
00:07:00,131 --> 00:07:01,430
and taking the responsibility.

122
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:06,700
What is significant about broadcasting
ideas and how much influence these ideas

123
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:12,500
have on people who absorb them.
For sure. Take them in for sure.

124
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:17,080
I think my issue, it's some of the things
that often it becomes a partisan thing.

125
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:21,380
It become my gun. When your guys do that,
then they showed us totalitarian sinks,

126
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:24,490
then boom,
bat totalitarians where my guys to wait,

127
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:29,060
I'll turn the other way and pretend
it's not true to me in fact is not a one

128
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:30,740
particular ideology or another.

129
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:33,680
It kind of goes back to what you were
saying about human nature in general,

130
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,080
totalitarianism.
You know,

131
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:39,380
this idea that you want to control
what people think they are.

132
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,690
Choices is horrible,

133
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,450
but regardless of who was
doing it and in that case,

134
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:48,410
nobody has a monopoly on this because
you have seen a hardcore religious

135
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:51,340
fundamentalists push totalitarianism.
You have seen her,

136
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:55,100
you know [inaudible] ideology like
communism pushing totalitarian. Yeah,

137
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,520
completely right.
You'll see people on the political left,

138
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:02,170
volleyball on the political right.
Everybody has the, it's a vitals,

139
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,650
you know it's a fire of self.
The mind that when it takeover,

140
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:09,730
there's this desire to squash rollout are
choices and I find it equally horrible

141
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:11,960
that regardless of who doing it,

142
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:16,990
you know I'm a little suspicious when
the night Ruthie becomes Luca dose guys

143
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:19,370
doing it and you're only picking one side.

144
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,990
Like there are some guys where
I see even the desk better too.

145
00:08:22,991 --> 00:08:25,670
They try to be like, no, I'm
fair. Look, I pick up my,

146
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,590
I was listening to
somebody doing this thing.

147
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,170
I think it was more rightwing Gloria
and [inaudible]. He was saying,

148
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,690
Oh this time we are wrong. And
I was like, oh look at that.

149
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,210
That's kind of a set of cottages.
That's interesting. Let me listen.

150
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:39,650
We are wrong because we are just like the
left and you should hear what the left

151
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:42,400
at the and then for the next half hour
he goes on about the left and be like

152
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,910
[inaudible]. He sees a motherfucker
[inaudible] parties on shale.

153
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,360
That's like not being honest to me is and
that I think what bugs me is when it's

154
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:57,180
an ideological battle, when you want to
score points as opposed to saying, look,

155
00:08:57,181 --> 00:09:01,380
there are certain scenes that are
fucked up that are evil totalitarianism

156
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:05,070
regardless of we charge a TV's
attached. Wheaties bad. Yeah.

157
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,710
How about we agree on that.
You know that's,

158
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,740
that's kind of where some,

159
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,390
sometime I feel Alito sketching the
way the narrative gets pushed that it

160
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:17,760
becomes a,
my tribal versus your thrive is saying,

161
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,580
well you would probably know better than
most because you've been teaching in

162
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:24,060
universities for so long. I mean you
would see that you're on the battlefield.

163
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,440
I think a lot of what it is is a lot of
what you were talking about before about

164
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:33,441
people doing horrific things is that
they're cowards and they just give in to

165
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:37,110
the whims of those around
them and the mob mentality.

166
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:41,820
And I think that happens with the right
wing ideology that you see expressed in

167
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,830
horrific ways. Like, you know,
whether it's uh, you know, I mean,

168
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,810
fill in the blank.
It could be Charlottesville.

169
00:09:48,811 --> 00:09:53,040
Should it be any of these horrific things
that have happened where right wing

170
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:57,210
people got together and protested
versus what happens with the left.

171
00:09:57,211 --> 00:10:00,840
I think it's a lot of it is just
people wanting to be a part of a group.

172
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,770
People wanting to be a part of this,
uh, this thing that gives them,

173
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:10,130
they have this feeling of being
in a tribe and solidarity and,

174
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,160
and they go along with whatever the
ideology is that tribes pushing opposite.

175
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,880
And that means such a danger because he's,
you know,

176
00:10:17,881 --> 00:10:21,690
that sense of belonging is something
that all human beings crave to one degree

177
00:10:21,691 --> 00:10:23,400
or another.
And sweets.

178
00:10:23,401 --> 00:10:26,940
The same thing that make people join
cults is the same theme that would make

179
00:10:26,941 --> 00:10:31,230
people join some hardcore
political position is the
same thing that make people

180
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:34,650
join bike guy. It's the same
mentality, right? Is we need to,

181
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,430
as our tribe,
our group with the same clothes,

182
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:42,590
with the same idea as we stand for
because he feels good to have other people

183
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,140
embrace. He was one of them,
or three t well as a result,

184
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,320
but of course the price to
pay is your individuality.

185
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,153
Okay.

186
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,840
[inaudible].
