1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,590
To boom. George Lockhart.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,450
John Cavenaugh. How I folks. Hello
Sir. Good to see you. Good to be here.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,570
Um,
so Saturday night,

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,230
what are your thoughts now that we're
sitting here? It's Monday morning. The,

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,340
the could be McGregor fight went down
Saturday night and obviously hugely

6
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:27,540
disappointed. I didn't get the results
from the night. I still enjoyed it.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,440
I tell it was a great fight.

8
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:31,650
I'm looking forward to watching the back
of many times. All the corners fights.

9
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:35,640
I always pull a over the lessons away
that I can pass on to the next generation

10
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:37,200
of guys.
But yeah,

11
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:41,130
overall I really enjoyed the fight and
I'm devastated that we didn't get there.

12
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,510
Yeah. How much time did he have
to prepare for this fight? Um,

13
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,230
I mean he's always in the gym. He's
always, he's always knocking about,

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,690
but I guess it was official over 10 weeks,
10 weeks out.

15
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:54,960
But even since the 85 I kind of knew,

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,090
or at least I taught his next MMA fight,
would be happy with,

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,490
just just kind of made sense if
it wasn't going to be the Diaz,

18
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:05,580
but then as time went on that
that seemed less and less likely.

19
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:09,060
And Habib obviously he was doing
great, you know, kept on winning.

20
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:12,300
So there was a path that
was going to collide.

21
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,890
Was there anything that was
surprising in the fight? Um,

22
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,420
the, the, the right hand and
the second round was, yeah,

23
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,750
it was a cracker was beautiful.
Overhung right. I mean it's a,

24
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,120
it's a staple of wrestlers,
overhand right. And clothes,

25
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:27,660
but he doesn't generally do
it's more job and then close.

26
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:32,661
But that was a great chart and this style
of takedowns everything was planned of

27
00:01:34,231 --> 00:01:38,610
what we expected. And we spent a lot
of time in preparing for that. Um,

28
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,760
yeah, just I, I, you know,

29
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,860
kind of expected round warm for sure.
Going to get a take down.

30
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:51,420
So the goal of round wound was to get
out of it. It's still having energy.

31
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,330
We do month to put a huge amount of effort
into trying to get back open rear one

32
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,220
we've seen that happen many times in his
or her opponents and to kind of go back

33
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:03,300
to the stool, you know, really tired
so [inaudible] make him pay, you know,

34
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,390
do our best on the way in fight as hard
as we can. But if you do end up down it,

35
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,320
which it was against the fence,
figured it would be there,

36
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:14,660
tried to stay seated up. If we end up in
our back, just tried to play guard until,

37
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,060
until it, until the Bell, except
it will be a ten nine round

38
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,410
for round two. Again, same,

39
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:26,640
same plan and do as much damage as we can.
But if we end up on our back,

40
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,000
I don't put a huge amount of
effort and trying to get up.

41
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:31,320
He's an absolute master,

42
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,060
a regrounding people and that turned
out to be a ten eight round. You know,

43
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:39,300
he got some good shots there and obviously
he landed the greater right hand.

44
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,010
So that was a bit more than we hoped for
around treating things started kind of

45
00:02:44,011 --> 00:02:48,120
turning a little bit in our favor and
we did a lot better at keeping it in the

46
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:52,190
middle, defending the takedowns until
the plan was to slow him down a little.

47
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,110
I would watch him slow down a little bit
in the third, fourth and fifth. Yeah,

48
00:02:55,111 --> 00:02:55,781
exactly.
Yeah.

49
00:02:55,781 --> 00:03:00,781
So I think I at the beginning that the
consensus was Conan x amount in the first

50
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,500
or her be, you know, takes over
from to on like first the wind,

51
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:09,510
the third round was probably a bit of
a surprise to people but and you know,

52
00:03:09,511 --> 00:03:10,271
he knowed eloquent,

53
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:13,150
acquaint the fight if you look at that
for Montreal and he wasn't able to hit

54
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:17,410
any take downs. Um, so
hoped that's what we have.

55
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:18,370
We'll go around tree,

56
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,290
we could defend the takedowns a lot
easier and start landing air shots and,

57
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,280
and that did happen for round tree,

58
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,340
not as well as I as we
plan as well as we hoped.

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,300
And then a around for, you know,
we hit another great takedown,

60
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,870
made it mistake given up the over hook,
exposed our back.

61
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,210
And that was all she wrote.
Yeah.

62
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:42,070
He has such a unique ability to tie
both legs up with his legs. Yeah.

63
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,030
So I'm calling around one,
I thought college as well.
We would practice for that,

64
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:49,290
for, to keep her legs bent.
You know, you see guys,

65
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,240
he straightened her legs and then from,
and Connor did do that a couple of times,

66
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:54,790
but he was able to
continue to get a leg free.

67
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:58,690
So not until the last 30
seconds or so around one.

68
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,000
He didn't really tie
them up and get him flat,

69
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,470
flatten his back for the majority of
that, he was against the fence, you know,

70
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:09,700
use his hands to keep upright,
tried to learn a little shots. Um,

71
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:10,840
yeah.
