1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,530
If they can do that and get people
really upset if they really can't do it.

2
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:07,250
That's a really effective strategy.
It's a great strategy.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,500
Can make things happen now cause it's
just sewing internal discord and we're

4
00:00:10,501 --> 00:00:11,760
going to collapse her own system.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,420
Like I wonder how many of these Jesse
Small a is that? I see his name.

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,690
Jesse smell, A's rushing.
The whole thing is Russian.

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,360
It's not even real thing is Russian chess.
It's Molly doesn't exist.

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,530
I wonder how many of the memes were
created by Russians to try to get people

9
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:27,090
upset.
I bet this bunch.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,930
I bet there's more people stirring things
up then just Temaze Americans that are

11
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:32,880
upset. No, I'm sure it's people that are,

12
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,810
but then there's also just a lot of
Americans that hate each other. Does that?

13
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,740
Yeah. Yeah. There's that.
But then you also, what do
you think happens with Jesse?

14
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:44,340
Small light his empire because
ABC got rid of Roseanne for tweet.

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,400
You got to get rid of this guy.
I thought he was getting canceled.

16
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,750
He was getting written out rather
than I read today. But yeah, I dunno.

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,930
I thought he was getting written out
before and this is one of the reasons why

18
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:57,960
he did it. Well, I support him if that's
the case, cause he's a very hard business.

19
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,570
This is a very tough business.
It is hard. It's hard to make it.

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,090
I love that they had to plan that out
and he said to the two guys, he goes,

21
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:10,830
listen, get a noose. Yeah, cool.
Get rope and doing those. All.

22
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:13,700
A lot of these hate crimes, if, first
of all, I hate crimes happening.

23
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,840
They're horrible.
But some of these things are fic.

24
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:20,220
Do you know he showed up at the hotel
with the new still around his neck holding

25
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:23,010
a subway sandwich.
Just that alone,

26
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,270
the people and people at the hotel should
have been like, what? What happened?

27
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,960
That's amazing. Okay,
what happened? Why juice?

28
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,670
It's still at the sandwich and why are
you eating at subway or you're not sick

29
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:37,230
to your stomach.
You're on empire.

30
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,410
What the Hell's wrong with you in
the wrong subway? Subway's not good.

31
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,800
It's not bad if you're hungry. Listen,
I've, I've clearly hating it. Yeah,

32
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,920
but it ain't great. But if it's
like two o'clock in the morning,

33
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,880
it's the only thing open. Why
is he telling me to, yeah,

34
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,600
that's a great point is it's open.
Okay.

35
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,060
A good move to be open when nothing
else is open. It's a good point.

36
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,130
You get a nice Italian.
So I would double meat.

37
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,500
I like the [inaudible] oil and vinegar,
salt, pepper ball with the Mozzarella,

38
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,580
whatever.
And then you don't toast it.

39
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:06,300
You let the hot and meatballs melt the
cheese. Ooh, I agree with that. Yeah,

40
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,160
that's a good move. Meatball
sub. It's always a good one.

41
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:11,820
It's always a good morning.
Especially after faking a hate crime.

42
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,790
After you fake the hate crime. Amit,
both. How nervous you after you do that?

43
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,540
I'm such a pussy. I could never
go. I could never do what.

44
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,360
He did some level associates, but
then I saw that act right. You know,

45
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:27,060
with the other night, and I went,
oh, he could do that. Yeah. Oh,

46
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:29,910
these people can do it because
they're on another level. Well,

47
00:02:29,911 --> 00:02:33,960
the other thing is that people say,
who would want to be a victim?

48
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:37,110
Who'd want to fake being a victim?
I heard that during the cabin off hearing.

49
00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:40,290
I was like,
that is a ridiculous thing to say.

50
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,850
Cause there's a lot of currency
in our business, in our business.

51
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:47,730
It takes a lot of conflict,
tea in the world,

52
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,720
like people like praise victims for
showing out and they support them.

53
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:54,840
You get a tremendous amount of love,
especially if you're a legit victim.

54
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,140
Something of course, you know, I
mean there's a lot to that. Yeah.

55
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,390
The idea that no one would do
that is so there's so against,

56
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:05,080
it's so contrary to human nature. No,
everyone would do it. I want to do it.

57
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,620
What would you do? What kind of hate
crime would you faked? It was great idea.

58
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:12,440
I don't know if I got punched and
people saw my face, they'd go good.

59
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:18,700
It deserved it. You know what I mean? Like
nobody would look at my face ago. Yeah.

60
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:22,660
Okay, good. Well, I wrote, I tweeted
something today. I was like, Hey,

61
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:27,610
I'm at flappers on uh, what was it?
Uh, my, the 26 of flappers I was,

62
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:30,160
it was two guys was Hollywood
would Maga hats. They beat me up.

63
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:31,570
They put something on me.
I don't know what it was.

64
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:36,370
I think it was come please
come to farmers. But I mean,
that's the thing. Listen,

65
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,450
I watched good morning America
interview this morning. I left,

66
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,530
I sent it to my buddy. I go, there's
a moment in it. When they go,

67
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,080
how'd you know it was the attackers?
And he goes like this. He goes,

68
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,620
and you could see the insanity. You
can see in his eyes. He goes like this.

69
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:55,120
He goes, I was there and he's
just doing that Shitty actory.

70
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,210
Oh,
like just fucking shitty acting class.

71
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:04,360
That horse shit. I was there and
I'm like, this is fucking crazy. Oh,

72
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:08,800
he was going to inform on two guys if
there were two white guys with Maga hats

73
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,390
who got caught.
Oh my God,

74
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,120
I'd be in jail right now because
the detective said to them,

75
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:17,080
we have two suspects on camera. Do
you think it's Sam? He was like, yeah.

76
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,450
Then he found out it's just two
buddies and he's like, well,

77
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:20,710
I can't testify against them.

78
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,550
He was going to testify against two
people who they thought were guilty.

79
00:04:24,551 --> 00:04:27,580
So he said that he thought it
was dumb. Yeah. He said, yeah,

80
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,970
there's a good morning America
interview. Oh, have him going? Yeah.

81
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:34,420
It's those two that takes it to another
level and then Fox, he's like, well,

82
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:38,440
we stat with, hey, he's good on
the show. We stand behind them.

83
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,680
That takes it to a completely different
way than it would be people in jail

84
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,710
right now. He wouldn't care.
Could you imagine? It's crazy.

85
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,330
Could you imagine not just faking a hate
crime, but then putting people in jail?

86
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:53,050
Magic being those two guys were just
sitting in jail like, what the fuck?

87
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,620
You're on the cover of the New York
Post. Nab dumb got them, got them,

88
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,390
and they're sitting there like,
what the fuck?

89
00:04:58,391 --> 00:05:00,370
And everybody wants to
kick their ass empire.

90
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:02,440
Next season is all about Jesse smaller.

91
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,510
They fire everyone else on the show and
it's just a Jesse smallest story and two

92
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:11,560
innocent people. The Gay Tupac
wandering the streets of empire.

93
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,800
That's why people in Ohio,
whenever Hollywood like,
here's how to vote. They go,

94
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:19,030
you know what? No. They go, you know what?
No thank you. I see what you're doing.

95
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,890
You fucks faking hate crimes.

96
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,900
What kind of hate crime would you
fake if you're going to do it?

97
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,810
It's a great question. It's
a great question. What if,

98
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:28,210
what if someone gave you a
license to fake a hate crime?

99
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,390
Like what if there was a television
show about faking a hate crime?

100
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,390
That's how they do at punk. You
know, you are fake things like that.

101
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:36,760
How about you fake a hate crime?
I'd love to do something like that.

102
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:41,380
True TV presents. Yes. Fake a hate crime.
Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting. I don't,

103
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,630
I'm trying to think.
Press conference a whole deal.

104
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,500
Maybe a Halaal guy would
attack them in New York City.

105
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:49,750
Like a Halau guy would attack me.
Um,

106
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,280
because he views me as a
symbol of imperialism and
oppression. There'll be good,

107
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,070
you know, even though I
patronize his stand all the time,

108
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:01,100
still feels the need to attack. I mean,
I don't know. I could never do that. No.

109
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,890
I'm one of those people who would get,
and I would get caught,

110
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,290
well this would never
think I'd get away with it.

111
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,410
Wanting everyone to think you're a
victim when nothing really happened is

112
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,770
insanely selfish thing. Yeah, that's
an insane like faking physical crime.

113
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,380
Ikea to have someone punch him already
hit himself. Yeah. These marketers,

114
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:22,190
phase Maggot hat wearing gangs that
everyone's talking about in Chicago and La

115
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:26,000
and New York do not exist. If you have
a mega hat on at 2:00 AM in New York,

116
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:28,140
you're getting bleached poured on you.
Yeah,

117
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:31,640
probably reality will also like just,

118
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,650
he was saying that he like punched him
back and he fought back and I love how he

119
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:39,800
was like, first of all he was on camera
for everything except one minute.

120
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,920
So they ask him to good morning America.
They go, how long was this? He's like,

121
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,550
it felt like several minutes,
but it could have been 30 seconds.

122
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:50,510
Like he's covering the span of
time in his, in his lie he's going,

123
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,930
I got to say it's less than a minute
cause I'm only off camera for a minute.

124
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,550
Whenever you hear about a guy like
kills his wife and blames a black guy,

125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,340
you know there's been a bunch of
those, right? It's been a ton of,

126
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,510
and then you see the Energy Simpson,
for example. Did he blame somebody?

127
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:08,450
Blame know somebody probably blamed
him, you think? Nah, I'm kidding.
