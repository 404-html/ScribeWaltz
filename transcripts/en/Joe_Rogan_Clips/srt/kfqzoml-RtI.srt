1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,650
Her low freak bitches and before that,
you know,

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,090
you just go back a few more
people and they were grunting.
Yeah. I mean they, they,

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:14,040
they hadn't even figured out how to write
things down. They, you know, or even,

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:14,540
you know,
what's,

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,810
what's even crazier to think about is
how we've taken airplanes and perfected

6
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:22,590
that. And the last 50 years, you know,
before that it was, you know, you didn't,

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,130
you couldn't just get on an airplane and
be anywhere in the world in 24 hours.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,730
Oh yeah.
It's a total units.

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,860
Parents 1903 you want to hear the
craziest fucking statistics. Emer okay.

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,370
Between the time that plane was invented,
the,

11
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:38,940
between the invention of the airplane and
someone dropping an atomic bomb out of

12
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:43,020
the airplane, it was less than
50 years. Yeah. That's crazy.

13
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:44,050
What we do to each other.
I know

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,840
it was like somewhere like 44
years or something like that.

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,600
Between the invention of the
airplane by the Wright brothers,

16
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:55,620
the first flight and then a bomb
dropping on Hiroshima. Yeah.

17
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,490
And then now there's fast and
furious eight and they got bombs

18
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,870
segues plug there. It was good.
Well you should go publicist,

19
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,890
just totally unrelated. Just thought of
that. How many of those have you done? No,

20
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:15,770
this is the first one that I've
done. This is the first one. Yeah,

21
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,010
this is the eighth. This
will be the eighth one. And
they're going to do 10 right?

22
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:21,250
So they're doing a back to back
because I went there, done. I didn't,

23
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,940
that's the plan. Uh, you know
I'm not, I'm not a, you know,

24
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:28,430
I'm sure van and vin diesel and
the producers have, you know, the,

25
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,100
the plan set. But I mean
that's the whispers. I hear
that we do a couple more. Um,

26
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,270
I think 10 would be cool. He made it this
far. Might as well go to 10 right now.

27
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,720
Can you tell us, does your character
survive? Can you give us a spoiler alert?

28
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,343
I saw the movie,

29
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,230
you can tell us that you're not obvious
if you didn't have to sign anything.

30
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,490
It was, it was good last night. I
mean Scott had a big role. I was,

31
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,620
it was cool cause I didn't know, you know,
you never know. Like didn't, didn't ask,

32
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:58,890
didn't anything. But yeah, he's all over
it the whole time. So it was cool. He did.

33
00:01:58,891 --> 00:01:59,351
He got a job.

34
00:01:59,351 --> 00:02:02,960
Let's just say it's a good one then
everyone will like it or you also car God.

35
00:02:02,961 --> 00:02:07,920
Do you like muscle cross? I'm a
classic car guy. Um, I like classics.

36
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:09,690
I love the old sixties.

37
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,640
A Ferrari between a Ferrari and
for that whole rivalry back then.

38
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:18,360
So the GTS exactly. Yeah,
exactly. I'm actually getting, uh,

39
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,320
getting the opportunity to purchase
uh, one of the new GTS, uh,

40
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,510
coming out in 2017. Really do
that thing looks insane. Insane.

41
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:32,150
And they're making only a hundred
this year. Punch our cunts a hundred.

42
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,840
I was so excited about it.
Why would you make 107 billion people?

43
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:41,400
You didn't make a hundred cars,
asshole collectibles. So I mean,

44
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:44,430
how much they charge for those for 100
bucks. Rough for a hundred of them are,

45
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:48,600
I mean, I think the price
is about three, three 50,

46
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:52,430
$350,000. It's a collective.
Sure. This fucking thing. It's,

47
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,420
it's a beast. Look at that thing.
Know it's the new one. Sanity.

48
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,040
Yeah.
Configurator can can fit.

49
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,470
Why are they letting you configure
it if you can't even fucking buy it?

50
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,540
Just a bunch of teases forward. What
are you doing that, first of all,

51
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,760
that doesn't even look like a Ford.
I mean that looks,

52
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:12,100
that looks like a Ford on planet Mars.

53
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,950
It's pretty much changing the code
that lets you know, like a Ferrari.

54
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:18,430
Jamie's can crap. It looks better than
a Ferrari. I think. You know, that's,

55
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,990
that's bad ass car.
Let me see the,

56
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:25,630
see if she got some other angles on it.
Is there any other angles? Look at that.

57
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,790
Pretty like the hood. Oh
my gosh. Oh. Cammo on that

58
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,250
Ridge reaper option. Look
at that. Fucking God.

59
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:41,230
Oh my God. What a beast. I think
I might get one to actually, wow.

60
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,000
Go for it, dude. Go for it. Of just
my ram, my whole life of salary,

61
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:51,040
but that's
$350,000 but meanwhile,

62
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,440
the way they're making cars today,
that thing's got to be insane there.

63
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,290
But that'll be like a piece of art
that that will be, you know, like the,

64
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,550
the GTE knowing the older gts that have
gone up in value because they just don't,

65
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,480
it's hard to say that. What about new
cars though? So much plastic and stuff.

66
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,510
They just don't seem to, people
don't want them, you know,

67
00:04:11,511 --> 00:04:16,310
like if you get up 1960s car,
it's worth a shit load of money today.

68
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:20,180
But in the 1990s client worth shit.
You know what I mean?

69
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,420
It's like there's no classics from 1990
it was a couple of porches, like nine,

70
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,460
nine six fours from the nineties or
nine nine three is the last of the air

71
00:04:28,461 --> 00:04:31,190
cooled cars. They're still worth
some money there. They're classics.

72
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,300
But that's kind of it. Like maybe a
few classic Ferrari's from that day,

73
00:04:35,301 --> 00:04:39,140
but like a Camaro from 1990 yeah.
Push that thing off a cliff

74
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,350
and shoot at it while
it's on its way down. Hey,

75
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,330
don't let your girl drive that car. Oh,
she got issues. We were saying before,

76
00:04:47,331 --> 00:04:49,000
she ain't,
she crashes things a little bit.

77
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,770
History of a long history. Let's
leave it at that. Hey listen,

78
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,530
people can't be great at everything.
You know. That's true. Yeah.

79
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,520
Good. Yeah. So now they just
pointed to the side. And
what about like fight scenes?

80
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:09,980
Do you have to do fight
scenes? Like especially you
have martial arts background,

81
00:05:09,981 --> 00:05:13,570
should have you do scenes.
Yeah, I didn't do the,

82
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,890
there wasn't a terrible amount of, uh, a
fight slammed, slammed against the wall.

83
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,080
I could see I get slapped around a little
bit in this one, but a sure, you know,

84
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:26,440
in, in other films, I love doing that
stuff. That's the fun stuff. Especially,

85
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:28,810
you know, cause cause you get to
hang with those, the, you know,

86
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,860
some of the coolest guys on sets, all
the, all the stunt guys, you know,

87
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,700
they're all, you know,
likeminded people, all, you know,
martial art background guys.

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,360
Um, and so you're just choreographing
all day working that out.

89
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:42,760
And then you get on set and you're
doing it or you're, you're, you're,

90
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,580
you're doing it with them because
they might be planning the, you know,

91
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,730
villa number seven or something,
you know, something. So then you're,

92
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:51,430
you've already sort of got a
shorthand with them and your that's,

93
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,050
that's the fun stuff.
That's cool.

94
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,450
It's way better than dealing with
like a difficult actor or something.

95
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:00,330
Do you ever do that? Yeah.
Who's the worst? Oh, come on.

96
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,570
Make it make their name or something
else. Doesn't make their name. Ryan,

97
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,020
let's, you know, uh, you'll,

98
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,840
you'll get me in trouble like
guys. Oh, that's right. Oh yeah.

99
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:18,680
That's why here I thought
it was torpedoes, but nope.

100
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:23,150
Might just be lips and loose
lips yet in the scene, uh,

101
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:28,620
the rock picks him up, like in slams and
holds them against the wall and the dam.

102
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,490
My royal was that real.
It's real.

103
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,150
It's real with some assistance.
There's some movie magic,
but he's, he's a big guy.

104
00:06:38,151 --> 00:06:42,150
I mean, it's real. You would have dropped
him and choked him out. Dot. Dude.

105
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:47,120
So jacked. He took a photo of him after
workout the other day and I'm like, yeah,

106
00:06:47,121 --> 00:06:50,560
he's huge.
So discipline to 4:00 AM like,

107
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,530
man does he is when you're on set with
him, was he just always doing that?

108
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:57,860
Like what's his deal? He's just
extremely disciplined guy. Um, you know,

109
00:06:57,861 --> 00:06:59,960
I got a lot of respect
for him. He's uh, he's,

110
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:04,130
he knows what he wants and he is going
to get it. Like he's not there is no, no,

111
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:08,270
he is taking it down.
He's making movie after movie after movie.

112
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:12,020
He's going to go do it. He's uh,
you know, he eats religiously.

113
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,230
He's got these meals are
towns, you know, which is,

114
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,230
I love doing a meal prep
stuff cause it's great.

115
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,160
Makes his life one less thing
to think about. Right. Um,

116
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,060
but he's very religious with it.

117
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,330
Look at that piece of meat. He's more
jack now than he's ever been in his life.

118
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:34,030
I think he's 44, 44 46 or something. Yeah.

119
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:38,840
And just crazy reject. Yeah.
Continuing to get more and more.

120
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:43,040
Jack still still putting in the work.
He's not done getting jacked. He's,

121
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,790
he's keeping pumping it. He's
keeping it going. It's just a,

122
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,430
when you see his schedule and his
workload and then there's always some new

123
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:53,380
projects is doing all this doing
a TV show and he's doing it. No,

124
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,800
fuck does he have time?

125
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:58,040
And he's hosting this award show and
he's like doing something for the troops

126
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:01,220
and then he's doing this movie and
finishing up that movie. He's like,

127
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:04,700
how I tell you the travel is what
kills me. I know you probably,

128
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:08,870
you've been in show business
for all longer than all of
us, you know. Um, and uh,

129
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,830
the travel is what kills you, right? He's
not the fate of the furious April 14th.

130
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:17,570
That's when it comes out this Friday or
vin diesel and the rocket odds in this

131
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:20,150
photo, I can't tell. It seems
like there was, hey, that piece,

132
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,690
that patients that I read or was
that real? Yeah. And it's all,

133
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,440
it's all just don't believe it.
Don't put anything on the Internet.

134
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:33,430
Some real issues to two alphas collided
on the set and Mindy's wouldn't take off

135
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:37,100
the sunglasses even at night.
It was so strange.

136
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,540
Fucking dope cars though, man,
dude. So he took off his necklace.

137
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:46,280
I pay attention to that. What kind of
cars they have in this episode. Oh,

138
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,610
that's not a charger with
the flared fenders. Yeah.

139
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,600
You got like sort of
supercharge their charge.

140
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,970
I that sucker was on display somewhere,
right?

141
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,420
That charger isn't on display somewhere.
It might've been. I mean it's,

142
00:08:58,421 --> 00:09:03,070
it's one of the hero cars in the
phone. Fucking insane car. Oh my God.

143
00:09:03,071 --> 00:09:06,060
That's pretty sexy, right? Yeah. Those,

144
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,560
those American cars from the late
sixties early seventies so you just,

145
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,610
you just can't get anything like
that sexy. Yeah. God amazing. Yeah.

146
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,540
That one's got a custom grill to look
at that grill on that soccer. Whoa.

147
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:23,850
No Ram Truck, Huh? No, no.
Cam's a fan of the ram trucks.

148
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,480
It's okay. I liked drugs.
Sex sells. Yeah, I do too.

149
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,300
But they just don't, there's
something about, you know,

150
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,060
you can't get a ram truck
with supercharger popping
out of the hood like that.

151
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,500
Oh sure. Big whole blowing look, they're
fighting. Oh No, that's Jason Day then.

152
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:41,040
Nevermind. Oh Jason say those
fighting who rock something. That's,

153
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:45,490
I don't think that's the rock. The rocket
was brown. Well, he's the peritoneum.

154
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,790
Xbox. He's got baby oil on
and Jason stayed on. I would,

155
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:54,130
I would help to pull them
aside and go, hey Ron. Yeah,
look at me. Look at me. Run.

156
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,450
Run the other way. But he,
he's fight, right? Yeah.

157
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,380
He's got a martial arts background for
sure. Yeah. Yeah. That was Jason's Day.

158
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:05,820
Them can fight for sure, but, uh, still
run. Hey, look at that rocks. Fucking,

159
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,150
we'll get that answer. Pastor
Jesus. Cool features on that guy.

160
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,950
Young Clint Eastwood. You, hey, how
dare you do that? High cheek bones.

161
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,800
A handsome fella.
I don't understand why he's so upset.

162
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,730
Angry out of the Hollywood guys are angry.
I don't know why.

163
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:30,000
[inaudible]
yeah.
