1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,690
Nobody had ever scientifically
investigated this until an incredible guy.

2
00:00:03,691 --> 00:00:05,910
I got to know cook
Professor Tim [inaudible],

3
00:00:05,911 --> 00:00:09,750
who's at Knox College in
Illinois and Professor Cassa, uh,

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,800
made some really important
breakthroughs in this. So

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,080
there's two ways everyone listening to
your show has two kinds of motivation in

6
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:23,310
their life, right? We're
all a mixture of both.

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,270
So imagine if you played the piano in
the morning cause you love playing the

8
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:28,740
piano. It gives you joy, right?

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,250
That would be what's called an intrinsic
reason to play the piano, right?

10
00:00:32,251 --> 00:00:34,470
You're not doing it to get anything out
of it. That's just, that's the thing.

11
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:36,160
You lot of rice, I was like,
you didn't see was like that.

12
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,070
Bu Writing is like that for me.

13
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:41,250
Everyone will have something in their
life that just gives them joy as they do

14
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:45,490
it. Right? Okay. Now imagine you
played the piano, not, I dunno,

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,590
not because you love it, but because your
parents are massively pressuring you.

16
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,360
It's their dream view or in a dive bar
that you can't stand to pay the rent or

17
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:55,770
cuts impress a woman.
Right?

18
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,220
That would be what's called an extrinsic
reasons to play the piano, right?

19
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,050
You're not doing it because
that thing gives you joy.

20
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:03,540
You're doing it to get something
further down the line. Right? Now,

21
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:04,890
obviously we're all a mixture of both,

22
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,880
but professor Casio showed a couple
of really interesting things. Firstly,

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,060
the more you are driven
by extrinsic values,

24
00:01:12,061 --> 00:01:14,040
the more your intrinsic
values are starved,

25
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,740
the more likely we are to
become depressed and anxious,

26
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:21,030
but quite significant amount.
He also showed as a culture,

27
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,680
as a society, we have become much more
driven by these junk values, right?

28
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,820
We've become much more driven by think
about how Instagram makes you feel. Sure.

29
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:30,390
Right?

30
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,830
We've become much more driven by
this hollow external sense of it.

31
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,890
Think about something as simple as,
well,

32
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,980
a while ago I was the Elton John's
last night in Caesar's palace, right?

33
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,000
Amazing thing to be at and about half
the fucking room is, is filming it on.

34
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:46,620
That isn't even looking at Elton John.

35
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,740
They're just watching it through their
phone, that that's a small example.

36
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,400
But you can see what they're doing
in order to display their life,

37
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:57,000
to invite envy from other people.
They are not living their life.

38
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,520
No one wants to watch your
shitty video about. And John,

39
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,020
there's a hundred thousands of,
uh,

40
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,350
of videos about and John that are
much better than yours, right?

41
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,600
Why are you doing that?
You're never going to watch it either.

42
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,690
You're doing it to say to
other people, envy me, right?

43
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,810
It doesn't make you feel good in that
room actually makes you feel worse.

44
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:16,440
You're not enjoying the experience and
it makes them feel like shit because it

45
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:18,630
makes you, you're trying to
invite envy in your friends.

46
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,790
That's a small example of a much wider
thing of the kind of junk values that

47
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:24,390
have taken our minds.

48
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,310
So the reason that relates to what you're
asking about Brazil is Presser Kasler

49
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,820
shown there's two sets of solutions to
these junk values taken over our minds.

50
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,760
One is, it's like fucking
air pollution. You know,

51
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,620
get the messaging out of your head.

52
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,970
More 18 month old children know
what the Mcdonald's m means,

53
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,280
the know their own Cerner, their own
last name, right? Um, from the moment it,

54
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:49,980
professor Casap put it to me
from the moment we're born,

55
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,060
we're immersed in a machine that is
designed to get us to neglect what is

56
00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:55,770
important about life,
right?

57
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,340
None of your listeners will lie on their
death beds or think about all the shit

58
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:02,500
they bought and all the likes.
They got an Instagram.

59
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:04,870
They'll think about moments and meaning
and connection. That's like a banal,

60
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,280
obvious thing. But we're constantly
pushed to not think in those terms,

61
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:12,280
to think about, show
it off by spend. Right?

62
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,770
These junk values have
taken over our minds.

63
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,280
So part of the solution is just fucking
get rid of most of this advertising.

64
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,610
Get rid of most of this, you
know, very tightly regulated.

65
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,730
But in doing so,
you limit commerce,

66
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:28,350
you're limiting people's
ability to sell things. You're,

67
00:03:28,351 --> 00:03:31,870
you're changing the current market that
a lot of people don't have any problem

68
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:34,210
with. I know this is a
heresy in the United States,

69
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:36,940
but limits in commercial speech
is fine by me. Yeah. I've,

70
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,940
I think it's fascinating. I think it's a
fascinating discussion, but it is in the,

71
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:42,280
in a sense it's limiting free
speech as well. I mean that,

72
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:43,720
and we have a real problem with that.

73
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,590
The problem with it is that as soon as
you start to put any regulations at all

74
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,430
and you know, he say, Oh, you shouldn't
be allowed to advertising to advertise,

75
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:55,440
even if it's advertising, honestly
about a great product that people were,

76
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,050
we'll have real issues with that.
We already have advertising regulation.

77
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,280
You can't, you can't pop an advert
saying I've found the cure for cancer.

78
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,150
That's what I'm saying. So this is still,
I would argue this is a tightening.

79
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:11,350
So for example, in London there was a big
controversy, um, a couple of years back.

80
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,480
Any billboards. Exactly. So it was this,

81
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,720
it was a billboard of a impossibly hot
women and impossibly hot man and the

82
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:22,060
billboards that something like,
are you beach body ready?

83
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,290
The clear implication being,

84
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,990
if you don't look like these people who
you'll never fucking look like you're

85
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:29,520
not ready to go to the beach. And the
mayor of London City can just said this,

86
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,920
you can't do this. Right. You can
still advertise your bodybuilding,

87
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,210
but that's so silly. I mean, this is
a, it's not an unobtainable ideal.

88
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:40,930
You're looking at two examples of it,
but there are real human beings. Yeah,

89
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:43,660
but that's like, I mean, I know
why I started listening. I mean,

90
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,850
I'm not saying that you
have to be that way,

91
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,540
but if you do want to look like
that man and have that body,

92
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,010
it is a possible goal.
Yeah.

93
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,820
I mean it's not possible for the
vast majority of people, right?

94
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,820
Like if they don't have the
time or the effort, it's not,

95
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,410
but very many people have radically
changed their body. I'm not saying,

96
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,810
not saying you should do it.

97
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,440
I decided this is a possible thing to
do and if you're trying to sell fitness,

98
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,380
wouldn't you sell an example of
someone who's really good at it?

99
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,210
Like if you're trying to
sell a business course,

100
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,040
wouldn't you show a guy with a
giant house and a Ferrari? Like,

101
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,970
this is a guy who's done
really well at business,

102
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,320
look at his penthouse apartment
overlooking Manhattan. You wouldn't show,

103
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,420
you wouldn't say,
well that's an impossible goal.

104
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,300
I'm going to show you a person in a middle
class suburb because this is as good

105
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:30,460
as you're ever going to get.
I think that's a fair point.

106
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,890
I think it's two things going
on, isn't there? There's

107
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:38,320
the freedom of people to market what
they want to do and there's, um,

108
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,580
it's a nanny state issue that people
have a problem with you by saying that

109
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,130
these are impossible
to achieve body goals.

110
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,040
We already have regulation
at these things.

111
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,380
So people don't call
that a nanny state thing.

112
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:54,190
I think just this idea of
regulation, these things, but that,

113
00:05:54,191 --> 00:05:57,280
that is not this.
I don't think there's a good example.

114
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,790
What to I was a better example.

115
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,340
So Professor Kassar said there's two
sets of solutions to these junk valley's

116
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:03,400
problems. There's, um,

117
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,440
get the contaminants out of
the atmosphere sort of thing,

118
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,130
which he says is actually a weaker one
than the second set of solutions is.

119
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,670
So how do we stop people being pumped
full of bullshit, junk valleys, right?

120
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:17,000
Educate them on what is happening to
them and make it less appealing. Well,

121
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:20,270
this is the second part and you've gone
to what I think was the most important

122
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:22,480
part of the research
professor Cassa did see,

123
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,630
was working with a guy called Nathan
Dungan. And Nathan is a hearing to be,

124
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,680
Nathan is a
financial advisor in Minneapolis.

125
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,220
And his job was to work with adults
who were found trouble budgeting and

126
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:38,240
explained budgeting to them
and help them do it right?

127
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,400
And it gets a call from a school.

128
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,910
It was kind of middle class
school wasn't super rich or poor,

129
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,590
it was a middle class,
uh,

130
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,900
where they're having a problem
that the kids at this school,

131
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:51,140
we're becoming obsessed with getting like
the latest Nike sneakers or the latest

132
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,870
iPhone or whatever it was.
And if their parents couldn't afford it,

133
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,990
the kids were really freaking
out. Right? So they say to Nathan,

134
00:06:56,991 --> 00:07:00,020
would you come in and just explain
budgeting to these kids? Right?

135
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,740
So Nathan goes in and he tries to explain
budgeting and quickly realize is these

136
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:05,150
kids don't give a shit about budgetary,
right?

137
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:06,260
There's something else going on here.

138
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,710
They are so obsessed with getting
these things. So with Professor Cassa,

139
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:12,980
he designs this program that
led to really interesting, uh,

140
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,290
breakthrough and it's saying
people can try at home, right?

141
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:18,800
You don't have to do in this context.
So they'd got,

142
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,730
and you can do it just as
adults, but they did it with, uh,

143
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,230
parents and the teenagers,
right? They come in,

144
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:26,960
it was once every couple of
weeks for think four months.

145
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,650
And at first they just say the first
meeting they had, they just said,

146
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:35,210
write a list of everything you have got
to have. They didn't define that right.

147
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,240
And people of course say
like a home, a car, whatever.

148
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,580
But quite quickly people
would say Nike sneakers,

149
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:43,250
the parents would name expensive
things and they got, okay,

150
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,170
tell me how you would feel if
you got these Nike sneakers.
Right. And very rarely,

151
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,330
I only, any of them were like
basketball players where it's like,

152
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:54,170
I need the jump or whatever.
If that's the right phrase. Um,

153
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,890
it was very off ob almost immediately
it's I'd be accepted by the group.

154
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,980
People would envy me, right? These,

155
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,090
these insights are just beneath
the surface where they go,

156
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,120
who put that idea in your head?
Where did you get that idea?

157
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,550
And of course everyone thinks
they're smarter than the ad,

158
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,540
but giving people the ability just
to see how hollow those junk values,

159
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:12,440
where that was the first part,

160
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,500
second part was much more interesting
and took longer than I would have in

161
00:08:15,501 --> 00:08:17,690
future sessions. They'd say, well, okay,

162
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,520
given that's not actually
made you feel better.

163
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,760
What are moments in your life
when you have felt satisfied,

164
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,170
happy in a flow state? What are
things that are meaningful to you?

165
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,740
People you know,
a whole range of things.

166
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,180
Playing sports or play music or
reading, whatever it was, right?

167
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,440
And they say,
okay,

168
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,210
how could we build more of that into
your life and less of these junk values?

169
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:40,910
How could you do more of this
every week and just meeting?

170
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,860
We'd have these conversations
in our culture very often.

171
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,310
Just meeting once every couple of weeks
and checking in with each other and go,

172
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:48,680
actually, I managed to play
guitar for an hour every day.

173
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,770
I managed on Saturday to take
my kid to the beach and we went,

174
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,260
or whatever it can to stifle materialism.
What it led to,

175
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:57,010
six is monitored by professor Cassar.

176
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,930
It led to a significant shifts in
people's valleys that they, they, they,

177
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,010
they had a significant decrease in junk
ponies and a significant increase in,

178
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,490
in a more meaningful intrinsic values.

179
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,570
And we know that that correlates with
lower depression and anxiety over time.

180
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,770
The weird thing is I sometimes feel like
with all my, we both my books chasing,

181
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:17,451
screaming,
lost connection.

182
00:09:17,451 --> 00:09:20,970
So I sometimes feel like I'm giving
people permission to know the thing they

183
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:21,660
already know.
