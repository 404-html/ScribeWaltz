1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,970
Yeah. Which brings me to the one thing
that I wanted to get to before we leave.

2
00:00:02,971 --> 00:00:06,240
This is a waterboarding.
Yeah. And this is,

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,260
this is something that came
up because you were defending,

4
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:14,400
what does her Gail, Gina, Gina, what
does her name has bell hospital.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,580
And she is the person that was
being appointed by to lead the CIA.

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,100
Yup.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,890
And there was a bunch of people that
were saying that she shouldn't be because

8
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:26,760
she advocated torture and you uh,
to defend her,

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,880
decided to um,
get water

10
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:30,763
boarded.
Yup.

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,470
We've actually been talking about this
for the past hour and a half. Yeah.

12
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,760
We have, we've been talking about, um,

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,390
the slow erosion of,
of the human condition.

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,300
US getting softer and US getting
weaker and US getting, um,

15
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:51,310
norphine the edges and finding the
easy outs and the easy solution. Um,

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,870
the conversation of middle ground,

17
00:00:52,871 --> 00:00:56,830
finding a way that we can communicate
with people and have a discussion. Um, we,

18
00:00:56,831 --> 00:01:01,450
so we've been, we've been having this
discussion for the past 90 minutes and um,

19
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:06,620
what I have is a bunch of people
that are sane what something is,

20
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,420
but they don't know what that
is. Man. I know what torture is.

21
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,080
I've seen it in Africa,
I've seen it in South America,

22
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,720
I've seen it in the Middle East.
I've seen it on almost,

23
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:21,440
I'm pushing 20 trips overseas
in a military capacity,

24
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,240
a handful of combat deployments,
you know, from looking for poachers,

25
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:31,160
human traffic, gears, drug
cartel, um, kind of piracy,

26
00:01:31,161 --> 00:01:32,270
the things that I have done.

27
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:35,510
Like you want to talk about
knowing intimately what torture is.

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,430
I fucking know what torture is.

29
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:43,580
Pouring water on somebodies face is
not torture Kate. If you starve them,

30
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,940
if you beat them, if you isolate
them, if they're there for, you know,

31
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:51,610
you're the only getting the yes, we can
start adding things onto it. But the,

32
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,090
the thing that was the most irritating
was everybody's just throwing out this,

33
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,150
well, let's talk about morality. And this
woman is immoral to be in this position.

34
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,790
I remember people jumping to their deaths
on nine 11 because they didn't look at

35
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,240
burnt alive,
right?

36
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:11,270
And then I saw a guy on his knees and
have his throat slit open by somebody's

37
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:15,930
pulling his hair back and sliding
that knife across his throat.

38
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,170
That was one of the guys
that she interrogated. Not,

39
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,500
I'm not saying two wrongs make a right,

40
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,560
but she interrogated them to get a
question, to get questions out of them,

41
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:26,910
to try to save more Americans.
The intent was to try to save more lives.

42
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,580
They say, okay, well if it's not
that bad, then why did it work?

43
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,640
And this is why.
And this is what nobody understands.

44
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:39,510
And it's because they can't understand
the difference between the easy way and

45
00:02:39,511 --> 00:02:44,130
the hard way is that because these people
that we were waterboarding are cowards.

46
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,630
They were pussies. They're impotent
little bullies their whole entire lives.

47
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,260
If I put you on that water board,
I could waterboard you for days.

48
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:55,500
You have your moral convictions and you
would never change cause you believe in

49
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:59,160
what's right and wrong and that's a great
and beautiful thing. They're not you.

50
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,620
They are pieces of shit that that throw
acid on little girls that flood planes

51
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:08,890
into buildings because it's capitalist
that that's who these people are.

52
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:13,300
And if they're only tough when they're
surrounded by 60 70 other of their

53
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:18,160
friends, but you take one of them
away from that and you put them in a,

54
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:21,130
in a position where they're powerless
and that's what waterboarding is.

55
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:25,540
The powerless and they cave
and they cower in seconds.

56
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,540
Like I don't need to drive
a nail through their hands.

57
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,860
I don't need to pull their teeth out.

58
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:33,700
I don't take a drill bit and drive it
through their fingernails. That's torture.

59
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,370
This is us pouring water on a cowards
face and they freak out and people can't

60
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:44,371
understand that because they can't
understand what these people are and their

61
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:47,070
animals, the, the, these,

62
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,600
these aren't beautiful religious people
that are trying to do the best thing for

63
00:03:51,601 --> 00:03:52,434
the families.

64
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,750
These people were the worst of archive.

65
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:01,770
These were the Nazis of the 1940s but
this is the current version of it in the

66
00:04:01,831 --> 00:04:06,390
these radical fanatics that are doing
anything for any reason to hurt anybody so

67
00:04:06,391 --> 00:04:09,420
they can feel better about themselves
and you take them out of that power,

68
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,310
they take them out of that control.

69
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,790
You take them out of that opportunity
where they can be the bully and they're

70
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:19,080
just shadows of themselves and then they
give you everything that you need and

71
00:04:19,081 --> 00:04:22,470
what you need is an opportunity to
save more lives. Well, there's two,

72
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,860
two things that were discussed about this.
One,

73
00:04:25,861 --> 00:04:30,861
that your situation that you were in was
not in any way similar to the situation

74
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:33,390
that they were in because you
were doing it with your friends.

75
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:38,000
You knew you were going to be okay.
You willingly did this. The the,

76
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:42,840
the whole process was very controlled.
You, you weren't being held by people,

77
00:04:42,841 --> 00:04:47,550
spoke a different language and a
a country that hates you. It's,

78
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,400
it's a situation where
you knew you were safe,

79
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,960
so you could relax yourself and calm down
and tolerate it to the point where you

80
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,860
knew that you, you would be okay.
Yep. And what was the other side?

81
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,270
The other side is if torture works,

82
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:07,830
isn't that the best form of
torture you're going to be? Okay.

83
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,310
I mean, if, if torture does work
and I don't know of torture works,

84
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,110
I've never been tortured.
I've never been around torture.

85
00:05:13,111 --> 00:05:16,880
And I know there's a debate both in both
torture doesn't work. It doesn't work.

86
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,240
Doesn't work. So that's not torture. No.
So you think you feel like that works,

87
00:05:21,241 --> 00:05:22,200
but torture doesn't.

88
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,383
So I think,

89
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:28,920
I think maybe we're arguing
about vernacular and verbs
or you're forcing someone

90
00:05:28,921 --> 00:05:31,660
to do something they don't want to do and
you're, you're freaking them out. Yeah.

91
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,690
You're doing something physical to them.

92
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,720
So I think we just have
to define torture. If, if,

93
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:43,710
if it's me doing something to somebody
that makes them uncomfortable is torture.

94
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:44,671
I mean,

95
00:05:44,671 --> 00:05:49,650
me asking a pointed question at somebody's
in an interrogation room down to LAPD

96
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,280
could be torture. Right. You know? Um,

97
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,000
if you smack him in the face as it become
torture, is that torture? Right? Um, well,

98
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,010
I don't know if I hit him with a

99
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,660
phone book.
Maybe the problem is the word.

100
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,810
Maybe the problem is defining
the word you're, I mean, they,

101
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,050
then they called it enhanced
irrigation techniques when,

102
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,980
if you're trying to get information
out of someone that would save American

103
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:13,400
lives, it seems to me, I may be ignorant,

104
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,330
but waterboarding seems to me to be
one of the most humane ways to do it.

105
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,020
I agree with that. You're not going to
do any permanent damage to the person.

106
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:25,790
It's not like what they did a John
Mccain when he was a prisoner in Vietnam,

107
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,090
and that disturbed the shit out of me
when that guy was on Fox News and he

108
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:32,810
called them songbird McCain because
he was, he was saying that, you know,

109
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,660
terrorism,
that torture rather worked on Mccain.

110
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:39,380
Like how could you stoop like that? I
mean, how could you do that? I mean, you,

111
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:43,430
you know what that guy's been through to
humiliate him and humiliate yourself by,

112
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,930
by, by taking that position on television,
like that was so disappointing.

113
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,573
It's

114
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,950
about usable information. We're, we're,

115
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:58,220
we're questioning and if you cross that
threshold of torture where you are doing

116
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,920
damage,
physical damage,

117
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,600
where they'll tell you anything that's
not usable information that you're going

118
00:07:04,601 --> 00:07:06,200
to say that you've, you've been, you know,

119
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,610
dating your producer for seven years and
secretly like, I could get you to ace,

120
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,000
say anything under the right
conditions that doesn't do it.

121
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:16,410
You just want to stop the pain. Yeah.
Just anything to make it stop. Um,

122
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:20,680
that's not what was happening here. And,
and when we start talking about morality,

123
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,890
if they're saying, okay, if this
is a moral act, then then, okay,

124
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,930
this make me and all of my friends
that have done all sorts of tea,

125
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,710
some in some cases,
terrible things.

126
00:07:29,711 --> 00:07:33,940
Are we now a moral people because we
did it in the interest of protecting our

127
00:07:33,941 --> 00:07:38,830
country and serving our country and,
and providing protection for our freedoms.

128
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,100
And,
um,

129
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,050
I know those are cliche phrases that
people grab onto and I don't want to,

130
00:07:44,051 --> 00:07:47,260
but it then by extension,

131
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:51,100
throwing and lobbying those
accusations at her extend to, uh,

132
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,920
to me and to the things that I've done.

133
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:59,340
And I think I'm a very moral person and
I try to be a good person and in every

134
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:03,160
way I can imagine, I'm
not perfect, I'm not.

135
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,640
But I try and the politics of
bleeding over and misusing words,

136
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:13,130
manipulating everything
just so it fits your agenda,

137
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,690
but nobody's in the middle of ground.

138
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:17,630
Nobody's agreeing and nobody
has the best interest at heart.

139
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:22,430
And that's the people like
the best interest should
always be serving the people

140
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,500
and none of them are doing that.

141
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:28,760
They only care about what is going to get
them reelected or what's going to give

142
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:29,401
them more power,

143
00:08:29,401 --> 00:08:32,660
which can even more money from the lobby
or what's going to give them more clout

144
00:08:32,661 --> 00:08:33,494
for the next vote.

145
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,400
What's going to give a little handout
from the president or what's, you know,

146
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:40,040
whatever games that play that happened
on the beltway. That's what the,

147
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,550
and that was an example of that in,

148
00:08:41,551 --> 00:08:46,390
in the most horrible of ways
because it came down to human lives.

149
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:51,100
It came down to somebody who had been
serving their country since the 80s and

150
00:08:51,101 --> 00:08:55,000
the best way that she knew how in the
ways that we're legal for her to do it and

151
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,350
everybody else just manipulating
the narrative to fit their agenda.

152
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,880
When I'm just sitting here being like,

153
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,540
how about the people and how about
freedom? Who's fighting for us? Is it,

154
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,360
are you guys just going to
keep bickering about this?

155
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,280
So me strap strapping myself to
that board. Um, I'll tell you,

156
00:09:11,281 --> 00:09:12,000
it's harder.

157
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,420
Do what's easy is to lay they're strapped
and have somebody put water on your

158
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:18,930
face. Do it's hard. When
I did to Steven Crowder,

159
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:24,210
watch his hands where he'd reach
up and pull the, he couldn't have,

160
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,150
he couldn't take it.
He would pull the rag off his face.

161
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,720
See many times I pulled the rag
off my face, not once, right?

162
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,310
Every single time I said,
no, no. Poor longer. No, no.
Use the host. Use the bucket.

163
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:36,360
Right now you're at a two.

164
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:41,070
I need you at an eight now I
need CIA interrogation friends,

165
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:44,010
right? And I'm sitting there
willingly with my hands.

166
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,550
What the sensation of me drowning as
that water's running into my sinuses

167
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,920
showing that was intentional.
I understand. People are
like, oh no, he was safe.

168
00:09:52,921 --> 00:09:53,970
He wasn't even tied down.

169
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I did that to demonstrate how a man of
resolve can do it effortlessly and how

170
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:05,250
it's not torture because I could willingly
lay there with my hands free to pull

171
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:09,390
the rag off at any juncture. But I did
it. I just sat there and I asked for more.

172
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,610
I understand that,

173
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,120
but I also understand the position
that people take where they say,

174
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:19,470
you knew you were safe, and so this is
why you had that sort of resolve. You are.

175
00:10:19,471 --> 00:10:23,010
You're not in enemy soil,
being interrogated by Isis,

176
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,670
being strapped down by them where
you didn't know what was next.

177
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:30,600
If you do think this, what would be
next? Let's say Rachel Maddow from MSNBC,

178
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,830
because we agree on so much.
If she's like, Hey, I want
you to come onto my show.

179
00:10:34,831 --> 00:10:38,730
I'm going to bring in
five CIA interrogators and
we're going to do it live.

180
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,110
You're in control of nothing. Do you
think the result would be any different?

181
00:10:43,111 --> 00:10:46,610
For me? Not the same, because you're on a
television show and you're still, you're,

182
00:10:46,611 --> 00:10:49,770
you're Americans are going to do this
to you. You haven't been captured.

183
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,190
You're not an enemy soil. You're
not, you know, how far did on,

184
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,510
how far do we have to go?

185
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:59,540
You have to kind of be the person who's
really captured is really captured.

186
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:04,290
It's not a game. It's like
if you get choked out in the
street, you can't tap out,

187
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:04,830
right?

188
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,430
If you get into a physical fight to the
death of someone and they take your back,

189
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,080
you can't tap out. Right. And in this
situation, you know, you can tap out.

190
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,920
You know that even if it's
CIA interrogating you and
they're yelling at you,

191
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,270
there's a part of your brain that
knows I'm on Rachel Maddow show.

192
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:25,960
They don't kill soldiers on Rachel
Maddow show. This is true. Um,

193
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,440
so I don't know how I could
have better have illustrated.

194
00:11:28,441 --> 00:11:29,820
I think you did a fantastic job.

195
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:33,480
I think the problem lies and
it's impossible to really
recreate it without you

196
00:11:33,481 --> 00:11:36,000
being an actual prisoner of war.
Um,

197
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:42,110
do what we do a reverse the roles we're
talking about snatching these guys from

198
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:47,880
their bomb making facility in
whisking them to upgrade and,

199
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,680
and pouring water on their face.

200
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:54,850
What happens to me and my friends when
were captured? Oh, we waterboarded no,

201
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,290
no, no, no I'm not,

202
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,900
I'm not saying that what they do to
us makes what we do to them. Right.

203
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,690
But I'm saying is, um, it's better.

204
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,960
I'm saying it, it's better. I mean
since what I was saying before,

205
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:07,390
if it is shorter,
if you want to use the word torture,

206
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:09,820
like we'd use the word drugs,
right?

207
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:13,990
Drugs are coffee and it's also
heroin, right? They're all drugs.

208
00:12:13,991 --> 00:12:17,950
Caffeine is a drug, right. Torture.
If you're just going to say torture,

209
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,640
I'll take that torture every day
because he knows what that is. Yeah.

210
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:24,610
Cause even if it sucks, yeah,
I'm going to be burnt alive.

211
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,990
I'm going to be steadily
right. Carefully, methodically,

212
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,510
painfully murdered.
Yeah.

213
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,000
And that's my only option there.

214
00:12:35,001 --> 00:12:37,940
There is never any other option.
If I got captured,

215
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,720
there's no moral equivalency. I think
we could both agree there's no, I mean,

216
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,560
between us and them, there's
not, but here's the thing.

217
00:12:45,561 --> 00:12:50,561
Mccain himself said that she shouldn't
be appointed because she willingly

218
00:12:50,631 --> 00:12:55,070
participated in torture. He said that.
Yeah. The, what did you think about that?

219
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,420
I have one. Respect his opinion.
I, the things that he has done,

220
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,860
whether we agree on things
are, is irrelevant. His,

221
00:13:02,861 --> 00:13:04,630
his resume speaks for a spell.
I agree.

222
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:09,780
And I think very few people could
speak to torture better than him.

223
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:10,980
I agree with that as well.
Um,

224
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:16,020
so him coming from that position and
saying that she isn't eligible to serve,

225
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:20,620
um, is a very powerful statement. Um,

226
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:25,210
I also feel that I'm pretty intimately
familiar with torture and that I

227
00:13:25,211 --> 00:13:28,180
understand the full spectrum of,

228
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,610
of what somebody can do selflessly
for their country and um,

229
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:36,430
selfless selfishly for their own
satisfaction as a psychopath. Um,

230
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:40,660
like Zarqawi's enforcer that would go
around and kill people in front of their

231
00:13:40,661 --> 00:13:43,720
own family members had carried
around a pat battery power drill.

232
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,680
And I saw that we tracked him.
So

233
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:55,420
I also know that when she was doing all
of these things for her whole entire

234
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,830
career, one, they were,

235
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:01,820
you have to look at the context of
the time and what was happening.

236
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:05,030
Um, and when she did every
single one of those things,

237
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,750
they were authorized techniques.
They were encouraged,

238
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:12,680
they were successful in some
degrees, um, to some degree.

239
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:17,120
And so she was trying to do the best
that she could in the, with the,

240
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,750
in some cases limitation that she had.
Um,

241
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:26,380
and I think that is a trait that I want
in somebody leaving the CIA that is that

242
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,340
they're going to do the best that they
can with what they have and what they're

243
00:14:31,341 --> 00:14:33,350
allowed to do.
And

244
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:35,170
Aye,

245
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,780
I like that. Yeah. Muscle
bulldog. I realize that,

246
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,860
but this isn't someone who's
talking about this in the, you know,

247
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,120
the comfort of a board room.
This is someone who's dealing with it in,

248
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,260
in time of war and you're dealing with
some of the most horrible people that

249
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,170
we've ever experienced it or making
these videos of cutting journalists heads

250
00:14:50,171 --> 00:14:54,260
off and sending them to their families.
Yeah. I mean this is, this is,

251
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:59,290
this is really what we were experiencing
when people were deciding to use these

252
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:04,520
enhanced derogation techniques.
This is what they were up against.

253
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:08,340
This isn't something that you
can discuss in a classroom and,

254
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,440
and get a full sense of the tone and what
was happening in these people's lives.

255
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:18,540
Nine 11 was the tip of the
iceberg when that happened there,

256
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,560
there were hundreds of other plans
to do similar things with Dev.

257
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,480
That one was just successful.

258
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,880
They had been trying others and
they have tried other sense,

259
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,730
whether it's a shoe bomb,
whether it's a Paris train,

260
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,500
whether it's a San Bernardino
bombing, whether it's a, a, uh, uh,

261
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,240
a garbage truck and France, you know,
or London Bridge. It's any, any, they,

262
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:44,310
they have consistently been trying to do
that and duplicate and replicate that.

263
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:50,370
The reason that it hasn't happened again
to that scale to that level is because

264
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:55,830
of the uncompromising selflessness
of Kiros trying to protect Americans.

265
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:04,290
Now, I don't want to go into what is the
greater good [inaudible] are we losing

266
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,990
morality coming? That's a rabbit hole
that we could talk about forever. But man,

267
00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:10,280
I just want to preserve life.

268
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,250
Why do you think that concept
is so hard for people to grasp?

269
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,413
Because that's scary.

270
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,770
Well not just that,

271
00:16:15,771 --> 00:16:20,771
but the concept that the reason why this
hasn't happened more often is because

272
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,160
of these people doing the heart hard

273
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,993
work.

274
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,020
Why is that so hard for
people to understand that
increase your skin hard work?

275
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:32,100
I just made a gut MTV show just so they
could see for the first time that people

276
00:16:32,101 --> 00:16:34,570
work hard so they can have
food and they have work hearts.

277
00:16:34,571 --> 00:16:37,050
They get of oil and
they power that people.

278
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:42,660
They look at a post when I don't have
a shirt on everybody says man tinted,

279
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:48,150
loving being off. You sorta. I've looked
the same since I was 19 years old.

280
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,690
I have looked exactly like this with
the same eight pack with the same muscle

281
00:16:51,691 --> 00:16:54,120
definition since I was an 18 year old kid.

282
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:57,240
I don't even know how many times I've
been tested from the military for Usada

283
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,410
two different events.

284
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,610
I've been cleaned my whole entire career
but nobody can in their mind they can't

285
00:17:02,611 --> 00:17:07,500
understand. To get from here
to there is hard work. No,

286
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:10,290
there has to be an easier way and it has
to be steroids or it has to be this or

287
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:13,050
it has to be that. It's the same way.
They're protected and they're safe,

288
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:18,260
but they can't grasp the idea of the hard
work that it took to keep them there.
