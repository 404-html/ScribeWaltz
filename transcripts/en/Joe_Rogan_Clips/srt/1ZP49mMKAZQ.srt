1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,090
Her low freak bitches. See I, I,

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,240
there's Tyron Woodley thing is very tricky
because in my mind like I see that he

3
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:13,260
wanted to win the fight period.
That is the best way to win the fight.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,770
If this guy was only offering a certain
amount of offense and you could stuff

5
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:20,220
that offense and land your shots
and continue to pile up points,

6
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:23,580
which he did and don't ever
put yourself at risk, I get it.

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,030
But I also get the Dana white
point of view where he's like,

8
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:27,930
you've got to sell tickets.

9
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:31,200
Like people are paying to see you fight
and if people are holding up cell phones

10
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:32,880
and swinging them through the rafters,
you know,

11
00:00:32,881 --> 00:00:36,370
because everybody's bored cause they
don't want to watch it anymore. And his,

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,430
his thought is like,
you've got to sell tickets.

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,060
And who's the greatest take
down artists in UFC history?

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,600
George Saint Pierre Towards
San Pio versus Woodley. Yeah,

15
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:47,960
but Woodley apparently,
um,

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,880
because of this fight they're
talking about GSP versus Bisping now.

17
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,620
Oh they got to go to woodland.
Come on. That's the only guy.

18
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,960
If GSP just take Woodley down,
nobody can.

19
00:00:57,961 --> 00:00:59,850
But what if they just tried
to take each other down,

20
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:04,590
back and forth and everybody went crazy
again. Kim Down repeatedly. If he did,

21
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,950
he'd, that'd be great too. But what if he
did? Either way, I want to see the fight.

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,800
Here's the cause,
the cause Woodley has a style.

23
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,230
Some people don't like it.
Some people like it,

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,090
some people appreciate it or whatever.

25
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:22,080
But the only guy that has
a shot to beat Woodley,

26
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:26,820
the only guy would be the best takedown,
best MMA takedown artist of all time.

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,250
He has like a million
takedowns in the UFC.

28
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,970
He's the only guy that would be able
to, if GSP can do it, no one can.

29
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,630
He's going to have to just
like, yeah, very good striker.

30
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,290
I think he's leg kicks.
This is what you'd have GSP saying.

31
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,810
Like we've got to go to the
pro wrestling angle. You know,

32
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,680
I have tired of sitting at
home watching boring fights.

33
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:51,340
That's bad GSP impression. I bit
him saying like, enough identity.

34
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,760
I want my sound like Arnold.
Kenny made it here. Some Ivs.

35
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,170
Um, I don't know. Bisping's
I want any five. That's kind
of weird. Is he saying, man,

36
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:03,300
it's going to be too hard to
make one 70 without the ivs?

37
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:04,980
I think he was willing
to fight either fight.

38
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:09,210
I think he was willing to do one 70
or one AVT Woodley. GSP would be huge.

39
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,600
That would, that would be the biggest
fight for what I'm not impressed with

40
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,440
because who else is there at
one seven eight that could they,

41
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,270
it has a chance of taking him down.
Well, Robbie Lawler, since he just won,

42
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,330
you would have to look at Robbie being
one of the top contenders and he would

43
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:25,110
just brawl with him.

44
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,600
He's willing to brawl with and that's
the only way you're gonna beat him if he

45
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:31,680
can avoid the big bomb that he got hit
with in the first five. Yeah. You know,

46
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,543
and you've got to think,

47
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,230
Robbie Lawler is coming off of
five round war with Rory Macdonald,

48
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,970
five round war with Carlos Condit,
war with Johny Hendricks,

49
00:02:41,971 --> 00:02:45,450
war war, war, war. It's
all war. Every fight.

50
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:48,930
He's in his fucking war.
So like, I think the,

51
00:02:48,931 --> 00:02:53,190
him having that year off was giant.
And then he fought cowboy.

52
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:55,230
And towards the end he
was coming after cowboy.

53
00:02:55,231 --> 00:02:58,560
He was hurting cowboy to the body.
He hit Cabo with some big shots.

54
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:00,940
I felt like a lot of people
disagree with that decision,

55
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:04,530
but I felt like I give Robbie the first
round because he jumped all over cowboy

56
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:07,690
in the beginning and was,
I think it was enough to win the round.

57
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,770
Although I think Cabo is getting the
better of the exchanges towards the NSL

58
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:16,090
silting the volume of it and the impact
went to Robbie second round went cowboy

59
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:16,924
pretty big.

60
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,470
But then Robbie rallied in the third
round and I think he dominated the third

61
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:22,420
round and I think he
hurt cowboy a few times.

62
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,090
I think that would have been
an amazing five round fight.

63
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,910
That would have been an incredibly even
remember who won the fight. Robbie?

64
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:30,580
One very close decision. I think
it was a split decision. I don't,

65
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:35,170
I'm not sure that my grade five brain
is scrambled. It was a great fight.

66
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,340
It was a great fight. Both gave, both
took. It was, it was war. It was chaos,

67
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,030
you know, and in Cowboy, um, definitely
caught him with some clean shots.

68
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:45,130
He hit him with some real good knees.
The body as well.

69
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,970
Cowboy landed a lot of great shit, but
you know, Robbie looked like Robbie again.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,940
He looked like the Robbie Lawler that
won the title. It looks like a killer.

71
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,750
He looked like the same spooky dude that
just keeps coming after you until he

72
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:57,850
puts you away. That's what he
looked like in the third round.

73
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,110
Third round in particular.

74
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:03,010
Really looked like it was falling back
into the old groove again. So there's him,

75
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,993
you know?

76
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:12,640
Yeah.
