1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,690
I'm so fascinated by animals and
just animal life and adaptation.

2
00:00:03,691 --> 00:00:06,810
I think it's one of the more interesting
things about this planet definitely is

3
00:00:06,811 --> 00:00:10,890
these weird organisms that are
trying to figure out their way to,

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,540
to survival,
you know,

5
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:16,350
and then we're responding and moving and
changing and we're always finding new

6
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:20,190
ones. Like I found a fucking
snake. I posted it up on um,

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,980
on Twitter like a week or so ago.

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,120
A snake that has a tail that
looks like a fake spider.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,640
Have you seen that fucking thing?
I'm not sure.

10
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:32,910
What do you know the species of it? I
know the species. I think it's from,

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,750
I think it's from Iran and
its a rattle snake. Yeah.

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,840
Scale scaled pit viper. Is that it? Yeah.

13
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:43,410
So Viper not allow snake born Viper Viper.
If you seen that thing.

14
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,810
I know what they are.
Yeah it's incredible.

15
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,890
It looks like a spider and it tricks
birds into coming down and try to snatch

16
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:53,190
the spider. Here we go.
The Iranians spider,

17
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:56,970
that viper spider tailed
viper like look at its tail.

18
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,860
That is crazy. I mean, I'm looking at
that in a video and it looks like a bug,

19
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:02,610
right?

20
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:07,140
And so this thing moves its tail and it
perfectly blends into the rock around it.

21
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:11,190
Like look at that and that amount
of camouflage and adaptation.

22
00:01:11,191 --> 00:01:15,900
Like how does that happen?
It's incredible. This boom,

23
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,920
oh, got you bitch done Zo, the birds.
Like what was that? That almost got me.

24
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,750
Yeah, that's insane. What an adaptation.

25
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,650
I mean like you see the Angler fish,
that's a very bizarre adaptation as well.

26
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,250
Same thing just out of the head.
Yeah, I, it's, it's unbelievable.

27
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:36,300
I mean the fact that creatures
can create that without, you know,

28
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:38,790
it's not like they're doing
it knowingly, right. Was some,

29
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,570
some handful of snakes at one time started
wagging their tail and realizing the

30
00:01:42,571 --> 00:01:47,571
birds came in and then over generational
time does tail evolved little spikes

31
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:51,480
and little things and all of a sudden
you have this whole population of animals

32
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:55,650
that looked like that same. What is it?
How the fuck does that happen? I mean,

33
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:56,610
how does something grow?

34
00:01:56,611 --> 00:02:01,020
Something like that allure grows a
lure off of its head and he's like,

35
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:05,610
hey look, it's something for you. No,
you want to eat it. Look at the outline.

36
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,800
Oh my God, that's got a
worm. That'd be the thing.

37
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:10,800
Literally has like a fishing worm,
like a bass worm.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,430
I mean it's,
it's so amazing.

39
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:19,431
All of this adaptation and all of these
look at that fucking monster with a

40
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:21,960
light growing and it's got
a flashlight on its head,

41
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:27,470
but just it's easy how much adaptation
there is and how all these things sort of

42
00:02:28,051 --> 00:02:29,280
work together,
right?

43
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:34,281
Like there's the bacteria and the fungi
and the plant life and the animal life

44
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:39,750
and the predators and the prey
and it all sort of works together.

45
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:43,440
And when something doesn't work, it just
sort of drops off. And then the, the,

46
00:02:43,441 --> 00:02:47,890
the system sort of resets itself in a
new order. I mean, to me there is no,

47
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,860
you saying it's one of the
most fascinating things to me.

48
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:53,640
There is nothing more fascinating. Like
I'm, you know, I'm obsessed with it.

49
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,070
I live for it because I
find it so interesting.

50
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,660
Now when you study
these things and you do,

51
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,830
do you ever try to think like
how the fuck that happen?

52
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:06,580
Like if you see that
that spider tailed snake,

53
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:11,230
is there anyone that has like an
idea like that this was, you know,

54
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,250
this was just a lucky break that this
one snake had a freaky tail and then he

55
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:19,030
got the fuck a lot does. He ate a lot
of birds. The idea, man, you just,

56
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:21,660
I swear to God, you just summed
it up like that is the idea.

57
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,420
W one or two or three snakes
kind of got this adaptation,

58
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,340
just a random random genetic sequencing
that led to maybe a white watch on the

59
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:35,120
tail. Something unique, not seem like that
though. It seems like they fashioned it,

60
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,180
but over time over it they did,
but over millennia,

61
00:03:38,181 --> 00:03:41,840
right over thousands or tens of thousands
or hundreds of thousands of years.

62
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,380
The one what happened was say there's two
snakes with a white spot on their tail.

63
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,710
Then they have a baby and it
has little bit of deformation.

64
00:03:48,711 --> 00:03:50,360
Write a little thing sticking out.

65
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,900
Then that snake all of a sudden catches
more birds than the rest of the snakes.

66
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,830
That snake now reproduces offspring
and its offspring that has a little bit

67
00:03:57,831 --> 00:03:59,900
bigger of a spike,
catches more birds.

68
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:03,890
And so those become the prized
animals to reproduce with,

69
00:04:03,891 --> 00:04:08,390
to continue the gene pool. And so
that's what happens. It keeps evolving.

70
00:04:08,391 --> 00:04:09,500
It's like a peacock,
right?

71
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,800
But this crazy big tail that
it's attracting mates with,

72
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,900
it's not useful to the bird.
You know,

73
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:18,530
that's entirely made for showmanship
for peacocking if you will.

74
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,790
And it over generational time. It gets
bigger and crazier and more elaborate,

75
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,820
more colorful,
and the females literally flock to them.

76
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,540
And that's the animal that continues on.
What I really wish there was a way,

77
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,180
and maybe there will be some time in the
future where they're going to be able

78
00:04:33,181 --> 00:04:36,870
to show you with like some sort
of a super computer sequencing.

79
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,750
Would they be able to look at the
DNA of this thing and say, oh,

80
00:04:39,751 --> 00:04:41,640
this is the exact progression,
right?

81
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:44,130
This is what it started off with
and this is what it became, right?

82
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:48,030
This is how some sketchy looking forest
chicken became a peacock. Totally.

83
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,271
You know,

84
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:53,271
this is how some freaky snake became
perfectly adapted to its environment.

85
00:04:53,671 --> 00:04:58,070
I mean, that thing looks exactly like the
rock that it sits on. It's perfect. Yeah.

86
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,870
It is incredible. Like I would, I'm like
you, I'd love to know who patient zero is.

87
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,130
Who's the, who's the first one. Yeah.

88
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,550
Because stupid people like may
look at that and they'd go, okay,

89
00:05:07,551 --> 00:05:10,340
well that's gotta be a plan that's got
to just something as a higher power.

90
00:05:10,341 --> 00:05:13,610
This is something that like, is looking
after these things and making them,

91
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:18,610
making them evolve this way.
Right, right. It's, I mean,
it's, it's super interesting.
