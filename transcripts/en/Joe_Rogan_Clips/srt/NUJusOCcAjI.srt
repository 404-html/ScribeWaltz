1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,090
I mean, and I, I look at this say cause
I've worked with uh, with mark the Khasi.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,670
Casey. Yeah. Physically. I
mean just God given abilities,

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,590
but he just doesn't have the
intelligence to make all that shit work.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,350
He's screaming at the TV
right now, you know. I know.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,630
And I say that I say that I,

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,320
and I say that with all due
respect because he's my main guy,

7
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,490
isn't he a young guy? Mark? Yeah. He's,
I mean early to mid twenties. Yeah.

8
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:29,040
Maybe just trying to figure it
out. Yeah. And that's what it is.

9
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:31,050
He's trying to figure it out and it
kind of pushed him a little fast.

10
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:33,150
So he didn't have a, you
know, a lot, a ton of shit.

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,820
Ones have some Edsons
had some ups and downs.

12
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,970
Cowboy fire was a big down, I
mean he's had, could be pipe,

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,030
it was a big down, oh
yeah, that was terrifying.

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,570
Fight doesn't even realize how God
could, could be Biz. Oh, I know. Yeah.

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,050
That was like,

16
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,680
that's the fight that like put Khabib
on the map really for everybody to say,

17
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,170
Matt, who's going to beat this
guy? And what he did to him.

18
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,920
Who's going to beat this guy.
Yeah.

19
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:01,860
But that's what I've always said is that
like if you had to pick like one thing

20
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,900
that you're good at,
like what's the most important thing?

21
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:07,680
It seems to me to be wrestling
because the wrestlers can just,

22
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,970
if you get a like a real high level
wrestler, they just dictate what happens.

23
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,340
They dictate where the fight takes place.
I don't think there is,

24
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,700
I mean you have to know how to strike.
You have to know the other things as well,

25
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,450
but it feels like if you have a
pyramid of shit that's important,

26
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,520
it feels like at the bottom is wrestling
and that motherfucker wrestles better

27
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:30,940
than anybody in that division. Yeah. I
mean, but see, I disagree kind of. Okay.

28
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,310
And here's why. Um, I don't necessarily,
because when we talk about wrestling,

29
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:37,560
I don't think it's necessarily
the techniques of restaurant.

30
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,660
I think it's just a waiter brought up,
they're brought up different in Pakistan,

31
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,630
not, not only daggers, they're
definitely brought up differently,

32
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:48,270
but like any wrestlers just brought
up different, oh, toughness.

33
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,140
A different level of
toughness, a different level,
a level of competitiveness.

34
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,560
So like when you go to Jujitsu school
was first thing you learn how to do his

35
00:01:55,561 --> 00:01:58,530
bowel to Matt and kissed the
instructors ass. That's it.

36
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,290
You know you bout to Matt and and you're
learning self defense and you learn to

37
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:04,620
respect and wrestling. It's not
about that, it's about dominate.

38
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,460
It's about winning and dominating.

39
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,730
So they have years of experience of
doing that. Like just that mindset.

40
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,060
It's also about being uncomfortable all
the time and it's like it or just the

41
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:18,840
room is always rough. It's always
tough. Like you go to a Jujitsu school,

42
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,240
it's a bunch of dudes smoking pot,
land back.

43
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,560
They roll five minutes, sit
back, smoke for 30 role,

44
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:28,620
another five minutes you go to
a wrestling room is hot, sweaty,

45
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,840
they're all uncomfortable or all grinding.

46
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,980
So you take that guy and you
teach them some basic Jujitsu.

47
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,570
You got a champ. Yeah. Hey that this is
the mindset for me. Physical Strength,

48
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,070
physical strength, the grip strength.
I guess so important. Like for me,

49
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:47,100
like grips is everything and in
wrestling you learn a lot of that early.

50
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,900
So I feel like, um, that's kind of the
different searches brought up different,

51
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,970
yeah, I definitely think
there's something to that.

52
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:58,290
And then also being able to cut weight
and still compete. Yeah, I mean,

53
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,430
so I'm always my fighters now.
Like when you have that restaurant,

54
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,520
his parents basically,
if you wrestled in college,

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,380
like you go all your high school years,
you got 50 matches a year,

56
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,830
so you competing 200 times before you
even graduate high school and then you go

57
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:15,520
to college.
If you wrestle in college,

58
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,390
you compete against the best of the best
in the best room and then you fight MMA

59
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,470
is nothing,
there's nothing to you and now you,

60
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:26,230
and then you take a kid off the
street who's never competed before,

61
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,730
they're nervous, they don't perform
well there always at a disadvantage.

62
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:34,660
And as somebody who wrestled,
right, because of the
experiencing competition. Yeah.

63
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:39,400
Yeah. That makes sense. The only thing
about some wrestlers because of the,

64
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:39,841
like,

65
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:44,380
there's like a tightness to wrestling
and some wrestlers just never learned how

66
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:47,650
to be loose with Ca. And
some, some pick it up quick.

67
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,060
It's weird what s the difference.

68
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:52,480
And that's what makes some of them better
than the other ones. When I look at,

69
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,820
you know, obviously Tyron Woodley, he's
got it. He's loose. He's got it. Yeah.

70
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,970
Michael Chandler, when he throw his
right hand, it's loose. Yeah. Yeah. Uh,

71
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,330
but you're right. Some of them just can't
get it. And that's why they struggle.

72
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,620
And they struggle if they fight a wrestler
who can strike. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

73
00:04:09,621 --> 00:04:13,540
It's terrifying for a wrestler who
can't strike to fight a wrestler who can

74
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:16,750
strike is terrifying. Oh
yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

75
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,540
Some dude who can keep it standing
and can fuck you up special.

76
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,150
They can kick too. I
know. I know. But that,

77
00:04:22,151 --> 00:04:23,620
but I think that's another
problem with wrestlers.

78
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:27,400
They fall in love with the striking
earliest Jujitsu guys too. Yeah. Yeah.

79
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,070
And that's, and that's, and, and
that's what messes him up, man.

80
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:32,890
He Fall in love with it and think,
oh, I have to be well rounded,

81
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:35,770
so I have to dedicate all my time
to doing this. And I'm like, man,

82
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:37,300
but you getting worse
at what you're good at.

83
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,760
Why used to watch the George
group Shell fight? I'm like,

84
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:40,800
if you watch that guy fight,

85
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,380
you never know that he was a Brazilian
jujitsu black belt. Come man.

86
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:49,810
I used to get so mad at him.
I'm like, dude, what are you
doing? What are you doing?

87
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,960
Like he,
yeah.

88
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:57,310
I don't know if it was like
fan expectation or just
like in his mind he wanted

89
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:58,020
to be a striker,
but.
