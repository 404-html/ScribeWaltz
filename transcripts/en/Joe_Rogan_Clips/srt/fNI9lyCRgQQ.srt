1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,960
Dude, he wanted to knock that dude out so
bad after he got knocked out in the MMA

2
00:00:03,961 --> 00:00:07,710
fight.
He wanted to knock him out in his rules.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,540
And I think that is what you saw with
Cody this weekend. Too much emotion.

4
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:13,470
One fight.
Yeah man.

5
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:17,520
We were talking about that and watching
the replays like you could see in his

6
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:19,850
face that every shot
he was trying to knock

7
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,480
came out with. As soon as I saw
him walk, I mean not walk out.

8
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:26,530
I said he looked okay walking out as soon
as it's like the bell rung, I was like,

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,740
he just did. He looked a
little stiff. Yeah. You know,

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,280
and I was hoping he would shake it
off, get in the rhythm, like land,

11
00:00:34,281 --> 00:00:36,460
a couple jabs, just like,
you know, we were working on,

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,420
when I spar with them a couple
times leading up to the TJ fight,

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,140
I'll go up to Alpha male to do my
wrestling. And a lot of my grappling, um,

14
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:44,621
you know,

15
00:00:44,621 --> 00:00:49,621
they have so many 130 545 pounders up
there that it's only an hour and half away

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,430
drive. Right. It only makes sense to
go up there and exchange knowledge.

17
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,720
So, you know, as soon as I saw him walk
out and started the fight, I was like,

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,050
I hope she just, he just shakes it off
and like gets into his, his groove.

19
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,650
Like when he fought dom like artwork,
that was, that was incredible.

20
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,950
He just let him come to him
and I was hoping that that was,

21
00:01:08,951 --> 00:01:13,490
what was his game plan? No
cause fucking man. So no,

22
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,300
he,

23
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,760
he wanted to use more wrestling from what
we were talking to Danny and all those

24
00:01:18,761 --> 00:01:21,430
guys about it. He wanted to use more
wrestling and definitely a lot of kicks.

25
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,040
He wanted to kick a little bit as well.

26
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:28,520
But he also wanted to just do the same
thing to what he did to dom, you know,

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,300
just kind of like piece of mobe.
And I mean considering the last fight,

28
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:34,900
he almost finish him in the first round
when they first fought, he was like,

29
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,850
I can, I can do this.
I can finish this guy.

30
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,830
Well I think he could finish
anybody. Yeah. But it's,

31
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,870
he's got to go about it the right way.

32
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,700
And I thought he was going about it
the right way initially with the kicks.

33
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,010
And I was like, look, even if
these are just landing on the arms,

34
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,440
like these are going to soften TJ up.
These are brutal.

35
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:55,770
He was throwing some brutal kicks it,
and it was a totally different thing.

36
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,190
He was,

37
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,520
he was adding a whole different aspect
to the fight that he did in the first

38
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:03,760
part. And it wasn't, it
wasn't, uh, it, it, it, it,

39
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,090
when he started throwing the kicks, I was
like, yeah, there's the game plan. I see,

40
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,600
I see what's going beautiful.

41
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:12,360
And then when he pointed to the ground and
he was like, yes, he couldn't touch me.

42
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:13,800
I'm like, oh, he's starting
to get in this rhythm.

43
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,300
But that's what I hate about immediate
rematches after knockout. It's just,

44
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:23,160
it's still in your head. It's just
the confidence level, the anger,

45
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:26,730
the emotion. Like, you know, Henry two,

46
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,470
three years between his fight with Dj,

47
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:32,370
where he got finished in the first round
or fights fighting some other people.

48
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,130
Uh, he was a different human. Absolutely.

49
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,130
But if he had fought
DJ the very next fight,

50
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,880
who knows how that goes,
right?

51
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,450
That would be hard to sell less.

52
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,920
Henry was the champion and
Dj took the crown from him.

53
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,560
This was the whole idea was that,
you know,

54
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,590
Cody had beat dom Cody was the champ
and that Cody was defending the honor of

55
00:02:55,471 --> 00:03:00,130
Alpha male and Tj was this snake in the
grass. They were gonna put away, you know,

56
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,790
that was the whole idea behind the
ultimate fighter. And it was just so,

57
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,930
I don't think there's ever been a fight
other than maybe Ronda and Meesha that

58
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:12,870
had more emotion, just more, you
know, bad blood by the rendezvous.

59
00:03:12,871 --> 00:03:14,780
Ameesha thing might've been worse.
It's,

60
00:03:14,781 --> 00:03:17,290
people don't remember how
hated Rhonda was after that.

61
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:20,110
Meesha Fike she wouldn't shake me.
She's hand like me.

62
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:22,810
She tried to shake your hand
and Ron was like, bitch could,

63
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:25,710
I didn't just walk away from
Marinette. And everyone's like, whoa.

64
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,760
Like why was interviewing her was just
blew the whole audience was booing those

65
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,800
emotional fights. They're so
compelling to watch, but man,

66
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:37,480
there are so fraught with peril for them.
