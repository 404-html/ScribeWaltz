1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,080
The joe rogan experience.
So there's very,

2
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:07,320
very few fake Jujitsu,
black belts,

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,680
but occasionally there are some and they
get outed and there's some hilarious

4
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:17,370
videos online. If guys go,
where is it? Where does Steven
Seagal fall in that line?

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,200
He is a legitimate I Quito black belt.
In fact,

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,360
he was an instructor,

7
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:29,180
one of the very first Americans to
teach at a Dojo in Japan. I know shit.

8
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,810
So Steven Seagal.

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,850
But the martial art is
the questionable thing.

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,580
It's the martial art of Ikea.
Edo Is,

11
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,990
it's really a martial art that was
created to disarm people with swords.

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,460
The idea was that you lost your sword
in combat and someone was coming at you

13
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:48,294
with a sword.

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,860
Last ditch effort is you had to be able
to use someone's momentum against them.

15
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,260
You gotta be able to use,
some guy comes at you with a sword.

16
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,610
You have to be very adept at catching
their arm and flipping them over.

17
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:04,290
Here's the golf. Very subtle,
right? Let's, let's not use
this because it's, it's,

18
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,630
it's easy to poke fun
at him when he's old,

19
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:08,160
but let's go to that black and white one.

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,970
You see that black and white one down
there. Go to that. If you go back,

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,520
see that one right there.
Steven Seagal. Go to that one.

22
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,410
Now there's some some footage of him
when he was young. Yeah, this is a go.

23
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:24,060
Fullscreen is legit.
He is very legit and he was thin.

24
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,490
It was a different thing like,

25
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,710
but the thing is nobody comes at you like
a fucking NCAA wrestler would shoot a

26
00:01:33,241 --> 00:01:37,860
double on him and take him down
faster than you can possibly imagine.

27
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:41,220
I mean this does not work.
It's a dance. Well it works.

28
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:43,531
It works.

29
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:46,980
If someone does know what they're
doing or if you have a lot of physical

30
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,930
attributes,
like the Gauls a huge guy.

31
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,670
He's a very big guy and he probably could
pull that off on a lot of people who

32
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:57,270
don't know how to fight. Yeah, I
hear this is what it was about.

33
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,170
What I keo was really about, this is
Kendo though. They're using swords,

34
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:03,150
which maybe they do use
some of that and Quito.

35
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,680
But what a kito was originally
created for, I hope I'm not mistaken,

36
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,990
was learning how to disarm like that.

37
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,110
The guy comes at him with a knife and he
flips the guy and takes the knife away.

38
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,570
He's using the guy's energy against them.

39
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,300
That was the original intention of Ikea,

40
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,240
but in terms of the Japanese martial arts,

41
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:26,010
I Keanu was never thought of as the most
effective judo is far more effective

42
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,280
because judo involves people grabbing
people and flipping them and slamming him

43
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:37,080
on the ground. Like there's a
great video of an old judo master.

44
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,270
See if you can find this video.
There's this guy,

45
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:44,130
he looks like he's about eight years old
and he weighs about 13 pounds and he is

46
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,490
lit. You can tell, especially
someone who knows martial arts,

47
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:50,340
you can tell when someone's just giving
in the problem with a lot of these

48
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,390
demonstrations of my kidos guys are just
giving in like this old dude watch this

49
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:55,224
old dude,

50
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,770
the old dude and the right hand side is
so much bigger than the other guy and

51
00:02:58,771 --> 00:03:02,200
they're the guy around and like
he's really throwing this guy right.

52
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,430
This is legit.

53
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,170
Like this guy's trying not to get thrown
and he doesn't know what to do when he

54
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,260
trips him to the ground there.
But this old guy is tiny,

55
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,580
but he's using perfect leverage
in perfect technique and fuck.

56
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:17,440
He looks really old in this picture.

57
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,460
Like the guy's trying to throw him there
and he can't pull it off and he can't

58
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:25,600
pull it off because the older guy
has perfect position and perfect.

59
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,870
What does the name of this
video? Perfect leverage, right?

60
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,120
Whoa.

61
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,240
Nine years old. Judo master is
the name of the video online.

62
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,840
And I don't know if he was really 90 but
he certainly looks like it could be 90

63
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,050
but this old guy just knows how to,

64
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,850
you notice also the back of his heels
are always like lifting up. He's moving,

65
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,090
but this guy's trying to
throw him and he's just,

66
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,090
and the guy who is trying to throw
him appears to be a black belt.

67
00:03:50,091 --> 00:03:52,730
At least he's wearing a black belt.
Fucking incredible men.

68
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,370
It's really amazing.

69
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,410
So judo was a much more effective martial
art and judo was actually what was

70
00:04:00,411 --> 00:04:03,080
taught to the Brazilians.
Um,

71
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:08,090
when count my ada went to Brazil and uh,
taught people,

72
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:13,160
um, in Brazil PR, particularly the
Gracies, they taught in Brazilian Jujitsu.

73
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,230
The Gracies took Brazil what was judo
at the time and they took the ground

74
00:04:18,231 --> 00:04:23,231
attacks of judo and just perfected them
and then hone them and changed them and

75
00:04:23,241 --> 00:04:28,241
made them more technical and really
worked on utilizing leverage and utilizing

76
00:04:28,941 --> 00:04:32,990
submissions. And they, they turned
that into Brazilian Jujitsu.

77
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,730
So Judah was standing as well
as ground? Yes. There's a,

78
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:38,660
a ground aspect of judo,
obviously,

79
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,810
like Ronda Rousey's probably one of the
most famous submission artists in the

80
00:04:41,811 --> 00:04:46,220
UFC. And her background was in judo. She
was a judo player and very good at judo.

81
00:04:46,221 --> 00:04:49,190
She was a bronze medalist.
So when she would get ahold of people,

82
00:04:49,191 --> 00:04:52,490
she would just fucking throw them on
their ass and flip them and toss him and

83
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:55,310
slammed him to the ground.
She just had phenomenal judo,

84
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,820
but also a wicked arm bar. And
that was because the Ne Waza, the,

85
00:04:59,821 --> 00:05:03,830
the ground attack version part
of Jujitsu, uh, comes from judo.

86
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,653
So there you go.

87
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,080
Yeah. My father did judo and he
taught it to me and my brother.

88
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,890
And then I remember my brother was bigger
than me and he used to flip the fuck

89
00:05:12,891 --> 00:05:16,250
out of me and then he did it to me one
day and my father grabbed him and flipped

90
00:05:16,251 --> 00:05:18,260
him down on the ground. He
was like, this is not good.

91
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,470
This is isn't like passing on.
No,

92
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,910
this is just a violent family attic
control. Who's his dad? Drunk.

93
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,290
He was six foot two six right
in his hand. A cigarette? Yeah.

94
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,570
Oh fuck yeah. Judo is legit. Judo
is way more legit than a kito.

95
00:05:35,571 --> 00:05:36,890
It's not an Ikea does not legit

96
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,640
I.
Quito is like,

97
00:05:38,641 --> 00:05:42,270
it's a lot of pressure points and
holding the wrist in different ways.

98
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,470
Yeah. Most of it is throws and
learning how to take an attack or look,

99
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:50,620
if you just charge forward and
an Akita guy and you have your,

100
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:54,970
your right hand come on like cocked and
ready. Just run out and throw that punch.

101
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,410
A really good a kito.

102
00:05:56,411 --> 00:05:58,940
I was going to grab that and flip you
and slammed me on the ground. Right.

103
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,780
But you know, how often does that
come up? Yeah. You know, most,

104
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,550
especially today when people actually
know how to fight, it's just a diff,

105
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,730
it's too limited. Yeah. But there's
a lot of martial arts like that.

106
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,580
Like there's certain aspects
of karate that are applicable,

107
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,470
but there's a lot of it
that's really limited.

108
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:25,460
Okay.
