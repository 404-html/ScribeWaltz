1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,080
Last thing. I was listening to his
buddy guy. Ah, those is alive and well,

2
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:06,600
but he guys, and there
was the album, he's a,

3
00:00:06,601 --> 00:00:09,040
I think about to turn 82
I'm going to go to Chicago,

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,660
put out a new album and just put that too.
And it's a bad ass album.

5
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:15,680
Of course it is. Oh, he rips
it the whole, he's amazing.

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,380
But that inspires me to still,
by the way,

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,650
everything about aging is about relevancy.
How are you contributing? Right?

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,450
Like George Carlin,
no one care,

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,030
the George Cardinal was doesn't matter
75 or whatever it was. That was a mentor.

10
00:00:29,031 --> 00:00:32,730
He's relevant.
That's what I aspire to.

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,860
Relevancy to contribute to
mankind, to my art, to everything.

12
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,530
So I'll never be like,
you know,

13
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,660
if someone says who's that old dude and
I'm not doing anything based on what I'm

14
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:48,750
aspiring to do, that's their
issue. Right, right. You know,

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,200
because I will be to my
best ability relevant.

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,840
That's an interesting perspective
because it's really true,

17
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:57,240
but it's something that people don't
think about. You know it's like,

18
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,900
like rock stars in particular,
like no one looks at Mick Jagger and go,

19
00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:03,690
why is that guy still doing it? Because
when you watch them do it, you're like,

20
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,520
oh Jesus, he's still doing it. He's
still doing it. He's like button. Yes.

21
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,960
Watching him live is ridiculous
by the way. He really moves.

22
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:17,340
No kidding around like
at the oldest 30 no,

23
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:19,050
he looks phenomenal.
He's ridiculous.

24
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:23,280
And he's 70 70 something still
shooting loads into hot models.

25
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,990
He had a baby recently. That's
my stage name by the way.
Yeah, yeah. That's my band.

26
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,080
How do you have that state
name? And that's my band's
name. I didn't license it,

27
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,500
so I'll give it back to you.
I have put my apologies.

28
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,410
Bruce Springsteen's another one
Springsteen's in his sixties by the way,

29
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:42,060
I saw that show. I saw that show
and I, my jaw was on the floor.

30
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:44,820
I could not believe that's Broadway shows,
Broadway show.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,720
It was one of the greatest things I've
ever seen before. He turns to Morrow,

32
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,350
Jesus Christ,
and he works out,

33
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:56,390
I believe twice a day,
every day. Does he really?

34
00:01:56,391 --> 00:02:00,220
He does yoga and he trains
with weights and all.

35
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,210
See if he could find Mick
Jagger shirtless. Uh, as ton.

36
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,020
Yeah. But I mean like recent, right.
Well then I would go to tools,

37
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:15,380
go to tools to the
right and then go to uh,

38
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,730
yeah, time. Yeah. There we go.

39
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,540
Say right recent.

40
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,710
See if he can find a recent one.

41
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,780
There's a lot of pictures
of him when his clothes off.

42
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:31,860
Jesus Christ make put a fucking shirt on.
But he a hot model.

43
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,270
A interesting man.
That's why I said to you,

44
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:40,770
there's always exceptions are far right.
What do you got there at the model?

45
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,630
Oh that's not Mick Jagger. You son of a
bitch. That's him at 40 with the beard.

46
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:49,530
I know that for sure. So that's
the oldest one I seen. Okay.

47
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,760
Well either way, the guy,
no, he's, he's really crazy.

48
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,810
What is movements or what's amazing?
His voice as not,

49
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,380
I think it's still amazing and
the way he moves. It's so fluid.

50
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:06,310
It's so beautiful. He does a lot of
yoga. I'm pretty sure Google is workout.

51
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:11,170
Mick Jagger's workout cause um,
he's incredibly disciplined apparently.

52
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,580
And then look up, uh, Barnaby
Jones reunion. Oh, just
out of curiosity. Common.

53
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:22,330
Look at him. Look at that right there.
Takes up yoga at 73. There you go. Oh,

54
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:25,870
is that what he did? Oh, I should.
Oh, it takes up aerial yoga,

55
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,710
I guess you're doing it on the ground.
Didn't work for him enough anymore.

56
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:34,060
Not Enough. And you had a ticket to a
new level. That's just ridiculous. Yeah.

57
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:38,380
Incredible. Mick Jagger at
Diet and exercise program.
Live long, long stay young.

58
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,630
What if he only eats peppers?
