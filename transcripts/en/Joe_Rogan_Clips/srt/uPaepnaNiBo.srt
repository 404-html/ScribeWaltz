1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,100
The joe rogan experience
her though.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,470
I think Jack Black was good and he's
got one of those Farrah Fawcett posters.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,490
Gut check. I just look something up
weird. It's not, it's sort of related.

4
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:12,660
The Jurassic world.

5
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:15,010
Did you see that movie when it came
out a couple of years ago? Yeah.

6
00:00:15,011 --> 00:00:18,730
It's the number three all time grossing.
Thank you.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,720
Hey Fuck the godfather. Chris Pratt.
If you want archery lessons legitimate.

8
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:27,840
It does. I bet he does
legitimate. You know,

9
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:31,950
did you see that in Instagram posted he
put up of is a sheep or a lamb that he

10
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:36,810
killed.
He had put a bolt to a ted and you know,

11
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:41,880
and chopped it all up, but people
freak the fuck out. You didn't see it.

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,660
Did Chris Pratt Scott some balls.

13
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,840
I saw him post a picture of a rub in
on a tree. Oh, he hunts and he said,

14
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:51,650
uh, said something about trolls. Yo,

15
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,970
what's up Chris Pratt here now the 2018.
What's that?

16
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,660
This is like a rap rapping that
sounded like this. The new album.

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,040
No, Pratt rap. He um,
he does though. Go down.

18
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,283
That's not it.

19
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,330
There's a video where he shows the
lamb that he's actually taken apart.

20
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,860
This is hill in the video it says it.

21
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,510
Okay.
When I ate it all.

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,280
Well, no, there's what I
meant. Their photographs.

23
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:30,600
She's actually photographs
of the butchered lamb and
people lost their fucking

24
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:32,280
Shit, man. That's, that's not it.

25
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,750
There's actually like photographs of the
meat and like there's a roast and the

26
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:38,930
roast is there. It is, right.
The one in the middle. Yeah,

27
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,950
and this one gets a legitimate,

28
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,350
I don't know if that's
necessarily this glory land.

29
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,430
They came from his assuming honestly,

30
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,450
sounds like it says,
look at all this glorious food.

31
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:54,480
We will eat off him for a month.

32
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,840
His wools becoming yarn as we speak.
He lived a very good life.

33
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,440
He was groomed and shorn
his hooves medicated.

34
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,170
He wormed and no antibiotics necessary,
surrounded by laughing and loving humans,

35
00:02:07,171 --> 00:02:10,550
including children to whom
they provided such joy nozzle,

36
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,670
pat and loved every day. No stressful
travel to his final destination.

37
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,660
Trauma free.

38
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:20,830
Just a touch of a u s d a certified
wan to his head and he goes to sleep.

39
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,790
The other sheep don't even notice.
It's like unplugging a TV.

40
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,610
Then Waka Waka, he's got a
butcher named Wacom. Wacom,

41
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,360
my Bush or Waka Flocka side job.
Then walkouts or wrapper.

42
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,580
It is definitely,
you're so white walking my white butcher,

43
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,410
we're not magic. You definitely want
right now the meat is for friends, family,

44
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:47,040
and gifts.

45
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,870
Soon though it may be available to my
followers as we test recipes and open up

46
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,080
to market. Oh my God. He's got
a murder animals for a living.

47
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:59,470
Got To get some things dialed in first,
including murder,

48
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,970
murder of sheep. Just kidding.
Like he is. I eat meat.

49
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,690
That's a glorious.
How get the balls in the sky.

50
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:14,710
When has a,
a list actor ever considered opening?

51
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:15,500
I agree.

52
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,500
A meat shop and showed a photo on his
Instagram of the honest procurement of

53
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:26,050
meat in an honest way. Did you see
that post I made today? No. W what?

54
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:26,710
Which one?

55
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,310
My, I have my airplane mode on so
I can't post it, but I think, um,

56
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,840
I made a post, uh, it was
a Google search that I did.

57
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,690
Okay.

58
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:41,680
There was 21 independent,
um,

59
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,790
legitimate scientists that found that if
you ate 50 grams of processed meat per

60
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:53,130
day,
your chance of cancer was 18% higher.

61
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,540
Holy Shit.

62
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:00,490
Just think of that number now is at
nitrites. What is it? What are the,

63
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,800
what are they thinking?
It's causing that, right.

64
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,550
Well, awesome. Yeah, that
part wasn't clearly defined,

65
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:10,160
but I would definitely think
it was preserved based, but

66
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,090
they don't really know though.
Right. They know it's processed meat.

67
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,320
It's really dangerous. Yeah. They
don't know what it is exactly.

68
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,540
But that's what's awesome
about how you and I hunt.

69
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:24,570
I posted it specifically to actually
some access backstraps from Hawaii last

70
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:29,110
year. Um, because I think,

71
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:35,100
I think it's maybe ignorant for people
to automatically make a post saying,

72
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,380
you know, you're a killer just because
you post a picture of, you know,

73
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:45,040
free range, organic meat that
you decided to choose a touch.

74
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,630
Um,

75
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,280
versus looking at it.
I know what you're saying,

76
00:04:48,281 --> 00:04:51,490
but you got to look at it
from their perspective. I do.
Even if they're not right.

77
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,290
And there's no right here. The thing is
there's there, right? And you're right,

78
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,530
it's everybody's right. That's, that's
really what's fucked up about it.

79
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,700
Like an animal does have to
die, you know, that is a fact.

80
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,600
And that does bother people,
including you and me when it happens.

81
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:11,170
If people don't realize that, but
that is true. They don't. But the,

82
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,870
the understanding at the end of the day
is that this is the cycle of life and

83
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:19,720
this is what life is really all about.
So they're right in your right,

84
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:22,240
but this whole,
this expression of outrage,

85
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,700
like you should be expressing that
at Burger King. You should be,

86
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:30,130
and not Burger King. Just, you
know, I'm not singling them out.

87
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,750
Anybody that has fast food, which
I've eaten many times. Yeah.

88
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,950
If you want to live in a
society of 20 million people,

89
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,700
you're going to have to live in a place
most likely with this model where you've

90
00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:43,300
got in and out Burger. And I like in and
out Burger. I like them. They taste good.

91
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,330
I go up there, we went there in
Vegas, they've got damn good. Right?

92
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,800
It's hard to beat.
So I don't necessarily hate those things,

93
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,870
but you have to understand what
all this really is. You know? It's,

94
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:59,000
the whole thing is crazy. You're
here for a very short period of time,

95
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:01,880
as are these animals,
all of us are trying to stay alive.

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,190
All of us are freaking out.
One of the things get eaten,

97
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,880
and we're all just going like, well, I
just want to be the best version of me.

98
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:11,540
I can be your right hand
there. Right? They just,

99
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,240
they haven't experienced what they,

100
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,000
they have decided that
an animal should not die.

101
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,790
There's no way an animal should
die so that they can live.

102
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,130
And if they can live that way,
that's their choice.

103
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,840
They're welcome to that choice.

104
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,780
They just don't understand
the merit of your choice.

105
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,580
[inaudible]

106
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:36,640
okay.
