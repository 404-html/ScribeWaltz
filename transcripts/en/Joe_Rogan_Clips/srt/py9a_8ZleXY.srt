1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,630
And, and as much as we're talking
about wrestling, he impressed me.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:09,280
Stand up. Oh yeah. He cracked
Condamine right hand. He, he,

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,810
he's, he stood up enough
to just say, you know,

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,540
I'm going to sit here and take a
few and I'm going to give a few.

5
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:19,680
But then he went to probably what his
game plan was, I would assume. Well,

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,980
you have to stand for a
little while because if you
just shoots it and he'll get

7
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:27,600
caught with a knee or caught with
a punch rushing in. But uh, he,

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,090
I mean,
he landed the bigger shot.

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,870
There was one big giant shot that was
landed in that fight and it was by hand

10
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,980
and Conner hit him with some pretty good
front kicks to the body and some other

11
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:40,170
things, but it didn't really
get much off on the feet,

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,200
not like classic left Jabs that just break
people down and on the ground he just

13
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:49,800
got mall. And it's one of those things
where you see that guy in the beginning,

14
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:52,950
guys fight him off a little
bit and then as the fight,

15
00:00:52,951 --> 00:00:57,690
whereas on he just gets more
and more dominant. They get
more and more exhausted.

16
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,750
Really. This fight just makes
ally Quinta look like a God.

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,690
I mean that's the most
impressive thing about it.

18
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:08,490
Ally Quinten went five rounds with him,
stood toe to toe with him and you know,

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,080
gave him at least a struggle.
At least he gave him a bit of adversity,

20
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,740
you know, managed to survive on the
ground much better than Conor did.

21
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,560
Manage to get back up to his feet,
manage this stuff.

22
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:24,060
A bunch of take downs and on the feet
was a real threat. You know what I mean?

23
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,930
Obviously could be, didn't prepare for
ally quintile. He prepared for Connor.

24
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,580
But ally acquainted didn't
even prepare for five rounds.

25
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:34,980
The only prepared for three.
So there was so much to that fight.

26
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,740
What do you think will
happen with Conner now?

27
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,260
I'm worried what happens with Khabib.
Yeah,

28
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,000
I hope they sit everybody down and
they'd go, look, everybody's all right.

29
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,893
Come on.

30
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,210
You know the guy who rushed in the
cage and punched Connor in the face,

31
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,780
that guy, that guy should be in
the most trouble cause you know,

32
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,890
the guy just fought four rounds. Got
The fuck beaten out of them. Got Choked.

33
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,330
I heard a lot of people,

34
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:05,890
there's a lot of silly non experts out
there saying that that wasn't a choke or

35
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:09,810
that wasn't a neck crank. They don't
know what the fuck they're talking about.

36
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:14,640
That that is absolutely a neck crank
when someone gets their arm around your

37
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:15,570
head like that.

38
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,630
And then what they do is they grab it
like this and they pinch the elbow.

39
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,780
They put the forearm
on his back like this.

40
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,430
So as the arm is across the neck and then
they grip it like this and the forearm

41
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:31,920
goes into the back and as
you're pulling like this,

42
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:35,790
you're pushing with your forum and
Yanking with your hand is a terrible neck

43
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:40,420
crank. Um, they call dean lister
actually has a video on it. It's,

44
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,640
he calls it the fulcrum
choke and it's a nasty choke.

45
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:49,260
So you know, I thought he was going
under the neck here. You can see it here.

46
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,450
Dean lister, who's a world champion,
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt and a,

47
00:02:54,451 --> 00:02:58,000
that's my friend Hans. Hans Molin camp
behind them and watch how he does it.

48
00:02:58,001 --> 00:02:59,150
See how he's,

49
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,920
he's grabbing a hold of it and what he's
going to do is he's going to clamp his

50
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:07,870
hands. Cle grips his hands, and so
it crushes. He's doing it like this.

51
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,510
No, no, no. You can go
right over your face.

52
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,870
He can go over your neck and go over
your face and go over your fucking

53
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,470
cheekbones. It doesn't matter. It
doesn't even have to go under the chin.

54
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,480
If it goes on the chin,
that's awesome,

55
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,340
but you see what's going on with
his forearm. See how he's put push,

56
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,250
pull into with his arms or you could
do it some. Some guys do it like this,

57
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:30,670
but I think this is probably the best
way to do it, but as you're right here,

58
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:35,560
this part just digs that elbow.
Yeah, perfect. Perfect example.

59
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:37,780
See he's pulling on it with his,

60
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,840
his right arm and then his left arm is
pushing down with his forearm on Connor

61
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:47,320
shoulder. It is a nasty,
nasty net crank and you, your,

62
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:49,750
your head is getting popped
off and first of all,

63
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:52,570
that guy could squeeze the shit
out of you. All you have to do.

64
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,970
There's a bunch of guys who
could put you to sleep like that.

65
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,160
Marcello Garcia is one.

66
00:03:57,161 --> 00:04:00,370
He puts guys a cease put guys to sleep
without even getting under the chin.

67
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:03,360
He just gets your head.
Just get your head in there and squeezes.

68
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,100
Eddie Bravo can do that too.
If he gets your head in there,

69
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:08,740
you don't even have to,
it doesn't even have to be under the chin.

70
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,490
He just really puts you to sleep
with your own fucking head.

71
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,820
Just wraps it around
your head and squeezes.

72
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:20,260
It's so tight that no blood is
getting to your brain. Yeah.

73
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:23,980
So there's a lot of armchair quarterbacks
out there saying that that was a neck

74
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:24,310
crank.

75
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:29,310
You are incorrect and a have deanlets
to do that shit to you and you will know

76
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,310
Jocko do that to me. My throat
is still, you don't want it.
