1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,430
And I could link it by the way to
marketing. So, uh, the dove that Eh,

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,510
and so on.
If I have wrinkly skin,

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,910
I'd like to believe that there is no such
thing as an universal beauty standards.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,340
And in that sense dove has been incredibly
successful because by peddling false

5
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:21,240
hope, they've actually been able to tap
into women's insecurities and incense.

6
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:22,200
That's good marketing.
Right?

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,230
Did you see the cover of Cosmopolitan
magazine that was widely criticized

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,730
because they had a morbidly
obese woman on who was, uh,

9
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,090
you a bikini plus size model? Yeah, yeah.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,290
And they were challenging beauty norms.

11
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:41,850
Like this is a person that's eating
themselves to death. You fucking assholes.

12
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:47,060
And so your lack of discipline and your
desire to shame people who exercise and

13
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:50,830
is what you're doing right,

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,900
to make them feel bad because you feel
bad that you can't put the fucking cook

15
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,930
cookies and cupcakes down as a lead you
to try to push this ridiculous standard.

16
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,290
And me and one of the things,
my point of view was,

17
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:09,120
could you imagine if the cover of men's
health had an enormous fat guy with his

18
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:13,470
gut hanging over his belt and people
were saying the new standards of

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,850
attractiveness for men have been changed
by Mike who just drinks beer and eat

20
00:01:17,851 --> 00:01:21,300
cake. You'd be like, get the fuck
Outta here. That's never going to fly.

21
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,590
It's not going to fly with men,

22
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:25,000
but it does fly with women
and by the way they go ahead.

23
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,340
The Fat Acceptance Movement
doesn't just argue that you know,

24
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,910
not being 500 pounds is unattractive
because of the patriarchy.

25
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,810
They actually argue that the medical
evidence suggesting that there is a link

26
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:41,250
between obesity and downstream
bad effects is all bullshit.

27
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,800
They not done,
not just that they there.

28
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:48,801
They also point to one incredibly flawed
study that has been widely disproven

29
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,950
that says that there's some sort of
vigor or vitality involved in being

30
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:57,360
overweight because they get sick less.
There's no,

31
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,460
no truth to that whatsoever.
They only,

32
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,810
they only analyze people who were healthy
at the time. Like it's, it's there's,

33
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,460
you can go and Google the study and find
out the, this criticism of that study,

34
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,640
but it's a hundred percent horseshit
folks being fat's not good for you.

35
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,340
It's really bad for you when you're
as big as that woman on the cover of

36
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:18,000
Cosmopolitan magazine.
She's literally morbidly obese.

37
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,080
She's fucking dying.
She's addicted to food in a horrible way.

38
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,370
And to promote that and pretend that
somehow or another, this is okay,

39
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:30,240
and we're gonna, we're going to show
new standards of beauty. You Go,

40
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:34,890
you giant gelatinous bag
of meat and tissue. No,

41
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,220
that's a dying person who's addicted to
food. She doesn't want to look like that.
