1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,610
Man, Jeff Bezos. Oh yeah. Jeff Bezos, man,

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,090
crazy is the national inquirer.
Allegedly we should say, allegedly,

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,230
I believe, allegedly, I don't wanna
get sued. Tried to extort him.

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,440
And it's about the Jamal because Shogi uh,

5
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:19,920
investigation from the Washington Post,
it's all connected to that. I read,

6
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,520
I read a bit about it.
Um,

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,960
I started reading more when Ronan Farrow
came out and claimed that they went to

8
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:29,040
him too.
So I'm not as versed like I haven't read,

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,590
I read through the ae they meaning
the inquiry inquiry I run and Pharaoh,

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:33,421
it was a store,

11
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:37,200
I think it was from the week where running
pharaoh says that they approached him

12
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:40,400
and, and you know, put pressure
on him as well. But you know,

13
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,600
the interesting thing is
when I read that story,

14
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:44,880
I kind of laughed because I was like,
member caulker yeah.

15
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,780
Remember when they public,
when they outdid Peter Teal
and then yes. You know, uh,

16
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,240
Hulk Hogan, like, you know,

17
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:54,000
these people were really brave to go up
against billionaires like this and try

18
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:56,460
and drag them. Yeah. I'll also point out,

19
00:00:56,461 --> 00:00:59,040
it's kind of scary that you live in a
world where billionaire can destroy your

20
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,720
company because they're angry at you.

21
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,240
But it's also kind of scary that they
can use this to extort him so that he

22
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:06,870
doesn't,

23
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,860
he takes the Washington Post or they're
attempting to get him to take the

24
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:15,210
Washington Post and remove a legitimate
news story about an actual murder.

25
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,380
I don't trust the Washington Post, but you
know, that's an aside that isn't aside.

26
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,500
Like if,
you know,

27
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,200
when I look at what the
national enquirer did,

28
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,600
it just reminds me of what the media does.

29
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,000
They know what they can do
and they know how to do it.

30
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,440
The media is influenced its power.
You know, uh, brands, they're scared,

31
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,483
they're scared.

32
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,100
So you look at what happens with some
of these Twitter accounts that will lead

33
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:42,600
campaigns where they encourage all their
followers to send emails. It's, it's,

34
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,840
it's not the same as blackmail
by no means, but when, you know,

35
00:01:45,841 --> 00:01:49,680
there's an attack vector, like, you know,
uh, what does that wild sardines company,

36
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,400
they don't want to deal with a brigade
from activists. You tweet at them,

37
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,280
you're fans tweet at them
and they immediately cancel
on your show and they just

38
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,250
value unless you do something,
unless you say something,

39
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:02,550
unless you disavow something,
you know. So granted, it's,

40
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:05,730
it's leaps and bounds worse when it, when,
when, uh, national inquirer allegedly,

41
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:10,440
you know, tries to extort Jeff Bezos.
The craziest thing about it is allegedly,

42
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,760
again, allegedly that the investigator,
I think his name is Becker,

43
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,010
was entertaining the possibility that a
government entity intercepted the texts,

44
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,010
the nude selfies from those.

45
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,200
But I did see another journalists
tweet that they're not entertaining,

46
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:27,900
that they're not pursuing it. It was
just a thought. So maybe it's not real.

47
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,720
What part of the thought was
that his girlfriend's brother,

48
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:31,770
who's a Trump supporter,

49
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,400
might have somehow or another
got screen grabs of her phone.

50
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,530
It was really interesting when Bezos said,

51
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,920
because he owns the post people per se,
uh, people presume he's their enemy,

52
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,040
you know,
and that's it.

53
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,880
That's another point I would bring up
to when it comes to like banning Alex

54
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,210
Jones.

55
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,820
Just because someone's reporting something
doesn't mean they're advocating for

56
00:02:47,821 --> 00:02:51,780
it. But sometimes they are. It's like
you got to understand the nuance in that,

57
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,250
you know, but I, yeah,

58
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:56,250
I mean Bayzos is probably not
the person you'd want to target.

59
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:59,170
I could you imagine what would happened
if Bayzos shut up at the Washington Post

60
00:02:59,171 --> 00:03:02,620
and said, guys, kill the story.
Every journalist which tweet it base,

61
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:05,770
I'll shut up and just killed our story.
Yeah. It's almost impossible. It's so,

62
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:10,330
so unrealistic. But maybe there's more
to it. I mean, yeah, the, the, the real,

63
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,740
the, uh, and this is the big
conspiracy theory was that, you know,

64
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,630
Trump always calls him Jeff
bozo. Right, right, right.

65
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,300
Someone from that side is involved
in this. Yeah. And you know,

66
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:25,660
cause Trump's always had this relationship
with the inquirer and big concern.

67
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:29,230
Yeah. Right, right. Yeah. So I don't,
I don't know, I guess I, you know,

68
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,960
this is relatively new
story and I've been here,

69
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,610
so I don't know as much about
it as I probably should,

70
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:37,510
which just shows you how crazy digital
media is and the digital things like

71
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:39,400
sending things through the air.

72
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:43,540
And it's just that people
can get intercepted.

73
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,260
That's why, you know, when
I, when I mentioned earlier
the potential for civil war,

74
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:48,940
like we don't know what it could
look like. This could be it,

75
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,270
it could be special interests using
information. It's the information war,

76
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,440
you know,
things that people have talked about.

77
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,080
I was thinking about this a
while ago. It's like, man, why?

78
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:59,260
Why did people shoot each other a hundred
years ago? I mean still do, but like,

79
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,880
you know, World War II,
why are they running it?

80
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,400
Because they wanted to gain control.
They wanted,

81
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:07,540
they wanted to centralize power or
they wanted to push an ideology or a

82
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,690
government or expand their power. You
don't need to shoot somebody to do that.

83
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,470
You just need to convince them you're
right or you need to get them to fight

84
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:16,990
each other. So I think
it's fair to say, yeah,

85
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:20,200
the Russians are absolutely screwing
with us, but we've learned through,

86
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:21,220
if you trust the reporting,

87
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:23,890
and it's hard to know what's real
or not that the Russian campaigns,

88
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:25,750
we're not only promoting Trump supporters,

89
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,680
but they were promoting black lives
matter. Why you give him to fight? Well,

90
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:31,540
they weren't just doing that.
There's a fantastic

91
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,670
podcasts at Sam Harris released
recently with a woman. Let me,

92
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,790
let me get her name so I
can see if you can find it.

93
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:42,960
Jamie called the information war.
That's the name of the podcast.

94
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,760
But uh,
they were,

95
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:49,790
they were doing all sorts of different
things like not just trying to Rene dear

96
00:04:53,571 --> 00:04:58,530
Resta the rest. And I'm working on getting
her down here soon. Um, that they were,

97
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:01,650
they also had like a Texas culture.

98
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,230
They had trans rights.
They have,

99
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,370
they even organize Facebook campaigns
where they had a pro Texas group and a pro

100
00:05:09,371 --> 00:05:12,900
Muslim group meet across the street
from each other. Yeah. I mean they're,

101
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:16,710
they're sowing seeds of descent,
like organizing it.

102
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:17,970
And I think I,

103
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,750
I'd be willing to entertain
the possibility that what
we call the culture war

104
00:05:20,751 --> 00:05:24,040
today was seated specifically by
special interests, potentially Russia.

105
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,230
Nothing we can do about it.
It's done. You know, when, when,

106
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,740
when people adopt an ideology,
you can't easily break that.

107
00:05:30,741 --> 00:05:33,260
And some people refuse to
cross that divide, you know?

108
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,770
Yeah. But it's just so funny how many
different ways they were attacking this.

109
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:40,370
They had a blue lives matter groups,
black lives matter groups,

110
00:05:40,371 --> 00:05:43,370
and they put people at odds with each
other and one of the big ones that they

111
00:05:43,371 --> 00:05:44,780
did was they,

112
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:49,880
they targeted African Americans and we're
trying to get them to vote for anyone

113
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:50,714
other than Hillary.

114
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:54,830
And this is like an engineered campaign
that Jill Stein's our vote and like we

115
00:05:54,831 --> 00:05:58,130
can't vote for Hillary. Like
Hillary not support us. We

116
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,360
can't vote for Hillary. And so it made it
very tribal. The first thing we have to,

117
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,200
we have to assume is that it was effective
in that what we view in the culture

118
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:10,480
war was exacerbated by these campaigns.
We don't know.

119
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,690
We don't know to what extent they had an
influence over the u s but I will say,

120
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,140
I think it's fair to point out they play
a role and then we can see what happens.

121
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,510
Charlottesville. Yeah. You know,

122
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:24,200
where we can see the dramatic escalation
where you end up with some crazy guy

123
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,670
associated with,
you know,

124
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:29,210
white nationalism ramming a car into
a bunch of protesters. It's, you know,

125
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:32,840
people get riled up to a point as a
really great video called this video will

126
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:34,740
make you angry by,
um,

127
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,200
CGP grey where he talks
about how these groups,

128
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,710
they argue amongst each other,
not against each other.

129
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,400
They make each other angry by posting
images of the other. You know,

130
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:49,160
there's certain subreddits why don't
want to, you know, start a brigade,

131
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:52,520
but they'll post memes nonstop
attacking a particular politician.

132
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,100
They're not arguing with
the left or the right.

133
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,400
They're arguing to themselves
about what's wrong with the other.

134
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,010
And so these groups grow
and get angrier and angrier.

135
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,800
And then when they finally meet in the
real world, you get extreme violence.

136
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,080
So it's very,

137
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:10,130
it's very possible to seed
those communities and rile
people up to push these

138
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:10,640
things.
