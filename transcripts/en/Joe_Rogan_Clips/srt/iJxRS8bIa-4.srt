1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,880
Her low freak bitches,

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,210
John Daly's character saying we're shows
a girl of the jerk and she hates it and,

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:12,270
and he breaks up with the cheerleader
at school because he hates the jerk.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,133
Good for him.

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,880
I had said with a girl in high school
where she hated a e t and I and I was a

6
00:00:17,881 --> 00:00:21,270
rough one to where it rough
and to survive back then. Yeah.

7
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:25,470
There's certain music and there's certain
movies that you're just not allowed to

8
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:29,330
like or hate. Yes. Yeah.
Well that's a funny thing.

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,420
My wife and I is, we violently
disagree on a lot of that stuff.

10
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:36,750
We don't have like one or two violently.
Yeah. There's, there's one or two,

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,130
like the main things that mean the most
to me in the world where my wife's like,

12
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,540
I can't, I can't, I don't like it at all.
And then stuff that she likes it, I go,

13
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,950
I hate that more than anything. I
think that's good. I think it's good,

14
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,840
especially with your spouse to have
like very few interests in common.

15
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,100
I think all those people
that do everything together,
a fucking Weirdos man.

16
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,730
They always freaked me out. That, that
is interesting. Yeah. Cause it's a,

17
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,470
it's like stand up. My wife, I met
her when I wasn't doing stand up.

18
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:10,170
I did stand up from the time
I was 17 until I was 24.

19
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,850
I met my wife when I was 28 or 29 so she
didn't know anything about staying up

20
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,910
till three years ago when I
started doing it again. Yeah.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,680
What caused you to do that?
I remember when you started coming around,

22
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:26,070
everybody was like, look at Judd and
he was doing, it's funny, I, I uh,

23
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,030
I, when I stopped when I was
24, I was pretty burnt out.

24
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,370
So that was 92 and I was
getting a lot of writing work.

25
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,750
The Ben Stiller show got picked up,

26
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:40,500
this sketch show we did for Fox and that
kept me busy and I was making, you know,

27
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,460
a lot of money compared to
the $500 a week I was making,

28
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,570
doing stand up on the
road. And I thought, well,

29
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:52,500
this is the universe saying you don't
need to do stand up and you should stop.

30
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,390
Maybe your friends are funnier than you.

31
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,580
And I'm living with Sandler and I'm
hanging out with opening up for Jim Carrey

32
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:01,560
and it's,
it's daunting.

33
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,980
It's like trying to start a band
and your friend is John Lennon.

34
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,080
He just feel like it would be
weird to not feel like a dick.

35
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,760
I was cocky with Jim Carrey and oh
yeah, the funnier than this guy. I mean,

36
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:19,030
I'm a sane human being. I know,
I know what's happening. Um,

37
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,470
and I was also a little bored of it
because I was so obsessed since I,

38
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,920
since I was 10 and you know,
I did funny people,

39
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:29,700
I did a little standup to write jokes
for funny people. So I was writing jokes,

40
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:31,200
but it was for Adam's character.

41
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:35,220
And then I started hanging out with Amy
Schumer working on train wreck and she

42
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:39,210
would come back from these tours
and I just got jealous. I thought,

43
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:43,380
that sounds like the most fun thing.
And then one night I said,

44
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,580
I'm going to go up tonight
just to make you laugh just to,

45
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:49,650
so you could see what it was
like when I did stand up.

46
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,130
And then I told a couple of stories I had
told on talk shows and I knew would go

47
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:56,790
okay. And Amy was very excited
hoping I was going to bomb.

48
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,800
Like she was thought this
would be this funny thing.

49
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:02,830
Judd bombs at the comedy cellar and I
did pretty good just cause it's stories I

50
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:06,460
know work. Okay. And then the
comedy cellar, he said, hey,

51
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:10,480
anytime you want to come back,
just pop in, we'll put you up now.

52
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,290
No one ever said that when I was a comic
because it was hard to get stage time.

53
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,400
And I thought, wait a second, I'm
getting treated like somebody who,

54
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:22,840
who gets to show up and go on stage.
I have to take advantage of this.

55
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,720
And I went on every night,
the entire shoe to train wreck.

56
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:27,280
No matter what time we finish shooting,

57
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:31,000
I would drive straight to the comedy
cellar. Wow. And I had the best time.

58
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,390
And then I came back to la and started
doing the Improv and the comedy store in

59
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:38,680
Largo and, and then I would put these
benefits together at Largo once a month.

60
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:43,150
And, and to me that was the most fun
because I could book a show and get like

61
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,890
channeling to come and
Randy Newman or you know,

62
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:50,740
Aziz and Fiona apple and we
did them all his benefits.

63
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:53,440
And I always like
producing things like that.

64
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,780
And then slowly my act got to the point
where I thought, oh, I'm, you know,

65
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,140
I deserve to be here. This isn't
some freak show. Well, you know,

66
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:05,500
as the difference between someone who
writes for television and movies and,

67
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:10,890
and the difference between that and a
lot of standups is when you're making a

68
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:13,980
living, writing and producing
and directing and doing all,

69
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,710
you're disciplined you right? Yes,
actually. Right. You have notes,

70
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:20,410
you have books you have like
you're opening up your binder,

71
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:23,530
you've going over your stuff.
So many comics don't do that.

72
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,460
I remember when I started,
I was opening for Larry Miller,

73
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:31,960
one of the legendary Comedians, and
he, he would have these incredible,

74
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:36,160
but some of them were like 10 minutes
long. He had a great bit about,

75
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,260
uh, about drinking. It's one of
the best standup bits of all time.

76
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:43,540
And he had a bit about
Thanksgiving and a skiing,

77
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,630
but they were all like 10 minutes and
they would get funnier and funnier.

78
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,290
And one day he said to me,
you know, this is a job.

79
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,200
You got to sit down every day.
They'd write jokes.

80
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,930
You don't just go to the mall
and watch a movie every day.

81
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,190
Like if you sat down for two hours at a
desk and treated this like it was a job

82
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:04,090
that deserves your respect, you'll be a
hundred times better than everybody else.

83
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,290
Yeah. And I did listen to his
advice at the time, but I do now,

84
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,540
like now I sit down,
let's try to write it up.

85
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,653
Okay.

86
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:20,520
Yeah.
