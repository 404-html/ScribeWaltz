1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,080
Dude, we had our two Thanksgiving's ago.
We had two hours at my sister's house.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,480
Yeah, I saw one last night
actually. Did you? Yeah. It
was pretty, no, not last night.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,150
Night before last.
It was pretty fucking cool.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,410
I pulled into the driveway and an owl
took off. Who was big too? It's gross.

5
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:17,880
I think owls, the meet the uh Oh,
you ate them, you saying? Yeah,

6
00:00:17,881 --> 00:00:20,610
but you guys eight hours.
Yeah, that's legal.

7
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:24,480
He's probably shouldn't say
that on a podcast. Well,

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,670
I didn't have a lot. We'll used to have
a joke about it and I didn't have a lot.

9
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:33,270
Man. I have no job. The guy even spit it
out. I'm not even joking. Yeah. Clinton,

10
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:36,060
when you smoked that weed and they had to,
they didn't have all the things.

11
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:39,090
They don't have a lot of meat on
him. It, I fucking know. Like owls.

12
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,260
They're predators. They're
important. Yeah. You don't
have rats everywhere. Yeah,

13
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:45,450
but how, you know they're,
I think they're violent.

14
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,710
Then they're dirty and they get this owls,
whoever did their PR,

15
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:53,640
you notice everything's, they're smart
and they can read and they're like, yeah,

16
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,130
they had a good PR, right? Yeah. Look
at that. We only got one up, Jim,

17
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,600
but see how much little meat is on
them. You think there's more? Look,

18
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,510
he's kidding. He's kidding folks. He's
not eating owls. The one in the middle,

19
00:01:07,511 --> 00:01:11,640
it looks like it's from another
planet, you know? Yeah. Yeah,

20
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:14,670
and that's what, that's what it really
looks like. That's what it looks like.

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,890
Fluff little alien raptor creature.
I was like a crab.

22
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:22,020
It looks like a crab.
I was driving home on one,

23
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:25,710
was flying above me on the
road and dropped a rabbit.

24
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,620
He had got a rabbit and jacked.

25
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,080
It was flying with the
rabbit and as he was flying,

26
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:35,580
just decided like maybe decided the car
was too close to him or it was too loud

27
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:37,740
or something like that. I just
dropped that rabbits it, fuck it.

28
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,490
And I stopped the car and to check it
out, I was like, whoa. That's flirt.

29
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:44,690
And really it sounds like
flirting LFL or dropping a rabbit.

30
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,330
It's your feet a bitch. It's
ready to fuck. Probably. Yeah,

31
00:01:48,331 --> 00:01:51,550
like an offering look like God for
you more with that. I can't, maybe

32
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,600
they're predators, man. We never
thought of him growing up as predators.

33
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,800
Yeah, they told us they
were wise. They had that,

34
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:08,010
that Monica like fucking
like Budd Friedman. Yeah.

35
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,190
You need the Improv. I remember
that. I like that. Planter's peanuts.
