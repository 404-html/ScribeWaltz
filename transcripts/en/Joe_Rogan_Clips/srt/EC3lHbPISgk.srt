1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
As part of that.
There's definitely something to that.

2
00:00:01,621 --> 00:00:06,090
And I think there's something to this
problem that human beings have, um,

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:06,960
where they,

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,430
they have an idea and that idea becomes
part of their identity and then they

5
00:00:11,431 --> 00:00:13,050
start arguing for that idea.

6
00:00:13,051 --> 00:00:18,051
And any argument against that idea is an
argument against them as a person cause

7
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:19,920
they're trying to win.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,300
They're not necessarily looking at
things in an objective way where they're

9
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:27,810
detached from the idea and
studying it as a thing.

10
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,750
Instead they're arguing to try to win.

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:36,000
And I think that is a giant
problem with ideas. Yes.

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,440
And it becomes even more of a
problem when it gets tribal,

13
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,390
when these ideas are attached,

14
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,690
like climate change clearly attached in
denial to the right in support to the

15
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:51,690
left.
It's this very strange tribal thing.

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,780
And that also happens with gender.

17
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,810
And it also like if you are in support
of of women's rights and you are a in

18
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:03,120
support of trans rights and
Lbgtq and all that jazz,

19
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,880
you're almost a hundred percent
going to be on the left.

20
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,480
It's just one of those tribal things.
If you're pro choice,

21
00:01:09,481 --> 00:01:12,360
you're almost always going to
be on the left. If you're not,

22
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:15,630
you find yourself in that. Which
one was it? Was it Tammy Lauren?

23
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:17,850
I get her confused with that.
Lauren southern girls.

24
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,700
Those girls are interchangeable in
some strange way. Those the, the,

25
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,760
the hot Republicans and Tomi Lahren,
Tomi Lahren, she's pro choice.

26
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,810
She got attacked. Can't be, can't
be. You want to be on this team.

27
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,060
You want to be on the,
the mean white girl team.

28
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,960
You can't be project you
gotta you gotta be prolife.

29
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,260
What about life but about the
babies support the bait. We,

30
00:01:40,261 --> 00:01:44,700
you know what I'm saying? I was like,
some ideas get locked into ideologies.

31
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:49,701
They get locked into these
tribal ideologies and gender
is most certainly one of

32
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:53,880
those people don't want to be
without a political home. Right.

33
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:56,640
That's a very good way of
putting it because if you do say,

34
00:01:56,641 --> 00:02:00,330
say someone like Tommy Tommy,
who is what our core Tammy,

35
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,530
cause I'm an asshole.
Oh, was she in trouble?

36
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,970
Tomi Lahren was star in
prolife film after the break.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,150
The blaze fired her for being pro choice.
What?

38
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,350
So if you're a pro choice conservative
or if you're a pro biology liberal,

39
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,600
you know, you kind of find
yourself in a weird in between.

40
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:22,470
So she's just fucking going the other way.
She's going the other way.

41
00:02:22,471 --> 00:02:25,050
She's going to start a film.
What's a pro life film?

42
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:30,300
It's like ABC after school special.
Don't have an abortion. Have you baby?

43
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,690
Yeah. Hmm. It's weird. Well
she's got to get her ground back.

44
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,340
Kicked off the team a little bit.

45
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:42,750
It's a bio pic on the Roe vs Wade
case starting Stacey Dash. Oh so,

46
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,500
so maybe she's playing a
bad person and that movie,

47
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,810
it just made it even more interesting.

48
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:57,210
Strange. I wonder how many of those
things are just distractions. You know,

49
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:02,190
it's so weird. People are
so weird with their, their,

50
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,770
their tribal identities, you know, I just,

51
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,420
and I love when they go back and forth
and shift from one side of the other.

52
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:14,680
I'd love it when like wow, former
conservative scene, the light or you know,

53
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:18,220
I used to be a liberal to the party,
lost me and I love that.

54
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:21,910
And then they go hardcore on the other
side is weird cause it's then everything

55
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:23,620
shifts is not just a couple of views.

56
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:27,190
It's everything in alignment with the
other side. How did you join the church?

57
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,470
Yup. Stop doing drugs. Yeah. It's
fascinating. It's fascinating.
