1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,650
What were the band? It's all, we all get
paid the same. Right? When I took idle,

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,180
Katrine started making some paper.
Get that paper.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,780
Fuck yeah. Is that what you're already
made fun of? Me and, but believe me,

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,570
did you do it just for the money?
No, but, but no. You know why I did.

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,480
Why? Because I thought nobody knew
who I was. Everybody knows this guy

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,150
singing. Nobody knew you
over. He knows this guy. Oh,

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,930
he was a human. My Mom's passed away
and she said, she said, you know,

8
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,110
they need to see that side of you.
You as a person,

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,390
but you just used an American idol
was the best way to show that.

10
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,960
I thought was the first
thing was what else was,

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,800
I had no managers back then that had
the good sense to offer me anything.

12
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,490
I got the offer from Marti Fredrickson.
I got, how long ago was this?

13
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:54,324
How long have you know?

14
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,930
200020101111 to 12 I get to sit next to
j Lo and Randy Jackson at motherfucker.

15
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,500
Beautiful Guy.
Jj Long J Lo's beautiful.

16
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,590
You know what us men need.

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,650
I think what everyone needs is a word
called incentive, right? Is it her ass?

18
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,240
It was her acid time. I'd look at
it all the time, but she'd say,

19
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:25,710
you're harassing me. And I'd say
who's ass her ass? Yeah, I know.

20
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:30,540
But the funniest fucking thing is we would
do all three of us and I think that's

21
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:34,460
missing now, but all
three of us, you know,

22
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,070
to do American idol,
you got to go to des Moines,

23
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:43,071
Iowa and in a gym and you're all set
up with a whole crew and you know,

24
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,350
three people with these microphones,
you know,

25
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:51,351
the 12 foot mics hanging down over your
head like this and 12 cameras and high

26
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:56,361
def up Europe was who and in 50 40
people a day would come through all these

27
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,780
1516 year old,
17 year old little trollops with you know,

28
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,260
red lipstick on and push
up Ra's and going to

29
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,680
get outta here. You know,
after the eight, after,

30
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,250
after the 30th 40th one you're sitting
there doing this. Right. You know,

31
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:19,010
so he just got to,
you got to do,

32
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,740
you need to have incentive from each
other and sometimes it would get,

33
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:27,420
so it was just shit burned out
after the 40th person, 50th person.

34
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,300
But that's what people liked though.
There's something about American idol.

35
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:33,780
We'd like really talented people, but
we also like people who are delusional.

36
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,630
Yeah. And we trust me. It took me about

37
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:43,170
two weeks to get into it because I told
myself I am never going to tell some

38
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:44,310
young girl that can't sing,

39
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,400
that she can't sit and get the fuck
out of here like that other guy.

40
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,580
You know what? I don't
like him. Yeah. Simon,

41
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,390
I don't like your music besides which
it's country and I don't like country.

42
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,260
I heard him say, yeah, that seems not
that super, but that's also foolish.

43
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,370
He's a weird case, isn't he? Because he's
not a singer. Well, you know what, he's,

44
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:07,600
whatever he is. I said, I'm
singer. How can I say that
to a girl? It's going to be,

45
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,330
there may be some days breastfeeding
her baby and wants to sing.

46
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:12,520
Maybe she wants to her baby's second.

47
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:16,220
She's sitting on her bed on
the bed and wants to sing.

48
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:19,480
But JLL told her she can't,
I didn't have it in me.

49
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,410
I'd rather like you shouldn't have it
in you. I mean that's his Shtick, right?

50
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,590
His shtick is to be a mean guy.
Yeah. And people liked that.

51
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,210
They liked that mean guy. They would,
they would say to me, you kind of,

52
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,980
come on man, take it up and let's
say that, that the producers,

53
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,620
they don't want the fuck they're doing.
They're the ones who uh,

54
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,530
they got me a couple of times ago.
Did they,

55
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,240
they got you to turn it up and then you
feel bad about it. Disingenuous. Well,

56
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:46,840
you know what I mean? Like there would be,

57
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,660
it would be moments where we were
parked. We're an, like I said, hey,

58
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:55,090
where are some Texas?
I look over and

59
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,720
the boom started going like this.
Right.

60
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,130
And I started getting it and they would
say, number one, cause it was in the shot,

61
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,840
you know, you know, and then so I would
whip out my a limerick, you know, those,

62
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,680
I go time for a limerick
and stop everybody.

63
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:15,490
Everyone was taught by say something like,
you know,

64
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,710
I want some metal horror from Dallas.
She used the dynamite stick for a Phallus.

65
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,290
They found her vagina in North Carolina,

66
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,770
in her asshole in Buckingham
Palace and the fucking,

67
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,180
you'd see the boom going like this.

68
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,640
The place would was just enough to
bring it up and we finished two more.

69
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,830
We leave. But it was fun like
that and it was a good pay day.

70
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,060
So when you're asking me to
have a house Somali, yeah.

71
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,160
And I was made fun of for doing that. Oh,
who made fun of you for doing that? Ah,

72
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,880
Joe Perry didn't think
it was a smart thing.

73
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:50,881
He said this one step under Ninja turtles
and he's my bro and I read that and I

74
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:55,480
thought I went, what the fuck
would he, Joe, keep in mind
when I'm alone by myself,

75
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:58,990
I went, does he write, when
do I thought to myself,

76
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,080
would Bob Dylan do this? Yeah.
I had those thoughts right.

77
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,330
Kind of fucked me up for a minute,
but then I went,

78
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:12,310
salt doesn't have a house on Maui does.
No, I didn't have one. Then what I wanted,

79
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:15,520
one, I got a house. He's like, how
much, much money that guy's got?

80
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,330
I'm sure you know, it's probably got a
house. So it took idol and I, you know,

81
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:20,270
I never,
I.
