1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,210
What keeps you up at night?

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:04,773
Yeah,

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,290
well it's quite hard to run companies.
Yeah. Especially car companies. How?

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:10,600
Say it was quite challenging.

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,680
The car business is the hardest
one of all the things you do. Yes,

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:18,250
because it's a consumer oriented
business as opposed to like space x and

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:23,320
not that space x. The space x
is no walk in the park, but,

8
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:28,840
but a car company, it's very
difficult to Kiva car company alive.

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,300
It's very difficult.
You know,

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,650
there's only two car companies in the
history of American car companies that

11
00:00:35,651 --> 00:00:39,850
haven't gone bankrupt and that's
Ford and Tesla. That's it.

12
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,030
Yeah. Ford road out.
That crazy storm. Huh?

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,090
They're the only ones by the skin of
their teeth. Shout out to the Mustang.

14
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,140
Okay.

15
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,320
Yeah. Yeah. By the skin of their
teeth. That is interesting.
Right? Same with Tesla.

16
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,170
We barely survived.
How close did you get to folding?

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,080
Okay,

18
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,600
very close.
We uh,

19
00:00:59,390 --> 00:00:59,730
okay.

20
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,890
Or 2008 is not a good
time to be a car company,

21
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:05,370
especially a startup called company
and especially in electric car company.

22
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,120
I was like stupidity squared and this is
when you had those cool roadsters with

23
00:01:10,121 --> 00:01:14,840
a tea towel with a target
top. Yeah, we had like a,

24
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,970
he was a highly modified Elise chassis.

25
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:20,340
The body was all completely
different by the way.

26
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:23,250
I was like Super Dom strategy
that we actually did.

27
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:25,570
Yeah.

28
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,940
It was based on two false premises.
Uh,

29
00:01:27,941 --> 00:01:31,470
one false premise was
that we'd be able to uh,

30
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,740
cheaply convert the Lotus Elise,
um,

31
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:38,910
and use that as a core platform and that
we will be able to use technology from

32
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:45,310
the store company called AC propulsion
for the electric drive train.

33
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,100
And the battery problem is,

34
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:49,740
yeah,

35
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,740
the AC proportion technology to not
work in production and we ended up using

36
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:57,930
none of it in longterm. None of
it. We have to redesign everything.

37
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,240
And then the,

38
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,350
once you add a battery pack and the
electric motor to the cart got heavier,

39
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:08,730
cut 30% heavier and validated the entire
structure, all the crash structure,

40
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:09,900
everything had to be redone.

41
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:11,450
Okay.

42
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,600
Nothing like that.

43
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,630
I think it had less than 7% of the
parts were common with any other device

44
00:02:17,631 --> 00:02:22,140
including cars or anything?
7% yes.

45
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,920
Everything including tires and wheels.
Bolts.

46
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:26,650
Okay.

47
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,750
Breaks even every year. And we'll
see. The steering wheel was,

48
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,430
I think the steering wheel was
almost the same. Yes. The, the, the,

49
00:02:36,431 --> 00:02:40,770
the windscreen windscreen, right? No, I
think the windscreen or is the same? Yes.

50
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:43,260
I think, I think we were able
to keep the led screen 7%.

51
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:45,840
So that's basically every
body panel was different.

52
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,680
The entire structure was different.
The uh,

53
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,350
w we couldn't use the h like the
HVAC system that the, you know,

54
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:55,530
the air conditioner was belt driven,
air conditioner off.

55
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,560
So now we needed something
that was electrically driven.

56
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,740
We need a new AC compressor and all
that takes away from the battery life as

57
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:09,130
well. Right? Yeah. We needed small,
highly efficient air conditioning system,

58
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,320
um, that fit in a tiny car and was
electrically powered, not belt driven.

59
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:19,390
Very difficult. How much do those
weigh those cars? The roadster,

60
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,490
I think it was about 2,700 pounds.

61
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,240
That's still very sound depending on
which version, 26 50 to 27 50 pounds,

62
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:28,150
something like that.
And what was the weight distribution?

63
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,050
It was about 50 well,
there were different versions of the car.

64
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,400
So is about 55 on the rear because we're,
we're,

65
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,270
we're bias but not bad like
considering like a nine 11,

66
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:45,550
which is like one of the most
popular sports cards of all time.

67
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,740
Heavy rear end bias. Well, I mean, yeah,

68
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,160
the nine 11 I think the joke is like the
[inaudible] despite Newton not being on

69
00:03:57,041 --> 00:04:00,640
their side. Yeah. If you're fighting
Newton, it's very difficult. Well,

70
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,420
it's like you've got this,
the moments of inertia on a,

71
00:04:03,421 --> 00:04:07,810
on a nine 11 don't make any sense.
They do. Once you understand them,

72
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,810
once you understood,
don't want to hang the engine off the ass.

73
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,530
This is not a wise move.
You don't want to let up on the gas.

74
00:04:14,531 --> 00:04:18,910
When you're in a corner, you're the
problem with, with, with uh, with,

75
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:22,240
with something that's where the engine
is mounted over the rear axle or off the

76
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:26,080
rear axle towards the rear is that you
pull a moment of inertia is fundamentally

77
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:28,750
screwed. You cannot solve
this. It's unsolvable.

78
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,880
You're swoon pull them over to
nurseries, you're screwed. Right?

79
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,490
Like essentially if you
spun the car like a top,

80
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,870
that's who Paul moment of inertia.
You're just,

81
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:45,890
I promised, I wouldn't swear on
this show by the way, really who? I,

82
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,700
so it was my friend.
Tell that friend to go fuck himself.

83
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,100
Who told you not to swear a fried,

84
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:56,790
a good friend of when I went to realize
your fucking Ilan Musk can do whatever

85
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:59,290
you want, man. If you ever get confused,

86
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:04,291
call me elsewhere and private swear up
a storm to say frickin it's fun way.

87
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:07,750
There's like old house moms,

88
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,770
wives that have children. Oh,
that's fricking thing. Yeah.

89
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,540
But anyway,
like the Porsche,

90
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:20,590
it's kind of incredible how well
Porsche handles given that, uh,

91
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,760
it's the physics moments of
Adair Scharf so messed up,

92
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,720
uh, to actually still make it
work well is, is incredible. Well,

93
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:31,750
if you know how to turn it into the corner
and once you get used to the feeling

94
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:35,590
of it, there's actual benefits to it.
You know, there, there are some benefits.

95
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:40,120
I enjoy. I, the car I had
before Tesla was a nine, 11,

96
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,430
nine, nine, seven or six
[inaudible] 97. Yeah. Yeah.

97
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,790
Um, great car man. Yeah.

98
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,730
I mean particularly what the on the porch
tower when they had the variable veins

99
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,020
turbo and yet doesn't have the
turbo lag. That was great. Yeah,

100
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,030
that was really great. The turbo
lag was, is like, you know,

101
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,780
your Florida like phone home,
call your mom, the older one,

102
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,340
but an hour later the car accelerates
and super dangerous too because in the

103
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,720
real wheel starts spinning. Yeah. Yeah.
There's something fun about it though.

104
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:15,830
Like feeling that rear weight
kicking around, you know, and again,

105
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,250
I could feel to it. Yeah,
I agree. But that's,

106
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:22,280
that's what I was talking about earlier
about that little car that I have,

107
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:26,690
that 93 nine 11 it's just
theirs. It's not fast. It's not,

108
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,160
it's not the best handling car,

109
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,110
but it's more satisfying than any other
car I have because it's so mechanical.

110
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,520
It's like everything about it like crack
holes and bumps and it gives you all

111
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:42,080
this feedback and I take it to the comedy
store because when I get there I feel

112
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:44,630
like my brain is just
popping and it's on fire.

113
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,190
It's like a strategy for me now that I,

114
00:06:47,191 --> 00:06:49,220
I really stopped driving other cars there.

115
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:53,710
I drive that car there just for
the brain juice. Just for the,

116
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,850
the inner,
the interaction.

117
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,280
I mean you should try model s p 100 day.
I'll go blow your mind.

118
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:05,510
[inaudible] skull. Okay. Yeah. Tell
me what to order. I'll order it.

119
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,310
One less p 100 d. Okay. Jamie,
what car that I drive? Okay. Okay.

120
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:14,340
I'll get with the car you drive. Okay.
It will blow your mind out of your skull.

121
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,130
I believe you. How far can
I drive? How far in miles?

122
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,880
That's good for la regular days.
You will never notice the battery.

123
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,020
Never.
Never.

124
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:28,850
How hard is it to get like one of them
crazy plugs installed in your house that

125
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:32,750
difficult? Now it's, it's super easy.
It's like, yeah, it's like a dryer plug.

126
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,920
It's like a dryer outlet.
