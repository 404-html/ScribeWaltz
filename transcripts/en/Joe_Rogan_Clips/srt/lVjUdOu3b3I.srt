Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,040
You know when I think it's one of the
things that I've been guilty of and I know

3
00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:08,830
a lot of other people have been guilty
of it too just to totally come clean.

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:14,080
I defend pot so much that I never look
at the potential negative consequences of

5
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:16,960
people doing pot if they're too young
because I didn't do it when I was down.

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,250
Army did a few times,

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:23,490
maybe like a handful of times before I
was 30 and then when I was 30 I met Eddie

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,480
Bravo. We started getting blazed all the
time and it changed the entire world.

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,450
Pot I smoked pot was 14 I'd, well I
definitely smoked it younger than that.

10
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:38,230
I smoked when I was eight
my Stepdad gave me someone.

11
00:00:38,231 --> 00:00:42,370
I was eight just to a puff cause I
was curious. I was like, what? What?

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,950
What happens when you do it? He
goes, do you want to try it? I said,

13
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,290
how much should I breathe? And he
goes, don't breeding in it a lot.

14
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:50,320
Just breathing a little bit.
This is obviously like sketchy memory.

15
00:00:50,321 --> 00:00:53,560
I did it once when I was eight and then
the next time I did I was probably like

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,800
14 and then I did it probably maybe again
when I was 14 when we cut school and

17
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:01,411
some of the kids,

18
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:04,740
a couple of kids that were the cool guys
that I kind of took a liking to me and

19
00:01:04,741 --> 00:01:07,770
I was like, cool, the cool kids like me,
I'm going to go hang out with these dudes.

20
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,000
They smoked weed and I remember I hit it
and very, and they were telling me like,

21
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,910
have you ever smoked weed or
no, I never spoke with her. I'm,

22
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,150
nothing might happen
to you the first time.

23
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,860
But I remember vividly hitting this
joint with these dudes and literally

24
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:24,720
spending probably an hour and 30 minutes
laughing my balls off that. Nothing.

25
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,650
And I thought it was the greatest
thing ever and from then on I was like,

26
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,790
I quit baseball.

27
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,320
No it pop Warner became an artist.

28
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,540
I started drawing and painting on walls.
I was like, I was a different person.

29
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:40,410
That changed my life.

30
00:01:40,411 --> 00:01:43,770
We eat is another thing that's
probably semi responsible for my path.

31
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:48,890
I had a very important moment when I was
16 I got only smoked weed a handful of

32
00:01:48,891 --> 00:01:50,480
times before I was 30 years old,

33
00:01:50,481 --> 00:01:55,481
like less than 12 like legitimately and
a one time when I was 16 it was me and

34
00:01:56,361 --> 00:02:00,490
my girlfriend and my best friend
who went over her house and uh,

35
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:05,530
I had stole some weed for my Stepdad and
we had rolled up a joint and we got so

36
00:02:07,881 --> 00:02:12,350
high we were teleporting. We would
like find ourselves in the kitchen,

37
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,830
astral cleaning type shall be staring at
each other on the couch and then all of

38
00:02:15,831 --> 00:02:18,500
a sudden we'd be in the backyard.
We were barbecued.

39
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,680
We were were fucking 16 I
think my girlfriend at the
time was 15 had Josh was my

40
00:02:24,441 --> 00:02:24,921
age,
he was,

41
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:29,900
he was 16 and we were just time traveling
all over the fucking building. It was,

42
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,410
we were way too high. That's
how I described the, for the,

43
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,940
the first and only time I ever smoked
dust. Oh Jesus. He did that. Well,

44
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:43,910
I hung out with like when I was one
of the neighbors as I moved into this.

45
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,680
Is there a fucky gateway drug
to dust as it's called Solos,

46
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,790
like Lowe's? Did they go right from
Diet Pepsi to dust? I don't know.

47
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,890
Here's my story is I moved onto this
street called Independence Avenue in,

48
00:02:58,891 --> 00:03:03,040
in the valley. It's like West valley
kind of Desoto Sherman Way Ish.

49
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:08,440
And it was heavily Latino neighborhood
and like we moved in and it was cool.

50
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,070
I mean like I lived here, I came friends
with a lot of people, but like, um,

51
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,170
I went from like the end of elementary
school into junior high right in that era.

52
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:18,550
So like once we hit the junior high,

53
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:21,010
it's like a lot of the domestic
in kids I was hanging around with,

54
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:23,800
started hanging out with you a little
bit older Mexican kids and a lot of them

55
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:27,780
were dealing in like kind of
gang life over there. Um, uh,

56
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,590
it's just part of the way they get down.
And then so,

57
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,710
and a lot of them like to fucking do dips,

58
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:37,270
which is like a fucking sherm cigarette
dipped into my fucking angel dust angel

59
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:41,560
dust. Sounds like healthy choice dude's
out. It's how I wound up with this,

60
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:44,200
this little tattoo right here.
First Tattoo I ever had in my life.

61
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:46,660
This little three dots.
Normally it's supposed to be up here,

62
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:50,090
but I wasn't in a gang. Oh. And
so it's like for some reason they,

63
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,210
I was so fucked up. This is
what wound up, I mean this,

64
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,370
this represents what they
call them a Mi Vida loca.

65
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,630
It's like little three dots here,

66
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,980
but it's like that happened because I
smoke dust because these dudes pass me the

67
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:01,760
sherm.
I didn't really know what I was looking.

68
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,170
I was like this bang and the literally
the way you just described that time

69
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:08,710
travel and it was like, I felt like
if I thought of something to do,

70
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,040
by the time I was finished with
the thought of thinking to do it,

71
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,050
I had already done it.
I'm going to call my mom goodbye mom.

72
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,850
That kind of thing.
It was like fucking nuts.

73
00:04:21,851 --> 00:04:25,480
I fucking never experienced anything like
that. I was terrified. I was terrified,

74
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,140
terrified. I didn't know what the fuck is
going on. It was almost like, you know,

75
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,720
it gave me a lot of feelings is if you
remember the first Friday movie when

76
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,110
Chris Tucker reflects on like somebody
snuck in a little piece of dust,

77
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,290
any fucking la. It's, I didn't
lose my mind naked, all that shit.

78
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:44,230
But I feel like I was the butt
of a joke that night. Like,

79
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:45,790
like somebody gave me some dust.
It was like,

80
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:48,590
let's watch fucking the white
boy fucking trip on dust on it.

81
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:55,490
But it made for a good story on Joe Rogan.
So, no, I'm, you know, we're either,

82
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:05,980
okay.
