1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:05,080
The joe rogan experience. Oh yeah,
a lot. Of course. Edge it bra.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,910
Also known as Eddie Bravo.
It's your pride.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,560
That's what they taught when we were
in Brazil. That's the calling me.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,760
Hey is Joe Moran?

5
00:00:12,761 --> 00:00:17,210
Were those the first giant tournament
that there was an la Joe Moran was,

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:21,940
he was the main promoter
and in my division that was
45 guys were all blue belts

7
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,580
in my division. He's, and you got
to sit there and listen to him.

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,880
Call out everyone's name and I'm sitting
there. I'm waiting for him to call.

9
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:30,250
My name is, he looks, he
looks at the clipboard.

10
00:00:30,251 --> 00:00:35,130
Then he looks up because here's your bra.
I'm standing right in front of him.

11
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:39,820
I'm like, man, when are they
going to call my dad? Like fuck.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,660
And then someone say, dude, I think he's
saying you're in hand. No Way. Yeah.

13
00:00:43,661 --> 00:00:46,840
Where's Rick Story?
Ben? It's a long story.

14
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:52,020
I [inaudible]

15
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,390
out of the park.
It was the weed

16
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,480
dive in
that ball landed in the bed of my cup

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,910
and he probably just went to Pete's.
Fantastic. He gets so worked up.

18
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,230
I was hoping you'd jump over
here and choke the shit out.

19
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,450
He loves conspiracy theories
about nine 11 inside. Y'All are,

20
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,470
I don't know man. Don't answer
that. You're already smart.

21
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,490
Get Eddie another beer down real quick.

22
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,270
Real quick. Chemtrails
yesterday, a killer or an aid?

23
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,740
How many, how many towers went
down on nine 11. Oh my God.

24
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,560
I know.
He knows my brothers crazy like you are.

25
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:54,340
Oh Shit. Donald Cerrone's that happy.
He knows the three towers went down.

26
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:58,330
Means that, uh, you know,
most people don't know.

27
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,230
They'll say to most people don't know
when that a press conference with Nist,

28
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,300
the National Institute of
Standards and technologies,

29
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,340
they're the ones that came out
and explained what happened.

30
00:02:06,341 --> 00:02:10,360
Tower some when they asked him why didn't,
did you guys check for a

31
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,510
really simple,

32
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,150
it's like kindergarten shit when
they asked the head of kindergarten,

33
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:18,490
why didn't you check for explosives?

34
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,860
Why didn't you test for
explosives on tower seven?

35
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,300
They said there was no reason to
witnesses.

36
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,360
Meanwhile, there's about an hour
of witnesses, firemen, policemen,

37
00:02:29,361 --> 00:02:30,710
sane bombs went off.

38
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,460
There's video of what's
going on and the guy said,

39
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:40,570
we didn't check for bombs
because there was no witness.

40
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,330
What about that frowning? Who
flew those planes? Exactly.

41
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:51,190
Nothing. Anybody can
say. I can say to you,

42
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:56,230
there's nothing I can say. I provide
a complete video evidence for you.

43
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,120
I broke it down for you.
You're still saying

44
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,460
how much I can say to me.
I hadn't said anything.

45
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,740
Let me play devil's advocate momentarily.

46
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,200
Some guy asked me the other day if I
wanted to have someone who's a lot,

47
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,280
a flat earth proponent is apparently the
best argue or for a flat or I want to

48
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:24,280
hear that argument. What could
they possibly say? No fucking way.

49
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,390
Either trolling or retard.
Yes, of course it's Trump,

50
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:32,170
but the one thing that's fucking
weird is you would think with all the

51
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:36,970
satellites we have going in and out of
our solar system and how come there's no

52
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:39,810
pictures of the earth and like,

53
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:50,650
Hey, I don't know. It's
a fact. I'm Brian Cord.

54
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:54,760
Meyer was one of the top
CIA guys back then. JFK.

55
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:59,730
This was Kay was banging cored wires wife.
So when you listen to this,

56
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,660
he Howard hunt concessional.

57
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,800
He said Lyndon B Johnson work a
straight at the whole thing. He lives.

58
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,550
He's telling you a CIA agent
famous on his deathbed saying,

59
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,720
you look at wait was cord
Meyer cord. Meyer wanted him
dead, so Lyndon B Johnson,

60
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,470
he had cord. Meyer did look
how much at the time was that?

61
00:04:16,471 --> 00:04:20,010
He Bravo spent smoking weed, peering
out curtain senior first play that.

62
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,940
Are you shocked or something? Dude.
Now people are dying all the time.

63
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,540
Did you know this is some wide open?
She did.

64
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:33,541
You know how many astronauts died in 1968
to eight and then two more in 69 what

65
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:38,980
happened when they doing flying
in this space? Accidents.

66
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,660
His Father Prescott Bush started the CIA.
His father,

67
00:04:43,661 --> 00:04:47,470
Prescott Bush finance the
Nazis through union bank.

68
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,140
That's not a conspiracy theory that

69
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,280
you know in Sweden for many years
they sterilize kids that didn't have

70
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,390
symmetric, perfectly symmetrical faces.
Is that a fact? It's actually nice.

71
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,800
That's why they're so good looking
because they stay. I don't know.

72
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:10,060
I'll look into it. You think you
think that's crazy? When, when?

73
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:14,500
When when you say look into it, did you
look into it? I got to meet her now.

74
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:19,330
Everything that's coming through the
major news that works all have an agenda

75
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:23,380
behind it. Whether it's district,
because if I was running shit I would,

76
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,410
if I was running shit and they said, hey,
what do you think we should do? I'm like,

77
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,940
wait a minute. Are you guys controlling
the media? First of all, if they say no,

78
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:33,160
we're not really controlling the media.
They do whatever they want.

79
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,880
I would say control the goddamn media.
What the fuck are you guys,

80
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,300
how would I get my information
at the library guys?

81
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:43,180
I go to the library as apple bottom.
I'm so fucking Internet.

82
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,490
Who goes to the library?
The library.

83
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,540
You guys get your information from
the Internet. I go to the library.

84
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,770
How I love how you say the Internet
is if it's all the same source he did.

85
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:58,490
He was in this amazing documentary and
just a fucking changing documentary

86
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,770
called the principal. Have
you seen that? No, I have not.

87
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:05,750
Fuck Emmett Chicago's in at a bunch of
physicists, like professors from Mit.

88
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:10,370
That's so funny. I just saw
the documentary sugarcoated,
Dan. Have you seen it?

89
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,880
It's terrifying. Holy Shit.
Real quick documentary. This is,

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,940
this is one that I've watched over
and over. It's really, really good.

91
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,450
You said it's the festival. No,
it's not. It's not, but it's really,

92
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:23,220
really good because especially
for conspiracy, there is type,

93
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,850
it's called how big oil
conquered the world.

94
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,670
There's a documentary called the
fence will blow your fucking mind.

95
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,520
They never finished that. They
abandoned it. It's deserted.

96
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,860
Mexican dudes are going,
what are these Americans doing?

97
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,560
They're interviewing Mexicans.
I'm just like, this is easy.

98
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:41,770
This documentary's called about the birth
of oil and how it came in and infected

99
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,640
all our lives and how John Rockefeller
monopolize fucking everything to find

100
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:49,830
that dude. It's an incredibly,
and it's free on youtube. Yeah.

101
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,510
That's a big red flag there. Hey, there's
a documentary you can watch on Youtube.

102
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,460
Oh, Jay, the untold story.

103
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,790
Untold Story. Oh No,
it's at the library, Bro.

104
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,240
In America.
The Sugar Association,

105
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,220
they didn't want it to be labeled
as for what it really was, uh, uh,

106
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:15,680
an addictive toxin.
They wanted to keep it.

107
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,790
It ain't that bad in moderation and ain't
that bad. It makes things taste sweet.

108
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,250
It's about love.
They tell you,

109
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,030
they tell you lead on no shit.

110
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,300
We're looking at a bunch of
lights and the Goddamn sky.

111
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,490
You're going to tell me that that light
and that light that's 200 and 5,000

112
00:07:34,491 --> 00:07:38,210
trillion light years away.
How the fuck did you figure that out?

113
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,630
And you don't have an explanation
for that shit. No, exactly.

114
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:43,500
That's what every would
you just send it right now?

115
00:07:43,501 --> 00:07:46,490
But what you just said now is
what everyone's natural reaction.

116
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,400
Cause anytime someone
says anything about space,

117
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,780
you automatically think
someone figured it out.

118
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,870
You don't know the guy's name.
You don't know the name of the experiment.

119
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,520
You didn't look into it yourself.

120
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:02,420
You just think when someone tells you
how far is the earth from the sun?

121
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:06,860
Oh say oh 93 million miles away.
Like you just,

122
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,090
you.

123
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:13,090
Everybody relies on someone figured
that out and someone double checked it.

124
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:19,490
Dude, it's math. It's science. It's
math. But no one really knows. So they,

125
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:23,360
they paid according to this documentary,
they paid out Harvey. You know,

126
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:25,640
cause everyone's like, I'm
science, I'm a science. This,

127
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:28,910
I'm science that it's beautiful when
people do that because then all you do is

128
00:08:28,911 --> 00:08:32,150
buy off all the scientists and you got
everybody. I love some sugar though, man.

129
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:36,650
We can all be bullshit.
Those documentaries key
so juiced up. They're so,

130
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,950
they're so juicy. They seem
so good. They seem so real.

131
00:08:39,951 --> 00:08:43,970
You get fired up and then once you get
fired up, it's tough to get unfired up.

132
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:49,020
I want to be in the Goddamn Illuminati.
If they'd got down and listening. Yeah,

133
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,090
that's the wrong,

134
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,060
except the military credit for all the
great music that came out of the 60s you

135
00:08:57,061 --> 00:09:00,900
fucking military scenario.
You are a fucking just shit

136
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,650
to start my own false flowers.
Jones,

137
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:08,310
he's get a call you a shell Monday morning
we got an disturbing turn of events.

138
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,430
Eddie Bravo I've had on this podcast.

139
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,170
I did not know he was in an
Illuminati Shit. Fuck yeah,

140
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:19,260
he is on the Joe Rogan
experience. Yes. Yeah.

141
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:23,970
Trails proven to be false. Fuck yeah.
Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah. I want to fucking,

142
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,380
oh my God, you're in. If, oh, please let
me, let me work through my own fault.

143
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,660
I talked about this, the phone, I would,

144
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:35,340
if I would get that fucking oil from
Alaska, I would go in there and make it,

145
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,310
make it an elect. Trump make it
look like the Isis is, uh, uh,

146
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,670
Eskimos are trained in
Isis. I would, you know,

147
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:47,850
you're a national treasure and
[inaudible] was a national trend.

148
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,680
Now these things are true.
It has to be frustrating.

149
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:52,170
Ready to believe something go.
He's constantly have to back.

150
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,650
Here's a sauce and this is very exhausted.

151
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,390
When I posted a meme,
I can see like people,

152
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,960
I could see my, uh, followers
rise. But what I post,

153
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,910
anything like anti vaccine,
any kind of dude,

154
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,830
hundreds,
70,

155
00:10:13,831 --> 00:10:15,930
2000.8 and then it goes,
well,

156
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:20,931
it's 7.6 reach to,

157
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:24,650
they want, people don't like
conspiracy. I know so many.

158
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,850
I lost. You know what? I
cleaned them out. It's a filter.

159
00:10:32,851 --> 00:10:37,050
I needed to clean those fuckers out.
Someone did come up to me and say, Hey,

160
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,190
have you heard that conspiracy
theory where there's no forests,

161
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:47,250
there's a conspiracy theory where
there's no chorus. Look into it.

162
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,840
No forest, you love these things. I'm
like, I don't know what that is. Really.

163
00:10:51,841 --> 00:10:52,410
I didn't even look,

164
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,250
I watched 30 seconds cause someone
that had an in class told me, right.

165
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,970
A Ziggy came across your, that
conspiracy theory about Noah. I go, Whoa,

166
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,800
what is that? When all of that, but
no forest, and I was 13 seconds.

167
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,660
I used to stopped it.
Have you seen the one with this?

168
00:11:08,661 --> 00:11:12,930
The due to the dinosaurs aren't real.
Have you seen that one that I don't have?

169
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:17,660
I don't know. I don't know. That's like
some other shit where I'm like, I don't,

170
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,120
I don't believe any science.
I don't believe in the only science.

171
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:22,440
I believe that is a,

172
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,220
you rub two sticks together and there's
fire that's other than that science,

173
00:11:26,221 --> 00:11:27,950
you've got to prove that.
It's just like a boy scout.

174
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,170
I'm going to ignore that shit. Hmm. Oh,

175
00:11:31,171 --> 00:11:34,820
you gotta just tobacco science. What
about that, that you think that Shit gone?

176
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:44,540
Yeah.
