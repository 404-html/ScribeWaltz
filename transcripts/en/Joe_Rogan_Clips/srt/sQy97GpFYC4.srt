1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,820
But I remember when,
uh,

2
00:00:01,821 --> 00:00:06,240
I'm old enough to remember when Cassius
clay beat Sonny Liston. Beat him twice.

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:07,650
He was like eight to one.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,660
That was another fight where a lot
of people thought it was fixed.

5
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:11,430
The second fight in the
second one in Lewiston,

6
00:00:11,431 --> 00:00:15,930
Maine and hidden punch well was a,
you could see the punch is said.

7
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:20,040
They said to call it a phantom punch. You
could see the punch, but it was like a,

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,360
he called it an anchor punch cause it's
like as listing was coming forward,

9
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:26,490
he dropped it down on him like that.

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,460
And a lot of people say it didn't
land but you could see his head react.

11
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:30,450
It definitely landed.

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,260
The question was whether or not he
decided to stay down once he got hit.

13
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,890
I think he did. If you watch
it just doesn't look realistic.

14
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,050
I can be watched when he goes down the
way he went down seeing maybe legit,

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,110
but the way stumbled around it.

16
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,270
He didn't stumble around like a guy who
was central nervous system got jacked

17
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:51,810
here. We were watching right
here, sixth grade. Lucy,

18
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:56,610
you got best watch this. I'll get
this pink. See that's a real punch.

19
00:00:56,611 --> 00:01:01,380
100% and the Dra, the him dropping is
real too. There's no doubt about it.

20
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,730
The question was whether that was enough
to take them out. Look at that bank.

21
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,140
It could have, but watch the case. See
if you can find the knockout Jamie,

22
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:11,790
because the what's not,

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,380
what's crazy about it wasn't him dropping
him cause I think that was legit.

24
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:21,410
What's crazy was how afterwards he
stumbled around like he couldn't move.

25
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:25,650
Like he couldn't get up. It just didn't
seem real. What did, we just had it there.

26
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,280
Long explanation. I don't know if
they're going to show the actual thing.

27
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:33,780
Well they just showed him trying to get
up. That kind of looks like Kevin Spacey.

28
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:40,080
Oh zero wow, here it is.
Here it is. Play, watch.

29
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,090
Here's the punch. Boom. Now Watch.

30
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,270
He goes down and he just sort of laid
down on his back and then he kind of

31
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:50,970
stumbled around and acted
like he couldn't get up.

32
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,710
They just keep showing it over and over
again. It was 100% of legitimate punch.

33
00:01:54,711 --> 00:01:56,100
And people who say it's not,

34
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,910
they've never seen people get kol cause
people get Kol and all sorts of weird

35
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,890
ways.
It doesn't really make sense.

36
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,450
Like it's a human being getting punched
in the face. Weird Shit happens.

37
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,290
Especially you get punched
on the jaw. Like, see,

38
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,510
people get touched with like a jab.

39
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:16,350
Sometimes when they go out it
doesn't make sense. And it also,

40
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:20,590
sometimes here it is, it's
right here. It's also sometimes
it's weird because, uh,

41
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,100
you might've gotten hurt
real bad and training.

42
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,300
So a lot of guys come into these
fights and they're already injured.

43
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,810
They just boom right there.
Now let's watch them stumble around.

44
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,270
So he goes down and he
lays down on his back. See,

45
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,290
this is where I'm not buying it.
This, he just seems like Horse Shit,

46
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,000
but I could be wrong. Now he's
stumbling. See like right there,

47
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,590
that seemed like he decided to stumble
and go down and he's trying to get back

48
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:51,240
up. I could be wrong, I could
be wrong, but I'm not buying it.

49
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,040
And so, uh, the referee was
jersey, Joe Walcott, who's wow.

50
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,780
A very famous champion. His own now.

51
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:05,560
They stopped, they stopped the fight.
I don't know. I don't remember.

52
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,890
I don't remember the first fight.
Fifth Round,

53
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,400
I think it was listing,

54
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,950
put some white stuff on
his clubs and he blinded.

55
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,330
This is how crooked the game was
he playing? Did Ali Cassius Clay?

56
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,110
So listen, wasn't above,
you know, cheating.
