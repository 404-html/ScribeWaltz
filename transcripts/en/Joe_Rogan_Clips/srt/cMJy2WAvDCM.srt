1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,750
Her low freak bitches.
Is He,

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,150
what is he like when the lights are off?

3
00:00:06,151 --> 00:00:10,370
I wish I could have a fucking a feed of
Trump's brain when the lights go down,

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,780
that's probably CIOs. What
is he thinking? Is he like,

5
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:16,650
I'm killing it or is he like, what have
I done? I think there's gotta be both.

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,850
Yeah. Or there he's gotta be, uh, well
he doesn't drink and he doesn't do drugs.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,510
Right. And I think there's gotta be a
part of his brain that's pushing down the,

8
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:28,830
what have I done and it reinforcing,
doubling down on the,

9
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:31,320
I'm the greatest. I'm the best. I mean,

10
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:34,080
that's why I kept saying about
his inauguration numbers.

11
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:35,460
There's so many people were there.

12
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:39,090
And even when they told him that
it wasn't the case, he fought it.

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,660
Then when he kept parroting,
not just parenting to friends,

14
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,390
but doing it to the news,
doing it to the press,

15
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:50,370
that he got the largest number of
electoral college votes. That's crazy.

16
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,810
It's psychedelic narcissism.
It's like, it's so far out there.

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,540
It starts to seem like,
Whoa,

18
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:00,930
you're bending reality and actually
is bending reality. He's done.

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,200
He's done a fascinating job of just
making people not know what's real anymore

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,260
and no one knows what's real anymore and
Syria as the ultimate example because

21
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,050
it's unclear what Israel,
they're like,

22
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,440
no one knows what the right thing to
do is. Who are we attacking and why?

23
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:17,490
What are we trying to stop?

24
00:01:17,491 --> 00:01:21,510
You sent bombs to the people that are
fighting isis to fight those people from

25
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:23,370
doing chemical warfare
on their own people,

26
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:26,910
but then we also are fighting isis with
them and then it's just the whole thing.

27
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:28,600
You're just like, I
give up. You will have,

28
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,280
when Ron Paul was saying that the
chemical attack doesn't make sense,

29
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:37,200
so certain Soton Republicans are actually
looking at me as Ron Paul Tech and the

30
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,090
Republicans more
libertarian than anything,

31
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,230
but they're looking at it and saying
like this, this might not even been real.

32
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,420
I mean, I just, well,

33
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:48,660
I heard this great thing about how no
one in Israel believes that Rabin was

34
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:53,340
killed by Yigal Amir, the Jewish guy
like that. They, they believe in that.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,290
Basically hearing a conspiracy theory
that widely believed in a country that

36
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,320
isn't my own made me realize how wildly
desperate for conspiracy theory everyone

37
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:07,230
is. Right? It like somehow the distance
where it was like, oh it's Israel.

38
00:02:07,231 --> 00:02:10,350
It's not really me. Made me go
like, oh this is so interesting.

39
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:14,550
Like everybody wants to believe it wasn't
one hour until they were saying that

40
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,190
the chemical attack by Assad was not real.

41
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:21,150
Even though Assad has done
gas based chemical tests on
his own people before and

42
00:02:21,151 --> 00:02:25,890
his father did before him. Somehow this
one was like, no, no, this is fake.

43
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,610
It might be fake. That's what's so crazy
and mind bending. It might be fake.

44
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,870
And yet I don't buy any
conspiracy theories anymore
cause I knew how desperate

45
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:34,704
people are to believe them.

46
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,830
Well this was the same scenario that led
Obama to make that speech saying that

47
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:44,130
we need to go into Syria and the
whole American people went fuck that.

48
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,900
Cause we were deep in the Iraq war,

49
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:48,870
deepen the Afghanistan war
and that was when this,

50
00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:53,871
I think that was 2013 or
14 but Trump made quotes.

51
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,890
It's crazy that he tweeted like,

52
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:59,130
what does a u s have to
gain for going into Syria?

53
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:04,140
We should be America first and then
winds up acting almost instantaneously.

54
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,950
Yeah, I know. It happens. People keep
dropping these, like you said, this, yeah.

55
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,400
Bombs at Trump's feet. Like he cares
about intellectual coherence or hypocrisy.

56
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,650
He doesn't care.
He's a fucking rat trapped.

57
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,550
He's trapped in a corner of amaze and he's
going like, what the fuck do I do? Oh,

58
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:23,110
I'll just do this. It's so, it's so
transparent. Like 35% approval rating.

59
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,750
Everything is, you're, you're
collapsing under your own weight.

60
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:28,150
You have the house and the Senate
and you can't get anything done.

61
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,730
No one likes you. You're the
worst. So what do you do?

62
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,580
You fucking make something explode.

63
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,810
It's just such a terrible recipe of
something actually goes wrong. Oh yeah.

64
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:42,230
Like Syria is a minor issue.
No one died. Totally bomb.

65
00:03:42,231 --> 00:03:46,330
Some airfields, they ruined some,
you know, some ground, I agree.

66
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,360
Ruin some air ships. Um, some, uh, planes.

67
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,360
But what happens if something
really goes down and that guy is,

68
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,560
that is the figurehead.

69
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:58,710
That is the difference between the
Roman Empire and this empire is that the

70
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,500
Roman Empire didn't have the power
to press a button and destroy,

71
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:06,760
like path the countries on earth.
And we do. So that's the scary part.

72
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,600
Oh, come to the comedy
store. The Saturday night.

73
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:23,500
Yeah.
