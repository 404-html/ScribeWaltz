1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:04,530
Really, cause he was talking about,
we ended up getting off on this whole,

2
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:08,180
I don't know how we got
there, but we started off on
this whole tangent about uh,

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,320
about just, you know, sobriety and
stuff and he's like, man, you know,

4
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:17,550
back in my day, and he was, I
can't remember the exact dialogue,

5
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:22,050
but it was just, yeah, I mean those
guys were all, it was all just a blur.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,700
I learned something from Argus.

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,310
Argus runs like insane numbers of
miles every day, like 12 miles,

8
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:30,600
15 miles a day.

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,300
The addict in him, the guy that loved
getting wasted, that's his high now.

10
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:37,310
He talks about it all the time.
It's runner's high.

11
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,650
It's real. Yeah. It's real. I
know now because of this month,

12
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,900
this month, the sober October month, dude,

13
00:00:43,901 --> 00:00:47,350
I worked out no less
than at least two hours.

14
00:00:47,351 --> 00:00:49,810
That's a small workout.
A small workout.

15
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:53,110
Well that's all I could get in
was two hours. The longest I did.

16
00:00:53,111 --> 00:00:57,910
I did six hours one day. Good
Lord. Six hours of insane cardio.

17
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,370
It's like both kill bills.
I did seven.

18
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,360
I did seven hours of cardio in the last
two days between yesterday and the day

19
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,620
before. Seven hours of hard
cardio, different stuff,
running the hills with a dog.

20
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:09,840
Lipstick.

21
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,210
What are your own heating
with fat people, right? Yeah.

22
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,640
No, I'm competing with myself. First of
all, my main competition is Ari Shaffir.

23
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,120
And whether you realize
it or not, Arusha, fear,

24
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,910
even though he doesn't exercise
are he has a strong mind.

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,040
He's a very strong mind. Ari Ran
15 miles the other day, 15 miles.

26
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,450
He rode five kilometers and then
after he wrote five kilometers,

27
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:36,510
he um, he did something
else. He rode his bike.

28
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,000
He rode a bike for a certain amount of
miles. How long did it take him to run?

29
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:43,020
15 miles. The whole thing. His whole
workout was, I think four hours.

30
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,380
Good.

31
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,120
He's got that power Jew gene.

32
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,080
He's got that escape from
concentration camp Jean Dude,

33
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,680
he's, he's, you saw a fucking hard,
he was going on the rowing machine.

34
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,450
He goes hard, dude. He stayed in the 80%
on the rowing machine for an hour. I mean,

35
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:00,930
he really did. I saw him, I was the
out there with them. I filmed it,

36
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,370
I put it up on Instagram.

37
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:06,210
That's that point when Burt was making
fun of him for being at 75 for just

38
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:08,010
walking.
Isn't that him being out of shape?

39
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,500
It's not because when
Burton him went walking,

40
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:14,940
he was in way better shape than Bert
[inaudible] rides his bike in New York and

41
00:02:14,941 --> 00:02:18,180
he walks a lot in New York and even
though he's not in great shape,

42
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,450
like in terms of like a guy
who runs in comparison to Bert,

43
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,180
he's in fantastic shape.
When they went hiking together,

44
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:26,390
bird had a stop like a bunch of times we,

45
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,030
so we're going to stop and I was pissed
off. He's like, why do I have to stop?

46
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:32,610
Because you're fat. Like
he's like yelling. Yeah.

47
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,150
So like he wanted to see what would happen
if the two of them went out together

48
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:39,870
and did the exact same hiking.
Who's cause uh, Bert was saying, oh,

49
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:43,620
it's because you're not in shape, so
your, your heart is always at 80%. No,

50
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,710
Ari in a week is in way better shape.

51
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:50,370
That bird is in his whole life of working
out and drinking vodka every night

52
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,470
compared to birth,
but compared to Burke.

53
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,340
But my point is he was my
real competition. I was very,

54
00:02:56,341 --> 00:03:00,220
very much worried about him.
So up until uh,

55
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,070
two days ago,
everything seemed to be going good.

56
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,700
I was working out really hard
and uh, I was put, it was hard.

57
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,670
It's hard to do three hours a day.
It's three and a half hours a day.

58
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,480
Two days in a row is three
and a half hours a day. Um,

59
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,830
but I started peeing and he
started coming out dark. Oh No.

60
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,600
Like ice tea. Oh Shit. This sounds
like a guy at a Porta potties.

61
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,940
Sweet tea.
Sweet tea.

62
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,940
What does it, what does he say at the
end? Oh, bless you. God bless you God

63
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:38,910
for your sweet tea. I
was famished. Um, yeah.

64
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,260
Um, it didn't look good. Oh yeah.

65
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,700
Today I had to go to
some at my kid's school,

66
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:49,260
there's some Halloween thing and I
had to go up three flights of stairs,

67
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,790
free long flights of stairs. I got to top,
first of all, I barely made it upstairs.

68
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,440
I got to the top, I was out of
breath, my legs were shaking. Whoa.

69
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,780
Three flights of stairs. And I was like,
okay, I might have fucked something up.

70
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,470
Oh man, that was today. Today.

71
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,460
What does it mean? Um, I think
my body's breaking down. Ah,

72
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,020
I think I've got like serious
muscle breakdown to the point.

73
00:04:16,021 --> 00:04:18,850
Like my muscles are so sore that I've,

74
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,830
I'm ignoring that they're sore and even
though they're really, really sore,

75
00:04:22,831 --> 00:04:27,210
I'm still doing like three hours of
cardio. Like I limped up to the, uh,

76
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:32,070
to the trail when I ran with
my dog yesterday and then
I ran two miles and then

77
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:35,850
after I ran two miles, I did an hour
and a half on the elliptical machine.

78
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,280
And then after I did an hour and
a half on the elliptical machine,

79
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,850
I did 45 minutes to kicking the bag,
punching and kicking the back.

80
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,070
I took two naps yesterday,
two separate nabs.

81
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:51,390
My point is argus Tommy something by
telling me about this high that you get

82
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:53,620
from all this cardio.
And I was like,

83
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:57,760
what kind of fucking nonsense that I
knew that there's like an endorphin high

84
00:04:57,761 --> 00:04:58,240
but I didn't,

85
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,260
I didn't think it was really specific
but there's a very specific high that you

86
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:07,261
get and it's like if you could take a
pill that puts you in the state of mind

87
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:11,440
that I am when I work out this month,
everybody would take it in the world.

88
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:13,660
Be a better place because
you don't give a fuck. Right.

89
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,640
You don't give a fuck about anything.

90
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,400
I mean not they don't care about
people and friends and loved ones,

91
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,850
but there's no anxiety is no.
All the chatter,

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,970
all the negative chatter that you get
in the brain that you have to like push

93
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:29,440
off and ignore, that's shuts
off. Right. Gone. Nonexistent.

94
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,090
And I wonder how much of
that is there because your,

95
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,160
your brain is almost trying to create
problems and conflict because you're not

96
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:40,210
getting enough exercise.
Yeah. Because your,

97
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:43,090
your body supposed to get a
specific amount of exercise. Huh?

98
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,800
My dog is a, I think like eight
months old or something now.

99
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:49,950
And I've learned a lot from
having this dog this time.

100
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:54,570
Like I didn't notice a lot of stuff
with the other dog stuff, but you know,

101
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:59,300
just the being weird little things by
nibbling at your finger a different way

102
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:02,930
with just her little front teeth, like
sorta like telling you something like,

103
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:07,590
hey dude, I need to fuck
and get some exercise in and
we're all the, we're, we're,

104
00:06:07,591 --> 00:06:08,630
we are that same way.

105
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:13,631
So our brain is going to make more
complex ways for us to be freaked out,

106
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,320
basically run for our lives. Right.
Like if I don't just, I mean, again,

107
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:23,330
I barely do cardio,
but I do do it pretty consistently,

108
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:27,140
but it's short. It's like a mile or two.
That's all you need really. Yeah. But,

109
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:31,490
and it cleanses the palate.
It's like ginger between Sushi slices and,

110
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:36,140
and if I go without it,
absolutely it compiles,

111
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,860
I'll wake up bitter and
angry about something. I'll
see something on, you know,

112
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:42,310
somewhere or something or you work.

113
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,560
Yeah. You know, doing things that he's
not supposed to do. Yeah. He just,

114
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,760
you know, it was just a
ball of energy, but a lease,

115
00:06:50,761 --> 00:06:53,440
he doesn't have like anxiety
and negative chatter.

116
00:06:53,441 --> 00:06:56,500
The complex human mind when it
doesn't have enough energy output.

117
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,251
I was thinking of,

118
00:06:57,251 --> 00:07:00,880
the brain is almost like a battery
that has a lid on it and there's like

119
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,780
energies like flowing out of the battery
and spilling over the sides and causing

120
00:07:04,781 --> 00:07:05,614
a mess.

121
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,180
Cause you've got to expand or expend a
certain amount of energy every day in

122
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:13,200
order to keep it clean, just to keep
everything going. Well, yeah, dude,

123
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,210
I feel fucking great other than
the fact that I can't walk good,

124
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,650
but it's just, I went too
hard. It's just too hard.

125
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,930
But I wanted to get so far ahead.

126
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,680
My goal was to get so far ahead
that no one could catch up.
