Hello Freak bitches.
You know,

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,750
that's another one of the things I tried
to think through is why you should tell

3
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:10,710
the truth. So it's not self evident,
man. A smart kid. The smarter the kid,

4
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:12,000
the earlier they learn to lie.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,830
Lying is very powerful because you can
manipulate the world with your language

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,520
and then you can get what you want lots
of times or escape from things that you

7
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:23,610
don't want. So why not
lie all the time? Well,

8
00:00:23,611 --> 00:00:25,530
I think the reason is
there's a bunch of reasons,

9
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:28,050
but one of the MS is that you
can't trust yourself if you lie.

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,200
And there's going to be times in your
life where you have no one to turn to

11
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:34,620
accept you. And so if you've
stuffed yourself full of lies,

12
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,050
then you're going to be in a crisis one
day and you're going to have to make a

13
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:40,770
decision and you're going to decide wrong
and you're going to be in real trouble

14
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,340
because he won't have the clarity of mind
necessary to make the proper judgment

15
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,350
because you've filled your imagination
and your perception with with rubbish.

16
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,360
So,
and if you really think that through,

17
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:55,920
you see there's this old idea in the
old testament that fear of God is the

18
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:56,760
beginning of wisdom.

19
00:00:56,761 --> 00:01:00,840
And I kind of understand what that means
because one of the things say we do

20
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:04,350
with the future authoring program, we
offer people a little heaven. It's like,

21
00:01:04,351 --> 00:01:06,810
okay,
construct your ideal,

22
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,430
a mad it come up with a plan. You
get to modify the plan, no problem.

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,630
You're going to do a bad job of
it, no problem. Just do it. Okay,

24
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:19,020
so then now you've got a goal and
now you're approached systems.

25
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,280
Technically speaking,

26
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:23,940
the positive emotion systems that
motivate you are you are engaged because

27
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:27,450
they're engaged in relationship to a
goal and the more transcendent the goal,

28
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:29,910
the more they're engaged.
But that's not good enough.

29
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,400
It's great to run towards
something you like,

30
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:35,190
but it's even better to run away
from something that terrifies you.

31
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,120
So then we ask people, okay, so here,
think about this real carefully.

32
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,710
Take all your faults and your inadequacies
and your, your hatred for life,

33
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:46,890
all of that.
And then imagine that gets the upper hand.

34
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,120
And then think about where you could
be in three to five years and everyone

35
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:54,120
knows, hey, some people know
they'd be a street person,

36
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:55,710
some people know they'd be an alcoholic,

37
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:58,590
some people know they'd be a
prostitute or a drug addict.

38
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:02,280
Like everybody's got their own little
hell they could descend into with fair

39
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:06,030
degree of rapidity and a fair bit
of enjoyment and people know that.

40
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,160
And so I say, well,
delineate that out too.

41
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,730
So you know where you're headed
when you fall off the path.

42
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,240
And so then you're running away
and running towards like, yes,

43
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,320
well heaven and hell and you need it.
And they're real.

44
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,360
They're as real as anything that you can.

45
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,920
It depends on what you
mean by real I suppose, but

46
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,640
there's real as you make them.
How about that?

47
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,710
And people can make hell pretty real.

48
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,120
People do seem to construct
these pitfalls for themselves.

49
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:41,510
I mean self sabotage is one of the most
common things that you find in people

50
00:02:42,481 --> 00:02:44,910
that are struggling.
I mean,

51
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,850
you would think that
someone who is struggling,

52
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,650
the last thing they'd want to do is help
themselves towards their own demise.

53
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,890
But it's super common. You have, well,
I've thought about that too. And so you,

54
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,660
you tell me what you think this as. If
you talked to people, they say, well,

55
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:06,520
I want to have a meaningful
life. Generally people want
that. But then you think,

56
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:09,400
well then what? Why aren't
you? And then you think, well,

57
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:12,940
what does it mean to have a meaningful
life? Exactly. And then you think, well,

58
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:16,590
maybe it means that you have to take
on responsibility cause you, your,

59
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,120
your sacrifices have to
be worth something, right?

60
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,630
It has to have some cows to have
some meat. What you're aiming at.

61
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,760
It has to be something that can elevate
your worm-like self to the level of

62
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,570
tolerability. You know, you can say,
well yeah, I've got all these flaws,

63
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:36,280
but look at what I'm trying to do. Right?
That's the real ground of self respect.

64
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,713
Well,

65
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,640
okay.
