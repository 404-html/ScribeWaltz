1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,190
What kind of medication do you have
to take if you're going to go there?

2
00:00:02,191 --> 00:00:05,370
Because you have to take
some anti-malarial stuff,
right? I'm a pin cushion.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,490
Like I had so many shots
and pills and you know,

4
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:14,220
like the preventative, obviously I
actually don't do malaria medication.

5
00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:17,100
I just cover up. Um, because
it messes with your brain.

6
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:20,400
I don't know if you know that. Like I,
they say the new modern ones aren't bad,

7
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:24,030
but the malarone like you
have hallucinations at night,

8
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:27,580
you have crazy sweats like,
especially if you're in hot sun. So I,

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,280
I would rather be more focused,

10
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:32,620
especially if I'm working with reptiles
or stuff like that, that can, you know,

11
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,080
[inaudible] me. So I try and try to stay
away from it and just cover up. Wow.

12
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:42,210
Is there a specific type of clothing
that's like anti mosquito repellent

13
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:45,480
clothing or anything like that?
I just do long sleeves and some bug spray.

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,980
And do you do a mask as well now? No.
That's silliness. Really look silly.

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,730
It does look, so, no, I just do,
you know, good old deet. God.

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,130
That's stuff's gotta be
bad for you too though.

17
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,470
It melts you like if you get
it on like say these things,

18
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:02,370
it will melt the painting, the paint
off of the headphones. It's so strong.

19
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,630
It's probably worse than the mouth.
Have you ever used a thermostat?

20
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,080
What did they call the m
fucking is it called Thermacell?

21
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,450
I think that's was called. Um, it's
um, it's a device that heats up.

22
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:17,520
It's got like an element inside
of it and like a little bit,

23
00:01:17,521 --> 00:01:22,521
a little canister of gasoline and you put
these sheets and it releases this very

24
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:27,810
fine mist. Oh No. Kind of smell and
mosquitoes fucking hate it. No Way. Yeah,

25
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:32,640
we used it in Alberta. Alberta has very
aggressive mosquitoes when they're out,

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,310
when they're out, they're out. It's
like clouds of them, right? Yeah.

27
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:39,330
Cause some of your life for like
three months. Right? It's like Alaska.

28
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,760
There've been a last night. It's the
worst. Mosquitoes have ever seen.

29
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:43,740
Crazy like pick you
up. Yeah. They're like,

30
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,670
there's size of pigeons and
their funnel everywhere. Totally.

31
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,100
And when a fishing with my friend
Ari and we pulled up the, the,

32
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,880
the car and we'd got out of the car
and we opened the car door and within

33
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:58,140
seconds a swarm of mosquitoes
was inside the car. It's insane.

34
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,710
We were screaming like, what
the fuck? This is crazy.

35
00:02:00,711 --> 00:02:02,760
And it's like something out of,
it's a Stephen King movie.

36
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,710
There's clouds and they, I,
I, yeah, that's why you asked
me what I'm scared of it.

37
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,000
That fucking clouds of
mosquitoes, man. Well,

38
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:12,110
we're very fortunate we don't have
malaria here in the United States. Yup.

39
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,560
Absolutely. If it made its way
over here somehow, you know, I, um,

40
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,320
I wear this fabric. You're talking
about Thermacell called hex.

41
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,670
Hex. Exactly. And, um,

42
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,270
I wear for a lot of reasons because I
definitely feel it helps me get closer to

43
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:31,460
wildlife, but I've noticed mosquitoes
do not like it real. So that's,

44
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,000
that's what a heck suit is for,

45
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,610
for people that don't know
what we're talking about.

46
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,900
So it's this interwoven carbon grid that
actually holds the body's electrical

47
00:02:41,251 --> 00:02:45,270
energy and capacity, like
the door of microwave oven,
like a faraday cage. Right.

48
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,960
And so you naturally admit electrical
energy and then when you wear this

49
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,790
clothing,
it's got this conductive carbon grid.

50
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,280
And when you touch the ground or something
at grounds it and releases all the

51
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:56,730
energy. So birds migrate or
using. Yeah, there you go.

52
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,750
Now has it had been proven
that this stuff actually work?

53
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,370
I mean it has been proven that it has
an effect on the electrical energy that

54
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:03,821
you released,

55
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:06,880
but has it been proven that the animals
can actually recognize that electrical

56
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:08,380
energy and with certain animals?
Yes.

57
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:13,060
So we know that electro
reception is certain wildlife's
capable out of birds use

58
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:17,290
it to migrate. Sea Turtles
Use magnetic poles to migrate.
Um, they just discovered,

59
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:22,291
I believe 2014 that lobsters antenna
have electrical detective sensors or

60
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,390
electro reception is the word. Um, so it's
proven on some things, not everything.

61
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:28,601
You know,

62
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:33,601
our understanding of animal behavior and
animal adept till ability is constantly

63
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:36,700
growing. So it's passive,
you know what I mean?

64
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:38,530
I wear it because it's
a passive technology.

65
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,170
It's like I'm going to
wear a shirt anyway.

66
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,060
Why not wear one that
might or might not help?

67
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:47,260
So I feel it helps my friend
John Dudley is a bow hunter. Yup.

68
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:51,440
Pretty famous bow hunting.
I know John. Yeah. Okay. And
He, and he swears by it. Yeah.

69
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,330
Yeah. He wears them constantly. He's like,
it makes a big difference. I think. So,

70
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,700
you know, like I'm, I'm not hunting,

71
00:03:57,701 --> 00:04:00,550
I'm just trying to get close to stuff
and interact with it or find something.

72
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,400
But I feel it makes a difference.
Notice a difference personally,

73
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,370
especially with birds. Um,
I've noticed a huge difference.

74
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,960
I've noticed a huge
difference in the water.

75
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,580
Some mammals I've noticed a
difference. Um, but yeah, I like John.

76
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:15,760
I feel like it's, it helps me
get closer and you know, keeps,

77
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,590
keeps the energy down.
Do you know what I mean?

78
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,320
Like you're admitting all this energy,
you see this bear or whatever it is,

79
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:23,920
your heart's spikes, your adrenaline
goes and it keeps that in capacity.

80
00:04:23,921 --> 00:04:27,820
So I think we sense that. I think
certain creatures sense that. And I,

81
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,130
I like to keep that out of
the equation. Right. The,

82
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,840
I guess it would be that there is
something coming off of your body and it

83
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:38,260
probably would be an advantage for
animals to be able to recognize that just

84
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:40,600
because we can't quantify it,
right.

85
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:42,940
And put it on a scale and weigh
out or something like that.

86
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:45,160
It's probably something going
on Predator prey, right?

87
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:48,800
Like if you're aligned and I'm
an, I'm an antelope and, uh,

88
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,320
my adrenaline spikes and my
heart's going and you know,

89
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,460
you're going to come for me, right?
But if that's out of the equation,

90
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,970
the energy stays reduced.
