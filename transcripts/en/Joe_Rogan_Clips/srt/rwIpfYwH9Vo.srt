1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,550
Racist.
Do you know how I'm going to do that?

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:04,590
I'm going to shit all over this racist,
this racist Rosanna.

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,200
They don't care if you're really racist.

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:10,130
But the thing that gets me about it is
it's, I'm going to shit all over this Jew.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:10,940
Yeah.

6
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:15,940
Because I was talking about Iran as a
Jew and speaking about Persian Jews and,

7
00:00:16,491 --> 00:00:19,970
uh, you know, all kinds of error. Can
you talk to them about complexity?

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,540
It is complex, but I always was
on there talking, uh, you know,

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:29,600
defending or, you know, speaking
for Jewish people. And so,

10
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,570
you know, I just, I think
that in the long run,

11
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:37,571
I really want it to be known that I
am a Jew and was speaking as a Jew.

12
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,650
And when I spoke about the Iran
deal and its effect on, uh,

13
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,460
Jewish people in the Middle East,

14
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,780
and I really thought first
they didn't know that,

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,310
but now I think, well, they
had to know some of it.

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,240
I don't think they want to know.
This is what I think you say.

17
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,930
Someone says that's a black woman.
What does she one eighth black,

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,660
like what is she? Um, something very
small, 46% or something. Really?

19
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:09,250
Yeah. She had her DNA done
was talking about it. Oh.

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,830
And 40 something allocation
and it doesn't look good,

21
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,420
but whatever,
whatever.

22
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,950
We can't tell who people are by
how they look on 1.6% African.

23
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,450
Cool. Awesome. That's
the heart of the world.

24
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,310
When you look at what happened.
I think it's real simple.

25
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,300
I think she identifies where people
identify her as a black woman.

26
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,660
You said planet of the Apes Racist.
Yeah. Boom. It's that simple.

27
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:38,250
I don't think they give a fuck of,
you're a Jew.

28
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,440
I don't think they care
if you're not racist.

29
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,400
I think this is a viable target
when they go out so well,

30
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:48,750
I said I voted for Trump. I was a
target that too, that too. And then,

31
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:54,030
and then they can find a, a tweet from
the past. Let's not forget either.

32
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:58,490
Oh yeah. My got in trouble for that
long many times. Yeah. You know,

33
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,880
there's just things you can't say and
then there's worse things that you can.

34
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:07,380
So it's weird cause they don't censor
anybody who's, you know, calling for, uh,

35
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:11,250
you know, to kill all the Jews. There's
thousands of them. They don't give.

36
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,590
You shared about the not famous women
with sitcoms. Yeah, they are who, uh,

37
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,250
you know, people that are, are
tweeting support for Valerie Jarrett,

38
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,350
uh, you know, are pissed at me and
saying, how could you say this about,

39
00:02:26,351 --> 00:02:29,190
they're not saying that because they're
saying kill the juice. They did,

40
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:34,070
did don't they don't maybe know
what your point was. I didn't know.

41
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,020
Like I didn't know about her
parentage. I mean, come on. This is,

42
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:42,700
this is the truth. This is who I
am. And you know, they, they uh,

43
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,640
they did this too, but they're
not really saying kill the Jews.

44
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:49,690
It's not like a valid comparison.
Well, I'm a Jew. I understand that.

45
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,330
But the people that, that's how it feels.
Maybe it feels that way. Yeah, it does.

46
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,680
But the people does to
a large number of us,

47
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,310
they're upset at you because they think
you said something. I know they're not

48
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,930
saying kill the Jews.
Well, but they are to us.

49
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:11,020
Okay. You see how when people
look at your situation,

50
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,740
I can see how they think,
but,

51
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,510
but you see how when people look at your
situation and they think it's racist,

52
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,590
that is also how you look at,

53
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,310
they're reacting to what they think is
racist and you thinking that they're

54
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:25,510
saying kill all the Jews.

55
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,890
Well they're saying like, uh, you know,

56
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:33,010
Iran every day threatens the Jewish
people in Israel with annihilation and

57
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:39,170
they've already survived, you know,
not too long ago. An annihilation. So,

58
00:03:39,171 --> 00:03:42,740
and then we make a deal with
that government. What does
that does say something.

59
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,970
I understand that,
but this is many steps past.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But to me that you said a racist thing
or thinking you said a racist that they

61
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:55,060
think I said a racist thing. Yeah,
I understand that completely.

62
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,600
They have no idea that this had
anything to do with Jews versus Iran.

63
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,210
They really don't have any idea that,
I've never seen that.

64
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,450
I've never seen that registered by the
people that are upset at you because it's

65
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:07,570
not important enough to
them to know that well,

66
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,840
it's probably not been explained
to them. Yeah. For one,

67
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,990
I know your position like this,
like you're,

68
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,870
you're talking about now I understand
that they might not even think it's valid.

69
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,970
Like if they went back and went over it,

70
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,840
how might disagree with the
political aspects of it. Yes.

71
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:25,930
And they're free to do that. I'm not
going to try, but they're not alive.

72
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,370
You know what I'm saying?
Like they're not,

73
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,140
the reason why I said it's
not a valid comparison.

74
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:30,610
They're not really saying kill the Jews,

75
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,920
but to me and to other Jews, they
are in fact saying that. And,

76
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:40,220
and that's very common amongst
us. So you know, that's,

77
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,260
that's the truth that many of us think.

78
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:49,640
And you know it, people are
understand it or they don't, you know,

79
00:04:49,641 --> 00:04:54,560
care to even consider it.
Well, they don't have to,

80
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,490
but I'm still going to say it
because that's the reality.

81
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,200
It's the reality.

82
00:05:00,201 --> 00:05:04,880
To hear that and to hear the United
States went and gave them billions of our

83
00:05:04,881 --> 00:05:09,320
tax dollars when they're the number
one supporter of terror in the world.

84
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,280
It is.

85
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,540
And they always do kill Jews like
in Paris and wherever else they go.

86
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,590
And they do it in London too. I mean,
you know, I hate to wake people up,

87
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,740
but you know,
it is important.

88
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:26,630
At least it is to me and to people
like me and to many other people,

89
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:28,970
many Christians,
it's very important to them too.

90
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,360
They're there under onslaught too.

91
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,470
I'm not exactly sure what you're talking
about because you're talking about

92
00:05:34,471 --> 00:05:38,220
Iranians killing people
in Paris and England.

93
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,430
No, I'm talking about being the number
one sponsor of terror in the world. Iran,

94
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:48,530
but they're killing people in France
and England. Yeah. That are Jews.

95
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,300
When,
when is this happening?

96
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,000
Well, when they that theater
and a lot of other times,

97
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:57,030
but there's a lot of babies that
all Jewish woman to death and,

98
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,020
and her Paris apartment,
there's a lot of it.

99
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,550
I'm not saying they only killed Jews,
but they do kill deuce

100
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:11,110
and the money goes back to those
terrorist organizations that are funded by

101
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,800
Qatar and Iran. Okay. This is a,

102
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:20,280
this is a pretty, these, these are
general things you're saying, right? Yeah.

103
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:24,410
It's very general and there's a hundred
shades. There's a hundred shades.

104
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:28,280
But I'm just saying as a
Jew with a family in Israel,

105
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,490
this is what we think and
that this is how we feel.

106
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,440
And to not even acknowledge that and
any discussion is kind of disturbing.

107
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,710
It should be factored in. I don't think
it's a matter of not acknowledging it.

108
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,720
I think she'll be factored in as well.

109
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,990
They're aware that this had anything to
do with your motivation? Well, I'm out.

110
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,520
I've never read it anywhere. You
can't say it. That's what I'm saying.

111
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:55,490
He can't say it.
It's not really a smiled on to,

112
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,800
uh, go against the, uh,

113
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:03,110
people who control our media and say,

114
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,820
especially,
uh,

115
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,920
social media and say that you're a pro
Israel or you know, that you think,

116
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,233
um,

117
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,860
okay.

118
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,760
You don't think that the media will
allow you to be pro Israel. I mean,

119
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:20,870
that seems like a really common thing.
Not on social media for the most part. No,

120
00:07:20,871 --> 00:07:25,030
it's very anti Israel. You'll,
I'll send you statistics. Well,

121
00:07:25,031 --> 00:07:29,150
I see some anti Israel sentiment,
especially in relation to a,

122
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:34,390
they treat the Palestinians
like I see a lot of that.

123
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:38,190
Yeah. Well, I, I'm not going to
play into either of those because I,

124
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,070
I really believe that, uh, you know,
there's a solution to that problem.

125
00:07:42,071 --> 00:07:44,560
The solution is pacing and
I think it can be achieved.

126
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,370
So I'm not going to play either one of
those games about who does this and what.

127
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:53,440
I just like to see a solution that works
for all the people. They're all people.

128
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:57,710
They're so, um, but it can't be. Yeah,

129
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,960
but it can't be,

130
00:07:58,961 --> 00:08:02,980
if one side has been
completely censored and it,

131
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:08,010
that isn't a discussion or is it a
debate and nor is it an American scary.

132
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,870
It's scary times when, you know,
like on our college campuses today,

133
00:08:13,871 --> 00:08:17,380
I know this because my son
was on one and uh, you know,

134
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,870
it's a far left.
They're far left,

135
00:08:19,871 --> 00:08:24,490
professors that espouse that kind of
stuff daily. And all of our colleges.

136
00:08:24,491 --> 00:08:29,050
And it does find its way to the media.
You look at the media that most,

137
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,960
what are they called, millennium
millennials consume and it's heavily,

138
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,290
uh, to the left. It is. Yeah.

139
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,050
And so that's where they're
informing. They're, they,

140
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,200
they are getting their opinions from
only hearing one side of things on social

141
00:08:46,451 --> 00:08:48,130
media.
And I don't think that's good.

142
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,330
I don't think it's good that all
conservative voices are being censored off

143
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:56,100
Twitter. You know, and well
not all, I shouldn't say all,

144
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,180
but so many are because that's a
way to shut down discussion too.

145
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,390
There's quite a few conservative voices
on Twitter, but some are when they,

146
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,680
they think they're inflammatory or they
think they're espousing hate. Yeah. Yeah.

147
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,390
But they get to decide that.

148
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:14,030
But deciding that it's people
who are heavily political. Yes,

149
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,700
yes. That's not right. It should be
companies lean left, all of them.

150
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,040
It should be more in the
middle where we're both sides
are considered to come to.

151
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,740
That's what consensus
means is a diverse opinion.

152
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:29,310
And that's how you reach consensus.
You don't get a consensus.

153
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,320
So Nora solution from only listening to
one side blather on the same ship for 20

154
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:39,180
years. That keeps people fighting at each
other, not only to keep people fighting.

155
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,010
I think it recruits
people for the other side.

156
00:09:41,011 --> 00:09:43,080
I think it does the opposite
of its intended effect.

157
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,800
That's what one of my friends said.
He said he thinks Michael Moore,

158
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:49,800
that's Michael Moore's role
since he's a billionaire too,

159
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,060
that he's a billionaire. Well, they said
this is what they said. I don't know.
