1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,430
The last thing that I definitely
wanted to talk to you about,

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,970
it's one of the things that Trump
brought up recently is the, uh,

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:11,570
JFK case and releasing some of the
files and they wanted to redact the

4
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:16,800
information that pertained to
the people that were still alive.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,180
Now I want to know what, what,
I don't know what you could say,

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,170
but what do you think about the JFK case?

7
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:27,390
Do you think that Lee
Harvey Oswald acted alone?

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,270
Um,
I can see

9
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,660
of all the,
of all the sort of incidents of all it is,

10
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,400
I don't mean to minimize it, but, or I
minimize it by calling it an incident.

11
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:45,360
But if all those situations,
the Kennedy assassination and Mlk,

12
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:46,740
Martin Luther King's assassination,

13
00:00:46,741 --> 00:00:50,640
those are the two that I understand more
than anything else. Why they've linkerd,

14
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:53,400
why people don't believe the shit
that they've seen and why they,

15
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,930
why they have concerns about it. Uh,
Martin Luther King more than Kennedy,

16
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,820
I believe that there was something there
that we still don't understand in terms

17
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:07,500
of who else was responsible
and who organize that and
who, who assisted in that.

18
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,980
Right.
I just think of those two.

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,600
That's the one I've got bigger
questions on the Kennedy assassination.

20
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,240
I think that, uh, I think that
Oswald pulled the trigger.

21
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,970
I think in his mind,
uh,

22
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,920
the reason he was doing it
was for the greater good of,

23
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,720
of communism and to, uh, boost
his image with the Soviets and,

24
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,380
and, uh, w with the Cuban regime. Um,

25
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,680
do I think that he had assistance?
Um,

26
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,080
I don't, you know, I don't think so,

27
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:51,060
but I could be swayed from that with
better evidence than I've seen. But, um,

28
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,870
I understand why people are so dug in
on it, right? Because I mean, look,

29
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:57,300
it was a massive event,
right? It was a massive event,

30
00:01:57,301 --> 00:01:59,820
but Oswald had sufficient training.

31
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:02,880
You did not have to be a rocket
scientist to figure this out.

32
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:05,850
It was a different era. And we don't
understand it in today's terms,

33
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,290
but when you get right in that position
and look out that window and look at the

34
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:14,520
shot that was taken and you know, what
was involved in that, I was not, uh,

35
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:19,210
you know, you've shot, you
know, this sounds terrible,
but you know, every, you know,

36
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,960
anybody who's hunted, you know, has taken
a more difficult shot in that. Yeah. Um,

37
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,650
so that part of it and,

38
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:30,210
and his motivation and his
past ties to the Soviets.

39
00:02:30,211 --> 00:02:32,580
Do I think the Soviets were pulling the
trigger on it too? I think the mafia,

40
00:02:32,581 --> 00:02:33,430
we're pulling the trigger.
I,

41
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,240
I haven't seen anything that
convinces me that that was the case.

42
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:39,850
I think that Oswald felt like he was
doing it for them or he was just,

43
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:44,170
he was going to prove himself in
that regard. But, uh, again, I,

44
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,060
I understand why people were dug in the
MLK one, Martin Luther King. I just, um,

45
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,410
I think that,

46
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,940
I don't think he acted alone.
What makes you think that?

47
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,290
Um, I think that, look, he was a loser,

48
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,180
a two bit criminal,
right?

49
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:07,630
Who was constantly getting picked up for
the shit that he was doing and ending

50
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:11,590
up in jail. Right? He was a mess, right.
There was nothing clever about him.

51
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,130
And then leading up to the assassination,

52
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,800
he cleaned up his act. Suddenly he went
from looking like a two bit, you know,

53
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:24,670
criminal and all to a
college professor basically.

54
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,680
And he had cash. He was able to, you know,

55
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:30,070
purchase a vehicle and he kind
of went off the grid for a while.

56
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:31,720
He went on to this drive,
right.

57
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:36,721
And sort of stayed off the grid and he
behaved in a way that he hadn't up until,

58
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,670
you know, months before this thing took
place. And then he ended up in Europe,

59
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,770
you know, and, um, I just, uh,

60
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,670
something tells me that he had, um, uh,

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,420
assistance in some fashion. I don't
know who right or whatever, but I just,

62
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,550
that's the one that more than, than any
others that I've looked at, you know,

63
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:05,140
makes me step back and go, no, we don't,
we don't know the whole story here. Um,

64
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,450
the Kennedy thing,
I again,

65
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:10,600
maybe there's something out there
that we just haven't turned over. A,

66
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:15,160
that's always a possibility.
But, um, yeah, MLK I think is a,

67
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:18,010
is that's the one that's most disturbing.
That's interesting.

68
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:21,820
I don't know enough about the MLK murder.
I need to go look into that now.

69
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:26,780
Especially if you think that something
was going on. Look at his behavior. Um,

70
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,010
what the hell was his name again?
James Earl. Ray. James Earl Ray and I,

71
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,590
I've talked to his brother, I've
interviewed his brother. Um, for what,

72
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,830
uh, for a shell, a series a
where we did a, uh, kind of, uh,

73
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,580
investigative look into this. Um, and um,

74
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,040
I there is, if you, if,
if all you do when you're,

75
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:56,041
when you're looking at this is to look
at Ray's behavior in that year leading up

76
00:04:57,251 --> 00:05:01,480
to the assassination. Um, that's the,

77
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:03,940
that's the interesting for me, that's
the most interesting part. I mean,

78
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:06,280
put it in context with everything he
did up until that point, which was,

79
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:09,610
he was basically, again, just a tube
criminal, couldn't stay out of jail.

80
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,750
And then you get this and you get this
change in behavior and this change in

81
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:17,620
appearance in this, you know,
sudden ability to, you know, be, uh,

82
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,980
something that he wasn't up until that
point, I guess everybody can change.

83
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:24,250
But that was, that was the
most striking part for me. Um,

84
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,390
there's no obvious source of
income? No. No, just, just uh,

85
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,470
just to, you know, just again, just a
penny. Any criminal basically. And um,

86
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,890
there was plenty of information.

87
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:39,370
It wasn't like he couldn't have gathered
if you say, well no, he acted on his own.

88
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,100
Well. Okay. Yeah. Was
there information? Yes,

89
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:45,340
the leading right up till the day before
there was talk about, well, you know,

90
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:50,020
there were news reports showing a king
at the Lorraine Motel. Um, and you know,

91
00:05:50,021 --> 00:05:52,510
coming in and out of the room,
you know, that he was staying in.

92
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,750
And so it wasn't as if,
you know,

93
00:05:55,751 --> 00:05:59,720
you couldn't gather that information on
your own, you know, but it was, again,

94
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:03,440
it was that behavior leading up to it. And
I'm not a conspiracy guy at all. Right.

95
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,070
I've seen too much shit to, you
know, to think that, you know,

96
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:12,170
every conspiracies home water.
So, but this one, it was
disturbing in that regard.

97
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,730
What that's worth. All right. Yeah.

98
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,080
You should look into it and we'll talk
about next time. See what you think.

99
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,760
Cause I, I'd really be
interested in, I think,

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,120
I don't think we're going to this show
that we're going to get ready to do here,

101
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,540
start filming and next month is not going
to be looking into things like that.

102
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,600
What is it? What is it called? It's
going to be called black files.

103
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,900
They may change the number or the name
just before we go on there. But um,

104
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,720
you know, I really enjoyed the
shows that I did in the past.

105
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:38,360
American declassified with the,
they're looking into conspiracies.

106
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,200
I've really enjoyed it.
I really,

107
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,420
really thought it was fascinating
and I get why people feel that way.

108
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,360
Kennedy for sure it's Kennedy
when they're on the outside.

109
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:50,170
The Kennedy wanted to me the bullet
is the most disturbing thing. Yeah,

110
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,660
the pool would that just showed up on
Connolly's Gurney. Oh look where we found,

111
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:57,800
we found this spot and it's not distorted
and supposedly went through two people

112
00:06:57,801 --> 00:07:02,220
and shattered bone, that magic bullet,
the magic bullet. So I don't buy it.

113
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:03,920
And I don't think that that
bullet came from there.

114
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,970
That's probably the most of
all things. So, cause we,

115
00:07:05,971 --> 00:07:08,840
we looked at the grassy knoll issue and
the possibility of spa getting other

116
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,690
people on the side. Yeah. The
fuck out of here. Dot. Bullet.

117
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,460
The bullet drives me crazy.

118
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:17,420
It does that there's more pieces of the
bullet fragments in Connolly's body.

119
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,140
When you look at the,

120
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,200
look at the x rays of Conley's
bodies that show bullet fragments,

121
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:25,250
there's little pieces they found little
tiny pieces of metal in his body from

122
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:28,310
the bullet fragments. Huh. But you
don't see that missing from the bullet.

123
00:07:28,311 --> 00:07:33,200
It's bullshit. Yeah. The, the bullet
thing is, is, and, and I, you know,

124
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:35,900
again, there's, there's
elements of it that you look at,

125
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,850
but collectively, I just,
you know, and again,

126
00:07:40,851 --> 00:07:42,110
maybe there's something else out there.

127
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,300
Maybe there is and we just
haven't uncovered yet.

128
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:48,740
Or maybe this will prompt some additional
information. Who knows? But, um,

129
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,910
yeah. Anyway, it's, it's
fascinating shit. But, uh,

130
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:56,120
I do get it because it was
such a seminal moment. Right?

131
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,420
And nobody wants to think that
something that bad, that horrific.

132
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:02,150
And that's something that could sort
of shatter the country in that fashion

133
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,650
could be done by one, one guy, Mike
Lee Harvey Oswald, or John Hinckley.
