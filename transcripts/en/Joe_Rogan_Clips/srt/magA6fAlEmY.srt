1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,960
Search net gear for Tyron Woodley had
some choice words about Colby coven too.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,660
Yeah, he was, uh, you know, talking
about Colby, like campaigning,

3
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:12,360
hard to get the fight and talking
all kinds of crazy shit about him.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,940
But Tyron was saying like this,
first of all,

5
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:18,330
everything he's saying about our
training sessions is 100% bullshit.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,440
And he's like, when I get that dude in the
octagon, if he ever does get that shot,

7
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:25,960
he goes, I'm going to fuck him up. I said,

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,090
he was Colby Covington is never going
to fight again after he fazes me.

9
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:34,350
That's what he said. Yeah, he was,
we were talking before the weigh ins.

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,700
We were standing around the octagon
before the weigh this past UFC in Detroit

11
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,150
and he was, he was like
shaking his head and he's like,

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,270
I'm gonna fuck that dude up. He's
like, he does not understand.

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,390
He's not on my level. He's talking
to all kinds of shit. He's, you know,

14
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,500
writing all these checks that there's
no way he's fucking talent can cache.

15
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,500
And when I get them in there,
I'm going to smash him and he goes,

16
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,080
I'm going to take my time on him.
I'm gonna try to hurt him. He,

17
00:00:58,081 --> 00:00:59,340
this is what he said to me.
That was crazy. He goes,

18
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:04,290
I have never tried to hit anyone with all
my power in the octagon. And I'm like,

19
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:07,800
wait, what? That's not possible.

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,280
He sends people flying across the aisle
and watch his fight with Jay Huron.

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,110
Oh yeah you can, you can hit
somebody harder than that.
Are you sure? Cause that's,

22
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,340
that doesn't seem normal. That doesn't
seem right. Talking about his leg kicks.

23
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,220
I was just going to ask you,

24
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:23,960
what'd you think of being
there for the Gates Alvarez?

25
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,040
That was great. Gosh it was amazing.
There was two fights that night that made,

26
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:32,220
there was, there were humbling.
Um, that was one of them.

27
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,570
That fight was humbling like
the fucking guts and glory.

28
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,880
Watching those guys go at it.

29
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,120
But Yancey Madeiros and cal by
Oliveira might've been even crazier.

30
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,830
I think that was the
craziest fight of the night.

31
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,030
I believe that one performance of
the night. Thank the baby Jesus.

32
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,860
Cause if it didn't,
there was some criminal shenanigans afoot.

33
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,150
It was the craziest fight ever.

34
00:01:57,151 --> 00:02:00,150
They one would get rocked and the other
would get rocked and you'd think the

35
00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:02,490
fight was over. And then the other
one come back, a rock, the other one.

36
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,650
And then finally Yancey
one and the third round.

37
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:08,550
I mean it was just a fucking k odic war.

38
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,230
It was such a good fight.

39
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:15,180
Just such a good fight to bonuses to
fight of the night awards. That's nice.

40
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,520
See,
that's what I love about the UFC when,

41
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:20,760
when people really perform and
lay it on the line like that.

42
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,020
But did Allah did Haldo uh,
although in Holloway,

43
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:29,850
when any sort of a fight of the night,
I know Francis didn't,

44
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:30,840
but they said they were,
yeah,

45
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:32,620
they were going to hook him
up with some sort of a bonus.

46
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,600
How do you not give that Guy Kao the
night? What? What are we doing here?

47
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,550
What is it?
What's that say?

48
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,560
It just says that those
two guys fight at night.

49
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:47,310
Didn't say anything about
anything else. Oh, okay. Well.
So does it says that fight,

50
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:49,610
that fight of the night? No,
no, no, no, no. The Gate,

51
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,910
she g and Cowboy Oliveira Yancey
Madeiros got fight of the night.

52
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,630
Well Max Holloway's performance
was nothing short of masterful,

53
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,050
nothing short of Masto. The way
he handled Aldo, the way he, he,

54
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,830
he yelled at me after the first round,
he gets done with the f,

55
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,290
the round that he runs, he's going
back to his and he looks at me, goes,

56
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,620
the man is tired,
the man is tired.

57
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,990
He's a motherfucker,
dude.

58
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:18,910
Max Holloway is a real fucking warrior.
I mean to the core,

59
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,300
that guy relishes it. He
loves it. When he was like,

60
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,030
like chicken neck in it all
though he's got his hands down.

61
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:28,810
He's talking shit to them and stalking
him. You could see it in all those face.

62
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:30,010
Like he was drowning.

63
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:33,430
He would see the waves were coming and
he knew he wasn't going to be able to dog

64
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,250
paddle for too long.
Like he's like Jesus Christ.

65
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:37,720
Like how am I going to
keep up with this guy?

66
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,900
And the thing about Max Holloway that's
so interesting is he's in a lot of ways,

67
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,490
he has that sort of Nick Diaz approach
where he's not hitting you with all of

68
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:51,220
his mind. He's not throwing
these haymakers and less,

69
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:54,220
he's got you hurt until he's got you hurt.
Once he's got you hurt,

70
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:56,140
then he's just fucking
whip and bombs your way.

71
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,670
But until then he's just constantly
on you just constantly peppering you,

72
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:03,850
constantly, your kick knee punch,
move forward, move forward,

73
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,540
and you're just dealing with
him and trying to breathe.
You don't get any breath.

74
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,740
And he just keeps that pressure on you.
And he knew all those fading, right?

75
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,150
And I'll tell you all to look good.

76
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:15,340
And at first I thought he's
going to start picking it up.

77
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,390
Like almost the old with the leg kicks,
he should get clay kick, clay should have,

78
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,253
he should have gone.

79
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:24,150
His strategy should have been almost
entirely leg kicks centered. Right?

80
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,830
And he was trying to catch him and he
caught him with a couple of good punches.

81
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,500
But all of his punches are sprints,
right?

82
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,330
And if he doesn't knock
you out with those sprints,

83
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:33,400
like he only has so many
of those in the gas tank,

84
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:38,110
you're fighting the guy that can do it
for a marathon and he and he can and Max

85
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:38,531
Holloway,
Ken,

86
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:43,531
he is so well conditioned and so aware
of visibility and not stretching himself.

87
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,060
So when they got to the third he started
slugging it out with all though at the

88
00:04:49,061 --> 00:04:51,880
very beginning of the third he's like,
I know this guy's tired. He goes,

89
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:55,840
I'm going to make them sprint with me.
And you could see like as the,

90
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:58,990
the beginning of the
third round played out,

91
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,400
all was swinging wild at and
I was watching it. So I was a,

92
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,290
I was going like this is not conservative.

93
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,780
Like he's not conserving
his energy at all.

94
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,790
What he's doing is trying to take Max
Holloway out with one shot and he's

95
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:15,040
blowing out his entire wad doing this.

96
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,010
And then you saw Holloway
just calming out,

97
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,210
common on common on just bang,
Bang, Bang, pop, pop, pop, pop,

98
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:25,330
pop and all of those trying to move
his head and he's using all his head

99
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:28,570
movement. But he never gets a break. Yeah.
It's an incredible pace that Holloway.

100
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,080
That's incredible. It doesn't give
you any space. You don't get any rest.

101
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,870
You don't get it. He does. There's
no laying back with Holloway.

102
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,720
Max Holloway's on you, on you, on you.

103
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,460
I love what he said about fighting Aldo
in Rio too. He goes, that's what kings do.

104
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,540
He goes, they go to the other person's
village and they'd take the crown.

105
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,160
It's like, Ooh, it's right. It's
what they do. That's what he did.

106
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,700
He's the baddest motherfucker. I think
he's the best one 45 forever. I mean,

107
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:57,740
he might not agree with it yet
because of the record, which I see.

108
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,590
I see his point,
but the way he fights the,

109
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,160
the octagon Iq that he shows his,

110
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:09,220
his fight Iq is ability to find a weakness
and to see it as predatory behavior

111
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:13,970
inside the octagon. I think he's the
best. I really do. I just think I, I,

112
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:18,971
it's so impressive to me that he's not
like all doe in his prime was spectacular

113
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,880
and amazingly impressive.
Like his flying knee,

114
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:27,440
first round knockout of Cub Swanson. The
knockout of Chad Mendez, you know, I mean,

115
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:32,060
he's, he's the, the Uriah Faber fight.
We brutalize your rise leg. I mean,

116
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:36,650
he's unquestionably one of the greats
of all time, but in my opinion,

117
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,950
skill wise,
Max Hallway has now surpassed him.
