1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:01,680
Hello

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,530
Freak bitches.
I can,

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,530
my mom was cleaning houses.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,100
It would make it $6 an hour.
My Dad,

5
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:14,820
teamster warehouse foreman and uh,
they,

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,220
we get a watch poor growing up,

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,370
lower middle class and
then went to the school.

8
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:22,650
You sent me to school in San
Francisco with all these rich kids.

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,300
So I was doing all these rich houses
and houses in, uh, if people don't know,

10
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:30,450
San Francisco at Pacific Heights
is really nice and it's old now.

11
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:33,240
It's like fucking $12 million houses
and that's where we were hanging out.

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,470
Parents would have abandoned them on
the weekends and we'd have run of these

13
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:39,720
fucking houses.
Just crazy.

14
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:42,820
Like my buddy broke a $25,000
vase and then we're like,

15
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,440
let's get the fuck out of here. We'll
pay for it. And we were in all these,

16
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,640
I was like smoking some guys
Cubans on sitting in his chair.

17
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,350
I'm a kid from the inner sunset district
who shouldn't be all of these places,

18
00:00:55,351 --> 00:01:00,351
but I think that's what lit a fire under
my ass because I'm working for the,

19
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,090
my mom eventually has just great rags
to riches story where she was working at

20
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:11,091
this company and then she became an
account rep and then she became the head

21
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,380
account Rep.
Then she began to vice president.

22
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:17,370
Then she bought the company and
quadrupled the company in size. Wow.

23
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,140
And that's where I went to work for her.

24
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:22,620
Even though I wanted to be a
standup comic, I go to work for her.

25
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:27,660
I am firing people for living,
which is a whole nother fucking thing.

26
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,650
And just say I really was
forced into this. Very tough.

27
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,510
My Dad and my mom were very
fucking brutal. Half Mexican,

28
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:39,000
half Sicilian. I could have, again,

29
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,270
I could have been up there and
miserable fucking with, you know,

30
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:43,920
firing people nonstop.

31
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:46,650
And it's like taking on other people's
problems because that's what I did is

32
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:48,930
like if you have a business
or you work somewhere,

33
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:50,760
we'd employ everybody working there.

34
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:52,530
So you didn't have to deal
with any of the headaches.

35
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,790
But then I got all the headaches,
so I've been chased like a,

36
00:01:56,791 --> 00:02:00,420
I had a guide who was a Taiwan knees,

37
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,500
like you sick this banner.
He was working in a doctor's office,

38
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:07,560
but on the weekends we found out
he was pretending he was the doctor

39
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:14,500
who's seeing patients, his own patients.
But he's a physical therapist and uh,

40
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,730
um,
orthopedists office.

41
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,780
So I go in there and I've been
doing this awhile and again,

42
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,650
I've been in so many awkward situations
now I'm doing stand up and I'm even more

43
00:02:24,651 --> 00:02:28,250
awkward situations and I just
go up and I go, hey Twon,

44
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,590
you know, Jig is up. I go, today's your
last day. We find out what you're doing.

45
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,840
He grabs me,
puts me up against the wall,

46
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:40,040
he gets one of those physical
therapy sticks, you know the big,

47
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,160
like the pole that you stretch
with behind your back and stuff.

48
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,390
And he has one of those cut in half
and he sticks it right up to my throat.

49
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,840
And now I'm cool. And
so I go, Twan, I got,

50
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:53,930
you got two choices here.

51
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,430
You're going to hit me with that stick
and I'm going to call the cops and I'm

52
00:02:58,431 --> 00:03:01,250
going to press, you're going
to go to jail. Somebody piss.

53
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,740
He hit me with that fucking stick.

54
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,730
Or you can take the final check that's
in my breast pocket right here and walk

55
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:08,170
away.
What's it going to be?

56
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,330
And I'm held up against the wall by
my throat with the fucking stick,

57
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:16,060
our face and so had some crazy situation.
So I'm, what did you say to him?

58
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,780
You said the Jig is up. I know you're
not a real doctor. Yeah. I go, hey,

59
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,250
how you doing? You shouldn't be here right
now. We know you're seeing response. No,

60
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,390
this is not true. You know like in Chula,
like you going to go, he spoke English.

61
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,350
Yeah. She's a physical therapist. You
banging chicks too? I have no idea.

62
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,400
I would liked it to be that way.
Yeah. That's a better story.

63
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:40,450
If there's a way to heal you.
I lost my car.

64
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,640
So I had Russian nurses running from
me and just crazy stories like why were

65
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:47,040
they trying to do too? Yeah. Uh,

66
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:51,550
well this Russian nurse was
in an allergist's office
and she was giving wrong

67
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:56,230
doses to the kids and stuff of shots.
So I had all my documentation,

68
00:03:56,231 --> 00:04:00,700
like these yellow pads that goes, there's,
um, we, you see, right. I'm 22 years old.

69
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,490
You can see right here, Dan,
she tries to grab it now.

70
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:06,400
It's a tug of war across a desk and I
don't know what the fuck is going on.

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,920
And um,

72
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,610
she takes off and runs down a
hallway and I'm 22 and I go, shit,

73
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,220
I fucking run down the hallway afterwards
and she goes into a patient room and

74
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:16,391
10,

75
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:19,260
she locks the door and then I get the
door open and she told somebody to unlock

76
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,570
it and she's in there and she's talking
to her husband on the phone. She goes,

77
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:26,530
I'm through, there was a mum here who's
telling me lies. He's telling me lies.

78
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,560
I didn't want to tell you this.

79
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,910
I am pregnant and I'm going to
lose the baby because of his mom.

80
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,320
Oh my God.
Totally freaking out.

81
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,630
So I had a tea to teach.

82
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:46,530
A bunch of Vietnamese people had a shit
and it was one day I got a call. Wait,

83
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:52,040
I got a call from the sky issue.
Well they were her mungs. Okay.

84
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,890
You know what Hmong is like
if you saw a grand Torino,

85
00:04:54,891 --> 00:04:57,830
that movie with Clint Eastwood,
I think the H is silent.

86
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:02,860
I think the h m o u n g is and yeah.

87
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,740
And then there are people without a land.
Yeah.

88
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,270
And then they call came to San Jose,
California to work in assembly plants.

89
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:16,790
So they're in this cable assembly pant.
A plant called Cable Co.

90
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,990
That was a big client of ours. And I
got a call from this really cool guy.

91
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:24,140
His name is chip chip bronc. And he
goes, Al, you got to get down here.

92
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:27,230
You're not going to fucking believe it.
And I got a situation and I go,

93
00:05:27,231 --> 00:05:29,150
what is it? And it goes better. You see

94
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,870
when to go into the bathroom,
Shit. Everywhere. What?

95
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,770
Cause they had never been used to toilets.

96
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,900
So they were standing on the toilet seats.
I found out that's what was going on.

97
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:44,270
They all had fake names
like the names Food Kelly.

98
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,270
But you can call me Keith
like, Hey Keith, fluke,

99
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:51,350
Lee, can you come here for a
second? Can I tell you about this?

100
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:55,880
The shit everywhere. Like on the
ground. Yeah, there were missing

101
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:01,460
a toilet seat is not fucking hold you up.

102
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:04,930
So they're waddling up there standing
on the standing on the toilets.

103
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:08,690
So they were just used to like shitting
and shitting in holes. Oh my God.

104
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:12,330
If they're lucky, you know, in the
woods or whatever. Jesus Christ.

105
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,570
So have you been lucky? Not
Lucky where they hold it
forever. Yeah, just backed up.

106
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,740
It's becomes a brick.
Yeah. So, um, anyway,

107
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:26,090
I gathered everybody around.
I just appointed a bathroom
monitor and oh my God,

108
00:06:26,091 --> 00:06:29,510
a bathroom monitor. So I had one
on the guys who was a supervisor.

109
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:33,740
I had a clipboard. I put a lock
on the map room door. And then,

110
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,620
so you become this corporate fixer.
That's what I was doing.

111
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,620
And I always wanted to do standup comedy.
I love standup comedy.

112
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:42,740
I grew up in the city, which is
listening to comedians on the radio.

113
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,650
And all the great comments was
two comics who lived on my block.

114
00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:48,590
And so I love lived on your block,
Mike Pritchard and Michael Meehan,

115
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:53,540
two great comics. Mike Pritchard, one the
first San Francisco comedy competition.

116
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:58,550
And Ron Williams looked up to him and he
was like, [inaudible]. That was his idol.

117
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,620
And he was on my block. And you don't
money Hoffman. Yeah, money Hoffman.

118
00:07:02,621 --> 00:07:05,930
I would be eight years old on my
bike and I'd ride down the block.

119
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:09,380
And Mani Hoffman and Mike Pritchard
used to put their tee shirts over their

120
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:13,220
heads. You know how you can do like
just the face pops out of the hole.

121
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,190
And they used to pretend they
were the California raisin guys.

122
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,790
You guys are hilarious.
This is amazing.

123
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,160
Yeah.
