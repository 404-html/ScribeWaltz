1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,040
I really wonder if there's,

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,990
there's a bottlenecks for progress that
are going to be that we're going to run

3
00:00:06,991 --> 00:00:09,420
into. And I think, um, uh,

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,050
ultimately inflammation
is one of the big ones.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,520
And information also in
a lot of ways is money.

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,850
You know,
I mean when we think of money we're,

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,820
we're thinking of ones and Zeros that
are being moved around on bank accounts.

8
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,470
It's data.

9
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,550
I mean it's attributed to different people
and you get to do more things because

10
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:36,390
you have more of these numbers and more
of these things. But what is it really?

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,180
It's not gold based anymore.
It's not a physical material,

12
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:44,230
a material object that you're coveting
now it's some weird thing and it's kind

13
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:49,410
of like information on a database. And
what if we get to a certain point in time,

14
00:00:49,411 --> 00:00:49,980
and I,

15
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,980
I sort of feel like in this weird vague
abstract way we're moving towards this

16
00:00:55,231 --> 00:00:56,064
with all,

17
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,100
it's one of the things that I want to
really step back and wonder about this

18
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:02,790
trend towards socialism and,
and social democratic thinking.

19
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,440
I wonder what that is and I honestly
think that we're moving towards this idea

20
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:08,280
that, hey, you know,

21
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:12,900
we've got a lot of fucking problems that
could be cured if you move some of that

22
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:17,730
money around and, but, but should you be
able to move some of that money around?

23
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,720
And when,

24
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,720
what happens if that money
becomes something different
than what if people start

25
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:29,541
developing social currency instead of
financial currency would have your ability

26
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:34,830
to do things was based on how much you
actually put in. I mean, we're assuming,

27
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,630
right? We assume that the way we do
things now where if you want to buy a car,

28
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:43,250
you have to have $35,000 that's how much
a Mustang costs and you've got to bring

29
00:01:43,251 --> 00:01:45,870
it to the bank and this and that.
And you can prove alone.

30
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,000
But what if we get to a time in the future
where it's not these pieces of paper

31
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:56,001
that gives you material objects but
rather your own actions and deeds provide

32
00:01:56,701 --> 00:02:00,570
you with social currency that allows you
to go on vacations or allows you to eat

33
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:02,460
at restaurants.
It allows you to do things.

34
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:05,970
And there's this running tally that's
not outside of the realm of possibility.

35
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,111
No,

36
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:12,111
I think it reward systems
within everything that we're
using are gonna are gonna

37
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:16,510
rise up. I mean that, that's, that's what
we're already kind of doing. I mean, we,

38
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:20,010
we reward tokens for,
for activity.

39
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,140
We're going to see that rise up
in more things that we're doing.

40
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,300
But what I'm saying is
if we're doing it in,

41
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,920
if it's a social currency and that your
own personal behavior allows you to

42
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:36,060
access more freedoms or,
or more goods or more things,

43
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,390
it would encourage positive behavior and
community based behavior because that

44
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:44,100
would be the only way to advance.
I mean,

45
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:48,810
obviously this is a long
time down the line, but when
the first caveman, you know,

46
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:52,650
traded the first fucking shiny rock
for the first spearhead, you know,

47
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,100
whatever it was that they did that started
this whole inevitable trend towards

48
00:02:56,101 --> 00:03:00,970
money. This is not something that
has to be this way forever. You know,

49
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:04,840
and I w I wonder when we're looking
at the distribution of information,

50
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:08,260
which is arguably not arguably,
it's never,

51
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,450
never been like what we have today.

52
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,500
There's never been a time in human history
where everyone had so much access to

53
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:18,010
information that you used to have to pay
for. He used to have to go to schools.

54
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:21,670
You have to use to have to earn your
way to the position where you could open

55
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:25,270
the very books that had
all this information in at
night, get it off your phone.

56
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,430
It's instant.
And I,

57
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,570
this is a whole different
way of interfacing with
information and I think this

58
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:33,490
is going to affect higher
learning institutes.

59
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:35,260
I think it's going to affect
a lot of different things,

60
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:40,030
but I wonder if this all can
be applied ultimately some day,

61
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:41,140
maybe not in our generation,

62
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:46,141
but someday to money that people start
using social currency and that social

63
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:51,340
currency is going to be almost
like we have some sort of a,

64
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,830
a database of social
currency in this country.
