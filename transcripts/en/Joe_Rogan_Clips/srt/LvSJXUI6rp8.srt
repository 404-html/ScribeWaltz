1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,350
Ladies and gentlemen. Jeff Novitsky. How
are you buddy? What's Up Gel? Doing good.

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:11,310
You have to ask you, do you mind
the nickname the golden snitch?

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,990
So first thing I was going to bring up
this golden snitch bullshit.

4
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,640
I just want to say it's not my nickname.
It's Brennan jobs.

5
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:24,810
He came up with it 100% on his own. It was
going to ask you. It's all good though.

6
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,250
It's good. It's all good. So a couple
of funny stories about that. So I don't,

7
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,390
when did he come up with this?
About a year ago at least. So,

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,310
so people in the office started
coming up to me saying, hey,

9
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:38,060
golden snitch and what the hell is that?

10
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,780
Do a little research as she something
about Harry Potter or some character named

11
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:47,280
there. I'm like, what the hell does this
have to do with me? So about a month ago,

12
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,890
somebody lets me know,
hey, checkout Wikipedia.

13
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:53,550
So for whatever reason there's
a Jeff Novitsky Wikipedia page.

14
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,150
You go to that page. Now it says,
says, actually my formal name,

15
00:00:57,151 --> 00:00:59,760
Jeffrey John Lovitz,
he aka the golden snitch.

16
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,240
So last week, dawn and mark,
Eleni, you know, Donna, um,

17
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,100
long 15 year employee of the UFC now
works with me and talk about her a little

18
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,490
later. It's a great asset to what we're
doing. She sends me a text, she says,

19
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:18,540
check this out.
So she's got one of those Amazon Echos.

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,630
Um, Alexa, I think so. She says Alexa,

21
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:24,480
who's Jeff Novitsky and
Alexis name says Jeffery.

22
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:27,270
John Novitsky Aka the golden snitch.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,950
So thanks a lot. Shop Shove. What have
you done? That's hilarious. I love Donna.

24
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:39,000
She's amazing. She's awesome.
So she's over there. I mean,

25
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:40,620
you know about kind of her history.

26
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:44,910
She's more of the five original employees
of UFC was Dane as assistant to start

27
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:49,650
out with, uh, went on to become VP
of event operations. So basically,

28
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,910
you know, she got everybody to the
event set up hotel at the event,

29
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,250
ran the crew, you know, the
blue shirts backstage that
run the event. Um, you know,

30
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:03,000
I think after doing it for many years,
she got a little burnt out on it.

31
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,360
So when to Dana a mid summer and says,
look,

32
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:08,490
I don't think I want to do this anymore,

33
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,470
but I'd really love to do something else.
And,

34
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,590
and I've seen kind of what
Jeff's doing in his program.

35
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:17,430
I realized to go over there and work
with him and kind of learn, you know,

36
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,540
what he's doing. And so Dana pulled
me into the office and said, Hey,

37
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,890
what do you think about this idea?

38
00:02:22,891 --> 00:02:26,610
And it took me literally a half second
to say a hundred percent onboard.

39
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,920
This woman, I mean, as you probably know,

40
00:02:28,921 --> 00:02:33,210
is about as attention to detail and
passionate about her work as anybody.

41
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,130
And really my positioning,
unlike the, the, the name,

42
00:02:38,131 --> 00:02:42,090
the golden snitch is an advocate to our
athletes to make sure our athletes are

43
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:45,150
successful under the program.
Not that they fail under the program.

44
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,730
It's definitely the wrong
nickname. It's just catchy. It is.

45
00:02:47,731 --> 00:02:52,200
It's unfortunately catchy. Again, I'm all,
I'm all good with it at a roll back. But,

46
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:56,940
uh, the real golden snitches,
Victor Conti, he's the
Golden Snitch, right? Yeah.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,980
I mean, I was actually
a see that. I can see,

48
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,720
because he was a guy who
was giving guys steroids.

49
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,940
You were a guy that was always
catching people. Correct.

50
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:05,890
So it's the wrong moniker. Yeah. Correct.

51
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,510
Giving them steroids and
then talking about it after,
right? Yeah. That's a snitch.

52
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,240
Yeah. That's the golden stage.
Not You, man, but it's all good.

53
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:17,150
I was hoping shop with you
call him up later in this show,

54
00:03:17,151 --> 00:03:18,150
but I could do anything to him,

55
00:03:18,151 --> 00:03:22,300
but it'd be interesting to look at him in
the face. He would say, I'm sorry, Bro.

56
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:22,900
Sorry.
