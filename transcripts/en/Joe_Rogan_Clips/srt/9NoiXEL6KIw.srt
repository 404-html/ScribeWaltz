1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,990
Such a fucking benefit for me.

2
00:00:02,991 --> 00:00:06,980
It's like when the world gets weird and
the world, my world is weird as fuck man.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,700
You know, I try to explain it to people.
I'm like weird being me, you know?

4
00:00:10,701 --> 00:00:13,290
And to be able to just
take some time and just go,

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,190
it's just look at it
all through fresh eyes.

6
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:19,520
Like that's the place for me of that tank.
Do an hour.

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,220
I like an hour.
But I do too.

8
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:26,080
If I have the time I like two
hour session would be yeah, God.

9
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,920
And then you have it here
is what it's all about.

10
00:00:27,921 --> 00:00:29,720
So I can just do it anytime I want.
Hell yeah.

11
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,630
Like I wake up at three o'clock in the
morning. You just drive over here. Sweet.

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,430
You w what's your morning routine like?

13
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,140
Or do you have a morning routine
that you like? Are you sure?

14
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,720
Kind of fasted cardio. That's
what I like to do. Or fasted yoga,

15
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,730
that's my most recent thing as I'm doing
either 14 to 16 hours depending upon

16
00:00:45,731 --> 00:00:49,770
what my day looks like.
Intermittent fasting. And then, uh,

17
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,190
I usually either like yoga or running in
the morning today was running and then

18
00:00:54,191 --> 00:00:55,750
I'll do something in the afternoon.

19
00:00:55,751 --> 00:00:59,050
Either martial arts related
or weightlifting related.

20
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,670
Do you, uh, do you drink coffee
every morning? Like when you were,

21
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,500
when you wake up or,

22
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,520
not always, but I like it. I like these
things. She's Nitros who's caveman?

23
00:01:06,521 --> 00:01:08,560
Nitros a lot like regular coffee too,

24
00:01:08,561 --> 00:01:11,950
but I drink water with Himalayan salt in
it too. That's one of the first things.

25
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,710
Yeah. I can put a little
lemon in there two times.

26
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,830
Sometimes I'll throw a little
cayenne pepper in that mother fucker.

27
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,840
Any apple cider vinegar to that stuff
sometimes too. I take a lot of probiotics,

28
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,060
a lot of, I eat a lot of Kimchi. I
find like Kimchi and game meat is like,

29
00:01:28,061 --> 00:01:31,630
I've been on this kick for the past three
or four months where I just eat Kimchi

30
00:01:31,631 --> 00:01:35,470
and l collect three, four times
a week. I mean, on stuff do it.

31
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:38,890
It's hard when you eat some elk before
bed and you wake up hard as a rock on the

32
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:43,420
fuck people up. People
don't know, man know. Wow,

33
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,300
you're heating a super athlete.
If you eat elk, your eat,

34
00:01:46,301 --> 00:01:49,480
you're literally eating a super
athlete, you know, that's bad ass.

35
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,290
It's like a huge, like another
reason, not just a doctor Andy,

36
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:53,430
but listening to you,

37
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:55,410
you talk about it because it's
in your podcast all the time.

38
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:59,220
Talk about how how beneficial eaten those
kind of meats are. And I'm just like,

39
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,360
God, I got to do it. And I would just,
I feel, I feel so much better doing it.

40
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,380
Well if you think about like how health

41
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,250
see it is eat salmon,

42
00:02:07,251 --> 00:02:10,580
like a healthy wild salmon that is a,

43
00:02:10,581 --> 00:02:13,630
an animal that's out there hustling,
you know,

44
00:02:13,631 --> 00:02:15,740
a salmon making its way up river.

45
00:02:15,741 --> 00:02:19,940
You eat one of those things is just
loaded with nutrients and essential fats.

46
00:02:19,941 --> 00:02:22,040
And when you eat an elk man,

47
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:26,480
you're eating an animal that's getting
away from wolves and bears and fighting

48
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:28,850
to the death with swords
grown out of its head.

49
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:34,130
I mean literally it's a forest horse
with fucking spears grown out of its head

50
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,870
and they're just out there
hustling Sirius all day. You know,

51
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,190
living out in Montana in the winter,
in the middle of the fucking winter,

52
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,180
running from wolves and shit.
I mean, that's their life.

53
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,890
You eat one of those things you eat.
It's like, Oh fuck you get charged up.

54
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,270
It feels, I've given it to people that
never eaten it before and they're like,

55
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:57,410
Holy Shit. And I'm like, yeah, you
feel different, right. You feel

56
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,410
even there.
Their DNA.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,330
Do you ever do listen to Paul Chek, Paul
Chek, he's the Juco condo guy, right,

58
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,480
isn't he? No. He's been on
Aubrey's and stuff. He's a no,

59
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:10,450
I'm thinking of Paul Vernac. I'm
thinking of different guy. Yeah,

60
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:13,930
I've have listened to Paul
Chek. I listened to him on
Aubrey's pot is amazing.

61
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,370
Fuck,
he's a wizard.

62
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:20,371
He was explaining how a pasture raised
eggs versus just regular eggs that were

63
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,490
literally eating the DNA of
that chicken and it was he,

64
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,070
I don't remember what exactly he
said, but it blew my mind. I was like,

65
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,430
he's awesome. He would. That'd be,
that'd be a good podcast. You and him,

66
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:34,360
that would be sweet.
[inaudible] showed me so sweet chickens,

67
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,710
they love to eat.

68
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:40,711
Bugs and worms and grass and they love
to roam around and if they are allowed to

69
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:42,430
do that,
they get a dark,

70
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,810
like an orange yolk that you just don't
get from those God damn grocery store,

71
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:48,220
egg, chicken souls, grocery store,

72
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:52,750
chickens are prisoners getting little
prisoner eggs eaten that putting it into

73
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:55,000
your body,
it's better than nothing,

74
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:00,030
but it's nothing like a farm
raised free ranging chicken egg.

75
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,780
And you could get those at farmer's
markets and stuff like that, like,

76
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,820
but you could tell the moment you crack
them open. Yeah. I mean it's just orange,

77
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:10,150
like the sun, you know, take care
of your chickens. Yeah. Y'All have

78
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,210
whatsapp. Are they a pain? It's not the
easiest thing really. You know? Yeah.

79
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:19,310
You got to clean the shit and you got
to make sure they have enough food.

80
00:04:19,311 --> 00:04:21,040
And for me,
I've got a squirrel problem.

81
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,280
My wife wants to kill the
fucking squirrels. Me. I'm like,

82
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:27,520
they're cute little fellas. Right?
But they steal all the food.

83
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:28,900
They're fat fucking squirrels.

84
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,750
They keep figuring out a way to get
into the chicken coop and get all the

85
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:34,090
chicken food.
And they're just in there all the time.

86
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:37,330
But now I might have to put them to
death because I found out they'd been

87
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:41,080
stealing eggs. The squirrels have now
figured out that they can get eggs.

88
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:45,820
And so a squirrel was trying to roll an
egg out of the chicken coop through the

89
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:50,290
hole that he comes in. We caught doing
that. I didn't catch it. Catch them.

90
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,300
How are you going to get a little fucker?
I Dunno. I Dunno. I bet it feels good.

91
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,730
I've never,
I never hunted and uh,

92
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,750
but it feels good shooting and then
eating the meat you get good does.

93
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,770
I'm nervous though, because I feel like
I'd feel so guilty shooting an animal.

94
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,410
You will. I remember I shot up
there a little longer. Look at it.

95
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:13,000
We've got an egg that's yours.
I'll pull that back. Jamie.

96
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,110
This, I had no idea that squirrel's did
this. I had to find out on my own yard.

97
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,330
These little funny faces. Their egg
Steelers, Bro. They, how do they know?

98
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:26,080
How do they know? They're so cute.
They're so cute. How did they know?

99
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:31,690
They fucking know at Chad, a little
motherfucker. You got the chickens.

100
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,230
Chickens don't know what
to do. It's money. Yeah.

101
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,110
Squirrels or they're not smart,
but they're determined.

102
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,300
I think I might have to run a fucking
Arrow through a few of them. Yeah,

103
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,470
but I don't want to kill the squirrels.
That's the city.

104
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,090
You don't want them eating my eggs,
but I also don't want to kill them,

105
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,740
so I don't know what to do.
I know.
