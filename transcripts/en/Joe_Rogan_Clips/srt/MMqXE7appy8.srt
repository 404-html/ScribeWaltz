1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,800
Although I did see this amazing
video of Buzz Aldrin to do seedless

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,420
punching the guy go to, I know that
guy that he punched. I want to,

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,200
I want to do more moon landing tonight
mean I know you know Alex Jones.

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,360
I used to be a moon landing denier.
I used to believe,

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,730
I used to believe totally that we never
went to the moon because there was a

6
00:00:16,731 --> 00:00:19,820
document of the came
on Fox. Yes, trust me,

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,200
I didn't Google the nineties in the
1990s Fox had a show called conspiracy

8
00:00:28,581 --> 00:00:28,911
theory.

9
00:00:28,911 --> 00:00:32,180
Did we go to the moon and they aired it
on television prime time and they got me

10
00:00:32,181 --> 00:00:36,800
hook, line and sinker, and for years I
believe that we didn't go to the moon.

11
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,460
What changed you?
Mostly talking to Neil degrasse Tyson,

12
00:00:40,461 --> 00:00:41,930
but also critical thinking.

13
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:47,020
Also realizing that I was fully committed
to that idea without really exploring

14
00:00:47,901 --> 00:00:52,310
the possibility whether that idea was
incorrect and that I had taken everything

15
00:00:52,311 --> 00:00:53,540
that I saw in that documentary,

16
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:57,350
which is incredibly convincing
and with a 100% confirmation bias.

17
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,560
I only looked at that and I didn't
look at all the contrary evidence.

18
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,320
There's some fucked up stuff about
the moon landing unfortunately.

19
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,180
And the fucked up stuff is mostly people
that were involved in publicity that

20
00:01:08,181 --> 00:01:12,440
we're doing stupid things
with photographs. Like they
had taken a picture of 'em

21
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,970
I'm going into unchartered
territory or just so you know,

22
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,920
like you're an expert on this. I've never
gone into moon landing. Denialism yeah,

23
00:01:20,921 --> 00:01:21,754
I don't know about it.

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,520
Uh, it was buzz Aldrin. Um,

25
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,330
who was the guy that was Michael Collins?

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,150
Michael Collins in Gemini 15 photographs.

27
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,880
He seen it many times. Pulled
up that photo. This is,

28
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,570
and this is what I'm talking about. No,
no, no. It has nothing to do with that.

29
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,500
This is a photo that they,
um,

30
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:43,550
they put out as an official photograph
of Michael Collins doing a spacewalk.

31
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,060
But what it actually is,

32
00:01:45,061 --> 00:01:49,290
is a photo of them testing equipment
and they blacked out the background.

33
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:52,410
So he's in this suit that they were
doing with testing and instead,

34
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:55,020
because they really couldn't get good
photos in space cause no one's out there

35
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:59,580
with him taking his pictures.
Right. So they lied, they
faked it. This is it. So the,

36
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:00,510
see the one on the left,

37
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:04,140
you see the real photograph and this is
him in a studio where they're working on

38
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,460
him try or warehouse rather or some sort
of a testing environment working on how

39
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,294
to,
uh,

40
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,770
control these harnesses that you would
use when you were on a space walk.

41
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:14,980
Cause that thing,
you know,

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,760
propels him forward and back
and he's learning how to use it.

43
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,080
What they did was they just blacked out
the background and reversed it and then

44
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:25,290
they sold that as him
actually being in space.

45
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,980
So this is probably an overzealous
publicist and there's a bunch of these,

46
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,520
there's a bunch of these when it comes
to, um, different backgrounds in,

47
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,600
in areas of the moon. There are many,
many miles apart from each other.

48
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:40,530
It shouldn't be the same background and
more likely than not what you're dealing

49
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:44,730
with is overzealous publicists because
photographs were incredibly difficult to

50
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:45,564
get.
I'm sure.

51
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,800
Well, the moral of this story
to me, thank God, first of all,

52
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,540
that you're no longer
a moon landing denier,

53
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,840
but also the power of the media and the
press and like you saw one documentary,

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,430
right? Was a couple after I
saw that and not quite a few,

55
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,660
but that sent you down
this rabbit hole and that.
