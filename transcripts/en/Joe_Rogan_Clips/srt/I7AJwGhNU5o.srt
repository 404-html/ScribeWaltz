1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,840
No, he's, he's wicked.
He made one for my dog.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,890
It did John Wick and as fuck too. Oh
he did? John Wick and his daughter.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,950
That's from John Wick dose. Not
John Brick. Uno twisted [inaudible].

4
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,230
Can I get a couch surfing from
John Wick? One ran was, I'm wrong.

5
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,340
Well it's from John Wick one that he had
the pit bull. Yeah, it was, yeah. Yeah.

6
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:26,911
John Wick two.

7
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:30,850
They killed the Beagle and then he had
the pit bull and they started going to

8
00:00:30,851 --> 00:00:34,950
killing spree. It doesn't have a three out
now. They're another one working on it.

9
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:37,140
Yeah, it's coming out
soon. Yeah, he's cool cat.

10
00:00:37,141 --> 00:00:40,850
I ran into him at a deus
ex machina down and uh,

11
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,420
Santa Monica Venice area and he was
on one of his bikes and it super cool.

12
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:47,550
Rad Dude. Just, hey, what's up man?

13
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,640
Keanu Reeves must be one of the nicest,

14
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:53,980
coolest people in the planet cause no
one has a bad word to say about that guy

15
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,260
ever. He might, he might be
what we should all sprite or be,

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,740
we should all aspire to
be Keanu Reeves who are,

17
00:01:00,741 --> 00:01:04,020
you might have some really crazy secrets.
No, I don't know that he's the nicest.

18
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,960
It seems like everybody runs
into him, you know, like,

19
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:09,570
I'm sure there's some people that ran
into you where they caught you the wrong

20
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:13,470
way and they're all went sideways
for a little bit. Nah, not really.

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,850
I mean I,

22
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,050
but no fucking Keanu Reeves. He
got it going on. But the point,

23
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:25,740
what I was going to get to is one of the
things that those movies did was they,

24
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:31,370
they elevated the profile of those muscle
cars because she saw that movie and

25
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:35,460
they went, this guy for this, something
about him. I know he's murdering people.

26
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:36,840
I know he's the best at murdering people.

27
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:39,540
I know he killed three guys in a
bar with a pencil. I know that.

28
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,310
But look how fucking cool he looks.
He's got, he's got the dopest suits.

29
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,210
He's killing people. He's
not killing people. And An
underarmour rash guard. Okay.

30
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:50,070
He's killing people in the dopest suits.

31
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,180
He's stabbing people in the neck
and he's driving a 70 Chevelle ss.

32
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,530
But the trick is unlocks your
fore mentioned and loved Eleanor.

33
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,410
It wasn't plasticized.
It was a real fricking muscle car.

34
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,650
Didn't have shit hanging all over it
and extra side pipes. You're right,

35
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,460
you're right. But you're also wrong
because Eleanor, look at that.

36
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,810
God dammit, I forgot to kill
somebody. I'm doing it just like that.

37
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,310
God, come on, it gets out of a
shit. He's got craters on it.

38
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,840
A Chevelle ss from 1970 with
Craig's. It's Torque for us. Look.

39
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,690
Yeah, look how good he
looks. Well that or style,

40
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:32,340
um, that, that's a classic white
wall tire. I mean, come on man.

41
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,090
Or white letter tire raised white letters.

42
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,600
That's class and you can get your
own now you can get your name on it.

43
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,170
You could do anything.
You'd have gas.

44
00:02:41,171 --> 00:02:44,760
There's a team that sells like
see stickers, monkey tires.

45
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,370
I should fuck Keisha.
You can actually order stickers now that,

46
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,560
that are the rubber letters that fused
themselves into the rubber on your tire.

47
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,370
So you end up with a white letter like
that and you put anything on there. Wow.

48
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,130
Like Joe Rogan or
constantly.
