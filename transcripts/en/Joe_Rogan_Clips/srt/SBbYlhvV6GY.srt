1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,140
Well, it's also this thing, this need
to belong and need to be accepted.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,410
Like we work to be accepted instead of
work to be someone that you would want to

3
00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:11,130
be a part of the group.

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,750
And instead of being like really honest
about who you are and how you think and

5
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:19,080
how you behave and how you operate in the
world instead of doing that and trying

6
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:23,280
to improve upon that,
you try to project an image of this.

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,320
Then what,
here's a question for us.

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,640
Why is vice signaling so much more
powerful than virtue signaling?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,550
[inaudible] signaling. Like a person
who had missed their problems,

10
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:35,940
like an alcoholic who steps up and says,
I've got a real issue. Could be that way.

11
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:40,650
Or it could be sort of Dan Bilzerian type
Visalia. You wanna know what I'm into.

12
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:44,420
I'm into hot chicks, weed and
guns and a lot of mines, uh,

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,720
tons of money and showing it off.
Well, he's super honest right now.

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,910
That's one of the reasons. And you,
he's bulletproof in that regard.

15
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:54,000
Like you can't fuck with them. Like
you can't say, hey, look at you.

16
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:58,740
You're just a playboy. He'd be
like, Yup. Yeah. Like girls.
Yeah. It works. Yeah. Um,

17
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,390
what else? I'm nice. Like he's a nice guy,

18
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,030
talked to Dan Bell's area and he's
friendly. He's not bad guy. No, I mean he,

19
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,880
you know, he had, he had this
post, which was, uh, he was,

20
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:12,450
I think offering a hand to a woman up
the stair and it said, come with me.

21
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:17,340
I'll ruin your life, but it'll be fun.
No, it was just like, it's so disarming.

22
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,270
Yeah. And I think that this
is also partially, you know,
a secret to your success,

23
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:26,210
which is that you're a nice guy. You're
really into fighting. Um, you know,

24
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,750
you hunt elk, you're clear about
which ones you're going to kill,

25
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:33,490
which ones you won't based on
the reproductive cycle. You're,

26
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:37,080
you're promoting all sorts of things
that people don't want to talk about to a

27
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:40,170
fairly conscious level.
And it's produced, um,

28
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,730
an incredible level of trust in an era
where all of the virtue signaling gives

29
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:49,050
way and mean. If you scratch any
person, uh, enough below the surface,

30
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,040
you're going to see that they're
really warning you about themselves.

31
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:58,041
And so the people who are the
most sort of self critical,

32
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,800
and this is like, you know, I think
I brought this up recently, uh,

33
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:06,480
on Twitter about Metta honesty where there
was a, in the Castro in San Francisco,

34
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:07,130
there was a,

35
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:12,130
a bar restaurant that was
advertising a free food,

36
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:16,200
naked servers plus false advertising.
And you know,

37
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,360
it was just fun and playful
and as a result, uh, you know,

38
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,530
you had an instant desire to
eat there and to trust them.

39
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,070
And so I think that in this
world of virtue signaling,

40
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:29,420
vice signaling is really the
growth industry and that's,

41
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,320
that's what's working for good people
because they are more in touch and you

42
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:34,830
know,

43
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,760
they are going to lie to you and they're
going to do all the self interested

44
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,730
things, but they're not going to
surprise you quite as much. Well,

45
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:44,190
in the case of Dan Bilzerian, I really
don't think he's going to lie to you.

46
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,080
I don't think that's what he's doing.

47
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,760
I think what he's doing is living like
a guy who's got $100 million and happens

48
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:55,761
to be 35 years old and likes to bang hot
chicks and fly around in private jets

49
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:58,470
and live in some fucking
house that he's got.

50
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:02,200
He bought some crazy house and like
Bel Air, I guess what that weed money.

51
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,260
Jesus is cat.

52
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,020
It looks like you probably cost $100
million or something ridiculous like that.

53
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:12,040
It's a fucking insane house, but that's
what he likes. You know the guy drives,

54
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,430
likes to drive around Ferrari's and d and,

55
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,430
but he's a nice guy so it's
like, well, where, what's,

56
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:19,840
what's wrong with this picture?

57
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,270
What's wrong with this picture is
he's doing things that, look at this.

58
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,080
This is his house.
What in the holy fuck is that?

59
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,270
Does he have a golf course when his roof?
What is that?

60
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,760
This is a fucking ridiculous house.

61
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,780
Look at this fucking place he gives
us address out. Is that as a dress?

62
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,010
It's pretty hard to hide that thing. Why
the fuck would he give his address, Alex?

63
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:41,800
I don't think you can get there. It's
in Bel Air. Whoa. Look at this house.

64
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,390
It's preposterous. Anyway. This is what
he likes. But it, why is that bad? I mean,

65
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:49,450
look, we only have a hundred years
if everything goes perfect. I know.

66
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,690
What do you give a shit?
Like why does everybody get it shipped?

67
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,870
But they do give a shit.

68
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:56,200
They give a shit a lot because for a
lot of folks that are working, you know,

69
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:59,140
making a good living, making, you
know, 50 grand a year, whatever,

70
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:03,130
that's completely out of the realm of
possibility and his lifestyle wouldn't be

71
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:06,160
sustainable for them. I mean,
yeah, cause he's taking real risk.

72
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,540
There's no question about
it. When you, you know,

73
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,190
you get everybody stone and then you take
them to fire automatic weapons out and

74
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:15,040
the desert. Oh yeah. That's real
risk. And also the gambling,

75
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,430
he does a lot of like crazy gambling.
Well, but this is the thing about the, uh,

76
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:20,200
the relationship with the unforgiving.

77
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:24,490
This is partially why you're
a UFC and Jujitsu life,

78
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,820
is that when you have a relationship
with the unforgiving, you can say,

79
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:30,430
you know that guy, that guy doesn't really
know what he's doing, but then you're,

80
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,930
you're in the ring.
You know,

81
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:35,290
you're the man in the arena and you
find out very quickly whether or not the

82
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,110
trash talking, you know,
paid off or it didn't.

83
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,460
And I think that many people have no
relationship with the end forgiving.

84
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,200
Like you'll take them out on a hike into
the, let's say, the Trinity Wilderness,

85
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:50,890
and then two hours in, they'll just
sit down and say, I want to go home.

86
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:55,830
And you're thinking like, okay, you're,
you're signaling something. But there's,

87
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,540
there's no car service and there's,
we're not calling a helicopter, you know,

88
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:02,530
it just, there's this, if
you live in the social layer,

89
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:05,500
you're surprised by the existence
of the unforgiving. But.
