1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,750
Try My day,
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,020
I'm not mad.
I thought about Jujitsu going on here.

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,110
He's been going to salsa mustache
bodied up in this great head.

4
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:15,490
Mr. Steal your girl at that picture.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,800
I wish I go. Okay, so here's the question.
We're in the round three now, right?

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,970
It's four 44 axes down to let's be,
I would say,

7
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,780
right if you had to look at this
scorecard, but interesting rounds, right?

8
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,840
The Max has got his,
both guys have gotten things off,

9
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:36,840
but all the looks fucking sensation to
the second round was little inch of the

10
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:40,830
first round. I was like, well,
Mexico, Brandon, please make
tee shirts. You're crazy.

11
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:44,490
I was interested in the first round.
I'm saying that first round though,

12
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:45,770
Max really got outclassed.

13
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,650
I don't think there was a big long
period the beginning of where everybody's

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,010
waiting for somebody to move to.

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,780
True and then although eventually
got the best of the exchanges,

16
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,800
he's just showing somebody trying to
get them back kicked back to what the,

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,110
Oh nope, he's laying them out. This is
some, oh, here's the other thing you got.

18
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,580
How many wars,
all those already been in

19
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,460
a real fight, like took a lot out of them
as the Chad Mendez thing though. I mean,

20
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:18,420
and also Connor, he's had
to Ricardo, Ricardo, lamas,

21
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:20,730
fight lamas had him on his
back and he's punched him.

22
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,900
Nick [inaudible] crazy. But he was
on antibiotics when he was a shit.

23
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah,
this Brennan please

24
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,490
both of them. Although it that
sweet need. I know. I don't know.

25
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:45,090
I'm hating on all though.
I don't get it. Oh,

26
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:47,670
I'm Max the wind for some reason.
You know what?

27
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,630
One of the best things that's
ever happened at a being
a commentator is learning

28
00:01:51,631 --> 00:01:55,500
how to appreciate just a
performance [inaudible] favorite.

29
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,990
I always had favorites, man.
Always when I was early right hand.

30
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,660
I try not to now, but like if
somebody that I'm friends with,

31
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,620
like if cowboy fights, it's the worst.
It's hard. It's hard for me. Very,

32
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:10,440
very hard for me to call it. Your fights
were the hardest I've ever had to call.

33
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,160
Really hundred percent so hard I've
ever had a call. So you have to like,

34
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,820
oh my God, oh, he's
hurting. It's not over yet.

35
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,730
Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh.

36
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,660
Oh. She'll grappling going on, right. Oh,

37
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,240
let them up. I'll do is not let
them hire street. Oh my goodness.

38
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:46,110
Make him get up Max and knocked
him out. Oh, what heart? Heart.

39
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,950
Heart is right heart by Aldo
to survive this. He's too

40
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:55,770
his Jujitsu's but side controls.
Look at this live. Oh Shit.

41
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,920
So battered man.
Oh.

42
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,440
Oh my goodness.

43
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:12,000
No more burger joints. Oh fuck man. Dude.
He might, you never know what the fuck

44
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:15,903
man

45
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,090
tried to sneak out the back door when
he's going to try and do is use. Oh,

46
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,870
he's got it. Oh my God.
Oh my God. Oh my God.

47
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,423
Move.

48
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,200
This is hurting a lot of time.
Oh my God.

49
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,840
What's rough is that? Oh,
that's a big job. He knows
what he's doing. Oh, head arms

50
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,330
arm's the wrong spot.
Oh,

51
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,530
if he just pours it on right now, he's
going to stop. Come on. No, no, no,

52
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,050
no. Oh my goodness. He's
defending. Oh my goodness.

53
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,100
Hey, cut me up. Cover up now. What? Now?
What? That's it. They can assess it.

54
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,770
He's going to say defend yourself.
Defend your notes. He saying I'm good.

55
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,410
My Rep didn't hear that last fight.

56
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,990
Oh,
oh.

57
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,500
Oh my God.
Holy Shit.

58
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,960
Hawaii finally got to the rural champ.

59
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,640
God Damn fucking Hawaii Shit.
Max Holloway.

60
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,260
You know what man?
Aldo,

61
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,600
he's shaking his head because he still
wanted to be able to fight and it's a

62
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:48,650
reference call to stop the fight and
he's very upset about that. He was stuck,

63
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,450
but man, it seemed legit to
me. That was a legit stoppage.

64
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:58,220
It seemed legit to me.
Oh, you know it's legit.

65
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:03,020
Eddie had criminal use. Legit.
Legit, right? Yeah, I do. Yeah,

66
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:08,190
I would. I would imagine. I like this.

67
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,780
I liked this. I liked it. That
big John. Let it go. That long

68
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:18,890
fight change. You rarely see he took a
beating for like two minutes straight.

69
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:23,230
Yup. Yup. Came back, man. You got
tagged. It's just sad. That white girl.

70
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,430
It's so hard, man. She sees what he goes
through, man. What an incredible fight.

71
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:35,620
Oh, let him jump in the
fucking flag. Flag, man. No.

72
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,840
There's this family that flew all the
way from Hawaii. Guys chasing my ma.

73
00:05:38,841 --> 00:05:41,750
Where's the rock? What the
fuck? Yeah. Hurry up man.

74
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:46,780
You got a world champion in Hawaii.
Cleveland. We got a world champ.

75
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,990
Cleveland. We got weld
chesty pay. That's right.

76
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:55,580
That's one of my all time favorite. A guy
who just won the title things is steep.

77
00:05:55,581 --> 00:05:58,610
Meo Chick did Cleveland's,
what is it about his kitchen situation?

78
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,950
He ran out onto the cage. He couldn't
believe it. After he knocked out,

79
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,260
we got a wheelchair.
Slash.

80
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,630
Kelly. Right? You like him? You like
machine gun Kelly? I don't want to

81
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,400
say something nice or say
nothing at all. Oh, hey, listen.

82
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,030
There's a serious movement in Cleveland.
Yeah, well listen, Cleveland is a,

83
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,860
I had a great fucking time.

84
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:24,430
We did the UFC in Cleveland just
a little while ago and I did it.

85
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:29,240
I did a show there in Cleveland.
I had a fucking great time,
man. They're fun, Dude.

86
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:33,400
That clip that city's coming back to life.
Hawaii Whitney's lucky come about.

87
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:38,000
Let's talk about, look at
this big bang. Boom. Come on.

88
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:42,020
Sign drops him with that right hand.
Nothing fancy. Is it the one to the one,

89
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:45,470
two beautiful timing though, man.
[inaudible] look at this. Look at that.

90
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:50,730
Oh my timing with that right hand
is perfection. He's on top of them.

91
00:06:50,731 --> 00:06:51,770
Drop some bombs on them.

92
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,610
There was a couple of times in the fight
where it looks like it looked like Aldo

93
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:59,840
went out, put his will, his will and
his need to fucking get through this.

94
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,710
Like right there, Bang. Come
on man. Is to be Josie Aldo.

95
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:08,450
Just once in a kind of freak fight
with Conor to beat him like this.

96
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,850
I mean Max Holloway beat
the shit out of him.

97
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,070
He beat him in a way that
no one's ever beat him.

98
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:17,300
Blessed and kept going to him and he beat
them in a way that no one's ever beat

99
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:19,430
him.
Connor only beat him cause he caught him.

100
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,660
Max Holloway beat him down and beat him.
US beat him down.

101
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,760
He's got through the gauntlet.

102
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:30,790
How big is that tall or we can be Hawaii
and fighting his fucking shy and I've

103
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:33,470
been singing Hasees, Bj
Penn, and own that island.

104
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,150
I've been singing that kids
praises for a long time. He is,

105
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,110
came into the UFC super
for Josie to oh yeah.

106
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,170
Who's the guy in the background
holding that devastated like it's his,

107
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,330
it's the worst devastation. Devastated to
lose though, don't they? Yeah. Hey Man.

108
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,230
Hey Man. It is what it did.
Did a great job. He's a great
fighter. It is what it is.

109
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,700
This is fighting and people win and
people lose. And the the sport ultimately,

110
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,400
it depends upon these sort of fights.

111
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:06,730
It depends upon these all time greats
like Aldo facing some guy who's got the

112
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:11,240
solution to what that guy presents. Yup.
And that's what although did tonight.

113
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,691
How do you mean?

114
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:15,260
He went out there with all
of his championship medal
and he laid it all on the

115
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:15,531
line.

116
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:20,280
He fought his best and his puzzle
got solved by the new breed of,

117
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,540
let's hear, let's hear what
he has. It's condominium.

118
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,800
Both of these guys give us some
volume cause I know Harvey pause guys,

119
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:30,500
they beat him with a torn ACL at a
title wrapped around it a long time ago.

120
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,610
Still is incredible

121
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:40,350
diplomas or altering my lord and
savior. Jesus Christ. Second. Oh,

122
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,880
I got to love his son at home.

123
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:47,450
Maybe you got another know
on Baby Josh Holloway.

124
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:53,400
Great man. I love it. Yeah. George Rush.
Saint Pierre Inspired Nasser. No. Nah.

125
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,020
He's Hawaiian love over here on

126
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:59,730
the stand. You, you're on
your phone called you man.

127
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:05,090
I love you guys. But it made it made
you think I got any decisions exclusive.

128
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,790
No Feeder

129
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,280
John. Powerful. Shout out to Brazil.
Always a good move. Yeah, but they're,

130
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,840
they're pulling them. Well,
of course they're booing them.

131
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,910
They feel like the fight shouldn't have
been stopped because their guy got beat.

132
00:09:14,911 --> 00:09:15,530
You're smarter than that.

133
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:19,690
Brazil started a little slow tonight
and round three when you got your slow

134
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,500
less. Why you gotta bring up, Oh shit.

135
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,750
Sarah,
where's my 50 kids?

136
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:45,010
Well, has 50 kids. You see
all the decision, right? Bang.

137
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,110
I'm a smart QC. Hawaii. Wow. That's
Tom UFC, Hawaii with very tough shit.

138
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,450
I don't know.
I don't travel overseas,

139
00:09:52,451 --> 00:09:55,300
but I will fucking fly
to Hawaii in a heartbeat.

140
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,040
I will that make it happen.

141
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:08,780
Okay.
