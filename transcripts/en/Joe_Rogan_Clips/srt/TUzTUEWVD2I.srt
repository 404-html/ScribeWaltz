1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,530
Dumb. And then one video, Carlos Photo
photo folder, I think his name was,

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,600
he was fighting someone in Seattle,
in front of cops,

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,400
like some guy agreed to fight him.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,860
And then you see right away
what a terrible idea it is.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,010
Many leg kicks the guy and the guy's got
this look on his face like, oh my God,

6
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:20,520
you actually know how to fight. He beats
the shit out of this guy. Phoenix Jones.

7
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:23,160
Yeah, that's what he's called
himself. Phoenix. Look how he dressed,

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,830
but watch this video of it. He can see it
on that one too. This is exactly, yeah,

9
00:00:26,831 --> 00:00:29,220
yeah, yeah. So the guys like folk,

10
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,860
you'll fucking kick your ass and
this is in front of the cops.

11
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:35,350
It's like fuck you. And he's like, you
know, you think you're gonna fuck get,

12
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,680
and he's wearing the superhero costume
on. And he's like, give me some vital.

13
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,540
He's telling the backup, you guys
walking towards the university way.

14
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,540
You're 47 cause wearing an orange liqueur.

15
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,650
Come see you see him wearing
that outfit. Yes. And you think,

16
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,830
oh I can kick this guy's ass for sure.
This guy's a clown. Fucking cosplay.

17
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:02,910
Dork. Yeah, a little bit, but watch
that. Skip ahead. It's like, okay.

18
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,243
Yeah.

19
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,650
So the guy wouldn't stop badgering him
and then finally in front of the cops,

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,330
they agreed to let these dudes Duke it
out. Holy Shit. That's it right there.

21
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,920
Let it go there. Watch this. Oh, that's
when you know you made a mistake.

22
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:23,320
The first leg moving around,
and again,

23
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,130
you got a useless,
and he's turning to kick too.

24
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:35,080
He jabbed him to the body. Yeah.
You fucked up. Wow. Yeah. God,

25
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,290
this guy's life style.

26
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,140
That third leg done that
third leg gigs a real problem.

27
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:44,743
Okay.

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,490
Oh, the fourth leg kick. Yeah. Yup.

29
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,793
Oh,

30
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,170
that guy is basically hopping around
on one leg. Oh No. Now it's a beating.

31
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,530
That's it. That's a
wrap. Yup. That's right.

32
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,580
He's combat. You're right. Yeah.

33
00:02:00,581 --> 00:02:05,581
It's a mutual combat law and cops are
standing by watching this guy gate

34
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:07,900
brained. Yeah. That's
what's crazy is like,

35
00:02:07,901 --> 00:02:11,110
it's very irresponsible for
the cops because that's not
a good fighting surface.

36
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,600
Yeah. Yeah. You can get out. I usually
have a padded area they set aside.
