1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,530
Um, my thought is I'm in negotiation
or in discussions right now,

2
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:05,730
and I talked to you about this too,

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,760
about building an APP and what I want to
do with the APP is have a set amount of

4
00:00:10,951 --> 00:00:13,200
money that you pay per month.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,880
If you want to sign up for the APP and
you get the podcast with no ads, right?

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,290
So you could either get it from iTunes
or whatever you Google play or Google

7
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:25,560
podcast or you can get it from the APP.
And if you get it from the APP,

8
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:29,640
you pay x amount per month and you get
the podcast with zero ads and it'll

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,460
stream live. I'm going to figure out
how to, when to do both of those things.

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,650
My thought going into advertising when
I first, when I first did the podcast,

11
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:41,100
I've been doing the podcast now for nine
years and when I first started doing it,

12
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,770
there was no ads for the longest time.
It just costs money.

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,620
It costs money to for bandwidth,
it costs money to put it.

14
00:00:46,621 --> 00:00:49,050
But I was doing it for fun and
I didn't care and I had my life,

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,580
my revenue was coming from other
sources. Um, a few years ago, uh,

16
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:57,450
I decided what I was going to
do was cause it was getting ad.

17
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,840
The first ad requests was the
Facebook was a the fleshlight rather.

18
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:02,450
And you were the first person to request,

19
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,910
I killed them to not have the
flashlight on your podcast.

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,450
The first podcast that
we did can prima Donna

21
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,900
allows it made sense. I mean they
were disgusting. ADDS to, I mean we,

22
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,580
we would get ridiculous and, and
be really silly. And those ads,

23
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:18,870
it was just the juxtaposition.
I just,

24
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:21,390
just knowing that the Mike
would go hot and then, you know,

25
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:23,940
15 seconds before he was still
be ringing in their ears.

26
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,220
If you want to jack off
with this fantastic device,

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,420
here's Sam Harris neuroscientists,
but moral philosopher,

28
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,160
the fleshlight experience,

29
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:36,510
some pretty significant
positive impact from that.

30
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,440
I mean their business went through the
roof because of the podcast. I mean,

31
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:43,560
they're really sold a shit load of
flashlights where they told me like some

32
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:47,550
ungodly number, like 50% of
the flashlights they were
selling was codeword Rogan.

33
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:54,330
I don't want a picture too much of the
armies of people using their product,

34
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:54,690
you know,

35
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:59,690
so word got around and then as the
podcast space started expanding,

36
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:05,001
then advertisers tentatively we're dipping
their toe in my philosophy and it's

37
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:10,290
still holds like 2006 or seven or Jamie,

38
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:16,060
it's 2012. I wasn't, the
first time I was on here,

39
00:02:16,061 --> 00:02:18,120
it was 2011.
Wow.

40
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,710
[inaudible] nine 10 was all right.
You were probably on before. Yeah,

41
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:24,840
you're probably on around 2010 or 11.

42
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:28,240
There was no other ads other
than the flashlight with you. Um,

43
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,080
and then the fleshlight dropped off
when we started asking for more money.

44
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:32,850
They are like, oh, I think we
hit the point of no return.

45
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,600
But my philosophy getting
into advertisement was, uh,

46
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,660
I'm going to do whatever the fuck I
want to do 100% and have no impact

47
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,710
whatsoever on the content of my podcasts.

48
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:51,240
Like whatever advertisers that I
choose, whatever advertisers that, uh,

49
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,580
I make deals with,

50
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,910
they have to understand that there's
no way I'm changing the content of the

51
00:02:56,911 --> 00:03:00,370
podcast. And if I lose them,
I lose them. I don't care.

52
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,650
And that was the thought process going in.

53
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,040
So I never hit up a snag like this
cash App Jack Dorsey thing before where

54
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:13,351
people think that the reason why I was
easy with him was because of the fact

55
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:18,490
that he sponsors the podcast. It's
a very obvious conflict of interest,

56
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,460
but I, but people have to realize that
if they churn out off your podcast,

57
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:29,461
you've got just an endless number of
advertisers waiting in the cash out.

58
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:33,410
Not a very logical opponent is just
one way of looking at it that they,

59
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,160
they buy a lot of ads.
They do buy a lot of ads.

60
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,630
We do have a good relationship with them,

61
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:42,940
but I don't need them if they went away.
I have too many ads.

62
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,640
And that sounds gross to say,
but it is a fact.

63
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,790
I have many more ads than
I have spots for ads.

64
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,050
So if they went away would not hurt me
at all financially because I put a limit

65
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:54,760
on how many ads I do per podcast.

66
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:59,240
I also don't ever interrupt a podcast
with an ad. I don't do that. Right.

67
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,970
And because I don't do that,
that costs me money.

68
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:06,270
But I just feel like the experience of
listening to a podcast unbroken is so

69
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:10,570
much better than listening to a podcast.

70
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:13,120
We'll be right back with this
word from Casper mattresses.

71
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:17,080
You know it just feels gross. But
in the beginning I'm like, look,

72
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:21,310
you know where it is, you can fast
forward but maybe you're into this stuff.

73
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:24,200
Maybe you need stamps.com may,
maybe whatever the fuck you need the,

74
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,320
those are the ads.
They pay a lot of money.

75
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,110
I'm going to take that money and I'm
going to do whatever the fuck I want.

76
00:04:29,111 --> 00:04:30,580
And if these guys decide,

77
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,690
oh you smoke pot or you're
too controversial or you
talk about this or talk

78
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,730
about that, we're going to drop you. Okay.

79
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,860
That's my philosophy and I've lost
ads. I've lost sponsors. Okay,

80
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,040
I don't care. But if I lost the
cash APP cause it was too hot,

81
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:49,240
hard on Jack Dorsey or Jack Dorsey
comes back and I'm too hard on him in

82
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:53,170
grilling him about these people that
have been censored. I hope he doesn't,

83
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,530
but I like him. He's nice guy. I want to
know what the fuck's going on there. I,

84
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:59,020
in fact,
I'm having Tim Pool come on tomorrow.

85
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:02,830
10 pools and investigative journalists,
independent journalist who was a,

86
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:07,870
used to be with vice and he knows a lot
about the censorship issue with youtube

87
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,580
or with a, with a Twitter rather. And
he knows about youtube as well, but uh,

88
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:16,750
with whose censored and why, who
is removed, who's been d platform,

89
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,700
why they'd been d platform and where the
inconsistencies and you know, where, why,

90
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,810
why is it skewing so heavily,
right. Where the, the,

91
00:05:24,811 --> 00:05:27,070
the people on the right are the ones
who are getting banned and the people on

92
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:29,440
the left are getting away with a lot
of crazy shit. So we're going to,

93
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,790
we're going to get into
the weeds with that.

94
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,720
And if the cash APP hears that and
they decided to drop me as a sponsor,

95
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,100
I don't care. I really don't care. This
is a major source of income for me,

96
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:42,760
but it's only one source is one of the
things that being a standup comedian,

97
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,510
working for the UFC and having a podcast
and then have a podcast with ads on

98
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:51,130
Youtube and, and having ads that
are on the regular podcast itself.

99
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,120
I'm free in a sense too.
I have plenty of money.

100
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,460
It's not whether or not I'm starving
or worry about paying my bills.

101
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,890
I'm free to do whatever I want to do.

102
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,380
Well also I should be
clear like I don't think,

103
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:07,340
because this can sound
totally sanctimonious and, and
it's not intended that way.

104
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,700
I don't think my scruples
around at reading it as on
my podcast apply to you or

105
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:18,320
Tim Ferriss or many other people.
I mean like Tim is the ultimate example.

106
00:06:18,321 --> 00:06:23,321
Tim is somebody who's brand on some level
is what I'm gonna do is I'm going to

107
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:27,410
go out there and find the best
shit in the world, the best shirts,

108
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:30,110
the best workout equipment through us.
And I'm going to tell you about it.

109
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,630
So I want to know what Tim
has mount, right? So if Tim,

110
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:37,631
if Tim is reading an ad for something
that is totally brand convergent for him

111
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,790
and I think you're very much in a similar
situation if you're talking about on

112
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,610
it or whatever it is and it's your
own you own part of on it. Right?

113
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,600
So it's like I should also be clear that
I say no to a lot of ads that I don't

114
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:51,170
want. Like there was one, there was
a Uber for babysitting. I was like,

115
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,630
get the fuck out of here.
What are you crazy?

116
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:56,740
You actually said that got
recommended to me by somebody. But uh,

117
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,240
it sounds like it sounds, it sounds
like sounds like craigslist for babies.

118
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:01,130
It sounds like a disaster
waiting to happen.

119
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,070
There has a been a few that I've
said no to like quite a few.

120
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,140
Some of them that are just boring.
I'm like,

121
00:07:06,141 --> 00:07:08,120
I'm not reading that are not selling that,
that's stupid.

122
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:12,710
But also you're a comic who can send
up ads. I mean, so like, I mean,

123
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:16,000
I think bill bird does this where he kind
of trashes the ad as he's reading it.

124
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:20,090
And because of that he lost nature box
cause he told people to go eat apples.

125
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,430
Really? He's like, go eat a
fucking apple. So it's, I mean,

126
00:07:25,431 --> 00:07:26,700
that's totally like,
and that,

127
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,070
that's something that's a tool you have
in your wheel house that has a affects

128
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,910
down the list.
Like it's,

129
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:36,800
it's one reason why you can stream
live without really worrying about it.

130
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,210
And I, I feel, I can't like, so it's
like, I mean, at the end of the day,

131
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:45,620
like if things go completely haywire
on your podcast, you can say, listen,

132
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:48,020
I'm a fucking comic. What do I
know? Right. Like you can just,

133
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,940
you can just pull the rip
cord. Yes. And you're fine.
Right, right. I can't do that.

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,600
Right. Like, so like you
can't say I'm a moral I, yeah.

135
00:07:55,601 --> 00:08:00,350
So I can't say that I say that
all the time. So I mean, I can,

136
00:08:00,351 --> 00:08:02,750
and there's certain circumstances
where I should, but if like,

137
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,010
I should avoid those circumstances.
Right.
