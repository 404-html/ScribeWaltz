1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,110
The joe rogan experience.
Yeah. I was looking at the,

2
00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:09,050
like the map of the way we fly. We fly
so we can't see it the entire way. Yeah.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,540
Which is bullshit. Yeah. Plus it
was cloudy, which is also bullshit.

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,660
That would've been cool. I even asked the
guy, I'm like, which way do we go? Yeah.

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,680
That would be fucking awesome if
it flew over that thing. Yeah. Ooh,

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,600
fuck. Living on a volcano
though, man. Good place to
visit though is beautiful. Oh,

7
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,630
stunning. Yeah. Great. And where we were,

8
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:34,920
we were on the nine and the
nine is an interesting place.

9
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,380
3000 people, 20,000 deer. Right. And,

10
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,110
and so you do the math, you think,
hey, this is going to be gravy. Dare.

11
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:47,520
It is way more deer than
people. But God, it was,

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,580
it's tough. It's tough
hunting. Hunting for sure.

13
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,170
Well this is one of the best examples,
um,

14
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,060
of if you want to make an argument for
hunting like this in certain situations,

15
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:01,860
this is probably the best example.

16
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,890
You must control the population of these
animals. They don't have any predators.

17
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:09,780
And they evolved around tigers. They
come from India. So these axis deer,

18
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:14,520
they were a gift from a Hong Kong
to King Kamehameha the fifth.

19
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:19,830
I saw your history lesson and 1860 and
I was getting it all into it today and I

20
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:23,880
want to make my post about is
awesome. Um, so they, what did they,

21
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,540
what was the number that they shoot?
How many did they should a week just to,

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,310
just to feed people and control the
population had 1500 but not a week was it?

23
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:36,360
No, I think it was 30 a day. Oh, okay.
Yeah, there was saying the shoot 30 a day.

24
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,080
Right, because they have
to go at night. Yup.

25
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:43,590
What's night night vision scopes and
shoot dose. Yeah. Just to take 'em out,

26
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:48,240
just to take him out. So many deer.
When we were there at night, um, we got,

27
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,720
first of all we got, I got
super lucky. Thanks to you, you,

28
00:01:51,721 --> 00:01:55,800
you let me take that deer. But when
white one we landed, we went to Scout,

29
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,300
we got out of the car,

30
00:01:57,301 --> 00:02:02,301
we went and looked around and within
five minutes we saw a buck feeding in a,

31
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,000
in a doable spot.
Not creeped in,

32
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:10,020
it was total it w w it just gives you a
distorted perception of your chances of

33
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:14,940
success. Yeah, because for the next five
days I got nothing until the last day,

34
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,080
but in 15 minutes I got the first deer.
But when you get there,

35
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,330
you realize how switched on these things.

36
00:02:22,331 --> 00:02:27,030
So like there's, there's nothing
like these things. It's a, you know,

37
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:31,740
I've hunted in Africa and in the antelope
there are pretty quick also just like

38
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:36,270
that, but just because of lions and
hyenas and yeah, just, just super jumpy,

39
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,780
twitchy. But these deers,
very similar. Just quick,

40
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,940
when we were leaving that night when you,

41
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:44,610
and me and Adam were in the truck and
we're leaving and we turned the lights on

42
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:49,030
the truck and you could see hundreds
of deer in front of us. Yeah.

43
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,220
It was the craziest,

44
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,530
like it was like a crowd being led out
of a concert or something like that or

45
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,373
basketball games,

46
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,020
basketball games over cause it is just
that they're coming out of the, yeah,

47
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:04,120
crossing the road into the open field
where we'd been hunting and it's just

48
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,320
hundreds. You can't imagine if you haven't
been there. You can imagine if you,

49
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,490
if you move there or if you
just went there for a few
days, you'd kind of get it.

50
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:14,470
You'd be like, okay, what do
you do about these things?

51
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,880
Well you can't give them birth control.
I mean they eat grass.

52
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,940
So like how are you going to stop
them from breeding? You're not,

53
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,580
so what are you going to do? Are you
going to introduce tigers to Lanai?

54
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,880
That would be cool. There may be the
only way to do it other than hunters.

55
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,700
And they're going to start eating
people just hunting. And it's,

56
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,020
it's such a destination for
just getting good deer meat.

57
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,080
And I was thinking about it too,
that stretch.

58
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:40,360
Where are those hundreds of deer
cross the highway? You know, that's,

59
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:45,280
I mean it's a straight as can be.
You can see, I mean great visibility,

60
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,840
but the speed limit is 35.

61
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,750
I think it's because deer are always
jumped out in front of cars there.

62
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,540
People would be dying. So it's, it
seems like, why is it 35? This is like,

63
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,220
you should be 70, but so many deer. I
think it's also because they're like,

64
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:05,110
where are you going? Yeah, slow down.
There's no hurry. What's the hurry man?

65
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,420
Relax. I mean 3000 people on the island.
Maybe that, yeah, that's part of it too.

66
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,110
That island. So relax and the people
are so friendly. I was an awesome,

67
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,910
awesome place. It was a,
um, anytime I go on a hunt,

68
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:23,050
I mean I'm thankful for the experience
and, and for seeing the animals,

69
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:27,400
but also meeting the people, you
know, Alec, Bob, the butcher.

70
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,900
Um, they're just like these
people that are ingrained in your,

71
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,640
in your memory and you know,
that's it.

72
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:38,140
That's such a special part of the trip
also. Yeah. The experience is very,

73
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:43,150
very unusual because there's really
not a place like that that I know of

74
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:48,151
anywhere on the planet that's just a
small island with a small population of

75
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:52,510
people and a massive population of the
most delicious animals in the world.

76
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,150
And even though there's so many of them.
Good fucking luck getting one. Yeah.

77
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,610
We had our friend Ben O'brien,
he went home empty handed.

78
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:05,170
He was so one of us in a group
of very experienced hunters.

79
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,370
I mean other than me, everybody in that
group is super, super experienced. Yeah.

80
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,970
You know,
and still is no cake walk.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,860
These things are switched on and now dodge
arrows like during the matrix. I mean,

82
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:21,310
it's crazy. It's a, there's no
gimmie's. No, I mean it's a,

83
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,970
you can do everything right. You
can, you can think in your head.

84
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:29,620
While I travel all the way here, I'm, I'm
here to hunt. I need to take meat home.

85
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,250
It doesn't matter those deer,
there's no gimmie's.

86
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,660
They're trying to stay alive and
they know what's up. They get hunted.

87
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,920
I don't know if it's every day because
when their, when their antlers fall off,

88
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,480
you know the bucks probably are hunted,

89
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,550
but because they're
killing doe is at night.

90
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,490
They're hunted most days out of the year.

91
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,760
So they are as well as wired as it
can be. I mean, because they're,

92
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:57,680
they're used to being pursued. Yeah. It's
different than say like white tail deer,

93
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,920
whitetail deer seem to kind of know
when hunting season comes around. Yeah.

94
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,710
Like when they're velvet drops off and
they rub their velvet off and then the

95
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,600
females start coming into season,

96
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,110
that's when they get fucking sketchy and
nervous because they know that guns are

97
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:14,920
going to be going off from, the arrows
are going to be flying their way. Right.

98
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,350
But you catch them during the summer.
They're just kind of chilling. Yeah.

99
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,220
These things are never challenged polar
in the winter after season, they're just,

100
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:27,430
they're more focused on food and putting
on some weight to to make it through

101
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:31,970
the winter. So other than hunting season,
they are more chill. But these things,

102
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:33,290
I don't think they ever get a day off.

103
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,500
They don't get a day off and they can't
give him a day off because if they just,

104
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,120
if everybody said, hey man, this
just need these animals and then man,

105
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,420
if they did, they would all die either
of starvation or they would die.

106
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,280
They had to eradicate the goat population
on the island because people brought

107
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:53,090
goats there and the goats literally had
decimated the vegetation to the point

108
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:56,870
where the island started going into
a drought. I don't understand this,

109
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,620
but somehow or another, if you
eat all of the vegetation, the,

110
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:05,390
the rain stops falling in certain areas
where there's a lack of participate,

111
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:10,391
precipitation or condensation doesn't
gather because there's no no leaves to

112
00:07:10,761 --> 00:07:12,320
catch capture it.

113
00:07:12,321 --> 00:07:15,800
Or one of the ladies who lived there
was explaining it to me why they had to

114
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:18,710
kill all the goats. Oh, I see. And
she was like, trees were dying,

115
00:07:18,711 --> 00:07:23,000
everything was dying. And they're in
the process right now of a, in Maui,

116
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,120
they have this gigantic area that they
are trying to eradicate deer from and

117
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:33,260
they want to fence it in to let the
forest regrow because the forest doesn't

118
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:34,970
have a chance to regrow with,
again,

119
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:38,360
same animal access deer because they
just eat all the little baby trees.

120
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,770
It has a little trees are coming up.

121
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:41,810
They just chew those fuckers
up and that's what they eat.

122
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:45,470
They shoots and they want the new
browse. Yeah, yeah. New Growth. Yeah.

123
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:54,650
Okay.
