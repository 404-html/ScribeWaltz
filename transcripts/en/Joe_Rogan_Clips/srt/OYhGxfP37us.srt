1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,380
Oh, he's unique. What is
finding Hitler all about? Um,

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,440
this is the show that you're on and it's
on a and e, is that what's on? Yeah,

3
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:08,610
Amy is the parent network.

4
00:00:08,611 --> 00:00:13,611
It airs on history channel and we just
had our third season that just finished

5
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:18,630
airing. What's the thought process
behind this? This is this, is it legit?

6
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,660
Cause a lot of people are like finding
Hitler. Get the fuck out of here.

7
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:26,160
They found Hitler. He died. Yeah. I
mean not really. We don't know. Right.

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,210
That that's the, that's the, I mean this
isn't like ancient aliens. This is whee.

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,300
They declassified a bunch of documents.
They,

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:38,330
both the Israelis and the British and
the Germans and Americans in the past 20

11
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:41,640
years have been consistently
declassified documents.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,650
And there were a bunch of specifically
FBI documents that we were spending

13
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,190
millions and millions of dollars actively
searching for Hitler after the war.

14
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:55,590
As was, yeah. Like millions of dollars.
Like Hoover was like, no, no, no, no.

15
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,480
Send more FBI agents to South
America and to North Africa.

16
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,350
Go to the Canary Islands,
go to Spain.

17
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,690
Trying to find out where this guy went.

18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,580
Songs of real FBI
documents with real leads,

19
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:13,050
with real informants,

20
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,170
some hand or some first I accounts
saying that they physical.

21
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:22,020
So anyways,
that's the show is us trying to find out,

22
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:25,740
sift through reality and um,

23
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,760
the fiction of the, the allure, the mist,

24
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,850
the mystery of that asshole.
So what's the official story?

25
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:35,820
The official story is that he
killed himself, right? Yep. Yeah.

26
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,880
Killed himself in the bunker
with David Braun. Yup.

27
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,110
And is there any photographic
evidence of his death or anything?

28
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,730
So what the Russians got the
body and they got his school.

29
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,580
Um,
and when they brought it back to Moscow,

30
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,640
nobody has ever been able to independently
verify who and what this body is.

31
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,710
They let one genetic tests occur and the
body and with a bullet holes that they

32
00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:07,860
said was Hitler and have said, and
that's the narrative. That's a story.

33
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:11,700
That's the all the eye witness accounts
that are in even in the vicinity of

34
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,620
collaborating with each other and
cooperating each other's testimony.

35
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,790
Like the closest version, cause none
of it seems to be very accurate.

36
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,920
Is that okay, here's Hitler skull.
And when they did the genetic testing,

37
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:29,070
it's that of a 35 year
old woman. So like, oh,

38
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,960
well this isn't Hitler,

39
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,060
but they've said for the past 80
years that this is Hitler. So,

40
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,830
okay, first before we start
throwing stones at Russia,

41
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,690
let's go back to 1945
April, um, Ma in Berlin,

42
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,260
you have the allies coming in,
wrecking shop, dropping bombs,

43
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:50,130
blowing everything up.

44
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:52,800
They can in every single which way you
have the Russians coming in from the

45
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:56,550
opposite direction. They don't even have
enough guns to arm all their soldiers.

46
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,070
So if they have 200 guys or 200,000 guys,

47
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,470
they have 100,000 guns at the guy in front
of you dies. You just pick up his gun.

48
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,730
That's what's happening in
April of 1945 in Berlin.

49
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,210
So the noose is tightening.
There is no,

50
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,040
I mean it is chaos and arche
pandemonium. This, I mean you couldn't,

51
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,060
this is hell on earth is Berlin, 1945. So,

52
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:23,890
I don't know if you could
get a real story, a real,

53
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,710
the way that we do it now,
where we have, you know,

54
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:31,330
this forensic experts that come in and
document everything and we'd look at all

55
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:34,630
the different testimonies say this
is this exactly how, it's just not,

56
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:39,040
it's not CSI. This is
1945 Berlin. It's crazy.

57
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,860
So I don't know.
There's,

58
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,220
there was no like absolute proof

59
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,800
and a lot of Nazis did escape
and go to South America.

60
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,570
The majority of anyone with power,

61
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,080
the Nuremberg trials
were not a witch hunt,

62
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:00,310
but it was to close a chapter so we can
start moving forward with communism.

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,470
That's what it was.
The threat of fascism,

64
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:08,800
the threat of Hitler, the, the
threat of killing all the Jews,

65
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:12,820
the threat of world domination
by the Nazis that threat's gone.

66
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,880
What's the next threat? Tommy
does this communism, right?

67
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,990
So that had to be a closed chapter
of our history so we could focus our

68
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:24,070
resources and our efforts to what
inevitably was going to, I mean,

69
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,220
the wall goes up. We have east
and West Berlin, you know,

70
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:30,280
we're already looking at Korea. I mean
this, this happens almost overnight,

71
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,010
very quickly. No one
patents like no, no homies.

72
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,310
We need to go all the way to Matt Moscow.
This is not the end of our war.

73
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,240
And we didn't listen to him.
Um, we then had been, you know,

74
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,000
fighting communism for the past 75 years.

75
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,960
So the ones with power
that went to South America,

76
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:50,750
I know a bunch of them went to
Argentina. Uh, they think, uh,

77
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:54,370
they went to Honduras and
a few other places where,

78
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:58,480
where do they think they wound up?
So what you had in South America,

79
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,350
both Chile and Argentina back to
back had fascist receipt regimes.

80
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:07,510
You had a person who was part of the
Nazi party starting all the way back into

81
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:10,000
the mid thirties.
He's the president of Argentina.

82
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:15,360
So the Red Cross, um, they
were facilitating that.

83
00:05:15,361 --> 00:05:18,640
There was about three different rat
lines that guys were able to successfully

84
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:22,170
get out of Europe into South America.
Um,

85
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,190
and these are, there's no question
that we're talking thousands,

86
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:31,090
if not tens of thousands of high ranking
Nazis made it there. Tens of thousands,

87
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:34,210
tens of thousands.
And I'm not talking like little soldiers.

88
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:39,450
I'm talking high ranking Nazis officer's
got guys like Joseph Mengele and Adolf

89
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:40,210
Eichmann.

90
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,020
I mean these are the most disgusting
despicable humans to exist at the time.

91
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,400
If Hill,
if Hitler is dead,

92
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,020
Joseph Mengele is the guy that would
take syringes full of blue ink and inject

93
00:05:50,021 --> 00:05:53,200
them and you have blue eyes,
Joe, or you have brown eyes.

94
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,310
Let me see if I can make them blue.
Oh Wow.

95
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,550
And then take twins and start torturing
them to see if one would feel the pain.

96
00:05:58,551 --> 00:05:59,540
That's Josef Mengele.

97
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,310
I mean that's the guy that then
in South America was helping, um,

98
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,890
high ranking Argentinians have
abortions and he set up, um,

99
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,410
have you seen the movie Colonia
about Koininia, dignity dad,

100
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,740
which is that if you're
listening right now,

101
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,500
almost warn you not to
Google it because it is,

102
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,370
it was a torture camp that
was started by Joseph Shafer,

103
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,190
a Nazi and Josef Mengele,
the,

104
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:31,210
the doctor of death that escaped
trial in Nuremberg and made it,

105
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,820
um,
at the behest of Parone into Argentina.

106
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:38,870
He set up the hospital at Colonia Dignan
Dad, which was another safe house,

107
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:43,570
safe haven for more Nazis
in South America. Um,

108
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:47,680
go to my air and David and Ben
Gurion, the presidents of Israel, um,

109
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,943
they,

110
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,460
they took the gloves off and they were
just sending an assassin's to try and

111
00:06:52,461 --> 00:06:54,210
find these people and killed them.
Um,

112
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:59,260
but what you got in South America
were isolated German only communities.

113
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,960
You could go into Bariloche,
Argentina, and you know, I'd be like,

114
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,900
what will it is Migos and they
were like Guten Morgen Oh yeah,

115
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,870
good morning. Yeah.
Sorry. It's 2017. Right?

116
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,120
I thought we spoke Spanish here in 2017
you were there and they were speaking

117
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:20,930
German. Yeah. Whoa. Why
I'm, I don't look very,

118
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,490
I might look more European than I do show
is just them seeing me walking on the

119
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:30,350
street and be like, wow. And
there's tons of communities. I mean,

120
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,170
if you go to Colonia Dicta Dad,
which is now called via Bavaria,

121
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,720
the Bavarian village,

122
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,460
it is a only German wow.
In the center of Chile,

123
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:45,410
in the mountains of Chile.
Like you, there's no Spanish
beans being spoken there.

124
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:49,550
It is exclusively German and
these are descendants of Nazis.

125
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,370
Powerful Nazis. Holy Shit. And
this is going on right now. Yeah.

126
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:58,940
Yeah. What are these communities like?
I mean, what's their ideology or they,

127
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:04,400
I mean, they're pretty white. Yeah.
What are they like? I mean, are they,

128
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:09,970
do they espouse Nazi values are
not openly so colonia dignity dad?

129
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,230
Uh, if you look at the second
generation, there's a bunch of,

130
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:20,860
so it was a huge problem for Chile that
they tried to hide for years and they

131
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:27,371
got so much power from the torturing
that they did at Colonia dicta dad on a

132
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:28,870
whole bunch of other PR,

133
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:33,890
high ranking South American dictators
that they're almost untouchable.

134
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,610
And this, this is, I mean,
you, you, you would blow your
mind if you look into this,

135
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:41,860
Joe, you'd, you'd love it.
But, um, the second generation,

136
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,280
the kids like the grandkids,

137
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,300
sometimes they're even more fanatical
than the original generation.

138
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:50,210
Have you ever seen this?
Where like if somebody is away from,

139
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:54,350
like when you travel abroad and it's so
cool to like to get into the culture and

140
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:57,900
get into the food and get into the,
like you're dancing this style and your,

141
00:08:57,901 --> 00:08:59,160
you love the flag and you're like,
oh,

142
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,610
I'm gonna go to a soccer game because we
don't go to soccer games in America and

143
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:05,640
I'm going go. But then maybe after
like two months, you kind of miss home,

144
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,670
you know,
and then like a year,

145
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,680
you really miss home and then 10 years,
like you really,

146
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,300
really miss home.

147
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:18,930
And you see the same thing in the United
States where it's not really a perfect

148
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:19,621
assimilation.

149
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:24,000
It's not the melting pot where you see
generations that are espousing to be more

150
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,060
like their ethnic heritage than
they are American. You know,

151
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:30,750
they're flying the Irish flag.
And like, I'm, I'm Irish, um,

152
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:36,260
what's just times a thousand with these
communities because they're exclusively

153
00:09:36,331 --> 00:09:39,930
German. Oh yeah. It's
pretty cool. Kind of weird.

154
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,370
So exclusively German and
really missing home. Yeah.

155
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:50,100
Yeah. So in the years later, the
second generations I was talking about,

156
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:50,670
um,

157
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:55,230
some of them came to the United States
and were high ranking white supremacists

158
00:09:55,231 --> 00:10:00,231
that are now in jail and
prison for their racial crimes.

159
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,420
And they came out of South America.

160
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,400
They came out of Colonia dignity
ad that came out of bear low che.

161
00:10:06,401 --> 00:10:10,620
They came out of Cordova. They came out
of Miss Joan as they came out of, yeah.

162
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,240
Wow. It's crazy. So that's
the show hunting Hitler

163
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,970
fucking amen to spread.
How many people are we talking about?

164
00:10:18,971 --> 00:10:21,760
All told in South America
that can come out of this,

165
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,860
I mean tens of thousands went there,
but how many German communities and what,

166
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:29,320
how big are they?
I mean maybe have 50 German communities.

167
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:35,560
50. How many people, if you had
to guess, a few hundred thousand.

168
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,940
Holy Shit.

169
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:42,910
Hundred thousand descendants of Nazis.
Wow.

170
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,870
Yeah.
And me,

171
00:10:43,871 --> 00:10:48,871
and it's weird when you walk into
somebody's parlor and it's like you're

172
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:52,390
stepping back in time into
Europe. Like I'm walking in, it's,

173
00:10:52,391 --> 00:10:55,420
it's 2017 and I'm walking in Buenos Aires,

174
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,550
Argentina into somebody parlor.

175
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,820
And all of the tile is European and all
of the style and all the art is very

176
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,960
German. You know, we have
like deers and you know, not,

177
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,000
not like red stags, what we're
talking German, everything,

178
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,230
things that Hiller loved. And
that's the style. That's everything.

179
00:11:17,231 --> 00:11:20,770
And then they come out and like with white
gloves, they're holding their GRANDPA,

180
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,490
their grandfathers, um,
memory box and inside of it,

181
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,100
or his war medals from,
you know,

182
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,770
when he was in the ss or when he was,

183
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:35,050
and it is the respect the,

184
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:39,270
I don't even know the right ones.
Yeah. I mean it's like, Whoa, it's the,

185
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,720
this is a gift from the pope that they're
holding their hands. White gloves. No,

186
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:47,710
I can't. First of all, Tim can't touch
it. That's, but I can appreciate it.

187
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,090
And then they tell me the story of every
single one of these things and how he

188
00:11:51,091 --> 00:11:54,940
got there and how he then went and
for the Buenos Aires news can't touch

189
00:11:54,941 --> 00:11:58,510
anything. Oh, they wouldn't know cause
I come, you'll you're dirty, dirty,

190
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:03,460
dirty American. He's to
Brown. Yeah. Fuck man.

191
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,310
So we followed the first two seasons.

192
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:10,510
It was really just unraveling the
rumors of what happened to Hitler.

193
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,740
The third season was my favorite
because I actually got to do real work.

194
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,750
They said, okay, I got it.

195
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:19,900
The second season I got to bring in
more special forces guys. Um, uh,

196
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,610
CIA targeter, Nadia, um,

197
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:28,830
who helped my unit kill Zarqawi in
2006 that this is the team that is now

198
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,940
looking at real evidence
trying to figure out, okay,

199
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,690
how did we find Bin Ladin how
do we find Secar is our county.

200
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,810
We looked at their associates and we
looked at how they move that we looked at

201
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:41,530
how the communicated,

202
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,590
we looked at what routes they were
using to get to and from places.

203
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:46,060
And then we just started
tightening the noose.

204
00:12:46,061 --> 00:12:49,420
And that's exactly what we did
in this third season was, okay,

205
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,610
let's start following the Adolf Eichmann.

206
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,340
Let's start following the Joseph main
glaze and let's start falling the scores

207
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:56,950
and skis.
Um,

208
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:02,610
Hitler's personal body guard that was a
colonel in the ss that went on to work

209
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:06,070
for everybody after the war fighting.
I mean,

210
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,770
fascists do not like communists.

211
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:14,010
So this guy was working for everybody
to include the CIA fighting fascism in

212
00:13:14,231 --> 00:13:19,231
South America or fighting communism
as a fascist in South America in the

213
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,070
fifties, sixties and seventies.
Whoa. Creepy stuff. Whoa. Yeah.

214
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,760
So,

215
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,760
so hunting hiller are there any legitimate
eye witness accounts of Hitler and

216
00:13:32,341 --> 00:13:37,330
South America or potentially
legitimate? Absolutely. Potentially.

217
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,920
Whoa. Yup. I witness counts.
I saw him get off the boat.

218
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:47,050
I saw him meet here and if it
was just some person saying it,

219
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,100
it's almost meaningless.
Right?

220
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,080
But if you look at the
context of who this person is,

221
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,380
the wealth that they have that
they shouldn't have, and I can,

222
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:01,150
can you explain how you got so rich
and two generations you're like, okay,

223
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:05,710
your grandpa got here from
Germany in 1946. That's weird.

224
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,590
Um, and he, he,

225
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:13,630
he's on a legitimate visa with an
Argentinian passport, also weird.

226
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,460
Um, and now he's a war refugee
that's now worth millions of dollars.

227
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,230
How does this, how does this work? Um, so,

228
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,800
but people,
and then this is the hard part.

229
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:32,280
People want to be connected to significant
events and especially in small rural

230
00:14:33,221 --> 00:14:38,050
areas of the world, um, developing
areas like they want, they're so nef,

231
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,530
they're so little happening. They want
to be attached to something massive.

232
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,920
And like the fact that they saw you
boat land on this beach and the pop,

233
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:49,840
the hatch opened and you know,
this,

234
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,900
these cars were there and they were doing
morse code and this guy gets off and

235
00:14:53,901 --> 00:14:56,360
he had this little
mustache. You're like, well,

236
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:01,310
for you boats can't beach. That's
not how that works. You know,

237
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:05,270
and, and, but you know what they're trying
to do. They just want to be connected.

238
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:10,130
So, and now we're removed 70
to 80 years from the facts. It,

239
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:14,990
it's has been painful to
try to use real science,

240
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,440
real investigative tools
to try to sift through

241
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,200
this lore, you know, what do
you think happened? I mean,

242
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:29,000
you've been studying this for how
long now? Three years. Yeah. You,

243
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,760
if you had to guess,
if you had like 1 million bucks,

244
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:36,560
you've got to put it on one side or
another. Did he go there? Yeah. Whoa.

245
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:40,060
I, I would say, man, it's, it's,

246
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,620
and that's the first time I've
ever said it flat out like that.

247
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,970
What would I want to say is the
way history is written is wrong.

248
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:52,160
That that's, that's clear. There's no
way that we can say he died on this day.

249
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,350
This is what happened here is his body.

250
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:58,870
And that's what his physical proof is
for sure. The woman that that head yeah,

251
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:02,040
they were saying was Hitler is
definitely not Hitler is absolutely not.

252
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:05,690
That's a fact. They don't have Hitler's
body. So then our other option was Kate,

253
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,680
is it ava? Brahms did. He just
grabbed the wrong body. Right, right.

254
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,850
So there are still descendants of,

255
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:16,270
of ava and we tried to have
them allow us to do it.

256
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:21,640
Then we tried to go through like, um, and
they can get DNA off of the skull. Yes.

257
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,630
Meat on it. It's like a tooth. Yeah. Okay.

258
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:30,620
And um, but they wouldn't consent to
it. So then we tried to do, you know,

259
00:16:30,621 --> 00:16:34,400
like were people have like the,
the tree, they're ethnic treat

260
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,590
those websites called 23 and me.
Yeah. There's like a bunch of them.

261
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,350
We tried to go that route,
but um,

262
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,750
that wouldn't consent to it. Nope. The Eva
Braun's family, they just want it gone.

263
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:52,160
They just don't want to, yeah. There are
super pissed that we even found them,

264
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,740
which was hard,
which was really hard.

265
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,130
Hold them down and get them to
spit in the bucket. Yeah. The uh,

266
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,620
I know,
I mean,

267
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,430
or pull their trash and pull stuff out of
there. Now I would totally not do that.

268
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,960
Definitely not do that. Um, but
I mean, that's how they call it.

269
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:14,570
The golden state killer, right.
Was off a fucking cigarette butts.

270
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:19,850
They got DNA off a cigarette
butt. So history's wrong. Wow.

271
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:24,530
Two for it to be black and white like
that and fuck man. And if, and again,

272
00:17:24,531 --> 00:17:28,190
if you go back to 1945,
um, we needed scientists.

273
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,590
We needed every single German electrical
engineer, mechanical engineer,

274
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:38,330
aerospace, anything. You're on the
[inaudible] program. You, do you know any,

275
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,490
we will, all of you. Because now it's a
race. It's a race. We have the bomb now.

276
00:17:43,491 --> 00:17:46,850
We need delivery systems. Now we need to
get to the moon. Now we need to, you know,

277
00:17:46,851 --> 00:17:49,720
like all of those things are real time.

278
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:54,090
It's a war, a war of dollars
in a wharf. Science. And um,

279
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,320
we got all those scientists.
Yeah. The Russians didn't, well,

280
00:17:58,321 --> 00:18:01,950
they got some sound. Not very
many. Operation paperclip was what,

281
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:05,250
what brought over the Wernher von Braun,
who was,

282
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,900
when you talk to Jews that were in Berlin
during the time that Wernher von Braun

283
00:18:09,901 --> 00:18:11,430
was running his rocket program there,

284
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:16,550
he would hang the five slowest Jews in
front of the rocket factory in Berlin.

285
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,050
Just to give everybody
motivation to work harder. Yeah.

286
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:24,480
It's the Simon Wiesenthal Center said
that if Wernher von Braun was alive today,

287
00:18:24,481 --> 00:18:28,260
they would prosecute him for crimes
against humanity. He was a Nazi,

288
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,770
straight up Nazi. And people, there's
apologists that say, no, no, no.

289
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:35,310
He was a scientist. He was forced into
doing that. Like, that's like, okay,

290
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:40,560
he's a Nazi. There's photographs of him
wearing Nazi garb hanging out with Nazis.

291
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:44,370
He, they, his rocket factory
killed Jews like this is,

292
00:18:44,371 --> 00:18:47,940
these are all undeniable facts and sent
the war ends and they're not Nazis.

293
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,210
Exactly how that works.
Exactly. But they were for,

294
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:54,020
they were forgiven because they came over
and contributed to our rocket program.

295
00:18:54,021 --> 00:18:56,490
I'm not that, I'm not that good of
a human. I don't have that in me.

296
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,720
I don't have that like, okay, it's like.
