1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
The way. It's not mark that joke
anymore. There's a good strong,

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,940
well that's the weird wings of a
butterfly that becomes a hurricane, right?

3
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:09,630
Like we need to go back in your life and
think about weird little lefts you took

4
00:00:09,631 --> 00:00:13,770
or rights you took when I have a bunch
of those. When I had three months ago,

5
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:18,660
I had a heart attack when I was on the
table because of the good doctor was just

6
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:23,340
like, uh, you, uh, you have, uh, a
hundred percent occlusion in your lad.

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,480
And I was like, I don't know what that
means. He says, your lad is, you're a,

8
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:30,930
is that main artery that goes across
the front of your heart? He's going, uh,

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,420
it's a hundred percent occlusion,
means a hundred percent blocked,

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,350
you've got cholesterol is blocked,
there's no way for blood to get through.

11
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:40,590
And that's what's creating your mass part
of tech. So he's like, we're going to,

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,470
we're going to take care of it right now.
He goes, but you're a comic Book Guy,

13
00:00:43,471 --> 00:00:45,900
right? I said, yeah. And
he goes, you'll like this,

14
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:49,740
that artery that's called the widow
maker. And I said, why? And he goes,

15
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:54,390
because 80% of cases of 100% occlusion,
the patient always dies.

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,420
He's gone, but you're going to be in the
20% because I'm really good at my job.

17
00:00:57,421 --> 00:00:59,120
And he fucking disappeared into my crotch,

18
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:03,300
one of my groin to my femoral artery and
fucking went up into my heart and put a

19
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:07,710
stent in that, in that lad. And
the moment he opened up, he goes,

20
00:01:07,711 --> 00:01:09,540
I'm gonna open it up now.
And he showed me what it was,

21
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:13,530
tiny little mesh wire thing. He goes, I'm
gonna open it. Boom. Suddenly it was like,

22
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,430
I,
cause that artery had been like a hose.

23
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,790
If you bend it and it's fucking full of
water and shit was pushing down in the

24
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:22,710
heart, which was in turn
pushing down on my lungs.

25
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:24,180
I had no idea it was
having a heart attack.

26
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:26,730
I just thought like I couldn't catch
my breath. I thought it was too hot.

27
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,060
It was in between shows in between
two gigs. That was the filming.

28
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,700
We shot them both while we
were going to shoot them both.

29
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:35,400
We only shot the one because I had the
heart attack and we didn't do the second

30
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:36,750
one, but it was for, uh,

31
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,200
for the folks at comedy dynamics
and it became a showtime special.

32
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,420
So we were shooting two shows that night.

33
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:44,940
It was meant to be like an
hour and an hour. But you know,

34
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:47,070
once you get up there I feel like
I'm fucking rolling. I'm rolling.

35
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:50,340
So I did two hours and after
the first show they were like,

36
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:51,630
we don't even need to do the second show.

37
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,580
We can cut an that we're only
cutting an hour out of it.

38
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:55,020
So you gave us plenty and stuff.
I said,

39
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:57,780
I got two different hours so
I want to do the second show.

40
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,640
And plus everyone was there.
They were lined up.

41
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,920
And so I took a big swig of
fucking milk cows, dairy drinker,

42
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:08,430
heavy dairy drinker.
In those days I've since become Vegan ice,

43
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:12,510
be happy now I'm fucking Vegan.
But uh, I took a big swig of milk,

44
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,750
then I went to the green room and I
chitchatted real quick with Jordan,

45
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:19,980
who runs our company as Jason's
wife, chase muses, wife. And, uh,

46
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:23,620
Emily was there, she does my hair
and makeup, so we're Chitchat.

47
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,800
And then I was like, man, I
feel fucking weird. I feel sick.

48
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:27,600
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
Can you guys get Outta here?

49
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:31,020
Cause when I get sick I just want to go
off like an animal and fucking die alone.

50
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,810
Like I don't want to be ministered to.
I'm like fuck off and shit.

51
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,790
So they were like, yeah, totally.

52
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,850
And I laid down on the floor
and I felt like nauseous,

53
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,100
nauseated and I never feel sick like
that and wound up throwing up some bile,

54
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,990
nothing chunky but just like
fluid. And so I was like, well,

55
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,490
and maybe I'll feel better now.

56
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:50,160
Stood up and I looked in the
mirror and I was just swamped man.

57
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:54,540
Like now as a heavy dude, you sweat when
he fucking breathe. But this was like,

58
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,600
I'd look like I'd just come out of
the pool and I felt really cold.

59
00:02:57,601 --> 00:03:01,840
I couldn't get warm and ship. Emily popped
her head and she's like, are you okay?

60
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,110
I was like, no man. Can you turn on like
a hairdryer and just like draw me off.

61
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:06,430
I feel fucking freezing cold.

62
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,250
And she touched the back of my neck
while she's driving me. She's like,

63
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:12,460
you never feel like this. This is scary.
You should do something. I said, yeah.

64
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:16,270
I said I would still want to
do that second show as like
someone to find a couch,

65
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:19,000
just find a cash for me to lay down.
If I get like a half hour nap,

66
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,590
I'm sure I'll be fucking fine. And I
couldn't get comfortable on the couch,

67
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:24,341
couldn't sleep.

68
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:28,900
And that's when I started not being able
to catch my fucking breath. So you know,

69
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:31,300
I'm no doctor but like
fucking you think you know,

70
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:33,820
I know my body and I know what this is.

71
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:36,730
I smoked too much weed and I've got
too much mucus in my fucking chest.

72
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,860
That's all this is.
So I said,

73
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:43,210
I better sit up and put my arms up like
this because that will help me breathe.

74
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,190
And Jordan comes around the
corner eventually and she
sees me. She's like, oh,

75
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:51,160
you're right. And I was like, you know,
having a hard time catching my breath.

76
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:54,130
I could breathe. I just can't get all the
way to the top and stuff of the breath.

77
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:57,780
Can't take a full fucking
breath. I was like, ah, maybe I,

78
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,890
maybe we shouldn't do that second
show after all. And she goes,

79
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,290
we already canceled it.
And I was like,

80
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,960
why the fuck did you cancel the
second show? And she was like,

81
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:08,560
cause I'd never seen you sick like this.
He's gone, you know this, this is weird.

82
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:10,570
Something's going on. I said,
yeah, maybe I should see a doctor.

83
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,800
And she goes to Sunday night, all doctors
are closed. So we called an ambulance.

84
00:04:13,801 --> 00:04:16,870
I was like, why the fuck did you call
an ambulance? Oh my God, this is don't,

85
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,700
this is embarrassing. She's
like, they're already here.

86
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,070
And six fireman came into the room,

87
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,620
big brawny fucking dude's
when he called paramedics,

88
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,830
fire department comes as well. So, uh,

89
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:29,740
they're looking at me cause I'm sitting
in the chair with my arms up and like

90
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:32,350
there were, some of them were young,
four of them are young. And I looked,

91
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:35,530
they looked at me like, why is silent
Bob celebrating a fucking touchdown?

92
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,550
You know, and she doesn't like all of a
sudden the medics came in and they, uh,

93
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,430
there was a guy and a girl and the
guy puts a cuff on me. He goes,

94
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:46,540
how you doing man? I said, good, I can't
really catch my breath. And, uh, he goes,

95
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:50,380
well, we're gonna look at you right now.
Put this Kufanya you ever had this done?

96
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:54,000
I said, Oh yeah, I know how to do
this. And then the girl had a, uh,

97
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,770
like look like a fishing tackle box.
I had a bunch of leads,

98
00:04:56,771 --> 00:04:59,950
wires coming out of it and shit,
she put that down as heart monitor thing,

99
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:02,950
you know, they get your fucking blood
pressure, all that shit on one arm.

100
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,950
Then the other thing they put on your
chest to monitor what's going on inside.

101
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,070
So she's like,
I got to put these wires on you as okay.

102
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:14,140
And I'm sitting in the chair and this
is 40 pounds ago and sitting is no good

103
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:17,110
angle for fucking fat guy to
begin with and shit like that.

104
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:22,111
So she just yanks my fucking hockey shirt
and the undershirt up and every tiddy

105
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:26,770
I have falls out of my fucking shirt in
front of these people and there's a room

106
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:30,040
full of people and I'm like, oh, lead
fucking shit. And I yanked my shit down.

107
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,900
She's like, what are you
doing? I was like, man,

108
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:35,830
that's my fucking best friend's wife over
there. She never seen my fucking tits.

109
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:37,580
My wife's never seen
much. It's like, I can't,

110
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,420
you don't Yank my shirt up like that. She
goes, Hey, get these wires on you. I said,

111
00:05:40,421 --> 00:05:44,230
well, oh the shirt are you reach up
under and put them on my chest. He goes,

112
00:05:44,231 --> 00:05:45,910
how am I supposed to seek?
And I was like,

113
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:49,120
do you just use my nipples as
guideposts? Like it was, you know,

114
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:54,040
I've spent all of my life trying to hide
my fucking fat and when your life is in

115
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:57,220
danger, I've never been in that situation.
But when your life is in danger,

116
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,310
nobody gives a fuck about your fucking
ego and shit. Like their vanity.

117
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,880
So they looked at their info and they
realize, I guess what was going on.

118
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:07,460
And they were like, we're going to take
you to the hospital just to be safe.

119
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:09,740
And I was like, don't do that.
That's fucking embarrassing and shit.

120
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,530
And they were like, Nah, we're
so close man. It'll be fun.

121
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:14,510
You ever been to the hospital?
I was like, no, not really.

122
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,570
Feel like it's all so fuck. It's fun.
He goes, you're gonna have a good time.

123
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,720
I was like, all right. And you know,
I'm a podcaster, so I'm like, look,

124
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:24,080
at the end of the day, no time is
wasted. Everything's a fucking story.

125
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:27,080
So if this turns into the opening five
minutes of Hollywood Babylon where I'm

126
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:27,590
like,

127
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,290
they took me to the hospital and it
turned out it was just too fucking high.

128
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,670
Like it's life's great when you're a
podcaster because there's no such thing as

129
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:38,630
fucking bad news anymore. Like it hit,
it can hit you on the level of like,

130
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,440
Oh shit, that's unfortunate.
But right away you repurpose
it into like, all right,

131
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:43,840
well I've got something to talk about.

132
00:06:43,841 --> 00:06:48,841
And this latest setback is just the
longest is just a momentary chapter in the

133
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:50,570
long story.
Or fucking tell him.

134
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:53,450
So I was happy to go to the
hospital and not because I was like,

135
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:56,770
I think I'm dying, but because
I was like, all right, fuck it.

136
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,180
I'll have a story to tell after
this next week. It'll be fun.

137
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,280
I got to the hospital like Dr Laden,
Jaime's the guys now, my cardiologist,

138
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,650
they pulled me into the er and
he's like, hi, how are you?

139
00:07:06,651 --> 00:07:09,110
I'm Doctor Leighton him and said, hey man,
how are you? He goes, well, what's wrong?

140
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:13,250
What's going on? And I said, I can't
catch my breath. Um, and he goes, well,

141
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:14,990
that's because you're having
a massive heart attack.

142
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,230
And it was the first time anyone
had said anything like that.

143
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,660
How did he know for sure
if that's what he does?

144
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,920
I think what he knew for sure was when
they put the leads on me and the blood

145
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:27,740
pressure,
they looked at each other at one point,

146
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,700
but I assumed like in like numbers
that'll show up to indicate that something

147
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:35,030
just happened and they made this wonderful
call. I've got to find these kids,

148
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:36,490
give him a hug one day.
Ah,

149
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,260
on the call sheet because we were
shooting that night on the call sheet.

150
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,730
It was a different hospital,

151
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:46,150
but they took me to Glendale Adventist
because they knew that I was in having a

152
00:07:47,271 --> 00:07:51,680
cardiac episode and that's shy
of one hospital in New York.

153
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,040
Glen Dale Adventist is one of the best
cardiology wings in the United States of

154
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,140
America. So I happen to be in the
right fucking place at the right time.

155
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:04,310
We were supposed to shoot my
comedy special at the Ryman
Auditorium in Nashville.

156
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:09,290
Um, it wound up being shot instead at
the Alex in, in Glendale and stuff.

157
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,460
And if I hadn't been doing the show there,
who fucking knows man,

158
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:17,750
I'm gone to a hospital but I probably
might've fucking died cause homeboy told

159
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:21,320
me when he went up the heart when I was
in the operating room and he told me

160
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:25,700
like, they call that the widow
maker and shit, 80%, 80, 20.

161
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,970
I sat there going like, these are the
weirdest Todd's I've ever had in my life.

162
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:31,550
I figure like, look, you
leave the house, it's 50 50,

163
00:08:31,551 --> 00:08:33,160
you're going to fucking drop dead.
Right.

164
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,820
They get hit by a car
struck by lightening,

165
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:38,210
you can trip over fucking dog and then
the dog bites your juggler and you

166
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:41,450
fucking bleed out your look. But I
always loved dogs and you die ironically,

167
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,170
but uh, you know, just stringing
along. But the 80 20 men,

168
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:47,750
20% chance of life was fucked up,
fucked up thought.

169
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:49,910
First time I'd ever had
that kind of thought.

170
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:54,800
And in my head I had to cognitively
reframe it and go, you don't know,

171
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:58,170
you might've been close to death
so many fucking times in your life.

172
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,110
There might've been like a psycho behind
you with a fucking knife and then all

173
00:09:01,111 --> 00:09:03,810
of sudden you've got a cell phone call
and forgot about you or something like

174
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:07,800
that. So suddenly our repurposed it the
whole time I was laying on the table,

175
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:11,460
I'll get repurposing everything,
not repurpose and cognitively reframing.

176
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:14,790
I was sitting because I couldn't
like at one point they were like,

177
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:17,310
your wife's on the phone. Do you
want to say you want to talk to her?

178
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,950
After they told me that I was having a
heart attack and that they had to get up

179
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:21,000
and be fast and stuff.

180
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,320
So they're holding up a phone and I see
it and as the first time a crystallized

181
00:09:25,321 --> 00:09:30,230
where I was like, oh, these, these people
think I'm going to die. Like I didn't.

182
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,760
I was in no pain whatsoever.
I couldn't catch my breath.

183
00:09:32,761 --> 00:09:36,090
They kept asking me like zero to 10.
How do you feel? What's your pain level?

184
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,190
I was like, negative three. They'll
look, you're doing this wrong.

185
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,270
I didn't feel pain. It wasn't like, yeah,

186
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,780
I grew up in the 70s
watching Sanford and son.

187
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:44,190
So my idea of a heart attack is loose,

188
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,480
but that's big and shit felt none of
the symptoms, no numbness in the arm,

189
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:53,100
anything like that. I was sweating a,
I threw up bile, a little bit of bile.

190
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:57,720
Um, I was cold and, and
what was the last one?

191
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,050
It was just fucking shit. You would
never associate with a heart attack.

192
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,720
And like you would associate it with like,
oh, I just, I feel under the weather.

193
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,050
But apparently these are symptoms
of heart attacks as well.

194
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,410
I like to share it because some
cats never heard that before.

195
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,930
And I've seen a lot of people on
social media since we were like,

196
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,310
you saved my life.
Here's why.

197
00:10:14,311 --> 00:10:16,410
Because I talked about the
fucking symptoms and shit.

198
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:20,280
So while I'm laying there and they go up,
you're growing,

199
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,010
they go up your femoral artery
to your heart and stuff.

200
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,950
He went up and he saw that
it was all blocked. He,

201
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:27,930
I said later on I was just like,
fuck man.

202
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:30,030
Like I'd like dropped 80
pounds three years ago.

203
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:33,930
I've been like walking up a hill mile
and a half every day and stuff. He goes,

204
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:34,071
yeah,

205
00:10:34,071 --> 00:10:38,400
but the kind of blockage you had you go
to that didn't start fucking recently.

206
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:42,510
He's gone. That started in childhood and
I was like, man, fucking hostess Twinkies.

207
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:44,640
And then I remembered we had
no money so I was like, man,

208
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:47,640
fucking little Debbie Swiss delights
and shit. That's how it happened.

209
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:49,380
It started with a little Debbie cakes.

210
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:51,720
I'm with you cause I was raised
Dunham and shit. But you know,

211
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:54,840
we were trained to like Twinkies more
because they had a commercial little,

212
00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:56,460
Debbie would never
bother with a commercial.

213
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,130
They didn't have a commercial
did day. No, you can't. Well,

214
00:10:59,131 --> 00:11:00,960
the leaders later they did,
but when we were kids,

215
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:04,050
they didn't because how can you have
a commercial and sell your product,

216
00:11:04,051 --> 00:11:06,480
but they're only 9 cents a bottle?
Easter cake.

217
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,230
It's like a better experience because
they had more of those trans fats that

218
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,840
have trans fats back then. I think
so. And then they could call and fats.
