1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,470
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,950
Here's the problem with stopping hate
speech is like who's to decide because

3
00:00:07,951 --> 00:00:10,820
they're pushing the boundary. Would
hate speech so far in that, right?

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,610
Like if you call a trans woman,
a man that's hate speech like that,

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,620
there's,

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,470
it's Kinda what did, that's
just an accident. Yeah,

7
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:22,140
it's still accidental hate
speech. Why? That's crazy.

8
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:23,970
Because we live in a new world now.
See,

9
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:28,080
I can't accept that you don't go online
and now if you do it out of malice,

10
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:32,760
like if you're, if someone's like, Hey,
I'm Margaret, and the guy goes, no, no,

11
00:00:32,761 --> 00:00:34,970
I'm not going to call you that good there,

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,810
then that's them being proactively
prejudice. Right? I'm being a dick.

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,673
They're being an asshole.

14
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,810
But some people are of the
opinion that this is all nonsense.

15
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,720
But if it's an unknown, but I'm not
sure I'm not taking, taking their point.

16
00:00:46,721 --> 00:00:49,270
But I do want to play devil's advocate
because I've had conversations with

17
00:00:49,271 --> 00:00:52,960
people who are pretty intelligent people
than to say, this is all nonsense.

18
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,390
And then this trans stuff,
and this is,

19
00:00:55,391 --> 00:00:57,940
this is a trendy thing that
people were really getting into.

20
00:00:57,941 --> 00:00:59,840
In summary Bore really distorted.

21
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,730
Like their perceptions of reality is
really distorted and they're being talked

22
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:05,860
into this because it's a thing
that a lot of people are doing it.

23
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,740
And so they're getting, and
um, I hear that and I go, wow,

24
00:01:08,741 --> 00:01:13,090
I don't know if I believe that people
are willing to transition to another sex

25
00:01:13,091 --> 00:01:16,810
because they're confused. That's
a big leap. It's a giant ass leap.

26
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,280
But here's the other leap.

27
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:23,200
The leap is you telling someone
whether or not they feel a certain way.

28
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,320
And then the other leap, here's the
other leap. What do you give a fuck

29
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,150
if Bruce Jenner wants to become
Caitlyn Jenner? Okay, I'll call

30
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,070
or Katelyn to, I don't care. But if she
thinks I'm gonna stop making fun of her,

31
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:35,590
she's out of her fucking okay. That's
what it, but that's what I mean.

32
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:37,000
So you should be allowed to just,

33
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:41,110
you should be allowed to mock at a freedom
that you would anyway, every six foot,

34
00:01:41,111 --> 00:01:46,000
three person would size 14 high heels
gets mocked, just listen around the clock.

35
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,290
It, anybody would get made fun of for
any of that in any other way. Yes.

36
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,070
If you used to be a girl or you used
to be a dude and now you're a girl,

37
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,480
someone's gonna make fun of you.

38
00:01:55,481 --> 00:01:58,000
And that's just the price
you pay for being a person.

39
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,860
But people make fun of everyone for
everything. Everything. You have red hair,

40
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,860
right? Is My whole life,
your whole life. But what?

41
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,700
I can't start a group against it being
like people trying enough of this enough.

42
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,020
No, just it is what it is.
Everyone has these slots. The
kick of Ginger Ginger Day.

43
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,020
That wasn't cool. No, but no, but
you know what's so funny about that?

44
00:02:14,021 --> 00:02:15,130
Those guys were so subversive.

45
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,660
What they're doing is showing how quickly
people jump onto things and go, yeah,

46
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:22,390
fuck them. It's true. Come
on. So they're so smart.

47
00:02:22,391 --> 00:02:25,630
I love that episode because it
was like that could be a real,

48
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,150
and that's how dumb people are.
People in the real world have told me,

49
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,850
been like through it. I wonder where
we kick of Ginger Day is they buy.

50
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,540
That's real to them. But that's,
that's by the way I played,

51
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,060
I played golf with a buddy
at the country club that, uh,

52
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:42,130
Caitlyn Jenner belongs to.
My first question does,

53
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,200
does she hit from the women's season,
the men's tees? And the guy with me goes,

54
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,540
she hits from the women's taste. I'm
like, Bull Shit. See, that's bullshit.

55
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,230
Is it bullshit dude? Because you, you,
you're a fucking Olympian. You, you were,

56
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,460
you still at the difference between the
men's tees? I mean, like distance 30,

57
00:02:57,461 --> 00:03:02,410
40 yards. Yeah. Ah, yeah.
That's like doing those pushups
on your knees. Bullshit.

58
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,580
Yeah. Good on your toes, but oh, but wait
a minute. He used it. Uh, she, she had,

59
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,780
she has man structured muscle and
didn't go away. That's all gone.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,880
No muscle. There's no muscle. While she's
still pretty fucking jet. Not Really,

61
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:19,600
man. No, I'm going to be honest, I
don't think she works out at all.

62
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,200
And she's old already.
So it's not like your body has,

63
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,920
I still say you go back to the most taste,
but she still has a Dick, right? Nope.

64
00:03:26,921 --> 00:03:30,670
She had the operation. Cut it off.
It's hollow. Is it gone? Yes. No. Okay.

65
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:34,780
Now you get women's tees it up.
Dick was there. You gotta go.

66
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,190
You gotta go back to the black.
Yeah.

67
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:39,540
This is a lot of fence riders out there
in the Trans World. You got to pick it.

68
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,460
You got to pick dude. You gotta come, you
gotta come or go. That's another thing.

69
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:44,590
They're saying this,
and this I don't agree with this,

70
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:49,090
is they're saying that if you are a
person who is male and likes women,

71
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,210
if you are unwilling
to date a trans woman,

72
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,870
it's because you are a transphobic bigot,

73
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,920
including if that trans woman
still has a penis. That is,

74
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,540
that's of no regard. You know what
the, you know, the funny thing of the,

75
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,580
of all this is I'm so happy to just
be a CIS gender men, like a fucking,

76
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,880
I'm so happy to not have to worry about
it. I don't have to worry about it.

77
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,070
No one's gonna call me a bigot for not
liking a subsect of a kind of a thing

78
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:18,370
that I like. I just like a
wall. I like women. That's
all I know. I like, that's it.

79
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:21,590
I'm fine now. They'll come around
to you soon. Take [inaudible].

80
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,390
They got Bruno Mars.
He didn't see it coming home on that.

81
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,150
What did they say after?
Brutal. I'm writing black
culture. Cultural appropriation.

82
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,160
You see how many people came to his rescue
though? A bunch of people were like,

83
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:33,350
that's bullshit. He's a musician.
He cores. What has he done?

84
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,720
Was He appropriating black culture?
Zinging awesome. Made good music. Yeah,

85
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,300
that's all he did.
That billionaire songs,

86
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,610
a wonderful song and he made some
fucking great songs. Great artists.

87
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,910
It's bullshit to think that people now
can stab at anything that you're like,

88
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,210
now you're just trying to cause a stir.
They try it.

89
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,900
They take swings at sometimes don't work.

90
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:52,830
Like remember they were trying to block
Bossy, stop saying yeah, that's right.

91
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:57,360
Yeah, but like fuck off. Like
okay. Can just put it out.

92
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,970
I just want to put it out there and try
to put it out. It just giving it a shot.

93
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,120
Yeah. Bruno Mars, they shut this down
so fast and he didn't say anything back.

94
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,610
Good for him. That's my favorite
shit. Yeah. It's Kinda like,

95
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,250
you know how like Samsung and
all these other phone companies,

96
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,060
they make ads about I iPhones, you
know, other, all their ads are based on,

97
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:16,630
fuck I phones and apple never
makes a response. Of course,

98
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,670
that's the coolest movies
to be like, whatever, man.

99
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:28,680
Okay.
