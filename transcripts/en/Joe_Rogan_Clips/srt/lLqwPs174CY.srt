1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,340
But you don't ever work out boxing wise
anymore. Yeah, but do you don't hit it.

2
00:00:05,341 --> 00:00:06,130
Hit a bag.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:11,130
My son's 15 and I know he wants to
buck so anytime we get a chance,

4
00:00:11,621 --> 00:00:13,120
you know I'm always training him.

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,410
How big is he now? Six feet.
Jesus has told them the news.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,460
Tyson's son, Tyson son
is 16 oh Miguel. Yeah.

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,510
Tyson son was saying that he wants
a box to Tyson's. Like listen, no,

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,670
Miguel was not built like that. But
he's also saying, listen you, you,

9
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,330
you grew up soft and you
know he's saying like,

10
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:35,070
you don't want to meet someone like
me. You know like the way he was. Yeah,

11
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,460
I know Mike. I know you want
to meet some animal like me.

12
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,050
You know like when he was fighting like
he like he thinks of what he would've

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,610
done to his own son's like,
oh don't do that.

14
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,700
Like he was talking about it on the
podcast and his son Miguel's Oh really

15
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:52,320
talented kid. Like musician wise can play
like seven different instruments. Wow.

16
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,000
Spanish. Wow. The kid's really,
and he's a really smart, nice kid.

17
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,270
Well, Tyson is a smart guy. He's not
like he, I think people mistake tied.

18
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:05,730
Some are big a dummy. He's very,
very intelligent. Well read.

19
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,110
Boxing is in at least some levels of very,

20
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,400
very intellectual pursuit.
There's,

21
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,750
you have to have a strong mind to
be able to dodge those punches,

22
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:18,120
get in and get yours in that you have to,

23
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,630
you have to be able to sort out that
problem is a problem in front of you.

24
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,710
The problem is another man who was the
same way as you, the same size as you.

25
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:28,620
He's got gloves on just like you do and
he's trying to do what you're trying to

26
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,910
do to him. And you have to do
that within seconds. Boom. Yeah.

27
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,220
Punches thrown at you. What do you
do? What's, what's the rebuttal? Yeah.

28
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:36,031
People don't understand.

29
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:39,900
They think just because someone doesn't
have the best vocabulary or because they

30
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:40,441
don't have a,

31
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:45,300
a comprehensive education that they're
not intelligent and that's a big mistake.

32
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,040
No, twice Tyson's intelligence. Uh,

33
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,460
I remember going to the
Catskills when I was, uh,

34
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,250
I won the world junior championships
in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.

35
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,960
And I remember the American
team was saying, oh, well
you never fought the best.

36
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,370
I'm like, I didn't fight
the best. I thought American
sent them best team. Yeah.

37
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:05,240
But one guy,

38
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,540
he doesn't like taking plans and this
manager don't like taking plans either.

39
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,860
So I'm like, who's that? And they told
me it was Mike Tyson custom model.

40
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,030
So me and my trainer,

41
00:02:14,031 --> 00:02:18,950
we left Canada and we drove all the
way up there and while we were up there

42
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,530
raise the Roderick was up
there and they said, oh,

43
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,940
raising really came to inspire with
us. So okay, I'll start with the,

44
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:30,410
I'm here for four days.
So first time Tyson actually met me,

45
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,340
you know, he was Nice Guy, really
nice guy, took me in his room,

46
00:02:34,341 --> 00:02:38,420
showed me some old flicks that I've never
seen before of old time fighters would

47
00:02:38,421 --> 00:02:43,220
tell me about each fighter, like he
studied them. And then, um, you know,

48
00:02:43,221 --> 00:02:47,660
this is where he got his old star is
his style of fighting from. And uh,

49
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,440
first day in the first day in the gym
bell when he came across and he was trying

50
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:55,760
to kill me.
Like,

51
00:02:55,761 --> 00:02:59,120
you know I did my Muhammad Ali thing
obviously stayed away from his power,

52
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,490
but the first day was really hectic and
then the second day was a little hectic

53
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:05,080
and it got better as it went along.

54
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:10,270
And the last day is I got actually the
better of him the last day and I remember

55
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:14,770
custom models saying, Mike, you're going
to meet him some day. Don't you do that?

56
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:19,270
And not always echoed in my
mind that will we ever fight?

57
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:22,180
Will we have a fight? Cause cause the
model said that we're going to fight.

58
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,410
Why did it happen? And there's
footage of it. Yeah. Wow.

59
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,850
Lennox has the footage of it.
Footage of the training centers.

60
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,190
Barring how old was Tyson at
the time? Tyson was like, uh,

61
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,200
he was about 52. No, no. How old
was he at the time? Oh, at the time.

62
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,590
15. Um, he was, he was younger
than me. I was on Sunday.

63
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,740
He's about 17. Wow. I was
18. He was younger than that.

64
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:48,963
There must've been

65
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,640
fours before the, uh, empire state
games and everything. Can you,

66
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,280
would you want up there before you went
to the 84 Olympics? Yeah. Yeah. Well,

67
00:03:56,281 --> 00:03:58,520
it must have been crazy though,
knowing that, you know, you,

68
00:03:58,521 --> 00:04:03,240
you guys were going to be a part of boxing
history and knowing that all the way

69
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:07,560
back then and being a teenager and
standing in front and here in custom model

70
00:04:07,561 --> 00:04:08,430
scream that out.

71
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,060
That must have been intense.

72
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,890
It was intense because custom
motto wasn't that loud when he was,

73
00:04:15,891 --> 00:04:19,610
when they, all of a sudden he became
loud. It was like everybody listened,

74
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,980
you know, and then, you know,

75
00:04:21,981 --> 00:04:24,260
there's certain ways that you would
get across to people and some,

76
00:04:24,261 --> 00:04:25,970
some people take you
have to shout at them.

77
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,280
Did you ever wish that you
fought him in his prime? Um,

78
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:33,530
in essence I did fight him in his
prime and you know, when you say prime,

79
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,160
I was in my prime too. You know, you will

80
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,330
fleeing your prime. You were, you were,

81
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:43,160
but I feel like his enthusiasm
had waned before then. You know,

82
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,040
um, I, you know, this is my perception,

83
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:51,270
how I look at that whole thing is
Mike Tyson was an early bloomer.

84
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,100
I was a late bloomer. So, you know,
when, when both of us meet, you know,

85
00:04:56,101 --> 00:04:59,910
there's never a perfect time. Perfect
time for us is when we meet in the middle.

86
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,080
Right, right, right. And, you know,

87
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,900
right. And if he won, maybe people would
look at it differently. Right. This,

88
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,720
because you beat him and beat him so
soundly that people look at it like maybe

89
00:05:08,721 --> 00:05:10,400
his, his time had already been gone. Yeah.

90
00:05:10,401 --> 00:05:14,420
Lenox turned pro after Mike
had already had a defeat. Wow.

91
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:18,860
No claims turn pro and 89. Wow.
I never even thought of that.

92
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,210
And Mike lost in January.
Right?

93
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,670
Yeah. This is us open up. Look at

94
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:28,410
you. Look at Kevin Rooney.
Wow. That is crazy, man. God,

95
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,660
that's crazy built back then too.
We had a big neck. Yeah. He, well,

96
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:37,050
he was always doing those neck bridges.
He, but he also just had freak genetics.

97
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,000
I mean, just phenomenal genetic
specimen, you know. Uh, I had um, uh,

98
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:45,660
Teddy Atlas in here and Teddy House used
to take Mike to the smokers when he was

99
00:05:45,661 --> 00:05:48,150
13.
And Teddy was joking around about it,

100
00:05:48,151 --> 00:05:50,250
said everybody always lied
about how old people were.

101
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,920
They would tell you the kid was 16,
when really it was 20.

102
00:05:52,921 --> 00:05:56,760
They always did that and he said, uh, he
goes, uh, so, uh, how old is this kid?

103
00:05:56,761 --> 00:05:59,570
He was 13. He goes, what does he
weigh? He goes, 190 pounds. It's like,

104
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:03,710
what the fuck teddy, come on. He's
like, I'm telling Ya, he's sick.

105
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,060
He's fucking 13. What do you want? So,

106
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,880
you know, nobody would believe it
because he was such a specimen.

107
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,210
I watched that one.
Teddy was great man.

108
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,200
Do you think he should
have stayed with teddy?

109
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:20,540
Should have stayed with Kevin and
Teddy? Well he definitely, you know,

110
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,990
he was so wild. Like how, how could
you tell him what to do back then?

111
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,770
That was part of the problem. I mean,
he was never, no one ever prepared him.

112
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:30,800
And this is one of the things that we
discussed on the podcast was that he was a

113
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:33,680
12 year old, 13 year old boy
and he was getting hypnotized.

114
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,280
He had came from a terrible
background. It was, there was no love,

115
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,270
he was abandoned and all of a sudden
he's getting love and attention for

116
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:44,420
something. And this one thing
was this man who was telling him,

117
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:47,510
you're going to be a great fight or
you're going to be a world champion.

118
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,560
And he would hypnotize me saying,
you don't exist. The task exists.

119
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,530
You know you're going to work
the body and destroy this man.

120
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:58,040
And he would tell he would
put these thoughts in his
head and Mike couldn't wait

121
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:01,070
to just get out there and fuck people up.
Cause that's where he got the love.

122
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,500
That's where he got the attention from.
But he never turned,

123
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,960
never told them how to shut it off.
He never,

124
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,780
I mean he didn't have time to
work with him cause he was,

125
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,430
he was on his way out and he
was dying when he met Mike.

126
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,840
And so he only taught them how to destroy.
He never taught them how to cope.

127
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,440
He never taught them how to understand
that there's going to be a lot of shit

128
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:21,200
coming your way and you've got to know
what that is and don't get caught up in

129
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:24,930
that hype train. Don't just don't get
wrapped up in Hollywood. And you know,

130
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,660
he wound up marrying robbin
Gibbons and you know, all,

131
00:07:27,661 --> 00:07:30,470
I don't think cus foresaw
all that other bullshit. No.

132
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,220
How could he of course was around
Mike would be totally different.

133
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:37,610
He would have been a different man if
costs lasted another 15 years given if

134
00:07:37,611 --> 00:07:40,370
Jimmy Jacobs had lasted another
five years, maybe. Yeah,

135
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:41,510
maybe it would have helped.

136
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:44,180
But I mean it's like once
you're once removed from cus,

137
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,330
it's like Kevin Rooney was
once removed from costs. Right.

138
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,260
And then Teddy Atlas was way more of
a hard liner. You know, Teddy Atlas,

139
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:53,240
you couldn't put any bullshit with,
you know,

140
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:55,280
and like those other guys who
just got to go, ah, you know,

141
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,650
when he got to Aaron's snowball
and all those guys was with them,

142
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,550
bums reaching Ghia Ketty they
just didn't, they, they didn't.

143
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,850
They could have never brought
Mike to the dance. Right.

144
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,370
They got there when he was already at
the dance and they just trying to like

145
00:08:07,371 --> 00:08:09,920
maintain things and he's
not listening to anybody.

146
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,580
They also weren't boxing people
as far as I was concerned

147
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:18,800
when he was up with costs use.
It was in a good situation.

148
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,040
You know, there was a lady in
the house cooking meals. Uh,

149
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,850
they had custody of being a father figure,
talk to him every day.

150
00:08:25,851 --> 00:08:29,010
And that's what young kids
need. They need that, you know,

151
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,650
to be spoken with by older
people. Yeah. And you know,

152
00:08:33,651 --> 00:08:36,860
a lot of young people nowadays are
not even respecting the older people,

153
00:08:36,861 --> 00:08:40,060
but they can get in a lot of information
from an older person. You know,

154
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,350
how do you deal with this
situation? Well, you know,

155
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,200
you hear it from an older person that
kind of makes your mind thinking, said,

156
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:47,030
you know, you're right. It works for them.

157
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:50,420
So anytime I get a chance to
talk to kids about, you know,

158
00:08:50,421 --> 00:08:53,360
their life and where they're going
or it's take that opportunity.
