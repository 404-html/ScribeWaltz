1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,960
Now, I, I'm not familiar with ultra
footwear, but what I wanted to ask you is,

2
00:00:03,961 --> 00:00:08,961
does anybody wear like minimalist
shoes and run these ultra marathons?

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,370
Yeah, yeah. There was, uh,
there was actually a Gal,
I cannot remember her name,

4
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:18,780
this is a couple of years ago who ran
ultra is in um, those Vibram FiveFingers.

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:24,030
Really? Yeah, yeah. In a trail
stuff too. So, um, you know,
it must have been a beast.

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was hard to run just
a couple of miles and it's, you know,

7
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:33,480
it's interesting because so ultra footwear
made the shoe this last year called

8
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:36,690
uh, the, the vanish and it's
essentially a minimalist shoe.

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,190
I'm just like a little bit of fabric on
the top, super, super hard flat base.

10
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:44,370
And that's kind of what I like
when I'm on a road or a track. Um,

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,510
so I was wearing that,
the vanish vanish. Yeah.

12
00:00:46,511 --> 00:00:50,700
Pull that up and see what that looks
like. And it's a, so I went to this, this,

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,630
this ultra race and I wore those thinking
I'm going to have the lightest shoe

14
00:00:54,631 --> 00:00:57,480
out of anyone here. Three guys show
up running completely barefoot.

15
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,640
Why they ran an ultra marathons barefoot?
Yeah, he had to. That's another level.

16
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,490
There was one,
there was one guy who is Christ,

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,420
he's like a to 22 or 23
marathoner and he's barefoot.

18
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,740
And he said that he runs a marathon bear,
so he doesn't do the marathon barefoot.

19
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,550
He actually said that, uh, the,

20
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,910
that's a little bit of padding
in that it looks like we're less,

21
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,560
there's a lip on the outside.

22
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,960
Is that the vanish or is
that the s is that it says
vantage guy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

23
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,400
So I mean there's, there's a
little bit, there's like a,

24
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,610
there's like a carbon fiber plate and you
see where that little cut is in there.

25
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,130
There's like a carbon fiber plate in
there that makes it a little more firm.

26
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,600
So when I'm looking for in a shoe and
I'm looking for kind of like that natural

27
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:41,010
feel is something that's got a affirm
its soul or affirm durometer because like

28
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,420
I don't want to squish down into the
shoe. I want pop right off the ground. Um,

29
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,150
and I think like, really
like that is just, I mean,

30
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:51,920
you've probably experienced this with
the, with the vibrams where like, um,

31
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,160
if you spend the time, your foot feet
gets stronger and stronger and stronger,

32
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,650
and it's only a matter of
time before they get strong.

33
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:01,300
If you've got to keep kind of working
at it, just like, you know, uh,

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,990
a weight lifter, you know, when
they start out weightlifting,

35
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,160
they're nowhere near where they are
10 years later. Um, so like for me,

36
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,230
back in 2012,
I think I kind of like,

37
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:15,570
you know, I read born to run and
if you've heard of the book, yeah,

38
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:18,450
I've heard it's amazing. Yeah. You
know, I, I, I read that and I was like,

39
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:22,490
this is intriguing, you know, and it made
a lot of sense too. It's like, you know,

40
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,350
if we were meant to have
a wedge on our heel,

41
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,150
like we would have had a wedge
on her heel. Yeah, no, that's,

42
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,680
that's a ridiculous thing
that Nike came up with.

43
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:35,200
And it's really unfortunate that so many
people have adopted that and they've

44
00:02:35,201 --> 00:02:37,440
run, he'll first like that. Yeah. Well in,

45
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:42,441
in the problem I think too is that like
the shoe is essentially a cast for your

46
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,700
foot.
Even even that vanish that I had up there,

47
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:47,430
that's a little cast compared to
what you're normally going to see.

48
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:48,420
But it's still a cast.

49
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:53,130
That's why I liked those five fingers
cause there's nothing, this is a very,

50
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:57,480
very flexible rubber rubber underneath
and it's a glove for your, for your feet.

51
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,620
Yeah. Yeah. And you know,

52
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:02,680
people just know that I think that you
can really work those foot muscles to a

53
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:05,960
point where you can exhaust them
the way you would in a shoe. Um,

54
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,070
it just takes a lot of time cause like
if I broke my arm and put a cast on it

55
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,910
and then like six,
eight weeks later got the cast taken off,

56
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:15,340
I went back in the weight
room and did a normal routine,

57
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,440
I would be wrecked the next day.

58
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,410
So when you take your foot
out of that shoe cast,

59
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:24,010
you have it in or take it out of the
position it's gotten used to and put it in

60
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:24,844
a different position.

61
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,570
It's like taking a cast off and trying
to do that full mode of mode of a

62
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:33,370
training or motion. So like, you know, I,
when I first kind of got an ultra running,

63
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:36,790
I, I, I worked my way
down to a minimal issue.

64
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,450
I spent probably six months before I was
running exclusively and something that

65
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:44,980
was um, really minimalist.
And when I say minimalist,

66
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:49,210
I mean zero drop and no cushion
or little to no cushion.

67
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,320
Cause I think some people
confuse that too. Like that the,

68
00:03:52,321 --> 00:03:53,850
the shoe you saw up
there cause she was like,

69
00:03:53,851 --> 00:03:55,240
oh it looks like it's got a
little bit of padding there.

70
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,840
So that's like zero drop with cushioning
or that she really doesn't have a lot

71
00:03:58,841 --> 00:04:02,380
of cushioning. But um, there are
shoes that ultra makes a does.

72
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,470
And what that does is it takes you
from like the way I describe is this is

73
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:09,010
someone in like a, um, someone
in a traditional running shoe,

74
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,090
real built up cushion. A lot of support
is on one in a spectrum, barefoot runner.

75
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:15,850
Like those dudes that I
ran into at the track. Um,

76
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,620
they're on the other end of the spectrum.

77
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:21,540
There's all the steps in
between to get to that. So like,

78
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,970
can't believe people run ultras
barefoot. Yeah. It's crazy.

79
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:26,880
I don't think there's too many
periods and fucking Saturday,

80
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,870
look at this dude barefoot. Ted. Ted. Ted.

81
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,030
The Sandal.
Yeah.

82
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,810
Sandal. Yeah. Hmm. Well that,

83
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,910
it wasn't that in the born to one that
these guys had made sandals out of tires.

84
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,690
Yeah. Yeah. I've been using
something called a pull up,

85
00:04:44,691 --> 00:04:48,180
this Vivo Vivo Barefoot.
I've been using these. Um,

86
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,250
what I like about these is that I
don't have to look where I step.

87
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,240
There's no cushioning at all.
The trail one, the, I'd use
that one on the far left,

88
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,680
the far left. Yeah. That one.
Um, there's no cushion to it,

89
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:05,630
but it's got some tread and the bottom
is hard enough so that I could run on

90
00:05:05,631 --> 00:05:08,210
hard rocks and then I
don't think about it.

91
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:12,320
It's hard to tell in that image
how little there is underneath it.

92
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,600
But there's a,

93
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,950
there's nothing going on in terms of
like there's no squished to it at all to

94
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,620
just some good size knobs.
So you have uh, some good,

95
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,400
some good tread, you know,
so you can, you know,

96
00:05:25,401 --> 00:05:30,400
you can get good traction and dirt and
mud and stuff like that that they weighed

97
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,230
nothing that's global,
that thing up to your foot.

98
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,870
Muscles are flexing every which way.
They were cool.

99
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,870
I made a big difference with me man.

100
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,800
But honestly the five fingers
are probably the best for that.

101
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,250
They just don't have as much traction
and I have to look where I'm stepping,

102
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,970
you know, like I have to be
careful like sharp rocks and stuff.

103
00:05:49,971 --> 00:05:51,680
I have to look down.
Don't step on that one of the guy.

104
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:56,270
I don't like looking run just
in with those. I can just
run, just flow through it.

105
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,620
Yeah, you can get a faster pace with
those. Yeah. And that's, that's,

106
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,390
that's where I kind of draw the line
too is like when I'm on the roads and on

107
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:05,330
the track, I don't mind having
that like no cushion type of thing.

108
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,610
But then when I go on like
the trails and Phoenix,

109
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:12,110
it's very rocky and hard and then I'll
use like a shoe called the king empty.

110
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,730
That's Kinda like the
one that you had there.

111
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:16,160
It's a little less nimble I would
say. Then that one, but it's got that,

112
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,030
that like really aggressive lug.
It's got the foot shape, toe box,

113
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:22,010
so I don't feel like my feet
are getting pinch together.

114
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,880
What do you think barefoot Ted
does on the trails? I was trails.

115
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,390
I think he probably wears those
sandals probably, right? Yeah.

116
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,260
Just something where it's got to
something that keeps him from getting cut,

117
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,810
but there are guys who just
do that barefoot to fuck.
I think they're very few,

118
00:06:38,811 --> 00:06:42,770
but it's, it's, it's doable. If you
ever see that show dual survivor,

119
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,250
it's one of those wacky survivor shows.
I don't know if I've seen that one.

120
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,830
This one guy,
I think his name's Corey,

121
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,150
who has the most disgusting fee I've
ever seen in my life almost as discussing

122
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:56,970
is that one guy was cutting the the
bottom of feet off and feeding it to dog.

123
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:01,160
The knife videos. Awful. To Watch, but a,

124
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:04,760
this guy walks barefoot
everywhere and his ideas like,

125
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:07,850
do you got to toughen your feet up? Cause
you might not have shoes. You know, they,

126
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,130
they get real crazy with
this whole survival is thing.

127
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,120
So this guy is basically has,
I'm not joking,

128
00:07:14,121 --> 00:07:18,500
like a good solid half inch of
callous under his entire foot.

129
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:22,040
It's amazing what the human body will
do when you put it in a position to need

130
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,140
to. Yeah. And when it has to adapt,

131
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,680
I mean it's one of the reasons why I'm
fascinated by guys like you these ultra

132
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:31,880
runners is because for the average person,
that's an impossible feat.

133
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:34,010
But you've built, there's
that guy's foot, look at that.

134
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,840
What ends up fuck it looks like elephant
skin. Yeah. It's fucking gnarly. Um,

135
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,240
but dick guys,

136
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:45,980
like you have adapted your body
to this position where, you know,

137
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:49,760
you can do that and it's just a matter
of putting in the training runs and

138
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,700
making sure you're fueling up correctly.
And you know,

139
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,940
a hundred mile race is not a question
whether or not you could do it.

140
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:59,150
It's how fast he can do it. Yeah.
You know, it's, it's interesting,

141
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,590
the cool thing in this might go back to
what you asked, like why ultra marathons,

142
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:07,520
and I think it is part of it too, is
like in 100 miles, it's almost like,

143
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:10,870
it's not a matter of when is
something going to go wrong. It's, um,

144
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,250
or I should say,
if something's gonna go wrong,

145
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:16,070
it's a matter of when and how
do you respond to it. Right.
