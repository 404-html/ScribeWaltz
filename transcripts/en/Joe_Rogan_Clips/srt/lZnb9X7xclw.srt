1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,400
Whatever the fuck they did with Jordan
Peterson, they created a god damn monster.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,460
Oh yeah, you guys fucked up. What?

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,640
You guys created a multimillionaire
whose worldwide famous and there's a huge

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,870
bestseller. He was just talking to the
Swedish politicians on TV the other day,

5
00:00:13,871 --> 00:00:16,960
so you know, watch out.
This fucked up with him.

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,200
Boy did they fuck up and Dave
was just texting me a friend.

7
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:23,470
Reuben was just texting me
pictures that all full. It's crazy.

8
00:00:23,471 --> 00:00:25,900
And that energy and that place is crazy.

9
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:30,650
He's selling out 5,000 seat theaters is
a rock star. It's a fucking rock star.

10
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,180
He's an intellectual rock
rockstar. It's hilarious. Good
for him. Yeah. I mean look,

11
00:00:34,181 --> 00:00:36,970
a lot of other guys are doing it to
Sam Harris is doing that now as well.

12
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,970
They do in these gigantic huge speeches.
It's like good for him though. Fine.

13
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,330
We'll absolutely good for him.
But

14
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:49,980
what I'm excited about is how many people
are interested in the debate of ideas

15
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,460
and that this is not happening
on the college campuses,

16
00:00:54,461 --> 00:00:59,200
but a lot of these people
that have graduated have
graduated from college or you

17
00:00:59,201 --> 00:01:03,820
know, or in the working world, they're
very fascinated by this. It's real.

18
00:01:03,821 --> 00:01:07,000
It's what you were saying, it's been
suppressed for long enough now. You know,

19
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:08,740
Jordan Peterson, what was
his thing? He was like,

20
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,010
you're not going to tell me
the words I can use, right.

21
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,050
When there's 78 different
words for genders,

22
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,390
I can safely say you're fucking crazy.

23
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,120
It's like this desperation to try to
find a unique identity that you can

24
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,450
consider it to be super special or
whatever. It's totally, but it's,

25
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,280
and you want to see you even
crazier as you go into the,

26
00:01:27,281 --> 00:01:30,390
like you go on these blogs and I think
they're mostly on Tumblr or something and

27
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,980
it violates my rule.
Never use tumbler. Um,

28
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,400
where they talk about the different
sexual sexuality identities,

29
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,440
like different kinds of, you know,
I'm interested in this kind of person,

30
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,220
but not this kind of person
under these circumstances.

31
00:01:42,221 --> 00:01:44,410
But not under those that has like some,
you know,

32
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,850
18 syllable academic word for it now.
And there's people whose whole,

33
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,880
I don't think their academics,
I think they're activists geeks on Tumblr,

34
00:01:51,881 --> 00:01:55,780
but they come up with these crazy
descriptions and there's like hundreds of

35
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:00,310
sexual orientations. Yeah. It's
just people wanting to be different,

36
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,560
I think sounded be special and
they're not good at anything.
