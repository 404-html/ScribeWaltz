1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,050
Scientific Research.

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,630
I definitely believe that you ever see
trinity and be chatting around, Oh,

3
00:00:04,631 --> 00:00:05,281
you know,
let's,

4
00:00:05,281 --> 00:00:09,450
let's start slow because you didn't go
over so many different things in bombs

5
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:12,660
trying to ignite the atmosphere
and the 1960s. Oh No,

6
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:17,220
I know that the US air force tried to
destroy the atmosphere in 1968. Yes.

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,600
Uh, operations, starfish prime. They
actually did get a nuclear bomb.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,050
They adopted to detonate a
nuclear bomb in the upper.

9
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:26,900
I'm trying to blow up the
rental and renovation.

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,820
They've done a lot of goofy shit.
See that's the thing.

11
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,320
That's why I got mad
at you and I love you.

12
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:33,780
You're a smart guy and everything
is on. You can go, listen,

13
00:00:33,781 --> 00:00:36,300
you got mad at me cause we didn't
communicate all this stuff.

14
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:39,720
I know you're even better at saying it
and then you sit there because you can't

15
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:43,370
handle it and you shake it.
I can. I go now. It's not
that I can't handle it. It's,

16
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,720
there's two factors. One,
I don't have any time.

17
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,150
I don't have enough time to
go into it as much as you do.

18
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,300
You asked why I flipped out and got
mad at you. That's it right there. You,

19
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:54,420
every time I bring up a fucking subject,
you know all about it.

20
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,920
I don't know all about this fucking
know all about six shit, little shit.

21
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:03,800
You're a smart guy, Joe. Joe,

22
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,190
just as a Po Bullshit.
You know exactly what you're,

23
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,250
I don't think you're a bad guy.

24
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,860
You're trying to survive for you
and your family and do good, okay?

25
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,070
But your family,
none of us are going to make it.

26
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,870
There's a post human error coming.
The breakaway civilization,

27
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,150
the deal's been made. It's not,
it's not the third dementia.

28
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:24,540
They've made fricking deals with
interdimensional aliens. Okay,

29
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,870
and notice the media never industry
for that cause that's the truth.

30
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,210
Maybe this is true. I do not know
this and we'll get into it. Okay?

31
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,370
I do not know this and even these human
pig hybrids, Jamie just pulled this up.

32
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:39,270
I believe it's true. I mean, I'm sorry.

33
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:42,750
The Sandy Hook kids die.
My identity is not that I get it.

34
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,010
They admit five g and all the studies
La Times causes massive mutation and

35
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:49,920
cancer. Wait a minute. Wait, minute
really rattles your DNA apart.

36
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,660
All of our kids are under attack.

37
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:55,500
You mean five manager for allowing five
g to come in? This is the new Internet.

38
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,370
You know why they won't let China
put in Wapo you know, swap or major.

39
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,720
That's the big Chinese are on fire today.
No. Let me tell you. Gee, you're on fire.

40
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,880
No, Joe, Joe, the five g
you're on fire. Okay. Okay.

41
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,990
Maybe see article and 96 about human
animal hybrids with pigs and cows. Yes.

42
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,650
You've got to make you part cal. So cal
keeps you. Does it reject it or part pick.

43
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,120
Okay. Okay. But let me expand and,

44
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:20,670
and you know about pigs and rats
were most closely related to us.

45
00:02:20,671 --> 00:02:23,070
Not even chimpanzees. That's why a
lot of the organs don't get rejected.

46
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,810
You know about that? Yes. Okay.
Yes. Pigs are very close to humans.

47
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:31,740
Even use pig organs and piece
will usually know everything show.

48
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,000
No, it's true. I mean, you
know, in a general knowledge,
you know everything I know.

49
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,830
No, no, no. I don't listen to it.
Let me tell you, this is literally,

50
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,850
we know what they're doing. She'll
just like, they say just like they say,

51
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,490
Oh yeah, we had human animal hybrids.
This is like fricking 39 years ago now,

52
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,930
23 years ago. I'm reading in the BBC
about it and go confirm attack. Okay,

53
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:55,823
and they're just floating in.

54
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,420
There was an article in 1999
in the Baltimore Sun and
I interviewed Nick because

55
00:03:00,421 --> 00:03:02,800
she read a Dick McCutcheon and Dominic
mega. She'd know Gotti blow you away.

56
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,940
Who is he? His Dad was a US congressman,
got killed. His brother, US senator, he,

57
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:08,160
he like,
he should have him on the show.

58
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,630
They're the guys that got all the money
given to native Americans and spell his

59
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:13,600
last name. Baggage shits. It's,
it's, it's, he's good friend of mine.

60
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,320
Can I get them on apps? A fricking lift
flyer right now. Anyways, the point is,

61
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,130
so what does he do? He was telling me
all these years ago, he goes, Alex,

62
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,480
it isn't chemicals in the food and water.
That's child's last name again.

63
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,750
Beg It checked. It's not going to worry
about it. Jimmy. It's electro chemical.

64
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,130
Okay,
it's electro chemical,

65
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,620
but I'm reading and the Baltimore Sun
Aftra just had him on and thought it was

66
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:35,950
crazy.

67
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,130
He's giving all these patents for mind
control using wavelengths in microwaves

68
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,420
and I'm sitting there looking at
it and I'm reading it and I'm,

69
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:48,220
and I'm seeing it and the Baltimore
senses the CIA is testing on cell towers,

70
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:53,070
uh, wave links to calm the public
during crises. I just had baggage,

71
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,410
Sean with patents talking about that.
What baggage explains his,

72
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,760
it's not that the microwave.
I have somehow interfaced with the brain.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,750
We already interfaced with the space
winds and all these other magnetic fields

74
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,160
and everything else show.

75
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:09,430
They're all just testing this stuff
and so everything they deployed,

76
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:10,660
they've got all these other technologies.

77
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,530
My Dad was at ut and 65 when he was in
high school. They already had CD roms,

78
00:04:14,531 --> 00:04:16,120
computers,
everything.

79
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:18,790
But they had a nuclear reactor underneath
the building and what supposed to tell

80
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,640
them? Oh absolutely. That's
what I'm telling you.

81
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,360
It's a breakaway civilization dude. We
don't know what they got. We don't know.

82
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:26,890
We don't know who they are. We
don't know. The whole thing.

83
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,400
That's what I'm telling you is this is
hiding in plain view and that's why it's

84
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:34,000
so crazy. Imagine if you knew all this.
You're trying to tell people and they go,

85
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:35,020
Oh God,
he's doing that.

86
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:38,020
Find one thing he did it sounds
mean and make that his whole world.

87
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:42,550
So that's what I'm telling you is it's
been in the newspaper that the cell

88
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:46,510
towers are being used for mind control.
That sounds like a schizophrenia. So see,

89
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,220
here's a, here's where it gets
tougher. I want to see that.

90
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,990
How do they use this salad?
Tongs whole. I'd probably
look, here's the thing. Skits.

91
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,900
Listen,
here's the deal right here.

92
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,380
You've got a total schizophrenia that
thinks the sun is following him around

93
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:59,650
town and thinks their dog is watching
them and works for the aliens.

94
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,980
That's not happening.
You've got someone over here,

95
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,740
someone over here that believes everything
they see on Fox News. Yes. Okay. Yes.

96
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,880
Now questionings.
Good science is good.

97
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:13,000
Trying to figure out what's real and all
of us get freaked out in the nature of

98
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:15,730
the world. No one knows
what the university is. We
don't have all the answers.

99
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,740
So it kind of, people can't handle that
bigness. They can't handle that question.

100
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:21,730
I'll especially low Iq.

101
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,370
So they have to differentiate and create
a model that allows them to put it in

102
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:30,680
boxes so they can make it
make sense because they can't
handle it. It's like, uh,

103
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,691
like I say,

104
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:34,930
even top astronauts space walk for
the first time and they're out in the

105
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:38,980
universe and the whole planet's under
him. And what are they gonna do? They it,

106
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,240
it's mindblowing.
Well,

107
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:44,110
imagine once you realize we don't know
everything we don't understand and it's

108
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,150
endless and there's all this crazy crap,

109
00:05:46,151 --> 00:05:49,030
people go nuts and it's
humans learn more and more.

110
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,490
As we become more advanced
and go to this metamorphosis,

111
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,180
it's going to create a giant societal
crisis where most of the people already

112
00:05:55,181 --> 00:05:59,530
going to get killed. The
globalist understand that
in the birth of this planet,

113
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,260
this new species. And so they decided
to take control, make it scientific,

114
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,460
stun everyone in Denim Noun so they can
scientifically try to orderly carry this

115
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:10,040
operation out. But then I go,
wait a minute, you're detonate.

116
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,420
And over a hundred dollars in bonds,

117
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,450
the upper atmosphere to see if you could
ignite the atmosphere destroying the

118
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:17,270
earth. Yeah, but that
was in the 60s I know,

119
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:20,090
but what I'm telling you is the
same professors train people,

120
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,830
but those people are dead.

121
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:25,670
The people that detonated those hydrogen
bombs in the 60s they're dead now.

122
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,850
Does not. We're not dealing with
the same human beings. I'm with you.

123
00:06:28,851 --> 00:06:33,380
I know people in a lot of ways or more
immoral now I think I agree with you in

124
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:35,930
some ways that everything
evolves and things get better.

125
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,350
This is one of my arguments
about operation Northwoods
that if they were able to

126
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:43,730
push operation Northwoods
and get it signed by the
Joint Chiefs of staff in 1962

127
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,760
was it 62 if they were able to do that
and no one went to jail and no one got

128
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:52,550
arrested for proposing that they were
going to arm Cuban friendlies and have

129
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:56,240
them bomb Guantanamo Bay and blow
up a Cuban jetliner and, and, and,

130
00:06:56,241 --> 00:07:00,890
and shoot people in movie theaters. Yes.
And schools. Yes. That things evolve.

131
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,880
Things evolve. And if unchecked,
and obviously that was unchecked,

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,810
no one went to jail for that. No one
got, you know, even PBS covered it.

133
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:11,210
Like I never even knew this.
Let's read this one here.

134
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:15,320
The significance of the research he
explained is that although the cell phone

135
00:07:15,321 --> 00:07:16,430
power is low,

136
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:21,050
electromagnetic radiation can nevertheless
have an effect on mental behavior

137
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,510
when transmitting at the proper frequency.

138
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,100
What does this article Jamie Scientific,

139
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:28,880
American and scientific American at
the title mind control by cell phone.

140
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,370
So really does have an effect. They
did a whole study. Let's go further.

141
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,333
So there is,

142
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,110
so what do you think that they're
making this classified last year,

143
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,060
a 37 page,

144
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:45,770
she IAA manual from the 1970s where they
were putting up shell towers that look

145
00:07:45,771 --> 00:07:49,360
like trees already testing at
neighborhoods. Okay, the judge,

146
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,140
can I shut the phone,

147
00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:54,620
tracks you and watches you and
controls you and surveil shoe.

148
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,940
You think that that,
that it's one way,

149
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:04,510
but beyond that it's a microwave relay
relay system they can manipulate and then

150
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:09,320
the towers are even more powerful. So
this is a device given to us by the gotch.

151
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,341
Okay.

152
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:15,260
Given to us by the technology that
that the breakaway government,

153
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,880
NASA has developed that you don't just
think they made up themselves. Right.

154
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,760
What do you mean? Who Do
you think made it up? Well,

155
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:25,040
when you're ready to get to it,
I want listeners to understand something.
