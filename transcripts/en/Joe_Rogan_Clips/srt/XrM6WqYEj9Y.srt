1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,570
You're an interesting story man, because
a, not just because your personality,

2
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:07,920
but because you're, you've come back
from mental illness and you very,

3
00:00:07,921 --> 00:00:10,750
very open about it. Yeah.
Know, I think that's, it's,

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,290
that's a very unique thing where I'm,
I remember when you,

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,440
when you beat Klitschko and won the
title and then you kind of went off the

6
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:23,700
rails and I thought you were just
partying. You know, when I heard about it,

7
00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:27,090
I thought, wow, I made a shitload of
money, became the heavyweight champion,

8
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:30,480
all the pressure and the press and all
the craziness. But it was more than that.

9
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,010
It was more than the,

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,090
it started off like I'll suffered with
mental health problems my whole life,

11
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:41,240
but I didn't know what it was. Cause I
never had no education on the mater. Uh,

12
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,020
money wasn't til after the Klitschko
of, hi, I'm very massive hockey.

13
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:48,730
Then I ought to have a even worse hello
Louis slow that anyone could ever have.

14
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:53,320
Um, I'd wake up and I think,
why did I wake up this morning?

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,160
This is coming from my money. You want
everything. Money, fame, glory titles.

16
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,780
Our wife, our family, kids, everything.
But I felt as if I had nothing.

17
00:01:01,781 --> 00:01:06,781
I felt there was an empty gaping hole
that was just filled with gloom and doom

18
00:01:07,271 --> 00:01:10,660
and I just was, one bad thing happened
to me after another, within seven days.

19
00:01:10,661 --> 00:01:14,680
The IBF stripped me of that title because
I couldn't defend against gloves. Golf.

20
00:01:14,681 --> 00:01:17,700
He was a nobody because are
very much closer if Allodynia,

21
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,250
but the IBF wasn't expecting
me to beat Vladimir,

22
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,290
so they took that clause in there anyway.

23
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,800
Thinking bloody may is going to want to
defend against class coffee because I

24
00:01:26,801 --> 00:01:29,350
won. They, they stripped me of the belt,

25
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,370
which then none of my reason within seven
days of the fight. Yeah. That's insane.

26
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,910
How can they require you to fight
within seven? No, they didn't,

27
00:01:36,911 --> 00:01:40,390
but they required me to,
to go into negotiations and you didn't,

28
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,020
so just not going into negotiations to
sign the strip you within seven days.

29
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:44,230
Yeah.

30
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:48,840
But they knew I couldn't go
into negotiations because
already much clothes boxes

31
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,500
a dirty, but I was stuck in between
a rock and a hard place. Yeah. Um,

32
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,520
and that's what happened.
That was one belt, God.

33
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,630
And then my team and the coach,

34
00:01:58,631 --> 00:02:01,300
coach team or carrying all about
where the flight was going to be.

35
00:02:01,301 --> 00:02:04,420
It was going to be on a cruise ship
in Dubai. It was going to be here.

36
00:02:04,421 --> 00:02:08,440
It was going to be there.
Time was dragging on a cruise
ship. A cruise ship. Yeah.

37
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:09,274
There were some ma'am,

38
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,030
Arab billionaire who wanted to make this
fight in exclusive fight for him and

39
00:02:13,031 --> 00:02:16,960
his buddies. No. Uh, come on. Seriously.

40
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,850
This fight was heading for a cruise
ship. That fucking oil money, man,

41
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,480
they've got some money and if they can
afford it, do it. That's what I say.

42
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,540
That would have been the most hilarious
scenario ever for a world heavyweight

43
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:33,470
title fight a bunch of Arab
billionaires on a cruise ship.

44
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:37,603
Wow.

45
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,590
So they strip you of the IBF belt.

46
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,310
You going in negotiation with Klitschko
for the rematch. Rematch never happened.

47
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,360
Pretty much. Didn't happen
initially because I went
over on my uncle in training.

48
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,583
Um,

49
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,870
I was in Harlem training full three
much and I was running up on the heavy

50
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:56,240
terrain and I went, oh, from ankle
sprain, my ankle. Quite badly.

51
00:02:56,241 --> 00:03:00,880
So we had to postpone the folly. But by
that I was off like say three months,

52
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,210
gain his uncle right. And all up. I just,

53
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,360
I just didn't want to do any more of
your army. I didn't have the desire.

54
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:11,380
The fire wasn't burning no longer to
fight and I was suffering with depression

55
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:14,230
the whole time. Even in training
camp before I sprained my ankle,

56
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,160
I was depressed as depressed, could
be on a daily basis. And I think,

57
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,650
why am I feeling like this?
I don't have no reason to feel like it.

58
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,980
Some people will say, oh well each
attention seeking or whatever,

59
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,590
but unless you've
experienced what I'm saying,

60
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,730
it's sort of impossible to understand
where it had been aware of come from.

61
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,660
And it just went from bad to worse.
Um,

62
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,670
I hate the drink heavily on a
daily basis. I hit the drugs. Um,

63
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,270
I was out all night, team of women
of the night and not coming home.

64
00:03:44,271 --> 00:03:46,450
And you know,
I didn't care about boxing.

65
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:48,280
I didn't care about living
at just wanting to die.

66
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,770
I was going to have a good time
doing it while I was doing it.

67
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,240
I used to drink and take drugs to get
away from their depression because when I

68
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:57,700
was drunk or high then I wouldn't,
uh,

69
00:03:57,701 --> 00:04:01,620
I wouldn't think about being depressed
to fall about being a boxing champion or

70
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:05,440
I'm, I feel great. But as we
know when the drink was off,

71
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,670
it only leaves you with a bad
hangover feeling even more depressed.

72
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,740
But someone who suffers
with mental health,

73
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:15,790
the worst thing we can do to escape
it is take drugs or alcohol. But yeah,

74
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:16,930
that's the most common approach.

75
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:21,070
And that's the common approach because
people we don't know cause it's not spoke

76
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:25,960
about. And this is why I want to
spread the word on mental health.

77
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:29,170
So when other people are in
this position in the future,

78
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,260
they know where to go and they know
what to do because there's a blueprint.

79
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,401
Well,

80
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:38,401
Kudos to you for doing that because so
few people have the courage to talk about

81
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:42,160
their struggles when they go through that
because it seems like a weakness. Yeah.

82
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:42,940
You know,
it's,

83
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,930
it's very powerful that you are willing
to do that and just be open and honest

84
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:49,840
about it. There's a few people out
there that are doing that now. You know,

85
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:52,600
our friend moral Rinaldo,
he's gone through some,

86
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:56,500
some serious mental health issues and
he's very open about it and talks about it

87
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:57,880
quite a bit now.

88
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,770
When you were training for the first
Klitschko fight for the fight rather,

89
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,270
did you have it then?

90
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,400
Not really,
no,

91
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:11,401
but I was set focused on what I wanted
to do and that was beat Vladimir

92
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,330
Klitschko.

93
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:17,330
I believe when you've got a goal in mind
or from being a child all your life and

94
00:05:17,941 --> 00:05:20,940
you do that,
then I was like obviously lost.

95
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,060
I was almost like I didn't have
anything more to do in my life,

96
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,910
although I could have carried on and
defended the belt some, whatever.

97
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,790
I wasn't really interested in doing that.
I'd beat them on.

98
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,640
I'd always wanted to do because
when I was an amateur boxer,

99
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,570
I used to watch flood in May, Klitschko
on TV as a world heavyweight champion.

100
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:41,730
And I always aimed, he was my target
to beat and want to finally beat him.

101
00:05:41,731 --> 00:05:46,050
It was like climbing Mount Everest and
didn't have anything more to prove and

102
00:05:46,051 --> 00:05:47,750
the fire was dead.
There was no fire.

103
00:05:47,751 --> 00:05:51,960
I was forcing myself to fight and I always
said I didn't want to be one of those

104
00:05:51,961 --> 00:05:55,980
people who just fought for money because
there's plenty of people with money in

105
00:05:55,981 --> 00:06:00,690
the world, plenty of, but who knows
him? Um, the reasons for me fight,

106
00:06:00,691 --> 00:06:03,470
and it's not for money or,
or for belts or glory,

107
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,250
a fight because I don't
know anything else.

108
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,730
Have always been a fighter from
being born to being 30 years old.

109
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:14,810
Now it's all I love to do. I don't
have any of a passion. I've locked.

110
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,840
The Lord knows I've locked. And if I
had anything else that was going to our,

111
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:21,500
I could do, I'd be doing it.
I just, I tried retirement.

112
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:26,620
I was 27 or retired on the second Monday
in boxing heavyweight history to retire

113
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:29,390
on beaten as a world champion
like rocky Malsiano before me,

114
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,010
but it wasn't enough. I was like,
I am lost without this fight game.

115
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,050
I tried golfing, I tried clay pigeon
shooting. I tried four by four in,

116
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,590
I tried going to strip clubs,
bars, restaurants, everything,

117
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,880
and it was just like I had this emptiness
inside where I just wanted to fight.

118
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,670
Well,
in comparison to what you've accomplished,

119
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,670
everything else has to seem pretty dull.
I mean,

120
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,790
until you step into the ring
with Vladimir Klitschko,

121
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,730
who is widely considered to be one
of the greatest heavyweights ever,

122
00:06:58,731 --> 00:07:02,270
and you boxed his face off. I mean,
that was a beautiful performance.

123
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,470
It was shut him down. It was
weird. It was weird to watch them.

124
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:08,270
It's like there was moments
in that fight where he just,

125
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,220
he just looked like he didn't
know what to do with you.

126
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,330
I'm going to say it again on
December. The first, like I said,

127
00:07:14,331 --> 00:07:16,820
to flood demand has said the
same thing to Deontay wilder.

128
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:22,220
You fought the Americans, you fought the
Mexicans. You fought the Europeans. Paul,

129
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:25,010
you ain't never fought the
gypsy king before. I said,

130
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,470
it's straight Tivola than me. I
said, you look in our king. I said,

131
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,890
who ever for king before? He said, no. I
said, we fight him on now. And he said,

132
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:34,040
you're going to lose to one.
Well he's lost before,

133
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:37,820
but he's lost because he got clipped
and hurt and stopped and I was very

134
00:07:37,821 --> 00:07:41,090
impressed with him actually in the
Anthony Joshua fight because he came back

135
00:07:41,091 --> 00:07:43,460
from getting badly hurt
and almost put Joshua away.

136
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,420
But the fight with you is different
because you just outboxed him.

137
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:51,230
And he was known as the guy who
would box and hold, Jab and hold.

138
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,320
I mean he was one of the most
boring heavyweights of all time.

139
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:58,850
Fantastically successful.
But from a spectator point of view,

140
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,050
you watched some of his fights and like
Jesus Christ, he would jab you, grab you,

141
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,370
Jab and grab you. I mean that was his
thing. Right hand grab you a worked here,

142
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,610
25 title defenses.
I mean it was very successful,

143
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,920
but that shit didn't work with you.

144
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,500
It didn't for the first
time in his whole career,

145
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,320
he was fighting to somebody who
was not just bigger than him,

146
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,920
but more often I take who could move more.
Yeah.

147
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,600
So money wasn't just
looking for one lucky punch.

148
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,360
I knew going into the fight in
me, a flight there, everybody,

149
00:08:26,361 --> 00:08:29,030
all the rest of the opponents
and 25 men before me,

150
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:34,370
I'd a one in trying to do the same thing,
trying to knock him out. And he got,

151
00:08:34,371 --> 00:08:35,460
he's got so many of a,

152
00:08:35,461 --> 00:08:40,280
a weird defense where he puts both arms
out in front of him and it's almost very

153
00:08:40,281 --> 00:08:44,400
awkward to London.
That chain where big punches so far.

154
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,280
I'm not going to do that.
Not gonna make that mistake.

155
00:08:46,281 --> 00:08:50,270
I'm going to outbox him on Ecmo, me
teams. That test is not a good idea.

156
00:08:50,271 --> 00:08:52,210
We've got to go to Germany to try now.

157
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,190
Box a super champion and try and win on
the cards. Are you crazy? I said, yes.

158
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,560
I said,
but if I wasn't crazy I won't be great.

159
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:04,500
And I went over there and outboxed
him. Um, nobody, nobody apart from me,

160
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:08,130
brother or my father fought.
I could do it. You know,

161
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,770
even people who were close to
me and camp there were like,

162
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,500
they were very unsure of
what was going to happen.

163
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,690
I may be me. I always had a little
smile on my face because I believed it.

164
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,650
I believed I could always beat flooding.
Man College go.

165
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,500
I even told Vladimir years
before, when I was 22, I said,

166
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:29,790
I'll beat you one day in manual
steward told him to God, rest his soul.

167
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,510
He said, Tyson fury is the
heir to the throne. He said,

168
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,900
when his time is ready, will beat you
straight to him. Probably me or hate it.

169
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,280
He hated it. Manual talking about me like
her, but he don't it either way. Well,

170
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,960
I'm sure it was good

171
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,130
fire under him during training as well.
Now you,

172
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,710
you were focused for that fight.
You were,

173
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,550
you were prepared and afterwards,

174
00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:00,020
was it just the realization that you
would accomplish this incredible goal?

175
00:10:00,021 --> 00:10:01,400
It's set into depression?

176
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:06,590
Was it you didn't know what to do next
or was it just that your focus was now no

177
00:10:06,591 --> 00:10:09,020
longer on this unattainable?
You know,

178
00:10:09,021 --> 00:10:12,770
like in almost insurmountable obstacle
in front of you becoming the heavyweight

179
00:10:12,771 --> 00:10:16,610
champion of the world. All of a sudden
you did it. Then the depression kicks in.

180
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,660
Yeah.
Molly conditioning train a Christian.

181
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:24,430
He said to me before the clutch go fight.
He said, what will you do after you win?

182
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:29,680
I said, probably be depressed
for a long time. He said, why?

183
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:34,900
I said truthfully as I was
almost expecting it and I
didn't think I'd ever box

184
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:38,830
again. Even the day after the Klitschko
fight, sky's boss interviewed me,

185
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,610
the UK broadcaster, we put it on and
they said, what's next for Tyson theory?

186
00:10:42,611 --> 00:10:47,380
I said, I'll probably never box
again. I knew. I said to me,

187
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:50,830
dad and my brothers before the fight,
a week before the fight, I said, win,

188
00:10:50,831 --> 00:10:52,420
lose or draw.
I said,

189
00:10:52,421 --> 00:10:55,840
this is probably going to be my last
fight cause I knew the fire was going.

190
00:10:55,841 --> 00:10:57,220
I didn't have that hunger anymore.

191
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,330
Had the hunger to beat Vladimir Klitschko
bought not to carry on and continue.

192
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:05,200
And I said I didn't want it to
be about money or financial gain.

193
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,670
I wanted to be the best of my time, beat
the best man. And that's what I did.

194
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,620
And I was a honoring me worded.
I didn't box again until

195
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:19,600
two and a half year later I decided to
make a comeback because I was sitting

196
00:11:19,601 --> 00:11:24,130
here 400 pounds,
drug addict and alcoholic.

197
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:29,110
By the way, I'd never taco drug in my
life until I got to 27 really? Never.

198
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:33,160
Not smoked weed. Not, not morphing.
And what drove three roads?

199
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,770
What were the drugs of choice
once you won the title?

200
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,570
Cocaine was the usual one and that
was it. Really. Cocaine and alcohol.

201
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,290
It's like roll, it goes
crazy. Drug drug and alcohol.

202
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,210
[inaudible] but you know,

203
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,610
I look back on it now and I think
what I changed that I wouldn't,

204
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,350
I'm not many people will,
well,

205
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:55,450
this man's crazy for saying
that on our radio show,

206
00:11:55,451 --> 00:12:00,070
but I wouldn't change a thing because
I know it was supposed to happen and I

207
00:12:00,071 --> 00:12:03,100
needed to be tested to see
what type of character of us,

208
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:07,510
although I did all those mud things and
I went for a wall up time and I tried to

209
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:10,930
commit suicide and I, how'd you
try to commit suicide? Well,

210
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:14,620
I'll tell you what
happened. I, like I said,

211
00:12:14,621 --> 00:12:16,030
I was waking up and I
didn't want to be alive.

212
00:12:16,031 --> 00:12:17,650
I was making everybody's life a misery.

213
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:21,310
Everybody was close to me and was
pushing away. Nobody could talk to me,

214
00:12:21,311 --> 00:12:25,060
talk any sense into me at all.
And

215
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:29,770
I'd go very, very, very
low at times, a very low.

216
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,590
And I start thinking all these crazy
thoughts. And this start near the,

217
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:37,740
and I was in Macau. I bought a, bought
a brand new Ferrari convertible, um,

218
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:43,470
in the summer of 2016 and I was
any animals on the highway on this,

219
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:48,640
a strip of highway where I am, I'm at
the bottom of about a five mile strip.

220
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:53,320
There's a massive bridged across as the
beltway and I knew that and I got the

221
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:58,270
car up to 190 miles an hour hours heading
towards up bridge and I didn't care

222
00:12:58,271 --> 00:13:02,180
what no one will sink in. I didn't care
about her to me family, me, my career,

223
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,450
people who friends, anybody. I didn't
care. I didn't care about nothing.

224
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,910
I just wanted to die so bad.

225
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:11,890
I give up on life and just as it was
getting towards up your ward 90 in his

226
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:14,910
Ferrari in a crushed like a
coke come by way if it a bit,

227
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,950
I heard a voice say no,
don't do this. Tyson,

228
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,300
think about your kids.

229
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:26,560
Think about your family and your little
boys and girls growing up with no father

230
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,360
and everyone saying your dad
was a week mum. He left his,

231
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:35,710
he took the easy way out because he
couldn't do anything about it. And I've,

232
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:39,340
before I turned into the bridge, I, uh,
pulled on the motor and I was shaking.

233
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,910
I could feel myself shaking and I pulled
over and I was all nervous and didn't

234
00:13:42,911 --> 00:13:47,380
know what to do. And I was frightened
and I was so afraid. And the fall,

235
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:51,610
that day, I'll never ever, ever try or
think about taking me on life ever again.

236
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,810
And I didn't. I went and got help
from a delete in psychiatrist,

237
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,210
doctor in the UK and my dad were not with
me. And she said to me that she said,

238
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:06,260
can I have a word alone with
you, John? He said, Ms. Dot.

239
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:10,000
Told me what she said when he came out.
She said, hey, is not to be trusted alone.

240
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,130
He's an imminent death risk.

241
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,920
That's the highest level of suicide risk
that she'd ever assisted. And she said,

242
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:22,390
without his faith,
he would have been dead a long time ago.

243
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,420
But she said faith alone ain't gonna
hold him cause that's going to break.

244
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,960
And once that goes,
he's done.

245
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,630
So without pop me duds life terror as
well because he was checking up on me all

246
00:14:34,631 --> 00:14:35,020
the time.

247
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:40,020
He wanted to be with me 24 seven it was
even sleeping in my house with me and

248
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:44,920
married man before kids. I was
in a right state. I'll just,

249
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,470
I just, I, I want it.

250
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:51,220
I just didn't want to live anymore and
I had everything that a man could want.

251
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,500
There wasn't nothing I didn't have,
but it meant nothing. Nothing meant.

252
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:59,030
And even I felt worthless on the
longer it went on, the more it,

253
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,080
it hurt inside and Amorosa it and
everybody, everybody gave up on me.

254
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,700
Before farm we fall.

255
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:08,820
I was definitely gonna die and I was
going to kill myself and after that I,

256
00:15:08,821 --> 00:15:11,390
I tried. I was thinking to myself, you
know what? I need to get better and eat.

257
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,330
I need to do something.
But every time I tried to go to the gym,

258
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:18,230
I don't know if I say no, they say
for anymore, I'm not going to do this.

259
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,530
I didn't want to do, I'd drum,
I'd run 200 yards and pull up.

260
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,680
I wouldn't even get a mile. I
think. Oh, can't be bothered.
I don't want to do this.

261
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,970
Boxing is not for me.

262
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:30,971
I hated boxing at one stage in 2016
early 17 I wouldn't have done a box in

263
00:15:32,901 --> 00:15:36,710
flight for this room full of
diamonds. No Way. I hated boxing.

264
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,610
I won't watch on the TV. I won't
read about it. I hated boxing.

265
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:45,440
I've done it my whole life and I
didn't want no part of it anymore. Um,

266
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,870
I was out drinking. I didn't gag,
give up taking drugs like I said.

267
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,600
And it come to a point or
was doing that for 18 months.

268
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:58,190
I made a life and I
was out 2017 Halloween.

269
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,500
I was a 400 lbs,

270
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:04,790
dressed up as a skeleton and I go
to this fancy dress party in it.

271
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,880
I'm looking around and I'm thinking,
these are all young kids compared to me.

272
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,390
I'm 30 and I feel like I was the
oldest guy in there like 29 I was like,

273
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,300
what am I doing here?
Is this what you want for your life?

274
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,250
And I thought to myself,
this is not me a number.

275
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:23,230
How many people told me before this
while I was going wrong, what was due?

276
00:16:23,231 --> 00:16:24,260
And you need to act to your life.

277
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,330
You can only change your life
if you want to change it.

278
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,960
And I left and everyone said, are
you going? Oh, early said, yeah.

279
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,020
I left at nine o'clock I went
home and I got back home.

280
00:16:33,021 --> 00:16:35,990
I didn't say anything to the line, but it
went straight upstairs into a dark room

281
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,460
and I took burse. Chief
had skeleton, so tough.

282
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,650
I W I was sat there and I got on my knees
and I was praying and begging God to

283
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:49,370
help me.
And at this point I'd never,

284
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,480
I've never begged or cried
to God to help maybe for her.

285
00:16:52,481 --> 00:16:57,080
I prayed a lot all my life, but I'd
never been in this physical state before.

286
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,570
I could feel tears running down my face.

287
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:04,250
My chest was wet with tears because
I knew I couldn't do it on my own.

288
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:09,870
It wasn't possible for me because I tried
and tried and tried and ended up back

289
00:17:09,891 --> 00:17:11,390
in Nepal.
But drinking,

290
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,530
I almost accepted that that was
going to be my fate and alcoholic.

291
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,830
So I was on my knees in his bedroom.
Um,

292
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,100
after praying for about 10 minutes,

293
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:27,530
I got up and I felt the weight of the
world was lifted off my shoulders.

294
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,290
And for the first time in years I
knew it was going to make a comeback.

295
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,560
And I called my wife,
I said, Paris parish,

296
00:17:35,561 --> 00:17:39,590
it's a ball she follow was drunk
coming home from the pub. I said,

297
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:43,400
Monday morning I started to regain
mission to try and get the heavyweight

298
00:17:43,401 --> 00:17:47,360
championship of the world book. She said,
yeah, yeah, yeah. Because before this,

299
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,070
every time I'd have a beer,

300
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,600
I'd come back and I'm going to be the
heavyweight champion of the world again.

301
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:53,310
Cause it was,
it was the alcohol talking.

302
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:58,650
So I was like the man who called
Wolf a thousand times on this,

303
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,840
this jeep had Korea that I,

304
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:05,670
that I was leaving on the past
thinking about years before glory days.

305
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,820
And after this prior I got up, I
said, all right, this is going to be,

306
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:12,390
she didn't believe me one second, but
even when I speak to her now, she says,

307
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,750
that night you told me that she said, I
earn a difference in your voice swimming.

308
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,953
[inaudible]

309
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:21,720
next day I phoned up
Ben Davison and I said,

310
00:18:21,721 --> 00:18:25,060
I don't want to go back downhill route
when the same trainer, same promoter,

311
00:18:25,061 --> 00:18:27,480
say many things and everything's
got to change as it.

312
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,890
It's going to be a new Tyson fury

313
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,900
and we called it return or
the mock mission and as I
went out that morning after

314
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:39,470
phone in ban and arranging everything and
went out for a run in me sweatsuit out,

315
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,370
I had ambitions of running two miles.

316
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:45,300
I got about five minutes into the wrong,

317
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,280
stopped on a walked
and while I was walking,

318
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:55,050
I can't run on TIF up to 400
pounds before I'm going to walk,

319
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,360
I'm going to get out and walk.
While I was walking,

320
00:18:57,361 --> 00:19:01,800
I was flicking through on my phone on
Instagram and or sees this video of

321
00:19:01,801 --> 00:19:04,470
Deontay wilder say in Yep.

322
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,010
Tyson theories finally done that because
the week before I'd been a boxing show

323
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:09,150
in Manchester or something,

324
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,520
and the press took a picture
on mean it was like everywhere,

325
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:14,170
this big fat out of shape, ugly, bald,

326
00:19:14,171 --> 00:19:17,040
that it bearded white as a sheet mom,

327
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:21,750
I was like a state and Aidan this video,

328
00:19:21,751 --> 00:19:25,860
yet after seeing this evidence at Tyson
fury, I finally know he's finished.

329
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,550
It can never come back.
And if he,

330
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:32,190
even if our water fought him and
he's a day out and knocked him out,

331
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,800
and before that he was
talking about Mike Tyson.

332
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:38,730
Now we'd not Mike Tice and I
went around and I fought myself.

333
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:43,050
That was very disrespectful to talk about
someone who's not even from your era

334
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,110
and one and divide them and all that
sort of stuff when there's no possible

335
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:48,780
chance. So, and stuff. You know
what I've ever do, fight you.

336
00:19:48,781 --> 00:19:49,980
I'm going to give it you for that reason.

337
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,400
And then when I saw this other video of
him saying things about me and that I

338
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:58,401
couldn't come back and he'd give me that
much more motivation to return just so

339
00:19:58,711 --> 00:20:00,060
I can beat Deontay wilder.

340
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,310
So I had all these court cases on as well.
I was being charged.

341
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:09,360
We've taken performance and unseen drugs.
Nandrolone swimming had never done,

342
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,360
I had, I had nandrolone enemies system.
It's fruit juice, naturally antibiotic,

343
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,580
but they say my levels were elevated,

344
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,540
do Uk d UK Anti doping said
there was no case to answer,

345
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:24,350
but all of a sudden I had a big water
case on me that took nearly three years to

346
00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:29,580
sort of tout and by, I mean everyone
said you're getting in Hotmail,

347
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,720
Donnie is on you getting a 12 year
bomb. And I said, you know what?

348
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,880
Well you've been 12 years
not just for an Angelo.

349
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,770
I refused them as well.

350
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:40,950
I was in a bad mood one day and the
drug test and people come in the gym and

351
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:44,400
I've told them to fuck off. This is when
you were training for your comeback?

352
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,320
This was when I was out with training.
Yeah. When I was just all the time,

353
00:20:47,321 --> 00:20:51,790
I was fat and out of shape and not train
and I was still being run them drug

354
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:56,200
tested by UK Aad. Really. That's why
I tested positive twice for cocaine

355
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,210
and everyone said no,

356
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,600
he never getting back the but the boxing
board of control spending my license in

357
00:21:03,601 --> 00:21:05,460
the UK for the cocaine, um, use.

358
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:09,180
So I aren't a court case looking
at [inaudible] band forever.

359
00:21:09,181 --> 00:21:14,181
Basically spantion the doctor
made me medically unfit to fight.

360
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,180
So that was after I forgot about that bit.

361
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:22,050
When I was rescheduling
the Klitschko to fight, uh,

362
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,380
the psychiatrist phoned up and she
says, look, he is medically unfit.

363
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,780
He can't fight anybody, don't
want to live, nevermind fight.

364
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,890
So it was medically deemed unfit to box,

365
00:21:30,891 --> 00:21:34,830
suspended by the box and motor control
for the cocaine use and out an underlying

366
00:21:34,831 --> 00:21:37,980
case on me on a refusal case.
And by the way,

367
00:21:37,981 --> 00:21:40,380
it was racking up millions of
dollars in lawyers' face too.

368
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,530
But I was so confident
that I was going to,

369
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,010
everything was going to be okay
because when I was down on my knees,

370
00:21:48,011 --> 00:21:50,770
I just knew that it was going to
be okay and everyone was like,

371
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,980
what's the point in training and doing
anything with you when you're not,

372
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:56,290
you can't do anything. You're not
in a position to do it. I said,

373
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,120
everything's going to be all right.
Don't worry.

374
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:02,860
Court case comes along in
December. We go. They say, right,

375
00:22:02,861 --> 00:22:06,100
this car case has dragged on
insufficient evidence. Get rid of it.

376
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:10,180
We both agreed that we was going to call
it quits on the case and I go my way.

377
00:22:10,181 --> 00:22:14,200
They got as they pay their legal
fees, I pay my legal fees. Dawn,

378
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:19,180
that was a drugs case out the
window. Finished the suspension.

379
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,870
I had a meeting with the border
control in the UK and they said, look,

380
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:27,640
if if you can get past medically
fit by doctor mentally,

381
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:33,070
then we'll reassess your case. I'm telling
and denied. So I said, right, no problem.

382
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,590
I phoned up with a psychiatrist
or seeing people who would,

383
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,060
who had spoke to all these doctors,
three or four different doctor, Phil's,

384
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:43,270
Dr. Jones, whoever else said, or
I need to, I need reassessing,

385
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,630
reassess me, Bang, pass
with flying colors.

386
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,590
I went back to the border control
handed in my certificate by all these

387
00:22:50,591 --> 00:22:54,010
different doctors, examinations,
physical and mental. They said,

388
00:22:54,011 --> 00:22:56,680
we have no other choice but to give
you a license reinstated, Bang.

389
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,130
So it was three of the biggest
obstacles in my life at once.

390
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,740
We're all done within a
month or two straight away.

391
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,910
Then not just an easy
task of losing 160 pounds,

392
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,600
whichever of got overall I'm other things.

393
00:23:10,601 --> 00:23:13,570
Losing weight as a fighter was something
that I'd done that tron. Anyway,

394
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:18,940
so that me and Ben sat about losing this
hundred and 60 pounds along the way.

395
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:23,050
Back home. Spoke to Frank Warren. He
became the promoter I'm frank had, right?

396
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,360
You've had a long time at the ring.
You've abuse your body.

397
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,780
Let's get your four or five comeback
fights just so you're ready. I said, okay,

398
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,870
no problem. How one called might
fight hard, the other combat fight.

399
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:38,590
I said to frank, I don't need any more
combat fights. Make the wild of right now.

400
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:43,270
No, no, no, no, no. He said, let's have
a couple more just in case. I said,

401
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:47,260
I'm telling you, make the wild a fight.
So this is where people don't understand.

402
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:51,070
I've picked Deontay wilder. He
didn't pick me. I picked him.
