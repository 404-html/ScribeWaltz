1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,290
With, we have a hierarchy of life,
things that are closest to us,

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,160
we feel more connected to.
We don't feel connected at all to bugs.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,850
Nobody gives a fuck about right.
Vegan slap mosquitoes all day long.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,550
Nobody gives a shit about that life.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,790
But there is a life that you care
about when things get warm and

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,290
they get like too close to us. Yeah. When
they, when they get too close to mammal,

7
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:23,560
like people freak out.
Yeah.

8
00:00:23,561 --> 00:00:27,680
I went on a South African safari
last year and it was like, ew,

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,680
I couldn't fathom someone going and
hunting a leopard or something like that.

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,950
That's a weird thing. That's a big
game. Shit. That's a very weird thing.

11
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:37,980
It's a very different thing.
It's not, it's not a, it's a,

12
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,630
it's almost like what that is.
And I'm not saying it shouldn't sadism,

13
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,190
maybe a little,

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,360
but what that is is like
it's an aberration off the
original idea and it is,

15
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:51,720
this is the only way to look at it.

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,240
And people would get mad at me that are
hunters cause I'm a hunter and like what

17
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:55,074
do you say?
Look,

18
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,550
it's not the thing to do unless
you're doing it on PR just to control

19
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:04,530
population. There's no
reason to do it, but what,

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,770
what happened was in the past,

21
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:12,060
the only reason people hunted was from me.
You barely could stay alive anyway,

22
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,640
and when you went on a hunting party,
he didn't go for sport.

23
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,350
You went to go to kill things.

24
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,060
When you have so much food that you
don't need to worry about food and you've

25
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:23,100
already been shooting all these animals,

26
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:25,680
then they start doing
these things called slams.

27
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,070
They called doing super
slams are the grand slam.

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,610
There's a dall sheep slam is a sheep slam,
a rocky,

29
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,680
like a big horn sheep slam. There's a
wise, like a Gymboree. No, no, no. You,

30
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,620
you try to kill one representative
of each of the subspecies. God,

31
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,180
really? Yeah. It's a big thing.
It's a big thing with these guys.

32
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:46,920
It's a poker run calm like the,
the,

33
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,780
the big six are the big eight in
Africa. Africa. It's a big five.

34
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,190
Is that what it is? The Big Five, the five
most dangerous animals to hunt on foot.

35
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,920
It's like Cheetah Lion,
hippo,

36
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,250
Rhino and that whatever the fuck leopard.

37
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:08,430
That brick. Yeah. There's a bunch of these
kind of slams. They haven't for Turkeys.

38
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,550
They have a wild Turkey slam.
You get the Gould's Turkey,

39
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:14,040
get the Osceola Turkey.

40
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:17,070
There's a bunch of different turkeys
all over the country. One in Florida.

41
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,540
There's one in Mexico.

42
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:23,130
It's different Turkey point being
people start collecting and it gets,

43
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:26,580
it gets weird. Well that's the
trophy, right? Yeah. It's weird.

44
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,150
It's like it gets to this weird place
like you don't think they shouldn't do it.

45
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,240
Like, okay, are you eating the
Turkey? You are. Okay, that's cool.

46
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,240
Are you eating the deer? Yup.
Okay, well then I have no quarrel,

47
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,960
but when you start going like lie in hose,

48
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:44,130
I said Cheetos. Elephant was
the other one. Yeah. Yeah man.

49
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,190
I mean the only reason why I shoot an
elephant is if the elephants going on a

50
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:50,310
rampage through her village telling
people and you want to protect people's

51
00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:52,860
lives and I'm on team people.
Other than that,

52
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,730
why the fuck else would you
shoot an if I have no idea, like

53
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,070
I saw the elephant that
the biggest elephant I've

54
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:04,200
ever seen as far away from me as you
were sitting right now, my God and I all,

55
00:03:04,201 --> 00:03:06,790
I almost had a heart attack yet.
Africa on a safari.

56
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,720
See,
but I think those things are amazing.

57
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,760
It was amazing. It was amazing. But like
you just know because what you're doing,

58
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,820
the reason I was so close is because we
were watching them push trees down with

59
00:03:20,371 --> 00:03:24,130
their trunks,
like four or five inch trees just from,

60
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,650
Oh my God. Like it's nothing.
You know what I mean?

61
00:03:28,651 --> 00:03:31,110
Like you'd crash a car
if you hit one of those,

62
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,450
it would crash the car and
like they're just phone,

63
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,800
phone and they're right next to you
and if they go thumb on your jeep,

64
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:38,634
that's the end of that.

65
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,920
You know what's complicated?

66
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,180
Someone was trying to explain this to
me and I should really be honest about

67
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:45,390
this. A guy was trying to explain
to me that when we think of Africa,

68
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,490
we think of a country,
it's not a country.

69
00:03:47,491 --> 00:03:50,370
It's a continent and it's a way
bigger confidence in North America.

70
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,380
We've seen pictures of United States
stuck in the middle of Africa.

71
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,590
Africa is fucking huge.
And he's like,

72
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,920
unfortunately there's places in Africa
where they have over populations of

73
00:03:58,921 --> 00:04:02,700
elephants and they encroach on human
civilization and they do have to hire

74
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,550
hunters to come in and do it and
kill him. Well, they don't hire him.

75
00:04:05,551 --> 00:04:08,850
The hunters pay and the money
goes straight to the village.

76
00:04:08,851 --> 00:04:12,150
The meat goes to a village and people
get very excited about people hunting

77
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,050
these elephants.
And when

78
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:17,870
probably seems like a sort of short term
solution to the village, right? They,

79
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,990
the village doesn't give a shit
about the elephants. They want their,

80
00:04:20,991 --> 00:04:21,660
they want to eat,
eat

81
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,380
probably. Right. Well
they can eat their crops.

82
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,240
It becomes a big issue and they eat
the fuck out of there. You know,

83
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:30,811
like good luck.

84
00:04:30,811 --> 00:04:35,580
They only got him LFO now given no chance.

85
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,270
So when someone was explaining
this to me, I remember, you know,

86
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,570
we were saying this,
I was like,

87
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,400
why the fuck would you ever
want to kill an elephant?

88
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,340
We know there's not that many
of them. And he's like, yeah,

89
00:04:44,341 --> 00:04:47,040
this is why it's complicated.
There's not that many of them.

90
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:50,850
In some places it's like in
La there's no grizzly bears,

91
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,790
but if you go to Montana or the people
that live in Montana or go into, hey,

92
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,060
when are you going to start
hunting these fucking things?

93
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,010
They just declared them open for uh,
in Wyoming,

94
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,270
they're, they're not, they don't have,

95
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,790
they think they just started a hunting
season and it's very controversial and

96
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:13,680
they just end date. No, no, not anymore
at all. No. They have a lot of them.

97
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,510
And the people that live up there,

98
00:05:15,511 --> 00:05:17,890
especially people that have been mauled
or know people that have been molded

99
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,260
like, hey, fucking
enough enough. I get it.

100
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:27,360
They made a great comeback. But
you know, if you're in Chicago,

101
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:31,500
the zero bears, so if, and this is a
tiny place in comparison to Africa.

102
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,130
So when I was saying that like,
I thought that elephants were endangered.

103
00:05:35,131 --> 00:05:37,050
He's like,
yes and no.

104
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,550
There are endangered in some areas
and good point to fucked up point.

105
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,580
The most dark point about all of it is
that trophy hunting is the only thing

106
00:05:46,861 --> 00:05:49,380
that keeps those animals healthy.
This is what's fucked up.

107
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,190
I was talking to my plane campaigns
about this this weekend when,

108
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,170
and this is what I say,
trophy hunting.

109
00:05:55,171 --> 00:06:00,171
I'm even talking about normal hunting
meat like impalas or you know Elan's.

110
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,400
He's big. He's a big game animals that
people hunt for cause they're delicious.

111
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,250
Even them in Zimbabwe.

112
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,760
There's a lot of areas in
Zimbabwe that are not high fence.

113
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,560
They're just open enormous areas.

114
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,660
All of the money that would come from
people hunting there would sustain these

115
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:20,240
local areas,
sustain these lodges.

116
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,080
So it would make it viable to
keep these animals alive and stop.

117
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:28,220
Poachers responds the anti
poaching, right? Exactly.

118
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,090
The only thing that funds
the anti poaching. So here's
what happened. The Cecil,

119
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,290
the Lion Shit went down.

120
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,040
Nobody wanted to go to Africa anymore to
go hunting and all of these businesses

121
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:40,480
are going under,
so there's nothing stopping the poachers.

122
00:06:40,481 --> 00:06:43,780
So the poachers move in and kill
everything, kill everything.

123
00:06:43,781 --> 00:06:48,260
Thought that the other ways, how many
elephants were killed last year by people?

124
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:53,261
Something like 400 or Google
this legally killed elephants.

125
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,690
The number of illegally kill elephants,
30,000 come on.

126
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:04,400
30,000 most of them are killed illegally.
Most of them are poached.

127
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,140
They have this one elephant,

128
00:07:06,141 --> 00:07:09,380
you know that last elephant that
was dying the mail or excuse me,

129
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,190
Briahna Reinstein White Rhino or black
rhino? We try. No, was it a black rhino?

130
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:17,540
I think they have that, that poor
bastard with armed guards around it.

131
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,720
24 seven because they were worried
someone's going to kill it,

132
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:22,550
shoot it and cop chop
the fucking horn off.

133
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,410
Like the poaching is way scarier than
the hunting and the only thing that

134
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:30,230
protects the animals
from poaching is hunting.

135
00:07:30,231 --> 00:07:34,610
It sounds so on where to
live and so forth, but you
have to look at it honestly.

136
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:38,820
Yeah. They said something similar to us in
South Africa about that, that, that the,

137
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:43,090
the, they need the funds
because of the anti poachers,
you know, they, they, they're,

138
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,310
they're all over the place.
And then here's the other problem.

139
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,190
When you say poachers,
these poachers,

140
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,790
you know what you're really saying poor
people. That's what you're really saying.

141
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,050
They're poor,
desperate people.

142
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:57,140
They don't know what the fuck to do and
if they could chop off a rhino's horn

143
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:58,520
and make some money,
they're going to do it.

144
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,760
If they can shoot that animal
that's not theirs and use it for me,

145
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:05,300
they're going to do it. They're starving
to death. I mean they have no options.

146
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,870
There's a pitch people in parts of
Africa that are living in grass huts.

147
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,980
My Buddy Justin wren,

148
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:14,000
he goes and makes wells for these people
in the Congo and the stories he tells

149
00:08:14,001 --> 00:08:17,870
you would just make your eyes tear up
these the human beings and they're living

150
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:22,460
like this 24 hours a day for their entire
life. And this is, this is the norm.

151
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,880
So we're talking about poachers will be
talking about people that are fucking

152
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,340
desperate. Yeah, you
can call them poachers.

153
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,620
You could dehumanize them with that term,

154
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:33,560
but they're just poor people and
the only way, or none of them,

155
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:36,620
the movie stereotype poachers
somehow to be a couple, some of them,

156
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,930
but most of them aren't.
Now here's what's even crazier.

157
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:44,020
Most of the anti poaching agents used to
be poachers cause it's nothing else for

158
00:08:45,031 --> 00:08:46,550
them to do. Yeah. That's not surprising.

159
00:08:46,551 --> 00:08:49,970
Now they're poachers again
cause but they're hunting
people that got out of jail

160
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,320
that got out of this position that can't
be anti poaching memorial. They can now.

161
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:56,640
They just now they, I come
poachers again. Perfect.

162
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,260
This happens to a lot of it's gone well.

163
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,500
When Cam Haines was explaining this to
me and when does he explain it to me?

164
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:02,334
I'm like,
well course.

165
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,940
So they don't even know how many animals
were left in these areas where people

166
00:09:04,941 --> 00:09:08,610
who have abandoned them, ranches
that were once thriving ways to see.

167
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:11,340
The thing is most of these animals,
a good percentage of it,

168
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:14,510
we're on the verge of extinction just 30
years ago because people were just over

169
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:16,860
hunting them and coaching them and
doing whatever they want it to them.

170
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,190
Then they started putting value on them.
People would go over there to hunt them,

171
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:24,240
so people would keep these huge areas
in that populations boomed because they

172
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:29,070
were taking care of them
because they were, they were
a resource, and this is key.

173
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,400
This is conflicting to people.
It's wild. It's very wild.
