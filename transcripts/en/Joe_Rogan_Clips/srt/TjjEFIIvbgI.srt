1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,440
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:07,030
I can do a lot in 1975
with $1,000 with two kids.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,550
My grandmother was
obsessed with the numbers.

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,990
She was obsessed and she
would always have like, um,

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,050
numbered her head that she thought it was
going to be and it was like one off or

6
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:19,330
something like that. It was like
these stories she would tell you.

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,440
What would you say? What
can I say? I was like five.

8
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,770
I just remember it very distinctly.

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,780
My grandmother went to jail for running
numbers in New Jersey. She wouldn't,

10
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:35,890
she wouldn't rat him out. So they put
her in jail. So she made sweaters,

11
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,340
gave sweaters to the guards.
Mrs D, She's the nicest lady.

12
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:43,210
Do you feel that your grandmother
had done time? What did you think?

13
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,470
We didn't find out until I was probably
like, I wonder when I found out,

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,990
I think maybe I found out my
teenage years and I was like, why?

15
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,030
What the fuck people would go
to see her? Like, where's a,

16
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,370
I don't want to say my grandma's name
and a respect, but people would say,

17
00:01:00,371 --> 00:01:04,430
you know, where is she? Oh, she went
to visit her, her cousin her is,

18
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,620
she wants to see her aunt and she's,
you know,

19
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,150
she's in the pokey for like six months.
I forget how much time it was,

20
00:01:10,151 --> 00:01:12,190
but every time we'd go over there
there's like some new excuse,

21
00:01:12,191 --> 00:01:17,060
see it in New Jersey, then punch it in New
Jersey. They put you in jail for again.

22
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,230
I get to New York City, they don't,
they give you a ticket, you know,

23
00:01:20,231 --> 00:01:22,450
they would give you like a ticket
in the shit and those days,

24
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,060
I don't know what it's like now.
This fucking,

25
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,030
they'll throw you in jail for weed down
in New York City. I don't fucking know.

26
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,950
My grandmother was one of the few people
I've ever known where I legitimately

27
00:01:32,951 --> 00:01:36,820
thought they had intuition.
She has weird intuition.

28
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,730
She would do things.
It's real weird.

29
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:44,320
Like when my mother was a a kid,
it was a rainstorm.

30
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,340
I was like real bad rainstorm and for
whatever reason my grandmother decided to

31
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:51,070
wake my mother up, take her out of
her bed and bring her downstairs.

32
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,300
Some crazy hunch.
She had the ceilings,

33
00:01:55,301 --> 00:02:00,040
claps like right above the bed where
my mom was sleeping. So like pieces of,

34
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,190
you know, it wasn't a lot, it was just
chunks of plaster, but like, you know,

35
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:07,780
three or four pretty significant pieces
of plaster fell off of the ceiling.

36
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,030
It was rain came through
with the whole deal.

37
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,810
I'll just sealing gave out and somehow
or another she had this idea in her head

38
00:02:13,811 --> 00:02:17,560
and it could be because she knew that
the ceiling was fucked up and she knew it

39
00:02:17,561 --> 00:02:18,311
was raining hard.

40
00:02:18,311 --> 00:02:22,180
It was probably going to give in any way
or she might've had an intuition and my

41
00:02:22,181 --> 00:02:24,490
fault, everyone was always
convinced it was intuition.

42
00:02:24,491 --> 00:02:27,310
Everyone's always convinced like
she's like a little bit psychic.

43
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,750
It was always weird. It was always
weird around there. Well because shaky,

44
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:35,470
the shame about her monkey. No, she
had a month and New Jersey. Yes,

45
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:38,830
in north New Jersey. She had a monkey
named Chichi and cheats you a bite.

46
00:02:38,831 --> 00:02:40,090
Everybody.
But my grandma,

47
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,800
my grandfather made and keep the monkey
in the attic. Y'All. My grandma was crazy

48
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,093
z.

49
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,310
She had a monkey would open up
packages a gum and chew gum.

50
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,020
How or where the fuck she got it
from? Bottom up. I'm telling you,

51
00:02:58,021 --> 00:03:02,740
my grandma was crazy. Italian people had
butches days and they get you anything.

52
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,910
She Kelly Gaina pigeon. She
kept a monkey in the house, man.

53
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:10,170
Do you understand how crazy then you
remember the monkey? Yes. Cheat Sheet.

54
00:03:10,171 --> 00:03:13,450
The monkeys came as cheesy bites. You
know he never bit me. He bit my sister.

55
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:18,550
He bit my sister. Yeah. Cheat. You would
fuck you up. I think he bit my sister.

56
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,010
I think he tried to bite my sister.

57
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:23,740
I think it was one of those things
they might have bit my cousin

58
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,280
in our family got pit.
That's dumb.

59
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:33,480
I couldn't see the side.
No Italian side. Yeah.

60
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,920
Then she was crazy and once you give,
no disrespect,

61
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:41,470
but once you get those little ticks,
that option that they do have intuition,

62
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:47,120
you're fucking done. They start
giving you the fish eyes. Dude,

63
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,730
don't do shit. You got listened to.
Her cooking was from another planet.

64
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,710
It's from another planet.
It was like pure immigrant cooking.

65
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:01,690
Like the pasta that loves design.
Yeah. You just sit there and go,

66
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:05,680
Holy Shit.
Just perfect.

67
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:10,480
Just knew exactly what to post to
be in there. She baked her own,

68
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:15,140
like she would make her own macaroni,
should make our own Ravioli.

69
00:04:15,141 --> 00:04:16,450
She would stuff her own Ravioli.

70
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:19,660
She'd be out there role in and
flatten out flour and shit,

71
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,860
throwing the flower on top of it,
flatten it out. She was a wizard though.

72
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:25,820
He should get a monkey,
call it cheat TD.

73
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,390
Gotta respect a little
monkey and keep her head dog.

74
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,390
Either respectful or grandma.
My grandma was a special lady.

75
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,550
She was powerful once you give those.

76
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,870
So when I was a kid, man, I went to
my buddy's judo school. I didn't join.

77
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:43,100
I just went down there to see what it was
like. And it was hidden in union city.

78
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,780
It was on seventh street,

79
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,320
but I knew that my stepdad played
cards on ninth street on Wednesdays.

80
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,530
Wow. Okay. I knew my stepdad played
cards down and they played baccarat.

81
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:55,761
Okay.

82
00:04:55,761 --> 00:05:00,761
And they'd gamble in this little club
and I had to be maybe 10 but because I

83
00:05:00,771 --> 00:05:04,850
grew up, how I grew up with the numbers,
I always had my eyes out as a kid.

84
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,400
When I went to judo that met at the end,

85
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,360
I got on the bus to go back and
I noticed unmarked police cars

86
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,290
and I went home that night and look bro,
you know,

87
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:20,291
made dog get Christie love used to be a
show on ABC about a black chick that new

88
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:23,570
martial arts and tried to
capitalize on it with a sister.

89
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,710
And she was good looking with an Afro
when she was a cop that she'd come in and

90
00:05:27,711 --> 00:05:31,790
do karate moves on Wednesday nights at
nine or 10 o'clock and you caught me at

91
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,150
home watching get Christie,

92
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,180
I'll never forget that my stepdad was
leaving that night and for some reason I

93
00:05:38,181 --> 00:05:40,210
know you're going to play back home
after that. And he looked at me,

94
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:44,150
he was getting dressed or suit on. Yeah,
like the Billy bad Sudan and the shit.

95
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,590
You're going to play cards or five men.
Why are you getting dressed to the nines?

96
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,870
And I said to him, I said, hey man,

97
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:55,130
today I went down and let it
go to Martins judo school.

98
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,710
And I saw a bunch of them marked
cards down there. If I was you,

99
00:05:57,711 --> 00:06:01,250
I wouldn't go out to that.
And He fucking just looked at me.

100
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,850
He said, I love you. And he walked down
the stairs. He got in the car, started it,

101
00:06:05,851 --> 00:06:07,130
opened the garage bro.

102
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,510
And 10 minutes later I heard the car
turned off in the garage close and he came

103
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:12,740
up and he goes,
I think you're right.

104
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:17,690
And he made Sundays for me and him and
next morning and that card place I got

105
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,240
raided. So now they would listen to me. I,

106
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,070
I had these fucking
morons out that my spouse.

107
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,690
But you want me to tell you what
else did Joe Rogan like? This is me.

108
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:32,750
And like me and my stepdad
had this weird relationship.

109
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:36,890
I got to an age where I wanted my
mother from myself. You know what?

110
00:06:36,891 --> 00:06:39,110
The feeling is dry when
we've all gone through it.

111
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:44,120
When you lose a dad and your mom remarries
that comes up a day that he's not

112
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:47,450
going to tell you what's going on anymore.
And you know what?

113
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,890
I just want you to know that I'm the
motherfucker that runs this joint.

114
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,620
You might be sleeping with my mum,
but I run this motherfucker.

115
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,730
So once I gave him that advice,
like it really for a while,

116
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,690
then him and I would go in a float.
I kept stealing his coins from the center.

117
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,500
He had this sand Laszlo thing
and that was everything to him.

118
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:11,270
So he had this big bottle of like scotch
that was empty and he would put silver

119
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:13,350
dollars in there and I would steal them.

120
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,720
And from time to time he would come home
and go, that bottle's looking light,

121
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:22,160
somebody stealing,
destroying his mind for years,

122
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:27,560
because he was a very particular man.
So he had different bundles of my life.

123
00:07:27,561 --> 00:07:28,191
I'll tell you something,

124
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:32,690
I respect them today because I saw him
get out of the joint and I show what he

125
00:07:32,691 --> 00:07:36,620
did with bookmaking and how he
became partners on a butcher shop.

126
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:40,880
I started businesses, he started
different businesses. So, uh,

127
00:07:40,881 --> 00:07:44,600
after I saved this that night with the
backer rock, he would listen to me.

128
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:50,140
And then one day I went and I signed up
for bitty basketball and union city and

129
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:52,850
they used to give, you know,
like now if you sign your kid up,

130
00:07:52,851 --> 00:07:54,140
you've got to pay any dollars.

131
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,340
In those days you just show up at an
address and they gave you a tee shirt,

132
00:07:58,341 --> 00:08:00,920
they put you on the team and they
gave me a number. They said like,

133
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:05,660
you didn't say department of recreation
and was a purple shirt. My number was 57.

134
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,410
I walked in the house and he goes,
what do you got there? And I go, Oh,

135
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:12,830
I joined the basketball thing and he
goes, what number is? And he goes,

136
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:17,570
57 Cubans again, a very
superstitious 50, 70 goes,

137
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,650
put a number on that. And he
picked up the phone. I go five.

138
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:26,390
He called some guy and he goes, give
me five 57 for $10. Guess what happens?

139
00:08:26,391 --> 00:08:29,150
Your rug, what happened?
The number came up. No,

140
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,940
I really had them under my spell right.
The fuck out.

141
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:36,530
Said I had this motherfucker at the
age of 12, so he would listen to me.

142
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,580
How old was the guy?
My stepfather,

143
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:45,430
Juan at the time was 47.
Did Not drink. Get imagine,

144
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:48,410
did not drink, did not do
drugs. Carry the straight razor.

145
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:52,280
Joe Rogan a straight razor to cut
people. Yeah. And he used to cut,

146
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,500
you use the web carpenter
pants with the stray raise.

147
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:59,430
At this point the guy had money,
he would have a gold chain.

148
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,480
He wear a Chinese tee shirt, which a
lot of people do not know what it is.

149
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,690
That's what real pimps where there's
silk and may shirts from China that you

150
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:11,160
went and they have three little buttons.
Well,

151
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:12,720
when you were real motherfucking Spec,

152
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,410
you cut those buttons and you get your
initials and you put them in gold with

153
00:09:16,411 --> 00:09:20,060
diamonds in it. That's how
speaks ran in those days. Well,

154
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,820
and uh, once I had them there, Joe
Rogan, I had him, he trusted me.

155
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:28,260
He trusted my eyes.

156
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:32,910
So one night we're in union city and I
fucking went somewhere on the walk back,

157
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,960
there's a place called pastoral music and
there was next to the new moon Chinese

158
00:09:36,961 --> 00:09:41,820
restaurant and I saw a bunch of unmarked
cars and I'll never forget that.

159
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:44,580
I went back to the bar and then he'd
go out and I told him, I said, dog.

160
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:48,070
I saw three on my, like I
had him and I go, that's him.

161
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,240
I seen three on my cars up the corner.

162
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:54,900
He was very always scared of the
phone even though he was a bookmaker,

163
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:55,950
he never used the phone.

164
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,420
Joe Rogan never used the phone and he
would never have a conversation close to a

165
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:05,100
phone. This is because he always
felt he didn't let him like phones.

166
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,560
He did everything like a pigeon.
His,

167
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,300
he would write the numbers and the
little piece of paper real small and fold

168
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:15,300
them up and put him in his hat.
And if he ever saw cops,

169
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:19,620
he would just eat a piece of fucking
paper. He didn't give a fuck.

170
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,950
He always had the piece
of paper somewhere close.

171
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,660
Sometimes you will put it in this ring.
This motherfucker was a savage. Oh my God.

172
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,990
So that might, the cops were
going to jump on us on the bar,

173
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,250
but it was for a drug thing. It wasn't
for him. But when I went back, I told him,

174
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:38,550
listen,
the cops are up to corner and me and him,

175
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,200
he grabbed me by the hand and him and
I walked from 29th in Bergen Line,

176
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,700
the 58th and Bergen line down the Hudson
telling different bar owners that there

177
00:10:47,701 --> 00:10:51,930
was going to be a raid. Like that's
how are untrustworthy. He was a phones.

178
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:57,270
By the time we got back to the bar,
we got raided and there was a dude in,

179
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:01,950
his name was Monina.
Right. Monina is those, uh,

180
00:11:01,951 --> 00:11:06,000
those crazy Cubans that I've acquired.
Monina means good man.

181
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:10,110
Like y'all my bra. Yeah, the albacore
while they're the ones that only pussy.

182
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,380
And then he puts a,
and they fucking,

183
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,830
you can't fuck around with animals because
they're saying Lazarus and all that

184
00:11:16,831 --> 00:11:20,430
show. They have a very specific religion.
Yeah. They have their ma. It's a manhood.

185
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:24,150
They were longshoremen and Cuba.
And they maintain order,

186
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,080
so we have a fuck up. They'd come
over and fuck you up. There was,

187
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,350
but he had a wig.
I'll never forget this.

188
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:35,970
The Guy Monina had a wig and the cops were
there and they threw him and I'm like,

189
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:37,800
12 dog.
I'm up against the wall,

190
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,290
the search and made through
the search and my step dad,

191
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,320
they got my mom and they went to Monina
and they searched him and the cop looked

192
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,960
at his work and he goes,
check the wig.

193
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,930
And they pulled the wig off and he had
a little aluminum foil, weed, cocaine.

194
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:57,280
Oh my God. Oh my God. That's hilarious.

195
00:11:57,281 --> 00:12:01,510
That whole bookmaking numbers world
is fucking nuts that I grew up in.

196
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:02,410
I love it still.

197
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:12,520
Okay.
