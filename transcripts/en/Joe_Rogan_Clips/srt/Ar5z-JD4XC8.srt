1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,570
That's my goal, to make them
happy all the time. When he died,

2
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:07,600
was it weird not having a
person? Oh man, it was so man,

3
00:00:07,601 --> 00:00:10,030
it was just emptiness.
It was just,

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,970
and then people who we thought with our
friends and that we say we're going to

5
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:16,270
be good too. They started when he died,
they had started going in for the kill.

6
00:00:16,271 --> 00:00:18,820
You just want to ask me for means.

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,210
Well it seemed like you and Kevin Rooney
had a good combination at the beginning

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,390
when he died,
when when customers,

9
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:28,580
we didn't know what we're going to do.

10
00:00:28,581 --> 00:00:30,350
They're thinking about
getting rid of Kevin and,

11
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,570
and I was thinking I didn't
want to be with nobody else.

12
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,800
Everybody was comfortable with Kevin and
the style and the way we were going to,

13
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:38,620
I didn't want to be an oil, so I
said, no, let's just keep Kevin. Yeah.

14
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:42,670
And Kevin was a great change for me.
Very well respected trainer. Yeah.

15
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,140
It was a good relationship.

16
00:00:44,141 --> 00:00:48,790
Like the way it worked in the beginning
it looked like, but then like all things,

17
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,660
you know, Kevin used to train me and
then fighting our finances and the it.

18
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,610
Oh really? Yeah. Wow. Wow.

19
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,050
And this was all like w w was
he training you? Um, before,

20
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:07,090
before Kostayan as well? Well yeah. How
many, how many years before Christ died?

21
00:01:07,091 --> 00:01:11,380
Was he like holding myths for you and
if the couple, but he knew you well.

22
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,830
Did he watch well?
Did he watch fights with you as well?

23
00:01:14,831 --> 00:01:17,650
Did you or were you watching
those fights to fight the,

24
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,920
with Liam started
training with each other.

25
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,710
We started watching fights
together because you're star,

26
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,600
that was the other thing to your style.

27
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,680
The way you would come out
was so reminiscent of old
fighters and when you come

28
00:01:29,681 --> 00:01:33,460
out and no socks on black shoes.
Wow. That would think in my mind.

29
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,660
I think it was a lot about
gladiator NBA toughing it out.

30
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,600
Another thing now look at it now for
looking at Philly. Philly kid. Thank you.

31
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,710
Tough. I don't think I look at it.
Thanks Tom. Where you are tough man.

32
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,260
I know what you're saying. I know
what you're saying. But you were,

33
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,870
when you fought Marvis
Fraser on what does the ABC,

34
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,500
I remember watching that fight
going. Holy Shit. Holy Shit.

35
00:01:57,501 --> 00:02:01,710
It was like being locked into a ring
with a tornado. That was wild day. Yeah.

36
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,740
That was a tough kid. That was your
peak. That was when it was peak. Scary.

37
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,320
You know, you were coming up and
everybody was just terrified.

38
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,930
It was just a wild thing to watch man
to be a part of it. To be you. Yeah.

39
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:18,070
One of the, I make my mentor happy though.
That was my main goal and fighting.

40
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,460
It's a powerful goal.
Yeah.

41
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,430
Did you ever try to go back and get
hypnotized after all that's over to try to

42
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:31,270
maybe calm down that part of your
mind? Um, I never did. I had to do the,

43
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,610
I think helped me out the total.
Yeah, it is definitely that stuff.

44
00:02:34,611 --> 00:02:38,570
We helped me out. Did we'd help you
out at all? I'm pretty much, yeah.

45
00:02:38,571 --> 00:02:41,450
You know what I mean? But it had to do it
every day. I had to do it all the time.

46
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,430
Right.
Do it all the time then yeah,

47
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,160
if I went to another country and I didn't
have my weed up at insane, they what?

48
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,970
No, we I going to be here a
couple of days a week. A month,

49
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,950
get the hell out of here.
