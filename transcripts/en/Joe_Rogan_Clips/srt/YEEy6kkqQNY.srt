1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,170
For, uh, you know,

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:07,100
fast rising stars that are a rising
because of their beastliness in there,

3
00:00:07,101 --> 00:00:11,200
knock out power. It's not uncommon
for them to not train Jujitsu. Right.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,160
We've seen plenty of them,
you know what I mean?

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,170
How crazy would it be if Zingano
actually trained Jujitsu? Right.

6
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:21,120
And fell knowing at the time for that.
You know what I mean?

7
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:25,340
We don't know what he does.
Right. We don't know if he, they,

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,980
she just hit, you know what I mean? It's
probably not going to have a center,

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,340
but how loud,
if he didn't say he just,

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,780
he just went to Danaher's and just
fell in love with John Danaher.

11
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:40,620
They just became best friends now would
be any jumped in. Imagine how good,

12
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,520
you know what I mean?
With Jujitsu, he's like,

13
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:48,030
how old is you could only survive
with knock out power for so long.

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,530
You know what I mean? After a while
you're going to be getting clips easily.

15
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,270
Tail Hook guys were killing this show,
but talking over each other like this.

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,100
Yeah. You're, you're 100% right. You know
what I'm saying? Is eventually no matter,

17
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,630
no.
We see it over and over again.

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,310
No matter how Beasley you are and how
powerful you are with those punches,

19
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,400
eventually you're going to get clipped,
right? You're going to go down.

20
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,110
So eventually you might have to switch
your strategy to instead of going out

21
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:15,990
there and just trying to knock a dude out
to going out there and try and take it

22
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:20,130
to town and submit this month,
here we go. Well, he's so powerful.

23
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,350
If he had good wrestling
skills, holy shit, you're
gonna find out. Right? Exactly.

24
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:26,970
Says this is what if that has a
thing he's like with wrestlers,

25
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:29,670
don't you think that you have to
learn it at a really young age? Well,

26
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:32,940
George Saint Pierre didn't, right? Oh,

27
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,790
good head.
Damn.

28
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,820
Damn. Look how giant he lives.
So shit dude, he's so big.

29
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,520
So big. It's so dangerous. Shit.

30
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,270
Oh my goodness.
Oh my goodness.

31
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,930
Come on man.
He's incredible.

32
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:06,330
Did he blew his ACL, MCL, LCL. Something's
wrong with his leg or maybe not.

33
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,340
Dude and cane is one of the best of
all time. That's how good in Ghana was.

34
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,630
Damn. He got through that block. Fuck.

35
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,100
He got through it and
this

36
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,890
guy I've ever seen,

37
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,420
and it wouldn't have been a surprise
if in Ghana was super cautious,

38
00:02:27,421 --> 00:02:30,660
maybe two rounds of being super cautious.
We wouldn't be that surprise. Right?

39
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,210
Chill out Bro. But the fact
that he fucking threw down
like this, boom, he went,

40
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:40,870
oh
you almost like forearm.

41
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,290
You got forearmed in the first.
The first

42
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,370
she was his name. It, no, let's see.

43
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:55,080
This again.
Never got hit anywhere.

44
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,720
Oh Jesus.
Oh shall we say.

45
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,560
Oh Wow.
Everybody missed it.

46
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,860
We all missed it for Kina.

47
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,010
Let's be real damn

48
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:18,010
back injury. And I said this,
that Lcl, MCL, blow MCL.

49
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:20,920
Right then when it's bent this way,
when it comes to, that's all of them.

50
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,750
That's MCL. How old is he now? I don't
know. But he's a weathered whatever he is.

51
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,530
Shit turns 37

52
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,820
I wouldn't even fight.

53
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,490
And you could only take so many wars.

54
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,010
Each war is significant in your life.

55
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:44,011
Like each one took some of your
life and eventually that's it.

56
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:48,450
You can't, you already, you went to
five crazy wars. That's not that.

57
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,310
That's what Tom or that ended that
way. Well, you know what it is, man.

58
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:54,490
I think guys that are that
championship caliber like cane,

59
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,840
their mind is so ferocious that
their body is almost like a spaceship

60
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,250
reentering. It's missing tiles and
it starts fuck a chicken apart.

61
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:06,850
They're so powerful in terms of
their ability to teach driving.

62
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,090
They just keep driving and then
the knees go in, the neck goes in,

63
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:13,810
the back goes and then you deal with
these physical realities of the body that

64
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:14,900
you're giving.
It's still there.

65
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,230
I know the middle of that.

66
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:24,040
I'm in the middle of trying to come back.
You know what I mean?

67
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,230
Right now since my shoulder,

68
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,340
it's been six months since my shoulder
surgery had my bicep reattached to my

69
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:33,100
shoulder,
had knee surgery about 10 months ago.

70
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,610
That's still not 100% like it's still,
they're not red.

71
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:40,570
They're still 20 when they good Roland
with I'm rolling with the hunting 30

72
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,480
pound blue belts and shit
that he read write about shit.

73
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:47,020
The last three weeks I've been rolling
with some little blue belts that I got to

74
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:51,610
be able to have like 50 pounds on
him and have total control. You know,

75
00:04:51,611 --> 00:04:52,870
like at this point,
you know what I mean?

76
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:56,770
I'm still a little weird for franchisors
are blown ACL for Kate. Well,

77
00:04:56,771 --> 00:05:00,910
I mean it definitely is a blown knee for
cane, but Francis, when's your fight?

78
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:04,030
Because like when Francis was
coming after him and he clipped him,

79
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:06,570
he definitely clipped him with
that forearm behind the neck date,

80
00:05:06,571 --> 00:05:09,470
eat or Honda persist. That's a
nightmare. That's 100% for him.

81
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,780
That's a nightmare outcome.

82
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,660
100% cause Francis as little case
I just clipped and knocked down.

83
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,120
Do you want to hear that? They say,
yeah. What did they have to say? Yeah,

84
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,300
give me some volume,
but I look at the tits on him.

85
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:28,090
I don't hear anything. Good
job, Jamie. There it goes.

86
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,903
Okay.

87
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,550
I mean he believes it now.

88
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:05,580
He did, but I liked it the way
he was moving in on them, man.

89
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:06,940
I mean he really did look,

90
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,673
talk us through it again

91
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,360
on that Land Rover. At that forum did
the forum later in the back of his neck,

92
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,530
maybe your hands was shit,
blah, blah. You know what, man?

93
00:06:17,531 --> 00:06:20,350
I'm going to rethink what I said.
I'm going to rethink it. I know.

94
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:25,120
You see I stopped. I thought I
saw his forearm clip. His neck.

95
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,310
That's not where he blows it.
Wait, no, no, no, no trouble.

96
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,060
What do you think you did
hit him with that? No,

97
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:35,240
he kind of fell though before that.
No, Jane goes, that's what it is.

98
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,910
Yes.
I'll just and shit.

99
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:43,300
The thing is he's so heavy handed.
I think you might be correct,

100
00:06:43,301 --> 00:06:48,040
but I do think that he connected with
his neck or the guys this heavy handed.

101
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,290
Hold on a second. That no damage on his
shoulder. That was nothing. Nothing,

102
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,200
nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Yep.
Nigos that because you're right.

103
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,330
You're right. You're right. I
was wrong. I thought it was,

104
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,130
I thought it hit his neck. It did
not hit his neck. It hit his back.

105
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:07,180
Right shoulder.
Right elbow was clear.

106
00:07:07,181 --> 00:07:12,130
There is the total up. Here we go.
Holy Shit Dude. He was throwing around.

107
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,650
He's a freak for it to saint ghetto.

108
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,580
You're right.

109
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,090
That's a defensive line right there.

110
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:23,400
Okay.

111
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,000
A middle linebacker,
right? Well, he's not done.

112
00:07:27,001 --> 00:07:30,350
See the thing about this guys, he, he
hasn't been finding for very long though.

113
00:07:30,351 --> 00:07:34,510
Even though he loses to steep. Bain
has that, that timid and scared Lewis.

114
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,200
He says so little mileage. What
does it say about his name? Hold on.

115
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:47,320
That's how it happened. I know it
wasn't the result you're looking for.

116
00:07:47,321 --> 00:07:52,160
It will take some time, but how soon
might we see you back in, you know,

117
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,310
they're more calm and relaxed.
Ready to go.

118
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,010
This why this war. So breaking.
Everyone was going to happen

119
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:08,160
or it's the worst. Very classy.
Yeah. Came very classy. You know,

120
00:08:08,161 --> 00:08:12,900
never bitter.
How weird is it?

121
00:08:12,901 --> 00:08:14,760
The Fox and this one,

122
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,280
he's not even talking about his knee
thing is in retire. Things here. Retire.

123
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,390
No need to apologize. I know I speak
for you upstate fans around the world,

124
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:30,450
by the way. How good. How good is Jon
Anik? He's a bass. That's the best.

125
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:34,780
It's such a bummer to lose that wonderful
that Jon Anik is so good. I love John.

126
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,130
I'm so impressed with him. Like when
I worked with him, he's the best.

127
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,960
He's so like, he's such a
good commentator. Here's
a little thing right here.

128
00:08:42,961 --> 00:08:45,220
The first thing I'm going
to make sure it ESPN MMA,

129
00:08:45,221 --> 00:08:48,790
like let's look at this was
the shoulders was the, was

130
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:54,180
maybe an uppercut uppercut might've
landed right there. Ooh, my right there.

131
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,250
Right there. Right away. Upper
cut might've sat them down.

132
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:01,050
The opera cut mine high
iron cheese. God, here we go

133
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,340
again. Here we gotta go. So nothing

134
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,970
driving so far. Not Right. No, no.

135
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,960
You sell.
Can I redeem myself?

136
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:26,450
Okay, let's see. You are different anger.

137
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,550
I'm like cheese. Ice missed
it. That was a legit,

138
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,570
it's a legit,
when I was getting too close,

139
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,560
he blew his knee out for sure
because the uppercut watching

140
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,373
Sandown

141
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,670
cause is what's important.

142
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:53,430
Matt Taibbi has a fantastic article out
right now about one of the problems with

143
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:57,570
society today is that people look at
the news like they look at sports.

144
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,110
Like someone asks me write about things.
You have to know everything.

145
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,260
But it's a great article.
Matt Taibbi.

146
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,420
This is a perfect example of four guys
who are lifelong martial artists and we

147
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:13,300
both went both ways. I was like, you're
right, and then we saw it again and like,

148
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,680
you're right. That's how you're
supposed to look at Shit. Yeah.

149
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,650
That's how you supposed to let them lines.
It

150
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:27,030
can't be attached. Certain fights
he gets stopped early. Okay.

151
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,680
Tj Answer Huda.
I thought it was stopped early due.

152
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,580
I've talked to people that say they
didn't think it was stopped early and I'm

153
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:36,870
like, all right, hey, I'll listen
to me. Listen, he clipped him,

154
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,830
but I felt like when I watch it that
you got to give a guy a chance to fight

155
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:44,700
more, but especially on that,
hey, you out in the NFL,

156
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,320
when they review plays,

157
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,330
they review them and one of the most
important things about reviewing a play is

158
00:10:51,331 --> 00:10:54,180
that you have multiple
angles. Yeah, it's all

159
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,940
three angles. They keep going back
to the first angle we didn't get,

160
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,330
we didn't get a good enough angle
because that right hand was like a ghost

161
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:08,220
writing. I didn't see it. You guys
saw it. I didn't see it so exciting.

162
00:11:08,221 --> 00:11:11,670
With shit like that is going on and
the UFC truck is the best in the world.

163
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,190
Like mark tell the grotto and
all those dudes back there,

164
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,690
Anthony Giordano and the whole crew,
they're always moving. Mark Delicate.

165
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,640
Rodney Rodney motherfucker.
He works,

166
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,840
he figures out what the replay shine
love him. He's like, I didn't know that.

167
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,370
I didn't know that. I fucking
love that dude. He's the
shit. So He's, he does like,

168
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,680
he'll like pick the play by play angles.

169
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:38,820
He'll pick lecture and cause he talks
about fights because he knows. Yeah,

170
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,620
Todd Feldman made bank off a fucking
Francis by the way. He did big bank. Damn.

171
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:48,080
I'm telling you dude, if that guy keeps
learning and it seems like he got out,

172
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:49,230
he had a weird spot.

173
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:53,210
But you know what I really like about
that weird spot that he got into? Yep.

174
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,410
He was honest about it. He said, I
carried over fear from my last fight. Oh,

175
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:02,440
a guy who can look at himself that
honestly plus his ego got out of control

176
00:12:02,441 --> 00:12:05,240
cause he's not going to dude's
out and then that's a good thing.

177
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,840
He know. He said that an interview
like even as his ego, just coaches,

178
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:12,640
like he just thought he was
bigger than the game. Right.

179
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:17,230
But the on how bold and now he fucking
just knocked out Cain Velasquez before

180
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:21,970
that. He murked fucking homeboy.
I mean Chris Blades, hi.

181
00:12:21,971 --> 00:12:23,440
Can't remember the name.
He looked,

182
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,900
he looked like he was in a
different weight category.

183
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,070
He's the, based on your
strength, you know,

184
00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:34,630
it is like the future is an
athlete that really at 265 pounds,

185
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,030
it doesn't have to gain any weight.
It doesn't have to lose anyway.

186
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,110
Oh they're going to show it to us again.

187
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,970
The the future is and can we talk
who hasn't deterred debut a Fox.

188
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,900
Cain gets knocked up by G
jds. Jesus Christ, ESPN.

189
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:51,890
He gets knocked up by Francis and he
took that jab right there to Frances

190
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:56,890
Frances Clifton with a hard job to
be to understand what you're saying.

191
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:01,040
Okay. That's a legit point.
I just wanted to be like, oh,

192
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:06,530
100% some quick fast and I want to
say that again. I want to do that.

193
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,750
How fast he is. Back up just a wee
bit. Yes. Just out of the play.

194
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:14,070
This over and over. Let's look. Let's
look at this. The exchange kitchen.

195
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,820
We're sweet C he hits him.
Nothing fucking right hand,

196
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,960
right upper cut shovel.
It's a shocking struggle.

197
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:26,190
Can we get slow mo is that he hits him
with a rock and then you need the shush

198
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:30,970
of the faith instead of,
he said, try one more time.

199
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,590
I think his knees. Okay. Right
now. Not Hell's now. Ooh,

200
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,240
wait a minute. That's why I came to him
and he goes, I came in to close too soon.

201
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:45,480
He's so powerful. Watch this.
Watch that Shit Jamie. Just play,

202
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,580
play, pause, play, pause,
play, pause, play punks,

203
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:53,140
directv guy like it's a VCR
in the nineties this angle,

204
00:13:53,141 --> 00:13:56,980
it looks like we're trying to get a tick
in the nineties for sure in Ghana is a

205
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:00,550
good angle for in Ghana right here.
Oh right.

206
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:06,760
Watch this watch has head move. Ooh. And
then he got clipped and that's what I,

207
00:14:06,761 --> 00:14:11,200
that's why came. Did it address that? And
he goes, I got too close too. So he's too,

208
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,211
when you,

209
00:14:12,211 --> 00:14:16,600
when you think about a person that might
be like 41 pounds on the cocaine party

210
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,690
where you're saying you think about
a person like he, you know, he's,

211
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,010
he's essentially like optimize
their to 65 or he's optimized.

212
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:28,480
He's like a of real through 65
CC's for five rounds of July,

213
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:31,460
z optimized. Well here's
the thing though, he,

214
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,680
all he has to do is get better at that
first round and do you really think a lot

215
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:37,300
of guys are going to make it
into their second or third?

216
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,320
They've just played it in slow
motion. Oh fuck. I missed this angle.

217
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:44,700
It looks like you missed this and I
don't really know. He shovel who know us.

218
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:49,070
Can we hold on, hold on. Hold on.
Slow motion. I clipped him there.

219
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,640
Right kind. Hundred percent. That's clips.

220
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:56,120
That's 100% says that
you see his head move.

221
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,720
That's why king throws a single leg
on the ref cause he's concussed.

222
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,310
He went for the single friends. This
is the scariest of all time. Guys win.

223
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:07,270
Oh fall time over ubering dude.
The thing about Francis,

224
00:15:07,271 --> 00:15:09,310
his speed,
he's he,

225
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,470
he's learning at this
like really rapid rate.

226
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:15,200
When you look at a guy that's only
been doing it for how many years now?

227
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,480
100% trained. He's been fighting
for like maybe five years,

228
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,720
I think five years from the
time he learns martial arts.

229
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,370
His Dad was some legendary fights.
He was doing this with saying, dude,

230
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,510
he's a movie character. If he can
just get over the hump that he got,

231
00:15:32,511 --> 00:15:35,690
look the steep, pay me. Oh, chicks fight.
That's, that's what's up man. I mean,

232
00:15:35,691 --> 00:15:40,000
he got to the top of the mount
dude. He's a funny guy. DC now.

233
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:40,970
Revenger boy.
