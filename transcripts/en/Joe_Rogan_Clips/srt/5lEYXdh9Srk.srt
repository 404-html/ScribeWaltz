1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,490
The joe rogan experience.
Yeah. Thanks the belt on.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,670
How are you fuckers doing great man.
It's great to be on the show again.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,070
Great to have you guys here. Um, you know,

4
00:00:11,071 --> 00:00:14,190
I was watching your Instagram the other
day and I was looking at you with fake

5
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:18,330
hips doing crazy fucking heavy
dead lifts. Man, that's amazing.

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,650
I am starting to dead lift a little
bit more because I've been doing this

7
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:26,880
carnivore diet and I feel great and
there's no reason not to, right? So, um,

8
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:32,010
I just figured if I can do it and it
doesn't hurt, Diana, why not? So, uh,

9
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,400
I was going up til about 400 pounds,
but I think I can still,

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,050
I think I can even get stronger now.

11
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:41,810
So what I am so happy about is this is
something squatting and deadlifting.

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,250
It's something that was part
of my life all growing up.

13
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:47,160
I was a power lifter all growing up and
he's the one that got me into this shit

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,120
and it, it got taken away from me and
I was really sad and disappointed.

15
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:54,630
Became a drug addict and an alcoholic
because of it. And now I can lift again.

16
00:00:54,631 --> 00:00:58,380
So I feel good that is that unusual for
someone who's got artificial hips to be

17
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:01,350
able to do something like
that? Um, do you know,

18
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:03,720
do how many people don't know
that have artificial hips? Well,

19
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:06,930
I do know that Ed Cohen, who's the
greatest power lifter of all time,

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,050
he has two fake hips now,
right? Yeah, I think so.

21
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,230
I think he's still squat 600 gs.

22
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,920
Eddie Cohen, check him out. He's a
beast. Fake hips squatting 600 pounds.

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,170
They sees days like one of
the most effective replacement
surgeries that they do

24
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,020
is replacing apples.
I think it's a great and a big deal.

25
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,930
I think it's a great surgery.
Before I got it done, I mean,

26
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:34,110
I couldn't even get up out of a chair.
I was, I'd be stuck, you know, I would,

27
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:39,000
I would stick places and um, before I got
it done, I couldn't really move at all.

28
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,210
And then after I got it done,
they had botched one side.

29
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,310
So one side went perfect.

30
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,060
The other side for two years was all
screwed up and the doctors didn't know it.

31
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,360
What was screwed up about
it. Um, the, the cup,

32
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,850
there's a cup and then there's
the ball that goes into the cup.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,270
The Cup came loose and it would,
it would shift around.

34
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,930
Now they think the cup comes loose
because when you do both hips at the same

35
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:01,590
time,

36
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,400
they hammer one hip and the one side and
then you're completely like a dead body

37
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:08,250
almost. And they flip you over.
It's really an island actually.

38
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,810
When they flip you over,
they think that's when the hit might,

39
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,770
that socket may come out.
So, um, they're starting to,

40
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,540
to question doing them both
on the same day. Now, yeah,

41
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:20,090
I've heard of people getting one done.

42
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,400
Then a couple months later
I would recommend getting
one done because then when

43
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:24,680
I got my other one,

44
00:02:24,681 --> 00:02:28,950
when I got the one that was messed up
redone and I had one good leg and one know

45
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,680
one leg to recover on,
it was so much easier.

46
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:34,180
I didn't have to have the special toilet
and how the other students are going to

47
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:36,240
be on crutches instead of being
in a wheelchair probably right.

48
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,000
If you only had one bag.
So I actually wasn't even on crutches.

49
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:42,840
I came home from the hospital and that
day that I came home from the hospital I

50
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:43,800
was,
I was walking,

51
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:47,670
I even climbed a ladder and our mom
yelled at us and yelled at me because I

52
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:50,820
climbed a ladder and she's like, what
are you doing? He just got a hip surgery.

53
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,290
I got to change this light bulb.

54
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,150
I would think that one good benefit
about weightlifting would be increase in

55
00:02:57,151 --> 00:03:02,151
bone density as you want that to have
artificial hips especially cause you got

56
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:06,970
that bar that goes down deep into the
bone and the hip got a Dexa scan done.

57
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,730
Weird shit going on.
We've got really weird shit going on.

58
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:14,560
We had a Dexa scan done and Dr.
Jacob Wilson told us that our bone,

59
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,970
was it bone mineral density.
Density density. Yeah, it was mine.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,700
Mine was like off the charts,
but his was way off the charts.

61
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,580
We also got a biopsy done by Dr
Andy Galpin and he's just like,

62
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:30,160
dude, he's like, I don't the
fuck's going on with your,

63
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,490
with my muscle and his muscle. He's like,
but we need to talk about this morning.

64
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:36,700
So it's called steroids. I know. Yeah.

65
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,420
So he said he wanted to interview me more
in and talk to me more about like what

66
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:42,610
I've taken over the years ago.
It was different. Things works.

67
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,540
It works fantastic when people do it.
I just think,

68
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,600
I heard you talking the other day about
throwing a roundhouse kick and he said

69
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:53,410
it's a second nature to you. And I think
for us, we've been lifting for so long,

70
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,460
a lot of this stuff,

71
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,930
even when I was a drug addict and
alcoholic the entire time I still try and

72
00:03:57,931 --> 00:04:00,220
every day I wasn't doing as good of a job,

73
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:02,830
but I still would make it to the
gym everyday. It's ingrained in us.

74
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,540
It's something that
we've been doing forever.

75
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:08,180
So I think that is just designed for it.
It's essentially designed for,

76
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,270
not designed,
but you've sort of designed it.

77
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,090
And I think it's something
that found us, you know, like,

78
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,950
like we did kind of stumble upon it.

79
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:18,040
But I think it's something that
found us and it's uh, you know,

80
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,970
I was strong right out of the gate. He
was strong right out of the gate. I mean,

81
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,930
I remember, uh, my friend's bench in the
garage and they were benching the bar,

82
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,490
maybe a 10 on each side and I was,
you know, doing a plate, doing one 85,

83
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:32,960
12 years old, you know, he was
an animal when he was young.

84
00:04:32,961 --> 00:04:35,200
It was just something there, there
was some sort of strength. My mom,

85
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,030
our mom benched, uh,
what she meant 35. Yeah,

86
00:04:38,031 --> 00:04:41,200
she's been mom can bench one
35 like right off, you know,

87
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:44,590
like without ever lifting. I want
to say, I think she benched one 85.

88
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,670
She might've been the same day cause Joey
ideas would say immigrant mentality as

89
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:52,900
a mother from where's she from?
She's a Polish right. You Go,

90
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,780
I just got something in my heart
thought I'm just, I'm just white

91
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:03,520
mix 23 and me done. I got one of
those things done and I, yeah,

92
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:07,360
I'm like Irish and a tea. I'm like only
4% Italian. I thought we were more,

93
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,260
but it makes no sense. Our grandmother
was directly from Sicily, so I don't,

94
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,440
I don't understand how that happened.
Yeah. We don't know what's going on. Yeah.

95
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:16,900
Well, even if she's
from Sicily, who knows?

96
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:19,930
Like how it happened and she was
over there where she came from.
