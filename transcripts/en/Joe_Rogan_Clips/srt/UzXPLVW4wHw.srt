1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,920
When you look at the DMT experience and
you look at its effect on the human mind,

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,860
how much have you subscribes to?

3
00:00:07,861 --> 00:00:10,830
The idea that we're looking at is
some sort of a chemical gateway,

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,160
chemical gateway to what whatever it is
to whatever that DMT experiences that

5
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:22,240
this is something that your brain has
the ability to travel to. But I mean,

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,720
since we know that the body does
produce this and when we know that it's

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,170
possible for people to,
I mean I've never done it,

8
00:00:33,171 --> 00:00:38,171
but I know that people who do Kundalini
Yoga have apparently reported trip,

9
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:43,170
like experiences that are very similar
to a real DMT flash or the mind has this

10
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:46,440
ability to do this on its own.
What do you think that that,

11
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,990
is that something worth
considering that this is,

12
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,230
this is some sort of a pathway to a
nearby dimension or to something that's

13
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:55,230
around us all the time,

14
00:00:55,231 --> 00:00:58,500
but we just don't have access
to with normal neurochemistry

15
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,050
he had it all. There are too many what
ifs or who know. I mean there's, you know,

16
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,110
there's so much in what you've
said where you have to go back and,

17
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,670
and unpack all of these things.

18
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,600
When we got excited about DMT,

19
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:18,390
Terence and me and the
early in the late sixties,

20
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:23,391
what led us to go to La Chorrera was that
it seemed like a completely different

21
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:28,740
order of magnitude than any
of the other psychedelics.

22
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,990
And we came to it really from a childhood
that was steeped in science fiction.

23
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:36,750
So we carried with a theater with us.
The idea,

24
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,080
this really is another dimension and it
may be a portal to another dimension.

25
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,010
And as science fiction nuts,
we were totally okay with that.

26
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,540
And we thought baby DMT
was, and maybe it is, but,

27
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,800
or it's,
it,

28
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,810
it somehow pulls the curtain back on
something that's around us all the time

29
00:01:59,751 --> 00:02:04,640
that we don't see. Um, but again,
in thinking about these things,

30
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,710
is it something that is entirely within
the brain that it originates or is it

31
00:02:09,711 --> 00:02:14,450
something that,
is it like a lens that you know,

32
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:17,390
or our eyes are covered with, with, uh,

33
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,930
with filters and DMT temporarily
removes those filters?

34
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,460
I think it's hard to know. I mean, I
think maybe experimentally we could,

35
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:29,880
we could begin to approach
this. Have you, you know, and I,

36
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:34,740
I think we really know. I think that's
another thing about natural philosophy.

37
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:36,780
Um,

38
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,780
that's important that science is
overlooking and natural philosophy always

39
00:02:42,481 --> 00:02:46,350
remembers the limits of what is known.
You know,

40
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:50,850
and science is a bit arrogant about
what they think is known. You know,

41
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:56,090
they only in science only understands a
small fraction of all there is to know.

42
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,630
And I was another psychedelic
always remind me of this,
you know, when I take it,

43
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,900
remember the limitations of your knowledge
or sometimes more or less kindly says

44
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:12,070
it, right? You don't know shit.
And it's true. We don't know shit.

45
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,830
You know, and sciences
can forget that, you know,

46
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:20,060
but as far as this DMT a thing,
you know,

47
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,520
this is actually a, there's
controversy about this because, uh,

48
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,580
you know, um, a lot of it,

49
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,350
a lot of people who have
worked in this area say it's,

50
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:36,910
it's pretty well established that
endogenous DMT can produce these states,

51
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:41,911
that the pineal can secrete DMT under
certain circumstances or under stress.

52
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:49,111
The lungs can produce large amounts of
DMT that are translocated to the brain.

53
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:54,970
Um, but it's, it's not so clear
that that goes on. I mean,

54
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:59,410
it's clear that it can be produced.
But David Nichols, you know,

55
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,470
who knows a thing or two
about pharmacology, it,

56
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:06,780
founder of the Heffter institute worlds,
you know,

57
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,010
most,
uh,

58
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,680
authoritative highest authority when it
comes to the chemistry and pharmacology

59
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:17,110
of, of psychedelics. He's the redeemer.

60
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:22,140
He's taken a reductionist argument
on this that's Kinda hard to,

61
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:24,460
uh,
to knock down,

62
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:28,510
which is that DMT is
produced in dodgy honestly,

63
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,780
but it's chopped up so quickly that
it never reaches the site of action.

64
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:38,971
And it never reaches the levels at the
neuron that it would take to activate the

65
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,300
neuron. Um, you know,

66
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:48,330
so want to consume or are you saying
endogenously produced the MTN endogenously

67
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,220
so that it, it does, when you consume it,

68
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:56,020
obviously you flood the system and you'll
get much higher levels than has ever

69
00:04:56,021 --> 00:04:58,900
produced indogenous Lee and I,

70
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,920
but we haven't really measured the
levels produced in dodgy honestly,

71
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,470
during especially these extreme states.
And that's part of the problem.

72
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:09,340
That's part of the problem. How do you do
that? Have you done, how do you do that?

73
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,410
What have you done Kundalini and tried
to recreate? No, I haven't either.

74
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:18,810
I've been, you know, Terence had that
fantastic joke. Uh, it was, uh, uh,

75
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:23,230
talk about, uh, that this
monk had PR practice,

76
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:26,210
the city of levitation. Do
you remember this one? And uh,

77
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:30,290
that the Buddha came to town and he said
for the last 20 years I practiced the

78
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:34,300
city of levitation. I can now walk on
water. And the Buddhist said, yeah,

79
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,920
but the ferries only a nickel.

80
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,530
It's like, do you want to practice
Kundalini for 10 years? And,

81
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,760
and Bang your head towards the East
or just smoked DMT 30 seconds later.

82
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,780
Right in the center of the universe.

83
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,200
But I think the last time I was on
your show, we talked about this, uh,

84
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:57,150
this other thing, this Algina
light we discussed. Yes.

85
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,800
And I don't know if you've interviewed.
Yeah, we have to buy you one.

86
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,610
I said we were, we've totally dropped the
ball on that. You don't have to buy. No,

87
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:07,120
we do have to buy. You want
water by herself. What?

88
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,470
I'm going to buy myself one venue
and this time we're going to do it.

89
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,680
We said we're good. I do too many
podcasts. I forget everything. I know. I,

90
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:18,770
I've never bought the agile alliance
is interesting because you know,

91
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,680
I mean he claims and that was the
conversation we had. He claims yes,

92
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:28,610
this stimulates in dacha synthesis
of writing this down right now. Put,

93
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,020
spell it out for me. A Jay and the AE, uh,

94
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,300
ODG,
no light.

95
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,500
And his website is [inaudible] dot com

96
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:46,100
and there's some good PDFs on there
that'll explain what this is about on that

97
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:46,934
Jamie.
Yeah.

98
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,930
And now it's quite a big time cause
I just mentioned this guy show.

99
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,360
Right. But anyway, he,

100
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,030
this light can produce some
sort of a side note experience.

101
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:02,660
He claims it stimulates DMT
synthesis in the pineal.

102
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,710
When you lie underneath that,
it's just a bunch of, it's,

103
00:07:06,711 --> 00:07:08,630
it looks like a floor lamp,
you know,

104
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:13,430
with a rectangular mount
bunch of LEDs underneath it,

105
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:18,260
which he programs with an
iPad and different patterns.
You lie under it and you,

106
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:23,250
it stimulates hypnagogic hallucinations
looking at them that are a lot like uh,

107
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,800
that guy looks like an old school
freak. Look at him. He's a zen monk.

108
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,850
I bet he is. Amongst other things.
He used to be an apple engineer.

109
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:36,770
He was real jobs right hand man
when whilst he went the right way,

110
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,200
he went the right way.
So he's got this thing.

111
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:43,100
Is that cord going down to her head
and a hard time seeing what's happening

112
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,040
cause something's wrapped around her head.
That better not be a crystal.

113
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,910
I think that run out of this room.
No, I think it's a deceptive thing.

114
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:54,310
He didn't attach anything to meet
prospective issue court going, okay.

115
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,590
I said,
so you lie under this thing.

116
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,010
And first time I lied under it, I
thought I got all these colors. I go,

117
00:08:02,011 --> 00:08:06,650
all these hypnagogic affects, you
know, and nice patterns and all that.

118
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:11,570
Like a sub threshold DMT
experience. And I said, well,

119
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:16,190
you know, the uh, the LEDs
are all changing color, right?

120
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,850
And that's how I see it. He
says, no, they're white. The
colors are coming from you.

121
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,390
You're so fine. The colors. So, okay,

122
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,290
so it was interesting.
And then we got into the conversation.

123
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:31,880
How do you know this is stimulating DMT?
How do you know that's the effect?

124
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:35,990
Turns out it's not so
easy to nail that down.

125
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,320
You know, because the empty is saw a
femoral in the system. You can't, uh,

126
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:46,310
take urine samples or cerebral
spinal fluid or anything.

127
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,170
It would be gone by the time
you, you did it. So the only way,

128
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,240
well maybe not the only way,

129
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:58,080
but one way you could do it is you
could do something called a, um,

130
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:02,520
it's essentially you couldn't do
this to a human because you couldn't,

131
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,190
you couldn't get an FDA approval for it,

132
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:10,191
but you could put a micro capillary
tube right next to the pineal that will

133
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:13,980
absorb things as they are released.

134
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,650
And then you could recover that and say,
you know,

135
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:20,400
levels of DMT or why couldn't you
do that to a voluntary participant?

136
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:26,010
Voluntary or not? You'd be
screwing their brain up. Well, no,

137
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:29,820
not necessarily, but you'd have a hard
time getting permission. There might be,

138
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,960
you could do it to a rat though.
You could do it to her. Well,

139
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,480
that's what cottonwood
research foundation's done,
right? They've done that.

140
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,850
That's how they discovered
DMT in the pineal, um, yeah,

141
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,660
to a live rat. Yeah. Yeah. That's how they
discovered it. That was the first proof.

142
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,250
Right? That was the first
proof. Nick Cozy, um,

143
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,000
who's a pharmacologist at the
University of Wisconsin at Madison.

144
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:58,730
He was really the first one
to show that DMT is a, uh,

145
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,390
you know,
endogenously produced.

146
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,430
Now that's a sigma one agonist as well
as a Serotonin agonist, which is another,

147
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:10,770
another receptor. Um, you know,
lap. That's definitely that.

148
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,310
But it's not clear what the function is.
It's,

149
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:20,010
it's a complicated issue, you
know. Um, to figure this out,

150
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:24,540
I'll send you a paper that Nicole's
rotor elite l linked to a video where he

151
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,940
discusses this and it's like,
you know,

152
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:32,090
he gave that at the breaking convention
conference last summer that I was at and

153
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,381
it was like,
you know,

154
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:39,381
he was like the Big Downer
of the conference stride
because everybody has this

155
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,490
romantic idea and he comes along
and just squashes it, you know,

156
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,940
and it's like, man, here, you know,
you have disappointed a lot of people,

157
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:53,610
but on the other hand, reality is
good. You know, facts are good.

158
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:58,410
What guy did do that?
Uh,

159
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,290
that sort of made me think,

160
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:06,120
made me think maybe there is
something to it. He's tried, um,

161
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,750
pre dosing with an Mao inhibitor.
Just,

162
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:12,800
just take banisteriopsis tea without them.

163
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:17,330
The admixture about 30 minutes before
going under the light, and then the,

164
00:11:17,331 --> 00:11:21,030
it's much more intense and it's much
more prolonged. You've done this.

165
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:25,560
I haven't done it. Um, but he claims
that on other people say that it,

166
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,190
it definitely enhances the,

167
00:11:27,191 --> 00:11:32,191
so that would indicate that the
breakdown of DMT has been inhibited.

168
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:38,450
Is he claiming that you could reach
actual DNT states with this device upon

169
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,530
practice?
Yeah.
