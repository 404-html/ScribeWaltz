1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,410
Things was like,
I,

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,760
I had tried to encourage Phil Hartman
to do stand up several times because he

3
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:08,980
would do standup where he would
warm up for the, you know, the,

4
00:00:08,981 --> 00:00:12,510
the crowd would be there for the show.
And in between scenes,

5
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:17,130
there was always some downtime and Phil
would take the warmups microphone and do

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,890
bitch riff. And I do like,
is Bill Clinton impression?

7
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:21,930
This was during the whole
Monica Lewinsky scandal.

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,490
So he had like all this material
about Bill Clinton and Monica and his

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,100
impressions were amazing.
Yeah. Yeah. No, he's like,

10
00:00:29,101 --> 00:00:32,820
he's one of my favorites of all time
on that show. Yeah. He was amazing.

11
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,800
And so he was thinking about
what is this two shows?

12
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,390
Where is he Huntsville,

13
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:44,070
Alabama still doing stand up look. And
then he didn't give a fuck. Look at,

14
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:48,390
I'm out there with those glasses
is great. Hey, looks happy.

15
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,120
He looks back at 14 likes.
Hey,

16
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:57,480
I'm Jon Lovitz get out the
likes looking on my legs.

17
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,470
Yeah. So he's still doing it. Interesting.
Yeah. Good for him. Good for him.

18
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,010
Like I said, I always liked
him. Great Guy. When I did SNL,

19
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,930
I think it was the first
season where he had,

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,960
he had just left I think because I did
it pretty much probably if I had to pick

21
00:01:12,241 --> 00:01:14,490
a season, I would been, that
would've been that when I did,

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,010
cause he still had Carvey
and you still had, you know,

23
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,360
Hartman and Victoria Jackson, like
the whole kind of group. But um,

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,150
I forgot him of Victoria Jackson.
She was fucking hilarious. Yeah.

25
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,590
What happened to her? She's a
hardcore conservative now. Yeah. Huge.

26
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:31,620
Like right wing, right winger. She's
put on a little weight, you know,

27
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:34,490
but I haven't wheel and uh, yeah, no,

28
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,620
she's actually a hardcore
conservative. No, like she,

29
00:01:37,621 --> 00:01:40,020
she shouted from the mountaintops,

30
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,060
what was she like when you met
her? She was fine. I mean, listen,

31
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,700
when she conservative back then I was
busy doing the show kind of thing,

32
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,040
you know what I mean? Cause it's a lot of
work. And in which war? No, he, that I,

33
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,100
I had to do,
um,

34
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,230
I had to do it without cue cards because
my father didn't want me to use cue

35
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:57,810
cards. So I don't like to
memorize all that stuff.

36
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,110
Plus Fuck Dad plus plus the skits.
That didn't even make it into the show.

37
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:03,610
So like I had to memorize like
schizo didn't even end up in the,

38
00:02:03,611 --> 00:02:07,530
this kind of Shit is that
dad, you know, I, like I said,

39
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:10,390
I had a good memory and he didn't
want me reading. You know, cause it,

40
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,290
you can see it,

41
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,340
they can see it when people are reading
and he didn't want me to do in that. So.

42
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,500
Wow.
So Nokia card,

43
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:19,710
but also that means the other actors
do cue card for them either. Yeah,

44
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:22,290
of course not. You know, like, yeah, no,

45
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,890
I'm sure my father made a lot
of friends looking at like,

46
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,770
you know that that weekend.
Well that's fucked up.

47
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:32,160
Like how can he dictate whether or
not the other actors get cue cards?

48
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,170
I don't know. Because it's
because he apparently he could.

49
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,400
Victoria Jackson's a
hardcore conservative. It's
so straight. Like I said,

50
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,230
she shouts it from the, from the
mountaintops looking again active. Yeah.

51
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,490
So she was like, you know, so
it was that whole kind of group,

52
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:51,230
that kind of late eighties group. Uh,
but then also it was a, it was my,

53
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,110
a second season, I think, you know, it
was, it was like, you know, Schneider,

54
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,160
Sandler Rock.
It was like that kind of overlap year.

55
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,400
So I actually got like a really kind
of like really good group that Leanne,

56
00:03:02,401 --> 00:03:04,230
I'm so, no, that was
awesome. That was neat.
