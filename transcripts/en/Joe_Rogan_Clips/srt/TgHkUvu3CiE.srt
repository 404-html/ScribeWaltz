1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,040
Spoken alliance. It's not a secret,
it's just, it's not there. It's there,

2
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:08,400
but it's not, nobody's talking
about it. Do you realize,

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,980
I'll just give an example.
Okay.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,270
If you needed more reasons to think
that Columbus was a dick. Okay.

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,520
Let me add one to it. When we
were kids and today, I know,

6
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,090
I know,

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,090
but actually I do have something smiley
redeeming to offer about Columbus if you

8
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:30,370
have the time. I just want to,
okay, let's start off with that.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,490
Do you want me start out with that?
How do you want to do it?

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,630
I'll do the dick part. Okay,
so on his third voyage,

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,570
he's in,
by the time of his third voyage,

12
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,590
he had already planted enough Spanish
flags that Spain had already begun to set

13
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:48,591
up governments and infrastructures in
these places that he had a compound

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,060
basically conquered and so,

15
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,320
so in one of the places was it,
it's in the book accurately,

16
00:00:58,321 --> 00:00:59,490
but I think it's Hispaniola.

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,330
One of the island today he has
to get back is it's third voice,

18
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:07,950
1503 1504 he's got to get back to Spain.
He doesn't have enough resources,

19
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,460
not enough food for his crew.
So he asks the natives,

20
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,060
would you please give us some of your
stock that you have collected from your

21
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:18,444
farming?

22
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,340
Now this particular group of natives only
makes exactly the amount of food they

23
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:28,020
need to tie to the next crop. They
don't have surplus. So they said, no,

24
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,730
we don't have surplus. Sorry.
Columbus knew that one week,

25
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:33,540
hence,

26
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,540
coincidentally there was gonna be a total
lunar eclipse with a moon in its orbit

27
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:40,980
around Earth,
enters earth's shadow.

28
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,490
The full moon enters earth's
shadow and disappears.

29
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,200
And that the geometry of that event,

30
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,150
it's just a simple lunar eclipse,

31
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,440
but the geometry says that sunlight
passes around earth through earth's

32
00:01:55,441 --> 00:02:00,441
atmosphere and takes on sunset colors
that Leech into Earth's shadow giving the

33
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,200
moon. If you can see it at
all, a deep red amber hue,

34
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,650
almost the color of blood Columbus set.

35
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:14,550
And he knew about this cause he had
read the tables, the eclipse tables.

36
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:19,320
All right? We, we'd known enough about
the solar system at the time too.

37
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,810
We got that. Okay. Actually back then,

38
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:25,350
it was just the known world with Earth
in the middle of the known universe.

39
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,870
But that didn't matter. The rhythms
of the universe, we're known.

40
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,530
He says to the natives,
if you do not give us food,

41
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,540
my God,

42
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:38,730
which is more powerful than your God
will make the moon disappear and it will

43
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:43,530
turn blood red. That will happen in
one week. You have one week to comply.

44
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,000
Some of them were skeptical of what
you can't. What other sets? Shit,

45
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,780
we got to do what this guy said. Look
at the ships. They came in, their guns,

46
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:55,200
their power, their, their
culture. Look what they've got.

47
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,100
Sure enough,
right on cue.

48
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,840
The moon begins to disappear according
to that. That is a famous woodcut.

49
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:09,040
Um Oh, you got this. Oh those
viewing the video of this.

50
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,050
That is a famous woodcut.

51
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,010
And notice the natives bowing to him
and he stands proudly cause he knows the

52
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:18,700
science. He knows the
astronomy. He knew this.

53
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,940
And so he invokes this to dominate
people who are not yet scientifically

54
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:27,790
literate.
And within seconds of this beginning,

55
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,980
they bring him all the resources
he wants. And he gets, and I don't,

56
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,500
we don't know what happened,
you know,

57
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:35,350
back at the island whether the
people survived the winter,

58
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,120
but he got back to the island,

59
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:42,380
that that is one microcosm of a set of
ways that the universe has been invoked

60
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,150
in this. I'll give you another example
of Los Alamos, one of the national labs.

61
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,930
They today as basically
since their inception,

62
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:55,290
are charged with tracking the
nuclear arsenal of the United States,

63
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,310
our nuclear power, the, the nukes
that would go into nuclear weapons.

64
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,460
They think about this.
Do you realize they hire astrophysicist?

65
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:07,600
I had colleagues work in there. You
know why? Because there's our room.

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,840
There are two rooms. I mean
I'm, I'm, I'm simplifying this,

67
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:14,890
but basically there are two rooms adjacent
to one another and a computer between

68
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:18,250
the two of them,
the most powerful computers in the world,

69
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,520
and there is code running
on those computers that
calculates the energy yields

70
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,560
of hydrogen fusion.

71
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,840
That's exactly what an astrophysicist
cares about when stars blow up.

72
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,980
Okay.

73
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,980
The Sun is undergoing nuclear fusion right
now and that's how it's making energy

74
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,830
and when the, when high mass stars
dies, they exploded supernova.

75
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,960
This is a natural thing going on.

76
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:47,260
Then you ever in the universe on the
other side, that's a classified room.

77
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:52,770
They're calculating yields of hydrogen
bombs and they have lunch together and

78
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:58,330
they compare notes. The government
doesn't always have the best people,

79
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,430
but if you hire some of the best people
to do whatever it is they want and

80
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:08,431
they'd calculations happen to relate to
a military project there you have a two

81
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:13,420
way street in progress. Why do you
think the Hubble telescope that the,

82
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,580
the,
the mirror issues not withstanding,

83
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,610
which were ultimately fixed
when it was first launched,

84
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,900
why was that so successful?

85
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,990
There were versions of the
Hubble telescope previously
launched by the military

86
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,840
looking down that,

87
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:33,070
that the model for that telescope had
already been conceived and built and was

88
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:36,970
operating. Then we say, oh, we want
one of those. Okay, but we don't,

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,140
that's not public that this is going on.
We designed, the telescope gets designed.

90
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,160
It has the benefit of previous versions
of it. Having been used successfully,

91
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,770
but looking down and we look up,

92
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:53,550
this is the perennial two way street of
astronomy in the old days and in modern

93
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:56,980
times,
astrophysics and the invention of the,

94
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,380
you haven't said anything yet or you
just, you look, you're a good listener.

95
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,100
I'll should I keep, just keep talking
and by preventing you from interrupting.

96
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:10,430
Don't worry about me. Okay, fine.
Galileo perfects the telescope.

97
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,770
He learned that it had just been
invented in the Netherlands.

98
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,460
The Dutch were were up opticians.
All right,

99
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:20,630
so they invented the telescope and the
microscope within a couple of years of

100
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:24,620
one another. This transformed science.
When did they invent the eyeglass?

101
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,620
The reading class, the reading
earlier than that, but I don't,

102
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,430
I don't know when the real advance was
putting two lenses in line with one

103
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:34,970
another. Sounds trivial in modern
times, but that was a huge leap.

104
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,630
Conceptual leap and what you
would accomplish and in so doing,

105
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,090
depending on how you curve them
and how you grind them, grind that,

106
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:47,260
the shape of those lenses you would
get a microscope or telescope and,

107
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,860
and we're off to the races.

108
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,360
That's basically the birth
of modern science as we now
think of it. And, and, and,

109
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,530
and conducted. Because you
say to yourself, my senses,

110
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,600
I don't trust them to be the full record
of what's going on in front of me.

111
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:06,890
You pull out a microscope. Oh my gosh.
Leeuwenhoek he got the microscope guy.

112
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,530
He thought he got a drop of pond water,

113
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,720
puts it under his microscope just to
think to do this. It's just water.

114
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,140
Why do you think that's something
interesting to do? He said, I wonder,

115
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,341
he was curious.

116
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:24,341
He puts it under and sees little what
he described as Anna macules happily,

117
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,030
uh,
swimming.

118
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:31,030
And I'm acute macules these are like
the Amoebas and paramecium and Oh,

119
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,630
it is. And so he writes a
heat reports on this too,

120
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,370
to the scientific authorities.
And they don't believe him.

121
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:44,670
They say, uh, you know, [inaudible] uh,

122
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:49,310
we think you might have had too much
gin before you wrote this letter.

123
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,480
Why would anyone believe this?
That there's entire creatures,

124
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,600
an entire universe of creatures
thriving in a drop of pond water.

125
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,960
And so the way science works is
one report does not make it true.

126
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,160
You need verification.

127
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:08,270
They send people to the Netherlands to
verify his results and there it was the

128
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:13,010
birth of microscopy and then they
looked at everything sells, you know,

129
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,600
they need vocabulary to describe what
you're now seeing. Well that was the, the,

130
00:08:16,601 --> 00:08:18,470
the,
the journey down small.

131
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:23,120
Then the journey went up big and
Galileo perfects the telescope.

132
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,470
He looks up, he's like, Whoa, I see
craters, mountains, valleys on the moon.

133
00:08:27,471 --> 00:08:31,730
The Sun has spots.
Venus goes through phases.

134
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,240
This became the Corpus of evidence for
earth going around the sun in Supportive

135
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,110
Copernicus's idea that earth
went around the sun. My point is,

136
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,430
what was the second thing he did
with his telescope? He telephone. No,

137
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,080
they didn't tell me.
He contacted the Doge of Venice,

138
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,510
invited him to the clock tower and said,

139
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,360
look at what this instrument can do for
you. As we look out into the lagoon,

140
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,200
you can identify a ship's intentions,

141
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:06,260
friend or foe by its flag 10 times
farther away than you can with the unaided

142
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:08,064
eye.

143
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:14,610
Venice bought a boatload
of these telescopes in the
service of their military

144
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,140
defense,
and this was a source of money to Galileo,

145
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,940
and now he could go look at the universe.

146
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,910
This has been a two way street ever
since. People have looked up. So,

147
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:30,680
so this is, this is an accounting of
that. This is, it's and, and it's it,

148
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:35,040
it goes on and on the first
x ray machines for airports,

149
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:36,630
you're old enough to remember.

150
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,210
Why would they put in because
of hijackings to Cuba,

151
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,240
basically that they were armed hijackings
of airplanes of American carriers to

152
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:48,240
Cuba. And Congress said, we gotta do
something about that. Oh, by the way,

153
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:51,750
there's a company in Boston called
American Science and engineering that was

154
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:53,520
building an x ray detector,

155
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,760
small enough to put on a satellite
to observe the universe in x rays.

156
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,690
And because no one had zipped, we've
used visible light, but not x rays.

157
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,560
That's a branch of the
electromagnetic spectrum.

158
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,170
We think if they're black holes out there,

159
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,960
their region surrounding
them will give us x rays.

160
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:14,610
It's a new window on the universe.
And then they said,

161
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,430
oh my gosh, there's a call for
x ray machines at airports.

162
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,750
We've got the technology that we've
perfected to put it up frickin satellite.

163
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,120
So the technology for those ones,

164
00:10:24,121 --> 00:10:28,800
you walked through the airport
initially came initially? Yes, yes, yes.

165
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,160
There was a two way street. There was, oh
my gosh, we need this for security. Oh,

166
00:10:32,161 --> 00:10:34,140
by God we would, we were
using, let's, let's,

167
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:37,170
let's apply that technology
to these detectors. Well,

168
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:39,430
that's been a lot of the stuff
with the space program. Right.

169
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:43,040
And a lot of the stuff that they devised
for use on the space station and so

170
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,360
many other technologies have
trickled their way down.
