1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,460
The joe rogan experience series or
something along those lines. See,

2
00:00:05,461 --> 00:00:07,190
that's an interesting, uh, I'm,

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,900
I'm absolutely convinced most of these
guys believe what they say now, Ma,

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:15,000
maybe they're bullshitters at the start
or they only partially believe, but they,

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,270
they repeat their rhetoric,
their followers, giving
them positive reinforcement.

6
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:21,000
They come to believe it. And,
uh, you know, David Koresh,

7
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:25,860
he was right down the barrel. He totally
believed, willing to die for his beliefs.

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,740
And he also was having sex with
everybody. Yes. Yes. I mean,

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,370
it's so common.
It's almost cliche.

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,560
And his ex girlfriend grew up in one of
these sort of religious cults and it was

11
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:42,300
the same deal. The head guy was having
sex with all the women and you know,

12
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:45,540
he would have sex with different people's
wives and everybody had to let them,

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,980
yeah. Say do the fundamentalist Mormons.
Um, what's his name that's in jail now?

14
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,790
Jay. Jay. Jeffrey, Jeff,
Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeffrey.

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,770
Jeff Jeffries is JB. I'm thinking of
Jim Jefferies, my friend, the comedian.

16
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,760
Uh, but anyway, yeah, that's, you
know, that's how it gets corrupted.

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,830
I don't know if you ever read John.
Um,

18
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,260
John Crack hours book
under the banner of Heaven.

19
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,100
This is the guy that the mountain climber
that did a into thin air and, and uh,

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,850
and the, um, the one about
the Alaskan kid. Anyway,

21
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:18,180
he wrote this book called under the
banner of the Alaskan Kid who died. Yes.

22
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,900
When they made that movie about
that moving into the wild. Yeah.

23
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:25,800
So he did any of the wild into thin air.
Krakauer's a great writer. So this book,

24
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,370
he starts to investigate
the murder of this, um,

25
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,340
polygamous family in Utah,
just as a journalist.

26
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:34,380
He's going to do a story for
the New Yorker or something.

27
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,160
And then he realizes this takes them
down the path of this incredible world of

28
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:42,480
polygamy, which still goes on now legally.
It's not legal, but they marry one.

29
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,380
And then the others are so called sister
wives and they're just there and they

30
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:50,430
live on these, in these border towns along
the border between Colorado and Utah,

31
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,760
like Colorado city. And I've been
through some of these places. It's like,

32
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,110
it's like a twilight zone episode. You
go into this town gas station, whatever.

33
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:01,140
It's like, oh, it feels
kind of weird here. And, uh,

34
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:03,540
so Krakauer discovered this
whole world of, you know,

35
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:08,460
going all the way back to the
founding of the religion. And, um,

36
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,880
uh, what's the name?
Joseph Smith. And you know,

37
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,490
he gets this revelation
from God that, uh, well,

38
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,490
basically he's banging the woman
down the street, he's married.

39
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,030
And so he gets this revelation from God.
And Krakauer has this,

40
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,840
this scenario in the book where
he tells his wife, now, honey,

41
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:28,350
I've been talking to God and you're
not going to believe this, but he says,

42
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:31,950
I have to marry this, you know, so and
so down the street, she's like, oh yeah,

43
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,240
well I have to start
seeing other guide. No, no.

44
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:40,350
God was very specific about this.
It's just for the guys. And,

45
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:43,920
and how do I know you talked to him?
Well, my buddies, they were there.

46
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:45,810
They heard it also.
And this is the,

47
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,540
the first page of the book
of Mormon is an affidavit.

48
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,810
These are the people that heard the
revelation and there they all sign it.

49
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,420
And it's like, okay, so
this is how it starts.

50
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,030
And Joseph Smith started it all
off in 1820. He's only 14. Yes,

51
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,490
it's me. A 14 year old is not a liar.
That's right. They just learn that a lie.

52
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,640
It's an even like that. They're bad
people. When you're 14 years old,

53
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:11,350
you are a developing entity. You know,
your frontal lobes are not fully formed.

54
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:13,870
You don't really know what
you're practicing sentences,

55
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,620
you know what you're doing,
trying to exert your influence.

56
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:20,500
And this guy was just very creative.
He was,

57
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:24,100
and he got chased out of Palmyra.
New York is where he started.

58
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:27,460
And then he moved to Missouri
when basically he was in
trouble with the law and,

59
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,520
and other issues. And then he got in
trouble there and he was killed. And it,

60
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,600
usually, this ends a cult when the leader
dies. Now there's, there's a kind of a,

61
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,060
there's a critical period if you get
a new dynamic leader to take over.

62
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:41,830
Like in the case of Scientology,
um,

63
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,540
David Miscavige took over after l Ron
Hubbard passed over to the other side and,

64
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,000
uh, he managed to keep it going.
And same thing with Brigham Young.

65
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:53,410
It was bringing me young that turned this
little cult into a world religion and

66
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:57,130
they just went further west to Utah
to get away from federal authorities.

67
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,880
Now how much of a hit is
Scientology taking from that,

68
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:03,950
Leah Remini I don't,
we don't even,

69
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,270
I've not seen any data like a memberships
and they're all secret about that

70
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:11,590
anyway. It's proprietary data, so who
knows? I can't imagine they could survive.

71
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:15,100
Well, they could survive because they
have tons of money through real estate

72
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:15,611
investments,

73
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:19,330
but I can't imagine their numbers are or
could be doing anything but shrinking.

74
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,160
Yeah. Between the Lawrence Wright
book than the Hbo Documentary Feature.

75
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,230
Just crossed stuff crappy.
Yeah,

76
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,890
and your dialogue with with
Aaliyah was incredible. And cheese.

77
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:34,480
Just a hero amongst, you know, seculars
that fight against colts. That's really,

78
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:36,370
that's really the,
the best way to do it.

79
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,940
Not top down laws against cults
unless they're doing something.

80
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,090
He'll obviously illegal,
but just bottom up members speaking.

81
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,640
I had David Miscavige has dad
on as well. Right. That was,

82
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,600
that was sad.

83
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,740
That was sad because I felt like I was
talking to a guy who felt like he wasted

84
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:56,230
his life and lost his son.
Right.

85
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,230
And brought his son into Scientology.

86
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:03,820
The whole thing was that was
really disturbing. Yup. Just a,

87
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:08,530
it's just very strange that the United
States government is allowing those

88
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:12,130
people to be tax exempt. I mean, with
all the evidence that's available,

89
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:17,250
you just go and look at what they're
proposing and what they believe in the

90
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:21,720
Thetis and the frozens entities.
They're dropped into the volcano.

91
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:25,510
All the crazy shell, the
story about there, this is
what really worried me about,

92
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,850
um, the IRS. I mean, I've
always thought, you know,

93
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:31,930
I don't fear it hell or the devil,
but I fear the IRS, you know, I take,

94
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:32,980
I'm pretty careful about that,

95
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,670
but they're the only major organization
I've ever seen that beat the IRS.

96
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:39,400
And they did it through,
uh, thousands of lawsuits.

97
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:42,180
I think they sued him like
3,500 times or something. Well,

98
00:05:42,181 --> 00:05:46,810
they sent every single member that they
could get to do it to them as well.

99
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,860
They were getting all their members
to sue it. They were suing. Right?

100
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,090
That was the story. Isn't
that how it worked? Yeah.

101
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:57,060
And then eventually the IRS just
said, okay, if I get your tax exempt,

102
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,700
I mean, if they're letting the Mormons
do it and why wouldn't they let the

103
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,330
scientologist? Yes sir. I really don't
think any religion shipped. I agree.

104
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:09,700
It's ridiculous. I agree. I mean in 2018
with what we know about reality, right?

105
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,860
The fact that we let some old voodoo
superstitious nonsense and not have to pay

106
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:18,980
taxes and exert extreme power politically,
socially,

107
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,400
economically, it's crazy. Well,
so, and they like preachers get up,

108
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,410
they can live in a house, tag three,
then you have to pay property tax on the,

109
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,130
on the home that they own.
You know?

110
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:31,430
So there's a lot of these side benefits
also that you don't normally hear about

111
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,330
gross.

112
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,720
So the freedom from religion foundation
and some of these other organisations,

113
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:40,070
ACLU or you know, trying to combat
some of this, but, but legally,

114
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,940
how do you distinguish that from say a
nonprofit like doctors without borders or

115
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:48,640
one of these other groups that Clinton
Foundation killing whales. Yeah,

116
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,390
yeah,
yeah.

117
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:53,540
There was some statistic recently in
the Clinton Foundation how much money in

118
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:57,740
night in 2014 they actually
donate to cherry. Oh Christ.

119
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,880
It was like 6% something like
extremely low. The rest of it.

120
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:05,600
But payroll and yeah, mostly expenses.
Private mean that's what it is.

121
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:09,830
And they're scams. All these things
are scams. Yeah. It's just, yeah,

122
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:12,080
it might be good to just clean house and,
and just,

123
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:16,560
no one gets a new nonprofit status or
tax free status unless you're just,

124
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,590
well I don't know.
I mean I think,

125
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,220
I feel like there was room in the world
for compassionate charities that are

126
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:25,070
actual charities that
are really legitimate.

127
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,670
There's room in the world for them and
I think that they should have tax exempt

128
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:32,420
status, but I think we should
be really stringent. Right.
And about what we accept.

129
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,830
Um,
yeah.

130
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:37,130
Well the Supreme Court then they have a
PR problem is where do you draw the line?

131
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,730
You know, cause somebody says,
well I have a goofy belief.

132
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,910
The Jane's have some weird beliefs or
something, but you know, but their,

133
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,230
but their man in the soup kitchens,

134
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,210
they're helping the poor
and there's no corruption.

135
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,690
So w w what's the difference between
them and the Scientologists and say, Hey,

136
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,620
you know, we have our own
religious beliefs that to use
sound goofy, but you know,

137
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:56,870
to us their true.
What's the difference?

138
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:01,280
Well the Mormons are fascinating to me
because they do seem goofy when you look

139
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,230
at the idea that Joseph Smith,

140
00:08:03,231 --> 00:08:07,910
who was a 14 year old found golden tablets
that contained a loss work of Jesus

141
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,480
and only he could read them cause
he had a magic seers stone, right?

142
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,320
And then when the local townspeople came
to see, well where are these stones?

143
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:19,430
All the angels came and took them away
because they do not believe like it's so

144
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:23,870
preposterous. But Mormons are
really nice people. Totally Nice.

145
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,010
They're the sweetest,
nicest way.

146
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,520
I think they've made the transition
from cult to religion, a religious sect.

147
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:35,090
And most, most Christians no
longer consider them a cult.

148
00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:36,950
Some evangelicals do cause
they're pretty far out.

149
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:40,250
But most mainstream Christian said,
yeah, yeah, they're Christians.

150
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:44,150
I mean they accept Jesus as their savior
and that technically that gets you in

151
00:08:44,151 --> 00:08:48,140
the club. They just got to
let all that Joseph Smith
stuff go. Yeah. Cause they're,

152
00:08:48,141 --> 00:08:50,820
the way they treat people
is fantastic. I mean, yeah,

153
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:55,770
I'm not a big fan of them going to these
poor countries and proselytizing and

154
00:08:55,771 --> 00:08:59,070
you know, getting these
vulnerable people to become part.

155
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,240
But I think the way they deal with
community and the way they deal with each

156
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:07,410
other, it's like a very, it's a very
warm and friendly and family environment.

157
00:09:07,411 --> 00:09:10,440
And most of the Mormons that
I've met that are practicing,

158
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:12,010
I've been very nice people and they're,

159
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,690
and they're serious about their tithing
and the 10% I mean they have strict

160
00:09:15,691 --> 00:09:18,650
rules about this, like capital gains.
Then it's a quilt on cafeteria.

161
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,580
So if you sell your
house and make a profit,

162
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:22,860
you got to give 10% of that to church,
not just your income,

163
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,730
not just your paycheck. Yeah. And they,
they're pretty, pretty strict about that.

164
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,530
And I'm a, and the
money, as far as I know,

165
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:32,460
mostly goes for good causes that
really does help poor people

166
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,450
[inaudible]
okay.
