1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,470
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:08,130
What do you say to someone who is happy
with what they do lives a fulfilled life

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,390
exercises and is still depressed?
Yes. I thought a lot about this,

4
00:00:13,391 --> 00:00:15,670
but remind me to come back to the thing
about east London. I know this is,

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,560
this is an issue with a
lot of people. I, yeah,

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,040
I know people that worship at the altar
of science and modern medicine that

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,280
firmly believe that all depression is
because of some sort of chemical imbalance

8
00:00:26,321 --> 00:00:30,370
in the brain in anything that debates
that are anything that disputes that

9
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:33,970
notion is, is pisses them off.
Yeah. No, I understand that.

10
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:36,640
And I would've been like that for me.
That, yeah, of course I was looking at,

11
00:00:36,641 --> 00:00:39,480
I met him in a year. Do you get
that? Some people responded.

12
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,230
Sure, of course. Of course. I think the,

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,010
so the World Health Organization is the
leading medical body in the world, right?

14
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:50,570
They did a survey study of all the best
evidence and they explained very clearly

15
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:55,250
that the mental health, um,
is a social indicator, right?

16
00:00:55,251 --> 00:00:58,340
It has social causes that need social
solutions as well as individual solutions.

17
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:03,140
The science of this is overwhelming. You
won't get many scientists who say, uh,

18
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,560
in fact, it'd be struggled to find any
scientists who say depression is purely a

19
00:01:06,561 --> 00:01:07,880
biological phenomenon.
Right?

20
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,330
Pretty much everyone agrees there's
some social and psychological component.

21
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:12,650
I think when we,

22
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,650
this weird disconnect between what the
scientists know and what the public is

23
00:01:15,651 --> 00:01:20,450
told, right? I don't know anyone
who went to their doctor who, um,

24
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:25,250
apart from this wonderful doctor in east
London and we can talk about who went

25
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:25,700
with depression.
I,

26
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,930
that he was told anything other than
a biological story I'm in there,

27
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:30,640
may be asked, you know, some of them
were asked about childhood, you know,

28
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,570
what was your childhood like?
And referred to a therapist,

29
00:01:32,571 --> 00:01:35,150
but no one was talking about these wider
social causes. No one started like,

30
00:01:35,151 --> 00:01:36,640
do you feel controlled
at work? Well, like I,

31
00:01:36,641 --> 00:01:39,740
it's a fact that could be
making you make you depressed,

32
00:01:39,741 --> 00:01:44,630
but in terms of the people who, who,
um, who are depressed but don't,

33
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,080
uh, cause there was a mystery to
me. Right? I knew people, I thought,

34
00:01:47,081 --> 00:01:49,520
but this guy has got everything
and he feels he's still depressed.

35
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:52,010
What's going on here? I think
there's two things to say about that.

36
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:56,870
One is I started to, for various
reasons for research for something else,

37
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:00,830
I was reading some like feminist
texts from the early sixties right?

38
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,220
And a really common thing that happened
in the early sixties is women would go

39
00:02:04,221 --> 00:02:06,350
to their doctor and they'd say,
doctor,

40
00:02:06,351 --> 00:02:07,790
there's something really
wrong with my nerves,

41
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:10,710
people to talk about in terms of nerves.
Then we don't do that anymore. Uh,

42
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,000
something really wrong with my nerds
because I've got everything a woman could

43
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:17,650
possibly want. I've got a husband
who doesn't beat me. I've got a car,

44
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,530
got a washing machine, I've got two
kids, but I feel like shit. Right?

45
00:02:21,531 --> 00:02:24,080
And the doctor would go, you're
right, and give a value. Now,

46
00:02:24,081 --> 00:02:27,620
if we could travel back in time and speak
to those women, what we'd say is right.

47
00:02:27,621 --> 00:02:31,130
You've got everything you could possibly
want by the standards of the culture.

48
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,330
But Stan is the cultural,
just wrong, right? As a w as
a woman, as a human being,

49
00:02:35,331 --> 00:02:37,970
you need more than just a
washing machine and a car. Right?

50
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:40,640
You need a fulfilling life
of meaning and purpose.

51
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,940
And a very similar thing I
think is happening today if
you, so if you don't want,

52
00:02:43,941 --> 00:02:46,670
I speak to people who say
I've got everything I could
want but I feel like share.

53
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,650
So tell me,
tell me about your life.

54
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,660
Very often they're working really hard
in prestigious jobs that they don't like.

55
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:58,070
They don't enjoy hour by hour to buy
things that don't give them pleasure.

56
00:02:58,071 --> 00:03:00,700
It comes back to this hijacking junk
values that we're talking about.

57
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:02,620
The professor Tim Kasser discovered.

58
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:07,060
So what you've got is because we've been
told a totally misleading story about

59
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,460
what makes us satisfied
and happy as human beings.

60
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,040
I think it comes up again and
again in the interviews you do,

61
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,780
cause we'd been taught in different ways
because we've been told them misleading

62
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,790
story about that we live our lives
according to the wrong script.

63
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,040
We feel like shit.
And rather than question the script,

64
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,350
we think there must be something
wrong with us biologically.

65
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,810
Now there are biological contributions.
It's supported to say that,

66
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:29,890
but one of things that really blew my
mind on this was um, Ainsley this woman,

67
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,980
amazing social scientists could
not to Bretford in Berkeley,

68
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,320
she did this research. It's kind of
simple research. It just asked. Um,

69
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:44,140
if you consciously decided you were
going to spend more hours a day trying to

70
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:47,500
make yourself happier, would you
actually become happier? Right.

71
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:48,970
And they did this research.

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,590
She didn't do a loan obviously with our
colleagues in the United States, Japan,

73
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,690
Russia,
and Taiwan.

74
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:01,000
And what they found was in the u s
if you try to make yourself happier

75
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:04,870
consciously, you do not become
happier in the other countries.

76
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,160
If you try to make yourself happier, you
do become happier. And they were like,

77
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,050
what's going on?
So they did more research.

78
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,890
And what they discovered was in the
u s and I spent a lot more time here,

79
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:17,980
but in Britain as well,
if you try to make yourself happier,

80
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,270
you try to do something generally for
yourself, you buy something for yourself.

81
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:22,951
Your biggest self,

82
00:04:22,951 --> 00:04:27,670
our PA tried to get a promotion and the
other countries generally if you try to

83
00:04:27,671 --> 00:04:30,220
make yourself happy or you do
something for someone else, right?

84
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,450
You try to help your friends, your family,
your community. Where, what countries?

85
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,500
Just Japan, Russia and China is most
of the really stress this, that if you,

86
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,990
this is a part of their culture
that if you want to be happy,

87
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:42,960
you do something for
someone else. It's, it's,

88
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:47,020
it's so implicit in the culture that
they live collectively that it's not even

89
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,520
just like we wouldn't even if you said,

90
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,500
do you think happiness is an
individualistic thing? We'd be like,

91
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:54,730
what are you even talking about? Isn't
that sort of an extrinsic idea as well?

92
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,820
The idea that you're going to be happy
by trying to make other people happy,

93
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,310
but this is a thing. So intrinsic values
are not about just internal to yourself,

94
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,350
the things that you value.

95
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:05,290
So your intrinsic value could be
spending time with your kids, right.

96
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:09,070
That was probably most people strongest
intrinsic value if their parents is

97
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:10,830
being with their kids,
bonding with their kids.

98
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:15,830
A lot of my point is if your goal is to
get happy and the way you've chosen to

99
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:19,660
get happy is I'm going to get happy
by making other people happy. That's,

100
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:24,650
that seems very strange. I don't think
so. If you think about where humans are.

101
00:05:24,651 --> 00:05:28,150
Dot. Shouldn't you just make other
people happy because you love them.

102
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,550
But that is a way of loving people
and being present with them is a way,

103
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,600
but not as like a specific for with a
specific goal of making yourself happy.

104
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,350
That seems, that's not why they do
it. It's not like when they were told,

105
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:44,860
make yourself happy. They had an implicit
script in their culture, which is like,

106
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,970
all right,
if I want to make myself happy,

107
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,850
I'll spend time with other people
or do things with other people.

108
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,550
But if you think about it in terms of
human evolution, it makes total sense,

109
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:55,210
right? I think about our
ancestors where they evolved.

110
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,180
If you were in, uh, a gripper,

111
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,220
if our ancestors had been individually
who were out to big up themselves as

112
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:05,180
individuals, we wouldn't be
having this conversation.
Right? Right. So it makes us,

113
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:08,880
we evolved as a species with instincts.
The argument there,

114
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,120
the motivation of trying to get
happy by helping other people.

115
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,900
It just seems be some implicit in the
culture for most people in say China that

116
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,800
they wouldn't even articulate it that way.
It's only if you force them to say,

117
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,490
look, try to make yourself happier that
they, then the script becomes obvious.

118
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:27,860
It's implicit,
but this script that we have,

119
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:32,180
this idea that the way you make yourself
happier is as an individual, you know,

120
00:06:32,181 --> 00:06:37,010
just doing something for yourself and
how you hold because there is not one

121
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:39,200
script and this country of
how to make yourself happy.

122
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:43,100
I think that's some sort of disingenuous
as I did at the only way to make

123
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:47,660
yourself happy is to do that. What?
That's not what people are trying to do.

124
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,530
What people were trying to do is be
successful and I don't think they

125
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:54,110
necessarily equate success with happiness.

126
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:58,430
What would they do equate success with
is an alleviation of debt and alleviation

127
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:01,520
of problems and alleviation of a
lot of the issues that people face.

128
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,750
Hartley and they think of that as if you
look at the problems that you have when

129
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:07,190
you're growing up,
you look at the price.

130
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:09,680
Especially if you grow
up in a poor family,

131
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,580
one of the main problems that you face is
you're worried about paying your bills.

132
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,510
So you say, someday I'm going to get to
a point where that is no longer an issue.

133
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:20,740
I'm going to make it.
I'm going to be successful there.

134
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,770
They're not doing it thinking this
is going to make me happy. I, I've,

135
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,430
I've very rarely see that and which
is one of the reasons why people,

136
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,820
even people's parents in
this freaks me the fuck out.

137
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,580
We'll tell them to not
pursue their dreams,

138
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,970
but instead to pursue something
that's more likely to happen.

139
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,480
Like don't pursue your dream of becoming
an actor or a singer or whatever it is.

140
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,623
Instead,

141
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,740
pursue your dream of being the foreman
at the company you work at because that's

142
00:07:48,741 --> 00:07:49,574
attainable.

143
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,780
I think you're totally right and there's
a lot of evidence that you're right,

144
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:57,650
that the financial anxiety is a massive
driver of depression and anxiety.

145
00:07:57,651 --> 00:08:01,820
Obviously there's a interesting study
that found people who have an income from

146
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:06,020
property are 10 times less
likely to develop an anxiety
disorder that people who

147
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:06,770
don't,

148
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,200
and there was a really interesting
experiment in how we can respond to that.

149
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,600
It's when that President
Obama said late in his time,

150
00:08:11,601 --> 00:08:14,210
he thinks would have to happen across
the country in the next 20 years for

151
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:18,830
various reasons. So in Canada, in
the 70s, the Canadian government,

152
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,820
um, chose a town at random, it
seems to genuinely have been random.

153
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:26,690
It's tackled doe fan. It's, um, anyone who
knows, uh, Kendra, it's about four hours.

154
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,380
I Winnepeg and they said to big
group of people in this town,

155
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,310
we're going to give you guys for
the net for the foreseeable future.

156
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:37,490
We're going to give all of
you a guaranteed basic income.

157
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:40,640
We're going to give you the equivalent
of, in today's money, 15,000 US dollars.

158
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:42,290
Right?
There's nothing you can do.

159
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:45,470
That means we'll take it away from you
and there's nothing you have to do in

160
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:47,570
return for it.
We're just citizens of our country.

161
00:08:47,571 --> 00:08:48,890
We want you to have a good life,
right?

162
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,080
It was partly because they
had a kind of welfare system,

163
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:53,690
but it was a lot of people were falling
through the cracks and they wanted to do

164
00:08:53,691 --> 00:08:54,940
a little experiment to see what this web,

165
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,710
and this was studied very carefully by
a woman name to be called Dots Evelyn

166
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:02,420
Bouygues, uh, to see what happened. It
loads of interesting things happened. Um,

167
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,420
people spent more time with their kids.
Very few people quit work,

168
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,480
but a lot of people
turns down shitty jobs.

169
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:13,080
So actual overall work standards improved
because employers have to attract

170
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:16,500
people with better
standards. Um, but for me,

171
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:20,220
the most interesting thing is there was
a huge fall in depression and anxiety,

172
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,880
depression and anxiety. That was so
severe. People had to be hospitalized,

173
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:28,260
fell by 9%,
which is remarkable in just three years.

174
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,890
And then the program ended. Dr for Jay
said to me, I thought so much about that,

175
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:36,280
that I'd learned about
the cow. Dot. Vj said, um,

176
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,410
you know, that's an antidepressant, right?

177
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,810
We should expand our idea of an
antidepressant to be anything that reduces

178
00:09:42,811 --> 00:09:45,930
depression and that should include
pills, but also, so you're totally right.

179
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:49,620
I mean, look, I grew up, my dad, my dad's
a bus driver, my mom worked in a shelter,

180
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,680
my grandmother cleaned toilets. Financial
anxiety is a massive driver of, um,

181
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,580
of the despair.
This,

182
00:09:56,581 --> 00:10:00,780
I mean more than half of all Americans
have not because of the incredible

183
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:04,800
financial pressure they've been put on,
the got $500 set aside for,

184
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:08,420
for crisis comes along. Right. So
you're talking about that's a huge draw.

185
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,140
And again, that's really
important cause explain to people,

186
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,970
if that's making you depressed an anxious,

187
00:10:11,971 --> 00:10:15,270
don't let a doctor tell you you've just
got a chemical imbalance in your brain.

188
00:10:15,271 --> 00:10:19,190
Right. That's, we'll do doctors
still say that all the time.

189
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,200
My nephew's best friend,
um,

190
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,000
just literally a couple of weeks ago
went to the doctor and was told, yeah,

191
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:25,230
you've got a dopamine and balance.

192
00:10:25,231 --> 00:10:28,530
The doctor said is migrated in the 20
years since I went there from a surgeon in

193
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:29,780
England,
in England.

194
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,700
I mean I get contacted constantly by
people who were being told they've got

195
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:34,550
chemicals, they're told they've
got chemical imbalances.

196
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,000
Right.

197
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,750
Are they just as likely to prescribe
antidepressants in English as they are

198
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,170
American? I'm slightly low, but it's
still exceptionally high still. Yeah.

199
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,631
There's a,

200
00:10:44,631 --> 00:10:49,220
that narrative that an antidepressant
must be in some sort of a pill form and

201
00:10:49,221 --> 00:10:53,530
that navy, even the expression,
antidepressant and antidepressant, it's,

202
00:10:53,531 --> 00:10:57,530
it's a very confusing thing that we've
sort of adopted very quickly in this

203
00:10:57,531 --> 00:11:01,850
country. And it's a relatively
recent, you know, over the last 60,

204
00:11:01,851 --> 00:11:06,810
70 years. And the people that
have antidepressants, uh,

205
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:10,910
in their body that take them all
the time and swear by them, boy,

206
00:11:10,911 --> 00:11:14,420
if you try to tell them in,
in any way that there's a better option,

207
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,630
they get extremely
defensive. Um, I have friend,

208
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:22,160
she's very smart and she's,
she's one of the, um,

209
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,773
one of the people that,

210
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,760
well,
you know,

211
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:31,070
very aggressively debate this idea
that it's anything but a chemical,

212
00:11:31,071 --> 00:11:35,090
depression, chemical, a
inbounds, you know, but she
doesn't take care of her body.

213
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:39,470
She's not, doesn't exercise all the time.
You know, she's slightly overweight.

214
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:43,660
She doesn't eat the best foods. You
know, it's, it's, it's a weird thing.

215
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,530
She's living in a society and culture
that has all these forces that are arising

216
00:11:47,531 --> 00:11:49,180
that makes people feel
terrible. Right? Yeah.

217
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,060
And so a big thing to me is
when I'm talking to this,

218
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:53,950
because I've had some of that reaction,
well not too much,

219
00:11:53,951 --> 00:11:56,720
but I've had some of that reaction
as well. First thing for me to see,

220
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,230
I would say I want to
expand the menu of options.

221
00:11:59,231 --> 00:12:01,930
I don't want to take anything off
the table, right? It's not about,

222
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:05,980
you see that and I, and I think
you're probably being pretty honest,

223
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,990
but you really do want to,
you want to eliminate Mo,

224
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,650
but just by the standard of improvement,

225
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,600
you do probably want to take most people
off of antidepressants, don't you?

226
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:20,470
What need do they have a choice?
Would Jordan analogy,

227
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,110
obesity is massively risen
in the western world.

228
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,630
It hasn't risen because people
suddenly became greedy and lazy.

229
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,520
It's risen because our
food system is terrible.

230
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:29,050
The way feed supply system is terrible.

231
00:12:29,051 --> 00:12:31,480
And we built cities that people
can't walk and bicycle around, right?

232
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,360
And they're really stressed all the time
and they get home from work exhausted.

233
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:37,510
So they don't have time to exercise
a lot of them in that context.

234
00:12:37,511 --> 00:12:40,780
Some people will do what's the stomach
stapling, liposuction, that kind of thing.

235
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,750
Right now I'm not against that.

236
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,560
But if we change the society in the way
that I would want to with obesity so

237
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:51,760
that people could walk and cycle and you
know, they had access to healthy food,

238
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,270
far fewer people would need stomach
stapling or liposuction. Right.

239
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,040
So I would drugs,
not a perfect analogy,

240
00:12:57,041 --> 00:13:00,820
but I'd say if the social changes
that I want to happen happen,

241
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:04,180
if we followed the places that
have succeeded in reducing
depression and anxiety

242
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,321
over time,

243
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:09,220
you would see fewer people feeling they
needed and chemical antidepressants.

244
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:18,870
Okay.
