1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,180
One of the biggest mind blowing moments
I think of my limited comprehension of

2
00:00:06,961 --> 00:00:11,961
what it means to be a living being was
when I found out that carbon and all the

3
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:17,670
stuff that makes us has to come
out of a dying star, like the,

4
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:18,361
that alone,

5
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:23,361
that there's this very strange cycle of
these enormous fireballs that forge the

6
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:30,750
material that makes Brian
Cox. Yeah. Like what?

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:31,591
That,

8
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:36,591
that one alone that there
is some strange loop of,

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:37,610
of,

10
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:42,610
of biological life that comes from stars,

11
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:45,840
which is like no most elemental
thing that we can observe.

12
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:48,900
We see these things in the skin,
we see the sun in the sky.

13
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:53,901
It's this all powerful ball of fire and
that that is where the building blocks

14
00:00:55,621 --> 00:01:00,060
for a person come from. And I said,
and they will be from the carbon.

15
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:01,470
That's him tonight,
buddy. That you're right.

16
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:05,700
They all got made in stars because they
would, does none of it at the big bang.

17
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,640
There's only hydrogen and helium, tiny
bit of lithium to be precise, but no,

18
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,613
nothing else.

19
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,580
And so it was all made in styles and
he's probably from different styles.

20
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:15,900
You know, the, the seems in your buddy,

21
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:18,330
they're not all from one style
that cooks it and then died.

22
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,590
There'll be a mixture of stuff
for many styles in your body now.

23
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,470
And I agree with you. The, the, what
more do you want? You know, when I,

24
00:01:26,471 --> 00:01:30,300
when I see people, the guy I want, I want
more than that. I wasn't, but you know,

25
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,380
there must be more to it. What do you
mean the, the, the, we have, we have,

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,240
we were the ingredients now buddy to
assembled in the house of long dead stars

27
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:43,460
over billions of years and the assembled
themselves spontaneously and to

28
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,280
temporary structures that can think
and feel and explore and then there's

29
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:50,610
structures will decay
away again at some point.

30
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,450
And in the very far future there'll be
no structures left. So, so there we are,

31
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:58,620
we exist in this little window when we
can observe this magnificent universe.

32
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,240
Why do you want any more?
I think to people, well,

33
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,380
I think a lot of people aren't aware
of all the, all the information, right?

34
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,080
And then I think on top of it,
for some people it's just,

35
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,520
it's so overwhelming the this,

36
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:19,521
this concept of 13.8 billion years of
everything to get to this point that we're

37
00:02:20,671 --> 00:02:21,504
at right now,

38
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,950
it's so overwhelming that they want to
simplify it and want to put it into some

39
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:27,840
sort of a fable structure.

40
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,140
Something where it's something that's
very common and similar and familiar.

41
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,520
Yeah. I, I agree and, and,
but I think that's the,

42
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,990
the, is the, the, the
journey that we go on,

43
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,460
the real treasure,

44
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,740
I think is in that journey of
trying to face the incomprehensible.

45
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,630
It's,
it's in that realization that it's almost,

46
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,580
it's almost impossible to believe that we
exist. Right? Yeah, that's right. That's,

47
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:03,070
that's, that's a wonderful thing. Yeah.

48
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,710
And I think that that's
what I think you miss out.

49
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,610
I think if you decide to simplify it,
because you don't want to face that,

50
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:14,350
so you don't want to face the infinity
that's out there in front of us and you

51
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:17,060
don't want to face those
stories as you said, that,

52
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:22,130
that you look at your finger and it's
ingredients cooked in multiple styles over

53
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,880
billions of years.
That that's said to me,

54
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:28,060
it a joyous and powerful
thing to think about,

55
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,570
and I think you're missing out
if you don't want to face that.
