1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,630
There's a lot of people that are dying
in Mexico because the cartel violence,

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:04,261
you know,

3
00:00:04,261 --> 00:00:08,940
we were talking about that Jamal could
Shogi guy before the podcast started and

4
00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:11,460
how disturbing this whole thing is.

5
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:16,140
And the plot for folks who don't know
what we're talking about l fill people in

6
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,390
on. Okay, sure. So, uh, Jamal,

7
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:23,391
because Shogi is a journalist who actually
worked for the Washington Post and he

8
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:28,521
went into the Saudi embassy in Turkey to
get a marriage license in his Stan bolt

9
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:29,650
to get a marriage license.

10
00:00:29,651 --> 00:00:34,651
So for him and his wife and he
never got out day killed him,

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:35,843
dismembered him,

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,360
used a bone saw and then they even went
as far as to cover it up where they had

13
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:43,650
a body double go in and they gave him
a fake beard and they had him wear his

14
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:48,030
clothes and walk out. Is there video of
the body? There is, there is. In fact,

15
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:52,110
CNN had it. I know yesterday I was
looking at the CNN video that had it. Um,

16
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,010
so yeah, Saudi Arabia now brazenly killing
journalists. And I'll tell you what,

17
00:00:56,011 --> 00:00:58,560
you came up with a bunch of different
versions of the story too. Yeah,

18
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,680
but why they did it. Here's the
body. There you go. Here's him.

19
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,020
And then the guy on the right with hair.

20
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,570
Why would they have a guy
with hair as a body double?

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,920
Think about how much this had to be
planned out to have a body double. Right?

22
00:01:10,921 --> 00:01:13,770
But why did they give the body w bubble?
If you're going to be a body,

23
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:16,140
double shave your head dude. The
other guy's bald. That's crazy.

24
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,580
So they didn't even do a good
job at faking their murder,

25
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:25,230
but it's the worst fake ever. Yeah. Cause
the guys get a full head of hair. Yeah.

26
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:30,200
It's not great. No, it's
terrible. How shoes on too?
He had different shoes. Yeah,

27
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,980
I mean that's,
that's the worst body double.

28
00:01:32,981 --> 00:01:36,120
It's got dark hair and they're
saying this is the guy. Look,

29
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:40,170
he's fine walking around. No issues.
It's a body double knot. A hair double,

30
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:44,400
I guess. I mean, if you can
have a body double shave,

31
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:47,280
the guy's fucking heads tell you walked
into a different shirt and everything.

32
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,660
Oh, that's a body double. Yeah, so
his hair colors different too. I mean,

33
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:53,850
he's got dark hair.
This guy's got gray here.

34
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,590
The thing that's driving me nuts about
this is so now this is getting a lot of

35
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:00,990
press attention and I'm happy it's getting
a lot of press attention, of course.

36
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:05,340
But the reason why it is is because he's
part of the elite class in the sense

37
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:07,440
that he's a journalist and now you have
the people from the New York Times and

38
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:09,690
the Washington Post and CNN and they
can relate and they go, oh my God,

39
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:11,100
they're killing journalists.
Now this is crazy.

40
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:12,480
Look at the precedent that this sets,

41
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,480
but what people don't know is
for the past two or three years,

42
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,260
Saudi Arabia has been waging
a literal genocide in Yemen,

43
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,990
and that's not an exaggeration.
So they blockaded the country.

44
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:25,470
They're not allowing in medicine, there's
a cholera epidemic happening there.

45
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:26,640
Millions of people are sick.

46
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,640
They have people dying of starvation
because they're not allowing in food or

47
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:32,970
humanitarian aid. They're bombing
hospitals, they're bombing schools,

48
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,570
they're bombing open air markets.
So they're doing a literal genocide.

49
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:38,220
And that got very little coverage,

50
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,340
but then with this journalist now
finally starting to get some coverage,

51
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:44,910
but I'm curious what happens
moving forward in terms
of how will the US respond

52
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:47,220
to it?
Because as I'm sure you already know this,

53
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,300
I mean they care more about that $110
billion weapons deal that they just had

54
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:54,480
with the Saudis and they do about the
lives of humanities or the lives of

55
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:59,280
journalists. Yeah. The, the idea
of him being really valuable.

56
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,770
It's not, it's not just that
he's a part of the elite.

57
00:03:01,771 --> 00:03:05,810
It's that there was a conspiracy to do
so that they think came from upon high.

58
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,693
Yeah.
Right.

59
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,990
And there was 15 people
that they're saying flew in
from Saudi Arabia and one of

60
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:15,640
them was a forensics expert who
like knows how to cover up evidence,

61
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,140
knows what evidence is, what
it feels like a movie. Did.

62
00:03:19,141 --> 00:03:22,700
The bone saw things that been confirmed.
They know they had a bone saw.

63
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,201
I heard that.

64
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:28,201
Now the nickname for him in Washington
DC is what they say bone saw a salmon,

65
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,340
his name is Mohammad bin Salman.

66
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:34,660
They're calling him bone saw Solomon or
something like that. Yeah, dude, it is.

67
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,000
The stuff that's going
on is just scary to me.

68
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:39,850
And then there's also some interesting
geopolitical stuff happening around this.

69
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:44,650
The head of Turkey is now using this as
an issue to try to snuggle up to the u s

70
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:48,130
because he's got ambitions where he wants
to like recreate the Ottoman Empire.

71
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,840
And of course Muhammad Bin Salman,

72
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,750
he has ambitions where he wants
to dominate the Middle East.

73
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,370
So you have at the same time,

74
00:03:54,371 --> 00:03:58,990
this weird ego battle between a Air
Diwan and Mohammed bin Salman and they're

75
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:03,280
all trying to suck up to the
u s to, you know, basically
get it so that, uh, we can,

76
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,010
we do favors for them and
we allow them to expand.

77
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,440
And on top of that, there, the
story's changed multiple times. Right?

78
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,240
It's the story of what
happened five times.

79
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,170
First they said nothing happened to
them, to him. Then they said, oh,

80
00:04:16,171 --> 00:04:20,740
you got out fight and now they're
saying that he was killed by people who

81
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:23,980
overstep their bounds. That's right.
Yeah. They keep changing the store.

82
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:26,380
And there's also stories that the,

83
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,930
the consulate has video and
audio evidence of the murder.

84
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,070
That's what Turkey saying.
Yeah,

85
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,730
but they don't want to release it
because then people will know how they're

86
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:40,540
spying on them when they visit the
consulate. I guess so I didn't see that,

87
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,270
but I'll take your word for it. Yeah.
That was to see if you can find that.

88
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,730
That was one of the things
that was brought up yesterday,

89
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:51,040
that they don't want to release this video
and audio evidence because if they do,

90
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,850
then other people will know how they're
spying on them when they visit. Yeah,

91
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,620
I could see that.
I mean,

92
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:01,690
they should immediately cut off
the arms deal with Saudi Arabia,

93
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,630
no more weapons for a regime that's
doing the stuff that they're doing.

94
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:09,220
And we already knew that they behead
people in the public square for sorcery,

95
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,900
sorcery. Do they really?
Yes. For witchcraft.

96
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,960
You don't to see for drug smuggling that
they behead people in the public square

97
00:05:16,961 --> 00:05:17,560
for those things.
