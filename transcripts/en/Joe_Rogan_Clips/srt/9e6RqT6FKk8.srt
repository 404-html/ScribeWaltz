1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,340
The joe rogan experience. I
love Oprah. Don't get me wrong.

2
00:00:05,341 --> 00:00:06,750
I think she's a wonderful woman.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,560
I think she's a powerful force of good
and positive energy, which ain't no Eli,

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,880
but she also brought us doctor Oz and
the secret we have to remember with this

5
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:22,140
lady has done, she has to be
held accountable. I forgive her,

6
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:24,210
but I mean cut the shit.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,670
The secret is a particularly egregious
offense. What you don't, you just, Oh,

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,470
you don't believe,
don't believe who believe.

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,350
I want to be rich.
I just am rich.

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,130
I imagine myself flying.
I can fly.

11
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,650
I will beat my wings until
I take off what's up.

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,960
Yeah,
it was one of the more confused,

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,920
I want us to be disturbing,

14
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:55,110
but it was confusing when that
was taking hold with people.

15
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,410
When I had friends that were telling me
that the secret is real and that they

16
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:04,560
imagine they were going to fulfill
these childhood dreams that they had had

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,820
about whatever, being a fucking
astronaut, whatever, whatever it would be.

18
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,620
There's a couple people that I knew.

19
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,060
They were trying to tell me that the
secret was going to be the thing and that

20
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:17,550
they had a vision board
and they had photographs.

21
00:01:17,551 --> 00:01:21,360
They put pictures up of the things that
they want to like them in front of large

22
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:25,600
crowds and shit. And I'm like,
Oh boy, this is large crowds.

23
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,470
It's just so not how it works.
Yeah.

24
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,790
But there is a kernel of it that works.
Yup.

25
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,970
Cause it was thinking you wanting
something, you envisioning it,

26
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,540
but that's a little component
and just how you live your life.

27
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,510
It's not just sitting in your,
you know what it's like and wishing it.

28
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:47,511
So it's like saying I am going to be
a bodybuilder because I drink water.

29
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,360
Yeah. It's like no, you okay. Geez.

30
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:55,700
Where do I start?
You,

31
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:59,970
you should drink water and it will help
you if you want to be a bodybuilder.

32
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,000
But I've talked to all these bodybuilders
and the one thing they have in common

33
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:05,580
is they all drank water and they
knew that if they drank water,

34
00:02:05,581 --> 00:02:09,960
they would be giant. There'd
be giant, huge people. It's
all you've got to go. Okay.

35
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:13,590
But did they also perform reps to failure?

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,270
Did they also take steroids?
Did they also do these exercises?

37
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:23,160
Squats, dead lifts, curls, you know,
did they do all that stuff too? Yes,

38
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:25,850
but that but the water,
why aren't you a believer?

39
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,190
This is what it's like cause cause
they're saying like no, these people,

40
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,500
they believe that they can
do these things. They they,

41
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:37,350
they had this vision and they focus on
this vision and it came to fruition. Yeah.

42
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,610
You know what they also did?

43
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,710
They also busted their fucking ass and
got lucky and we're in a business or

44
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:48,711
career that they had some talent in
and figured out what that career is and

45
00:02:49,651 --> 00:02:54,651
figured out how to navigate the very
weird waters of social interaction and

46
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,440
skill acquisition and success and failure
and learn from your failure and luck.

47
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,200
Yeah. That's the big problem is
you're dealing with complete. Yeah.

48
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,470
At sampling bias, you're, you're only
asking people that are in the mansions.

49
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,980
Tom Papa, how did you do
it? I mean I see you here.

50
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:17,200
You have this place. It's as big as
the White House. You have a giant lawn.

51
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:20,230
Did Judge Joe always know this
was going to be your reality.

52
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,840
I saw it and I just put
it on my vision board

53
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,730
and the obviously it doesn't stick around.

54
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:30,640
It'd be didn't it became a
fad because all these people,

55
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,950
well at some point that's
take the board down.

56
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,230
Fortunately some people died because they,
um,

57
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,360
there was a story I was reading about
Oprah unfortunately where this woman had

58
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,290
terminal cancer and she,

59
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:49,830
she had stage three breast cancer and
just decided that through the secret she

60
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:53,760
was going to imagine herself
a healthy person and you know,

61
00:03:53,761 --> 00:03:56,820
she eventually want them dying from it
because she, she didn't get treatment.

62
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,240
The IAA,
I mean she,

63
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,880
she stopped that she stopped
conventional medical training.

64
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,880
But what part of,

65
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:11,680
so how far do you go
with positive thinking?

66
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,990
Cause I see you as a fella that,
uh,

67
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:19,300
has goals and I would think positive
thinking plays into your life.

68
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,050
What does that even mean? Really?
Like do I think pauses? I, I,

69
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,810
I think in a positive way.
I try to be positive.

70
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,590
I try, but when you're trying
to accomplish something,

71
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,210
whether you're trying to, you
know, get better at something,

72
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:40,420
like say if you're playing a game,
like what if you like golf,

73
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,660
like say take up golf and you
want to be a really good golfer.

74
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,930
Like you start thinking about golf,
like how do I get better at golf?

75
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:51,430
You have to learn, you have to pay
attention to a instructional videos.

76
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:55,780
You have to maybe seek out coaching,
you have to play some games and lose,

77
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:58,930
you have to choke under pressure.
You have to examine the mental game.

78
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,710
Like what is wrong with my mental
process when I approach a shot?

79
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:06,660
What is wrong with this? What
is wrong with it? And then
become obsessed with the,

80
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,370
the idea of succeeding in that.

81
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,760
And I think that that can
apply to everything. So yeah,

82
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:16,060
I mean I certainly believe
in positive thinking,

83
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,360
but that was like mystic nonsense.
No,

84
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:23,630
that tips over and it discounts all
the other stuff that you have to do

85
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,550
something to the law of attraction.
It is,

86
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:31,570
but it is one component to this gigantic
sort of spectrum of factors that have

87
00:05:36,441 --> 00:05:39,510
to be taken into consideration when you're
trying to succeed at something. Yeah.

88
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,230
Positive thinking is one of them,

89
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,670
but it's also the understanding
of how to eliminate laziness,

90
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,420
how to discipline yourself, how
to write down goals, how to,

91
00:05:50,421 --> 00:05:53,390
how to make incremental
steps towards improvement,

92
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,990
how to recognize failure is not
just the end of all your hard,

93
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:01,670
but in fact the beginning of
a new breakthrough because
you understand like how

94
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:04,310
to never do this wrong, wrong
the wrong way again. Yeah,

95
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,170
and the consequences
of doing things wrong.

96
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:10,940
It's like there's a lot of
a lot of factors in getting
better and succeeding at

97
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:14,900
things. Yeah, and it's, they
boiled it down to the easiest one,

98
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,210
which is dreaming. Right,
right. Exactly. Exactly. Just,

99
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:23,420
just that's why it's sold, but
oversold it. I mean, she was, yeah,

100
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,600
she was one of the big
ones, man. And she was in,

101
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,100
she was fucking 50 years old at the time.
I mean,

102
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:31,700
this is not a young woman who was
selling this. How old is open now?

103
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,990
75 89 no,

104
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,710
she just ran a marathon in
four hours. Did she? Really?

105
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,250
67 63 so she ran a marathon.
Yeah.

106
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:47,570
So let's,
let's think of when the secret came out.

107
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,210
I want to say that was like 2006 ish.

108
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:55,190
2004 2006 okay,
so 12 years ago she was,

109
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:56,780
so she was 50 years old.

110
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:01,640
How the fuck did you not know when you're
50 years old and worth $1 billion that

111
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:05,630
that's not how it works. But it's Hocus
pocus. Yeah. It's not hocus pocus. Yeah,

112
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,200
and to sell that to people is crazy.

113
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,300
And that's a book that's sold.

114
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,110
I think I was reading it's soul somewhere
in the neighborhood of 20 million

115
00:07:15,111 --> 00:07:18,980
copies. Wow. Is that what it says?
Yeah. Jeez, that's crazy. Well,

116
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:22,550
you want an easy way. You want
something that's easy. Everybody wants,

117
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:26,540
you're in trouble, you're feeling
whatever and they want something to come.

118
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:29,330
Something come and help me.
I mean it's where religion comes from.

119
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:32,990
It's just please, there's that
thing inside of us is like, ah,

120
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:37,730
I want to believe if I believe, is that
enough? It is a lot like that. Yeah.

121
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,710
There was one of Trump's
spiritual advisors was, uh,

122
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,650
he's got some spiritual
advisors, some woman who was, uh,

123
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:49,020
telling people to send her money.
There was a set,

124
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:53,510
send her money for January. There was
some, so some whole article about it,

125
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,620
but it's basically essentially the
same thing. It's like the idea is that,

126
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,230
what is she saying?
Donald Trump's spiritual advisor.

127
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:05,231
Paula white suggest people send her
there January salary or face consequences

128
00:08:05,271 --> 00:08:07,760
from God. No. Is that true?

129
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,190
She's attractive too. Is Interesting.
Is that true? Yeah. Look at our Pam,

130
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,880
I'll give you money. What do I gotta do?
All right. I'll you what I do, Paula,

131
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,490
how much do you need?
I don't know if that's a good picture.

132
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,070
Maybe she just looks cool when
she's screaming. Yeah, she
looks good. But, um, yeah,

133
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,850
I would love for some,
really,

134
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:30,650
I would love for the day where there's
some real powerful spiritual, uh,

135
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,890
individual who doesn't ask for money.
You will. That's fine. Who doesn't? Who?

136
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:39,920
Real power. Powerful or spiritual
individual. It's a huckster.

137
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,193
That's what I mean.

138
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,740
[inaudible].
