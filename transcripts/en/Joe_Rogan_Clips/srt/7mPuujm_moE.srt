1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,370
When you did retire and when
you retired in the rain?

2
00:00:02,371 --> 00:00:06,240
That was the most honest retirement speech
I've ever heard of box of give ever.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,583
He's just like,
I don't,

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:12,020
I don't have this in me medium
and swimming in there anymore. Um,

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,480
I looked pretty bizarre
for myself. Yeah. No,

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,010
cause this is what I base my life on
doing. I, when I first started doing it,

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,210
I'm a dedicate my life to this stuff.
He gets to see that it's not even,

8
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,420
there's no longer that
happened was pretty weird.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,600
When did you know that you
didn't want to do it anymore?

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,860
I'm known years before that, but I
was still being very successful. Yeah.

11
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,270
Like when like what year?

12
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:35,290
Like do you remember around when
he started thinking it? I remember

13
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,310
probably when I,
what the 2000 area.

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,750
So by the time that's post Holyfield yeah,

15
00:00:44,751 --> 00:00:49,540
after and you, you're just, you it done
too much. I was just winning. I'm winning.

16
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:54,080
Beating guys. You know, guys get hit or
something and from gotta be feel scared.

17
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,370
Yeah. What did, what did you have in mind?
Like that's the hardest thing right? To,

18
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:02,940
to swing from that to the next thing.
Like how do you take,

19
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,920
how do you take this crazy exciting
life? No, I thought I lifted.

20
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,460
Let me if get high for a while and
figured it out. That was the plan.

21
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,580
Yeah. I mean party for a while
to figure this stuff out.

22
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:20,450
What did you figure out? Okay. Um,
uh, I wanted to do other things.

23
00:01:20,451 --> 00:01:21,950
So I started my wife,
um,

24
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,970
arranged for me to be the
death being on stage that the,

25
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,730
she created the show.
Yeah.

26
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,510
That's a brilliant idea because you're
also the first fighter that ever did that.

27
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:37,170
Cause many fighters have great stories,
but very few of them we've ever,

28
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:40,870
I don't think anybody besides you
was ever put it in the did it man.

29
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:45,560
It's just amazing. We did in Monaco,
we didn't own, we did it, um,

30
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,650
uh,
uh,

31
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,710
amount of various places and now I can't
believe that people want to see this

32
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:53,470
though. Well like I said,
the documentary was amazing.

33
00:01:53,471 --> 00:01:57,250
So people want to hear the live version
of you talking about it and the see you

34
00:01:57,251 --> 00:02:00,100
live in person.
Cause the first time we did it,

35
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,840
the first time we did it, I'm
on Broadway Day, day three,

36
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,540
we were really as sure about
how it's gonna turn out.

37
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,670
So we invited all of our friends.
We had taken the,

38
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:14,360
gave all to our friends and people we
love like names and we pulled them to the

39
00:02:14,361 --> 00:02:18,020
show. And so when we started they
started laughing. Everybody, if I left,

40
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:20,270
I ran in my right wife around.
I still got the baby.

41
00:02:20,271 --> 00:02:24,280
What's going on and listening. Okay.
I didn't want the show to be a comedy.

42
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,930
They turned out to your comment with hard,
gritty show about a tough guy. Right.

43
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:30,140
He made it through his toughness
and he just came up on me.

44
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:32,240
He was talking about myself,
how much a smoke I am, you know,

45
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,850
and they loved it. Well I think that was
part of it. It's cause like they all,

46
00:02:39,851 --> 00:02:42,130
everybody knew you were this tough guy,

47
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,540
but they didn't know that you can be so
self deprecating and have so much fun

48
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,290
with it all. You know? That's
why people loved it. Yeah.

49
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,360
They're doing the writing for my moving
and stuff. I haven't seen anything,

50
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:55,540
but it's going to be pretty wow.

51
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,500
Who's playing you in a movie
on the various people you know?

52
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:04,240
Most likely when Jamie, Jamie,
Jamie Foxx to do it. He could do it.

53
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,400
He could do anything.
He could do anything.

54
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,130
That guy could be the fucking president.
United States.

55
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:11,500
He could be a pilot that goes to the moon.

56
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,900
He could do whatever the fuck you
want. Want him to do it. Yeah,

57
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,770
he could do whatever he wants. He'll
probably bulk up like crazy too to do it.

58
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,490
It's going to be really, wow.
Yeah. Jamie could pull it off.

59
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,790
Michael Jai white pulled it off. Michael
Jai White didn't do it like Jamie. I,

60
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,000
I dunno. I thought it didn't do a bag.
A lot of people that make what he did,

61
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:34,780
but I thought you did a good job. He, I
loved him and spawn. He's a great guy.

62
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,170
Do you know him well? No. He's a
great guy. Great Guy. Very smart guy.

63
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,420
Very humble guy.
Really,

64
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:43,510
really intelligent and a great
martial artists to Michael Jai White.

65
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,200
It was a kill Kachin a karate
black belt is bad when the fight,

66
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:50,740
the fight in the UFC. Now when he was
fighting, there was no UFC around,

67
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:53,680
but he did a lot of karate
tournaments and stuff. It's very good.

68
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,420
I watched him train before. He's legit.
Very legit. But like I said, real,

69
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:02,920
real good guy. But yeah, I
agree. Jamie Foxx, man. Jamie
Foxx is on another planet.

70
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,280
He's just got this level of competence
and skill and artistry in his singing and

71
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:13,120
his comedy and his acting. He
could do anything. He could play.

72
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:15,340
You just going to hang
out with you for awhile.

73
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,400
I don't know what he's gotta
he's gotta hang out with you.

74
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,970
So be pretty awesome. He's got to hang out
with you got to absorb it, right? Yeah.

75
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,880
To see what, how that works out. Are
you going to be the kiss consultant?

76
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,030
You're going to be like pitch. I would
never said that. I would like to say that.

77
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:31,864
Yeah.

78
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,190
But for some reason they just, um, they
have their Hollywood ways of doing thing.

79
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,890
Yeah. You know what I mean? They make
it come out of Hollywood ish, I guess.

80
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,600
Cause some think that it's just,
it's just really wild.

81
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:51,300
How did they try to switch it
to appear? Um, cause Annabelle,

82
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,600
right? Yeah. They tried to change the
story and no one else I realized too,

83
00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:00,550
when Hollywood perspective from things,
the religious is just still unbelievable.

84
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,820
Yeah. So it's really, it's unbelievable.
