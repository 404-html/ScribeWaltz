1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,160
Right? Here's one that people had an
issue with w and one thing you could say.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,780
Okay. Um, like, uh, when Kathy Griffin
held up the, the, the Trump head,

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,730
remember that? Um, did she do that
on her own Twitter account? Uh, yeah.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,020
She, yeah, she, well, I mean she
posted a photo of it, which she posted.

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,690
She posted an Instagram,
Twitter, I think it was on both.

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,940
I'm not a hundred percent
sure. Right. So that it's,

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,440
is it allowed?

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,630
It's allowed because it's newsworthy
because it's a celebrity and the celebrity

9
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:38,631
is threatening a public figure who is
also the most powerful person in the

10
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:41,460
world. So it's okay.
It's that why that is,

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,320
I think she posted it because it was an
art piece that was kind of controversial.

12
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,600
Oh, no, no, I know that.
And that's what I'm saying.

13
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:50,340
Why they're saying why is it okay,

14
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,930
why is she still allowed to be on the
platform? And Alex Jones case kicked off.

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,030
That's a, it's an
interesting question, right?

16
00:00:57,031 --> 00:00:59,130
Like what do you need
to do to get kicked off?

17
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,430
Because that's not the only thing
that Kathy has done, um, recently.

18
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:06,180
She was one of the people that was calling
for the name for that young boy who

19
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:10,890
was, um, with that native American in
front of his face beating the drum. She's,

20
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:12,410
it's crazy, irresponsible. You know?

21
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,640
I'm sure she feels bad
about it now in retrospect,

22
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:17,700
especially if she's watched the video,
but she got carried away and she thought,

23
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:19,110
what we all thought when
you saw the picture,

24
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,680
there's smirking cunt of a kid that got
in the face of this beautiful indigenous

25
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:27,000
man is singing, is his rain dance
cry. Whatever the fuck is doing. Yeah.

26
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,020
That's not what it was though.
We,

27
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,090
we found out afterwards it was much
more complicated. What is their song?

28
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:37,360
What were they saying? It sounded
cool. They should make a record. Yeah.

29
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,410
Do you like that shit? That shit's
cool to listen to when you work out.

30
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,880
If you could get like some,
some legit native American chance,

31
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:47,160
like that puts you into a trance,
right?

32
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,400
If you don't know what they're saying
and you'd just go running and you listen

33
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:54,330
to that. Take a little
couple Tokes, go for,

34
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,990
go for a jog in the woods, listening to
native American chance on your airpods.

35
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,750
Ooh, that was an interesting
video though, because I mean,

36
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,350
I was a one 80 after just hearing
the second side of the story,

37
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:09,180
like 12 hours later, people still were
calling for that guy's head. Yeah.

38
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:13,650
And people, I saw someone who said,
um, what's his name? Ron Perlman?

39
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,570
No, who's the guy who was a Hellboy?
Yeah, Ron Perlman. Ron Perlman was like,

40
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,050
motherfuckers are telling me that,
uh, I'm not seeing what I'm seeing.

41
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,180
And she said something about some white
prick or white motherfucker. I'm like,

42
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,890
oh, okay. People try so hard. Like you,

43
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:33,720
you are seeing what you're seeing. Yeah.
You're seeing what you're saying. Well,

44
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:38,580
you're not seeing is a video that
shows how it occurred. It's all it is.

45
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:43,080
Yeah. You know? So why is that
okay? Right. Why is that okay?

46
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,440
Why is it okay for some journalists to
say horrible things about white people?

47
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,500
Why is that okay? Why is
that okay? It seems weird.

48
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,060
What if it encourages violence against
a innocent white person? Just one.

49
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,850
Should you be responsible? What if
they say, why did you do that? Well,

50
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:04,270
I read Blah Blah, blahs a tweet
and I was like, you know what,

51
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:07,210
I am going to go out and punch
a white person. Fuck that.

52
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,880
I just found some white
old lady not beat her ass.

53
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,750
Like if someone decides that you're not
responsible for that. All right. Yeah,

54
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,823
probably not.

55
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:19,240
But you kind of kind of feel like you
played a part in the way people look at

56
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:24,130
things, especially people that are
very easily influenced, you know?

57
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,180
It's just also, it's gross.
He read something really
racist against white people.

58
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:31,540
They like, that's gross. Like you
think all all people. I like that.

59
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,600
A whole group of people that don't
have as much melanin, they're all shit.

60
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,810
That's ridiculous.
You're ridiculous person.

61
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:42,130
I don't care if you're brown or black or
yellow, you're ridiculous. That's silly.

62
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,870
It's we have to decide

63
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:50,390
to get to decide like what the fuck
we're doing and we keep letting illogical

64
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,590
behavior be normal.

65
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:58,540
Like breaking us off into fucking groups
like that and thinking that, you know,

66
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:02,530
all men are great, or all women or
gray or all gays or grade and every,

67
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,400
all straight cisgendered man can go
fuck themselves. All right, that's,

68
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:10,810
that's silly talk. I don't care who
you are. You're not allowed to do that.

69
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,780
But we let people do that.
If they're a part of a marginalized class,

70
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,040
if someone's a part of a marginalized
class, then you get to shit on everybody.

71
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,910
In a weird way, you get to like
reinforce racism. It's really,

72
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,150
it's so fucking counterproductive too,
because if you do that,

73
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:27,680
then it just makes people just
get defensive on the other side.

74
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,730
They don't even want to even think
or empathize with how you are.
