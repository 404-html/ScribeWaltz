1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,490
And, uh, I, I feel like
there's a fundamental,

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,230
fundamental problem with the way
people approach ideas. And, uh,

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,450
I think it goes back to what we're talking
about earlier about right versus left

4
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:12,120
or Republican versus Democrat.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,320
They're not thinking of the
consequences of arguing for a,

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,400
against the possibility that
climate change is a human costing.

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,260
They're not thinking of the consequences.
They just want to win. Right. Right.

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,000
And want their side to be ready
to be right. And the, you know,

9
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:28,200
what bums me out is they don't understand
the consequences of that for the both

10
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:32,860
the American enterprise and
the human enterprise. Right?
I mean, because, you know,

11
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:37,710
uh, if you, if you keep calling
one branch of science a hoax,

12
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,190
then what's to say the other
branches like, well, you
know, then you just, you're,

13
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,220
you're rolling down this slippery slope
where like the other countries, you know,

14
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:45,480
like,
so most of the,

15
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:49,770
of the Nobel Prizes Americans have
one where people from other countries,

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,520
they came here to do their science because
we had the best scientific enterprise.

17
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,870
The next generation, we'll
just go somewhere else. I'll
go to China. You know, so,

18
00:00:57,871 --> 00:01:01,410
um, there's that part of it. And the other
point it's like, dude, it's just science.

19
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:05,010
It doesn't care about your
political views and you know,

20
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:09,210
it's not fair to use the cell phone
and take the antibiotics and then turn

21
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:09,961
around and like,

22
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:12,780
and then suddenly treat this thing as if
it was another thing in your bucket of,

23
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:13,920
you know,
ideologies.

24
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,240
I think also people think if you
somehow or another compromise industry's

25
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:20,130
ability to,
to work,

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,000
that you're going to kill jobs and you're
going to damage the economy and that's

27
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,910
more important. Yeah. But I think
it's the exact opposite. Right?

28
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:31,080
And if people really saw it,
right, I mean, um, you know,
again, just like I'm saying,

29
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,640
climate change shows how
powerful people become.

30
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:38,130
It also shows how powerful
are our enterprise. Right?
We did this by, you know,

31
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:41,130
building businesses by
building enterprise by,

32
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,990
and we built this world girdling machine
of civilization and it, you know,

33
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,380
the planet actually noticed.
Why do you like that term world?

34
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:53,520
Girdling because that's, it gives
me the EXEC girdle wrapping around.

35
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:58,740
It's because it's from like a Shakespeare,
like from a Caesar or something.

36
00:01:58,741 --> 00:02:01,620
I always thought it was good, but it's
the idea that like, you know, in, um,

37
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,600
the foundation trilogy, the
Isaac Azman Off, you know,

38
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:06,910
classic science fiction
thing, then there's the city
of the planet of Transport,

39
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,650
which is the center of the,
uh, the empire, the collected
empire. And it's, you know,

40
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:13,710
it's basically the whole planet.
It's been covered in city, you know,

41
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:14,530
like the other,
that planet,

42
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,690
you got to go down like 500 levels before
you get to the surface. So that idea,

43
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:20,790
you know, I mean, what I like about
it is the idea that like, you know,

44
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:25,050
we've done something, we're kind of
covered the planet in our, our effect,

45
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,180
you know,
covered the planet in our enterprise.

46
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,910
So this issue of business is that like,
um,

47
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,070
there's a place I can stand in Rochester.

48
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:34,290
I did this for NPR and
there's the Erie Canal.

49
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,290
I can stand right on the edge of the
Erie Canal. Then there's a train tracks.

50
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,960
The tracks was laid,
those tracks were laid back and you know,

51
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:43,950
the original line back in
the 18th whatever seventies
then there's a highway and

52
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:47,250
then there's the airport right over there,
four different infrastructures,

53
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,550
you know, which he, everyone took
huge amounts of money to build,

54
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,160
one of which we don't even use anymore.
Right. So the idea of building an a, an a,

55
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,180
an infrastructure that will,

56
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,280
that will not be carbon polluting will
not trigger climate change. Like did it,

57
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:01,850
this is what we do.
You know.

58
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,840
So the idea that there's gotta be
more jobs that come out of this,

59
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:06,860
then it could ever come out
of fossil fuels. You know,

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,770
it's not a big deal for human beings
because that's what we do to switch

61
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,430
infrastructures and there will be a lot
of wealth generated up by, you know,

62
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,370
just like there was when we
switched to the trains, you know,

63
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:20,290
where's the argument coming that we owe?

64
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,440
Because there are people that
just adopt the, the party line,

65
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,790
the party line that climate's always
changed and human beings barely affected.

66
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,970
And it's not something to concentrate
on. Where's that coming from? Again,

67
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:35,440
I think it's the, you know, the gradual
political polo polarization of everything,

68
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,280
you know, cause you look at, in the,
um, we're now at the, uh, what is it,

69
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:42,640
30 year anniversary of Jim
Hanson, who was, you know,

70
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:45,670
the famous climate scientist giving his
testimony in front of Congress in 1988

71
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:48,850
on a hot, sweltering summer day. We said,
climate change is already happening,

72
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,640
you know,
and that made news everywhere.

73
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,130
And that was the first like public
awakening that this was happening.

74
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:56,440
And if you look at the first Bush
administration, they were like, oh yeah,

75
00:03:56,441 --> 00:03:59,530
we're ready to do something about
this year. We can do it, you know? Um,

76
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,420
and then it just gradually over time,

77
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:04,740
as the whole political polarization thing
happened, you can actually see the, uh,

78
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,270
the, the very purposeful denial, right?

79
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:10,300
They took a page out of the cigarette
companies yeah. For years, right.

80
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:12,220
The cigarettes were like, oh, if I,
cigarette companies are like, no,

81
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:14,840
it's not a problem. So they
were purposefully, you know,

82
00:04:14,841 --> 00:04:17,850
there were people had money invested,
right. You know, like didn't of,

83
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,100
this is a documentary that
that goes into that, um,

84
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,820
w what is the name of that merchants
of doubt. Merchants of doubt.

85
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,270
That's a great book, man.
That's a really good book. Yeah,

86
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,040
the documentary is really good too.
So it was purposeful,

87
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,210
but it's also confusing.
It's like why are they doing that?

88
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,620
Like who's paying them to do that?

89
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:40,621
Obviously the cigarette companies would
be paying the same people to put doubt

90
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,230
into the idea that cigarettes are
addictive or cigarettes cause cancer.

91
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:46,060
And this is what had
been done in the past.

92
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,140
Now the same people are involved in doing
it with climate change. Right. But why?

93
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,610
Uh, well, you know,

94
00:04:51,611 --> 00:04:55,210
at one time I wrote a piece for the NPR
that was kind of positive about like,

95
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,920
hey, we can switch infrastructure
is like I'm saying.

96
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,210
And some guy wrote me back very angry and
he said, you know, the proven reserves,

97
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:05,050
you know, the stuff, the oil
that's in the ground has a wealth,

98
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,970
has a valve monetary
value. Like they, you know,

99
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:09,670
that's in there in the oil
companies, banks, you know, the,

100
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,020
in their bank accounts of one point $5
trillion. And like I said, dude, you know,

101
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:18,340
people have gone to war for a lot less
than one point $5 trillion. So you know,

102
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,630
if we were to really be like, hey
man, we can't burn that, you know,

103
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,930
you're gonna have to
leave that in the ground.

104
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,860
That's like through their bank
accounts going like zero pretty fast.

105
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:30,640
So what I don't, so it's those
industries. I think that's part of it.

106
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:31,181
And then it gets,

107
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:35,440
you get linked to other things and then
it becomes this sort of like mass, uh,

108
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:36,670
you know,
becomes the political poll.

109
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,230
They use the political
polarization to sort of, you know,

110
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,560
sort of make this happen.
It doesn't happen.

111
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,360
You look at other countries aren't
doing this right. That's the one thing,

112
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,240
you know, other countries, there's always
a little bit of climate denial going on,

113
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:48,250
but we're like the only country
that's guys you can see.

114
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:51,190
Cause we're the only ones who are
not part of the Paris accord. Well,

115
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:53,470
it's one of the weirdest things
about this right left things.

116
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:55,830
The left is always supporting
the environment. The,

117
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,070
the left is all about the environment.
The left

118
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,910
is about clean air and clean water. And
how did that happen? I don't understand.

119
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:04,370
I don't understand that either.
The whole thing is very strange.

120
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,540
Well, I got, you know, I mean,
I have issues with, you know,

121
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:11,330
environmental lists too because, um, I
think one of your shows I was watching,

122
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,310
you know, the whole idea of
Eco Bros, right? And you can
eco brode by people. And I,

123
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,730
so I have a piece in the New
York Times today, an op Ed,

124
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,490
where I'm basically saying like, look
man, the planet is going to be fine. Like,

125
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:20,570
you know,
long term,

126
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,450
there's nothing we can throw at the
biosphere that it's going to kill it.

127
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:25,070
We're in. It's not about
saving the planet, the Earth.

128
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:27,200
He's not a fuzzy little bunny.
You know,

129
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,080
the planet is powerful and
it's really about saving us.

130
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:31,430
Let's be honest about what's going on.

131
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:34,070
And there's gonna be all kinds of ethical
choices that go on that, you know,

132
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:37,730
the polar bears may not be able to come
along with us on the ride here. You know,

133
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,810
we need a healthy biosphere with, you
know, a lot of biodiversity, but you know,

134
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:43,550
we're part of it and we're
going to have an impact.

135
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:45,450
There's no such thing as no impact.
And you know,

136
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,500
already I'm getting ECO brode
people are like, you just, you know,

137
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:51,550
you don't care about life. Yeah. What
about I just like, oh, come on man.

138
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,800
I just put it in the thing I said we need
to be wise and compassionate, you know?

139
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:55,634
But they're like no

140
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,900
convenient opinions.
I mean this is,

141
00:06:57,901 --> 00:07:02,880
this is one of the things you get
involved with when you start talking with

142
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,740
people about really important issues.
I mean,

143
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,450
it's like we were talking about
earlier, they want to be right. Yeah.

144
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,950
And they want to be on the
side. It's righteous and with
virtue and ethics. Right,

145
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,920
right. And they find anything that
you disagree, they disagree with it.

146
00:07:16,921 --> 00:07:19,650
You're saying they don't ask
you questions, they don't go.

147
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:21,960
What do you think the implications are?
Like how do you,

148
00:07:21,961 --> 00:07:26,040
how do we minimize the effects and the
negative consequences of are they just

149
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:30,870
immediately want to say, you are
insensitive. You are an asshole.

150
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,400
You are the problem.
Yeah.

151
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,720
You didn't know my way around that.

152
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:35,670
And that's what the whole
book is about is to like,

153
00:07:35,671 --> 00:07:37,680
when you've got a
polarization, right? You know,

154
00:07:37,681 --> 00:07:39,420
where you know you're
either this or you're that.

155
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,570
The thing that this is like a mathematical
idea is to go orthogonal. You know,

156
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,780
when you, when you, you know,
you go, cause you know, it's
a line basically, right?

157
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,110
Either on this side or that side go 90
degrees to it and now you're in a whole

158
00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:52,300
new space. Now you're up and
down to the left and right.
