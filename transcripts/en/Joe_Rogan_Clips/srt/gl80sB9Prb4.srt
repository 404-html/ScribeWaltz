1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Yes.
It pulls out a man got married.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,640
Wait, when is a fighter going
to come out with a, I mean,

3
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:11,400
is there ever been a time where you
get more shit for liking the president?

4
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:15,480
Never even close. Not even close. I mean,

5
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:18,720
at the very least,
even if you didn't want him to win,

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,340
now that he's the president, would you
not want him to succeed? What do you want?

7
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,410
Why He, if he succeeds,
it means we succeed.

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,740
You want everything to be a catastrophic
failure because your guy didn't win,

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,570
or do you want him to get better at the
job and be really good at what he does

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,040
and be the best president that he can
be and pull a bunch of shit they do in

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,250
North Korea? What's up with that? Maybe
he did. I mean, maybe he was a part of it.

12
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,870
We're both North Korea and South Korea
giving Donald Trump all the credit.

13
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,710
That's amazing. If that's true,
that's amazing on CNN. He,

14
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,720
that alone shows you that his unorthodox
style that you might be terrible if

15
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:57,180
you're married to them or terrible if
you're doing business with them are

16
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:59,160
terrible if you're as
lawyer or terrible whatever,

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,970
but that unorthodox style
might have value to it,

18
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:07,020
but no one wants that value because you
don't want him to win because it's a

19
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:09,000
fucking weird time. It's like Joe, Rudi.

20
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,140
It's almost like you're rooting against
America because you feel so strongly

21
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:15,870
about the present. Like to your
point, would your rather have him out?

22
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,720
You want the economy, you
better. Here's the other thing.

23
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,190
You want Mike Pence to be president.

24
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,640
Are you sure you don't
know what you just said?

25
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,840
You don't know what you're saying
like that is not a smart choice.

26
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:27,120
That's not what you have voted for.
It's not what you want.

27
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,630
What you should want is even
if you don't like Donald Trump,

28
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:34,200
what you should want is that
he does a great fucking job.

29
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,220
He turns the economy around.
He goes after child pedophiles.

30
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,790
He goes after like whatever,
whatever, fill in the blanks,

31
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,410
whatever thing you would like them to do.

32
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,330
Even if he talks crazy shit about and
it gets on Fox and friends and says a

33
00:01:48,331 --> 00:01:49,170
bunch of nutty shit,

34
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:53,850
wouldn't you still want that guy to
do the best job running the country?

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,330
This is where things get weird cause I
think most people say no. I think in,

36
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,870
if they say yes, they're lying what
they want and they want them to fail,

37
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,840
they want them to be the worst
ever because they watched.
That's what they want.

38
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,230
That's what they want. It's a flaw.
That's a crazy way of thinking.

39
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,360
But I didn't vote for Donald Trump,

40
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:13,830
but I want him to do great because
he's the fucking president.

41
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,690
Like either someone else comes along
that's better and wins and takes over.

42
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:19,524
Or why would I,

43
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,670
why would I want everything to go bad
even if I didn't vote for so retarded?

44
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,710
Everybody, if you had a doctor,
this is a good example, not not me,

45
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:31,410
but maybe it sucks, but if you had a
doctor and the doctor was a Dickhead,

46
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,600
the doctor's fucking annoying,
but he had to fix your knee.

47
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,280
But you know he's the best at fixing
knees. Like this guy's a dick at.

48
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:39,450
I hope he fucked my knee up.

49
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,640
You never say that.

50
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:47,680
It's only hurting you is the only guy
who can do this operation for anything.

51
00:02:47,681 --> 00:02:49,830
You got to listen to me.
I know the guy's an asshole.

52
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,160
Let him operate on your knees. Going to
do a great job. He's going to talk shit.

53
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,920
He's going to try to fuck your mom,
but he's going to do his job.
