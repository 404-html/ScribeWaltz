1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,790
That's out to Wiz Wiz, Wiz
Khalifa, cousin Bri. Yeah.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:08,250
Shouts out the breeze breeze got into
Jiu Jitsu and it's brought whizz into it

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,000
and it's now shamed me into going to, so
at some point I want to pop up in a gym.

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,480
I got to get you and Joey Diaz and a
Jujitsu class would be the greatest.

5
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:17,950
I've got to get this stuff.
The shoulder I to finish rehabbing Cara,

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,820
it's going to clear me when I don't know
what your shoulder rotator cuff surgery

7
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:24,990
on both shoulders. Jesus. Yeah, but I can
do this again now. Okay. Yeah, I can grab,

8
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:28,060
but I can't think got you're doing
those elastic bands. You'll exercise.

9
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:32,610
Got those in the room. Did those this
morning. Wiz put on a ton of muscle. Doug,

10
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:36,570
there's a photo of him pre and
post and it's truly impressed.

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,720
I would not want to fuck with Wiz
Khalifa right now. He's not just a thin,

12
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:43,550
tall kid rapping. He is. He is ridiculous.

13
00:00:43,551 --> 00:00:46,950
I will give you kicks and take your bitch
at this point. Have you seen his abs?

14
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,540
They're wood. There's huge like, look
at that. Look at it. They're not just,

15
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,520
they're not just ripped,

16
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,900
I'm going to stop slobber and soon they're
not just rip their big like look how

17
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:02,460
much power advantage of going from
skinny to big though versus me.

18
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,360
Why this time times a muscle under here
but got to lose a lot of Chubby to see

19
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:09,990
it baby,
your legs carrying around all that weight.

20
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,750
I always thought if someone could
lose weight once they're really heavy,

21
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:14,310
they would have an
advantage of their legs.

22
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:17,550
Calves are still good but the legs are
constantly used to moving around with

23
00:01:17,551 --> 00:01:19,740
much more weight and now all of a
sudden they don't have that way.

24
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,840
It's like you've been backpack training
like any of the difference. Well that's,

25
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,820
that's not as good a difference. It's
hard to tell them. No big difference.

26
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:30,130
Still a difference then for sure.
Which was a great human being.

27
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,370
He goes to that a place
in um, in Hollywood, um,

28
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,860
Jay's place performance. Uh,

29
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,870
what is it called?
Unbreakable. The places,

30
00:01:42,871 --> 00:01:47,100
the shit supposedly it's like a semi
private place and you go in there like

31
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:50,280
chuck Liddell's working out and that
makes sense cause we is like really rich.

32
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,710
Yeah. Yeah. Like at least you're
getting the black community.

33
00:01:52,711 --> 00:01:56,220
He's like white people rich as
well. We call it white. He's on,

34
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,610
he's on a very high level right
now. God bless. I like with,

35
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,480
well if you did that to your body,
that dude works hard while I'm doing it.

36
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:07,290
I'm doing it slower. I need to pick up
the pace and go full 90 days like you say,

37
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:11,070
but I feel a lot better. I just did
a fucking Zappos running commercial.

38
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:13,560
I felt like the king of the
world. Did you? Yeah. Yeah.

39
00:02:13,561 --> 00:02:15,390
I mean I've been working out.
Miss shouts out to Al Clay,

40
00:02:15,391 --> 00:02:19,020
barred from play more fit effects
now former professional bodybuilder.

41
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,050
Just teach me how to retrain my brain
and when I'm not being lazy and really on

42
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:24,660
it feel great sweat today
so you don't regret the day.

43
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,330
The good thing about it
too is with a guy like you,

44
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,810
if you continue and you continue
to lose weight and get healthier,

45
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:32,960
you're going to inspire other
people to do the same thing. Eh?

46
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,590
People that are your fans
that go, fuck man, I've now,

47
00:02:35,591 --> 00:02:37,020
I want to get my shit together.
Yeah.

48
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:40,500
Cause what you don't want to do is get
rich dad. Have some young Wiz Khalifa,

49
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:44,760
like I fucking on your wife. That's
my daily mantra. That's a good,

50
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,390
I got a hot red hair wife and I
don't want to die all my money.

51
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:51,090
Go to some young Steadman light.
God fucking honor.
