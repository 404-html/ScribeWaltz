1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,490
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,350
So what is the corporation
about the corporations?

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:11,370
The story of the Cuban American organized
crime organization that began in the

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,540
mid 1960s and existed all the
way to the end of the century.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,860
And it was led by this mobster
named Jose Miguel battle,

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,130
who was kind of a legendary figure in
Cuban American circles because he was a

7
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:27,300
hero from the Bay of Pigs invasion,

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,560
the a and the attempt to
reclaim Cuba take back Cuba,

9
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,510
the invasion, 1961 which was a
disaster for everyone involved,

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,840
battle wound up in prison along
with the rest of the brigade.

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,560
And when he got out and came back to the
u s he was determined to get Castro and

12
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:48,390
take back Cuba.

13
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,030
So he set up this criminal thing
and it was based on a one racket,

14
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,240
primarily Bolita the number,
the lottery,

15
00:00:57,241 --> 00:01:01,290
the illegal lottery for the lottery
was illegal. It was illegal,

16
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:04,950
and it was controlled by organized crime.
And it was a huge moneymaker,

17
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,790
big moneymaker for the mob. Going back
to the 1920s everyone bets the number,

18
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:14,010
a little old ladies, but the
number of priests, cops, you know,

19
00:01:14,011 --> 00:01:15,900
you can bet a nickel,
you can bet a dime.

20
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,140
You can bet $10,000 hugely profitable
for whoever controls and organizes it.

21
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:25,740
Well the Cubans controlled and organized
it on the eastern coast of the United

22
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,430
States from New Jersey and New
York all the way down to Miami.

23
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:34,470
And the guy who controlled it was battle
and he became legendary based on that.

24
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,980
They controlled the whole number system.

25
00:01:36,981 --> 00:01:39,390
Cause I know there's a lot of
Italians that were, well they went,

26
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,800
they went to the Mafia.

27
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,080
One of the first things battle did battle
had been a cop of vice cop in Havana

28
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:49,890
in the 1950s during the,
for the turnover. Yeah,

29
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:52,710
during the era when the mob of Joey
was talking about Havana Nocturne.

30
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,940
That's what that book was about.

31
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:58,941
The era of the mob in a van in the
fifties Meyer Lansky Santo traffic content

32
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:04,191
and how they controlled that until Castro
came along and spoiled the party and

33
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:07,680
the revolution happened and they
got chased out of their battle.

34
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:12,420
Had been a vice cop in Havana during
those years and he knew all those uh,

35
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,980
high ranking mobsters.

36
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:18,981
And in fact he was a bag man who delivered
money from the Skimm at the casinos

37
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:22,320
in Havana to the presidential palace.

38
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,730
So battle knew how the world went
round and he made those connections.

39
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:29,880
And when he finally gets to the U
S and wants to start his own thing,

40
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,990
first thing he does is go to
Santo traffic. Content says,

41
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,640
can you make the proper
introductions from me?

42
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:41,010
Profit content introduces him to fat Tony
Salerno in New York City who controls

43
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,300
the numbers are accurate for all
five families. And battle says, look,

44
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,960
things are changing in Cuba
over the next couple of decades.

45
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:51,030
You're going to have tens of thousands,

46
00:02:51,031 --> 00:02:54,480
if not hundreds of thousands of Cubans
coming to live in the United States.

47
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:00,070
They all bet the number. That's a huge
market. If you let me take over this

48
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,860
thing and organize it,
you will get a piece of,

49
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,220
you will get your piece of everything.
And the Mafia said yes.

50
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,270
And so the Cubans took over
and they control everything.

51
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:13,480
I mean in New York City in
the seventies and eighties,

52
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,750
there were probably 200 to 300 Belita
spots where you could go bet the number.

53
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:23,200
That's what the Cubans called the
Bolita, a little ball. And uh,

54
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,440
so they controlled it and they took care
of the mafia and everybody was got fat

55
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:32,680
and happy, uh, for awhile until it turned
bad and they started killing each other.

56
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,840
Now when Joey,
when you heard about this book,

57
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,200
this is something that you
were very intimately involved
in when you were a kid.

58
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,071
Very,
you know,

59
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:42,760
I come on your show and I'll tell you
there's a hundred stories I could tell you

60
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,540
there's a thousand I can.
And when he told,

61
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:50,800
when I read the thesis for this book,
I just knew,

62
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,290
I just fucking know.
You know,

63
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:57,040
I grew up in numbers when I went to
Catholic school on of, and I'm like,

64
00:03:57,041 --> 00:04:01,030
I came home on Fridays and
Saturdays at the age of Eight,

65
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,720
I was sent to different locations
in the city, the Bronx, Brooklyn,

66
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,530
and I would make $50 going to run errands,
run the numbers.

67
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,520
They'll tell this guy the first
number of the day is to, you know,

68
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,600
so I grew up in it.

69
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:17,950
I grew up in a house where the bookie
would call my mother by three o'clock and

70
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:19,750
go,
what's the numbers for the day?

71
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:23,710
And My mother would give him a fucking
laundry list, you know? And uh,

72
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,710
it's very interesting in this book,
He also covers

73
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,000
the mysticism of the number.

74
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,710
So if I'm at your house and your daughter
walks in with a hockey shirt and a

75
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,540
number is 13, I'll look
at you and go, Joe,

76
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:42,530
give me a number from zero to
nine five and I pick up the phone.

77
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,750
I bet five 13.

78
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:48,220
If I look out my window and
the cop car is five Oh six,

79
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,690
I put $5 on five oh six.
If I have a dream about an eagle,

80
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,640
when I go down to the Bolita spot, there's
books that they sell books or dreams.

81
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,440
And I take that book and I look up Eagle.
And if eagles number eight,

82
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,890
I pay eight 13. It's, you know,

83
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:09,640
you were mentioning a couple months
ago that your grandmother took numbers.

84
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,780
Grandmother was Sicilian.
Sicilian people have the same,

85
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,890
uh, every day they live. Today's the day.

86
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,870
Today's the day Joe Rogan. Yup.
I, the day I'm hitting the number,

87
00:05:21,871 --> 00:05:26,530
I'm not getting you. She talked about
that dream. That dream would. Again,

88
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:31,510
we're going back on immigrant mentality,
those street numbers today. If God wants,

89
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,720
if God is real well,
he says it's true.

90
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,750
My number's gonna to come
out to that one is my ship.

91
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:42,700
Got to come in that work. You work
a plain Jane Dream. You wrote,

92
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,720
you were a blue collar person and I'm
the way home every day. By three 30,

93
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:51,190
you put the number and that's it.
That's what you do and to believe in.

94
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,790
That's something I can
relieve. Yeah. Numerology.

95
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,220
And with Cubans, uh, it was very

96
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,480
mystical.
It was tied into a dreams and belief.

97
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,670
The idea was you bet the number and
you try to make your dreams come true.

98
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,370
That's literally what you're doing. You're
trying to make your dreams come true.

99
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,660
And the bullied the guys, the bully
terros the ones who control it there,

100
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:17,870
the dream makers, they're the
guys who are making it possible.

101
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:21,500
For your dreams to come true.
So they had tremendous stature in the

102
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,770
Munich minimum,
every dream Saba.

103
00:06:23,771 --> 00:06:28,771
So you work the tjs Jose Battle
and you're an independent bookie.

104
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,390
Your job is to sit at,

105
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:37,230
at bring the lounge and Westlink 10th to
three drinking and all day long people

106
00:06:37,781 --> 00:06:41,290
come in and go, Joe gimme, five 17 $3,

107
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:45,490
give me three Oh three one doll at three
o'clock, three 30 a number comes up.

108
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,010
If that number wins, if I can give
you 500 you get 3000 from battle,

109
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:56,380
you give me 2,500 so you make 500
off the top. And then I tip. Yet,

110
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,550
the thing that battled did
was he didn't take 10 points.

111
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,380
He let you run your independent
action unless you called it in to him.

112
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,360
You know, it's very, you're
watched the movie, uh, uh,

113
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:15,690
what smooth Mickey Rourke and the
these people, you're the dragon.

114
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,240
That fucking movie, great
movie. When he says, you know,

115
00:07:19,241 --> 00:07:22,480
for years the Chinese will bring it into
heroin and they were sending it to the

116
00:07:22,481 --> 00:07:25,430
Italians, you know, a $50,000 investment.

117
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:30,450
It can make you $500,000 Chinese weren't
saying that like they weren't seeing

118
00:07:31,421 --> 00:07:34,180
that. Why? Because they didn't
have, they couldn't bring it out.

119
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:38,860
They couldn't sell it. Black people and
Spanish people bitch slap them to that,

120
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,460
so the same thing
happened with Bolita fat.

121
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:45,850
Tony Salerno knew that he had a
big thing coming with the Cubans.

122
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,470
The Cubans want to put a
better with Cubans. Yeah,

123
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,380
they understand the Italians. They want
to put a bet on where the Italians,

124
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,410
Puerto Ricans, they want to put a
better than with a Puerto Rican.

125
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,140
It's not a big thing.
That was with the numbers.

126
00:07:58,141 --> 00:07:59,460
It was that there was a community thing.

127
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:03,120
It's a community that actually would
talk about the numbers and be like the

128
00:08:03,121 --> 00:08:08,040
lottery is some sort of a government
funded gang and it seems like it's got a

129
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:11,160
lot of red tape and official
and there's no wiggle room.

130
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,450
The numbers seem to be
closer to like the community,

131
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,150
especially with Latinos, especially
with [inaudible]. It was the,

132
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,600
in some ways the core of the community,

133
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,570
the number of spots where
everybody would hang out.

134
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:28,150
You'd go to hear the
neighborhood Lobola in like the,

135
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,480
the gossip and the streets. He'd go there
and here in the neighborhood, guys up.

136
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:36,570
Uh, yeah, it was an end. It
was never meant to be violent.

137
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,590
Back in Cuba. Belita was
not violent. It was illegal,

138
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,620
but it wasn't violent and it turned very
violent than you in the United States

139
00:08:45,661 --> 00:08:49,170
to corporation became so profitable.
I mean,

140
00:08:49,171 --> 00:08:53,010
we're talking about millions
of dollars on a monthly basis,

141
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,790
billions of dollars over course
of the life of this organization.

142
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,310
Billions of dollars more than they could.

143
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,010
The artist thing they had was what to
do with the money. I mean, they, they,

144
00:09:03,011 --> 00:09:08,011
they would literally strap money to people
to as money couriers to try to get it

145
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:13,200
out of the country to get it into
getting into offshore bank accounts and

146
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:13,981
launder the money.

147
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:16,710
They had more money than they know
it was a license to print money,

148
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,950
which hugely profitable.
That's what made it violence.

149
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,180
Then you started having
gangsters vying for territory,

150
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:29,100
territorial disputes, greed, greed
took over and it got very ugly.

151
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,550
And there was this, this
between Cubans, between Cubans,

152
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:35,220
between the Cubans and the Italians.
See,

153
00:09:35,221 --> 00:09:40,200
this guy battle was very
charismatic leader, uh,

154
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,200
with some great leadership qualities.

155
00:09:43,201 --> 00:09:48,120
He'd been a hero in the Bay of Pigs
invasion. He saved some guys lives. Um,

156
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,880
when I first heard that
story, I didn't, I said,

157
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:55,350
I got to verify that maybe this is
just the story I told about himself to

158
00:09:55,351 --> 00:09:56,850
burnish his legend.

159
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,120
So I found the guys that he
saved and I found the guys,

160
00:10:02,281 --> 00:10:06,390
two brothers who went with him to
save that the guys that he saved.

161
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,090
And I went to Cuba,
to the Bay of pigs,

162
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:14,390
to the exact location where he saved
these guys to verify this story.

163
00:10:14,671 --> 00:10:19,320
And it was absolutely true. He, in
a, an act of incredible heroism.

164
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,800
He saved the life of a number
of his platoon members.

165
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,660
And so that was his reputation. From
then on, he was revered in the community.

166
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:31,370
He was a hero and people
defended him even, even when it,

167
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,000
it turned ugly and he became a ruthless
boss who was killing people left and

168
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:40,950
right. He had his defenders because of
his legend as a hero in the community.

169
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:46,380
And so, um, the power that
he had. But he also had this,

170
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:47,214
uh,

171
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:52,470
Joey and I were talking about this
tube and tab this Latinos have this,

172
00:10:52,471 --> 00:10:53,340
everybody has it,

173
00:10:53,341 --> 00:10:57,780
but Cubans have it a desire for revenge.

174
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,460
This guy,
you know,

175
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,870
the Bay of Pigs invasion was an attempt
that revenge to get revenge against

176
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,930
Castro.
And they were humiliated by that process.

177
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,320
And a lot of the guys from that generation
had an unfinished agenda for revenge.

178
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:17,640
So if you wrong this guy battle in
any way, he was going to get you,

179
00:11:17,641 --> 00:11:20,280
even if it took years and
years of calculation. I mean,

180
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:24,300
there's stories in the book about this
one guy who killed his brother named

181
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:25,950
Pilou.
He took,

182
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:30,980
it took nine years and 12 attempts
before they finally killed this guy,

183
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:33,840
Paul Lula. They shot him in his
hospital. He was in the hospital.

184
00:11:33,841 --> 00:11:37,770
They shot him how to assassinate dressed
up as a male nurse and go into the

185
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:41,640
hospital and shoot him between the eyes
because there had been so many failed

186
00:11:41,641 --> 00:11:46,140
attempts, they weren't going to fail this
time. And that's in battle to 12 years.

187
00:11:46,141 --> 00:11:50,010
I mean, took nine years. His awesome.
No, never caught him. No, no way.

188
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,000
Bank disappeared.

189
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:56,200
I believe the assassin got killed later
cause he was talking about it having

190
00:11:56,201 --> 00:12:00,510
done it and so battle had him
killed. Wow. Yeah. So the,

191
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:04,090
the revenge motive,
the revenge motive, um,

192
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,800
kind of trove battle off the deep end.
And uh,

193
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,070
somewhere along the line he
broke bad, so to speak. I mean,

194
00:12:12,071 --> 00:12:14,590
I don't know if he was ever
good and had to break bad,

195
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,530
but he started doing internal killings.

196
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:21,310
It really had nothing to do
about business. They were
all about revenge. Well,

197
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,790
this is a theme that happens a lot
with organized crime people. Right?

198
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,580
It's like they just get a taste of
killing people and it becomes easier and

199
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:30,880
easier. And then they, that was the
thing about murder machine, right?

200
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,000
About Roy Demeo, right?
Yeah. You just can't,

201
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,970
was killing people and
nothing to it after awhile.

202
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,520
And that's another book you gave me.
Yeah.

203
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,020
I was reading all those books on the road.

204
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:51,360
Okay.
Okay.
