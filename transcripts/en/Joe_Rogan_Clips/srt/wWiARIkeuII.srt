1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,590
Five four,
three,

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,540
two law and with luck due
a bright to the dark side.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,600
Now you playing quick. I
got my ass whooped. Yeah.

4
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:16,330
Well you were in a fucking melee. There's
three other dudes and they're blasting.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,770
It's a one on one map that maps chaos.
This is so fun though.

6
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:23,280
How Fun is that Shit? It reminds me of
golden eye. Do you ever get into that?

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,430
How dare you? First of all,
64 that's a great game.

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,770
That came can suck all the dicks.

9
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:33,660
You using those stupid x-box things
lets you control a mouse and keyboard.

10
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:35,640
It's where you're at.
That's why you get fucked up.

11
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:38,250
You don't even know how to move.
It was hard for me to move back and forth.

12
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,670
If it was the controller game on
what? Yeah, cause nobody can move.

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,120
Nobody can move. Then you're all
right with control this and did that.

14
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:49,560
Fucking that games chaos.

15
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:53,100
Jamie and I've been going back and
forth for fucking four or five days now.

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,100
You'd be surprised. There are a
couple of guys that can compete.

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,310
A few that can compete with the mouse
and keyboard. I wouldn't be surprised.

18
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:00,061
I'm sure that Ken,

19
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:03,300
but they have zero life and they don't
even know what a pussy looks like.

20
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:10,650
The quickest quakes old score, right?
Yeah. Cool. We're on quick for,

21
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,460
but this quake champions that you play
online. We've been playing quake for,

22
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,160
because we could set it up on what's
called a local area network, a lan,

23
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:19,350
and it's real easy and there's no latency.

24
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,630
It's just direct from
computer to computer.

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,730
It's fun to this thing
on the one guy he there.

26
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,510
He's really aggressive workout dude.
What's that? The guy that I'm thinking of,

27
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,450
he's a, he's a video video can
play a very good, he's really good.

28
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,150
He hasn't named Nick Marks. I'm
only, I'm sure he gets pussy.

29
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,930
There's some good looking dude. Yeah,
I'm sure there are. I'm sure there are,

30
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:40,500
but it's not fun to say no. It's fun
to say that they weighed four pounds.

31
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:43,020
You'd like to picture Miss Jazz.
Yeah, they can't find their deck,

32
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,610
but now those kids and get hot shit.

33
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,320
There's even hot chicks who
play video games. Oh yeah.

34
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,860
Well it's a good move for hot chick.
Like there's,

35
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,440
there's hot chicks than hunt because
like in they wear makeup and shit,

36
00:01:55,441 --> 00:01:58,910
full eyelashes and shed because
it brings them into that world.

37
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:02,160
And then all the guys were hooligan
hers. She loves what? Oh look.

38
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,553
Yeah.

39
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,000
It was like stand in front of like
endangered species with their tits out.

40
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,220
Like there's hot girls to
take Moitai class. Right.

41
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:13,950
And they get all serious angry face.
Don't talk to anybody.

42
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,780
Pretend they're real fighters. Some of
them are real, some of them are not.

43
00:02:18,781 --> 00:02:23,430
Though. Some of them get super serious.
That's when I whisper like this. Yeah.

44
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,380
When they say, I don't like when people
say, I'm going, I'm going to train today.

45
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,360
I'm like, well what are you doing?
He'd taken [inaudible] training.

46
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,261
That's not training.

47
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:38,550
We trained for what we'll do training
for the talk lips to be training for some

48
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:39,384
deck.

49
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,600
His God damn games,
they're so addictive.

50
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,020
You word like straight up
addicted to them, right? Oh
yeah. I had a real problem.

51
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,150
Well, I kind of got a
little bit of a problem now.

52
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,510
Jamie and I have been talking back and
forth. He's up on me a little bit too.

53
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,570
That's why I have to kick Jeff out every
now and then just with Jamie and I go

54
00:02:57,571 --> 00:03:01,840
one on one.
One last time I fucked him up and he hit,

55
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,420
he quit cause me and Jeff are easy prey,
right?

56
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,950
Like you can just not easy prey anymore.
Jeff was easy prey for a little bit.

57
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,210
If I want all these games, how long do you
think we'd be here playing quake? True.

58
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,910
You want to get you one.
All these keys to competitive,

59
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:19,600
you wouldn't say and you lost 13 to
five because you were trying real hard.

60
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,750
You got fucked up son.
I let you up and talking change.

61
00:03:23,751 --> 00:03:27,910
You were talking shit and he
says, yeah, sure. Fucked him up.

62
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,910
The problem with having another person
in in the thing is he always goes after

63
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:36,820
Jeff first. He said, easy kill.
That's what he comes and gets me.

64
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,140
I can barely get my fucking be quiet.
Yes, are killing me right away.
