1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,800
The joe rogan experience. Whose idea was
this for this show? That was my idea.

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,400
Jesus Christ. Dude,
you're an unusual human.

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,050
It's fun though. And how many
of these episodes have you done?

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,980
We have finished six. And you're going
to that, is that the entire season?

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,570
Yeah, that'll be season one comes out in
July. You excited about it? Yeah, I'm,

6
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,430
I'm pumped. So 50% of the time
you almost died. Yeah. Yeah.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,110
I mean that's a gross math
around it around. Okay.

8
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:35,130
So there's the water one. Well you almost
froze to death. Yup. That definitely.

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,480
And then the avalanche one
will you lasted 30 minutes.

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,450
What was the other one? Oh Man. Oh Man.
Yeah, of worse. Yeah. I mean it was,

11
00:00:44,451 --> 00:00:47,350
it was, it was less pleasant. Um,

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,480
like I was a bull fighter for an episodes
out dude and not a bull rider because

13
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,410
they're insane. But the bull fighter
is the guy that's on the ground.

14
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,790
So when the bull fighter gets thrown,
he's the bodyguard for the bull rider.

15
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,610
His only job is to take the hit.

16
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,070
So the bowl writer doesn't get trampled
to death because the moment the bull

17
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:11,480
rider comes off the Bulls back,

18
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:15,290
the bowl is turning around to
crush whatever was on its back.

19
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,740
And that's where the bullfighter runs into
save him. And uh, you know, the, the PBR,

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,850
the professional bull riders association,
um,

21
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,050
those guys are the most selfless,

22
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,940
courageous guys trying to protect
those bullfighters um, bull riders.

23
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,050
So I trained for a while and I was,

24
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:41,000
went to the biggest rodeo in
the nation and was bull fighter.

25
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:45,650
And um, I mean this isn't one of those
shows where people don't get hurt.

26
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,960
You're like, you see the inside of my
body, you see people get really, really,

27
00:01:50,961 --> 00:01:54,290
really jacked up and go to the hospital
and like he does he have a punctured

28
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:56,720
lung? Is that guy going to live? Um,

29
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,520
this is that type of show cause there's
no other way to do it. The only thing,

30
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:05,030
the only direction we had from
discovery was don't fake anything.

31
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,780
That's a great direction.
That's great direction. I'm
glad they came up with that.

32
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:14,000
Now what happened with
the bowl? Um, well I,

33
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:19,350
I got owned, which is humiliating
because they're not really smart animals.

34
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,140
You're fast over there.
Jamie's a wizard. Yeah.

35
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:27,640
I like to encourage all little boys and
girls that follow me on any social media

36
00:02:27,641 --> 00:02:30,760
platform to stay in school,
become engineers, architects,

37
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:35,350
accountants are anything that doesn't
lead to permanent brain damage or need of

38
00:02:35,351 --> 00:02:36,370
an orthopedic surgeon.

39
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,200
It's you legs up and a bowl
watching you through the air.

40
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,980
That was the training week.

41
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,400
So this was when you were
trying to distract the bowl.

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,820
What kind of techniques
do you use? Uh, football,

43
00:02:54,821 --> 00:02:59,821
running back stuff just juke them one
way and the is you actually have to sell

44
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:04,180
that body movement.
So like your weight,

45
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:08,860
half your weight has to shift far
enough where the bowl is going to really

46
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:11,630
believe that you're going
to go to that direction. Um,

47
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:16,950
I wish bowls were so I wish they are
dumber than they are because they're not,

48
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,410
cause if you fake them once one direction,

49
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:24,940
they won't take it the next time they'll,
they'll you try to fake to the right.

50
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,890
They'll already start
going running to left.

51
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:29,560
So then you fake to the right and you go
back to the left and you're like, oh no,

52
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:35,020
I have done an, it's at that moment that
Tim realized he had fucked up. Yeah.

53
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:36,670
Then it just gets her own.
I got destroyed.

54
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:42,610
And so when you get launched through the
air by a bull, it's, it's, it's weird.

55
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,850
Um, because it's, it's
weightless, you know,

56
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:50,740
it's just a second and you
are completely inverted.

57
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,600
No control over where your body is going
because you didn't generate that energy.

58
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,410
Um,
but the other part of you,

59
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,110
the other part of your brain is knowing
that that bowl is going to try to turn

60
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:06,250
as fast as it can and get you
when you land on the ground.

61
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,970
Cause that's what it's really
good is when you're down. Yeah.

62
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:15,940
So you're trying to keep track of
where this bowl is while you're hurling

63
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,330
through the air. Like okay, I got to
Tuck my chin so I don't break my neck.

64
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,960
You know, hopefully I'm not close enough
to the fence. The fence doesn't move.

65
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:25,450
The fences metal,
the other ground is pretty soft.

66
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:27,970
I'd rather land on the ground
and then land on the fence.

67
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,160
The fence will mess you up anyways.
So that's anyways.

68
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,910
And how'd you get away from the ball?
I'm an athlete.

69
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,510
I'm not sure if you know
that. That's it. That's it.

70
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,920
Just athleticism. Yeah. Luck. Little luck.

71
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,960
The luck that you didn't get stomped.
No.

72
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,990
So there was some real bull fighters in
the ring with me that I think saved my

73
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:57,200
life every single time because I suck.
I at the end of this show,

74
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,440
people are going to look
at this and be like, one,

75
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:05,540
Tim is an idiot to everybody
that does this job.

76
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:10,330
These jobs has the biggest
balls and our show. Bad Ass.

77
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,570
Hopefully that's what
they're going to get.

78
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,520
Cause this isn't like a Tim Kenny
look cool show. This is, um,

79
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,750
that guy's an idiot and everybody else's,
it's that fucking picture.

80
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,670
Oh my God. Oh my God. Look
at that picture. Notice that.

81
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:29,170
That's a different bowl. So you
said this more than once. So this,

82
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,000
this bolt is,

83
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,360
he's got his feet up in the air and his
head is inches from you and it's about

84
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:42,430
to collide with you and there's no fucking
way you got away in their situation.

85
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:44,290
There's no way that thinks way too close.

86
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,840
What is it like to just
get a launched 2000 pound

87
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,870
fucking meat vehicle?

88
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:03,040
Okay.
