eve. A little man. He's sober right now.

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,210

Y'all doing sober? October. Wow.

9
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:40,500
Why did you ask me? I would've sobered up
for it. No. No, you wouldn't have done it.

10
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:42,850
No. I want to do, uh, get fucked up.

11
00:00:42,851 --> 00:00:47,070
I want to go to retox retired.

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,310
That's when my boyfriend, Johnny
calls it. It's time to retox.

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,000
How many cigarettes are you smoking
a day? No. Well No. Who's counting?

14
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,020
You just keep walking. I'm not smoking
less than 10 less than 10 it's not bad,

15
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,800
but I was smoking a lot.
See,

16
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:09,100
I'm cutting it by 10
every week. Oh, okay. So,

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,830
so next week it'll be down to one a day.

18
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,990
All Week. What days? Not Bad.
And I'll see how I deal with it.

19
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,510
If anyone dies.
Okay.

20
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,550
This whole thing has been
completely fucking insane. And you,

21
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,070
yeah,
and I don't have to tell you,

22
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,220
but you caught this madness is
outrage culture right at the peak.

23
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,520
I think you, you hit peak
outreach culture. Thank you. Well,

24
00:01:38,521 --> 00:01:43,280
people didn't give a fuck if
you were making a joke, get,

25
00:01:43,281 --> 00:01:46,080
didn't give a fuck. Have you had
no idea that that lady was black?

26
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,960
Didn't give a fuck what
your mental state was.

27
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:50,850
Didn't give a fuck if you were on Ambien,

28
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,860
didn't give a fuck if you were drinking.

29
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,840
Didn't give a fuck if you
sincerely apologized. Oh,
go ahead. I do want to talk.

30
00:01:57,841 --> 00:02:00,630
Don't pick that. Did, but
they didn't care that you,

31
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,890
you sincerely apologized and did not,
didn't mean to offend.

32
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,610
You were cracking a joke about it.
Woman

33
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,810
it,
it was funny how they've missed,

34
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:14,210
characterize it and lied about
it and added words to it.

35
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,210
But, um, yeah, I like talk
about the tweet, but uh, yeah,

36
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:24,220
I seriously apologize to all who might
inadvertently offended and because they

37
00:02:26,991 --> 00:02:28,410
were offended for like it,

38
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,450
it wasn't even what they say they were
offended cause it didn't say that,

39
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,400
but they think that I tweeted
a said she looked like, uh,

40
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,580
you know, somebody and I never
said anything about her looks,

41
00:02:40,581 --> 00:02:44,410
it was a political tweet and
it's just proof of how um,

42
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,560
everybody's under mass mind
control because they took a, um,

43
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,850
and of course I'm always
interested in that. You know,

44
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,760
you know that I've talked to,
yeah,

45
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,970
that's what I think people are under
the wave of self imposed mind control.

46
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,960
I don't think it's like there's anybody
pulling the strings you can get out of

47
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:07,940
it. No, I don't think anyone's pulling
the strings. I don't think this is a dead,

48
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,940
no, I don't, I don't think it's by design.

49
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,930
I think people were caught up in a
wave of fear and paranoia and political

50
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:14,610
correctness.

51
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,920
And I think one of the reasons why attack
they attack someone like you is first

52
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:20,620
of all,
you're wealthy and successful and famous.

53
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,340
You are beautiful and one of
the best comics of all time.

54
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,300
And you're also, uh, you're,

55
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:32,140
you're an easy target.
You're a white woman.

56
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,430
As a white woman,
what do you identify as?

57
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,080
I identify as a Jew. Well, there you go.

58
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,880
And this is what you thought this woman
was as well. What is my cousin Sharon?

59
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:47,920
She looks just like my cousin,

60
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,450
but it wasn't nothing to do with how
she looks that came after my tweet,

61
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:57,570
but the next blessing it about the
planet of the apes of her hands.

62
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,490
What she engineered in Iran.
And I had been on there talking about the,

63
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,250
the,

64
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:08,250
I call it a woman's revolution in Iran
for years and speaking to people in Iran

65
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:13,430
and bout it and what it means to,
uh,

66
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:18,160
the women who are second
class citizens there.

67
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,020
And uh,

68
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:27,200
so if you take that one tweet out of
like probably I tweet a lot. Yeah, I was,

69
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:31,220
I was traveling 400,000.
No, I don't go crazy.

70
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:35,990
I stay crazy. I admit it. I mean,
what the fuck? They're like,

71
00:04:35,991 --> 00:04:40,220
you know what you've said you're crazy
for years and you know what? You're crazy.

72
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,400
Well, yeah, I said it
for fucking years. Well,

73
00:04:43,401 --> 00:04:47,930
it's also one of the reasons was our
crazy, all comics are fucking nutso.

74
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:52,210
At least I don't wash my keys like some,
I know some guys they had,

75
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:56,690
they got to wash their keys five, six,
seven times where they can go on stage.

76
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,620
What's his name? Oh, I'm so
bad on names. Chris Farley.

77
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:06,140
I always ask comics, you know, I ask
him what's, what's your secret number?

78
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,590
Which years Joe number.
You don't have a number.

79
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,880
You don't have to do something a number
of times. You don't have a number.

80
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:18,560
What's your birthday?
Eight 1167 eight what's that?

81
00:05:18,561 --> 00:05:23,561
August eight 1167.

82
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,900
You were born in 1967. Yes. Jesus.

83
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,160
F Christ. Um, I was in the, my,

84
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,660
I was in the Utah State Hospital.
When you were born,

85
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,590
what were you doing given birth?
No, I was in a mental institution.

86
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,930
That was my first hospitalization.

87
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:50,710
It lasted for nine months and it was the
Utah State Hospital in Provo where the

88
00:05:52,191 --> 00:05:56,450
Osmonds are from.
So it was always a big Marie Osmond Fan.

89
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,100
The,
the mental

90
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,100
health aspect of this conversation is an
important one because here's my take on

91
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,510
this. Extremely important.
It is important.

92
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,180
And yesterday was mental health
awareness day. Yes, I know.

93
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:10,840
And I was quite aware
of being mentally help.

94
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:13,940
The yesterday as I was smoking,

95
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,160
if someone has, all I eat
is cheese. If someone has a,

96
00:06:20,161 --> 00:06:24,980
an injured leg, you don't expect them
to run marathons. If someone has a,

97
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,440
you know,
something wrong with their liver,

98
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,620
you don't expect an a processed food
correctly. You don't blame it on them.

99
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,740
But if someone has a mental health issue
and they do something erratic, yeah.

100
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,220
Or they say something that's inappropriate
and then they apologize for it.

101
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,670
Or if they're a comedian or
if they're comedian and you,

102
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:46,910
you've had the jit imit Breal diagnosed,

103
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,570
treated mental health issues,
trauma related issues.

104
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,100
There you go. How'd do you like
that? It's a little, I can do that.

105
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,860
Help you do better Kenya.
Yeah. But for whatever reason,

106
00:06:59,861 --> 00:07:04,861
people want to pretend that this is a
deliberate act by a calculating person who

107
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,280
is just being an asshole. And that's
not the case. You're not an asshole.

108
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:15,280
Not at this time. I have been an asshole
when you weren't here, but you weren't,

109
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,370
that's not what you were
doing. No, I was talking about

110
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:22,540
about Iran and the woman's
revolution there and how, uh, how,

111
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,270
and it's always been
because you know what?

112
00:07:25,271 --> 00:07:30,271
I had my DNA done cause I wanted to
know and I am of North African ancestry.

113
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:36,310
How much, um, it's like
a very small percentage,

114
00:07:36,311 --> 00:07:40,810
but it was something like 25,000 years
ago, they left, um, north Africa,

115
00:07:40,811 --> 00:07:43,820
which is kind of Syria.
And um,

116
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:47,410
they went to Lithuania and um,

117
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:52,060
Russia and uh,
some Europe,

118
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,520
July 23 and me or something
like that. Yeah. Yeah.

119
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,820
And it just answered so many
questions for, you know,

120
00:07:57,821 --> 00:08:02,560
why I feel this yearning towards that
part of the world. But I do, you know,

121
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:05,350
and especially the geopolitics,
there are some,

122
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:10,351
it always intrigued me and I have
always attempted to use my voice to um,

123
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,920
you know,
support all,

124
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:20,890
all the people there.
Well it's a fascinating,

125
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:25,210
so it was, you know, this one
tweet was about, it was about,

126
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,870
I mean it's actually a genius tweet if
you really fucking know. What did you say?

127
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,290
What exactly did you say to
let's find the tweet, Jamie,

128
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:41,490
I'll tell you if it's, the artificially
rendered is an artificially rendered one.

129
00:08:41,491 --> 00:08:45,350
Yeah, there's a lot of them. Were
people distorted what you actually yeah,

130
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:49,830
at first it was racist Roseanne and
then about a couple weeks later it was

131
00:08:49,831 --> 00:08:53,340
disgraced comic Roseanne
and her racist tweet.

132
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:58,370
And then after that it was disgraced
comic and her offensive racist tweet.

133
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,510
Cause there's all these hoops
you gotta jump through, you know,

134
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,240
they're never done punishing.

135
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:11,241
You were saying before that all my
friends said don't apologize to social

136
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,550
justice warriors because
that's the kiss of death.

137
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:17,640
That's fucking chum in the water.
Blood in the water, you know,

138
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,020
is definitely a little bit of that.

139
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:22,860
But what I was saying before the podcast
to you is I don't, I don't really,

140
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,610
what I really think happens is they find
a target and they don't care if it's a

141
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:29,300
viable target,
but once the target gets greenlit,

142
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,270
they go after you until
some new target comes along.

143
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:38,280
Until someone distraction the
target and its recreational outrage,

144
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:39,031
they find me,

145
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:43,050
they attack you and they go after
you and try to distort your position,

146
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:47,820
the fuck you said. And obviously they
don't. That's what kind of cracks me up.

147
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,350
It's like,
look at this,

148
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:53,220
look what they're saying it meant and
you know I'm not going to bow down before

149
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:57,780
them and say you were right and they
want me to, but they weren't right.

150
00:09:57,781 --> 00:10:01,920
I'm right. I wrote it bitch,
so I know what I meant.

151
00:10:01,921 --> 00:10:05,840
So you don't get to tell me what I
meant, but they don't care. It's just,

152
00:10:05,841 --> 00:10:07,980
the thing is they don't want to
look at it rationally and say,

153
00:10:07,981 --> 00:10:10,980
well here's a woman that has a
history of mental health problems.

154
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:12,690
She was on Ambien and drinking.

155
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,380
And she says something that
is slightly irrational,

156
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,870
but given your explanation of it,

157
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,540
Doug both always think all
my tweets make no sense.

158
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:28,080
You've been saying that for a fucking
year since I went on Twitter. You're like,

159
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,220
her tweets are just buttons, straight
up crazy, crazy tweets for sure.

160
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,940
I don't think they're crazy.
You just don't get them.

161
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,990
Well maybe if I was in the same
mindset as you, I would get them. Yeah.

162
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,530
But obviously no one had,
when I say crazy,

163
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,110
I don't think like other people.

164
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,190
I know that I've always known that my
whole life I had always test other people

165
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:54,200
to see what they were thinking. Like
as even as a kid, I'd be like in bed,

166
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:58,630
I tried to fit in, they go, let's play
barbies. You know? And I'm like, fucking,

167
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,440
I don't want to, I'm like, okay, well,

168
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:06,260
but let's have Barbie be a resistance
fighter that paratroops into, um,

169
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:10,890
you know, into the hidden lines of the
German thing and save all the Jews.

170
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,310
And they'd go,
you have to be her cousins skipper.

171
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,100
And then they'd hand me the skipper doll.

172
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,970
I always had to personify skipper
and they got to be Barbie.

173
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,670
I didn't even know a bar. We
had a cousin. Yes, skipper.

174
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,700
She has a little tiny tits and I resented
that because I always had very large

175
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,410
pendulous breasts since
I was four or five.

176
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:43,140
I did. I don't, I don't think or look
like other people. I am an alien.

177
00:11:43,141 --> 00:11:46,260
Really? What planet you
think you'd be from? Well,

178
00:11:46,261 --> 00:11:49,170
somebody told mass from [inaudible].
Do you know anything about that?

179
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,150
That's the people that call the art bell
show. They would always say that. Yeah.

180
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,560
That's what they say. Round faces are
fun. Play. Do you see you got around face.

181
00:11:56,561 --> 00:11:57,520
That's what I told you.

182
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:02,290
I don't even go by what people look like
except for I do look at the shape of

183
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:05,620
their head. I have to admit
that's how I classify people.

184
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:10,621
I classified people my own way cause I
don't think like everybody else thinks I

185
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:15,930
take a person shape of their head and
that's the group they represent to me.

186
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,530
And I have noticed that the
Dutch have the largest heads.

187
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:25,390
The Dutch have pure score.
Not all of them of course,

188
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,900
but some of them you're the
average height for a Dutch person,

189
00:12:28,901 --> 00:12:33,810
like six feet tall. I know the
women folks. Yeah. Vikings,

190
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,520
Vikings,
yeah.

191
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:40,750
I love all the different peoples of the
earth because they all have a variety of

192
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:44,350
foods that I enjoy. So
I like to, you know,

193
00:12:44,351 --> 00:12:46,540
I don't just mix with one kind of person.

194
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:50,830
In my real life I mixed with all
kinds of people and you know,

195
00:12:50,831 --> 00:12:54,880
cause I'll go anywhere for a
free meal. But I, but I love,

196
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:59,230
I love cultures and I love all people.
That's all I want to say. You know,

197
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,990
I would never,
I'm not that person.

198
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:06,340
You're not a racist by any stretch of
the imagination, but you are a person.

199
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,500
My sense that I'm a Misanthrope,

200
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,560
I'm a misanthrope misanthrope but I
am a respect truss of no man or woman.

201
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,440
But most comedians, yeah,
we're all like that, right?

202
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:22,810
Thropic intentions or you have
to hate all people the same,

203
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,300
but you definitely have
to mock and make them.

204
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,310
It's a part of the job description.
Yeah,

205
00:13:27,311 --> 00:13:29,400
you're done the mock
and make fun of and you,

206
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:33,390
you look for things that are irritating
about everything. No Shit right there.

207
00:13:33,391 --> 00:13:35,070
That's sort of the job.
None of that.

208
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,250
That was part of your
character on your show. Yeah.

209
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,250
It was part of the reason
why ABC wanted you bag.

210
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:43,060
It's part of the reason why the show
became such a giant hit and its return.

211
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,660
I mean it was a fucking huge hit
coming right out of the gate. Yep.

212
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:52,210
28 million people. That's a lot of fucking
panties is number one. Every episode.

213
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:52,781
Yeah.

214
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:57,781
That's a lot of people and a lot of that
was because people love this aspect of

215
00:13:58,661 --> 00:14:01,030
you,
but as soon as you get labeled a racist,

216
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,480
everybody throws their hands up and
goes, Whoa, I didn't know she was racist.

217
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:09,730
She's racist. And they don't care about
nuance. They don't care about the details.

218
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:12,130
They don't care about ambien.
They don't care about alcohol.

219
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,070
When I called you on the phone
was the first thing that I,

220
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,600
one thing I've learned Gel. Well, if
you're going to take an ambien down,

221
00:14:19,601 --> 00:14:22,000
not do not drink a beer.

222
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:26,230
Always only drink a wine with ambien.

223
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,870
I have a good friend of mine
who is one of the nicest,

224
00:14:28,871 --> 00:14:31,030
most respectful guys
you ever want to meet.

225
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,420
He woke up in Germany on a plane,

226
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:37,900
covered in his own vomit with the police,
standing over him,

227
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:41,770
asking him if he knew what happened.
He wound up getting arrested.

228
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:46,300
They brought him to the jail
in Germany and they add in the,

229
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,170
he's a CEO of a large company and they
went over things with him and they said,

230
00:14:51,171 --> 00:14:52,070
what happened?
What

231
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,210
do you remember? He goes, well,

232
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,660
I remember taking an Ambien and then
that I went to sleep and then I had,

233
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,440
I guess I had a beer at some point
in time and they go, okay, stop.

234
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,760
This is what happened.

235
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:06,560
And so they described how he was hitting
on the stewardesses and trying to start

236
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:08,280
fights with men.
That cabin and

237
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,460
wasn't as being as real selfie was on
Ambien. Yeah, I know. It starts thing.

238
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,000
He's the nicest guy.
If you knew this guy,

239
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:20,360
you would never in a million years
believe that he was capable of anything

240
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,070
remotely like this. And the German people
actually let him stay in the country.

241
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,770
They let them continue his
vacation. They're like, okay.

242
00:15:27,771 --> 00:15:29,900
For gave him promise not to do that again.
He goes,

243
00:15:29,901 --> 00:15:32,130
I'm never fucking taking that
shit again in my life. Yeah.

244
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,810
And one of the things that I said
to you when I called you up, I said,

245
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,400
what were you doing well and you told
me you are on Ambien. And I said, okay,

246
00:15:40,401 --> 00:15:43,760
we'll stop right there because I know
quite a bit about that because I've had

247
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:47,180
personal experiences with friends
that have had real issues with ambien.

248
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:51,020
I had a bid I did in my act about a
friend of mine who literally made a meal

249
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,670
while he was on Mbn. Yeah. Cooked at
the supermarket. What? God food. Yeah.

250
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,020
Cool.

251
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:00,180
Look at tiger woods that he was on that
and then you'd go driving off in the

252
00:16:00,181 --> 00:16:03,240
golf cart and to meet some check,
you know?

253
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,350
And that I don't understand where
people said they have sex on Ambien.

254
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,670
People say that's a big thing that
people take ambien to have sex.

255
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:15,510
I don't even know how they can stay on.
I guess they don't stay awake,

256
00:16:15,511 --> 00:16:19,530
but another part of them wakes
up and their sex part comes out.

257
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,860
That's all I can figure. I've never
taken it. I'm terrified of this.

258
00:16:22,861 --> 00:16:26,610
Don't ever take it. Yeah, I get, nope.
I have no problem going to sleep.

259
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:30,120
I've never had a plan to do,
but you know what I found is THC,

260
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:35,150
they sell it down at the dispensary
and there's one for sleep at night.

261
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:40,470
And um, I've been doing that and I, I've
been sleeping through the night, uh,

262
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:44,850
when I was taking the sleeping
thing to sleep and drug ambien,

263
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,450
while I don't want to say it because
we don't want to get sweet candy, man.

264
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:53,190
You don't want to say it three times. You
don't get sued. Not me. I say an Ambien.

265
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:58,110
I bet you they give a
fuck. They said, yeah. Did,

266
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,930
do you see that? Yeah. Well, you know,

267
00:17:00,931 --> 00:17:04,300
I had Hamilton Morris on the
podcast who was a drug expert. Yeah.

268
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:09,040
And he w he writes for vice and it does
a pieces for vice and he went and did a

269
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,100
piece for vice

270
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:15,730
incident. He came on and went
in great detail about how that,

271
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,660
that is something that
happens to people that, well,

272
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,580
they have no idea what the fuck they're
saying. It's called the hypnotic.

273
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,430
That is the classification
of drugs that it falls under.

274
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:28,120
And people do all sorts of involuntary
things when they're on there. No,

275
00:17:28,121 --> 00:17:30,340
it doesn't just make
you say racist things,

276
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:35,320
but you didn't say anything intentionally
racist. No. It's the way people decide.

277
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:35,890
Well,

278
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,260
about the work of Valerie Jarrett's hands.

279
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,350
And I also was referencing
my very favorite movie.

280
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:46,180
So if we could talk about how fucking
awesome that movie planet of the Apes,

281
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,930
great fucking movie. Also.
It's the definitive people, uh,

282
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:55,290
get your, come on people now
smile on your bird. It's like,

283
00:17:55,291 --> 00:18:00,040
come on. It's like the hundredth monkey.
Is that the thing? Is that the name of it?

284
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:05,420
That's what it is. The hundredth monkey
on the typewriter. They write a curls.

285
00:18:05,421 --> 00:18:09,740
Mckees what is it? How that work, that
if you have a certain amount of months,

286
00:18:09,741 --> 00:18:12,000
that hundredth monkey,
that changes everything.

287
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:16,830
If p f a f a species does
something 99 times in a row,

288
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:21,520
the hundredth time it's
gone into their DNA. Yeah.

289
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,290
And then they evolve to the next level.
Hundredth monkey effect.

290
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:29,740
I'm just effect is a
hypothetical phenomenon in
which new behavior ideas claimed

291
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,020
to spread rapidly by unexplained means
from one group to all related groups.

292
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,110
Once a critical number of members of
one group exhibit a new behavior or

293
00:18:37,111 --> 00:18:40,070
acknowledged the new idea.
Yeah.

294
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:45,470
Well the thing is a lot of people put
pictures of that woman right next to the

295
00:18:45,661 --> 00:18:50,460
lady. I understand the picture was
put up after my tweet. I understand,

296
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,800
but I am nothing to do with that picture.

297
00:18:52,801 --> 00:18:55,620
I didn't say she looked like
anything I wrote. Seriously.

298
00:18:55,621 --> 00:18:57,810
I'm not that fucking shallow.
Okay.

299
00:18:57,811 --> 00:19:02,640
I never talked about nobody's lugs unless
they're like thin and blonde and I'm

300
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:07,641
jealous but you know and
youthful now but or whatever.

301
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:13,310
But wasn't there another tweet that you
made a long time ago about who was that

302
00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:16,310
other woman? Susan Rice. Yes. Yeah.

303
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:20,490
Well you said she has giant swinging
eight balls that she's a man.

304
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,340
Let me explain that now.

305
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:27,090
Cause this is the regional
listic regionalism.

306
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,780
I'm from Utah and all the girls in Utah,

307
00:19:30,781 --> 00:19:35,340
when we got married and are, we heard
our moms do it too. It's always,

308
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,910
where's your ape? They go, what's
your age doing this Sunday?

309
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:43,380
And he's like, oh, he's watching football.
All good. Let's go out to lunch. You know,

310
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,930
it's all,
all of the men were all apes.

311
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:51,030
That's how it is in a breeder culture.
Like Salt Lake City, breeder culture.

312
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,590
Yeah. Culture. So it's
like, where's your ape?

313
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,730
And there's like, man, you're a peasant.
Big fucking swing and eight balls.

314
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:00,990
I give him that.
You know,

315
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,820
it's a regional lipstick thing and uh,
you know,

316
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,550
so I used it and apologize,
but yeah.
