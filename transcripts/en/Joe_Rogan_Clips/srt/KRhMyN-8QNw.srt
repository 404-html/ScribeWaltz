1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,450
Walt Disney's a nice man,
but Bambi was not a good thing for our,

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,360
our collective psyche around hunting,
not just Bambi,

3
00:00:06,361 --> 00:00:10,410
but essentially all cartoons involving
animals to animals. Where your friends,

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,980
yes. Even predators, like Yogi was
your friend. He was your friend.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:18,480
He wore a tie is a bear attack.
Um, and he had a hat on. Yeah,

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,550
he was at a picnic basket and wanted your
picnic. Jamie. Look up, there was a guy,

7
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,030
there was a dude,
um,

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,920
recently he was caught poaching and
Missouri and the judge said that he had to

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,240
um, watch Bambi once a month
during his entire sentence.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,500
Why? It's if you find that that is real,
that just needs a reality show. He like,

11
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,460
oh, I don't know what to do, honey. I
know what to do. We'll make it much Bambi.

12
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,740
He poached a deer.
This is the guy who like the whole other,

13
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:47,130
it was like a whole family
guys. Here we're in like a
poaching ring or something.

14
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,940
I read this on the way
over here. Um, here it is.

15
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,350
Dear poacher sentence to watch Bambi every
month during a year in Missouri jail.

16
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,640
Yeah. This might be a judge that's
like looking for a little steely,

17
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,790
killed hundreds of deer sometimes taking
over their heads and leaving the rest

18
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,520
to Rodan fields. Keep. Ah,

19
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,130
how about you keep that guy in jail
for more than a year? There he is.

20
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,500
Look at him. David Barry Jr. Look at him.

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,150
Fucking Dork has been ordered
to watch one thing, man.

22
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,690
If that guy was killing him because he
was poor and he was just eating deer and

23
00:01:18,691 --> 00:01:23,040
that's how he made his, that's how he got
food. That's not the case. He don't care.

24
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,040
He chopping the heads off and just
took the heads guy. Just fuck.

25
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:27,660
Fuck anybody who does that anyway.

26
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:32,280
Fuck anybody who just wants to shoot
something as damn delicious and massive as

27
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:36,460
a deer. A deer could feed a family
for months. Do you understand?

28
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,430
Of course it could.
You understand that,

29
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,350
but I mean people
listening or this asshole,

30
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,680
do you understand that this asshole who
shot this fucking thing a hundred years

31
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,740
head off you piece of shit
five I'm puncher can look
forward to eating deer and

32
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:53,640
you shot it and you, yeah. Anyway,
back back like Walt Disney.

33
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:57,580
I think like that kind of
treatment of animals has been,

34
00:01:57,581 --> 00:02:00,360
it's been something that's hurt honey.
And the third one is hunters.

35
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,390
I've heard themselves like that guy.
Like maybe that's a poacher.

36
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,300
Not a nice way worse. That's a
poacher. Not a hunter though.

37
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:10,380
But he's a guy who hunting
illegally. That's what it
poaching is. He's honor. Yeah,

38
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,050
but like camping. Camping illegally. He's
trespassing. It's not the same. Yeah,

39
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,280
but you're camping. You're trespassing
in camping. Camping. Right. Maybe he's,

40
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,390
I know you don't want them to call him a
hunter. Like you know, like someone who,

41
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,100
who goes on stage at a company
picnic is not a comedian. Yes.

42
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,060
It's the same thing. I get it. Yeah. I
mean he's still killing animals. Yeah.

43
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,520
He's killing more than me.
That's a hundred. Yeah.

44
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,370
I'm a hunter and he's killed more
than the official budget. That's true.

45
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,090
This is a piece of shit he is, but
that's just like everything else, man.

46
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,940
There's people that are good Uber drivers
and there's some that will try to pull

47
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:45,850
you under a bridge and fuck your mouth.
This is bad people.

48
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,910
That's a good point to bring up.
Like is there,

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,220
is there a time like I always bring
up with hunting, it's, it's like, oh,

50
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,900
somebody killed a giraffe or somebody,
the guy killed a family,

51
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:58,980
baboons and made a and did a photo. I
saw that. Do you see that? Not Good.

52
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,040
Not Good. Well that's, that's
a fucking primate bro. Yeah.

53
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,860
I mean there's nothing good about that
with the idea that we're going to go well

54
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:09,700
for you. It's never going to go well
for you. Yeah. Did he put it online? No,

55
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:11,570
he didn't put her on line is I guess the,

56
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,990
the credit that we would give
the guy who put it online,

57
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,550
the Idaho Statesman or whatever the
Idaho local paper was a picture,

58
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,070
I don't know, per from one of
the folks, he sent an email,

59
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:24,610
a mass email out to some friends and
colleagues and things of like recapping,

60
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,290
recapping is hunt in Africa. Like
here's all the things I did. And He,

61
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:33,490
I think from my reading when the guy
shot the guy and I got a lot of mutual

62
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:37,710
friends with him, so he's a good
guy. Like he just screwed up. I made,

63
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,500
made a bad choice. That's a
tough sell, I would say so too.

64
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,280
But I should put him in a cell and make,
he is a monkey movies.

65
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,780
I think he knew like if I put this,
if I put this, you got to watch,

66
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:54,400
that's going to spin up after this
planet of the apes.

67
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:59,320
You gotta watch the Mark Wahlberg Planet
of the apes, the reality of baboons.

68
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:03,040
And I have, um, I've studied
the work of Robert Sapolsky,

69
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,110
who's a guy who's been on
the podcast before in it's,

70
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,050
it's really pretty amazing stuff.

71
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,290
What they found out about baboons that
he studied actually because he actually

72
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:16,000
studied a baboons tribe that
the Alpha males died off.

73
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,390
They were all eating out of
a poisoned garbage patch. Uh,

74
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,920
there was a garbage patch to that sick
food in it. And um, uh, just bad food.

75
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,810
And the Alpha males who got to eat first
always chased everybody that they wound

76
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:32,440
up dying off.
And for more than one generation,

77
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:33,910
I think it was several generations,

78
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,240
they became like really peaceful and
calm and they weren't the vicious violent

79
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:44,890
baboons that are the norm. And that it's
true. It's really, if you Google it, uh,

80
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,480
so Paul Ski Studies, baboons and I and
radio lab also had a podcast about it,

81
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:50,740
which is where I first heard about it.

82
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,530
And then I read what
supple ski wrote about it.

83
00:04:53,531 --> 00:04:55,320
But it is unbelievably fascinating.

84
00:04:55,321 --> 00:05:00,321
It shows how you can have this
insane violent animal culture.

85
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,460
And then the,
the Kuntz get removed.

86
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,770
And when the cons get removed, everybody
chills the fuck out. And it's really,

87
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,360
really quite fascinating. But I'm
baboons for the most part. I mean,

88
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:15,910
maybe he shot the nicest Pelicans ever,
but for the most part,

89
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,120
they're a bunch of baby and cunts
and they'll steal your fucking kid.

90
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,800
That little two year old
that you love so dearly,

91
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:23,290
that little motherfucker be
on a, uh, a porch somewhere.

92
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,590
And if there's baboons around,
they'll snatch him and hit his head.

93
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,890
That's like when I was in Africa,

94
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:31,891
I hunted Africa one time in my life and
the R P H and r guide both said at our

95
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:34,480
church as a professional honor,
right?

96
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,370
The structure is like there's
a professional hunter,

97
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:37,510
which is essentially your guide.

98
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:41,690
And then there's trackers
which are usually native
folks that that help tracking

99
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:45,670
the game, spot, the animals, things
like that. But our, our Ph, he was like,

100
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:48,000
if you see a bad Boone shoot it.
It's like we have Eri,

101
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,670
we have lots of irrigation here to
maintain this ranch and they rip it up and

102
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:55,720
they're, you know, basically
terrorists around, you know,
coming around at our camp,

103
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:58,760
mess with their fires,
messing our food was it,

104
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:03,470
you see one shoot one and that was the
instruction that I got and I never,

105
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:08,390
never did. But you know,
given that instruction from
somebody like that, like, hey,

106
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:11,000
this is a good thing for our landscape.
Go and do it now.

107
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,250
That's very far removed
from stacking them up,

108
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:18,580
like stack very far and with a big
smile on your face holding a bow isn't,

109
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,360
it doesn't make any sheen a baby. There's
some babies. It's like a whole family.

110
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,950
You can't, they don't stay in one place
either. You guys came to you and I said,

111
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,300
listen Joe,
here's my plan.

112
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:34,690
What I'm going to do is go to
Africa and hunt and then you know,

113
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:37,160
like I'm going to shoot some baboons.
I mean it's a good thing for this.

114
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:39,610
I'd be like, don't tell anybody. Yeah.
You'd be like, don't, don't take,

115
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,490
certainly don't take a photo of you posing
with an entire family of the deceased

116
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:48,050
primate. I had a friend who was in
Africa and he got attacked by, by boom,

117
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,880
boom bap, boom to steals
food. Yeah. I forgot what the
context of it was. It was, uh,

118
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,330
quite a few years ago,
but he said it was spooky.

119
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,160
He said they don't seem like a a monkey
and they don't seem like they seem like

120
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:02,210
a dog monkey.

121
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,710
Like could you ever see when
they open their mouth? Yes.

122
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,940
It's like a dog mouth.
They're like dog monkey.

123
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,660
It's like a dog fucked a monkey.
Like if you really like show a baboons,

124
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,600
baboons with its mouth open.
Never thought of it that way.

125
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:20,300
But I'll give it to you,
but they have a long stretched out mouth,

126
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:23,210
like a wolf or something that's
not, it's like a werewolf. Yeah.

127
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:27,300
It's not like a regular person.
They're real weird man. They, they,

128
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,320
they have all these characteristics
that are of primates,

129
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,710
but then they have this extra
weirdness to them as well. Yeah.

130
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,030
And this wildness to him too,

131
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:38,300
but it doesn't that come down to like
the core of some of these. Oh my God.

132
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,140
I mean, come on, look at that. That's
like a werewolf. Yeah. That is a werewolf.

133
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,430
That's like part, look
at that face, that lion.

134
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,560
I can roll back, but look at
this. Even the shape of the jaw.

135
00:07:51,561 --> 00:07:56,360
It's very dog.
Like it's very elongated and dog.

136
00:07:56,361 --> 00:08:00,980
Like they're very, it's a very
strange animal. Look at that face man.

137
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:04,910
And that is a crazy beast.
And my friend said, uh,

138
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,480
I forget the story is
quite a long time ago,

139
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,740
I stole some food and snarled at him and,
and snatch something from him.

140
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,970
But he said it was very scary. He said,
and you know, it wasn't even that big,

141
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,610
would be like 60 70 pounds or
something like that. And he said,

142
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:21,530
but it's been pending.
They'll fuck you up.
