1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,880
Right.
Do you think that it's possible?

2
00:00:02,881 --> 00:00:05,520
Do you ever entertain the idea that
it's possible that we are the only

3
00:00:05,521 --> 00:00:09,720
intelligent life in the known universe?
I like,

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,330
I tend to restrict myself to the galaxy,
right?

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:18,350
So I do think it's possible that at the
moment there's one civilization in the

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,340
Milky Way and that's us. And I
think that's important. Actually.

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,910
It goes back to, I was saying
at the start about the, uh,

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,080
astronomy and cosmology being part of
the framework within which you have to

9
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:36,081
think if you're looking for meaning or
you're looking for how we should behave

10
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:40,560
even politically. You know, the,
that has a bearing to me, I mean,

11
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:45,561
imagine that we're the only place where
there is intelligence in this galaxy and

12
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,960
how should we behave,
right?

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,520
Should we actually not withstanding the
fact that we are tiny and fragile things

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,380
and insignificant physically,

15
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,860
should we consider ourselves extremely
valuable in that respect because there's

16
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:02,910
nowhere else where you,
you know,

17
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,450
that I would go as far as to say there
would be nowhere else where meaning

18
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:08,010
exists in the Milky Way.

19
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,850
Because meaning it's one of those things
that scientists don't talk about very

20
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:16,200
much. Although Richard Fineman, one
of my great heroes did talk about it.

21
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,830
There's a quote where he says,
what is the meaning of it all?

22
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,200
It's a great essay called the value of
science and so what is self evidently

23
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:29,490
true is that meaning exists here because
it means some things he was so that's

24
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:31,170
kind of an obvious statement.

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,160
Your life mean something to you
and me and so meaning exists,

26
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,440
but I think it is a local and
temporary phenomenon. I think it's,

27
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,000
it emerges meaning emerges
from configurations of atoms,

28
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,500
which is what we are. We are simply
that. We're nothing more than that.

29
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:50,731
We're very,

30
00:01:50,731 --> 00:01:55,731
very rare configurations of atoms I
think and so that means that we are,

31
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,570
if you go all the way
down that line of logic,

32
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:03,420
we are the only island
meaning in the galaxy.

33
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,930
I meaning only to ourselves.
Yeah.

34
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,530
It means something to us because we're
the only ones who can grasp the concept

35
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,780
and we are finite.
We are finite organism.

36
00:02:15,781 --> 00:02:20,640
We have this temporary existence while
we're here and to us there is meaning.

37
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,400
Yeah. And that's, I don't know
any other way to define it,

38
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,620
so I'll define it like that. I
don't think there's globe. Yeah.

39
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,240
Otherwise you have to believe there's
some kind of global meaning and that's a

40
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:33,210
god thing.
I don't think that's,

41
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,990
I think it's more wonderful and,

42
00:02:35,991 --> 00:02:40,800
and more challenging to us because we
have to take responsibility for it to say

43
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,270
we should operate search that
we are it in this galaxy.

44
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,420
There's nothing else. I'm sure. I'm just,

45
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,530
I'm sure there are other civilizations
out there in the universe because are 2

46
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,030
trillion galaxies. I, I just can't believe
this hasn't happened in other places.

47
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,590
The question is how often does it then,

48
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:04,330
how widely spaced out of civilizations
and I think they're very widely spaced

49
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,930
and I think there may be one or
two per galaxy on the average.

50
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,510
I could put that as you said,

51
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,420
that what you said at Beazley that
what else can we think? Right.

52
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,630
Well and what else do you want?
I mean,

53
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:21,040
I think what it says is you have to take
responsibility for all those things or

54
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:24,460
spiritual things that you think about
and the emotional things you think about

55
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,420
it. You, you, you are, you
are responsible for that.

56
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,690
You are that for that,
whatever that is,

57
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:37,050
it exists in you and it will only
exist for short amount of time and so

58
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,420
well, you know, make the
best of it will be my beats.

59
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,440
So unbelievably compelling though to
consider the idea that somewhere out there

60
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,040
there's another civilization that may
be even more advanced than us and this,

61
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,540
this thought of it is just
so attractive. It's, it's,

62
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,580
it's incredible.

63
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,330
They're the shit there should be,
if,

64
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,380
if civilizations are common
or even slightly common,

65
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,570
then there should be civilizations ahead
of us because there's been so much time.

66
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,460
But wouldn't you want to see
what that's like? Yeah. I mean,

67
00:04:11,461 --> 00:04:12,600
we've been a compelling,

68
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,780
you imagined the timescales we've
been around as a civilization,

69
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,650
let's say 40,000 years. I don't know how
long our civilization has been around.

70
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:21,600
Let's say that the,
the,

71
00:04:21,601 --> 00:04:26,601
the galaxy is pretty much as old as the
university's 13 billion years worth of

72
00:04:27,751 --> 00:04:32,580
time. So the idea that there are
no, no civilizations, arrows,

73
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:37,200
you know, a hundred million years ago, 200
million years ago, 1 billion years ago.

74
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,160
And imagine what they be like if
they'd survived. I mean, we've been,

75
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:41,790
we've been around,

76
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:46,790
we've had science for let's say Cindy
to neaten are Kapernick is 500 years at

77
00:04:47,341 --> 00:04:49,820
most. We've had, and look
what we've done, we've,

78
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,150
we've gone beyond the solar system
with voyager. We've walked on the moon.

79
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,630
Um, we've, we're, we're about
to go to Mars, I would think.

80
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,420
So we're about to begin colonizing
our own solar system. Um,

81
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,080
so we've done that in 500 years.

82
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:09,090
So imagine a million years in the future.
So I would,

83
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,790
it's one of the arguments
often used to say,

84
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,370
there aren't any civilizations
out there in the galaxy.

85
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,990
It's called the Fermi paradox.

86
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,170
Because if you imagine a civilization
that's a million years ahead of us,

87
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,350
they should have written their
presence across the sky by now.

88
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,540
They should use to see them.
I mean,

89
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:29,370
you'll see us if we survive in million
years into the future. Actually,

90
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,800
even a few thousand years in the future,

91
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,560
we will be exploring the galaxy.

92
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,070
We will have spacecraft that are going
to have the stars. We will be doing it.

93
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,380
So our signature will become visible.

94
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:45,270
I'm sure if we last into the medium term,
would we choose to

95
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,450
not do that?

96
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,070
Here's my thought on that
is uncontacted tribes like,

97
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:53,990
do you know about the,
the gentleman who was the,

98
00:05:53,991 --> 00:05:56,660
a missionary who visited
North Sentinel Island? Yeah.

99
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,000
It was killed by the natives
north central island,

100
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:03,020
which is a really unusual place because
they branched off from Africa 60,000

101
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:06,260
years ago and they've been living on this
one small ion, the size of Manhattan.

102
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,030
And as well as we know,

103
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:12,470
there's only about 39 of them left
somewhere around there. And um,

104
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,860
we can't, we're not supposed to contact
them like people were not supposed we,

105
00:06:16,861 --> 00:06:18,680
we're supposed to like leave them alone.

106
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,010
And there are rare tribe when
they find them in the Amazon.

107
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:26,090
The uncontacted tribes are
initial instinct is back
off back when you leave them

108
00:06:26,091 --> 00:06:29,330
alone. Leave them alone. Do you
think that perhaps the universe,

109
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,460
like if there is a civilization that's a
million times more advanced than us and

110
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,910
been around here for you know,

111
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,030
the millions of years of life
as opposed to quarter million,

112
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,810
why would they,
why would they let us know?

113
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,700
They look at us dropping bombs on
each other and polluting the ocean.

114
00:06:45,701 --> 00:06:50,570
It's sucking all the fish out and putting
the clouds into the skies of dirt and

115
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,440
particles and why would they like look
at these crude monkeys. Look are there,

116
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:54,970
they don't,

117
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:59,810
they're so far beyond where they need to
be before they could join the galactic

118
00:06:59,811 --> 00:07:02,530
civilization or whatever.
It is true.

119
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,240
It's an argument that the
reason argument as well,

120
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:10,270
the IT technology so advanced would
be difficult for us to detect.

121
00:07:10,551 --> 00:07:14,000
I mean we tend to think of, you know,
when you say written across the sky,

122
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,750
I suppose it's true, I'm thinking of star
ships and things like star wars, right?

123
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,450
Big Energy.
Things that you can see the signature of,

124
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,240
but actually it may be that
the civilization just becomes
a nano civilization in

125
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,070
a tiny little,
none of it because that's more efficient.

126
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,910
It's a better way to do things.
So it's possible, I suppose,

127
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,310
that there are space
probes all over the place.

128
00:07:34,311 --> 00:07:37,040
They're so small and it's
so efficient and you sell,

129
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:41,180
it'll energy that we just don't see him.
I suppose that is possible.
