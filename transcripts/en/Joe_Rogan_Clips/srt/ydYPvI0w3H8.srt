00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,930
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,830
Like I didn't smoke blunts until I
hung out with Charlie Murphy. Really?

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,750
Charlie used to smoke legit blunts.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,740
Like he had his cousin rich who had
rolled these legit blondes out of like

5
00:00:12,741 --> 00:00:15,620
Swisher sweets.
Take out the tobacco,

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,880
leave like a little bit in and then roll
it up with weed and then lick it down

7
00:00:19,881 --> 00:00:20,714
and we would get home.

8
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,520
Yeah, nervous. Hi. Terrifying high.

9
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:32,740
He was one of the hardest deaths that
I ever had to deal with. Really? Yeah,

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,220
because I wish I contacted him more.
I wish we got together more,

11
00:00:36,221 --> 00:00:40,570
but we were always on the road. You
know that guy's a man. Like he was a,

12
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,100
he was a real man, like, like,

13
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,500
like he never had any like weird
shit yet a work through. He was,

14
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,400
he always held his mud.
Like Charlie was different man.

15
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,390
He was like a guy who didn't come into
celebrity at all until his forties so was

16
00:00:55,391 --> 00:00:58,850
developed.
He was a real man that's loves that guide.

17
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:02,620
So it's one of those guys
like sometimes you get tired,

18
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,150
you get tired,

19
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:09,151
you're just doing too many things and
you've for forget to concentrate on people

20
00:01:09,161 --> 00:01:11,410
that you've run into in your
life that you're like, God damn,

21
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:15,390
that guy was a good dude. Like Charlie
Murphy was a good motherfucker.

22
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:20,200
Like he had a joke on stage that
talked about it wasn't trying to,

23
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,680
but he was like, he goes,
people say to me, you know
that people yell out Chai Man.

24
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:29,380
Hey John and Matt, hey. He goes,
hey man said, have a bother you.

25
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:34,600
It's just yells out Charlie Murphy.
Every time he seen he goes, no.

26
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,260
He goes, because for the first
time in my life it was like,

27
00:01:38,261 --> 00:01:43,220
hey you Eddie Murphy's brother.
Right? Anybody laugh about it onstage,

28
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,410
like slap as ne and like
that was real for him. Sure.

29
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:52,530
We got to experience a guy who like went
through a whole life as a grown man and

30
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:56,100
was approaching middle age
before fame kicked in wild man.

31
00:01:56,101 --> 00:01:59,980
He only had like a 10 15
year ride before he died.

32
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:06,430
Yeah. Was a good dude, man. The
magnitude of like, you know that show,

33
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:11,260
but like particularly like two sketches,
like that's how big an impact.

34
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,970
Those two sketches,

35
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,870
they would just play that I
remember when he started a tour,

36
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,360
you know when you go to the
clubs they play it before. Oh,

37
00:02:19,361 --> 00:02:22,840
just that like of the teaser that he's
coming coming next week or two weeks from

38
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:22,891
now.

39
00:02:22,891 --> 00:02:26,760
It would be just like a little bit of
like the Rick James Sketch or the print

40
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,780
separate and fucking all
the shows be styled. Man.

41
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,050
You know what man, he didn't, man,

42
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:39,610
I really feel like there's a developmental
process that you can apply to like

43
00:02:39,611 --> 00:02:41,830
UFC fighters and even stand up comedians.

44
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,500
If you take a guy who's
got some potential,

45
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,550
then you make them fight Anderson Silva
in his prime when he's 20 years old and

46
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:52,090
he gets knocked unconscious, he's
never going to be the same again. Yeah.

47
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,580
And I almost feel like this is
the same thing with comedians.

48
00:02:54,581 --> 00:02:59,581
I don't care if you're 40 or 50 or 60
or 20 to go onstage and eat is horrific.

49
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:01,150
Yeah.

50
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:06,130
And what Charlie did was he went from
being a guy who was on the supple show to

51
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:09,030
hosting a show with other
comedians like Darnell. Yeah.

52
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,930
And a and Dave and whoever was on the
show and talking a little like, Hey,

53
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,780
what's up?
And instead of just continuing to do that,

54
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,070
he started headlining cause that where
the money, that's where the money was. No,

55
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,600
no up and Mike famous.
So bringer shows. No, no

56
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,700
dude, we did 22 dates together,
22 days together and we swapped.

57
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,360
Who went back and forth? Like he headlined
one. I had one, one, he and mine one,

58
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,480
I headlined one and he just fucked
member. Those Doug, his seat.

59
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,740
Who have either when you were on, well I
swapped, but I did three. I did Irvine,

60
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,290
San Diego, and Phoenix. And so damn,

61
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:49,030
you did three different
people in different nights.
But I saw, yeah, I saw him.

62
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,970
I saw him struggle when I
must've been rough. Oh my God.

63
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,720
And then I saw him actually do really
well the next night. Really? Yeah. Yeah.

64
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,960
Well if he can get on the middle spot,
he could do pretty good.

65
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,210
He was a funny dude, but it's
just not, it's not a good number.

66
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,340
It's not the right place to put
some money. His mega millions joke.

67
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,280
Do you remember he was doing that?
You had a bunch of great jokes.

68
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,950
He had a bunch of gay jokes. Man.
He was a funny and and offstage,

69
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:19,030
maybe one of the funniest guys of all
time. He took me to dinner on that thing,

70
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,030
which I didn't expect and I don't
think rich wanted me to come and,

71
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:27,340
and like we went out to dinner and he
was, yeah, no, no, no. He, his cousin,

72
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:31,900
his cousin. But he was as, he
was like, what you like that
show was fresh. That was,

73
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:36,370
you know, and like he, he
was telling stories. He was,

74
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,660
he told the story that I texted you
to ask him when you had them on.

75
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,420
I go ask him if he could let
go if Johnny guilt. Yeah,

76
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,780
cause it fucking Mike Tyson
Tiger story. Yeah. Oh,

77
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,330
that's what you're going to story.
Pet Tiger.

78
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:55,460
No one want to get out of
the limousine. Yeah. So

79
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:00,160
crazy though. Did you ever
hear the busboys story? Which
ones? That Charlie Murphy.

80
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:05,120
When is Eddie let him borrow clothes?
No. Oh my God. That's so funny.

81
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,400
That's so funny. I'll never do it justice.
And it's so good when he tells it. No,

82
00:05:10,401 --> 00:05:11,030
you got to tell it.

83
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:14,990
You got to tell it cause then I can sit
available online so you gotta find it.

84
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,750
So see if you can find,
you know,

85
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:20,720
you're never gonna be able to find it
cause it's in snoop Dogg's podcast. Oh,

86
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,620
all right. Oh I bet. I bet someone's put
it on Youtube. I know Bert Kreischer did.

87
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,350
I fucking grabbed it the day he died.
And I was like,

88
00:05:27,351 --> 00:05:29,480
this is one of the best stories I've
ever, that's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

89
00:05:29,481 --> 00:05:32,600
That's where I saw it. Yeah. But I don't
know how I put it online. But anyway,

90
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,960
to make,
he gets,

91
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:39,380
he comes out of the navy and he comes out
to La and then they all want to go out

92
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:42,790
to a party. But all these guys,
navy clothes, he's just out and ed,

93
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:46,940
he's the biggest fucking movie star on
earth. Right. So his brother is like,

94
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,800
and it's young primetime.
Oh is this it? Yeah.

95
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:57,320
Oh, just play this place.
Give me some shit high.

96
00:05:57,321 --> 00:05:57,980
When Eddie had to

97
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,680
fly outfits,
did you ever like take that away?

98
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,270
Oh Man. You know what he did
like Nigga, take my shit off.

99
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,550
One of the most brutal,
brutal experiences, outfits.

100
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,770
I first got out the navy, I came out
to La and my brother was huge, right?

101
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:17,590
So we hanging out at different tables.
He had, you know, show business clothing.

102
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,080
He was supposed to have it. No, he was
just showman. Everybody knew he was.

103
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,500
So he happened to own a glitter busboy.

104
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:30,500
Jack up from the boys are back in town.
Bus Boy Jack.

105
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,180
And we was going out to the,
it was a century 21 over there.

106
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:38,360
Then there was a club over. He said,
Yo man, you want to wear this jacket?

107
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,130
So the jacket was a green
glitter busboys Jack.

108
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,300
I'm trying to get my stamp coming out
of the navy. All I had was uniform.

109
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,590
I put the busboy jacking or
they had my chains and all that.

110
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,520
And then we went to the club and I thought
I was coming and walking through the

111
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:59,180
club and I hear everybody go, yeah,
Mrs Eddie Murphy from New York

112
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:05,260
who's up behind the group that
they could do, which I don't know,

113
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:10,261
it looked like [inaudible].

114
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,660
I was like, Yo man, the,
and started burning gas,

115
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,010
sit down with somebody, just poured
kerosene on, executive lit this shit up.

116
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,020
Ah,

117
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,220
do you know when he died?

118
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,500
I used to enjoy and I knew this would
be a Tom cause you guys a tour with him.

119
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:35,200
He was like, you don't know how funny is
he thought he could fight Billy Gill? No,

120
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,130
he said that Johnny Gill, Johnny Gill,
we're looking at the screen and his ass.

121
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,500
He's like, you think Oscar de la Hoya
could fuck you up? And I was like, yeah.

122
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,470
He's like, I know. Right? And I was
like, yeah man, he's a professional.

123
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,340
He would ruin your life. And he was like,
Johnny Gill thinks he could fuck him up.

124
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,660
I was like,
what?

125
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,770
And then he started telling a story
about how he was hanging out with Johnny

126
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,020
Gill and Johnny Gill just
looked at TV and was like,

127
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,030
I could fuck up to Oscar de la Hoya.
And he was like,

128
00:08:04,031 --> 00:08:07,210
what are you talking about man?
In the way that child, he's like,

129
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,120
Oscar de Hilbert Bray rearrange
the whole way. You Shit. Look man.

130
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,590
And, and Johnny gale was like, no, he's
pretty. He's like, that don't mean shit.

131
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,440
Punch a hole in your face.

132
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:23,420
Charlie Charlie Murphy was at dinner
with Maury Smith who is a former UFC

133
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:24,590
heavyweight champion of the world.

134
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,330
I haven't salivary who's a former UFC
fighter who actually had a move that we

135
00:08:29,331 --> 00:08:31,640
started crying the salivary.
Remember Ivan?

136
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,930
Ivan had a move where it was
what wasn't really his mood,

137
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:38,930
but it was a move that he was one of
the first guys to tap somebody with it

138
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,700
where he got the triangle from the back
and elevated his hips to like press down

139
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:47,240
on your back. Guys were tapping out
from like getting triangled from behind.

140
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,850
We started realizing like how dangerous
that movie, so I haven't salivary,

141
00:08:50,851 --> 00:08:54,680
it's like a time tested warrior,
right? So Maurice Smith,

142
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:57,210
former heavyweight champion Ivan salivary,

143
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:02,530
Charlie Murphy is explaining why y'all
Niggas don't know about the Chicago Ridge.

144
00:09:02,531 --> 00:09:05,060
Hey,
please explain.

145
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:08,530
And some particular
like martial arts move.

146
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:12,970
It's called the rich hand and it's a
strike and I don't know what the Chicago

147
00:09:12,971 --> 00:09:13,804
rich hand was,

148
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:18,220
but Charles was insistent that no one
was trying out the Chicago Ridge hand in

149
00:09:18,221 --> 00:09:20,020
MMA and that people could do it.

150
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:23,980
And like they were laughing and Charlie
was like, no, fuck you. He goes,

151
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,950
you tell me. I don't, I don't hit
you in the head with a rich hand.

152
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:31,560
Red Ban took a picture and I put
it up on my Instagram. I find it.

153
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,300
It's Charlie Murphy standing up.

154
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:39,010
How are e Smith and the Ivan Salad
right now like this? Like Ah,

155
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:44,080
Charlie's got his hand up at this time.
Roddy chopping something on the bridge.

156
00:09:44,081 --> 00:09:48,750
They notes. I'll hit you on the
bridge. He, oh no, dude, we were,

157
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:53,550
we were, it's like fancy fucking Ruth's
Chris Steak House somewhere. Yeah.

158
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,113
Cry.

159
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,020
Charlie Murphy was crushing like
that's a natural thing on the,

160
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,870
I mean like I look at him
and I go just him. Yeah.

161
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,150
How much fun would it have been the
first time you were sitting on those ship

162
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:09,800
else? That and he showed
any told that uh, that's it.

163
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,620
That's it. That's the photo. That
guy in the right hand corner is my,

164
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:19,490
is Marvin Sapp. That's Ivan salivary and
bright to his left. Her Charlie Murphy's.

165
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,940
Right? Go for the black
guy. That's Maury Smith.

166
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:26,390
That's Maurice for that is the former
UFC heavyweight champion of the world.

167
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:29,590
That's trolley talking about standing up.

168
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,550
Look how wide his eyes are.

169
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,620
Look at the smile underneath his left arm.
Look at that guy laugh.

170
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:41,840
Everybody said yes. Hi. I'm
wish I was in this photo,

171
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:46,370
but I was crying too, but I was probably
under the table at this point. Like

172
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,030
I did that podcast with Joe.

173
00:10:50,031 --> 00:10:53,180
It was like the same sort of situation
I said under the table crying at that

174
00:10:53,181 --> 00:10:57,860
point. Like, I love you guys, but I
got to head out. We're all going to go.

175
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:02,810
This is the point. Like Ralphy
like Charlie, like everybody,
we're all going to go.

176
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,800
You know, the quicker you realize that,
the quicker you get that in your head,

177
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:11,000
the more you'll enjoy this
weird time we're in the
sunshine right after the rain.

178
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,080
It doesn't last. It's a good time to
be a comic. It's good time to be alive.

179
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,370
But is it the human race as a
person? All of us, there's no,

180
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,630
no one gets out alive. No.
One quicker. We remember that.

181
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,560
The better. We're all be not work.

182
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:37,610
Okay.
