1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,313
Yeah,

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,360
it's like a muscle twitch go. You'd go,
just see how far you can make it happen.

3
00:00:04,361 --> 00:00:07,040
Horse. So you start talking and
then being an agent and a foot race,

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,600
put your money where your mouth,
this asshole.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,310
You just see eyes widen and they're
like, yeah, you're like, dude,

6
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:21,780
we're not at a seminar right now.
That's what's bullshit about seminars.

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,560
I mean came back and if you were
in the world of business, see,

8
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:28,460
I really think this is one of the reasons
why so many people are so fucked up

9
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:29,071
and so depressed.

10
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:34,071
I think the world of showing to showing
up to a place and then having your

11
00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:39,171
behavior limited into this very narrow
and rigid parameters all day long and

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,050
your livelihood and your success of your,

13
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,450
your family and whether or not you
can send your kids to a good school.

14
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,110
All that dependent upon whether or
not you're willing to play the rules,

15
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,560
you have to wear an outfit with a
suit and tie because if you don't,

16
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,350
you might be unpredictable and
you show up with that t shirt on.

17
00:00:55,351 --> 00:00:58,410
He's got a foot pole shirt on at work.
What the fuck is he drunk?

18
00:00:58,411 --> 00:01:02,110
What is he going crazy? He's
doing drugs. You can't true

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,580
join around people that don't just
light joins around people. You like the

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,233
Steckler.

21
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,860
I crashed Tesla's stock by $9 billion.

22
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,390
Shit. So crazy. Yeah, but not
really. It bounced right back.

23
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:24,630
Is that world like the guy can't? First
of all, we were drinking whisky. Okay.

24
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,840
No one has a problem with that,
which is way more of a hard drug.

25
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,710
Way more of a crazy drug. Then a little
puff of a joint. We were drinking whiskey.

26
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:34,710
No one cared. We drank whiskey
for three hours. No one cared.

27
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,640
Smoked a little joint. Oh, you think
he inhaled it? Didn't look like it.

28
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:41,530
Then look away and just took like a
ninth grader. He didn't know what to do.

29
00:01:41,531 --> 00:01:43,980
He took a little puff, you know? Yeah.

30
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,190
New Kid at school just needs, everyone
just wants to, oh, I do it too.

31
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,410
No bad. Yeah. Fascinating.
Yeah, it was crazy.

32
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,070
He did it and I mean another layer of
it. He did it in California. Exactly.

33
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,770
Totally, totally legal. Yeah. Yeah.

34
00:01:58,771 --> 00:02:01,320
It's no different than having
that class with whiskey. You know,

35
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:04,270
California said he could fly
with it. Now what? Lex said,

36
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:06,870
you could have an ounce of weed
with you on an airplane. They said,

37
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:09,480
we don't know what the fuck's going to
happen when you land somewhere where you

38
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:12,780
can go through lax with an ounce
of weed. I'm sorry. By the way,

39
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,800
I looked up private suite after
I talked to you. Super expensive.

40
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,850
So expensive, stupid, expensive. How
did you know about it? Uh, Sam Harris.

41
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,180
He told me about it.
Yeah.
