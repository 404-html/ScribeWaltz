1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,610
If we did end up in our bags was not
to put a massive amount of effort into

2
00:00:03,611 --> 00:00:06,790
getting up, just play garden
and stay safe because you know,

3
00:00:06,791 --> 00:00:10,270
the next round starts on the feet and
tried to do damage there but it's still

4
00:00:10,271 --> 00:00:13,500
tiring and I, I, you know, kind
of gets a hard time about as a,

5
00:00:13,501 --> 00:00:16,000
Yvette is cardio all the time,
but who is,

6
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:20,650
could be faced that didn't look like
that after two rounds and winter I quit.

7
00:00:20,651 --> 00:00:23,100
Yeah. Yeah. I mean I was super impressed.

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,050
Ally Quinta in that fight.

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,860
It especially considering he came
into that fight looking for a third,

10
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,690
a three round fight. I mean that
was what he was trained for, right?

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,890
He was trained for a three round fight
and it changes up and all of a sudden

12
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:38,180
he's in a five round fight for
the title. Fucking crazy. Yeah.

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,030
Crazy set of circumstances.
But it almost makes you wonder,

14
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,830
and this is maybe you could speak to
this better than anybody, how much,

15
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,380
how much is too much and in regard
to training for a fight like this,

16
00:00:51,381 --> 00:00:55,890
like maybe training for a three round
fight is the way to go when you have to

17
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:58,800
fight a five round fight so
you're not so fucking beat up.

18
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,880
By the time you get to the fight, if you
already know how to fight five rounds,

19
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:03,750
you've already done it.

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,500
If you're a guy like Conor was just
got so much experience in the game,

21
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,660
it might be that it's like there's a
point of diminishing returns in terms of

22
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:15,750
your strength and conditioning
and that guys just go too far,

23
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,740
pushed too hard and just don't
have it when it comes to, I mean,

24
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,760
how many times have you seen a fighter
be overtrained when they fight?

25
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,350
Very often. Definitely. You know, they've,

26
00:01:27,351 --> 00:01:30,710
they've given their best rounds and the
gym and it's very difficult as well.

27
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:33,530
And those last two weeks,
because anxiety is starting to grow.

28
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,120
So you want to train harder,

29
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,330
you'd want to get one more aspiring and
you want to know because the flight's

30
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,561
coming.

31
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:42,050
And so it's almost like when you were
back in school and you were cramming for

32
00:01:42,051 --> 00:01:46,220
an exam, the exam's tomorrow, I'm going
to stay up all night studying. You know,

33
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,600
it actually got me through
college, so I worked so much. But,

34
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,370
but in fighting we got to do, we've got
to do the opposite. We don't have it.

35
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,200
We've got to have a
solid taper off period.

36
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:58,080
And that is hard when you're dealing with
a 20 something year old man and he's,

37
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,330
he's dealing with what's,
what's coming around the corner.
So, but you know, that's,

38
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,100
that's the trainer's job. You know. How
much did he taper off for this fight? Uh,

39
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:06,801
same as usual.

40
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:11,200
We have about a two week taper off period
where we start bringing it down. Um,

41
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:16,010
he did that. He did actually spar
even after that. Um, you know, we're,

42
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,650
we were working very hard for this
fight and the limit, you know,

43
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,290
somewhat limited period
of time. Um, so we did,

44
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,510
didn't taper off quite the
way we would normally do,

45
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:26,990
but roughly two weeks if
you want to do a rematch

46
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,660
and the UFC did grant agreement,

47
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,810
this is obviously dependent upon how
the Nevada state athletic commission

48
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:38,220
handles the legal ramifications of him
jumping out of the cage, attacking Dylan,

49
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:43,140
Dan as the subsequent brawl,
the chaos that ensued visas.

50
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,290
You mean you're,
you're dealing with a lot of legal shit,

51
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,040
this fight that could hold things
up. I mean, they held both guys

52
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,860
as person is correct. Uh, well the
held a Habib's Conor got his. Okay.

53
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:54,694
Conor goes press.

54
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,350
So he gets his first and be,
I mean,

55
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:02,790
who the fuck knows what's going to happen
with him, you know, and uh, yeah, I,

56
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:06,250
I hope they're, they're lenient on them
and I'm not just so we can get a rematch.

57
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:09,670
I mean, I love watching him
fight first. That, and I can,

58
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:15,010
I can stretch myself to understand his
reaction. I can stretch myself to under,

59
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,020
I can't stretch myself to understand the
order guys' reactions on what they did

60
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,700
for him. He jumped over the
cage and he jumps on. It's,

61
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,200
it's not the end of the horse. The guy
that jumped in there was wearing red.

62
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:30,130
Who punched on her. Yeah. I'm not sure.
I think that's the Xbox and coach,

63
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:33,520
but I'm guessing he's a fighter.
He fights for the UFC, uh,

64
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:37,990
into red was done not an old, he wasn't
older. He actually worked with them. Oh,

65
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,980
okay. You, there you go. Who
is he? I don't know his name.

66
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:47,710
Either. Islam or son. Yeah. Yeah.
It was either his Llama style.

67
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,460
I don't think it was either one of those
guys. Like I know he's laughing guy.

68
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,271
He was,
you know,

69
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:56,260
he hit done and a guy in a suit
that heritage is Russian manager.

70
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:01,420
He hit Dylan either way. Um, but actually
indicates when your mind is went in and,

71
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,230
and hit him from behind. Yeah. You
know, I can't, I can't understand that.

72
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:10,060
Like I said, for, for, for Habib, I didn't
think it was, you know, it was, it's just,

73
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:14,130
it's almost, it's such a foolish thing
to do. [inaudible] to date already. One,

74
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,610
I know that Dylan was talking shit and
he was angry but like actually didn't say

75
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:21,730
anything because I heard a
few people signed up. Now I
was standing beside Dylan.

76
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,860
I didn't see what he did but I could hear.

77
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,840
So he didn't say anything
now and I watched the back.

78
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:30,430
I see any kind of beckoned them on, you
know, just stupid end the fight stuff.

79
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:34,300
But I didn't think it justified that
level of response then maybe there was

80
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:35,590
something else in the lead up.
You know,

81
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,790
probably dealing is a bit
of a troll online. So uh,

82
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,960
there was probably a bit of a build up of
voter stuff. But um, yeah, like I said,

83
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:48,400
it wasn't that big a deal to me. What have
you did? Yeah, just really wasn't, well,

84
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,050
there's two ways of looking at it

85
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,980
in terms of like the trash
talking and one way is that man,

86
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:58,490
does that sell a fight? I mean
it sells a fight. Me Connors,

87
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,300
one of the best ever at, if not the best
ever at a talking shit to opponents,

88
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,960
getting them riled up and me.
It is the reason why Josie,

89
00:05:05,961 --> 00:05:09,890
although lost his composure and came
charging faith first at Conner. I mean,

90
00:05:09,891 --> 00:05:14,570
you gotta think emotions play a big
part of that. It ramps up your stress.

91
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,710
It ramps up the fighters, a anxiety,
anticipation and the ramps up,

92
00:05:18,711 --> 00:05:20,660
the pressure on them to win and to,

93
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,530
and this emotion that they're
fighting with fucks up their judgment.

94
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,490
It just does. And it's a major
tool that taner that Connor uses.

95
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,360
And,
but on the other hand,

96
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,300
we'll say,
well,

97
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,240
I'd like when fighters are respectful
and this is one of the things that could

98
00:05:36,241 --> 00:05:39,720
be saying this, this, this. Uh,
sports should be about respect.

99
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,540
You shouldn't be talking about someone's
family shouldn't be talking about

100
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,090
someone's religion. You shouldn't
be talking about someone's country.

101
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,440
But you know,
on the other hand,

102
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,470
that's one of the reasons why Conor is so
fucking huge. It's not just as results,

103
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,960
it's all the other things
that come along with it.

104
00:05:55,961 --> 00:06:00,080
Is the excitement that he a shit talking
though. Who the fuck is that guy?

105
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,870
Like that kind of shit.
That's a big part of who he is.

106
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,750
It's a part of who he is
as this cultural icon.

107
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,300
I mean it's one of the
reasons why people love them.

108
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,860
I mean they don't just love
his ability inside the octagon,

109
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:15,470
which is quite substantial
that they loved the swagger.

110
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:19,310
They love when he comes in with rubber
arms and, and struts around the cage.

111
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,220
They love all that shit.
They love all that shit.

112
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,660
It's like when is too far? And that
is the question. When is too far.

113
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,610
Yeah. Um, yeah, you know, Connor
is a real ad divider. You know,

114
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,540
if some people will love
it and some people hate it,

115
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,570
I'm not really that interested
in people's opinions on things.

116
00:06:36,571 --> 00:06:41,550
I'm just interested in what is
and what is that sells fights.

117
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:46,620
There's a reason he's the highest
paid guy. Um, so if that is what is,

118
00:06:46,621 --> 00:06:50,480
and that's just natural for him to do as
well. It's not an act. It's not, you know,

119
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,330
when he's sparring, I am an art. Them are
best of friends on every single sparity.

120
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,400
She's talking to her,
your shit today. You know,

121
00:06:56,401 --> 00:06:58,350
you know what I'm forum today
and they're gonna, you know,

122
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:01,680
people listen to them like they hate each
other and then speak smiles at the end

123
00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:04,860
of it. It's just part of the game
for him. It's probably enjoys it.

124
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:09,540
It's a bit of fun. This one was dark
or you know, as, as, as Dana said,

125
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:12,060
it definitely was,
but it's just part of who he is.

126
00:07:12,061 --> 00:07:13,710
I don't really involve myself in it.

127
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:18,960
I tried to stay outside of that and
then just focus on the task at hand.

128
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,340
Ever get cringey for you because
you are a very respectful guy. Yeah.

129
00:07:23,341 --> 00:07:26,700
I mean it's absolutely not my personality.
It's absolutely not my personality.

130
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,120
But again, I don't find my own
opinions on things. Very interesting.

131
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:34,080
I'm only interested in,
um, what is, you know,

132
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:39,240
there's a fact that he does this
and it's got an, the results he has.

133
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:44,400
Okay. Well, I guess that's what he
does. It's not how I am. Right. I mean,

134
00:07:44,401 --> 00:07:47,340
you look at the two biggest
names in combat sports,

135
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:50,250
Floyd Mayweather and Conor
McGregor and they both do it. Yeah.

136
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,570
My favorite fighter back in
the day was fate or, and it,

137
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,320
there was a non that barely said anything
and the purest if you want to say

138
00:07:58,321 --> 00:08:02,700
loved him, but he was also fighting
mostly in Japan. It's different vibe.

139
00:08:02,701 --> 00:08:06,450
It's a different culture than here.
Um, you know, you could beat that guy.

140
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:10,530
And I almost have the two extremes I've
got to Nelson who you never hear a blip

141
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:14,010
out of. Yes. And then I have Connor who
was, you know, the other end of the scale.

142
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:19,330
And um, you know, you can only be true
to yourself, but at I look at their,

143
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:19,981
their,
you know,

144
00:08:19,981 --> 00:08:22,830
their followings and their sponsorship
deals and their fight purses and stuff

145
00:08:22,831 --> 00:08:26,920
and it's obvious which one is doing
better. You know, if, if, if the, if the,

146
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,750
if we can agree on the object, the prize
fighting is to make money and that's it.

147
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,090
The object of martial arts
I think is very different,

148
00:08:33,091 --> 00:08:35,970
but the object of prize fighting
and don't ever lose sight of that.

149
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,310
As soon as I hear a fighter saying
it's for somewhere where reason,

150
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,130
I'll try to make them retire as quick
as possible because not being smart,

151
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:46,050
you know, you're, you're taking
damage for money and keep,

152
00:08:46,051 --> 00:08:48,480
keep that in mind no matter
what your choices are.

153
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,790
Do you have guys in the gym that you see
that sort of mimic Connor? Oh, of course.

154
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:57,670
Of course. Yeah. You're, you're,
you're dealing with teenagers and, and,

155
00:08:57,671 --> 00:09:00,570
and twenties and that's, you
know, I look back at myself,

156
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:04,050
it's a hugely impressionable,
impressionable period
of your life. You're,

157
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,211
you're looking,
you know,

158
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:09,780
we see young men almost try
out different personalities,

159
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:14,580
you know, and he was such a strong
personality in the gym. Definitely. I can,

160
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,150
I can spot the 18 year old walking in
with a man bun and the zoo telling me he's

161
00:09:18,151 --> 00:09:22,260
going to be the next year.
I probably wouldn't be the same idea.

162
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,730
It's not different. But I true, again,

163
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,930
months and years of conversations,
you know,

164
00:09:27,931 --> 00:09:30,820
not telling them what to do with
conversations. I sort of say, this is,

165
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,010
we've completely natural thing to do,

166
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:34,530
but start to find your own
voice and find your own way.

167
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:37,620
And if that's who you are, you enjoy
that side, but we'll run with it.

168
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,940
If it's not who you were. Even that the
fans will see true or very quick as well.

169
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,211
You know,

170
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:46,450
the fans can see when someone is genuinely
doing something and doing it as, as,

171
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,130
as an act.
