1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,280
You know, he's, he's doing a good
job with it, but he also said he's,

2
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:04,750
he's the highest paid fighter in Beltour.
I mean,

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,920
just all kinds of like silly stuff,
you know, it's just like, dude,

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,270
is that what he said? No. So he's chill
son in a little bit. He's a dork man.

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,700
Just huge door. So he's just like one
of those things where it's like, well,

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:20,610
but when the guy's making his debut and
you are a world champion or a former

7
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:22,500
world champion at this point, what, what,

8
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:24,900
what inspires you to
call a guy like that out?

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,680
Just because I mean it doesn't it help
him? Yeah, I guess. I guess it does,

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,430
but it also, I mean I also woke up to
150 mentions on Twitter, so it's like,

11
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:34,740
well at least people are talking, you
know, at least people that, you know,

12
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:36,700
people are talking.
I mean that's the other thing too is,

13
00:00:36,701 --> 00:00:40,830
is always navigating the, the
narrative and talking about, you know,

14
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,860
getting people to talk,
getting people to talk about,

15
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:46,080
I mean over the last couple months,
the amount of times,

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,440
like as soon as could be for the amount
of people that were just talking like,

17
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:51,570
hey, you're the only guy that
can match Khabib's wrestling.

18
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:53,280
You're the only guy that
could notify as wrestling.

19
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:56,640
I mean to get yourself in the
conversation. That's what it all is.

20
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:59,820
It's all well style's definitely
make fights. And that was what,

21
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,160
what became very interesting,
uh,

22
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:05,190
after the outlier quantify where
people were looking at. Okay,

23
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,320
what about high level wrestlers who
have more refined striking. Yeah.

24
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,590
And how do they line up?

25
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:12,930
And Kevin Lee was a big one
that people kept talking about,

26
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:14,990
but you are a big one that
people kept talking about too.

27
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:20,320
Cause you were saying that you think you
could beat him 100% and him, you know,

28
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:24,810
having that fight with, I acquaint to
who he was a prohibitive favorite over,

29
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:27,810
but it went the full five
rounds. And you know, I Quinta,

30
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:31,620
although never want around,
showed some chinks in the armor.

31
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,400
So chinks in the armor showed it showed
what happens when Khabib can't take you

32
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:36,860
down. I mean, it's,

33
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,130
it's tough whenever the one thing that
you've always been used to dominating

34
00:01:41,131 --> 00:01:45,390
with isn't working and then you're stuck,
you're stuck throwing punches and you,

35
00:01:45,391 --> 00:01:48,500
and you're in, you know, you
know, he, he just, he's a,

36
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,820
he's a little bit behind in
the striking aspect. Dude,

37
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:55,830
I've got a ton of respect for the
Guy Mauler at certain times he looks

38
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:56,431
unbeatable.

39
00:01:56,431 --> 00:01:59,970
He has looked unbeatable where I've looked
at it and other people have looked at

40
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:01,770
it and people that have fought him,

41
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:03,930
that have talked that I've
liked the Barboza fight,

42
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,430
he just fucking mauled Barboza and it's,
and it's just a, it's a battle of wills,

43
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:11,010
man inside of a cage.
And it's just like we talked about,

44
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,460
I knew I could outpace people.
I knew I could out out cardio,

45
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:16,440
then I could out tough them.
You know,

46
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,380
certain people get to that breaking
point and they break and they can see it.

47
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,040
They go into their shell and they say,
I did a good job, but this one's on him.

48
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,390
This is his guys who don't have that deep,
deep wrestling background.

49
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,670
And they face a guy who does.

50
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,080
There's moments in the fight where you
see that where you saw that thousand yard

51
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:38,610
stare and Barboza is ours. We was like
it a slog. Like I can't keep doing this.

52
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:44,010
He goes into defensive survival mode
and you know when a guy does have a deep

53
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:49,680
background in wrestling and also can
strike, that's what makes it interesting.

54
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,810
And this is why MMA is such a complex
sport because there's so many variables,

55
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:56,250
there's so many techniques you can use.

56
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,890
There's so many situations where you
might have an advantage or your opponent

57
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:04,890
might have an advantage. And it's
just, we live for these matchups,

58
00:03:04,891 --> 00:03:06,490
these stylistic matchups.

59
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:11,520
So when something like that happens and
a guy like could be B has a fight where

60
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:13,300
all these questions get presented,

61
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,920
that's where a guy like Michael
Chandler comes into the mix. Yeah. Well,

62
00:03:16,921 --> 00:03:20,530
and I love like, after that fight
too, because I said something,

63
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,410
I posted a video that you see the video
me scrambling with comar really small,

64
00:03:24,411 --> 00:03:28,420
like crazy and it was awesome. And I said,
if, if a, if all he has his wrestling,

65
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:30,740
how do you beat a man? It can't
be taken down, you know? And,

66
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,070
and I got so many messages from,
you know,

67
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,390
Russian guys that just said it could be
time, could be like, of course, you know,

68
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:41,710
and it's like, um, yeah, I
mean, it's, uh, it's one of
those things, man, where I mean,

69
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:45,220
that, that fight with Eddie. I mean, the
fight with could be, that's exciting.

70
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,000
Kumara who has gotta be going
fucking crazy right now,

71
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:52,120
seeing Colby Covington getting a
shot to the interim title. He's like,

72
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:56,790
you mother fuckers. Yeah, I
know. Yeah. He's, he wants to
fight that dude. No, I, no,

73
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,910
I wouldn't, I mean, that dude is,
I mean, he is, he's a specimen.

74
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,820
He's got wrestling. He's
got striking. I mean, you,

75
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:07,510
you watch him spar or you watch him hit
myths or you watch his composure and his

76
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:09,670
confidence while he's sparring
and do all that kind of stuff.

77
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:14,440
You'd think he's been striking since he
was 11 years old. He just started after,

78
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,260
after college, you know. Well, he had
his good, tough fight with, uh, with, um,

79
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,160
meek mill. Yeah. He'd mail
Mika whatever, Emil Meek. Um,

80
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,960
but I think that a meal meek is extremely
underrated. Extreme manner. I mean,

81
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:32,440
he's a fucking tough guy. Very
physically strong. Very, very strong.

82
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:37,220
I was, I was email me a couple of times.
I was like trying to mimic him. Oh,

83
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,740
are you in training camps? But yeah,
we're at the same time and he needs it.

84
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,211
He's done that.

85
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:43,030
Him and I train a ton together and it
works out well for me because he's a

86
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:43,511
bigger guy.

87
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:46,930
I like to go with a little bit bigger
guys so I can just continue to get

88
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:49,720
stronger and manipulate bodies that
are bigger than mine, you know? Yeah.

89
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:52,420
And a lot of people were criticizing
him for not being able to finish meek.

90
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:55,900
But I'm like, you're, you're crazy. Yeah.
That is a fucking animal. It's, it's,

91
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,180
it's nuts. The amount of people, you know,

92
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,960
armchair quarterbacks that are dead
are literally out there. Think saying,

93
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:04,810
you should have finished this guy.
We are all professional,

94
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,180
like professional fighters
training day in and day out.

95
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,210
It's not easy to finish a guy sometimes.
I was saying,

96
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:13,910
you've got to stay the fuck away from
your Twitter mentioning. Yeah. It like,

97
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,290
man Shit. Oh my goodness.
Especially for a guy like you,

98
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,560
if you do have something like
an ankle injury like that,

99
00:05:19,561 --> 00:05:23,800
that one fight and then you got to stay
offline for a few weeks for sure. I mean,

100
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:26,020
I still get it to this day.
Well, how are you training?

101
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:28,150
Are you working on your rubber ankles or,
you know,

102
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,140
it's like a couple other
fuckers. They know your soft
spot, man. They start poking.

103
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:32,320
It's good.
