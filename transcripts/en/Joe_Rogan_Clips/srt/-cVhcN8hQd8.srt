1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:05,340
Her low freak. Bitches were
kidding Eli's. We're kidding.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,060
Don't call Elis and either to
get mad at that too. Eliza,

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,360
you know she doesn't use the last name
anymore. Well, neither does I will.

4
00:00:12,361 --> 00:00:14,910
Christina is Christina pain now?
Really?

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,500
Sebastian Maniscalco was just Sebastian
now. White people getting crazy lately.

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,590
Tig Notaro has just tig.
Is that cultural appropriation?

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,870
Two's a white person do use only one name.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,330
I always forget what's cultural
appropriation. We need to
constantly be reminded.

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,590
I tweeted something today.

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,380
I was reading a fucking article
and I almost punched my screen.

11
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,140
They're saying that hoop
earrings are cultural now.

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,770
Girls aren't allowed
to wear hoop earrings.

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,700
Who rail a cultural
appropriation? Damn. Q.

14
00:00:45,701 --> 00:00:50,640
How fucking privileged you have to
be like how softly the hoop earrings

15
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:52,230
criticized as cultural appropriation.

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,280
Do you know how soft you have
to be to give in to that,

17
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,980
to give them that and how? How fucking
dumb you have to be to say that. Yeah,

18
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,970
you have to be so dumb and racist.
I think it's the,

19
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,630
it's the Israeli system is racist against
white people. Racist against black,

20
00:01:09,631 --> 00:01:14,631
but what their jungle jungle people that
only wear giant fucking hoops in their

21
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:17,160
ears.
What I read was Latinas,

22
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,100
Latinas are criticizing it and
saying it's a part of their culture.

23
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,310
It's their culture. Yeah. It's
like people are just picking tack.

24
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,230
Black people don't want
girls to wear braids. Oh,

25
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,360
corn rows can't wear cornrows.
Yeah.

26
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:33,750
You could wear like regular white
people braids, but little skinny brains.

27
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,870
That's cultural appropriation. What
about goldilocks? She was white.

28
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,920
What about golf shirts?
Are they a lot of golf for eight?

29
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,410
They shouldn't be. If we started easy
with these braids. It's green pants.

30
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,660
Here's the problem. A little
bells. All this we bullshit.

31
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,750
The entire country is a melting
pot of cultural appropriation.

32
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,030
You dumped cuts,
right?

33
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,480
That is the whole idea of having a
civilization is that you get to share each

34
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:05,130
other's food, share each other's
recipes, listen to each other's music,

35
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,020
listened to each other's jokes and
stories get by each of these clothes.

36
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,400
You know, there was this, um,

37
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,170
journalists that went to Japan and
they were talking about cultural

38
00:02:16,171 --> 00:02:16,831
appropriation.

39
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:20,520
Whether or not they thought that like
white girls like Katy Perry wearing the

40
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:23,370
geisha outfit was cultural
appropriation and they were,

41
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:25,470
they were like universally saying no,

42
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:30,360
we're happy that people love Japanese
culture. They do that, they're happy.

43
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,373
Yeah.

44
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,860
But over here you get these fucking
dummies that are just looking to complain

45
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:41,730
and criticize and just call out
everything and everybody about everything.

46
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,650
Yeah. It's a, Oh my God, I
see this. What does this, no,

47
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,780
Jeremy Lin. Yeah. So yeah, came
out with a, in the preseason,

48
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,780
I think he had dreadlocks in his hair
and a former NBA player called him out on

49
00:02:54,781 --> 00:02:58,950
it. Kenyon Martin. But Jimmy Lens
response to it was actually really good.

50
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,090
If you want to check that
out. Hey man, it's all good.

51
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:03,610
You don't have to like my hair and
definitely entitled to your opinion.

52
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,800
Actually I ledge, I legit grateful
you Sharon. It TBH to be honest,

53
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:09,761
at the end of the day,

54
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:14,761
I appreciate that I have dreads and you
have Chinese tag out cause I think it's

55
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:17,320
a sign of respect and
I think as minorities,

56
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:19,000
the more we appreciate
each other's cultures,

57
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:20,830
the more we influenced mainstream society.

58
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,350
Thanks for everything you
did for the nets and hoops.

59
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,480
Had your poster up on my wall growing
up. Oh Shit. What he said, right.

60
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:32,410
That's really classy. I'm somebody really
need to tell him like, all right bro,

61
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:35,560
we get it.
You want to be black like we get it.

62
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:40,170
But the last name is Lynn. All
right, well he's who said that?

63
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,950
The other guy who was the other guy?

64
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,980
Kenyon Martin or there was a picture
of his but it's been removed.

65
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,010
Well he's a dummy and that Jeremy Lin
guys are very classic character for the

66
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:53,320
way you answered it. First
of all, dreads or not black,

67
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,950
they were assigned of people
not washing their hair.

68
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,830
That dates back to the
Greeks and the Romans.

69
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:03,460
There's ancient sculptures of Caucasian
looking people with dreadlocks.

70
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,990
Dreadlocks were warned by the Vikings
is not a black thing because some black

71
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:11,860
people wearing them does not mean it's
the idea that this is a real thing.

72
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:16,861
That's cultural appropriation that people
go around pointing at people saying

73
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:18,400
you can't wear your hair a certain way.

74
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,380
Like we're limiting hairstyles and it's
just so many people are just looking

75
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:27,520
forward to criticizing, getting shitty
with people over almost nothing. Yeah.

76
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,040
It's just no.
The whole day,

77
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,100
the whole energy of this country is
supposed to be complete assimilation.

78
00:04:35,131 --> 00:04:35,671
Like you said,

79
00:04:35,671 --> 00:04:40,671
let's pick the best shit from each culture
and may get just American hodgepodge

80
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,860
and that's what it's about
with gentrification. You know,

81
00:04:43,861 --> 00:04:48,510
you want people to not all live in one
neighborhood and all dress exactly the

82
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:52,500
same as each other. You want there
to be a merging of different looks,

83
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,120
different addresses. Sure.
Working in different trades,
you know, they used to be,

84
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,650
if you were Irish, you were a cop.
That's it. That's what we fucking did.

85
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,120
You know,
we were cops are,

86
00:05:03,121 --> 00:05:06,960
we were soldiers when we first came
over here and like the 1860s during the

87
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:08,340
famine,
they just,

88
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,550
we got off the boat hungry and they
throw a fucking uniform on us and sent us

89
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:15,420
into fight front lines against the south.
Or You were a cop.

90
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,080
And then after that they
got into the trades.

91
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,660
There's a lot of Irish people
in unions, right? You know,

92
00:05:20,661 --> 00:05:24,260
a lot of Irish in the Longshoreman's
union, a lot of Irish in the, you know,

93
00:05:24,261 --> 00:05:29,120
the Carpenter's union. But
look, fusion restaurants,

94
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,300
what's a fusion restaurant? And you
take a couple of different cultures,

95
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,290
you combine their food and do some
sort of a unique thing. And it's,

96
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,600
it was a big thing for a while.
People loved fusion. Yeah.

97
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,950
They love that kind of food.

98
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:45,100
And now there's a ton of
people complaining when White
People Cook Mexican food.

99
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,520
Like there's this famous guy, I
forget his name, can't be that famous,

100
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,890
I guess he's not that famous,
I forget his name,

101
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,050
but he's a famous white guy who
loves Mexican food. And He, um,

102
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:02,230
opened up a Mexican restaurant and all
these people got pissed that this guy is

103
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:04,730
a cooking Mexican food.

104
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,150
But this guy has been writing
books about Mexican cuisine.

105
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:09,590
He goes down to Mexico,

106
00:06:09,591 --> 00:06:14,330
he learns how to Cook Authentic Mexican
dishes from people that live in these

107
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:16,450
villages and towns in Mexico and,

108
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:21,530
and like has a deep love and
appreciation for the culture of Mexico.

109
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,460
Ms Guys,

110
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:27,460
essentially a Mexican cuisine scholar
and all these people give this fucking

111
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:32,450
poor guy. That's his name. What is
his name? Bailiff. Rick Bayless.

112
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,790
And he's famous.
I mean I've,

113
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:39,791
I've read one of his books on Mexican
food and I've seen articles written on

114
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:44,270
them and video interviews and stuff.
And this guy is getting in,

115
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,950
in trouble with other people. When chefs
become famous cooking other cultures,

116
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:52,490
food, you don't own your culture.
You fucking idiot. You know why?

117
00:06:52,491 --> 00:06:56,900
Because you didn't create it. You didn't
invent pizza. You didn't invent pasta,

118
00:06:56,901 --> 00:07:01,370
you didn't invent Chinese food. It's been
around for hundreds of fucking years.

119
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,640
You were just born.
You were born with a certain ethnicity.

120
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:06,200
You don't own that ethnicity.

121
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:11,150
The idea that you can keep other people
from enjoying it and appreciating the

122
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:15,890
history of other human beings is
fucking racist. And it's stupid.

123
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:20,810
This, this thing that we're getting into,
we were criticizing people, you know,

124
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:25,811
based on various aspects
of culture that they enjoy.

125
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,300
It's insanity.
It's insanity.

126
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:29,801
I know.

127
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:34,801
Think about how Italians have
affected like fashion in this country.

128
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,251
I mean,

129
00:07:36,251 --> 00:07:41,230
from high fashion all the way down to
like the disco era when all of a sudden

130
00:07:41,231 --> 00:07:41,860
music,

131
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:45,820
right? We're all calling themselves Gadi
and they were all calling al Capone.

132
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,410
I mean, come on man. I mean,

133
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:52,470
how many fucking rap songs like have
godfather lyrics and just cut the shit?

134
00:07:54,221 --> 00:07:58,220
It's so stupid. It's so stupid. And
that's my culture. I'll tell you,

135
00:07:58,221 --> 00:07:59,054
you can have it.

136
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,060
That's why I love one of the seminal
moments in American culture was Aerosmith

137
00:08:03,061 --> 00:08:06,340
getting together with DMC and
doing walk this way. That was,

138
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,340
that's what America's supposed to be.

139
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:09,523
Yeah.
It's just,

140
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,480
it's kids today looking
to point the finger, uh,

141
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:19,590
the world they see and looking to find
fault in it and find fault in each other.

142
00:08:20,441 --> 00:08:22,930
And it's this call out
culture that we see.

143
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:27,670
There's plenty of shit that's wrong
in the world. There's plenty of shit.

144
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,440
And I guess this is just a byproduct of
people having the freedom to communicate.

145
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,990
I mean, I guess that's what
we're seeing, but there's,

146
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,750
there's plenty of shit to
really pay attention to.

147
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,500
Jeremy Lin wearing dreadlocks
isn't on that list. You know,

148
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:46,300
girls that wear hoop earrings isn't on
that list. It's just fucking white. Yeah.

149
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:46,370
Right.

150
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,330
Kids that wear baggy pants. So what,
so what, who gives a shit? Yeah.

151
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:54,540
To me that's a sign that they're
like accepting black culture. Yeah.

152
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,370
They want to intern intermix.

153
00:08:56,371 --> 00:09:00,690
They want to hang out together and share
each other's fashions and ideas and

154
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,130
drugs and women.

155
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:12,150
Yeah.
