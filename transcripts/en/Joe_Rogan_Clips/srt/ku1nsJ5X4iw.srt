1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,430
What about what I house sat for
the guy that own Tgi Fridays.

2
00:00:04,431 --> 00:00:07,260
He was on a board of directors.
Yeah.

3
00:00:07,261 --> 00:00:11,550
When I lived on 44 35 far way
road and Snowmass village,

4
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:16,170
Colorado,
I house sat and the guy,

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,080
the two years I was there,
he came a week and a half.

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:23,040
He came for three days and his
daughters came for three days.

7
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:25,020
They spent 2000 on booze.

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,820
They all got drunk and they left two
days later and I was talking to the

9
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,440
daughter and she's like, yeah, this is,

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,830
my dad's got houses all over the place.

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,850
He had three in Colorado alone,
like crust. It crested Butte,

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,660
Snowmass village and he has a house on
the other side to ski over there because

13
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:49,950
he liked to different types of bout it.
Jesus Christ.

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,530
That world when people get that famous,
when they get that rich,

15
00:00:55,531 --> 00:01:00,510
when they get that the point where they
live in some sort of weird Lala land,

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,920
he had a brand new jeep
delivered every year.

17
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,180
And part of my agreement was I had a
driver like 50 miles a month to keep make

18
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:15,240
sure because when he came to town he
didn't want no problems with none of his

19
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:19,770
houses. So we had a different
fucking house sitter it every,

20
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,210
and if you don't need a background
check on, you know, I listened to me,

21
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,890
I fucking grandfathered in to the house
because my buddy from Jersey had it and

22
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:31,260
his girlfriend came out to
visit and he knocked her up.

23
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,160
But the guy was difficult to get ahold
of because he was in England and whatnot.

24
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,470
So my friend just said to me, just just
moving. Don't say Dick when he comes in,

25
00:01:40,471 --> 00:01:44,430
he'll see it's you and tell him I had
to leave and shit, keep my deposit.

26
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,660
So I stayed there for like two
months and he came and he's like,

27
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:49,590
who the fuck are you?

28
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,250
And I told him what had happened and that
we couldn't get ahold of him cause he

29
00:01:53,251 --> 00:01:56,710
was in England and he asked me
for a couple of names. I would,

30
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,760
I had already lived in
snow mass for about a year.

31
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,840
I left and then came back. So I had
a couple of nights references for me,

32
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:10,590
gave me the thing and then left
and I was not allowed in this home.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,640
So part of the deal was I had
an apartment over the garage.

34
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:19,641
I could use this car and it was 18 hours
a month to be the shoveling snow or

35
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:24,951
1818 hours a month of work or so it
was essentially a shoveling snow in the

36
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,150
winter and the long in the summer he would
give me little assignments like paint

37
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:37,830
the wall or whatever I would do, keep
the trim up and ship. It was zero rent.

38
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,340
I think he paid me 800 a month and I got
to get a day job and ski and Shit like

39
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:46,670
that though I would tape
it was a volunteer fireman.

40
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,590
You're a volunteer
fireman because all right,

41
00:02:49,591 --> 00:02:54,150
so cocaine was 1,880 pounds at the
time and Snowmass and my buddy said,

42
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:56,070
give it to me for 800 and Jersey.

43
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,500
So I would go back and forth
and I was making all this on it.

44
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,670
The people found that the guy
that they blew up, they, they,

45
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,260
they put a pipe bomb in this
guy's car and they blew him up.

46
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:09,820
His name was Steven Gray Buck. He left
a big gap in this fucking drug place.

47
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,980
So I was telling him,
Oh yeah,

48
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:16,720
they killed this poor bastard in Colorado
and Aspen 36 days before he was to

49
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:19,870
stand trial,
but they could never get him for cocaine.

50
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,640
He was making 6 million every six weeks.

51
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:25,090
I spoke about this on
a once every six weeks.

52
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:30,390
In 1984 they arrested him the first
time and 83 they brought him to Denver.

53
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:34,120
They found 9 million altogether cash.

54
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,210
Then in [inaudible] 84 was when

55
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:43,210
he went. Every night he'd work out. He was
a good looking dude that kept in shape.

56
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,500
He had 20 different cars and every
night he'd give her the guy at the door,

57
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:51,640
$5 to start the car.
The night the guy took the night off,

58
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:56,740
he started his own car, they put a pipe
bomb in his car and blew him up. He lived,

59
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:01,090
he made it all the way to the hospital,
but something went so deep up his ass,

60
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,350
but it just bled to death.
Ooh.

61
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:10,150
So it left this gap. So this guy
approached him and then he's like, man,

62
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:13,970
these people are mad at yet.
They want to do business with you.

63
00:04:13,971 --> 00:04:18,070
You're cutting them out.
So I had to talk to them and they said,

64
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:20,680
listen for you to buy. We didn't,
we never do a face to face.

65
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,440
So they haven't Aspen club and they
have a place called the CEO of the Aspen

66
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,670
Club is still,
you know,

67
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,920
in those days these places were
a thousand a month to walk in.

68
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,100
And I knew a girl that used to go to the
Aspen club and she used to tell me that

69
00:04:35,101 --> 00:04:38,480
she used to take showers right
next to Barbie Benton. I'm a Barbi.

70
00:04:38,481 --> 00:04:42,880
Benton Benton had a beautiful Bush.
She would tell me every night,

71
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:45,610
Bobby Benton's got a beautiful
fucking bushes. Perfect.

72
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,960
So there's the Aspen club and the
Snowmass clubs. No, mass club has golfing,

73
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:53,950
you know, condos around the thing. It
was like 900 a month to be a member.

74
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,150
I couldn't have been a member.

75
00:04:55,151 --> 00:04:58,750
So the only way I could become a member
with my being a volunteer fireman,

76
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,340
then they'd give you admission. And so
for 90 days I had a train, you know,

77
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:07,300
go up two flights, this thing
on a ladder, carry a rope.

78
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:10,600
But basically it was putting out,
when tourists come,

79
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,850
they don't know how to
fucking turn on the fireplace.

80
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,530
So they clean out the sharks and they
put them in and then these people would

81
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:21,910
put them in a dumpster. So tentative
plan or you're doing this dumpster fires,

82
00:05:21,911 --> 00:05:25,120
that's all you're doing.
But you got access to the Snowmass club.

83
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,770
So basically when we got there was
walking to this film mass club,

84
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,960
give the girl a $10,000 but
on your gym clothes workout,

85
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,830
by the time you got back to your locker,
the coke was in the locker,

86
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,710
it was all and they were all and everybody
involved. Everybody was involved.

87
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:42,580
So the girl that worked,

88
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:46,150
it's that she was getting a piece
of weapon we had to do was her hi,

89
00:05:46,151 --> 00:05:48,820
how you doing Joe? Yeah. Okay, wow.

90
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,300
And then later on I go in the locker at
the coke would be that I'd get like a

91
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:56,590
half, eight ounces, you know, I
was no dealer and I take it home.

92
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,670
But then I started getting coked up every
time there was a fire I went through

93
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:04,050
like two fives both dumps is,

94
00:06:04,051 --> 00:06:08,510
and this is 16 idiots with a full fire
hose. I'm like, is this necessary?

95
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,120
They even gave me like
a little fire truck,

96
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:16,010
like a little Toyota truck with like
a bell on it to go to the fires.

97
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,560
After like the third
five stopped showing up

98
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,540
for two months. They could, where are
you zero? The base where he lives.

99
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,360
And I'm just starting to cope.
Get my dick sucked.

100
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,370
You want me to go put out a fire
and a dumpster? Go Fuck you.

101
00:06:29,371 --> 00:06:33,800
So they came over and took the dumpster
and then I went to work for this other

102
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:38,150
Dude Dick. There was three decks. The
Guy I worked for was Dick [inaudible],

103
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,700
Dick Kelly and Dick Boone was demand.
So I had a buddy used to go,

104
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,170
you're surrounded by
Dick Dick, Dick, Dick.

105
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:50,171
So Dick Kelly had one of those snow
companies and they wanted me to go and uh,

106
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,410
I don't know what that called Joe Rogan.
So straighten me out. It's a high low,

107
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,040
that's shovel snow. What's
a high low, high low boy?

108
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:03,140
And the warehouse was, oh shit.
Ball truck pushed it snow around.

109
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,390
So he was another poor bastard that
made a mistake and hired me that winter.

110
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,590
And yeah, I had to be that fought
in the morning. Four in the morning.

111
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:13,460
I'm on my second grandmother blow. He'd
be in front of my house beeping. Bam.

112
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,930
I'm going to go fuck herself.
I'm not working tonight.

113
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,980
He came and took his truck.
I was on a roll up then.

114
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,550
It's not a fucking row for like

115
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,020
plowed snow guys who had snow trucks when
it would snow out. Man, that was the,

116
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:31,730
you aren't getting any sleep.
Uh,

117
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,690
there was a bunch of guys that I knew
in Colorado on shop Boston from Boston.

118
00:07:35,691 --> 00:07:39,440
Yeah, that's, that's, that's
a business. It's a business
in the wintertime. You know,

119
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:40,450
as soon as you get snow,

120
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,270
most people start to fucking get unhappy
and people would look out the window

121
00:07:44,271 --> 00:07:49,271
with the coffee and making sure you're
out there with the truck up the driveway,

122
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,270
pushing snow around. My
Buddy Jimmy, he had a,

123
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,510
there was one of his side businesses. He
was an electrician, the side business.

124
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,130
He had a,

125
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:02,030
he had a plow on his pickup truck
and we just fucking plow people out.

126
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,860
Do People's driveways. You know,
it's, I was, I went home this year,

127
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,910
March 20th I went home to Jersey.
I had to do is show one night or Nyack

128
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,910
and me and Arya hooked up
in the city way that a bull.

129
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:18,270
We walked around the city and the snow
had just started to snow. You know, and I,

130
00:08:18,271 --> 00:08:21,260
by the time I got up the next morning,
it's no like a foot.

131
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:25,940
I'd never seen anything like that. Like
when I was a kid in jersey, if it snowed,

132
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:30,440
that shit was there.
Like that shit stayed for state dance.

133
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:34,160
There was no school stacked up
on the side of the sidewalk.

134
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,080
Nerdy snow from my town won't let up.

135
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:41,370
Fucking ounce of Snow Lan,
not an inch. Really bad.

136
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:45,250
Fucking tremendous that night the
roads would clean. He's color.

137
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:50,650
I'll never forget how when I left
Jersey and 83 like if it snowed,

138
00:08:52,161 --> 00:08:54,770
like let's say if it's snowed and
had had to take the bus up here,

139
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,570
I would just call you and say Joe,

140
00:08:56,571 --> 00:09:00,570
which smelling and you'd
expect me at 11 and you know,

141
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:02,940
everything was late whenever
it snowed in Jersey.

142
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,800
He has this big metropolitan area in
New York City and it snowed that cripple

143
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:11,520
the city. They didn't know how
to hand newspapers wouldn't come.

144
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,040
People get pissed off the New York Post.

145
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:19,890
I remember moving to Snowmass and getting
a job at aspen electric and that meant

146
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,070
I had to get on a bus in Snowmass,
go to the bottom of the hill,

147
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:26,070
transfer and shoot the bus to Snowmass.

148
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,430
I did this and I remember
the first time we got,

149
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,950
I woke up one day and you know in
Colorado you wake up one morning,

150
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,160
this 12 inches, it's just
another day. Just another day.

151
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:40,250
And I remember the 1983 they
couldn't fucking clean up New York,

152
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,550
but I'll never forget that morning
waking up and ask him like at six 30 and

153
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:45,600
Snowmass and going,

154
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,560
they're not going to expect me to about
10 and I walked in there at 10 the

155
00:09:50,561 --> 00:09:54,540
people like, what the fuck have you
been? And I'm like, it snowed out.

156
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,950
The buses are running late.
They go,

157
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,340
everybody else here came out of the
bus and they all got here on time.

158
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:04,440
They fucking busted me right out like
Colorado was that far ahead of the game?

159
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,320
Well, they're just so
used to it. It was so,

160
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:12,350
but like here I was living in this
big metropolitan city that four inches

161
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:13,500
crippled.
