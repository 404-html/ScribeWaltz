1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,300
No, that privacy always comes
up. People always talk about it.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,600
And I guess I keep going back
to my same point, which was I,

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,450
I don't see people like with pitchforks
and torches going down a complaint of

4
00:00:11,931 --> 00:00:13,460
Jeff Bezos that right.
You know,

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,260
Amazon's collecting massive
amounts of data or you know,

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,530
t mobile and sprint and all these are
our mapping our locations as we move

7
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:21,570
around. I just don't see it. I mean,

8
00:00:21,571 --> 00:00:24,600
that probably raised nobody's
interest for the most part. You know,

9
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:28,800
that article that you just pulled
up. Um, and I, I, you know,

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,840
I guess in part it's because we, again,
we, we become kind of used to it,

11
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,840
custom to it, so, so fine. But, you know,
what should we be worried about? Well,

12
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:37,661
I tell you what we should,
boy,

13
00:00:37,661 --> 00:00:42,661
what up mostly is a state
sponsored activity by countries
whose interests almost

14
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:47,640
never aligned with ours now would include,
China certainly includes Russia.

15
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,990
Who was Iran, the shit that
they're doing. China has a,

16
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,320
a policy, um, information
domination, right?

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,030
Which means they've
determined that the next war,

18
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,120
the next modern large scale war is going
to be one by whoever has control over

19
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:09,090
information. So where are they
putting all their resources?

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,550
China knows that they're not going to
build a military that's going to be able

21
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:14,010
to reach around the globe for the
most part. Although they're, you know,

22
00:01:14,011 --> 00:01:16,200
they're beefing up their resources.
What are they doing?

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,380
It's cyber and it's space, right?
So I know a lot of people were,

24
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:23,490
were kicking the precedent in the ass
and laughing about the space for us

25
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:27,510
because it is funny, right? But
the uniforms be amazing. But they,

26
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,560
they talk about this,

27
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,330
but China honestly believes and it's
putting their resources into cyber and to

28
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:34,820
space. What does that mean, wolf?

29
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,490
They're anti satellite technology that
they've been developing and working on

30
00:01:38,491 --> 00:01:39,480
and continue to work on.

31
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,350
The whole point of that is to take
control of communications and surveillance

32
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:44,160
abilities,

33
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,300
whether it's ours or our allies in the
event of something major that happens.

34
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:53,100
So they would have the ability to shut
off our SoundLens. No. And if you do that,

35
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:54,750
then what does that mean? Well,
that means you're blind. Right.

36
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,480
And will suddenly walking around
with campuses and maps, you know,

37
00:01:57,481 --> 00:02:00,060
trying to shoot an asthma, then
figuring out where the hell, you know,

38
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:04,230
the target is.
So China is currently developing that,

39
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:06,900
or they have developed something
that they're working on it now. Yeah.

40
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:09,040
They're working on it now. That developed,
they developed some of it there.

41
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,860
They're working to get
the next generation.

42
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:14,610
It's like every nation that has the
resources and ability understands that and

43
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:16,320
is doing the same.
It's not like we're not,

44
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,760
what is their excuse was they shouldn't
do, they don't have an excuse. They just,

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,150
they understand. They have the right to
do it. I mean, it's not like they, they,

46
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,870
you know, as long as they don't use
it right. And in an illegal way,

47
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:29,190
they have the right to develop the tech.

48
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,540
It's like there's no treaty that says
you can't develop satellite technology.

49
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:36,360
Right. There's, there's, there's the start
tradies there's the nuclear, you know,

50
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:38,130
conventions that we have with Russia,

51
00:02:38,131 --> 00:02:41,370
which is in a whole nother interesting
topic because we're right now arguing

52
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:45,060
with the Russians over over,
uh, the, the latest, uh,

53
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,710
nuke agreement that took place
some time ago. Uh, it's, uh,

54
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,650
coming up for renewal sometime soon
in a year or two years from now.

55
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,490
And the Russians had been cheating on a
previous agreement. So we're, you know,

56
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,320
now they try to say we're
cheating on the new one.

57
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,060
And so that's an interesting
thing to be watching.

58
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:06,061
But the point being is that there's
conventions that try to control the,

59
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,530
the numbers for warheads or for delivery
mechanisms, missiles or, or, or,

60
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:16,150
uh, submarines, whatever bombers,
but not for this new world.

61
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,930
Cyberspace. Pentagons still trying to
figure out what, uh, you know, a war, uh,

62
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,780
means in cyberspace. Right. You know, how
do you respond? What do you know, what,

63
00:03:24,781 --> 00:03:29,170
what's the threshold, you know, and
then what's an appropriate response? Um,

64
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,180
and so, well, maybe we'll get there.

65
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:34,330
Maybe we'll start having these discussions
and create treaties that will allow

66
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:37,900
that. But right now from China's
perspective, again, not to beat on China,

67
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:42,160
but I'm much more concerned about China
for our national security there a much

68
00:03:42,161 --> 00:03:46,620
bigger concern than Russia is. Russia
is punching above its weight and potent,

69
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,700
you know, Putin is a dick,
no doubt about it. Right?

70
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,030
And they've doing what they always do,
which is metal and democracy.

71
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,290
That's been their methodology for
ever since they've been around.

72
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,730
Uh, but you know, that's small potatoes.

73
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:04,780
They got the GDP of a small
European country, you know,
and when the oil prices,

74
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,040
you know, are in the toilet, they
really are suck and wind. So yeah,

75
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,680
we gotta be concerned with Russia and
understand that their interests are never

76
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:13,990
aligned with ours. You know,
for the most part may be.

77
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,320
We tried to imagine they were with
Syria and isis and everything,

78
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,970
but Russia is only interest.

79
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:21,640
Arrow was maintaining their
leverage and increasing it and not,

80
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:25,630
not losing their military foothold there.
That was their primary interest.

81
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,250
We mirror our values and we mirror
our interest on other countries.

82
00:04:30,251 --> 00:04:33,490
And so we imagined that somehow we're
all in this fight against Isis together.

83
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,750
Eh, Horse Shit, you know, so, so yeah,

84
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,670
China's a much bigger issue and we,

85
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:43,870
and we should be focused on that and
to some degree this administration is,

86
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:44,840
so that's where I say,
look,

87
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,910
you can't just keep complaining
and bitching and moaning
because you don't like

88
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:49,744
president Trump.

89
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,020
There's certain things that are going on
that you should be willing to say that.

90
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,750
Okay, that makes sense. Maybe
I don't like the messenger,

91
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,010
but that part of it makes sense.
Is it his personal life? I mean,

92
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:04,270
it was it because of his dealings with
China from the business world that he

93
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:08,450
understands it better,
that he's more concerned with the,

94
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,120
the imbalance of the, the trade. I
think what happened was what do I know?

95
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:18,070
This is speculation, so,
hey, but I suspect that what
happened was he came into it,

96
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,620
um, focused on the trade imbalance. Right.

97
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,770
And as he was sitting there and talking
about the trade and balance more of the

98
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:31,240
conversation from the National Security
Council and from the agency and others

99
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,410
in terms of saying,
well yeah,

100
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:35,790
this is part of the reason why and
this is the longterm effects of,

101
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,420
of their theft of intellectual property.

102
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,970
This is why in part they've
been successful in these areas.

103
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,700
So I think there was probably more and
more discussion talking about, uh, their,

104
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:49,270
uh, economic espionage and theft of Ip
and that became then an issue for him.

105
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,930
Um, but I think initially,
and still to this day,

106
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:57,710
I think the big issue is just he wants
to try to create a win in terms of the

107
00:05:57,711 --> 00:05:58,760
trade imbalance.

108
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,360
Russia seems to us here domestically
leaks, speaking from, for myself, when,

109
00:06:04,361 --> 00:06:06,300
when I think about it,
and I think about the,

110
00:06:06,301 --> 00:06:11,010
the narrative that's been sort of
delivered to us is that Russia is this

111
00:06:11,011 --> 00:06:12,270
military danger.

112
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,320
We're worried about Putin
taking over other countries.

113
00:06:16,321 --> 00:06:19,800
We're worried about Putin's power,
the way he kills dissidence,

114
00:06:19,801 --> 00:06:23,310
the way he kills political
opponents and journalists.

115
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,530
We think about China and even what
the Walway arrests were like, Eh,

116
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:33,660
no one seems to be concerned. It doesn't
seem to light any bulbs over here.

117
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,790
Yeah, no, you're right. I don't
know why that is, except, you know,

118
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:41,500
Putin is more like a thug
and he's a visual. Right,
right. And also, I mean, look,

119
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,700
he's, he's been very clear about wanting
to try to rebuild the Soviet Union.

120
00:06:45,701 --> 00:06:47,890
So whether it's Crimea and
the annexation of that,

121
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:51,040
or where they're taking over
eastern Ukraine, um, eh,

122
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,200
or maintaining a position at Georgia,
whatever it is, uh, you know, certainly,

123
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,670
uh,
you know,

124
00:06:57,671 --> 00:07:01,810
his attacks or the FSB is attacks
overseas against, you know,

125
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,860
dissidents and others. Um,
yeah, he just more in your face.

126
00:07:05,861 --> 00:07:08,320
He's like Tony Soprano. Right,
right. So you can look at that.

127
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,000
China's always been sort of this thing,
right. And Cello, China's fantastic.

128
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:17,530
The history is amazing. You know, the
places are incredible. I think, you know,

129
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,540
we should be trading with China.

130
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:22,080
We should be doing a huge amount of
business with China. We should, you know,

131
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,700
clear the decks and try to the degree
we can level the playing field,

132
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:28,210
but we should also be pragmatic
and realize what they do, you know,

133
00:07:28,211 --> 00:07:33,130
in terms of their, their theft of Ip.
And so, you know, because that again,

134
00:07:33,131 --> 00:07:34,390
that probably won't change,
but yeah,

135
00:07:34,391 --> 00:07:37,780
we absolutely should be dealing
with China all the time.

136
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,680
But I think that they've always kind
of been viewed more in more of a

137
00:07:41,681 --> 00:07:46,190
sophisticated fashion maybe because
Putin has just sort of in your face. Um,

138
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,820
and he's, you know, he's good
at it. He's very successful.

139
00:07:48,821 --> 00:07:52,570
He says he's a smart son of a bitch, but
he's, I think he's pretty easy to read.

140
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,980
Right? He's, he's thuggish
and, um, he, you know,

141
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,320
he longs for those days
of the Soviet Union.

142
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,240
So we should understand that everything
he does is because of that is because

143
00:08:04,241 --> 00:08:07,090
he's, he, he would love to
rebuild the Soviet Union.

144
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,620
And so we shouldn't be surprised
by any sort of, you know,

145
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,290
aggressive move that he makes against his,
his neighbors.

146
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:18,580
And we should always push
back. Um, and to be fair,

147
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,450
this administration,
not to beat their drum,

148
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,660
but the actions they've
taken against Russia,

149
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,820
despite the fact that you've got people
calling him a puppet of Putin and are

150
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,400
more significant than the
previous administration took.

151
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,090
Like what has he done the
sanctions against, uh, you know,

152
00:08:37,091 --> 00:08:39,940
key individuals and companies
within Russia as an example.

153
00:08:39,941 --> 00:08:43,930
Those are the toughest sanctions
have been placed on Russia ever. Um,

154
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:48,430
the provision of weapons and a,
and assistance to the Ukrainians,

155
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,800
right? That was something the
previous administration said, no,

156
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,210
not going to do that. You know, cause we
don't, we don't want any blow back. Um,

157
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,650
that's, that's a good thing,
right. That should be done. Um,

158
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,200
pushing back against them on the,
on the 2011 nuke a deal. Right.

159
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,210
And or sorry, on the, on the previous,

160
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:09,840
on the start deal prior to the 2011 deal
and calling them out and saying, look,

161
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:14,100
you're cheating on this and you, you
know, you gotta be held accountable.

162
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,200
I mean,
there's certain things there that,

163
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,610
that makes sense then that don't add up.

164
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,670
If you talk to somebody who
says, well, he's an absolute
puppet, and you say, well,

165
00:09:23,671 --> 00:09:25,260
okay, he's a puppet, so why?

166
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:28,950
Or is he doing certain things that
seemed counter to Russian interests?

167
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,100
And they'll say, well, because
he's smart and he's like,

168
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,130
he doesn't want to get caught out.
I didn't see it. He's playing,

169
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,870
he's playing a long game here,
you know, and he's, and, and,
and I'm thinking, okay, I,

170
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:43,170
you know, maybe, maybe, who
knows? But, uh, I haven't,

171
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,310
I haven't strapped on my tin foil hat
yet to get to that point. So I dunno.

172
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,650
I Dunno. Yeah, that seems
like a complicated one.

173
00:09:49,651 --> 00:09:53,970
If they have some compromising information
about them, that was always the fear,

174
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:57,720
right. Is that they knew something or,
yeah, maybe it was business dealings.

175
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,560
Maybe it was people peeing on him or,
yeah. So I'll get them if they had,

176
00:10:01,561 --> 00:10:05,070
if they did not. And again, anything
I can help now in today's world,

177
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,430
anything's possible. Right, right.

178
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:11,180
And I wish we had somebody else in there
who was more elegant and eloquent and

179
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,530
sophisticated as anybody stand out.
Uh,

180
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,800
not right now.
No.
