1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,540
The joe rogan experience go shows. You
got more notes. How do I smelled it?

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,730
I just wanted to finish
that thing about MMA. Um,

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,270
I want to ask you about
little tag. Yeah. Who Was it?

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,760
I did that for Jamie little,

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,510
a nine year old shit talker who flashes
money and it talks about her, uh,

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,900
Bentleys and rolls Royces for nine
years old and years old. It's fake.

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:26,130
She's her parents talk her
into it. So, so, but anyway,

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,460
MMA for me is a music modern
modernization act. Okay.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,740
So about five, about five, six
years ago, Dean will uphold,

10
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:38,640
and I just started looking at that and
she's beautiful blonde lawyer, woman,

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,890
great woman, very smart, very intelligent.

12
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,300
Speaks over here at Brandeis or somewhere.
She's my lawyer,

13
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,830
was my manager for the longest time,

14
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:51,110
but she and I decided to go to Washington
has started flashing this shit around

15
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,620
saying, you know, what's fair and what's
not? Why or musician is not getting paid.

16
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,330
Right. So I just thought
MMA, it's the same thing.

17
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,480
Music modernization. So I won't forget
this. I sometimes forget it cause my,

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,310
you know, I forget. So to
attain fair market value,

19
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:13,020
royalty rates and treatment for music
creators in the digital era. The GJ,

20
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,950
the digital era right now is where if I,

21
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,170
they can play my music because
it's digital over air. You know,

22
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,270
Spotify and Adam could pay the
artists. Fuck me, I got enough money.

23
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,600
I'm the happiest guy who came along.
I got kids.

24
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:31,110
I go to sleep fucking
with a smile on my face.

25
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,150
I get to do Joe fucking Rogan.
Well,

26
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,610
I'm happy you just recognize a band name,
full name Aerosmith with Joe Perry.

27
00:01:38,611 --> 00:01:41,820
I'm happy as can be right,
but I look at these poor fucks victim.

28
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,470
You got to hear this well today too. They
get, they have to give up merchandise.

29
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,970
They have to give up a piece
of their concert sales. Oh,

30
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,180
they have to give up
everything. Well, yeah,

31
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,330
that's what's going on because there's
no more money in actual records sale.

32
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,690
It's called a 24 seven or some kind of
bullshit was that crazy thing where they

33
00:01:57,691 --> 00:02:00,390
have a piece of everything because
managers see it and they want your money.

34
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,720
Well, they also realize that
their avenue of revenue was gone.

35
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,200
So then they locked onto merchandise.
They locked on to ticket sales,

36
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,450
which used to be all yours, right? Yep.

37
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,550
Like when you used to do
concerts back in the day,

38
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,040
you used to get paid for your record.
And even if you got fucked over,

39
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,480
you got some money from the record,

40
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,780
but then you would get all the money
for the concerts. Right? But, but well,

41
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,920
not unless we were own managers.
90 10 means we take 90% out.

42
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,990
10% of the gift goes through there.

43
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:29,340
So you make $800,000 a night
company gets it. Oh God,

44
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,890
that's different. Right? Isn't
that a different thing? Well,

45
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:34,860
the record company gets,
gets publishing,

46
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,000
you know who with all these digital
outlets, of course. And then the,

47
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,100
then the record company company decides
to give whatever's left to the artist,

48
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,480
which is usually little to nothing.
Smoky fucking Robinson. My dear friend,

49
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,870
I go up to this guy and
I go, ah, don't you,

50
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,240
but I love you seemed if that guy,

51
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,790
all these songs, phenomenal. Oh,

52
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,860
this fucking guy went to the digitals
said you only $250,000 with roof they

53
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:11,380
offered. They offered for this
for his music being played.

54
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,560
Why the last five years? Why do
they owe him that? Because he,

55
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,410
because he was getting nothing back.
Nothing was coming to him. He's gone. She,

56
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,070
the coffers are empty.
You know what I'm saying is what the fuck?

57
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,410
I'm smokey Robinson, right. I hear my
music, his music is covered by hunt.

58
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,590
Thousands of people.

59
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,120
The guy knew legally $250,000
was owed to him. Okay,

60
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,940
okay.
He was offered 12,000 and he was said,

61
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,280
if you don't like it, sewers now smokey,
you don't have that kind of money.

62
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,200
So what we've done, the smokey Robinson
doesn't have that kind of money. So,

63
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,290
so what, what? Smokey Robinson
should be just wealthy. Look at King.

64
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,540
And this is not to say he's not.
If he had no money at all,

65
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,040
he's one of the happiest guy and his wife
is his sweetest and maybe he's a town

66
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:04,240
attain something that you and I know
recognize yet or, or the mass media.

67
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,520
But he's got something, he's rich.
But when it comes to him getting paid,

68
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:11,920
actually for songs,
that's really fucked up.

69
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,260
So we decided to do a, I don't
know, I don't know where it's going.

70
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,040
I've got to talk to him.
But David is real light.

71
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,170
The president and CEO of the National
Music Publishers Association and Dina,

72
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,890
we went to, went to Washington magic,
this beautiful blonde in this fucking guy.

73
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,150
Now we're in Washington in me, you
know, saying, what's up with this?

74
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,930
This money is going right out the
window and knocked to the artist.

75
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,300
These new artists getting nothing.

76
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:42,850
So we decided to do something for
the first time songwriters will have

77
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,620
representatives overseeing
administration of mechanical licenses and

78
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,420
administration.
So someone's now,

79
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:53,590
at least not only can he complain that
there's someone watching the goes, no, no,

80
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:58,510
no, no. You do. In fact
legally owned 250,000 smoke.

81
00:04:58,511 --> 00:05:01,540
You can mirror sound
and for the first time.

82
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,720
So this is something we're
trying to get passed in the next.

83
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:09,490
Don't you think it should be
that? No, I do think, you know,

84
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:11,230
that's the reason why we're not on that.

85
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,820
We're not on Spotify and the
reason why we're not honest,

86
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,850
because it didn't make any sense.
They were like,

87
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:18,550
we want to put you on W it's going to be
great for you. I'm like, how's it? Great.

88
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,010
Yeah, you guys are going to make
money like you guys are making money.

89
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:21,844
You don't give us any.

90
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:27,160
It's that whole streaming thing is this
weird smoking mirrors song and dance

91
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:29,560
they put on, you're going to be a part
of something big. You're like, yeah,

92
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,560
but what are you selling?
All you sell is artists' work.

93
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,930
You don't have anything to
sell. Yup. And I seen him.

94
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:38,240
The artists get paid so little, so
little. So where's the money going?

95
00:05:38,241 --> 00:05:40,630
Because there's all these
ain't never fucking pockets.

96
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,170
Public companies and they're traded and
they're worth millions and billions.

97
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,620
Like where's all that money? Where's
it going? What's generating it?

98
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,330
Can you need to say to them, what if
I'm bigger than you aren't motherfucker,

99
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,090
motherfucker. Well, 19 Oh nice.

100
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,720
The laws were written. Check this
out. Do you know nine on track?

101
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:04,670
I'm like not paid attention to until
fucking yesterday. Yesterday. I mean,

102
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:06,170
you know, five, five weeks ago,

103
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,090
so we're trying to get this shit go
gains momentum and the Senate, oh,

104
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:15,000
old smokey Robinson. Powerful yesterday.
Yesterday. Jesus Christ. Jamie,

105
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,910
you're on the ball. Wow. So this is it
right here. I mean, you know. Well, yeah,

106
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:23,660
there's been some fuckery. There's been
some legal fuckery and he, you know,

107
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,980
he created magic. This
guy. I said, I said to him,

108
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,040
what do you mean? I like
you, but I love you.

109
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,740
Seems that I'm always thinking of you.
I said,

110
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:37,250
where the fuck did you come up with a
line? Like I've said to Paul, you know,

111
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:41,210
what was, what was this?
You know, he says, well,

112
00:06:41,211 --> 00:06:45,530
I was sent to New York to do some kind
of publishing thing with lawyers and I

113
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:48,290
was sitting in a hotel in New York
right before I went in and I thought,

114
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,780
I wrote those lyrics.
Somehow.

115
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,560
Him being a young black men with songs
50 years ago in New York with lawyers,

116
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,283
probably white,

117
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:05,470
not just saying he was put in a
situation where he had the magic,

118
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,400
he had the magic. He wrote a paper,
I don't like you. I love you.

119
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,930
It seems like maybe the hate that he
had for what was about to happen created

120
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:18,350
the opposite. I don't know, but
that's what he told me. He said,

121
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,920
I was down there and waiting to meet
my lawyers and I'm, I said that,

122
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,010
let me ask you is you never know when,
when Napster came along,

123
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,670
I fucking hated that prick.
Yeah.

124
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,700
You see they started stealing
our songs. Yeah. Great.

125
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,100
Take all the albums we've ever done.
Take all the albums. Nuno court and nick,

126
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,140
all the albums that fucking,
you know,

127
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,030
the rolling stones ever did
put them in a box over there.

128
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:46,010
Now all my friends can have access
to that box. Anybody can do it.

129
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:46,821
It's peer to peer.

130
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:49,940
Everyone's sharing songs
and I'm sure people who are
listening to me now and say,

131
00:07:49,941 --> 00:07:51,770
what a prick. He's fucking ritual. Fuck.

132
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:57,200
But what's happened is
it's become the norm. Well,

133
00:07:57,201 --> 00:07:57,380
it's,

134
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,170
let's be scared of norm is that people
recognize that you can't do that with

135
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:03,680
movies. Right. They recognize that if
you're stealing movies, it's illegal.

136
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:06,350
Like if you get caught
with a bit torn account,

137
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,840
you've got a bunch of movies on there
and you're letting people download them,

138
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:10,100
you can get prosecuted.
Yeah.

139
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,090
Let me ask you why so much for that
and not for somebody songs? Well,

140
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:17,950
there is a thing with songs too, but
it's just not as common. Right, Jamie,

141
00:08:17,951 --> 00:08:21,850
is that the case? Would people have been
sued for having tons of songs? Right,

142
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:27,080
for sure. The movie industry has
gone after that. You go after you

143
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:33,080
if you're doubling their movie.
It's just songs for whatever reason,

144
00:08:33,081 --> 00:08:36,290
after Napster became something that people
think that you should just be able to

145
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:41,291
get for free and then passing me on the
sick and Spotify and what's the other

146
00:08:42,081 --> 00:08:44,180
one? Spotify and what's the
other? There's another one.

147
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,480
Titles getting in trouble right now,
whose title?

148
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:49,340
The company that Jay z
and with a few other,

149
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:52,450
they're getting charged for streaming
to funding streams and not paying people

150
00:08:52,451 --> 00:08:56,640
and all that. I mean, it's just think
about some new bay. My daughter Chelsea,

151
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:58,590
she's in a band with John Foster,
her husband.

152
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,190
They put something out and it's
fucking ridiculously great. What?

153
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,260
Where's the money go? Well,
this is what I'm saying to you.

154
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:08,100
When Napster came along
and then things change,

155
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:13,020
do you think that's when the
music business really got crazy?

156
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,240
That's when they really say,
look, we've got to start.

157
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,570
We're not getting money from record
sales anymore. When the record business,

158
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,750
they can do the shit digitally. We've
got to get a piece of that concert sales.

159
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,420
We've got to get it, pick a piece of
those tickets. We've got to get the merge,

160
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,570
we gotta get everything we've got to
solidify and we've got to make it still

161
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:28,620
make it a big deal.

162
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,700
And the quick stream monies pricks
in the money grabbers from artists.

163
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,590
Just rethink.
Yeah,

164
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:39,591
streaming through streaming and streaming
seems like a more hostile version of

165
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:42,690
it. But let me ask you, who do you think
it's the money at the end of the day?

166
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,480
Somebody, executives. It goes somewhere.

167
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,590
You know when I watched this movie
called Vinyl, you see that vibe.

168
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,290
I haven't seen a documentary on whatever.

169
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,120
When it was out for a bit
and Mick Jagger and uh,

170
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,140
daisy Scorsese or Martin Scorsese,
they did a pretty good job.

171
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,850
They just got too into the characters
brain going fucking crazy, right?

172
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,870
And not enough of what was really
going on. It was in near falls, right?

173
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,160
Mick Jagger's,
Solon was called the squeaky parts.

174
00:10:11,161 --> 00:10:16,161
There's the nasty parts and it showed
the managers snort and blow and thinking

175
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:19,710
how they can fucking take this and that.
It was so easy.

176
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,390
All the money was coming in to them.

177
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,230
They were making deals with were the
nasty parts weren't even signed to the

178
00:10:25,231 --> 00:10:25,650
label,

179
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:30,180
but you hear them were assigned to the
manager and the manager had a secret deal.

180
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,160
Right.
Sony.

181
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,900
But you hear that about boxers have
in shitty everybody. Creepy managers.

182
00:10:36,901 --> 00:10:40,410
You hear it about musicians,
comedians, you, everything.

183
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,870
I hope there's kids out there
right now listening to this.

184
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:48,180
They want to become lawyers and say,
did it, it should be the wild wild west.

185
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,520
Cause these nights it could be new.
A new type of lawyer.

186
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:00,390
Okay.
