1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,110
I'm to learn about
economics and to understand,

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:05,900
you know,

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,130
the source of the problems because
anybody could just blame it on some rich

4
00:00:09,131 --> 00:00:12,620
person who's hoarding money and
discriminating against them.

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,340
They love doing that. And then
just say, oh, this solution.

6
00:00:15,341 --> 00:00:19,270
See if you blame the problems on some
rich person. Well the solution is easy.

7
00:00:19,271 --> 00:00:22,000
Just take his money, right,
have the government come in and,

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,810
and redistribute the wealth. The
W, which is another word for steel.

9
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:29,010
Take money from somebody who earned
it and give it to somebody who didn't.

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,790
But if you actually take a little bit of
time and use your head instead of your,

11
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:38,050
your, your, your, your heart, your
feelings, uh, you'll learn that you know,

12
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:43,170
that the source of the problems is
government interference in the economy and

13
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,090
that the protest should
be directed at government,

14
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:50,500
at their regulations and their subsidies
and their taxes and all of the things

15
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:55,180
that government does to stifle economic
growth and deny opportunities to people.

16
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,610
D W I think there would be a really
funny documentary if you could do like a

17
00:01:00,611 --> 00:01:03,250
documentary on the last occupier,

18
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,660
like the last person to occupy Wall Street
because it had to be like stragglers,

19
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:12,400
right. Eventually must've gotten to the
point where there's like 30 people left,

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,430
20 people left,
they one guy now fuck these people man.

21
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,900
You know, they started occupying
different areas, right?

22
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:22,230
Cause it caught on and it was all over
the world they were occupying here and

23
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:24,570
occupying their, and they
were setting up camps. Right.

24
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:26,550
They're essentially
living there. Yeah. Yeah.

25
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,850
And who knows what else they
were doing there. But um,

26
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,320
but now the occupied more a movement
kind of morphed into the Bernie Sanders

27
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,940
Movement, right? Because that's
where all those guys are now.

28
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:38,300
They were volunteering for
the Sanders campaign and,

29
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,420
and socialism is really kind of going
mainstream now because they put the word

30
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:46,050
Democrat in front of it as if somehow
that changes the meeting. Right.

31
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,040
I'm not a socialist.
I'm a democratic socialist.

32
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,290
Meaning I want to vote for socialism
as opposed to just have, you know,

33
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,800
an armed revolution. But the
end is still the same. Right?

34
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:58,320
It's still a socialism and
it's, it doesn't work. Yeah.

35
00:01:58,321 --> 00:02:00,530
It was watching an interview
with Tucker Carlson

36
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,440
and some guy's a professor
at Harvard and uh, he said,

37
00:02:03,441 --> 00:02:06,510
I'll give you the last word. He guys said,
socialism is going to win. Thank you.

38
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,830
I made the piece. I'm like, what
is that? What does that even mean?

39
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,540
Like socialism is going to
win. What is it? What does
that mean? What is socialism?

40
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,630
Well, it could win at
the polls. That's the

41
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,780
problem. It's very intoxicating to
people who don't know any better. Right?

42
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,250
And the interesting thing,
people, they have too much money.

43
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,210
The interesting thing about socialism is
that no matter how many times it fails,

44
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,620
people expect it to succeed, right?
That's the definition of insanity, right?

45
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:35,190
Doing something over and over again
and expecting a different result. Well,

46
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:39,210
the Socialists always expect a different
result from doing something that has

47
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:40,680
never succeeded in the past.

48
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,180
Socialism by definition is one thing,

49
00:02:43,181 --> 00:02:46,780
but by the emotional reaction to
people have is kind of another thing.

50
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,590
The emotional reaction is there's
rich people that are a real problem.

51
00:02:50,591 --> 00:02:55,210
They're hoarding their greedy. I'm
not concerned with money. I want,

52
00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:00,220
I'm concerned with people and community
and feelings and health and welfare and

53
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:02,920
education and all that money.

54
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:07,150
We should take it from those rich people
and we should funnel it into education

55
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:11,020
and community. And they say
all these words that make
people feel good. Like, yeah,

56
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,490
we're not about money either.

57
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,910
It's all, it's all about feeling good.
That's what the liberals are about.

58
00:03:16,911 --> 00:03:17,541
It's about,
you know,

59
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,330
feeling that they're better than
everybody else because they're, you know,

60
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:20,620
they're,

61
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,470
they're higher up on this moral pedestal
because they don't care about money.

62
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,680
They just care about, you
know, people and you know.

63
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:31,040
But when you talk about rich people,
they don't hoard money. I mean,

64
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,080
the way you get rich is not by hoarding.

65
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:37,220
The way you get rich is by trying to
figure out what problems people have that

66
00:03:37,221 --> 00:03:38,420
you can solve,
right?

67
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:42,800
Whether it's inventing something that
makes their lives better or providing a

68
00:03:42,801 --> 00:03:46,460
service that makes their lives better
because the customers are in charge

69
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:50,520
individuals, right? That that's what's
going to allocate wealth. It's if,

70
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:55,570
if somebody is better than somebody else
at satisfying the desires that people

71
00:03:56,391 --> 00:03:59,780
have, right? If, if I can come
up with something that you like,

72
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,890
that you want to buy that's cheaper and
better than what somebody else has come

73
00:04:03,891 --> 00:04:05,450
up with,
then you're going to buy from me.

74
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,650
And so the person who ends up with the
most money is the person who's satisfied,

75
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:14,440
the most desires, the most needs in
the most efficient way possible. And,

76
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,340
and that's what's benefiting society.
I mean,

77
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:19,190
it's great to have charity and
I'm all for private charity,

78
00:04:19,191 --> 00:04:21,890
but if you look at the
wealthiest men in history,

79
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,610
even though they've been
incredible philanthropist
and they've given away a lot

80
00:04:25,611 --> 00:04:27,770
of money,
they helped a lot more people,

81
00:04:27,771 --> 00:04:30,590
a massing their fortunes
than gifting away.

82
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,970
What they made it was the businesses
that they created, the, the,

83
00:04:34,971 --> 00:04:37,130
the products that they invented,

84
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,160
the services that they provided
and the employment, right?

85
00:04:40,161 --> 00:04:43,100
That was all a function of
they're creating their wealth.

86
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,840
That's what did a lot more to help society
than simply giving away some of the

87
00:04:47,841 --> 00:04:51,650
money that they earned. Have you ever
had a debate with a democratic socialist?

88
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,380
Well, I mean, most
Democrats are socialists.

89
00:04:54,381 --> 00:04:56,480
They just don't know it or
they don't want to admit it.

90
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,050
I and a lot of people
don't even understand what
socialism is because you know

91
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:03,740
you'll have the left. I'll always
consider somebody like even Donald Trump,

92
00:05:03,741 --> 00:05:05,120
they'll say, oh, he's a fascist, right?

93
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:09,380
They don't even realize that
fascism is part of socialism.

94
00:05:09,381 --> 00:05:14,381
Socialism is a broad concept that includes
things like Communism and fascism.

95
00:05:15,021 --> 00:05:18,200
So if you're a communist,
you are a socialist. But by,

96
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,420
but it doesn't mean that
if you're a socialist,

97
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:22,390
you're a communist because
you could be a fascist,

98
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,570
you could be for a lot of things,

99
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:28,750
but fascism is a form of socialism where
the government doesn't just steal all

100
00:05:29,481 --> 00:05:30,051
the property,

101
00:05:30,051 --> 00:05:35,051
like the communist want to nationalize
everything and take legal ownership of

102
00:05:35,121 --> 00:05:38,900
the means of production.
Right? The government just
owns all the capital under.

103
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,410
Under fascism,
the government is a little bit smarter.

104
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,340
They realize that people will work
harder if they think they're working for

105
00:05:46,341 --> 00:05:50,120
themselves. So the fastest doesn't
want to nationalize businesses.

106
00:05:50,121 --> 00:05:52,940
They just want to control it
through regulation and taxes.

107
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,310
And that's pretty much what
the Democrats want to do.

108
00:05:55,311 --> 00:05:59,330
They want to control everything by
taxing it heavily and regulating it.

109
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,270
And those, that's an important
aspect of fascist. I mean,

110
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:07,100
a lot of people associate fascism with
racism just because the Nazis were,

111
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,470
were racist, but you don't
have to be racist. I mean,

112
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,730
fascism started in Italy and that
there wasn't any racism there.

113
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,760
And if you go back to, uh, the Nazi party,

114
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:20,540
it's the National Socialist Party of
Germany. That's what the Nazis are.

115
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,690
It's socialists.
So fascism is a form of socialism.

116
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,470
That's why the communists
and the fascists, you know,

117
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,080
argue so much because they're really,
they're fighting over the same turf.

118
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,760
It's which brand of socialism is better,
fascism or communism,

119
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,520
but they're not at opposite
ends of the political spectrum.

120
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,540
They're on the same end.
