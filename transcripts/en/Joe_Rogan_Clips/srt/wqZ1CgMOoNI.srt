1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,470
Oh, because I know I don't want to
jump into a car with a fucking man.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,630
Listen to me. I just leave
fucking and leave. Uh,

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,810
Aspen, I owe like $80,000. I
got eight people looking for me,

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,660
the cops and looking for me.
I go from Aspen to boulder.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,470
I needed jobs. So I take a job
making Joe, I'm not kidding,

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,840
one 60 a week,

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,710
60 hours as a fucking Shag,

8
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,970
which I'm the guy that takes a car from
you and the body shop when you pull up,

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,580
takes it. And I wash it. And
then they start to body work.

10
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:40,640
And then after they'd done the bodywork,

11
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,610
I'm the guy that washes it and it'd
be do that for three or four months.

12
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:50,170
Then they'd turn you into a detail and
I passed the test and I became a detail

13
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:54,030
and $160 a week. Oh, it was
fucking garbage. I was starving,

14
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,960
starving. But I was good.
And I became a detail.

15
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:04,540
The detail of them was commissioned and
you made a hundred to a buck 50 a day.

16
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:09,470
And you know, I was enjoying it, but
the guy I had as a boss was dead.

17
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,030
His name is Dirk Jordan.
He was just a big dog.

18
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:18,330
He was one of those guys that was one of
us. But when they get a manager's job,

19
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,150
one that I'm back there washing the
fucking car and I see a dead rat,

20
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:30,030
I pick the fucking ran up and he
had his jacket hanging by the door.

21
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,240
I put the dead rat in his
pocket of his jacket. You know,

22
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:37,710
meet though. I go home, I get
stoned, I don't know nothing.

23
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,790
The next morning he comes in,
Oh,

24
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,390
and this cat car is fucked up.
Like he hit like a poll.

25
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,970
He went in his pocket to get a cigarette
and he pulled the fucking rat out and

26
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,150
he fucking just went crazy. It didn't
like a Paul. He came in running,

27
00:01:59,151 --> 00:02:02,510
I know who did this.
I'm going to get to the bottom of this.

28
00:02:02,511 --> 00:02:03,980
And he kept blaming some other guy.

29
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,040
Oh my bosses. Okay. Fuck man.

30
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,070
That's one of the worst relationships
ever. A Boston employee,

31
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,910
one of the worst relationships.
Some guy gets to tell you what to do.

32
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,610
He's the fucking,
he's the head guy at the office.

33
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,110
You got to listen to this fuck head.

34
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,620
That is one of the worst positions to
be in working for a guy who's a deck and

35
00:02:29,631 --> 00:02:33,770
that power that someone would have,
you know, if you were, you moved on up,

36
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,330
it became the office manager.

37
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,800
You can control people's future
control where they get a raise,

38
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,270
how much time they get off.

39
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,230
You can make the decisions whether or
not he allowed them to do certain things

40
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,360
was fucking terrible.
Was the wars boy that's come on be clean.

41
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,750
But all of them was boring.
Distraction.

42
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,950
What was the first guy you looked
at and said, you know what,

43
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,840
if I ever see outside of the, I'm going
to you up. I never said that. But uh,

44
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,260
guys in construction they would
get real Dickie. I did one time,

45
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:07,770
there was a guy when I was a teenager
that was talking to a bunch of shit,

46
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,280
he would hit me with a hammer.
Yeah, there was a cause he got,

47
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:17,140
he got aggressive with me and it was,
it wasn't in a way where um,

48
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,100
I deserved it.

49
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:23,250
He was just bullying me and I was like
1617 but I had already had a fuck load of

50
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:26,980
fights by then like taekwondo
fights. I was like, dude,

51
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,140
I'll kick you in your fucking head.

52
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,510
Like you talk a bunch of
crazy shit to me like this.

53
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,740
Like he was talking to me in a,
not just a way like a boss employee.

54
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,660
He was talking to me in a way where I
was going to have to quit, but I never,

55
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,090
never, never said I was
going to do anything to him.

56
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,050
I didn't like threaten him and say I'll
see you after this and I'll fuck you up.

57
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,990
I said, don't talk to me like
that cause I could fuck you up.

58
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,380
That's basically what I said.
Well but there was,

59
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,130
that's the thing about construction is
like there was a lot of like man to man

60
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,180
type conflict.

61
00:03:58,181 --> 00:04:01,360
Like it wasn't unheard of to hear about
street fights between guys who are

62
00:04:01,361 --> 00:04:01,991
working together.

63
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:05,590
They got pissed and pushed each other
and punch each other in the fucking snow.

64
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,650
You know,
dudes carrying a roofing tiles.

65
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,500
One guy knocks another guy over
or something. They start fighting.

66
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,910
That shit happened all the time.

67
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:17,410
There's a lot of the people
that were doing labor too.
We're like real dirt bags.

68
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,620
Like there's this one guy that
I did labor with. Um, I worked,

69
00:04:20,621 --> 00:04:24,250
my friend Lee Roy Rodriguez and his buddy,
they had some business partner.

70
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:27,760
They would take apart old houses
and Redo them. And Leroy was, uh,

71
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,690
one of the black belts at
the, the Taekwondo Institute.
He was a bad motherfucker.

72
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,660
And uh,
Leroy got me this Gig and uh,

73
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:38,320
I worked with these guys labor and in one
of the guys we work with lived in this

74
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,040
fucked up, abandoned building and will
not abandoned but stripped out building.

75
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,470
I mean there was parts of the
building when there's no floor,

76
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,450
it was all fucked up.
Half the walls were missing.

77
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,240
They were redoing the whole building
and taking things out and fixing things.

78
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:54,420
This guy lived there and he had a mountain
dew jug filled with malt liquor and

79
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:57,730
he would drink it warm all
day and he'd had the shakes.

80
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,380
Everything he did to do have the shakes.

81
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:03,790
He was just drunk all day on a
crazy job site where like, you know,

82
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:07,150
there's no floors sometimes
everything's all fucked up.

83
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:09,880
You have to balance when you're going
from one room to the other because they're

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,200
tearing down parts of the wall.

85
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:16,030
And this guy somehow or another fucking
slid on through drinking the entire time.

86
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,130
And I remember thinking like,

87
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:20,500
these are people that have
made questionable decisions.

88
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:22,060
It makes you want to go back to college,

89
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,190
makes you want to get a
degree when you're around.

90
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:27,040
A lot of these guys like laborers
and stuff, like, you know,

91
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,150
some of them are just like me.

92
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,700
They're just young guys who
need a Gig and they need money.

93
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,700
And some of them are dudes have been
doing it their whole live and they're 50

94
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:38,960
and they're drunk and yeah, and their
body's calling for terrible by yourself.

95
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,980
Yeah. I don't know if I want to do this.
I definitely knew I didn't want to do it.

96
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,630
I definitely knew I didn't
want to do it. Well, you know,

97
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,020
to be a carpenter is a different gig.
You know,

98
00:05:47,021 --> 00:05:50,920
like a real good carpenter that's a
skilled craftsman and an artist. You know,

99
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:55,210
you're putting together things that's
different, but the Labor Gig was not like,

100
00:05:55,211 --> 00:05:56,500
you didn't really have to know anything.

101
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,270
You just had to be big enough
to listen to them. You know,

102
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:01,400
big enough to like pick things up.
Can you go get that?

103
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,590
Go get me that bag of cement.
Go dig deep. All right,

104
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:05,420
you guys going to take nails
out of these boards now?

105
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,810
And it was like that kind of shit. You
just hung out with the weirdest people.

106
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:13,580
Matt, worst guy. I remember Joe
Rogan. I was clean from coke.

107
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,680
I was clean about 90 days. I was
really trying to turn my life around.

108
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,080
I answered an ad construction,
a carpenter's helper.

109
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,330
He hired me. I went and I first
day you had to work for free.

110
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:35,000
Worked for free. Yeah. So I
said, okay. I agreed to it.

111
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,190
I met first.
They worked for free.

112
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:41,300
I cut this stuff and you got to go get
lunch and the whole thing. Yeah. Okay.

113
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:45,890
I did it. I passed and then
the guy would say, okay,

114
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:50,420
meet me at a diner at eight
and when I go get paid,

115
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,630
he'd say, what's those hours? And I go,

116
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:56,840
you told me to meet you yet 80 it was
like no one should be or windshield time.

117
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,690
So let's say the job,

118
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:03,320
we didn't get to the job by 10
that's when you start getting paid.

119
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,250
That's when I started getting paid
and I was, you know, I was at,

120
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,480
I was really trying, I lived with a friend
that wanted to give them rent money.

121
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,950
I was trying to put away some money.
I forget what he paid me.

122
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:19,520
Then he made me pay for my own lunch.
Then one day he said,

123
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:24,950
where's your weight belt? Your, you
know, work belt. I don't have one.

124
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:26,150
He goes, okay, I'll pay.

125
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,290
You have to pay me the
for the materials plus 30%

126
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,260
30% yeah.

127
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:38,261
You're a fucking scumbag just to have
like a claw of fucking hammer and

128
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,690
something else.

129
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:43,850
I forget what it was to work for him to
worry to have your own tools I saw and

130
00:07:43,851 --> 00:07:46,160
stuff like that. And yeah,
there was always a thing,

131
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:50,690
whether it's union or non union,
you know,

132
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:54,650
there was a lot of the work that I did
when I was a kid was non union and a lot

133
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:56,990
of the people didn't want a union.
They felt like the union guys,

134
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,730
they had it easier, but it was, it was
too expensive and people didn't want to,

135
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,610
you know, use certain people. So
it's, it was like a real debate.

136
00:08:04,611 --> 00:08:07,820
Like what's better for every mile?
The union people,

137
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:11,480
you have to have a certain mind nine unit
cause that works, the balance it out.

138
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:12,920
Right.
So everybody makes money.

139
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,900
But it seems like in some things like auto
workers, they don't fuck around. Right.

140
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:20,430
You know, everybody has a story,

141
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:24,860
breaks,
glory time lists.

142
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,340
If a job opens up, how do we
get it? You got to go on a list.

143
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,380
Rogan has lone minority than Diaz.
He started nine months before Diaz.

144
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:38,600
He gets the job. You know, it's not about
knowing all that shit. Well that dude,

145
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:44,060
I'll never forget that news name and
what he did and the scumbag he was to me,

146
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,740
but I'm Fridays,
he would make me feel bad like he goes,

147
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:51,800
so how many hours did you work?
And I can go 38 he got enough,

148
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:56,970
I'm paying you for 30 and he bullied
me, this guy. But every Friday he go,

149
00:08:56,971 --> 00:09:00,990
this Friday I'm going away.
I'm going here to fuck my wife in the ass.

150
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:04,710
And he was always an asshole. And then
all of a sudden I got my construct,

151
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,120
my check,

152
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,710
I got this check I was waiting for and
one Saturday I'm sitting down, I'm like,

153
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:13,020
I'm sick of this motherfucker.
I'm going to rob his house.

154
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,320
And I jumped the fence and
I kicked the back door.

155
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,480
And he was a guy that
bought hot shit on the side.

156
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:24,330
He stole a sack of Shit.

157
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,150
And he must've had,

158
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,870
I dunno how many fucking bottles
and cases that dom bearing yard.

159
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,620
So I fucking ran up to the call and the
call my buddy go meet me at this address.

160
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,470
And I took every bottle of
dom Perignon and he had,

161
00:09:41,471 --> 00:09:45,780
and I sold them at liquor stores.
I took his checkbook. I mean,

162
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:50,250
I buried this fucking guy just by how
bad he treated me with such a fucking

163
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:53,370
scumbag.
Never bought lunch.

164
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:58,020
He was always making crate, you know,
he's always making little fucking remarks.

165
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,460
Well,
that's what we were talking about earlier.

166
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:02,580
What are your heads when a guy gets into
power, that's a piece of shit. Oh my God.

167
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:06,580
It was such a fucking show him.
Yeah.

168
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,850
I remember I had this tee
shirt for a long time.

169
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:10,800
I used to wear it and smile every time.

170
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,000
Jay Chess or some shit like that.
Fuck him.
