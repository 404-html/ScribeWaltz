1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,430
There is no pretense of consistency.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,440
I mean on that side of the aisle it's
like we're going to throw out the

3
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:11,520
following 17 completely contradictory
rules and then we'll tell you which rule

4
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:14,000
is operative in any given moment.
So you know,

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,940
I was going to throw out this concept of
the Hilbert problems for social justice.

6
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:20,130
So one of them is um,

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,510
you cannot understand me because my
experience is too different and you must

8
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:27,600
understand me because mine
is so important, right?

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,630
Or we are all similar enough
that any deviation from 50,

10
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:38,040
50 shows you the amount of sexism in a
workforce and we are all so different

11
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:41,850
that once you include women, uh,
in previously male occupations,

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,240
you will see a great benefit
because of the diversity of opinion.

13
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,530
We'll see there are all these
self contradictory couplets
that you have to agree

14
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:50,310
to.

15
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:55,310
Well that's the weird thing is who
assume that I just buy all of your stuff.

16
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,080
I think we've made a
terrible tactical error.

17
00:00:58,081 --> 00:01:01,380
We fought these bad
ideas rather than saying,

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,630
maybe we should just accept all of your
bad ideas and then show you what kind of

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,560
weird world. Yes, no, no, no, no.

20
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:14,100
You can't do that because they don't
make sense. You can't say, oh yeah,

21
00:01:14,101 --> 00:01:16,920
they make sense. Men, how do I know when
you're serious? Well, but that's fine.

22
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:19,910
Just let those through. Things
fail. But that's my point is,

23
00:01:19,911 --> 00:01:24,090
is that by showing the
internal, this is in, in,

24
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:28,260
in mathematics we call this reductio ad
absurdum that once you take on too many

25
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:29,190
different points,

26
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,300
you show the conflicts showing that
those things can't all be true.

27
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,350
There's no way in which if
I accept all of your ideas,

28
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,600
I can run anything. So, you know,

29
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:44,460
take this thing about a trans exclusion
from Victoria's secret, right?

30
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,740
Oh, you didn't hear methods. Oh God.

31
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,990
So the idea is that the Victoria secret
lingerie division head had to step down,

32
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,520
um, where there was a scandal in the
background that somebody had said,

33
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:01,290
we don't actually want a trans people
walking the Victoria's secret runway.

34
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,610
Right.
And so very interesting.

35
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:09,630
You have a company that is dedicated to
the commercial exploitation of humans as

36
00:02:10,371 --> 00:02:13,020
sexual objects for the
privilege of the male gaze.

37
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,120
And now you're angry that it doesn't
include trans into that exploited class.

38
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,640
So just without,

39
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,270
without getting into whether this
makes good economic sense or anything,

40
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,460
there's just the issue
of self contradiction.

41
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,210
But isn't that a reductionist
view of what Victoria secrets is?

42
00:02:30,211 --> 00:02:33,360
Isn't it possible that a woman can feel
empowered and sexy if she's wearing

43
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:37,770
lingerie and it's not just
to the exploiting of the
male gaze that it just, they,

44
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:42,060
that she appreciates looking attractive.
Wonderful. So take that off. Right,

45
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:45,880
exactly. So the idea is that
you're both going to say, um,

46
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,653
uh,

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
that that's a positive female empowerment
issue and it's a terrible male

48
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:56,550
exploitation as you at the same time,
terrible mountain exploitation issue.

49
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,220
Like what if a guy likes,
what if women decide universally,

50
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:03,670
they like guys who wear leopard skin
underwear and guys start wearing leopard

51
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:07,450
skin tidy whitey underwear. Well, this
is sexual selection, but it, but yes,

52
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,120
but what's the difference between
that and women wearing lingerie?

53
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,040
If with women wear lingerie and they
do it because they like to be an

54
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,590
interesting stat and they like to be
more attractive to accentuate their

55
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:21,100
attractive than the sexual self.
Objectification is an interesting issue.

56
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,800
Is that an issue of empowerment
or is it an issue of oppression?

57
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,430
It could certainly be if a woman's health,
do you take the take that all on?

58
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,890
Why does it have to be exploitation
though? That's the question,

59
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,560
but what I'm trying to say
is you've t some point,

60
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:34,120
you've made too many arguments.

61
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:37,600
There's this concept called the
principle of explosion in mathematics.

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,680
The principle of explosion says if you
can get one contradiction through airport

63
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:42,514
security,

64
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,390
you can blow up the universe that as soon
as you allow a single contradiction in

65
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:49,570
the unity of knowledge,
everything can be proven right.

66
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:50,950
So everything becomes meaningless.

67
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,720
So the game in some sense in
mathematics is frequently to say, well,

68
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,120
let's take all of those beautiful
things that you believe.

69
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,800
So you've just enunciated some,

70
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:03,850
I've annunciated some throw them all in
instead of saying what's true and what

71
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:04,684
isn't true,

72
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,090
you say are these compatible and
these ideas are clearly incompatible.

73
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,110
So for example,

74
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:16,230
one of the tricks that I use is to look
at advertising for women to women and

75
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:20,800
what phrases get used.

76
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:24,580
So if you use the phrase turn heads
the summer in quotes and put it into a

77
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:25,414
search engine,

78
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,550
you'll find all sorts of revealing outfits
that are intended to court the male

79
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:33,840
gaze. You say, well maybe
that's not really the male gaze.

80
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:38,410
Then you put it in a phrase like make
him drill and that will be used to market

81
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,244
to women.

82
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:44,730
And so this issue about can we at least
get to a point where we're talking about

83
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:47,830
the internal contradictions
of your position.

84
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,620
Like I don't even want to
get into what my position is.

85
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:55,270
The first thing that's scaring me is that
you've said so many things so strongly

86
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:57,940
and so dogmatically and this
doesn't have to be about gender.

87
00:04:57,941 --> 00:05:01,190
It could be about race, it
could be about class. But once,

88
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,720
once you've said too many
things, then I can say, look,

89
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,910
I don't see any way of squaring
all of your positions and it's not,

90
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:11,720
it doesn't even have to do with me.
Right.

91
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,620
I think that's where
we haven't gone to yet.

92
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:18,880
So you think letting them come up with
as many preposterous things as possible

93
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,470
and then once it gets to a
position where they, the,

94
00:05:22,471 --> 00:05:26,080
the idea's contradict each other, expose
that. Well that's, that's my point,

95
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:30,640
which is once you've told me all of
your principals, then I'm going to say,

96
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:32,920
great,
I'm confused.

97
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:38,050
Do you feel that I have to understand you
or that I can't understand you because

98
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,470
I don't know which is operative in
the situation. Tell me the rule,

99
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:46,180
how I decide which principle that
you've stated governs this situation.

100
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:50,410
Right.
If one last point about that,

101
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:55,810
I don't want to have to refer to
you where you say, well you bring,

102
00:05:55,811 --> 00:06:00,811
you bring me each individual and I will
tell you which principals operative in

103
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:02,960
which principals inoperative
that doesn't work.

104
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,840
I want you to list your principles,

105
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,740
enlist your mechanisms for resolving
the conflicts within your principles.

106
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,600
And then once you've done that, we can
actually evaluate what you're saying,

107
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:19,340
but at the moment it requires you as
an oracle to tell me which of your many

108
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:20,111
contradict you.

109
00:06:20,111 --> 00:06:24,710
Seemingly contradictory positions is
operative in every particular case.
