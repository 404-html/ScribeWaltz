1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,140
Usually women that want to push
this and men who are bitches,

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,110
it's like these,
these men that don't like,

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,450
they don't like aggressive man. They
don't like manly men. And so they,

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,470
they push it as well.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,740
It's because they're aggressive and
they're controlling and they want to run

6
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:17,071
shit.

7
00:00:17,071 --> 00:00:20,370
And that's cause that's the thing where
like if you really look at their agenda

8
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:23,940
when they say the future is feminine,
that's not inclusive and they're,

9
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:26,400
and they're all about, I'll make
this more inclusive. It's like no,

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,060
let us in so we can take it over
and then we'll push you down. Is,

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,680
is the psychology of the kind
of person that goes after that?

12
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:37,770
Someone that's after like power, I'm not
saying the average woman is like that.

13
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,440
My wife is a feminist and she's
in delight conclusive shit.

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,260
But like people who
are spearheading stuff,

15
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,410
like those people are wired the same way.
Like you know,

16
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,650
I mean a dominator is yes,
yes.

17
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,210
And there's going to be no room for you.
It's going to be like think the way,

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,520
like a lot of that that's
so called progressives.

19
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:59,310
Extreme left is think the way we think.

20
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:01,710
Save what we say or we
will fucking destroy you.

21
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,160
Pull up that tweet that I retweeted today.
The David Pakman retweet.

22
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,800
David Pacman's is liberal progressive guy.
This woman posts on Twitter,

23
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,850
she would never vote for a man or a white,

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,870
a white man or a white
person, white, white,

25
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,820
someone who's white or male,
he says that's racist and sexist.

26
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,290
It is.
So she blocks him on Twitter today.

27
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:33,270
She called Boston College demanding
that they not have him back as adjunct

28
00:01:33,271 --> 00:01:35,460
faculty.
It's crazy.

29
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,970
So this woman post this and he points
out that it's racist and sexist.

30
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,920
So she blocked him and she
tries to get him fired. Okay.

31
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,170
This is why that whole thing is fucked up.
Okay.

32
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:50,460
Because he's acting like white people
exist on an even plane, which is,

33
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:53,760
which a lot of people try to do.
So it's like he's not necessarily,

34
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:56,940
he's just saying that what she's
saying is racist and sexist. Yes.

35
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,780
Cause she's determining who she's going
to vote for based and tire on the race.

36
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,770
But there's other elements involved,
like the level that white people,

37
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,880
not saying all white people,

38
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:08,550
but white people have fucked
over people who are not white.

39
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,900
Forget about poor white people who they
fucked over. So you understand that.

40
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:15,060
But he,
they're both right.

41
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,980
But then like the fact that she then
takes it to the point that because he had

42
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:22,530
the audacity to have a
difference of an opinion,

43
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,560
that that's the thing now and that now
we're going to destroy you and you can't

44
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:26,160
be on this thing.

45
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,160
And then the other level of that is how
the corporate entities are cell afraid

46
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:35,820
that one fucking nickel is going to roll
out the dough because all of this shit

47
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:35,971
is,

48
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:40,800
you're just a paper tiger and till you
get the big behemoth to listen to you and

49
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:41,580
this,
all of these,

50
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,580
these fucking things from award shows
to this bullshit that someone just needs

51
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,410
to be like, listen, this guy
already apologize. This is,

52
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:52,380
this is an old fucking
thing. Or, uh, look,

53
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,860
you just had a difference of opinion that,
you know,

54
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,650
this isn't the first time you're going
to say something and somebody's going to

55
00:02:57,651 --> 00:03:01,930
disagree with you. That doesn't,
that this guy can't come back. Um,

56
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,000
you know,
and you obviously,

57
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:09,150
cause it's some shit that's happened to
you have an extreme opinion about this

58
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:12,010
guy because of the color of his skin.

59
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:15,130
It's like there's so many
fucked up elements to that that,

60
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,690
but for some reason you can't, like
if you address that on any level, um,

61
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,770
then you're part of the problem and then
not just part of the problem that she's

62
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,770
trying to get him fired.

63
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,860
She's trying to get him fired for
pointing out that something is racist on

64
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,620
saying if you say what I just says,
tried to look at it three 60. Oh yeah.

65
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,870
As much as I can, which is why I love
South Park is everything that they do,

66
00:03:35,871 --> 00:03:38,960
they do it three 16. Right. And, uh,

67
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,970
so I learned a lot from
that show by the way.

68
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,430
They look at stuff like that because
I don't fucking know everything.

69
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,610
But even just to try and be like,
well hey, you know, you know,

70
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,270
we salted them a little bit. I understand
what you're saying and blah, blah blah.

71
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,700
You can't fucking do that anymore.

72
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,860
Cause then somebody your part
of the fucking problem and no,

73
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:56,580
it's really getting crazy.
It got to the point like I've seen,

74
00:03:56,581 --> 00:03:58,250
I'm not gonna name names,
but I've seen like, you know,

75
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:03,380
a tweet from a fellow comic telling
comics what jokes you shouldn't talk about

76
00:04:03,381 --> 00:04:06,060
this topic.
It's like who the fuck are you?

77
00:04:06,061 --> 00:04:08,030
And it's like there's already
been enough people doing that.

78
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,680
You're going to do like cannibalism.
Now.

79
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,860
Have you really, you've ever
seen comics say that real comics?

80
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,530
Uh,
yeah.

81
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:22,470
I mean everybody has their
opinion on somebody fucking
act. But I mean, yeah. Yeah.

82
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,470
That's ridiculous. That's
not a real comic. Um,

83
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,180
well I wouldn't say that
they are real comic.

84
00:04:27,181 --> 00:04:32,070
They just have an opinion I don't agree
with. They can fuck off. Oh, I mean, yeah.

85
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,900
I mean
trying to have less confrontations.

86
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,320
I have sin in my life here.
That kind of shit drives me crazy though.

87
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,250
What drives me most crazy
is this bullying. What she's
trying to get him fired.

88
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,460
Just try to get him fired for having an
opinion on something that she publicly

89
00:04:47,461 --> 00:04:48,600
stated.
One of these,

90
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,660
the, somebody running one of these
things has to be like, you know,

91
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,190
and it can't just be private.

92
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,000
It has to be a public
tweet to say that this is,

93
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:02,830
it's just going too far in this fucking
thing where you have a difference of an

94
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:05,320
opinion now and they're just going to,
you know,

95
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,990
take your fucking job away. You
know, I ran into this shit, you know,

96
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:15,490
when, you know, when the me too
stuff first started coming out,

97
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:17,470
people would try to
like, you know, you know,

98
00:05:17,471 --> 00:05:19,750
you had to tweet the right
fucking thing and if,

99
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:23,410
and if you said anything sort of,
oh, it's, let's look at the evidence.

100
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:27,340
God forbid you fucking said that. And
it just became like this whole, uh,

101
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:29,910
your part of the problem.
Then they would try to take you down

102
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,160
[inaudible]

103
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,250
someone you were,

104
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:36,170
you were friends with or doing a
show with a represented by they,

105
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,290
they would try to do like
that pressure to try in a,

106
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,440
and it was just like in all he had to
say, I was like, no, I'm not doing that.

107
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,560
And then it just goes away because you
don't have to fucking leg to stand on.

108
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,920
Well also the people that are doing it,
it's a small percentage of a,

109
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,640
it's a very lean, small,
unbelievably small and the,

110
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,170
and you know comics,

111
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,370
it's like we're literally running
for office out there campaigning

112
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,820
for this election that never happens
and you're going through red states,

113
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:03,560
blue states,
you going through fucking everything.

114
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,330
And the general consensus of people is
like, like, dude, that was fucking crazy.

115
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,830
Like that.
That doesn't make sense.

116
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:14,090
But no one wants to say it because
they're going to get steamrolled.

117
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,250
So I would have an a Matt Damon,
right?

118
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,390
Matt Damon said we have
to make a differentiation
between the Harvey Weinstein's

119
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:23,990
in the world. And then someone
who, you know, like Aziz Ansari,

120
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:26,510
he goes on a bad date. There's a
big difference between those two.

121
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,330
And they attacked him and they tried
to get them pulled off of that movie

122
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:30,164
ocean's eight.

123
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,530
Yeah.
And they were acting like that,

124
00:06:32,531 --> 00:06:37,030
like killing somebody versus
stealing your car versus Jay walking.

125
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:42,060
Like literally the whole judicial
system is based on what you did is your

126
00:06:43,271 --> 00:06:46,810
punishment. Your parents do that.
Right. You know what I mean?

127
00:06:46,811 --> 00:06:51,760
You're bad was what you did. Yeah. Yeah.
That's all. That's what that sounded like.

128
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,910
Yeah, exactly. Exactly.
We live in a world now.

129
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:58,630
I have to be measured in the way
that I say that what he said,

130
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,170
you know,
affected me how I heard it.

131
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:06,400
And then all of a sudden this is just a
terrible fucking bald white male. Yup.

132
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,890
And they did they go in that route.
It's like you,

133
00:07:07,891 --> 00:07:12,540
you literally sound like what
the fuck you're against. And um,

134
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:17,020
it's, it's a, a, it's not going
to last. And I feel like a,

135
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:20,320
it's like the end of the winter and
people want to go outside and get some sun

136
00:07:20,321 --> 00:07:25,210
on their face and you didn't
like, no, no. Like uh,

137
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:31,180
taking people by the back of their fucking
neck and fucking shoving their face

138
00:07:31,181 --> 00:07:35,550
in the shit that you can't sustain
that. No, you can't sustain.

139
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,790
It doesn't work. You don't get
people to change by yelling at them.

140
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,833
It doesn't work.

141
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,670
Or You just bombing them like what
the fuck we're doing with like deck?

142
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,990
That's not all you're doing is you're
just building up resentment and more

143
00:07:46,991 --> 00:07:50,380
people want to fucking take you down.
So that's like a

144
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,780
don't understand psychology.
So what they think is this is their time.

145
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,990
This is their time to get back at.
Men does their time to yell at men.

146
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,480
This is the time to where the
future is feminine tee shirts.

147
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,720
This is a time to take their stand.
And then what did you not see?

148
00:08:03,721 --> 00:08:05,790
The women's March?
I saw a bunch of people walking,

149
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:06,810
right?
Listen,

150
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:10,710
I'm not saying the points that
they're making don't need to be made.

151
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,490
I'm not saying that their
complaints are not just, it's,

152
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,550
it's the execution of it.
Yes.

153
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,720
Where it's like you're going to go through
intimidation and destroying people,

154
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:26,310
like exactly. People's careers and
people you have to publicly apologize.

155
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,940
It's so, it's like it's
bullying people. Yes.

156
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,580
Some of the biggest bullies right now,

157
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:37,560
I can't believe it because I'm a lefty
are on my side of the fucking fence and

158
00:08:37,561 --> 00:08:41,100
you know when someone's on your side of
the fence and you're looking at him like

159
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:45,270
you sound like a fucking crazy person.
That's when you've entered like, you know,

160
00:08:45,271 --> 00:08:49,320
what was your special strange
times? Weird. Yeah. Like it's like,

161
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,430
it is strange. Yeah. It is
strange because it's, it's,

162
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,100
they feel like they're justified because
they feel like with a maniac like Trump

163
00:08:56,101 --> 00:09:00,240
in the office, that they have to do what
they have to do to change the world.

164
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,720
But you don't change the world by yelling
at people. It doesn't work that way.

165
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,290
And there's this real points to
be made is real points about,

166
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:11,160
I couldn't imagine being a woman working
in an office with a bunch of guys

167
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:13,830
trying to fuck you all the time.
It's got to be a God damn nightmare.

168
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,910
I can't imagine having a bunch of
bosses that literally tell you,

169
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:21,390
you suck my Dick, I'll give
you a race that happens. Yes.

170
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,510
Fucking it's gotta be hell.
I get it. I mean, I get it.

171
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,280
You gotta be like an eight til eight on
up to deal with that every day. I mean,

172
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:31,080
let's be fucking honest. You
know what I mean? There's really,

173
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:34,520
there's really six is out
there. It's really good. If
you've got a person to him,

174
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,750
a lot got a nice ass,

175
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:44,010
just say it. You know, it's
just like, some of that shit
is like fucking, you know,

176
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,880
it's, it's, I always viewed it like,

177
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,380
like you ever watch like the behind the
scenes of like a prison and the first

178
00:09:52,381 --> 00:09:55,050
thing every guy thinks is like, how the
fuck would I not getting raped in there?

179
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,750
Right, exactly. Women have
to think that just, yeah,

180
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,830
fucking walking down the street. So that's
how I wrap my head around to be like,

181
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,090
wow, okay. Like what they're
saying is like, cause I don't like,

182
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,680
like, uh, like a lot of the arguments
then, and I like that doesn't make sense.

183
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:15,710
It's what doesn't make sense to me is
the children of the corn fucking torches

184
00:10:16,681 --> 00:10:20,000
burning and just go like,
um,

185
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:25,680
the way that, I mean it looks, a lot of
people don't, they do that with like, uh,

186
00:10:25,681 --> 00:10:27,000
our foreign policy.

187
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:32,750
Like this whole fucking
thing is bankrupted this
country every August now they

188
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:36,390
just shut down the government, which has
just become normal and all they do to,

189
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,160
to make it like,
okay,

190
00:10:39,161 --> 00:10:43,170
is they just raised the level of debt
that we legally can take on or whatever.

191
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,960
And it's like, all right,
let's do this for another year.

192
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,660
And if you question any of that,

193
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:52,590
that means you don't support the troops
and you're a fucking piece of shit.

194
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:54,120
He need to get the fuck outta here.

195
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:57,060
And it's like so much stuff
doesn't make sense to me. Like,

196
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,190
I just saw Michelle Obama,

197
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:03,210
they had this fucking tweet of her
wearing these glitter thigh high boots and

198
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:07,770
said sets Twitter on fire with
their $4,000 fucking boots.

199
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,500
And it's just like,
you know,

200
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,800
do you don't question
where she got that money.

201
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,570
The president makes 500 grand a year.

202
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:21,450
She blew four grand and thigh high boots
and don't even talk to me about the

203
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:26,040
fucking book deal and all of that shit.
That fucking guy his first like to,

204
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:26,903
you know,

205
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:32,310
public speaking engagement things where
like with major banks and you go out on

206
00:11:32,311 --> 00:11:34,470
the road, thousands of dollars
and all these guys are like,

207
00:11:34,471 --> 00:11:37,080
fucking all these fellow Americans are
upside down in the house from those

208
00:11:37,081 --> 00:11:38,730
fucking bank accounts who did not get,

209
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:43,100
did not get punished in
2008 they all shoot me.

210
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,780
We'll talk about like people who should
have their fucking lives burned down.

211
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,240
Those people and these guys they're in,

212
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,120
they have their faces in
the same fucking pig trough.

213
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:55,330
It's the guys with the red
ties and for whatever reason,

214
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,510
like I don't, and I don't know
why. Like they get a pass.

215
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:07,030
Exactly. It doesn't make any sense. More
serious shit. Like drone strikes, more,

216
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,090
more innocent civilians were killed
with drone strikes during Obama's

217
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:10,790
administration.

218
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,101
I know.

219
00:12:11,101 --> 00:12:13,760
And that's why they're telling me you
fight and terrorism while you're creating

220
00:12:13,761 --> 00:12:18,560
more of it because all I would want to
do is just get revenge. Exactly. And uh,

221
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,980
you know, I have very simplistic ways
of how to get the fuck out of there.

222
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,750
How do you do it? Well, I mean,

223
00:12:23,751 --> 00:12:25,880
I'm not saying the air would be
cleaner cause I don't know what,

224
00:12:25,881 --> 00:12:29,390
like when you throw a Tesla battery into
the fucking ocean, what that does to it.

225
00:12:29,391 --> 00:12:30,530
I'm sure it's fucking horrible,

226
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,370
but I know that there are a one stop shop
over there in the Middle East and they

227
00:12:34,371 --> 00:12:36,020
got oil and that's it.
You know,

228
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,650
I always compare them member that kiosk
in like the South Shore Plaza in Boston,

229
00:12:39,651 --> 00:12:42,380
there was a something,
it was a place called Wickson sticks.

230
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,150
All they did was sell candles,

231
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,940
which just seemed like a really
vulnerable business or pewter pot.

232
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,080
The first they just sold muffins and
then they started doing full breakfast as

233
00:12:54,081 --> 00:12:56,570
well. They'd like a pewter
pot that just selling muffins.

234
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,050
So if we stopped buying muffins
and we got enough oil here,

235
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,020
if we switched to solar power and all that
shit and hell, the windmills are ugly.

236
00:13:03,021 --> 00:13:05,990
And I know it's probably just as
much fucking bad on the environment.

237
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:10,130
But what it does is it gets you out of
there and it bankrupts them and then they

238
00:13:10,131 --> 00:13:14,570
don't have the money to funnel through
the mosque to, to, to fund the terrorists.

239
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,590
Well, the United States is exporting
oil now, which is crazy. I mean, we, we,

240
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:22,530
we have a lot of oil. Right. And
especially through, you know,

241
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,380
frankly, I'm just saying if
you ever suggested that. Yeah.

242
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,910
Which I think I just did,

243
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,420
I think then for some reason I don't
love my country and like I'm trying to

244
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:34,960
solve it. I'm a frugal guy, you
know, I don't fucking, you know,

245
00:13:34,961 --> 00:13:38,830
I don't spend beyond my
means. And you know, uh,

246
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,530
I don't like debt and that type of shit.
I don't know how the fuck these guys.

247
00:13:41,531 --> 00:13:44,260
I think that's why the
president age is so much.

248
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:49,840
Um, well didn't get enough sleep. The
pressure you mentioned the dead bodies,

249
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,800
everything, all of that. Oh, a bitch
is knowing how everything really works.

250
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,790
Oh yeah. Trump doesn't seem to mind.
He just takes the extra Adderall.

251
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,600
It keeps on trucking. He doesn't,
seems like he's all the scandals.

252
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,810
That guy seems complete cause I think he,
he's,

253
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:09,330
he's a certain level sick
mentally that it does.

254
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,360
It does.

255
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,960
It doesn't get in. I mean,
because he hasn't aged at all.

256
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:18,010
Now granted he's got all that white
stuff around his eyes and he, you know,

257
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:19,630
I don't know what he's
doing with the hair,

258
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,210
but the hair is usually the telltale sign.

259
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,920
Yeah. Yeah. He's one of the
only presidents that, you know,

260
00:14:25,921 --> 00:14:28,200
it's like half of that
shit's probably from a doll.

261
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,800
Like who knows where that has got enough
money to do like a transplant at this

262
00:14:31,801 --> 00:14:35,160
point. Right. You can't do a transplant
on that thing. He doesn't have any,

263
00:14:35,161 --> 00:14:38,220
he doesn't have any donor area. What do
you mean he's got it all in the back?

264
00:14:38,221 --> 00:14:41,130
Doesn't know. He doesn't ever see what
happens when it flies up in the back.

265
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:43,170
When the wind hits it,
the back's all bald.

266
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,350
All because he probably did the
original plugs and they didn't take,

267
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:50,790
who knows what he's got going on back
there. He's got chaos going on back there.

268
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:55,700
You ever seen it? Yeah. I mean he's, the
president hits it and his hair flops up,

269
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,800
but you ever seen the video of him?

270
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:02,330
It looks like he's a guy
wearing a demon demon mask.

271
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,910
It's very wispy,
wispy,

272
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:09,070
like it's missing look like
look like a baby would be nuts.

273
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,450
If he gets a second term
and he shaves his head,

274
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:14,810
that would be nuts and he would just look
like the most evil fucking dude ever.

275
00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:17,570
Like that would be like if
you've got a second term shaves,

276
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:20,990
his head starts doing intermittent
fasting. Lifting weights gets on steroids,

277
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,900
drops down about a buck 90 jacked.

278
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,590
Yeah, I mean that would
be, I think a, yeah,

279
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,680
it's definitely a,
I don't,

280
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:34,870
that's why I'm trying to just
in my own little fucking world,

281
00:15:34,871 --> 00:15:39,490
I'm trying to chill out more and
I'm trying not to fucking, uh,

282
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:43,360
there's just, there's enough yelling. I
don't think that they need it from me now.

283
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,440
Let's think more mocking and
laughing then yelling for sure.

284
00:15:46,441 --> 00:15:47,940
But when you see enough of those,

285
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:52,320
the future is feminine tee shirts and
you see enough hypocrisy and you see

286
00:15:52,321 --> 00:15:56,640
enough people trying to take people
out for commenting on what's sexist and

287
00:15:56,641 --> 00:15:58,290
racist and trying to get people fired.

288
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:03,291
Like it's a time of outrage across the
board and you have to respond a little

289
00:16:03,301 --> 00:16:07,440
bit. You have to let people know, hey,
this is fucking ridiculous. Like there's,

290
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:08,880
there's a certain obligation,

291
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:13,470
especially comedians have
as a social commentator.

292
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,020
You see some stupid shit if
you're not commenting on it.

293
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,320
If you choose to go that route.
And some people just like,

294
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,980
I'm just going to let you forget your
whole work week and I'm just in talk about

295
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:24,780
a bunch of shit,
small stuff.
