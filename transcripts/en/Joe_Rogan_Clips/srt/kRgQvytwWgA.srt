1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,100
He still has his youtube account and he's
still able to, you know, the, with some,

2
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:07,980
one of the things that we're seeing
with d platforming is it's sort of a

3
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:10,260
cascading effect.
So Domino's,

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,560
Twitter takes you down and then
Facebook takes you down a guy,

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:19,950
not limbo but some other right wing
or that got like a said some shit.

6
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:23,880
And then Gavin McInnes, they taught boys,
guy took him off of everything. Yeah,

7
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:27,900
he's off everything. Yeah.
Yeah. And that's, that's
that. And with him it's even,

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,510
what was he, he's like a
hate speech guy, isn't he?

9
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:32,880
He's like fucking inciting
violence and whatever.

10
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:37,970
He definitely did incite violence in
that he wanted these proud boys to fight

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,110
against Antifa and he felt like the
Antifa people were thugs and that they

12
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:48,840
showed up at conservative events
and they threatened violence.

13
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:50,970
And then he wanted the
proud boys to fight them.

14
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,200
I actually had him on my podcast long
before any of this shit went down when I

15
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:58,200
didn't even know what the fuck the
proud boys was. And I was asking him,

16
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:03,290
I knew him as the cofounder of vice
and I know knew him as what I would

17
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:06,840
basically say is he,
he was essentially,

18
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,920
who's a shit talker.
He's a provocateur.

19
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,120
He was a clever provocateur
and it was kind of a funny guy.

20
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:16,890
Like he came the last
time he came to the show,

21
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,560
he was dressed like Michael
Douglas from falling down.

22
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,220
He had the fucking briefcase and
everything and the crazy tie and yeah,

23
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:25,110
I mean he's doing,
but he did it on purpose.

24
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:28,650
He said he's dressing like Michael
Douglas from falling down. Like he's,

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,360
he's a guy who would trick people into
coming in and talking with him on his

26
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:37,830
youtube channel and they thought that he
was liberal or progressive and then he

27
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:38,880
would,
you know,

28
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:43,000
he would basically talked him into
a corner and slash or Barry Cohen,

29
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,050
that shit or leg in a way.
Yeah,

30
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:49,350
he was doing a lot of that and there was
some of those very clever I was doing

31
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:52,890
on his youtube channel. Then he got
into this whole proud boys thing and we,

32
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,660
there's a video you can watch the
bizarre origins of the proud boys from a

33
00:01:57,661 --> 00:02:02,661
podcast that I did with Anthony Kumina
from opie and Anthony and he explains how

34
00:02:03,151 --> 00:02:07,930
the proud boys initially, we're
just a joke. It's, it's uh,

35
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,600
it was literally a joke and they did it
to make fun of a guy that was one of the,

36
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,850
was he one of their interns? I
think so. It sounds, yeah. Yeah.

37
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,800
It's kind of a crazy story,
Matt.

38
00:02:17,801 --> 00:02:21,210
And then that shit took a real life of
its own and now they're fucking junior

39
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:24,430
ticket K of, exactly.
That's crazy. They, they be,

40
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,310
they all of a sudden it got away from
him and they became an organization where

41
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,630
you could just join.

42
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,500
So all these people join and then they
act as a proud boy and they were beating

43
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:39,420
people up and all this other crazy shit.
And he doubles down on set. He got out,

44
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,260
he quit.

45
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,830
He denounced his position and he
realized that his life is falling apart.

46
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,740
He's being labeled as, you know, he,

47
00:02:46,741 --> 00:02:49,710
they falsely claim the FBI labeled
them as a hate crime, but they didn't.

48
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:53,430
But the southern poverty law center did
label them as a hate crime and suffered

49
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:56,810
several other organizations it as well.
But the southern poverty law center,

50
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:00,040
they've had some pretty crazy shit
that they've said as well. Okay.

51
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,480
There are a serious,

52
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:05,380
a liberal progressive organisation that
occasionally oversteps the boundaries of

53
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:08,800
logic and reason they,
but he,

54
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,830
what he did was start an organization
and I had a joke about about vegans.

55
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,430
My joke about vegans was the problem
with vegans is a problem with any other

56
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:21,370
group.
If you get a group of a hundred people,

57
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,560
what are the odds that one of them is
going to be a fucking idiot? Right?

58
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,150
Well that's 100% right.
If we're being like really charitable,

59
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,010
one out of a hundred is a fucking moron.

60
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,400
So if you get a group
like vegans were just,

61
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:35,770
anyone can join and you have,

62
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,760
there's 300 million
people in this country,

63
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,170
that means there's 3
million fucking idiots.

64
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,100
That's generous. And a lot of
them are Vegan. And this, this,

65
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,750
the joke was that the problem is not
the actual people with good ethics and

66
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:54,430
morals don't want animals to suffer.

67
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:59,380
The problem is you let a bunch of people
with no identity join your gang and

68
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:01,270
then they become a part
of this plant based gang.

69
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,890
This is same thing with the proud boys.

70
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,210
I think some of them probably went into
it thinking it was a goof and they were

71
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:10,060
going to go there and they
thought these Antifa assholes,

72
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,650
these 90 pound dork swinging bike locks
at people and calling everybody a Nazi

73
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:18,340
and a fascist and trying to shut down
every single conservative speech there was

74
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,430
at any, any sort of university.
These people were preposterous.

75
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,610
They were called Ben Shapiro and Nazi,
he's a fucking Jewish man.

76
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,350
Where's a Yamaka?
I mean,

77
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:31,280
it's crazy to call him a
Nazi is completely insane.
But he's the conservative.

78
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,480
They all right. And they'll all
left almost, right? Yes, exactly.

79
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:39,481
And so their idea was to have something
that would be there to balance out the

80
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:45,181
alt left and it got out of control and
so he denounced it and he stepped away

81
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:49,210
from it. Pulled with, but it's too late
because he's now what you said. See,

82
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:52,270
you don't know him,
but you said he's the hate speech guy.

83
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,600
You said he's that guy that, hey,
that's how everybody's going to see him.

84
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,170
So if you found out your sister was
dating him, you'd be like, what?

85
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,460
You're dating hate speech guy? Like that's
who he is. And he's like, no, no, no, no.

86
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,390
He's not that. It's like it got away
from him. It just, it became this,

87
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,900
it wasn't him anymore. With
all these people that joined
that were actual racist,

88
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,320
too late. It doesn't matter too late.
There's no room for that in this world.

89
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,090
I'm out the game. Yeah. Yeah. So any,

90
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,630
all these other groups hat,

91
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:22,330
once he started getting deep platformed,

92
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,440
these other groups got pressure to deep
platform him because they said, hey,

93
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,400
you keep the hate speech
guy. You're telling me the
hate speech guys on Youtube.

94
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,740
And they're like, fuck, okay,
we got to take them off.

95
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:36,130
And so that this domino effect
does seem to take place.

96
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,350
So with this Sargon of a cod thing though,

97
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,730
it doesn't seem to be taking place with
him because people are examining what he

98
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:46,060
said and they're saying,
well this is a sloppy use of these words.

99
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,890
It's not wise what he did,
but I do not think he's a racist.

100
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,900
And I don't think he was promoting racism.

101
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:58,050
What he was doing was he was
using words poorly off a week.

102
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,880
But yeah, I mean that's what he's guilty
of. But that's the, I mean that's a,

103
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,460
that's a good sign. He's not
being deep platform. Then if like,

104
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,500
like if people are taking a
beat to realize like, like, oh,

105
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,450
I don't hate gays and blacks. Like
that's, that's the point that the whole,

106
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,300
this whole thing has been a lesson in
patience and that's good to hear that like

107
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:21,410
this guy is being afforded
some patients about,

108
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:25,440
but in their defense,
he's already been kicked off Twitter.

109
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,880
[inaudible] he'd been kicked
off of Twitter before. I
don't know what for though.

110
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,530
Do you know what he got
kicked off of Twitter for?

111
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:35,660
He got kicked off Twitter previously,
so he already had that scarlet mark.

112
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,720
You know, there was already, people
are already looking at him. I mean,

113
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:42,310
he's been in articulate on Twitter before.
No Way.

114
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,500
I don't know what he had done.
He had,

115
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,520
they had determined that he had
harassed somebody. What's that?

116
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,450
This could be a new account, I guess to,
he's on it right now. Is it a new account?

117
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:57,440
Might be how many followers does he have?
13,000 yeah.

118
00:06:57,441 --> 00:07:00,730
That's probably knew you had a lot
more than that. He must've, uh,

119
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,630
I'm wonder if you started a new account
permanently banned account. Let's see.

120
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,850
Yeah, he's permanently banned.
April of 27. Oh, so it's pretty old.

121
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,640
That funny. April of 2017 is millions of
years ago now. The news cycle is so fast.

122
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,840
It's too fast. It's weird, right?
It's, it's, dude, I'm telling you,

123
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,170
when I was at the shows,

124
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:27,180
like a story would be hot Monday morning
and then Tuesday morning I was like,

125
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,900
what happened?
No one gives a shit.
