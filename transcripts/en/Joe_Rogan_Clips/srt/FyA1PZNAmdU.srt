1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,690
So now let's talk about mass
shootings. Mass shootings, right? So

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,120
get rid of gun free zones.
No one wants to hear that.

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,620
Get rid of gun free zones.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,030
If you're not going to
establish a perimeter outside
of a building where I can

5
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:17,610
go, don't tell me I can't
bring my gun in there.

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,690
A sign on the window is not stopping
somebody from coming into the building.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,510
We've seen it time and time
and time and time again.

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,100
If the guns were the problems,

9
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:31,050
we would have mass shooting at every
gun show every single day. But we don't.

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,350
Why the same reason you
pointed out why that one,

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,230
that one place in Georgia when they
said everybody had to have a gun,

12
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:40,200
crime went down.
People don't want to hear that though.

13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,310
They don't want to hear the answer to
gun violence is everyone has a gun.

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,160
No, not such a convenient answer for
a guy like you is very convenient.

15
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:52,890
So many guns you can't count. But
here, let's look at the alternative.

16
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,610
We've been living in it, right? Right.
And we knowledging that there's a problem,

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,030
right? So why are we entertaining? In the
fact that maybe that is the case, right?

18
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,260
But do you think that like
school shootings, for example,

19
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,370
do you think that these teachers
being armed and would be the answer?

20
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:13,380
I all right, so, or do you think there
should be armed security on the campus?

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,980
I say it should be multilayered,
right? Because if you,

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,780
if you really want to put
things into perspective,

23
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,410
and the NRA didn't add about this and
people got pissed off, but it's the truth.

24
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,870
Wherever whatever school the president's
kids go to, they are guarded by guns,

25
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,290
right? That school was
protected by guns, right? Right.

26
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,630
Anything we hold valuable in this
country is protected with guns.

27
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,590
No one is more anti gun than Hollywood.

28
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,660
When you hear about any sort
of crime or gun violence,

29
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,130
the left wing people in
Hollywood are the most vocal,

30
00:01:50,131 --> 00:01:54,990
the most virtue signaling the quickest
to jump on their pedestal. Meanwhile,

31
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,370
what percentage of their fucking
movies involve gun violence?

32
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,440
And if you look at the Academy Awards,

33
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:03,340
did you see the security at
the Academy Awards? Right?

34
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:08,690
You see all these left leaning liberal
actors being protected by people at flak

35
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:14,880
jackets on carrying guns with
fingers outside the triggers. I mean,

36
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,520
dogs, it's crazy. You
know what it is though.

37
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,450
It's a loss of touch with reality.
Well,

38
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:25,200
they're also insulated and
protected. Well, that's part
of it because in her mind,

39
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,490
their mindset goes like this.
Well, I have security guards.

40
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:32,190
I mean Kim Kardashians,
the biggest,

41
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,750
I did a video on that. So I had to have
his first thing that came to Vegas.

42
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:41,490
What she biggest apricot on
that. Right. Because she's a
dumb dumb. Yeah, of course.

43
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:45,820
But she's, she also influences
a ton of people. Yeah.

44
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,830
That's unfortunate. But exactly.
Steve Harvey had her on family feud.

45
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,370
They were on family feud,
the Kardashians and the West.

46
00:02:52,371 --> 00:02:56,550
We're talking about how fucking stupid
kid was. But we know this though.

47
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,950
That's the crazy thing. She, there's
no incentive for to be intelligent.

48
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:04,510
There isn't, I mean, she's good at
making money. Oh absolutely. Yeah,

49
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:08,570
absolutely. And I don't
fault her for that. Hey, make
your money. But, but people,

50
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,180
but at the end of the day, you still,
she still has access to scores of young,

51
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:19,210
influential minds. I understand that.
That's unfortunate, but it's not,

52
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,240
and we can do about that.
There isn't,

53
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,670
but other than you point out the fact
that she's a dumb dumb. Pretty much. Yeah.

54
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,850
Yeah. Yeah. It's not terrible person.

55
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,200
I don't know. I don't know the woman.
I just don't, well, I've heard a talk.

56
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:35,230
I just don't think she's really
interested in expanding your mind.

57
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,110
I just don't think that that's something
that's not benefits. But that's her.

58
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,930
Here's the thing about the mindset though,

59
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:45,670
is there are people who
we paid to carry guns.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,270
Right? I don't need to carry
them. Therefore you don't either.

61
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,380
So you're saying about her
is that she is anti gun,

62
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:54,850
she talks about being anti gun,

63
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:58,300
yet she's constantly surrounded by
people who have guns. That's a fact.

64
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,290
Absolute fact.
So you cancel this fact,

65
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,730
so then you can't turn around and tell
me that no, you don't need a firearm.

66
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,670
Right.
Of course you don't.

67
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:09,640
Just seven foot tall dudes strapped
to the fucking gills all around you.

68
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,110
Yeah. Yeah. So it, it's, it's man,

69
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,080
it's frustrating because it's like,
I get it.

70
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,670
I would love to have a dude standing
out here with ar 15 slung over their

71
00:04:21,671 --> 00:04:24,910
shoulders ready to protect me. How to
give a notice when I could afford it.

72
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:25,900
I pay for it,
not do it.

73
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:29,260
The funny thing is I still carry a
gun on me because they can't always be

74
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:31,240
exactly where I am. Right.
You know what I mean?

75
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,010
That's a paranoid way to live though,
isn't it?

76
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,820
What difference does it make you think
about it? How much does it affect me?

77
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:37,840
I wake up everyday,

78
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,600
put a gun on my hip and go out and do
the exact same thing I would do if I

79
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:42,570
didn't have it. But you don't
think about it. So in the,

80
00:04:42,571 --> 00:04:46,510
in a sense you feel like
you're not paranoid. I'm not
paranoid. No, there's no, no,

81
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:46,990
no,

82
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,260
no more paranoid than any than any person
that has a fire extinguisher in their

83
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:54,430
house. Think about it. It's a, it's like
I don't walk around like, Oh my God,

84
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,400
I'm my God, who's, who's coming
to get me? That's paranoia. What,

85
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,560
what all I'm doing is being
prepared, right? Well,

86
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,030
there could be levels of preparedness.
You start to hit diminishing returns.

87
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:07,420
Where starts to be like, it starts to
take away from your quality of life,

88
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,900
but me putting a gun on my hip
and just go on about my business,

89
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,170
that doesn't interfere with my
life enough to say, you know what,

90
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,110
and it's not quite worth it.
