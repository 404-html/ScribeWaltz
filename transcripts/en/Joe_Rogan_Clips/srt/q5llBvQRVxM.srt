00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,860
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,370
We never found that video of the evergreen
professor throwing his hands around.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,620
Oh yeah, there's one video.
I'm pretty sure it's in,

4
00:00:08,621 --> 00:00:11,290
but I need to like double check and
listen to make sure it's the part they're

5
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:14,460
talking. Okay. Cause it was getting
line and sent it to me and I had it,

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,970
they sent it cued up like right where
it is and it's, it's so hilarious.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,600
There's probably, you know what
I, it's queued up in a website.

8
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:27,930
If you Google Evergreen,
uh, at, what is he,

9
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,460
the president of evergreen pro.

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,500
Oh I'm in evergreen hand
motions are a micro aggression.

11
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,020
Google that emotions are a microphone.
They have it,

12
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:41,140
there's a website for sure that as an
article where they show the video and they

13
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:46,060
have it queued up and when it's queued
up you can see the kids laughing when

14
00:00:46,061 --> 00:00:49,930
they get the teacher to put his
hands behind his back. Well see it.

15
00:00:49,931 --> 00:00:52,540
But that's them not understanding
what they really are looking for.

16
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,180
Part of it feels like ha ha major do it.

17
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,060
And another part says that's
a microaggression. Don't
do that. Where it's like,

18
00:00:58,061 --> 00:01:00,520
if you believe that, that don't laugh
at someone for not doing it anymore.

19
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,660
What they're doing is just enjoying power.
These kids have taken over the school,

20
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:08,160
right? Yeah. That's it. Okay.
Gimme some gimme some volume. Yes.

21
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,950
That's not appropriate.

22
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:22,773
He's apologizing.

23
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,240
Walks up to the presence. Like put your
hands down. Put his hands to his side.

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,150
Yes, dude. And they're laughing at him.

25
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,950
Pastors were slaves and
your ancestors were not.

26
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,600
Your ancestors came here. I'll free
choice and decided to bring along people.

27
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,680
Oh, they're not out their own free
will to work and build this country.

28
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,950
My Dad was letting you know that slavery
still have repercussions in society

29
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:07,110
today and that is what we're here about.

30
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,210
Three for questions right in
front. Applause over. Thank you.

31
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,550
Yeah. She seems to not
know. Oh, there she is.

32
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,390
Trying to get off and what does he
do about that? He's clapping as well.

33
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:20,450
He's clapping too. He needs
a, he needs to seriously stop.

34
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,360
He's clapping too. Like he had
a really good point. You can't,

35
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:31,970
it's something we know about, you
know, just okay. The version of that,

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,440
that super liberal left is the feminists,
you know that version of that.

37
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,090
This is it.

38
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,610
There's a version of that which is
just the feminists like that version of

39
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:44,070
feminists. That erosion. Yeah.
There's like there's versions,

40
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:49,280
there's versions of masculine lists
too. Right? There's one built. Right.

41
00:02:49,281 --> 00:02:53,810
I guess is it though? I don't know. I
don't really understand. I don't know.

42
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,640
Seems to me like the alt right for more,

43
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,150
more than a lot of what
they're doing is having fun.

44
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,010
It doesn't seem like a troll. Like some
of it's like just straight trolling.

45
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,320
A lot of it is, he was talking to
us. I can't believe it. I was like,

46
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,460
can't you believe it? Well maybe
it was a job. I mean like Milo,

47
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,070
Milo Yiannopoulos. Surely
I got some so mad. Yeah.

48
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,200
Milo is so like, it's so theatrical.
So much of what he's doing,

49
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,100
he seems like he's having,

50
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,830
because I love it when they get on
somebody and he just like shit on them a

51
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:25,750
little bit.
Like at like someone's a god to them.

52
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:28,420
All of a sudden Beyonce after lemonade,
things like that.

53
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:29,410
If you shit on them a little bit,

54
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:33,850
you could get people so fucking angry
or you know, it's great. It's great.

55
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,800
It's never been a time like this art fair.
We get so many morons mad at you.

56
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,960
I love it. Um, but yeah,

57
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:48,010
but so what I've noticed is
that all of the Super Liberal,

58
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,810
okay. You know how like American sports
fans are Kinda dumb. How dare you?

59
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,390
Not all the leave.
I'm home more so than other places,

60
00:03:56,391 --> 00:04:00,730
but we're not very thought out. Rude
political like analysis isn't that smart?

61
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,520
The same way our liberal left
or feminism is some of the,

62
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,930
it's feminism in the world.

63
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:09,160
Like other ones are more thought out
and more interesting and more like just

64
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:13,960
thoughtful in general. Dude, I think you
left America became a fucking turncoat.

65
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:18,050
That's what I'm hearing. I'm
hearing a bunch of bullshit. Yeah.

66
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:22,900
Yeah. So what do you think though?
You should hear people talking.

67
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:25,090
They're way smarter than the
people we have. Like, like,

68
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:28,100
so our people are just dumber saying
this microaggression shit. Right.

69
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,780
That's us having too
much fucking free time.

70
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,320
Is that what is that is you've left
behind what's actually wrong and you're

71
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:38,320
jumping off, which is a lot.
There's a lot wrong. Yeah.

72
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,310
So like worry about that and calmed down.
Micro gets you guys.

73
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,050
It's not like there's better
shit to do so you don't,

74
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,530
shouldn't worry about what actually
bothers you. This shut and bother you.

75
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,150
You know,

76
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,970
take that same venom and put it into
something that's actually happening.

77
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,210
There's this forced, okay, but
like that girl that's circumcision,

78
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,530
the girl that set up there and it's
like your ancestors were not slaves.

79
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:01,520
We weren't proud of your mind were,
you know,

80
00:05:01,521 --> 00:05:04,450
in slavery has repercussions and then
everybody starts clapping and it's like

81
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,820
you are, you're right. But what
is the point? What are we doing?

82
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,220
Like, yeah, it's all obviously ancestors.

83
00:05:12,221 --> 00:05:13,840
Like when do we get over
this ancestor thing?

84
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:17,740
Like how many generations in do we do we
just treat people as individuals and as

85
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,220
people? What do they want? Some
people got an advantage for sure.

86
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:26,320
White people got an advantage
for sure. Okay. But it's not,
it's, it's, it's more so,

87
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,260
but it's not 100% of the time. So
if I came from, uh, from, uh, uh,

88
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,980
divorced household, I
didn't, right. You know,

89
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,070
and my dad wasn't around and
my dad beat my mom, you know,

90
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:41,140
that can be a way worse and harder
experience then the Cosby kids. Right.

91
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:45,190
You know? Right. Yeah. So it's
like, just because you're this,

92
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,100
it might make the odds harder for you,
but it's not 100%,

93
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,780
but there's an origins thing and one of
the origins that every black kid has to

94
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:54,640
face that when they think about it,

95
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:59,390
is it someone down the line was a
slave and they're not slaves anymore.

96
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,880
But that's why people who
look like him are here.

97
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,650
They're all here because someone
brought them over here in chains. Yeah.

98
00:06:05,651 --> 00:06:07,810
And there's still remnants of
that. Right. And there's some,

99
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,940
there's gotta be a weird self esteem
or a self identity issue attached to

100
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:16,820
knowing that everybody knows
that your ancestors were slaves.

101
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:18,500
And there's a certain,

102
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:23,210
like there's a certain thing that
people do when someone has something and

103
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,500
someone else wants it.

104
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:25,520
Okay.

105
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,640
You, if you have a a group
of people that's different,

106
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:32,630
it's like really easy to almost
think of them as not you.

107
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:34,460
Like that's how they've justified wars.

108
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:38,810
That's how so many people I
by dehumanizing the other,

109
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,600
you know,
and this,

110
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:47,210
this thing that has to
balance out that I guess is,

111
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,820
I guess just the echoes of that.

112
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,010
It's like we have to get so
many generations away from the,

113
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:00,510
from people being slaves and any
repercussions of it socially I cannot,

114
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,930
we have to get so far away that it doesn't
factor in anymore where we don't care.

115
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,840
Okay. That's well expressed
for sure. Yeah. I like that.

116
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,490
That kind of like calm
way to explain something.

117
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:14,060
Rarely gets put out and of course
screaming and he's yelling. You know why?

118
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:15,590
Like you're not teaching anyone anything.

119
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:18,470
The biggest problem on the left and
the right, but the ones that are angry,

120
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:22,160
the angry mobs is they never seek to
educate. They only seek to like punish.

121
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,850
Also grandstand.

122
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,050
They seem sure want to make this bigger
here and the lady's voice she was going

123
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:30,200
for audience. The audience clap
two, three times. Didn't get it.

124
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:32,450
And it was like all keep going.
She's seen Oprah.

125
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,380
She knows how to manipulate a crowd. She
knows how to get those people riled up.

126
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,500
Yeah. Well listen man, that's
part of being a person.

127
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,850
Like that's half the reward for saying
something that's right is the love that

128
00:07:43,851 --> 00:07:47,030
you get from people when you say that
it's right and they recognize it and they

129
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:50,030
go yes. So people get
addicted to that. Yes.

130
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:55,010
So they constantly do things that they
think are at least perceived as being

131
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:59,600
right and they get very vocal with things
when they perceive those things are

132
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:03,800
going to get a very big reaction for
standing up against them and it becomes

133
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:08,210
this moral high ground sort of grand
grandstanding peacocking sort of a thing

134
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,590
where they just are constantly trying to
let everyone even know how uncool it is

135
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:17,360
to do this and how wrong it is to do that.
Like settle the fuck down.

136
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,420
Yeah. Like weird, weird thing.

137
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,910
And then sometimes they'll see
something that doesn't quite fit in.

138
00:08:22,911 --> 00:08:24,110
Like they'll sit there was trying to make,

139
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,780
you know how they make rape a broader
and broader and broader. Oh yeah.

140
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,050
Which is really does think
does a disservice to ripe.

141
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,680
It does to be able to make it seem like,
anyway,

142
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,710
there was some coercion is rape where
if we talk someone into it, yes,

143
00:08:36,711 --> 00:08:39,020
that's right. And then a bunch of men
was like, oh, well if that's true,

144
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:41,810
then I've been raped a bunch of times.
This is the super liberal left. It's like,

145
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,950
oh,
we don't want to make that.

146
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,080
We were on wanting to make you
be able to evict them, so, okay,

147
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:45,920
that's no longer rape.
