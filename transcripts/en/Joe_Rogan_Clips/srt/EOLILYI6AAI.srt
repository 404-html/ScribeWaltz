1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:00,853
Where we're at now.
I mean,

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,940
I expect sometime next week
to get an announcement this,

3
00:00:02,941 --> 00:00:05,970
this bill should have been passed and
brought into the house a long time ago.

4
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,990
And, uh, you know, not the
case still. Dot. Still stalled
and everything. And again,

5
00:00:09,991 --> 00:00:11,820
it's all lobbying,
illegal lobbying,

6
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:15,710
which may or may not turn into some,
uh,

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,190
problems for Senator Don Plett. Correct
me if I'm wrong, but for a while,

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,000
some of the,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,530
some of the parks in the United States
would get them from some of the parks and

10
00:00:24,531 --> 00:00:25,320
Canada,

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,530
which would get them from Russians and
Chinese who would capture them in the

12
00:00:28,531 --> 00:00:29,940
wild. Right? So, so the parks,

13
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:33,120
the United States would say
that they don't capture whales.

14
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,210
So what they would do is marine la
would capture a boatload of wild ones.

15
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:37,970
And then once, uh, uh,

16
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,180
they would do it personally while
they would pay some Russians to,

17
00:00:41,181 --> 00:00:45,480
to capture the elections that they always
use. Oh God. Damn. Russians. Oh Man,

18
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:47,550
I'm not going to cheat at the Olympics.
They're stealing whales.

19
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,500
So they bring the whales in wild. Those
wa those, those whales have. For instance,

20
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:53,970
uh, you know, they Syrah calf,

21
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,950
that calf is now deemed a captive born
and now it can be shipped to the states.

22
00:00:58,951 --> 00:00:59,280
And so it,

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,100
so what marine land was doing was just
breeding like crazy and in sending them

24
00:01:03,101 --> 00:01:05,460
to seaworld and that's how we got the,
the killer whale to begin with.

25
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:07,970
How we got I Kaikos you know,
big trade with Belugas and,

26
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,640
and so that's what we're trying to put
an end to because all these loopholes,

27
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,260
you know,
Marineland really capitalized on this,

28
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:15,540
but they want a long time
lobbying the government for years.

29
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:18,210
I mean they've been around for 50
plus years. They've had, they've,

30
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,620
they've done all the right moves a
businessman would do if he wants to keep a

31
00:01:22,621 --> 00:01:26,400
thriving business without too many
hands sort of keeping them from doing

32
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:26,760
anything.

33
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,960
It's just so disturbing that we're willing
to just accept this because we don't

34
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:32,700
know what they're saying.
You know,

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,880
we know that they have a
really complex language.

36
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,870
We can't decipher it though because it's
so alien in terms of like the sounds

37
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:42,150
that they make.
It's not something we put into a box,

38
00:01:42,151 --> 00:01:43,590
but it's not like any other animal,

39
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:47,550
but you in dolphins and killer
whales and Wales in general,

40
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:52,350
they make sounds in it with a range
of complexity that's just unrivaled in

41
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:55,020
nature outside of humans.
And their auditory system is so complex.

42
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:58,050
When you put them in a, we put them in a
concrete pool. Just imagine what I mean.

43
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:01,930
I, I put my ears under the water and
it's loud. The filters are going,

44
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,130
you've got different
sounds. I mean, right.

45
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:07,420
Water being pushed in from this pipe and
that scream and people screaming music

46
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,210
louder. Louder, louder. Popcorn.
The audience figures. Yeah.

47
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,040
God Damn. It's a, I mean, I, I look
at them almost like they're kind of,

48
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,910
I mean, they're definitely not
human, but they're kind of people.

49
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,030
They like a water people.
It's weird. If you,

50
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,540
if you put yourself in the mindset of
looking at an animal and you're trying to

51
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,300
change your perception of
them a little bit rather than,

52
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,190
than sort of disassociating and
you'd look at him, you, you stuck,

53
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,500
you can actually see that. They're
like, oh, it's like they're people, man.

54
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:37,110
Like that's, that's just a
different meat suit. Yeah, like,

55
00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:40,880
and then you deal with killer
whales and stuff. I mean, well,

56
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,330
they evolved in a different environment,
but they evolve to be incredibly social,

57
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,690
a highly dynamic populations.
They,

58
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,980
they live in these very intimate groups.
They stay together for life.

59
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,420
A male killer whale, we'll never leave.
It's mother's side over its lifetime.

60
00:02:57,421 --> 00:03:01,100
It'll stay within about a body's.
It's entire life. Unless the pause,

61
00:03:01,101 --> 00:03:01,721
there's beating on it,

62
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:03,790
then I'll just stay out on the
outside of the pod for awhile.

63
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,920
At least they have that luxury
of escape where in captivity,

64
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:09,460
males get the shit kicked
out of them. They're a big
puppy dogs, big male. Orchids,

65
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:12,280
I mean, yeah. Okay. They're
murderous and they're killing people,

66
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:14,290
but they're actually big puppy dogs.
They're there.

67
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:19,060
I always felt so bad for candy. We had
this big male, beautiful, big bull male.

68
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,730
He was just, he was rocked his existence.
I having been pulled from his mother,

69
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,110
and this is really largely explains
why went off. You ruined their lives.

70
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,720
That's over. I mean their whole 30 on
diets, the reason they live, remember too,

71
00:03:33,721 --> 00:03:38,590
they remember going a month that fuck man,
it's just why do we allow this?

72
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,540
It seems to me like, like almost
a form of slavery. I mean,

73
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:47,770
I don't want to diminish the horrors of
human slavery because in human slavery

74
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:52,240
at least there's no question whatsoever
that that's a human and there's

75
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:55,300
communication. Yeah. So it's,
it's as awful as it gets.

76
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,150
But God damn put the ignorance aside.

77
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:02,950
The slavery of killer whales is like
really close. It's really close.

78
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,450
The only way to get them
to work effectively and
efficiently is to keep them

79
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:10,180
hungry. Oh, drug them
and keep them hungry.

80
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:15,220
So yeah, it's brutal. Now is it
still legal? I mean, isn't, see,

81
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,420
he's since seaworld. Are they expanding?
Didn't they just make a bigger,

82
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:22,390
a pool for the silhouettes?
Like, well, we're slow.

83
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:25,480
We're so nice to her killer whales.
We gave him a bigger k. Yeah.

84
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:28,480
So what they've done is they've tried to
repackage the show as we were not doing

85
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:30,580
the big dynamic show, but they
really still are. They're like,

86
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:34,150
we're just showing natural behaviors.
Which is bitch natural behavior.

87
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:36,970
Let them go fuck up a whale. Shit.
They put a fuck. They put like a,

88
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,600
like a backdrop of a couple trees
assumption, new show. Hey, see,

89
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:43,750
well this is what other crazy shit going
on. I mean in, in a, in California,

90
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,030
see world now see where promise
to stop banning. Uh, uh, they,

91
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,620
they promised to stop
breathing the killer whales.

92
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,630
But these fucking promises don't do not
believe for a moment that they're like

93
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:58,030
some type of responsible
corporate citizens. It's
gonna hold on to this thing.

94
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:01,480
It's bullshit. So we're an
entity, a business entity.
They're trying to make money.

95
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,230
And so what California did was
they went out and banned it.

96
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:09,010
So in California you can't breed Orkos.
I import export issues, all that,

97
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,010
but in Florida. So again,
see what makes the promise.

98
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,230
They had an Orca protection act that they
were looking to do exactly. California.

99
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:15,750
We're going to put it,

100
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,210
they were going to make it concrete
passed the law that way that we see world

101
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:20,830
can't just backpedal on it down the road,

102
00:05:20,831 --> 00:05:24,760
which everyone suspects they will see
where this lobbying like fucking crazy and

103
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:28,450
just just last week says
successfully defeated the bill again,

104
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,140
they're putting a lot of the world
is trying to defeat a bill that they

105
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:33,850
successfully defeated multiple times,

106
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,170
including that just last week that allows
them or be the bill would keep them

107
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,970
from breeding these animals in captivity.

108
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,000
You're fighting against that
successfully fighting. It's over.

109
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:46,750
They're doing it in Florida. Yeah.
While they're pretending in California,

110
00:05:46,751 --> 00:05:48,790
they don't want to breed
them. Well, no. In California,

111
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,310
they actually passed the law,
the State Law in Florida.

112
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:56,110
It was defeated repeatedly and now
fun last down. So they're trying,

113
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,090
they're trying to breed animals in
captivity and if they do breed them in

114
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:01,790
Florida, there'll be able to ship
them to California, to China.

115
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,160
So that's what the demand is right now.
And in fact,

116
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:08,210
seaworld was just bought by a large
Chinese corporation they just named.

117
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,170
They just named one of the,
one of the guys to the seaworld board.

118
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,520
And so what people,

119
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,060
I mean it's safe to assume that this
is exactly what's happening is zero.

120
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:20,260
This is planning their exit strategy
and they're gonna start sending their,

121
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,620
their orcas to, to China. Oh Geez. That's
a booming industry right now. In fact,

122
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,540
killer whale captivity is like,

123
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,710
if you can get your and there and it's all
coming out of Russia, right still. But,

124
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,160
and so there's still capturing them in
the wild. Yup. And in China it's, it's a,

125
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:41,150
it's a burgeoning,
a booming industry man.

126
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,910
44 [inaudible] lotion,
theme parks in China right now.

127
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,350
She is building a black crazy.
How many of them are in the United States?

128
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,000
How many aquariums? Yeah, I don't know.
I can't, I can't say for sure. Ah,

129
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,750
I was actually surprised to read
there's like 300 something dolphins in

130
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:59,090
captivity in the states. I didn't,
I think that was the number I saw.

131
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,440
I didn't realize there was that big.

132
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:03,020
I had no idea that there was that
many in captivity in the states.

133
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:07,580
It just seems to be such an
archaic thing that it just,

134
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:10,220
I can't imagine that the United
States wants to keep doing that.

135
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:13,310
The fact that seaworld is trying to keep
doing that in Florida and that they've

136
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:17,360
successfully lobbied to allow them to
keep breeding these animals in captivity.

137
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,990
But you can't, once you have them
in captivity for a long time,

138
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:23,780
safe seaworld wanted to release them.
They can't really release them.

139
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,150
There's nowhere to release them.
And that's what's being worked on now.

140
00:07:26,151 --> 00:07:28,880
There's a project called the
whale sanctuary project and I,

141
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,610
I suspect there'll be a fairly
large announcement soon.

142
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:35,480
I believe there'll be
looking at a location and in
Canada and they're going to

143
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:37,460
build this thing though there
will be a place for them,

144
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,920
which is a great place to do it
because then how would they do that?

145
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,540
Well you go coastal of course.

146
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,760
I mean you gotta be in the ocean and you
got a pen off an area. You've got to,

147
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,930
I mean there's lots of things to consider.

148
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,880
You've got to make sure
there's a lot of water changes.

149
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:47,740
So a lot of different things.

150
00:07:47,741 --> 00:07:51,380
Cause you can't keep the animal and
something that's going to stagnate the

151
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,720
minute. So it's going to be
some sort of a cage it, yeah.

152
00:07:53,721 --> 00:07:57,170
I'm assume a fence of sorts around there.
Maybe like a fjord.

153
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,680
I wouldn't be a fjord if it's in Canada,
but like just imagine jump it.

154
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:05,270
I imagine that they'll make certain that
that's not going to be the case. But uh,

155
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,930
while they can, I've seen,
I've seen dolphins jump out
of the pool. That's crazy.

156
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:13,430
Really? Yeah. Yeah. I got rushed in one
morning to, uh, uh, called him because uh,

157
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,300
because a dolphin jumped out of the pool.
Holy Shit.

158
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,610
I mean that's a wake up call when you
get there and you see this thing flopping

159
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:22,430
around and you're like,
Jesus Christ and I didn't do well.

160
00:08:22,431 --> 00:08:24,200
You get the sling together.
First off, there's, you know,

161
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:26,840
we have these different slings and things
that, you know, to move these dolphins.

162
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:30,890
So I was, I was alone. I was a dolphin
way. Yeah. Like 500 pounds, 600 pounds.

163
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:32,600
In this case she was,
she was a decent size female.

164
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:35,530
So I went and grabbed a kid out in
the ticket booth. There's some shifts.

165
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,990
It was too early in the morning. I had no
staff there. Russia men. I'm like, dude,

166
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,840
I got two guys. I'm like, we gotta get
this dolphin and these guys. I mean,

167
00:08:41,841 --> 00:08:43,940
if you've never done that before,
your jaws on the floor.

168
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,010
I fucking had these two steel poles
on my shoulders. Dolphin in the sling,

169
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,890
lifting her up. I swear to you, man,
my back went backwards like this.

170
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:55,160
It was the heaviest thing
I'd ever carried, but we got
her back in. It was crazy.

171
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,020
But yeah, jumped out of the
pool. It was crazy. In fact,

172
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,580
there was a time in the summer,

173
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,280
I remember where one of our
dolphins were teetering on the edge,

174
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:04,410
which you would do, is she,
you know, they're, they're
always spy hop and like this,

175
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:05,400
looking over the edge of the crowd,

176
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,070
explaining that to people that are
just listening, just listening.

177
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,100
So imagine there's like a short wall,
something that they can look over.

178
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,920
So there's sort of spy hop in
there, spying up to look. Okay.

179
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,340
One of our dolphins learned that she
can actually jump up on the ledge and

180
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:18,570
balance.
Now she was on that.

181
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:21,270
That's like an eight foot drop to the
concrete and the other side of the school.

182
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,540
She's up there posing. I'm
hearing the crowd, I'm backstage.

183
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,520
I hear the crowd going crazy. I'm
like, what is this? I go with her.

184
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,260
She's having fun doing this.
Holy Shit.

185
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,870
That's the dolphin that jumped
out as what we did with,

186
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,850
I said we got to take her out
of this pool. We took her out,

187
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:34,950
put her in the back pool where
no one would see her of course.

188
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,510
And that's the next day
she actually jumped.

189
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,890
So she'd be dead today if
we hadn't of moved her. Oh.

190
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,580
Then of course all Marineland did
was put up like more, you know,

191
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,740
more obstruction, things to
keep, keep me in the pool.

192
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,690
So now when you find her outside of the
pool, how long had she been outside for?

193
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,120
She was still wet, so it wasn't so
bad. But one, uh, one dolphin was,

194
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:54,200
we found her that she, she, she
got stuck on the stage overnight.

195
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:58,080
And when we got there,
her skin had become so dry that it was,

196
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,180
it was starting to crack.
It was kind of fucked up.

197
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,940
She actually has this permanent
scar from try not to yeah.

198
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,990
And a chunk come out when, I don't
know what she was probably thrashed.

199
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,490
Are you talking to her when you find
there? Do you try to comfort her? Like,

200
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,090
I mean, yeah, sure. I'm hugging her
and everything else. Let's say she,

201
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:17,970
did she calm down when she realizes
that people were trying to help her?

202
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,470
Like are they aware of what's going on
or she in a panic, they always fight.

203
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,790
They always fight if they don't want to.

204
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,380
I mean this particular
dolphin was a fighter.

205
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:27,040
Every time we ever tried to put
her in a sling. And we were,

206
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:31,110
I mean one time I love,
I could go back in memories and I can,

207
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,950
I can remember my thoughts
during these times. And uh,

208
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,730
we had her in a sling
hovering over the pool.

209
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,120
And the way the sling is is you've got
two holes in the sling where the pex go

210
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:42,720
in, right, the pectoral fins. And
then one where the genital slit is.

211
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:45,660
So if they shit, it doesn't end up
stuck in the, in the sling, but,

212
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,670
and then you've got a crane,
a top.

213
00:10:47,671 --> 00:10:49,320
So now you've got this thing
lifted over the pool. Well,

214
00:10:49,321 --> 00:10:53,940
she's fighting like crazy and we can
see that there's a tear in the sling as

215
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:55,410
she's fighting, fighting,
fighting. We'd get her,

216
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,800
the crane just gets rid of the pool to
sling rip. She's plunked into the pool.

217
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:00,750
Holy Shit Man.
And we've,

218
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,900
we've slimmed out like 15,000 pound or
10,000 pound killer whales over like 30

219
00:11:06,811 --> 00:11:09,930
40 feet in the air. Imagine one
of those five drops. Oh my God.

220
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,210
So that was sort of a wake
up call. Wow. Yeah. Archaic
procedures, man. Moving these,

221
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,900
these things. The things that,
especially at a place like marine land,

222
00:11:18,901 --> 00:11:20,910
Marine Marineland when you step through
the doors and hopefully you don't,

223
00:11:20,911 --> 00:11:24,300
but if you do, it's like you've
gone back to the 70s the jazz,

224
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,520
any of this hurt their business.

225
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,830
Attendance is abysmal over there.
They're crushed. I live right.

226
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:34,620
I S I watched the sunset over
marine land from my front yard.

227
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:36,630
It's a beautiful site.
I drive by, of course,

228
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,610
just about every day that their
attendance is rocked and Niagara Falls,

229
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:45,240
which where it is, where
marine land is, is booming.

230
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,120
The tourism is through the roof.
You can't,

231
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,500
it's shoulder to shoulder over there
and Murraylands seeing none of it.

232
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:52,250
And you think it's because people know
about the conditions of, absolutely.

233
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,490
I've got a lot of support
in the local community.

234
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:57,070
Like people know exactly what's going on.
A tourist,

235
00:11:57,071 --> 00:12:00,100
it's a little more difficult than, you
know, Nag falls welcomes millions of them,

236
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:02,350
so you're going to get a fraction of that,
but it is a fraction.

237
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,050
Murraylands not benefiting
from the booming tourism there.

238
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,680
They're on their way out the, they're
on a clock for sure. For sure.

239
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,880
I'd be shocked to hear them opening
in 2019 I'm not going to make that

240
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:16,480
prediction, but I would be shocked.
It's, it's that bad. But to be fair,

241
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:17,610
there's no investors at Marineland.

242
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,650
It's one sole controlling mine
owner who started with nothing.

243
00:12:20,651 --> 00:12:24,790
He started with 2000 bucks, built this
thing. He is indebted to nobody. He's,

244
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,410
you know, his cash rich. Of course,

245
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,510
and he's got a lot of fuck you
money and not a lot of times.

246
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:30,650
So he's out to fuck shit up.
I wouldn't be surprised to know.

247
00:12:30,651 --> 00:12:35,640
And a lot of time in life. You
mean like 84 years old now?
Yeah. And so, uh, I would,

248
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,430
I wouldn't be surprised to think that
he's rationalized in his mind to just

249
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:44,830
fucking sewer this thing like destroy,
destroy all our lives.

250
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:48,580
We're having spoken out but just tank the
park in the process. Fucking wow. Yeah.

251
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:53,230
He's very defined. He's a, he's a, he's
a very paranoid and defiant men. And so,

252
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,440
you know, at 84 years old, what else
does he have left to accomplish?

253
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:59,000
I guess so you were saying
that 50 Beluga whales,

254
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,620
B plus maybe even 60 at this point,
Beluga whales are huge. Yeah.

255
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,580
What is a big one way?
I don't know if we've ever met,

256
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,530
if we ever actually weighed our big
magnetic yes. At 4,000 pounds, maybe five.

257
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:16,790
You got 50 of those. 50 of them. Yeah.
That's insane. Try Catching one. Oh,

258
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,480
I don't want to try it. I used
to get tasked with, here's your,

259
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,150
here's your scuba gear,
here's a,

260
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,570
a net the size of a football field called
catch that Beluga whale is that me and

261
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:29,290
my buddies would be like, okay, here
we go. Oh Dude, you'd be, you'd be,

262
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,130
it really would be amazing to be able to
capture the things we've done on video.

263
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:37,540
Can you recognize the difference
in intelligence between
killer whales, dolphins,

264
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:41,650
Beluga whales, dolphins, dolphins, and
killer whales are like remarkably similar.

265
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,040
Just cunning. Smart. You could turn
your back and they're pickpocketing you.

266
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,320
I mean they are just,
and they're brats and I love brats.

267
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,660
I mean they just are bratty animal.
They're having fun. They're having,

268
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,390
while they're fucking with you,
they would like to make things difficult.

269
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:55,210
If they know, if they know
how to frustrate you, they're
going to exercise that.

270
00:13:55,211 --> 00:13:58,300
So it's always a mental game, especially
with when you're dealing with animals,

271
00:13:58,301 --> 00:14:01,570
training with analysts, a Beluga whales
are really timid. So like, you know,

272
00:14:01,571 --> 00:14:04,540
they call him the canaries of the
seat, cause it kind of skittish. So,

273
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:07,060
I don't know if that's a reflection
of their intelligence necessarily,

274
00:14:07,061 --> 00:14:10,180
but I would call them like maybe,
uh, uh, maybe a hint more dumb,

275
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:13,620
