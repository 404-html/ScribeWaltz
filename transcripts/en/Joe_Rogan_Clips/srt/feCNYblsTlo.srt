1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:05,250
Her low freak bitches and
I go, I gotta go, I leave.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,250
And then I'd never worked,
worked out of that gym again.
I was like, well, I'm done.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,160
I can't come here anymore. I just
fucking guys trying to get my money.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,810
Plus he's a big dude. So it was kind
of dangerous. Dangerous to say no dude.

5
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:18,990
I used to work out with David Duke
when I was growing up. Holy Shit.

6
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:23,700
We shared it back fence when I was
growing up. Holy Shit. We used to go to,

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,300
I mean that's kind of, I don't know if
you consider the Ku Klux Klan up here.

8
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:30,430
Ms came or not, but um, and he dated,

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,310
I worked at this seafood restaurant.

10
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:36,090
I was a bus boy over there and he dated
the prettiest girl that worked at the

11
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:39,750
seafood restaurant. Was this when he
was in the KKK? No, this was afters.

12
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,190
Nonpracticing honestly seemed like a
nice guy to, how many years ago was this?

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,650
This is 1995 so that was when
he was in the public eye.

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,850
He was like a big deal back
then. It wasn't that one.
It was it later than that,

15
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:58,560
that he was like running for public
office? Let me think. It was no,

16
00:00:58,561 --> 00:01:01,110
when I was younger,
he was running against Edwin Edwards,

17
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:04,350
I believe for public office.
I was probably around 1990 or 88.

18
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,540
I feel like he did some
stuff after that though,

19
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:09,450
on a national level or
wasn't on a state level.

20
00:01:09,451 --> 00:01:11,280
What does he run for governor
or something like that?

21
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,510
He ran for governor a couple times.
Yeah, him and I remember the signs.

22
00:01:15,511 --> 00:01:18,790
It was cause Edwin Edwards
was a crook allegedly. And uh,

23
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,370
David Duke was a racist and that's what
the one of the campaign poster said,

24
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:26,880
don't vote for the racist vote for
the Crook. That was the campaign.

25
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,810
Jesus Christ was everywhere. She's
crying and a crook one. That man one.

26
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,730
That's cool. Well, we used to go to the
gym and I'll tell you this, many was,

27
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,850
you know, I'm not unbelievers in
his practices, but he was, uh,

28
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:43,410
he was elected to Louisiana House of
Representatives in 1989 and that year the

29
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:46,620
sitting representative resigned
his seat to become a judge.

30
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,370
And Duke ran in the special
election to fill a seat.

31
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,830
The daily beast describes
the race and writing, uh,

32
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,850
the off year special election in which
David Duke through himself little media

33
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:03,750
notice at first out through him.
So through himself, a little media,

34
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:07,800
nudist note notice at first
who turned himself to as a,

35
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,120
what they touted himself as a prolife
fiscal conservative was known as an x clan

36
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:12,391
member.

37
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:17,160
He has shooed overtly racist language
and instead pointed to crime in the city

38
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:21,750
criticizing affirmative action and
minority set asides. Hmm. Yeah.

39
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:25,650
I just did chest and Tris or them,
so I wasn't in all that, you know,

40
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,310
we just did basic workouts. Did he quit
like a bitch when the reps got high?

41
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,180
He was uh, he was, he was an animal. He
was, he was strong. He a strong man. Gai.

42
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:34,470
Yeah.

43
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,230
Probably a lot of people after him to
kill him probably got to be on your p's

44
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:40,980
and q's probably. And he
gave me direction. He just
gave me direction, you know,

45
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:44,250
and he didn't, yeah, like how to do it
right. He didn't conversation a ton,

46
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,660
but he would, yeah. This is how you do
it. This is how you do it, you know? Uh,

47
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,890
did you ever ask him about the clan?
I didn't ask him about that date.

48
00:02:51,891 --> 00:02:54,720
I wanted to try and meet his lady did.
I was trying to mill around us.

49
00:02:54,721 --> 00:02:57,440
He fucking smell a pair
of her pants alone.

50
00:02:57,441 --> 00:03:01,150
Do you feel me doing when you were a
little kid? I mean, at that time I was 15

51
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,980
correct, bro. I never been where
wrecked and I wasn't back ever. Yeah.

52
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,050
Yeah.
