1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:05,970
The joe rogan experience you watch off
of robots and not in this country have

2
00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:08,140
found out. It's a weird
moral thing though, right?

3
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:12,130
Like would you or would you rather have
them fuck a little robot in their closet

4
00:00:12,131 --> 00:00:15,460
somewhere? You know, first instinct
is always like, oh, that's horrible,

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,480
but then you're like,
it's Kinda like giving someone with anger.

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,080
She was a punching bag. Maybe it's
not the worst thing. It's like you,

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,780
they've got that thing,
whatever it is.

8
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:26,770
Like how do you get it out on that
little sweet, sweet, beautiful punching.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,330
So fucked up.

10
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,540
That's your list. Your child.
Fuck robots don't punch back.

11
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,840
You want to like meet in the middle
of, you're like, okay, it's legal,

12
00:00:37,841 --> 00:00:41,320
but you can't name it.
Well,

13
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:43,180
do you think that you
could fuck a real doll?

14
00:00:43,181 --> 00:00:44,830
I mean you definitely could if you had to,

15
00:00:44,831 --> 00:00:46,630
but would that be something
you'd be interested in?

16
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,710
I think I couldn't stop laughing at how
ridiculous this situation or rather just

17
00:00:50,711 --> 00:00:54,370
jerk off and think about
things we had as a sponsor.

18
00:00:54,371 --> 00:00:59,050
A flashlight had a flashlight forever.
It's very utilitarian.

19
00:00:59,051 --> 00:01:02,740
You're not confusing yourself.
Has Ever said that word before describing.

20
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,660
She's the girl of my dreams. I've
never been, I've had it forever.

21
00:01:07,661 --> 00:01:10,630
I've never even thought about it. I
couldn't guess why I would want to use it.

22
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,230
Seems Weird. It's weird. It
feels good though. Does it
way better than jerking off.

23
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,190
Yeah, it does. Really. Engulfs
your whole Dick and you,

24
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,850
you put it in warm water and you
get it to a temperature of a potty

25
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,370
and you like it gets too weird,
surreal.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,500
Somehow or another.
There's is like a portal.

27
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,830
Like this tube is a portal to
another woman, another dementia,

28
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:37,760
but all you can get at is her vagina
and just hold it. That's it. Feels real.

29
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,530
The name of this dimension
is called awesome.

30
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,860
Do you jerk off with a fleshlight
or do you hold it and fuck it? No,

31
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,310
you jerk off with it jerked me
off with the flashlight. Yeah,

32
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,720
but that was for show.
That was on camera behind the curt green.

33
00:01:50,721 --> 00:01:54,260
This interview. We did this on
the podcast. I swear to God,

34
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:57,950
he jerked me off with a flashlight
producer. I couldn't get hard.

35
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,560
There was a female comic. Whoa. What's
that about? Is that a fuck real?

36
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,840
That's a real doctor. Real though.
They gave him pretty good man.

37
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,670
They were red head though. It was a
documentary on Netflix about people.

38
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,680
Fucking sex robots really have come far
because there are people who fall in

39
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:18,170
love with these sex robots and it looks
like the fucking taxi driver Johnny on

40
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,490
the spot from total recall.

41
00:02:19,491 --> 00:02:23,450
It's like this is crazy like
animatronic Chuckie cheese, bass player.

42
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,810
It's kind of get to a point where it can
totally mimic you and he's going to get

43
00:02:26,811 --> 00:02:29,570
to a point where it really is like
blade runner. Is that what they are now?

44
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,530
That's a good one. I thought about
buying a dude one to do Jujitsu with.

45
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:38,590
I was going to order one
[inaudible] and a seal butthole.

46
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,870
That proportions are perfect
because I have a dog.

47
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,980
This is Bubba dumbing the practice
submissions on, but it's super stiff.

48
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,010
It's like this, but he beat you.
You basically can drill the moves,

49
00:02:52,011 --> 00:02:56,060
but it's not the same as drilling
and on an anatomically correct body.

50
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,950
If you had an an anatomically
correct body to practice on,

51
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,210
you'd get some fucking tight moves.
You can't wait.

52
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,520
Can't wait til the day when you're
announcing for robot fights,

53
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,350
not having to zero interest. There's
nothing at stake if they live or die.

54
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,273
It doesn't matter.

55
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,750
Did the whole thing about fighting is
that there's some horrible gigantic thing

56
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:21,130
at stake. You can fuck one though. Yeah,
he fuck with him. I watch him fight.

57
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,820
What'd you watch? Two robots.
Fuck. I would, I would,

58
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:27,190
if there was like some sort of a
program that they were running,

59
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,240
I'd want to see like what the program was.
It wouldn't be a jack material.

60
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,120
Completely be fascinated.

61
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,580
They would probably like talk to each
other and numbers and they would both be

62
00:03:36,581 --> 00:03:40,060
dudes. They would both be, there was one
that they just made a fuck doll. Right.

63
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,490
And this is, this just happened
there. There's videos of it.

64
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,820
The robot started speaking like
a weird code to each other.

65
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,120
These were like fucking like
straight up fuck dolls, skynet, dude.

66
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,760
And they would turn them on and then they
started speaking and would seem like a

67
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:54,310
code. And people were like,
freaking out about this.

68
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,850
I know what you're talking
about. Yeah. They had these
computers. Could, they were,

69
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,640
they were linked together and they
started communicating to each other in a

70
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:05,620
language that the coders didn't understand
and um, they shut it off. They're like,

71
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:08,710
what?
Just simply to unplug that they think,

72
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,750
but I heard that my version of it that I
just said might be the most spectacular

73
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:16,390
version sounding,
but might not be accurate.

74
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,610
And then what did they
might've gotten is like,

75
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,230
they might've got stuck in like a feedback
loop and just been making jibberish I

76
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:25,120
heard that too.
So I don't know.

77
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,970
Nothing's confirmed way too
fucking stupid to know who's right.

78
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,020
Let's just hope it's that second
one. The first one, funny story.

79
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,160
I just want sounds like a opening
scene in terminator movie. Yeah,

80
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:38,770
that's what I mean. But at the same
time that the solution being like,

81
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,200
don't plug that in. And again, man,

82
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,090
I know you're gonna want to
hang right there. Like what,

83
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,930
what the fuck are we going to do?

84
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:51,931
Like I had a podcast with Sam Harris about
it and he is terrified of AI and he's

85
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:56,320
far smarter than me. Whenever I talked
to him about shit, I go, oh, okay.

86
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,090
And he's terrified.
Terrified.

87
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:01,540
That's what freaks me out is when people
way smarter than me are terrified about

88
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:04,450
it. Like a, what's his name who just
passed away? Elon Musk is terrified.

89
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:08,890
Stephen Hawkins. Stephen
Hawking. No, no, no. This is
going bad. And then you're like,

90
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,080
shit,
sometimes there's too close to it.

91
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,860
I feel like some people also get too
bogged down to the details when you live

92
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:19,350
here life very ignorantly. Like I do,
I have no fear of AI technology guy.

93
00:05:19,351 --> 00:05:22,990
So I'll be honest with you, self
driving, Tesla already killed somebody

94
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,970
driving a taxi or whatever.
She did something very reckless.

95
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,990
She walked right into traffic and
she might've been a homeless lady.

96
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,240
She might have been on drugs. They're
not, they're not exactly sure.

97
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:36,970
I don't think the results of
the autopsy are out yet. But uh,

98
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:39,730
you've watched the video. She basically
just walks right in front of the car.

99
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,530
Like the car's going down the road.

100
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:45,790
So a person driving it wouldn't have made
much difference. Maybe. I don't know,

101
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:49,180
man. I mean, it was, it's a hard to tell
whether or not you'd be able to react.

102
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,680
Well, I guess the technology
is, does it ha, you know, the,

103
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,900
the technology of stopping quick
enough to not hit somebody,

104
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,640
they want to make it safer. Right. That's
the idea. Yeah. But I think it is, right.

105
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,030
I think there's more human error when
you're dealing with people drinking,

106
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:04,340
smoking weed,
paying attention to their cell phones.

107
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,390
I almost would rather just
trust, you know, even if
there's a few deaths per year,

108
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:10,700
there's way more death for a year with,
you know,

109
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,510
people being it idiot just laid out the
logic for why the robots are going to

110
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,210
the lady in black. I trust them. I
trust them. It's a black lady, right?

111
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,750
I don't know.
He'll be fine.

112
00:06:18,751 --> 00:06:22,830
There's another video of just stopping
perfectly for a white woman running races,

113
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,110
tests.
It needs to reflect on your skin.

114
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,890
Anything but anything dark in the
Mediterranean. It just fucking run. Joe.

115
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,100
The tassel stops it.
All of

116
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,490
that stops it Persian.
