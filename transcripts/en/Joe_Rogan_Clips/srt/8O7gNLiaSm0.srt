1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,770
I like this is two banks. Should we
take couple rips right now? Okay,

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,340
that is fucking awesome. This is a here,
here, here's your own little joint.

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:09,900
We're like,

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,520
we're in like this wave of like being
evolved and not being involved at the same

5
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:14,701
time,

6
00:00:14,701 --> 00:00:19,701
like technologically spectacularly evolve
to the point where we can bend matter

7
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:25,011
and create nuclear weapons and fly robots
to Mars and take pictures and send it

8
00:00:25,321 --> 00:00:26,130
back to us.

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,520
Like the shit that we could do is
off the charts when it comes to like

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,080
technology and our ability to manipulate
the world around us and create giant

11
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:37,680
buildings and structures and
airplanes and bridges and shit.

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,520
But the monkey interaction
thing is still not very good,

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,050
so we still have war.

14
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,460
We still have places where we send
people over with metal tanks and guns and

15
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:50,580
shoot people and protect people from the
other people that are shooting people

16
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:55,430
and get involved in all these fucking
crazy things are physical interactions as

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,520
organisms are just still
in this barbaric stage.

18
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,500
We're still in this one tribe going after
another tribe stage from 20,000 years

19
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:07,590
ago, 30,000 years ago. It's
like the same programming,

20
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,300
but now this programming can fly jets
filled with missiles and shoot them out of

21
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:16,940
the sky. Sneak up on you underwater
in a metal tube, a submarine.

22
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,000
It shoots fucking nuclear with
missiles and shit underwater.

23
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,820
I mean we're in the weirdest flux.

24
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:28,821
We're in this weird sort of unbalanced
period in the evolution of the human

25
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:34,491
organism because we can do so much and
then put Donald's in charge man about

26
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:36,240
fucking everything.

27
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:40,230
We're mad about men who decide they're
women who want to use the girls' room.

28
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,350
We're mad about everything.
We're about about religion.

29
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:48,120
We're mad about rights and gender and
everything. Everything. We're mad,

30
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:50,910
everyone's mad. Fuck Roseanne
Barr, everyone's bad.

31
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,240
Everyone is so mad and while all this
is all this weird personal interaction,

32
00:01:56,581 --> 00:01:59,550
shit is happening that's
distracting the fuck out of us.

33
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,190
The more it ramps up the the better.

34
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:07,191
Ai gets our foot artificial intelligence
because it gets just keep working on it

35
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,390
and keep getting better and better.

36
00:02:09,391 --> 00:02:14,160
We're going to be in like a full on rock
fight. When AI goes live, it's like,

37
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,630
it's like we're, we're falling into
this whole, like if this was a trap,

38
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,780
if I was artificial intelligence
and I knew how to be like,

39
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:25,560
well as what we'll do is just go back
in time and set people up and make them

40
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:26,394
make us.

41
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,670
We'll just plant this idea in their heads
and just like an aquatic worm makes a

42
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,670
caterpillar or one of those grasshoppers
rather jump into a pool and drowned

43
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:37,710
itself so that it could
swim out of its brain.

44
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,220
You ever see one of those things happen
just like that. Ai is doing that with us.

45
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,400
They give us Shiny Samsung Galaxy note
nine look at how big the whole pottery is

46
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,130
and now it takes photos of
your face and knows your face.

47
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:55,010
They can tell you face to face id and
fingerprints and before you know it,

48
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,740
listen, we found the best way to
get a signal to talk. People there,

49
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,320
you just stick it in your ass.
It's a little palate.

50
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,390
We're going to put our little robot Dick
in our ass, a little pepper that pellet.

51
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,110
If you could just hold in your ass.
It's smooth.

52
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:12,400
Do you barely know what's in there? But
it connects with your, your ass is open.

53
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,250
It's not like the rest of your skin
and y'all got to keep it in your mouth.

54
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,990
Right. Well to ask is the way to
go cause it's like open, you know,

55
00:03:17,991 --> 00:03:21,730
it's not like you don't have to go
through the dermis and so that just just

56
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:25,210
connects with you and you can
fucking see augmented reality.

57
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:28,570
But the little tiny robot dick, it's
about that big. You barely feel it.

58
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:33,000
It's like a BB. Uh, that's what's
going to happen dude. Fucking prior.

59
00:03:33,001 --> 00:03:37,210
I do. These things are growing
or not the anti aging shit too.

60
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:38,860
Who knows how crazy that's going to get.

61
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,590
I think with the weirdest
thing is not the anti aging.

62
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:43,750
I think that we're going to run
into biological limitations.

63
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:47,890
I think the weirdest shit is gene editing.
Fuck yeah.

64
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,350
It's took a turn for the stoner

65
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,980
gene editing scares the shit out of me.

66
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,060
Was that unexplained on the explain
that new Netflix, Netflix show,

67
00:03:58,061 --> 00:04:02,380
gene editing and how did that shit's
going to go wild wild country.

68
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,290
I only watched the first episode,
but I was like, Holy Shit,

69
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:08,650
I see where this is going
to follow show baby.

70
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,910
Fuck everyone man.

71
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,860
As far as tech and I'm like,
it takes a turn,

72
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:22,330
but I'm sure he still had good intentions.
I think trying to build the community,

73
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:24,700
I'm just passionate about
us. Again, this is the thing,

74
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:29,140
it's the fucking human interaction part
is the part that we can't get right.

75
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,460
It's real weird.

76
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,300
If you look at all the different kinds
of interactions that we managed to

77
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:35,490
successfully navigate and me,

78
00:04:35,491 --> 00:04:39,610
people have obviously have problems in
business and there's lawsuits in business

79
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:42,640
and there's people that get fired and
there's all sorts of problems with people

80
00:04:42,641 --> 00:04:46,810
doing business, but overall they
get a lot of things done right.

81
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,630
Like business keeps improving.
Things keep getting better.

82
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,630
We barely improve with
how we treat each other,

83
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,090
like the way human
beings treat each other.

84
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,740
We barely get better at that and
we do react to things better.

85
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,341
Like,

86
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:05,341
if we're mad at someone for doing
something that's like more clear with like

87
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,760
agregious violations of our code, right?
Like racism, like this Roseanne thing,

88
00:05:10,761 --> 00:05:13,750
it was a big one, right? Everybody
was like, no fucking way.

89
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:17,500
We're not tolerating that. Fuck
her. And then ABC like, Yo, fuck it.

90
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:20,650
We're pulling the plug on the show.
It's like immediate reactions. Yep.

91
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,100
So it's like what I, what I'm,
I don't think it was right.

92
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:28,220
I think she's got a lot of problems and
she's taken a shit load of pills and she

93
00:05:28,221 --> 00:05:31,750
was all fucked up. And I know she's
not racist. At least she tells me that.

94
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,550
But what I do know is that racism is
horrible and people just don't want to

95
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:38,680
tolerate it anymore.
And that's what the good thing is.

96
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:39,580
The good thing is like this,
right?

97
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,820
There's overwhelming response from
people that they're not tolerating racism

98
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:49,000
anymore. You can't do that
anymore. We won't tolerate it.

99
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,970
And this is fairly new man.

100
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,920
I mean with the civil rights marches,
that was in the 60s right?

101
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:57,681
I mean,

102
00:05:57,681 --> 00:06:00,800
think about what was going on in the
50s and the forties and fed that shit.

103
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,400
That was not that long ago in terms
of like how long there's been people.

104
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,150
So we're dealing with this
radical change in this regard,

105
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:13,550
but very little change in like
our kindness to each other. Yeah,

106
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,250
that's right. Did start the American
mushroom day or not the American,

107
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:23,900
the worldwide. Are you sure fear has a
holiday that he created called true fast?

108
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,770
Yeah. It's several days are
doesn't fuck around our,

109
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,130
he has had a real job since he was
the doorman at the comedy store.

110
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,250
He operates on its own schedule.
That's,

111
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,480
that's what it's going to take for
something like that worldwide to change.

112
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,170
It'll certainly help cause shrimp fest
certainly out she's rooms will help.

113
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,450
I'm promoting that.
But I feel like I'm,

114
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,790
part of it is because we're scared.
I legitimately feel like we're scared.

115
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,070
And I think when someone
like Trump is in office,

116
00:06:52,071 --> 00:06:56,030
we're more scared because we
realize how easy it is for, uh,

117
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,231
you know,

118
00:06:57,231 --> 00:07:00,230
I hate to use the term regular
person cause he's definitely
not a regular person.

119
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,260
He's very successful and very famous
and everybody knew who he was,

120
00:07:03,261 --> 00:07:05,450
but regular person in terms of we don't,

121
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,310
that's not how it politician acts like
that. This is like some crazy show man.

122
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,520
And when a crazy show man
becomes the leader of the thing,

123
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:14,730
whether or not he's doing good is it,

124
00:07:14,731 --> 00:07:18,080
I'm not even arguing politically whether
it's doing good or bad or the economy's

125
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:21,980
up because of him. I don't know.
But it's just how he behaves.

126
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,990
It's who he is like that
that freaks people out. That
makes people more on edge.

127
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,650
And so they're more angry and
they're, they're, they're,

128
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,380
they're more looking to call people out
on things and they're more looking to

129
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:35,030
stomp out racism.
I get it.

130
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,050
Imagine what people would think if
someone like Sam Harris was a precedent or

131
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:39,380
something.

132
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,380
He was talking about a national mushroom
day are talking about that stuff.

133
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,230
How bad people would freak out.
Seriously.

134
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,530
They would freak or are they just people
that disagree with Sam too? You know,

135
00:07:48,531 --> 00:07:52,760
there's a ton of very, very smart
people that disagree with Sam, you know,

136
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:55,070
and it's really interesting
to see those disagreements.

137
00:07:55,071 --> 00:07:59,570
Cause when really high level intellects
debate each other about things or

138
00:07:59,571 --> 00:08:04,571
disagree on things and you get to see
not just their ideas play out and how

139
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:10,190
their ideas work against the other
person's ideas. You get to see that,

140
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:15,820
but you also get to see like thinking and,

141
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,570
and, and, and communicating
at a super high level, right?

142
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:24,890
They're intellectuals are
trying to outsmart each other
so that they're debating

143
00:08:24,891 --> 00:08:28,940
about, you know, the existence of
God or whatever the fuck it is.

When you get really smart people who
disagree on Shit. Very fascinating.

145
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,740
It's like one of the more interesting
things to watch. So like in a lot of ways,

146
00:08:36,741 --> 00:08:41,480
high level Jujitsu, you know, and a lot
of ways you're watching like, oh, okay.

147
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:45,580

148
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,390

when he's, when he's doing these debates.
