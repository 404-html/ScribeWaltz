1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,170
About this. What do you think about Pettis
fight and Wonderboy guy? Good for you.

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:08,610
Pedes I love, I get great fight. Isn't it
Kinda crazy though? He's, it goes from 45,

3
00:00:08,611 --> 00:00:13,140
can't make it any more. All the way up
to 70, 25% about it. Fucking did this.

4
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:17,580
How much of a beast? Pegasus fights
Tony Ferguson. Amazing fight, right?

5
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:22,020
Tony wins that. He gets hurt then fucking,
he was like, you know, fuck it. Uh,

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,300
broke his hand.
Pedes broke his hand in that fight.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,790
So it was a tough fight from either way,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,560
but then he jumps up and he's
fighting Wonderboy. Yeah.

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,930
Both use me dog in both fights.
He's an underdog and both
fights. Yeah. Yeah. That,

10
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:38,160
that, that Ferguson fight
was fun. Yeah. It show,

11
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:41,940
it shows you what a survivor Ferguson
as he gets clipped and you know,

12
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:44,030
he got hurt in that fight
and he just grabbed,

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,540
how about Max Holloway and Tony
Ferguson Talking Shit to each other?

14
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,910
Uh, that's the on the, on the dark
web. That's the room. I liked that,

15
00:00:53,911 --> 00:00:56,690
but I don't like that. Why don't
you like it, Ferguson versus Khabib?

16
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,930
I want to see that fight, but to beads
out for, he won't fight in Vegas.

17
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:02,610
He has a suspension,
so he's out for a little bit.

18
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,300
Tony's ready to go that
he won't do the the,

19
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,520
he won't do that thing that Vegas
is asking them to do commercial.

20
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,100
They're asking me to do a commercial.
It was like, you have prostitution,

21
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,010
you have gambling. Fuck you. What's the
best? So why does that seem right to,

22
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:21,180
what's the problem with Connor? Tony?
What's going on with that? How can that,

23
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,820
it's going to be Connor and cowboy,
Connor and cowboys.

24
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:27,050
A done deal as far as I know to
as far as I know. As far as that,

25
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:31,080
we signed the contract. Doesn't
Connor? Tony make more sense though,

26
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,910
know what kind of cowboy is great and
Connor, Tony's great. They're both great.

27
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,780
They're both great sites. If, if I'm,
if I'm Dana, I'm sitting on this.

28
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,330
Eddie, you laugh. I want to be careful
with Tony because you love him.

29
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:47,930
You're friends are going
to question why not?

30
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,010
Because he works for like two years.
Here it is Eddie, Tony, Connor,

31
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:55,050
Connor. Be a slight under
Doug. I think in that fight.

32
00:01:55,051 --> 00:01:56,670
Tony's a monster for anybody.

33
00:01:56,671 --> 00:02:01,671
So I think Tony Max it and cop
cars caught and he's get a win.

34
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,430
I'm not saying Congress can be
a huge favorite over cowboy,

35
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:08,900
but he's more favorable in that fight
they need. Is it going? He's a window for,

36
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,910
he comes back and he needs,
he needs a more favorable fight.

37
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:15,540
And I'm not saying that's a great Matt
Cowboy's a motherfucker and you know,

38
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,510
fire cowboys on fire right now.
He's just so lucid in the zone right now.

39
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,360
And Cowboy. Yeah. Kelby, it's a
great fight style stylistically.

40
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,320
That's a better fight for
cowboy and Connor. Yeah.

41
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,380
Tony's Tony is a great wrestling back
then and he's a motherfucker cardio for

42
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:35,460
days and he's crazy. I liked that fight
a lot. I really liked that fight a lot.

43
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,930
Max Holloway. Tony's a motherfucking
fight. I love that fight.
