1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,460
Have you ever read any Terence Mckenna?

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,050
I know you're familiar with something
called the stoned ape theory. No, sorry,

3
00:00:07,051 --> 00:00:09,390
not Mckenna. It was, uh, he was a,

4
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:14,070
an ethnobotanist and he was also a
psychedelic adventure and he had a theory.

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,210
And the theory was that the,
what you're talking about,

6
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:20,280
this climate change,
uh,

7
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:23,130
that also coincided with a
doubling of the human brain size.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,760
His theory was that one of the things
that was in play was that these apes would

9
00:00:29,341 --> 00:00:32,490
experiment with different food sources
as they moved into the grasslands.

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,530
And there was a lot of undulates and
these grasslands and it's silicide

11
00:00:36,531 --> 00:00:40,290
mushrooms, which we know existed back
then would grow in these grasslands.

12
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,360
And that these monkeys,

13
00:00:43,361 --> 00:00:47,340
these apes rather started consuming
silicide mushrooms and it led them to be

14
00:00:47,341 --> 00:00:48,174
more creative.

15
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,250
And it also led to specific traits like
the development of language that eating

16
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:57,330
mushrooms, um, in low doses
increases visual acuity,

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,240
which would lead them to be better
hunters are more perceptive.

18
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,670
It also leads them to be Hornier,

19
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,500
which would most likely
involve more breeding,

20
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,130
more sexual activity
and possibly select the,

21
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:13,320
the ones that chose the,

22
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:18,150
the mushrooms would maybe possibly breed
more than the ones that didn't choose

23
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:22,170
the mushrooms because they were more
into it. Then we're more social,

24
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,150
more sexually active. And
he has a series of, uh,

25
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,720
like his brother Dennis,
who's still alive,

26
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:35,860
detailed it on a podcast we did the very
first podcast we did in his brother is,

27
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:36,350
is,

28
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:41,350
is an actual scientist and detailed it
in terms of how silicide and affects the

29
00:01:42,091 --> 00:01:46,440
brain and what areas of
the brain it, what, what,

30
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:50,790
what actually takes place when you're
under the influence of this and that it

31
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:55,791
could very potentially have led to the
development of language and that this,

32
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,280
all these things in play, the
throwing arm, the, uh, you know,

33
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,400
developing these new social networks,
uh,

34
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:08,340
with where you need to communicate with
each other along with the harnessing of

35
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:13,341
fire along with the consumption of
psychedelic mushrooms on a regular basis

36
00:02:13,381 --> 00:02:15,720
because they were incredibly
frequent and very edible.

37
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,460
All right, that's total trip. I've
never heard of that. Fascinating.

38
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,610
Like that's a really good
example of some random thing.

39
00:02:21,611 --> 00:02:24,250
If it really did play that role,
how random that is,

40
00:02:24,251 --> 00:02:27,100
that these freaking things happen to be
growing there and that they happen to be

41
00:02:27,101 --> 00:02:30,520
attracted to them and ate them.
We know that animals like to get high.

42
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,880
I'm elephants will eat
these fruit that have,

43
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,180
well the drunk in this case it
overripe and, and um, become alcoholic.

44
00:02:37,181 --> 00:02:38,540
We know that animals will do that.

45
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,400
You've seen jaguars that
consumes psychedelic plants
and they lie on their back

46
00:02:42,401 --> 00:02:45,780
and stare at the sky and there
don't, no. Oh, it's amazing. But you,

47
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,960
you know what I have?
WASC is no, I wasco is a,

48
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,300
it's a way that uh,

49
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,590
these people in the rain forest develop
untold thousands of years ago of

50
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,070
developing an orally active
version of dimethyl trip to Maine.

51
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,600
Do you know what dimethyltryptamine
dimethyltryptamine is the most potent

52
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:08,800
psychedelic known to man.

53
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:13,801
It's incredibly potent drug that is just
intensely hallucinatory gives you these

54
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:18,580
insane visions and it also is pre,
here's the Jaguar.

55
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,220
It's really crazy.
And this is in the Amazon.

56
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,970
These jaguars eat these plants
and these plants, uh, are they,

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
they have the ingredients of Iowasca
and these jaguars are known to eat these

58
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:33,360
things and then trip
they're fucking balls off.

59
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,060
They eat them and there are pupils dilate
and they roll over on their back and

60
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:39,900
stare at the sky. I mean,
they're clearly high, right?

61
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,940
So this is something that you're going
to say. Yeah, this is one of my say.

62
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,460
So this is what Iowasca is, is
dimethyltryptamine like, look,

63
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,620
it's kind of cool watching
this Jaguar trip balls.

64
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,440
They just stare. They see shit that's
not there. I mean, or it is there.

65
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,710
Maybe there's some still traveling.
It's amazing. So what Iowasca is,

66
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:03,160
is w there's dimethyltryptamine,

67
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:06,490
which is this incredibly
potent psychedelic drug is
produced in the human body.

68
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:09,400
It's produced by the liver.
It's produced by the lungs.

69
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:11,980
And they also believe it's
produced by the pineal gland,

70
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,020
which is literally your third eye.

71
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,180
The pineal gland in certain
reptiles actually has a rep
retina in a lens. I mean,

72
00:04:19,181 --> 00:04:21,670
it's like an eyeball.
And they think,

73
00:04:21,671 --> 00:04:23,920
and the Egyptians called
it the seat of the soul.

74
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,750
And they think that this is
one of the reasons why they're,

75
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,770
they have this obsession with this
gland in eastern mysticism is somehow or

76
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:32,021
another,

77
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:36,580
they figured out that this is the gland
that produces this incredibly potent

78
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:37,414
psychedelic truck.

79
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,950
This psychedelic drug dimethyltryptamine
also exists in thousands of different

80
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:44,440
plants.
The problem is when you consume it orally,

81
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,880
your body produces something in your
gut called model Amy and oxidase and

82
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:50,740
monoamine oxidase breaks it down.

83
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:55,950
So what these indigenous people figured
out is how to combine one plant,

84
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,710
which contains this psychedelic
compound with another plant,

85
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:02,620
which contains a natural Mao
inhibitor called harming.

86
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,950
So they brew this all together,
much like they did with the cassava,

87
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:07,960
which we have no,
no idea how they figured that out.

88
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,200
They brew this stuff up together and
they create this psychedelic t called

89
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:13,060
IOWASCA and Iowasca.

90
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:17,290
Now they have all these trips where
people go down to Peru and take this stuff

91
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:21,610
and trip the fucking balls
off. And this, uh, this,

92
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,310
the combination of these things,
um,

93
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:28,630
leads to this incredibly potent trench,

94
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,860
really transformative experience,
which is impossible to describe.

95
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,670
And that this, this a psychedelic
drug. Why, why didn't I bring that up?

96
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,630
What was what we were talking about
how maybe chimps in are these early

97
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,250
ancestors did something similar,

98
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,000
which pushed them along this
path and starting to communicate,

99
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,230
how do I get to DM tail?
W W how did I get to Ios Guy?

100
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,400
There were a couple of
links in that chain.

101
00:05:50,401 --> 00:05:53,350
Maybe it was because of animals that get
high. That's that. That's what it was.

102
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,260
So this is what this, that's
exactly what it was. It was, yeah.

103
00:05:57,261 --> 00:05:58,130
The Jaguar getting high

104
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,490
on Dmt, that's what they
think the Jaguar is doing.

105
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,150
Just the Jaguar consuming
this stuff. He's, it's making
them trip on DMT in DMTs.

106
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,230
I mean, it's fun. It's really exciting
and variance. So Robert Trevors is,

107
00:06:10,231 --> 00:06:13,760
is wonderful biologist who started a lot
of the kinds of work that we're talking

108
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:17,830
about going in the 70s calls these sorts
of things. A phenotypic intelligence,

109
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,380
right?

110
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,040
So evolution gave you these
pleasure centers in your
brain so that you do what's

111
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:26,330
in your genes, best interests, and kill
the animal or get the girl or whatever.

112
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:27,380
And that makes you feel good.

113
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,590
And so we tend to like the things that
are good for us and dislike the things

114
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:33,480
that are bad for us. We don't want
any feces we do on eat a steak, right?

115
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:37,790
So there's cases like this where it
short circuits that it goes right to the

116
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,340
pleasure center, even though what
it's doing, it's kind of irrelevant.

117
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,940
But this is a case where
maybe it wasn't irrelevant,

118
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,160
maybe it actually caused these animals
to then change the way that they behave

119
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:48,440
to become more sociable.
Right. It's very possible.

120
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,930
Something like that played
a role along the way,

121
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,220
which is why if you replay the sequence,
the vanishing rainforest 10 times,

122
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,770
only one time does it maybe
lead to anything good.

123
00:06:57,771 --> 00:07:02,160
And the other nine times it leads to a
bunch of dead chimps. Yeah. Well the,

124
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:05,840
the process was probably incredibly
slow, right? Over millions of years.

125
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,040
The climate did alter.
