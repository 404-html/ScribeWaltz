1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,030
And it looks at it. How much
trouble are we in? Legitimately?

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,620
I mean it's pretty bad already and it's
going to get, I think a lot, lot worse.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,570
So it's not bad right now. Right here.
It's raining. It seems nice out. The heal.

4
00:00:11,571 --> 00:00:15,040
I mean, how long ago were the fires?
Right, right. Got One back. He waited.

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,220
It was October. Yeah, it was rough.

6
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:21,720
But in all fairness had been evacuated
three times over the past 20 years. Yeah.

7
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:24,840
I know the fires in California fires
are kind of interesting in that, um,

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,260
they both seem like it's like the
future of the apocalypse. They're here,

9
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:33,040
but also it's so familiar from
like decades of wildfires. Um,

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:33,811
but you know,

11
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:36,720
there's scientific estimates that say
that they're going to get by the end of

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,060
the century, 64 times worse. What? Yeah.

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,480
I think that number's a little high
because that would mean more than half of

14
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:46,980
California burning every year. But,
um, I mean, it's going to get, yeah,

15
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,510
it'll get,
it'll get crazy.

16
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,190
And there's no way to avoid any of this
wildfire stuff. Well, I mean, you know,

17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,780
if we don't raise the temperature
of the planet then, but is,

18
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,130
is that the only thing that's
causing wildfire? I mean,

19
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:01,320
like obviously if the temperature raises,

20
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:06,640
there's more brown dry leaves and grass
and stuff like that. But you know,

21
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,090
there's a, there's a lot of
preventative stuff you can do. I mean,

22
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,330
not building in certain areas. Like,
I mean it used to be, you know,

23
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:15,240
the Indians who lived here
before the white people came, um,

24
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,890
did a lot of controlled burning.
They like lived among fires. And, um,

25
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,930
I think that's like a probably
more responsible way to be.

26
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:25,260
But we've now built up the whole state
so that they're all these homes that we

27
00:01:25,261 --> 00:01:27,810
don't want to burn their, all these
properties we don't want to burn.

28
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,670
And when you,
um,

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,630
when you like restrict the
ability of natural fires to burn,

30
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:37,570
that means that like more Tinder gets
built over time and then, you know,

31
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:42,490
at some point some thing lights
the match and it all burns. So,

32
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,700
I mean, you could, um, you
could do more controlled fire,

33
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:48,330
you could take more aggressive
action in terms of, um, you know,

34
00:01:48,331 --> 00:01:50,010
like spraying foam and that kind of thing.

35
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,590
You could have a lot more firefighters,

36
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,270
but I was just talking to a guy yesterday,

37
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:57,090
I'm out here actually doing some
reporting on wildfires and, um,

38
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,040
who is saying that no,

39
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,660
Santa Ana powered wildfire has ever been
stopped by firefighters and he was like,

40
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:06,150
uh, environmental historian. Wow. Um,

41
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,310
it's like you can hope that
the winds redirect them,

42
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:11,130
but like the action of firefighters is
basically just spitting in the wind.

43
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,200
So the action is not to stop. It's a kind
of contain it. Yeah. As best they can.

44
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,870
Yeah. In minimize property
damage. Yeah. But you know,

45
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:22,380
it's hard because you have a lot more,
it's a lot easier to do that when, um,

46
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,000
you know, if the land was totally
raw, you'd be like, Oh, let's,

47
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,960
we'll just like try to direct
the fire in this direction.

48
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:30,950
But if the land is like full of homes
here, like, well, we, can't you,

49
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,470
have you ever seen it live?
Not In person one. Yeah.

50
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:40,510
One time we were filming fear factor
and we were a way up on the five,

51
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,260
like,
um,

52
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,700
probably I would say maybe 75 miles from
here and for a full hour driving about

53
00:02:51,601 --> 00:02:52,770
50 miles an hour,

54
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,370
there was fire on the right hand
side of the road for a full hour.

55
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,060
I mean like Lord of the
rings end of the world,

56
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,740
like you waiting for Satan to come riding
on a burning Phoenix over the top of

57
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:08,620
the hill. It was crazy. I'd never
seen anything like it in my life.

58
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,960
That was the worst one I've ever seen.

59
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,450
But I think that was just
because of placement.

60
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,830
I think that this past one was actually
worse in terms of physical damage and

61
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:22,820
size. It's just, I didn't see it
the way I saw this one. Well, I,

62
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,950
the last year there were,
there were flames, like
hopping over the four oh five,

63
00:03:25,951 --> 00:03:29,850
right? I mean, um, and that's, that's
really like crazy to me because, you know,

64
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,481
I'm a New Yorker.

65
00:03:30,481 --> 00:03:33,870
I've lived my whole life in New
York and I just feel in my bones.

66
00:03:33,871 --> 00:03:35,130
I now know it's sort of not true,

67
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:39,630
but like my inner emotional perspective
on the world is that I live in a

68
00:03:39,631 --> 00:03:42,900
fortress. I don't live in nature. Like
I walked down on concrete streets.

69
00:03:42,901 --> 00:03:45,090
I look up at steel buildings.
Nature can't come from me,

70
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,560
but when you see like fire straddling
the four or five, that's, you know,

71
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,550
this is a major metropolis
here. Um, and we're not safe.

72
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,380
We're certainly not totally safe. Um,
and that's like, for me, that's a major,

73
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,050
like a major revelation I've
had is that wherever you live,

74
00:04:01,051 --> 00:04:02,970
no matter how defended
against nature you are,

75
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,310
climate change is teaching us that,
you know,

76
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,390
you still live within climate and when
it gets fucked up, it will fuck you up.

77
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,280
It will affect you in some
way. Yeah. There was, uh,

78
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,560
the both sides of the four oh five,
we're on fire last year,

79
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:19,910
last year or the year before that, one
of those. But it was insane. It was,

80
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:24,080
it's, it was hitting bel air. And
people are like, well this is this.

81
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,250
We've never seen this before.

82
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,820
I talked to a firefighter
once and this was years ago,

83
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:33,950
and he told me with the right wind,
it's a matter of time for a fire,

84
00:04:33,951 --> 00:04:37,310
hits the top of La and burns all
the way to the ocean. And he goes,

85
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:39,440
and there's not gonna be anything
we could do about it. He goes,

86
00:04:39,441 --> 00:04:43,520
if the right wind catches and a fire
starts at the top of Los Angeles,

87
00:04:43,521 --> 00:04:46,580
it'll just go straight through la.
Look at this.

88
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,550
What does that from Jamie or five
fire. Yeah. Okay. Oh that's it.

89
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:56,130
That's the crazy video.
So this is bel air and the lefthand side.

90
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:01,130
And so these are people driving down
the four oh five looking at, you know,

91
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,280
the most insane site for a place that
has 30 million people or whatever.

92
00:05:06,381 --> 00:05:10,890
La has to see the entire hillside
on fire and bel air up. To me,

93
00:05:10,891 --> 00:05:13,770
Bella is really interesting cause
it's, you know, most climate impacts,

94
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:17,790
they hit the world's poorest
first and like the wildfires are,

95
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,550
they work in the reverse because
it's like people living in the hills,

96
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,650
those are the rich people. But it just
shows you like no matter how rich you are,

97
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,320
no matter how comforted by that wealth
you are like, you know, you might get hit.

98
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,670
Well the best example was
a point Dume yeah. And uh,

99
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,510
we were flying over it.
My friend, uh, Bill uh,

100
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:41,610
has a helicopter license and so we went
around the peak of point Dume it's crazy

101
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:45,980
because you know,
these are like $20 million estates,

102
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,210
these massive bluff side homes.

103
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,980
They thought they were living in the
peak of luxury overviewing the ocean and

104
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:58,340
like, wow, we're on top of the world. And
the fire just scorched it to the ground.

105
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,710
Like that's what it looks like
now. Yeah. That's so crazy.

106
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,050
Well it's really crazy because
you'd like the, they couldn't even,

107
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,130
because people have always said,

108
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,920
oh well they'll protect the rich
folks then in protect these ones.

109
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,650
They can't protect anybody
when it gets this crazy. Yeah.

110
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:14,280
I think they lost more than 600
homes in Malibu alone. Yeah. I mean,

111
00:06:14,281 --> 00:06:18,860
and that's, I mean, yeah. And you think
about Miami beach going underwater. Well,

112
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:23,090
Miami beach is a weird one, right?
Because the ground is porous. Yeah. Yeah.

113
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,220
So it's inevitable to get out of there.

114
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,560
That's basically a sandbar that like some
developers and the 20th decided that,

115
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:32,200
oh, we can make this into a fake paradise.
Oh really? Yeah. I mean, there was, yeah,

116
00:06:32,201 --> 00:06:36,160
it was, um, I mean la is kind of the same
way. Like nobody looking at La in 1850,

117
00:06:36,161 --> 00:06:38,750
it would have said like, here's a
great place to build a city. Um,

118
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,040
but we did it anyway like America and
it's like imperial swagger was like, no,

119
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:46,910
we can create some paradise out of this
completely in his biteable land in both

120
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:49,610
places. And then, you know, it's
just a lesson that like, you know,

121
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,500
it's just a matter of time.
Well,

122
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:54,320
the most cocky people are the people
that have those houses on stilts,

123
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:57,920
on the water in Malibu.
I want,

124
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,420
is this going to work out for you?

125
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,040
Like this thing moves back and forth
over time, and it has forever. I mean,

126
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,350
if you think about like the long,
long sweep of human history,

127
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,700
most human settlements didn't
happen on the coast. Right?
Um, like people lived in,

128
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,840
maybe they live on a river,

129
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,690
maybe you'd have like a little community
on the river, but the, you know,

130
00:07:14,691 --> 00:07:18,170
the last like 50 years, we, a hundred
years we built up, especially in America,

131
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,940
so much more on the coast. And that's
like, you know, really inviting disaster.

132
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:26,180
I mean, all of Houston, like all of
that is like, that was flood plain.

133
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:29,900
That like nature was like, you know, it
was swamp land. It was, and now it's,

134
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:30,201
you know,

135
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:32,990
new suburban developments made out of
concrete and that just means more and more

136
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:33,440
flooding.
