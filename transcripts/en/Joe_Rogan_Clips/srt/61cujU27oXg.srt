1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:00,401
Well,

2
00:00:00,401 --> 00:00:04,180
one of the things that was so interesting
about Australia is that in certain

3
00:00:04,181 --> 00:00:05,860
ways it's a more,
you know,

4
00:00:05,861 --> 00:00:09,850
it's thought of as sort of a macho
culture may be more masculine,

5
00:00:09,851 --> 00:00:14,500
a little bit more conservative than here
generally, and yet the left has one,

6
00:00:14,501 --> 00:00:18,100
they're on so many of the major
issues that we're fighting,

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,220
we're killing each other over now.
Universal healthcare,

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,700
mandatory 401k ninth.

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,390
It's like $18 minimum wage pensions,

10
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,320
four weeks of vacation a year. Like I
think they get maternity leave as well.

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,730
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

12
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,730
It's just like so many of the things
that here are up for grabs they already

13
00:00:36,731 --> 00:00:37,564
solved.

14
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,960
We have to take two things
into consideration. One, um,

15
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,590
that they have a small population,
small in homogenous in its enormous place.

16
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,220
You're dealing with a place as large
as contiguous United States of America,

17
00:00:49,221 --> 00:00:50,310
but there's only 20 million people

18
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,970
because the Whitney, they were like,
it's crowded in that restaurant.

19
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,790
And it was like, you mean I don't
have to wait for an hour to get in?

20
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,930
They had no con they've
never seen a crowd of people.

21
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,810
Yeah.
They don't know what a real crowd is.

22
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:07,020
And also I think their culture is less
constrained by history because they came,

23
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,110
they were essentially prisoners.
I mean they,

24
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:15,220
it's like several generations
removed. Yeah. But it's not,

25
00:01:15,221 --> 00:01:19,160
not only that they not indigenous. No, I
mean like the nonindigenous populations.

26
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,870
Prisoners, yes. Um, yeah.
Well they came from,

27
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,350
they were sent there because England
didn't want him and that's literally how

28
00:01:26,351 --> 00:01:30,310
the country got founded for like stealing
a watch. Like they were low level. Okay,

29
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,960
well then they sent them to the much
better place. Oh yeah. Way Better.

30
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,380
It's an a gold coast. You're like, Holy
Shit. It just takes forever to get,

31
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,800
if you're a Manchester, it's raining every
day and like fuck this place and you,

32
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:44,860
you, you know, you stole a watch and
they shipped you off to the Gold Coast.

33
00:01:44,861 --> 00:01:49,090
You'd be like, what? Which has
happened. This is hilarious.

34
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,810
You fish out here. It's fucking
beautiful. They're nice people.

35
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,480
And I wonder if there,
so nice.

36
00:01:55,690 --> 00:02:00,370
I feel like they are slightly less nice
than Canadians who are way more nice

37
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:01,140
than us.

38
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,380
I think that's right.
I also think that they have,

39
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,920
they have it so good that they're a
little complacent and that makes me

40
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,530
concerned because

41
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,420
China. Okay. Right. That's
like the big story there. Yes.

42
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,590
Yes. I see what you're saying. Yeah.
Well you know, that is to be considered,

43
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:22,710
but I think the United States,
first of all,

44
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:27,711
we have this momentum of
innovation and of ass kicking and,

45
00:02:28,701 --> 00:02:28,991
and,

46
00:02:28,991 --> 00:02:33,030
and getting things done in creating
things that's so different than any other

47
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:36,630
part of the world. If we took that shit
down a notch, I think we'd be okay.

48
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,640
You know, I mean I think we definitely
do have to worry about China and we,

49
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,310
you know,

50
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,310
I've been really trying to closely
follow all this wowway stuff where these

51
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,070
executives keep getting
arrested and you know,

52
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:55,390
it's the close relationship between
some tech companies and this communist

53
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,560
government is very confusing.
But some people look it over.

54
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,740
Like if you talk to people that are
Chinese natives or who have been to China,

55
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,520
they almost look it as a positive.
There's less resistance. It's more,

56
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,380
even though the censorship is open,

57
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,220
it's at least you know what you're
dealing with over there as opposed to,

58
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,980
you know,
the NSA is spying on us.

59
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,880
Oh,
I don't buy it at all.

60
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,140
I've seen some people make that argument
and it's horrifying. Weird. It's weird.

61
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,740
It's horrifying.
Yeah.

62
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,670
Great. I agree with you. You
do have to worry about China,

63
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:30,180
but I think Australia is like, ah, it's
fucking Americans to take care of it.

64
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,800
That's how they think sorta,

65
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,870
except like their situation is
that they're enormously economic.

66
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,970
They're enormously dependent on China
economically and they love having that

67
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,170
money.
Uh,

68
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,200
but they seem to be a little bit like
sleep walking through history and not is

69
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,200
at least some people that I spoke to it.
But that's,

70
00:03:52,201 --> 00:03:54,930
that's the real story
in Australia is China.

71
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,890
Yeah. Well I think when you're,
you're not a military might, you know,

72
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:01,870
you're not like one of the big players.

73
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,050
You're kind of like sitting back watching
because what are we going to do? Like,

74
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:10,051
what if Australia decides to ramp up its
defense budget by 5000% over the next

75
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:15,271
10 years and develop a crazy arsenal
of weapons and super soldiers and shoot

76
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:19,600
them all up with steroids and give them
exoskeletons and get ready to go to war,

77
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,420
start building bunkers, right, and
freak the rest of the world out.

78
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:26,020
I mean this and take this like North
Korea with money approach to the world.

79
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,140
If any man in North Korea with money.
Well,

80
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:32,740
North Korea is basically like this
scary spot that nobody wants to invade,

81
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:37,400
even though we know that
there's a military dictatorship
there. They have, yeah,

82
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,300
they have nuclear weapons.
They have a mad man who's in control.

83
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,510
They have people that escaped
with horrific stories and
we have a president who

84
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:46,720
talks about them as if they're sort
of a normal country. Yeah. Well,

85
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,140
in the weird thing is like he might be
able to sit down with them and actually

86
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:54,040
talked to them as his unconventional
approach might actually lead to some sort

87
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:58,070
of communication at least. Which is
better than nothing, I guess. But,

88
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,280
but if,
I don't mean like in North Korea,

89
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:02,920
like they take over the country
and in prison it's people,

90
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,640
I mean like there they become kind
of dangerous and sketchy and small.

91
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,250
Like North Korea is not
a military Dick Power.

92
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,550
Like in terms of like the way the Soviet
Union is where they could take over the

93
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:16,270
world, but they're scary but they're
untouchable and that's scary. Exactly.

94
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:19,780
If Australia became that then I think we
have a totally different attitude about

95
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:21,940
Australia. No, Australia.
Yeah, we don't, yeah,

96
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:23,830
Australia is just laid
back and they're like,

97
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:28,300
Hey Americans a take care of it and then
we're over here building fucking walls

98
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:31,230
and shooting missiles. Um, yeah. I,

99
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,440
I would imagine it would be really
weird to watch us from afar. You know,

100
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,260
if you were paying
attention to world politics,

101
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,870
they know everything. I mean
everyone I talked to there was like,

102
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:45,560
let's talk about gerrymandering in
Virginia. And I'm like, what? Like what,

103
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:50,110
what do you say that simply
follow what's going on here?

104
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:52,870
And the way that I found kind of amazing,

105
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,120
like genuinely actually
Gerrymandering, good Virginia. I was,

106
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,150
I would move over there. Don't you
often knew it was going on for a year.

107
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,760
You know the answer is sort of note.
Yeah. Comedians move over there.

108
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,010
They move over there and
become huge in Australia.

109
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,710
Shout out to my friend ards barker.
