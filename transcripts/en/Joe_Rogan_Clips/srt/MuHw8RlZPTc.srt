1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,190
I went hunting for big foot for a
television show I did for Scifi.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,670
I called Joe Rogan questions, everything.
And we went looking for bigfoot.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,670
And the more I talk to
these big foot folks,

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,560
the more I was convinced none of these
motherfuckers had ever seen bigfoot until

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:17,430
there's one lady that I talked to, one
lady who just did not seem like a liar.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,570
And she was telling me that she saw
something in the woods and it was standing

7
00:00:21,571 --> 00:00:25,110
up and it was tall, like seven,
eight feet tall. And she's like,

8
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:29,610
why is there a gorilla in the woods?
And then she's like, oh my God,

9
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:33,270
that's pig foot. And they shed and
it was a Pacific northwest, uh,

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,110
outside of a Washington state or in
Washington state, outside of Seattle.

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,450
And the woods are so dense up there that
if anything goes 10, 20 feet, it's gone.

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,020
The problem with that is that there's
black bears up there and black bear

13
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:48,270
sometimes stand up on two feet.
They do it all the time.

14
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:51,540
And if you saw a black foot,
especially a black bear rather,

15
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:52,830
especially from a distance,

16
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,620
you would think it was a big gorilla
if he was standing up on two feet,

17
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:58,020
which they do do, especially when
they're trying to see something,

18
00:00:58,021 --> 00:00:59,640
they'll stand up and they'll even walk.

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,610
There's a lot of videos of them walking
on two feet and just on the right career

20
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,880
they seen it.
That's crazy.

21
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:10,080
I could see a big 400% so I think,

22
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,400
I don't think that lady is a liar. I
just don't, she might, let me look.

23
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,800
It might be real.
There might be a few of them left.

24
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,300
There definitely was a thing called
gigantic [inaudible] that lived in Asia.

25
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,930
And the thought is that it came across
the Bering land bridge the same time that

26
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,620
native Americans came across from Asia
and that they came across and you know,

27
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,990
cause they lived in Asia and this,

28
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:35,400
this gigantic [inaudible]
I think lived as recently,

29
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,550
I think as a hundred thousand
years ago. I think the, the,

30
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:41,610
the most recent fossils they
have of it, which is, you know,

31
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:46,320
human beings were alive back then.
And this thing was a six or a,

32
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,060
an eight to 10 foot tall bipedal hominid.
So it was a huge,

33
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,380
huge ape like creature. So check this
out. This is a look at this. Bear

34
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,950
to the craziest shit ever. Bears
walking on two legs. I look at him. Wow.

35
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,110
Like if you saw that, you'd
be like, totally. Yeah.
Yeah. You can just feel like,

36
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,990
oh my God, it's a fuck his pig foot.
Especially if you believe the hype,

37
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:15,300
your search for big foot out there. Yes.
Or if you're on shrooms. Yeah. Right.

38
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,970
I mean, if you're walking around, if
you're high on mushrooms, you're like,

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,780
oh my God, Beth, what's real? Leave that
thing. He's like, hey, how you doing? Oh,

40
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:23,820
he's got to hurt. Right
foot. That's what that is.

41
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,570
You see his right foot or something wrong
with his right foot sometimes. Yeah.

42
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:30,720
It looks like he's missing his front.
Pollatos sometimes. Um, you know,

43
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:35,721
bears will fight with each other and one
barrel bite the other bears foot off or

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,140
he could have gotten shot or it could
have broke it off on something. Yeah.

45
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,810
That's crazy. Yeah. He's
missing a foot. So He's,

46
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,490
he's walking around out there like a
gorilla, but everybody else, I was like,

47
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,120
wow, I'm talking to them. They're
like living in make believe world.

48
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,020
Here's another one. Walking around. I
look at him. Wow. That is weird, man.

49
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,470
Those are big as bears to big Asbestos
Hill on two feet. I mean, look,

50
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,230
they look like fucking people,
man.

51
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,150
I think that is a big reason why.
And then they're feeding them.

52
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,130
That is so crazy. Where is that?
That doesn't seem like America.

53
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,330
South Korea. Is it South
Korea? Yeah. Wow. Oh,

54
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,070
so that's one of those wildlife parks
where the animals are all and you're in a

55
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:25,070
car. Yeah. That's like fake
wildlife. I mean wildlife,

56
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,200
but not really wild.
