1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,750
Try My day,
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,900
But for people that don't know what
we're going to about to be talking about,

3
00:00:06,901 --> 00:00:09,740
you had one of the most horrific injuries,

4
00:00:09,741 --> 00:00:13,350
streaks in the sport in your prime,
you know,

5
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:16,320
you were considered to be one of the top
pound for pound fighters in the world

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,430
and then you had a series of
catastrophic injuries and surgeries.

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,310
So for this is for a lot of people
listen to his podcast and aren't really

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,830
hardcore MMA fans.

9
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:30,030
That makes so you like talk us through
it because you went through like one of

10
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:35,130
the most difficult trials in terms
of recovery from injury. Any, no,

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,960
the most difficult I've ever seen anybody
go through in the entire history of my

12
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:42,090
time of colon fights.
Well for fighting.

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,240
I definitely agree in the sport of then
it fell off cause I researched him.

14
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,030
Oh okay.

15
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,450
These guys who went through three ACL
reconstructions came back and compete it

16
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,520
and one of them was just competing.
Uh Oh.

17
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,960
They almost made it to the Superbowl and
he had three ACL reconstructions in the

18
00:00:57,961 --> 00:00:59,070
game of football and came back,

19
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,540
was still playing and he was like over
there over 30 miles and people like that

20
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,230
need to be around in this world. Sure.
Just to let you know that it's possible,

21
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:11,310
you know that it can be done and
now it's kind of what I what gay.

22
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:15,420
That mindset right there when you make
it bigger than yourself is the only way

23
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:17,970
you get the power to get through stuff
like that and that's what got me through

24
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:22,320
is understanding that I go through
this, these knees, surgeries, I I,

25
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,070
I become, it becomes bigger than
me when I come back and succeed.

26
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,070
It's not just about me coming back
and get my belt. I already had belts.

27
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,120
I already knew what it felt like to be a
five time world champion. By that point,

28
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,380
at the age of 26 before I blew my
knee out, I was on top of everything.

29
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:41,400
I had everything that I thought I
needed and wanted, blew my knee out,

30
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,850
get my belt stripped,
go through three ACL reconstructions.

31
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:48,900
You soon find out that you
actually have no idea who you are,

32
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,300
what, no. What was the
initial injury? Uh, ACL, MCL.

33
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,590
What, what, what happened though?

34
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,700
I was a training while I was getting ready
and the ultimate fighter back in 2012

35
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:06,450
or 11 for Faber fight. We're getting
ready to compete at the end of the show.

36
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,780
And I was training with a guy and it was
just a hard week. I mean we're, we're,

37
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,330
we were the first show that ever went
live and was training for the fight at the

38
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:17,310
same time. Uh, being tough.

39
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,640
We're the only first and
only live show that they did.

40
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,310
So that meant that Lao we coached,

41
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:25,800
we were also going to
compete at the same time.

42
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,790
So like I had to do my fight camp while
I trained the ultimate fighter guys

43
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,260
simultaneously.
So I was doing four practices a day,

44
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,280
two at the tough guys and two with myself.

45
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,460
And that work load was just insane.

46
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,590
That was a hard heart training camp
and ended up breaking me down, um,

47
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,520
hurt my knee,
just sparring.

48
00:02:44,521 --> 00:02:49,290
It was a spine day guy went for grappling
transition and my and a Sagd on my hip.

49
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,510
Weird and just blew my
knee out a crappy takedown.

50
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,440
You know where they sag
instead of actually get the
take down and it just blew

51
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:59,290
my knee out. When I blew my ACL MCL,
I was. I was like, it's all right.

52
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,520
You'll be fine. I fought it. I almost
literally fought the injury like,

53
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,220
you're too tough. You're too strong.
You're too young. You can do this.

54
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,550
Let's go fuck the injury. Meaning
not get surgery and try to rehab it.

55
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:13,200
You just heard what I just said,
like it didn't mentally right.

56
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:17,740
Did the surgery I did. That wasn't
the problem though. That's my point.

57
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,640
The problem isn't if you're doing
all the things right to get better.

58
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:27,420
It's understanding that it
was understanding that I
didn't need to fight to be

59
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:29,044
better

60
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,610
giving up on it was when I
finally got better understanding.

61
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:37,780
I didn't need fighting to be who I was.
When you say get better,

62
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:42,310
you mean get better emotionally,
psychologically walk physically,

63
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,470
even physically. Physically. I didn't.

64
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,410
I did not get better until I
gave up on fighting the injury.

65
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:51,280
And what I mean by fighting the
injuries saying it's, you'll be fine.

66
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,920
You'll come back, just keep training, keep
training, keep training, keep training.

67
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,780
And I, and I trained, but in the, in the,

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,150
the logic that I was given with my,
uh,

69
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,780
with what I'm allowed to do according to
my physical therapist, Gavin Macmillan,

70
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:08,050
he would say, you can do this, this and
this. Don't push it. I wouldn't push it.

71
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,160
I would do the things aloud, but I'm
telling you, like that wasn't the issue.

72
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:14,550
The issue was surrendering the f the,

73
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,550
the issue is knowing that fighting was
the only way I was going to be happy then

74
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:22,750
it was being able to compete with
the only way I could find peace.

75
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:24,790
Being able to prove that I
was as good as I always was,

76
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:29,710
even after the injuries became
everything that I was trying to do. Um,

77
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,270
it, it was just a nonstop
fight to just get healthy.

78
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:40,050
And I get through my second
ACL reconstruction on the
same knee and then I blow

79
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:44,210
my quad out before I was
supposed to fight him.

80
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,750
How did you blow out the second one?
You had the injury,

81
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:49,690
you had a reconstructed and then
how do you blow out the second one?

82
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,800
It's the same knee and I was training
on Christmas how many months after the

83
00:04:56,801 --> 00:05:01,090
initial surgery? Six. So it's real
reason. It's probably not 100% healed yet.

84
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:04,870
It's not 100% healed yet.
Nine months is supposed to be full,

85
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,170
full strength,
but that,

86
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:12,180
but six months is when you get to
start pushing it to get ready to fall.

87
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,860
So now you're like six
months to six months.

88
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:19,480
You're not allowed to do any kind of
cutting Connie meaning lateral movements

89
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,070
just straight down the line. No,
nothing risky. Uh, keep your brace on.

90
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:26,830
When you trained out in a six month
mark, they're like, take the brace off.

91
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:28,660
You've got to start getting
the stabilizers strong.

92
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,090
You can start testing it more.
You can start doing things,

93
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:34,690
but you still got to where, where
your brace when you do live scenarios.

94
00:05:34,691 --> 00:05:37,060
But you can drill without it.
You can, you see what I'm saying?

95
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,440
So you're actually pretty strong,

96
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,860
but now it's supposed to be strong
enough that it's not going to tear.

97
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,800
But that's when I had a cadaver ACL.

98
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,940
So it wasn't as strong as it should have
been at that, at that six month point,

99
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:50,220
because it was cadaver tissue.

100
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,160
My Body did not adapt to the
tissue as well as it could have.

101
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,300
So do they do an Mri to see where it's
at or did they just kind of base it on

102
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,193
how it feels?

103
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,820
They base it on the endpoint and the
stability of your knee and they manipulate

104
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:06,860
it when they manipulate it.
At the six month mark,

105
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:10,880
you're going in every two to three weeks
for six months to double check with the

106
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:13,040
doc. I've had to have a
two reconstructions. Well,

107
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:16,520
I was doing that at Kerlan and Jobe and
they were good doctors and they tried to

108
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:20,420
stay on me, you know? Um, so
you've had two. So, you know,

109
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:25,830
and you know at the six month mark it's
like you can push it but you don't want

110
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:30,350
to overkill it cause you to tear it. So
the second one, I wasn't over killing it,

111
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:34,400
but I was doing what I was
allowed in my brace and I made it,

112
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,600
I made a cut like a turn and
it just popped it just like,

113
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:43,250
it wasn't anything like, oh I
shouldn't have been doing that.

114
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,540
It was kind of like, you know, I was
boxing in my brace. I had it taped,

115
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,460
I warmed up, I, I was uh, doing
drills, boxing drills, those drills.

116
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,170
Yeah, boxing drills. But you just pivot
wrong then and it just pops. And then,

117
00:06:57,171 --> 00:06:59,740
you know, like I remember
sitting there and I'd just,

118
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:04,220
the pain is very specific and then it goes
away too quick. That's when, you know,

119
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,710
cause it's their real,
real, real, real hard pain.

120
00:07:06,711 --> 00:07:09,390
And then it goes away in like two
minutes because the ligaments like,

121
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:14,000
so now you don't have pain anymore. And
I'm like, oh no. So I sit down and I go,

122
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,170
all right,
my is torn.

123
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,770
And that was when I hit like a
real bad rock bottom on that one.

124
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,550
That was like that one.
Like oh my gosh.

125
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:24,200
When I went to the MRI and got home,

126
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:28,550
I literally like called my friend and
I told him to come over and I just,

127
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,300
I mean I pretty much just drink as
much of a bottle. It's that good.

128
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:34,760
Cause I was in pretty good shape
at that point. So I put me out,

129
00:07:34,761 --> 00:07:38,810
I passed out of my head was I woke up
in my porch with my head on the grill in

130
00:07:38,811 --> 00:07:41,480
the morning, just a mess. It
was not, it was not pretty,

131
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,080
but I didn't care cause I was
out for nine months, you know.

132
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,260
So everybody hits these
lows, you know, it's normal.

133
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,010
What were you doing financially back then?
Because that's where it gets rough.

134
00:07:52,011 --> 00:07:56,440
Right. That's another part of it. I mean
us athletes, we all know, or you know, uh,

135
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:01,040
we, we only make money when we, when we
fight for the prize, you know, and, um,

136
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,190
thank God, you know,
Lorenzo and in the UFC,

137
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:08,270
they gave me a decent chunk of money
for a good part of time while I had the

138
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:10,280
belt.
And then once they took the belt,

139
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,530
I stopped getting that chunk
of money even when I was hurt.

140
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:15,350
So they were paying me a little
bit a stipend while I was hurt.

141
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,690
And that helped me.
And then when I lot,

142
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:20,240
when they stripped the belt and gave
it to Brown, they stopped with that,

143
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,570
you know, cause I'm not the champion
anymore. And then it was kind of like,

144
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,440
that's one, that's what I mean.
That's when it kind of went,

145
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,500
got turned me out here. Like, you're
not the champ, um, on paper anymore.

146
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,200
He didn't really lose it, but that's
it. So what are you going to do?

147
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,650
What is this it, you know, how you gonna
make money? How are you going to do this?

148
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:39,230
How are you going to do
that? And I panicked. Um,

149
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:44,060
but I knew that I was going to still come
back and fight cause I was still young

150
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,850
and so I hadn't given up on fighting yet.
Still only in my second ACL surgery.

151
00:08:47,851 --> 00:08:52,851
So I'm still not fully admitting
that I'm not that I'm a mess.

152
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:57,660
Right. I kind of not really like
admitting it to myself yet and it's,

153
00:08:57,661 --> 00:08:59,520
screw what you're saying everybody
else's what I'm trying to say.

154
00:08:59,521 --> 00:09:03,900
It's what you believed yourself
is all that matters. Right.
Period. And I was like,

155
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:07,830
I'll be fine. This isn't that bad. I,
I can do this. I've gone through worse.

156
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,710
So in doing it, I still hadn't really just
given up yet and that's, so I'm still,

157
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,650
I'm still competing in my mind,
which is the problem.

158
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,410
And that's when you just,

159
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:23,670
you're overworking and not
just doing things you're not
supposed to on your knee.

160
00:09:23,671 --> 00:09:26,880
But just in general in
life on just overworking.

161
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,440
I'm doing my Fox stuff now to make money
and then I'm trying to do my rehab five

162
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:34,560
days a week because I have to come back
and fight for the belt when I come back.

163
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:37,870
And that's another thing people
don't equate is I was the champs.

164
00:09:37,871 --> 00:09:40,380
I got to come back and fight for the belt.
When I come back after this injury,

165
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:43,380
I don't just get to come back
and fight somebody three rounds.

166
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,890
I got to come back and fight five rounds.
Never been done before.

167
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:51,510
I had nobody to bounce this thought
off of. Um, I just had to wing it man.

168
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,110
And so I was, and that caused, I think,

169
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:58,410
a lot of problems with me cause I didn't
have the mental capacity to deal with

170
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:02,670
it at that point with all the things that
I was doing. So I just kept grinding.

171
00:10:02,671 --> 00:10:06,180
And then I finally get back to
health after the second ACL,

172
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:12,290
six months, nine months goes by. All
right, let's take this brow fight song.

173
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:15,870
I'm ready. I'm training and
camp about a month in, um,

174
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,290
I th I have like a
weird pinch in my groin.

175
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,220
It turns out to be the exact same injury
Daniel Cormier just pulled out of the

176
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:27,570
fight for it's the extensor tendon
in your or no, it's the, um,

177
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,360
uh,
I forget the name of the,

178
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,720
there's a tendon in your groin area that
pulls and then you got to just rest it.

179
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:38,860
I tore the, mine was a little
bit worse. I tore the bone,

180
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:43,170
the muscle, the quad muscle off the
bone, so it like separated from the bone,

181
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,990
but it wasn't all the way.
It was just enough that it was,

182
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:51,000
I could still like think I was okay,
but it would just fail on me occasionally,

183
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:54,300
so I could tape it some days and it would
be all right. Shoot a bunch of Toradol,

184
00:10:54,301 --> 00:10:56,890
which is a, for anybody
who's curious. It's a natch.

185
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:01,740
It's a legal anti-inflammatory. A
lot of football players take it. Um,

186
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:06,000
toradol. Toridol it's uh,
yeah, I think that's, yeah,

187
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:08,280
I think that's what it's
called. But anyways, it's,

188
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,160
it's a natural urge to anti-inflammatory.
None natural one,

189
00:11:11,161 --> 00:11:15,690
but it's like Ibuprofen, but stronger.
And I would take that and that helped. Um,

190
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,260
but it just, it wasn't right.

191
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,800
I remember I was sparring one day and
I went to throw a right hand and my leg

192
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:26,520
just gave out and I fell on the floor
and it wasn't kicking, I wasn't shooting.

193
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,020
I just threw her right hand and the
feeling of falling because I threw right

194
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:33,690
hand made me know like
something wasn't connected.

195
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,260
Like it just didn't feel right
because it just failed me. It wasn't,

196
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:41,280
it wasn't like it hurt and I stopped it
just literally there was no pain and it

197
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:45,390
just failed. And I was like, something's
way mechanically wrong with me.

198
00:11:45,391 --> 00:11:47,880
I can't fight mechanically
wrong like this.

199
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:50,400
And that was about four weeks
out of the fight, three,

200
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:53,890
four weeks out of the fight. Why had
already done a month camp, this injury,

201
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,110
trying to tough it out.
So my camp was rough.

202
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:59,740
It was a heart camp and I didn't want
to pull out, obviously naturally.

203
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,230
So I ended up calling Dana fee and,

204
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,050
and this one of the few phone
calls I've ever had with Dana,

205
00:12:05,051 --> 00:12:07,660
unfortunately in this, probably one of
the Times you remembers telling them,

206
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:09,340
I'm sorry I've got to pull out.

207
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,370
But I remember not wanting to
have my manager column this,

208
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:13,870
this goes back to what my mom,

209
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,950
how my mom puts something in my head
where you deal with this face to face or

210
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,440
talk in cycle. And I said,
look, I don't want to do this,

211
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:23,170
but I got a plot of this
fight. I need some doc. I need,

212
00:12:23,171 --> 00:12:26,170
if you got any doctors you can have him,
the Mri me whenever you want,

213
00:12:26,171 --> 00:12:29,140
but I'm telling you something's wrong
with my leg. So he's like, okay, I'll,

214
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:31,630
I'll do it. I got, I got guys on
it. We can't have you pull out now.

215
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,970
I'm sure you're fine. Check it out.
Get the doctors, check it. Yeah, your,

216
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,210
your quads torn. You can't fight.
So the UFC pulls me, you know,

217
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,080
Dane is naturally pissed, but then
that slide's a favor in there. Boom.

218
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,760
Favorite gets the shot with,

219
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:48,400
with brow ends up getting knocked
out in that match up. But um,

220
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,250
I pull out of that fight and
that's when they stripped my belt.

221
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:56,380
And then that was the beginning of me
giving up on fighting to an extent.

222
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,870
And what I mean by that is it's different
than you think. It sounds negative,

223
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:03,580
right? When you say that
I'm giving up on fighting,

224
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,260
but it is actually the building point
in my life where I finally let go of

225
00:13:08,261 --> 00:13:09,094
control.

226
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,760
I always had this thing up to that point
where I wanted to control everything.

227
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,430
It's just something that I,

228
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:20,550
I always had to give to being able
to do this last one after the two ACL

229
00:13:21,371 --> 00:13:25,240
reconstructive surgery is coming back
and then tearing my quad after that.

230
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:27,850
I said like,
I don't know what else you want me to do.

231
00:13:27,851 --> 00:13:31,750
I've gotten through two
ACL reconstructions. Uh,
my higher power is God.

232
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,570
So I'm praying at this point saying,
I don't know what you want me to do.

233
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,550
So you're talking to God. So yeah, like
what do I gotta do, man? I'm you want,

234
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,430
I'm, I'm in this for for
reasons bigger than myself.

235
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,760
I want to come back and show
people that this can be done.

236
00:13:45,761 --> 00:13:48,340
I'm not the only one that can do
this. Anybody can do this, right?

237
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,300
I'm here for you doing bidding your wheel.
God,

238
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,380
this is my talking and no answers,
no nothing.

239
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,770
And I said,
maybe that's the answer.

240
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,670
I remember thinking maybe that's the
answer is just you might not ever fight

241
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:06,730
again. Are you okay with that?
And now it's something that my,

242
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:11,910
I never allowed my brain to even go to
ever until all these injuries hit me and

243
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:14,710
I would have never been able to
unless I went through all that.

244
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,040
That was literally all this stuff because
I'm so stubborn and so just tough that

245
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:23,830
I had to go through all that
just to mentally say, okay,

246
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,070
you might never do this again.
It could have been if to the first one,

247
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:30,850
I could have done that, but
I didn't. When I did that,

248
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,510
my health skyrocketed immediately.
I started,

249
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,870
I just went to therapy every day
knowing I was trying to get better,

250
00:14:37,871 --> 00:14:39,400
but I didn't care if
I fought again or not.

251
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:44,380
I focused all my energy and Fox and
coaching the guys at Alliance Training

252
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,980
Center and make them better and uh, try
to make the team better so that when and,

253
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:53,090
and feed off the thirst and the hunger
that those guys had to be the champion

254
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:57,680
that I still wanted to be. And I, and
I, I decided that if I focused on Fox,

255
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,680
focused on the positive energy
of these guys at the gym,

256
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,180
kept training and kept
my mind in the sport, um,

257
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:09,300
my body will be there because my
age is compliant with my body still.

258
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:11,660
I'm still young enough that I'll be okay.

259
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,010
So I just needed to get my mind wrapped
around the sport, stay in it immensely,

260
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,770
but understand that if I never
have it again, that's okay too.

261
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,270
And when I did that,

262
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:25,330
it took away so much importance off of
needing to fight as have the title as my,

263
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,260
as the person that I was,
that it allowed me to open up and say,

264
00:15:30,261 --> 00:15:32,090
if you never fight again and
you're still a great person,

265
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:34,600
you still did great things. You still, uh,

266
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,110
laid the tracks for the Bantam Weight
Division and a lot of ways, um,

267
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,610
you did this, that you, you
had a great career. Dumb,
like it's okay if this is it.

268
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,640
And I kept that mindset,

269
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,420
kept focusing on the things that I could
control instead of the things that I

270
00:15:50,421 --> 00:15:52,820
couldn't,
like the fact that I wasn't competing yet.

271
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,820
And as I did that I got
healthier and healthier.

272
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,690
Came back thought Mizzou Gawky that
set me up to fight Mizzou gawky then

273
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,400
destroyed misery gawky while your best
performances over where I found great

274
00:16:04,401 --> 00:16:05,750
first round destruction,

275
00:16:05,751 --> 00:16:09,380
that was a most at peace I've felt
in a long time walking into her and I

276
00:16:09,381 --> 00:16:11,510
remember interviewing you after
the fight and you were like,

277
00:16:11,511 --> 00:16:15,020
I don't even remember what happened. He
just went like, you went into a trance.

278
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:15,883
It was weird.

279
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,900
It was one of the weirdest performances
in my whole career easily because the

280
00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:25,580
walkout was different.
Just I was so, I had no,

281
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:29,930
no connection. I was, I had no connection
to the win or the loss at that point.

282
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,300
There was nothing.
It was just,

283
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:36,450
I was just there to enjoy being there
again after three and a half years and all

284
00:16:36,451 --> 00:16:39,890
of these injuries like I can't believe
I made it here. I'm not injured.

285
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:45,140
And I remember thinking like,
just you're in front of these people.

286
00:16:45,141 --> 00:16:48,350
Enjoy the limelight, man. Enjoy
this ride. Like this is incredible.

287
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,860
There's people that would pay millions
and trillions of dollars to get this walk

288
00:16:51,861 --> 00:16:55,610
you're about to get and go fight
somebody in this octagon. Just enjoy it.

289
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,690
Don't worry, don't connect. And by letting
go, man, by letting go of the injuries,

290
00:16:59,691 --> 00:17:02,360
by letting go of the wind,
by letting go of the loss,

291
00:17:02,361 --> 00:17:05,040
by letting go of either mattered.
I was in the,

292
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:09,630
I was in my zone and it allowed
me to just be free and I was,

293
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,350
that was the best performance of
my career. But more than anything,

294
00:17:12,351 --> 00:17:17,351
it showed me a mental thing that I'd
never opened up before and it was letting

295
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:20,600
go of the things that you can't control.

296
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:26,550
We'll give you actually more peace because
it disconnects you from what happens.

297
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:32,870
So you feel like that piece was a
significant factor in your body recovering

298
00:17:32,871 --> 00:17:36,260
cause the pressure and the
stress and the anxiety,

299
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,050
all of that was playing.
It was,

300
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:42,980
it was wrecking not just your mental
state but also your physical state.

301
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,210
100% every piece of it. That's really
interesting. Every piece of it.

302
00:17:47,211 --> 00:17:50,850
And that's the biggest thing I
learned is, uh, that is like,

303
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:54,510
it wasn't my physical body, it was
my mind doing it to my physical body.

304
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:58,620
So it was initially a physical
injury and then it was the cascade of

305
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,750
psychological issues that came with the
physical issue that was more physical

306
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:04,230
issues.

307
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:09,230
It was the cascade of trying to figure
out why I was so sad with all these

308
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:13,710
things that I earned around me that I
already had everything that I thought like

309
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,350
when you grow up in a trailer like I did,
and then you go to winning a Gtr,

310
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:24,330
the car you wanted since you were a kid
in a prize fight and having a home that

311
00:18:24,331 --> 00:18:27,360
you bought with your own money that you
never thought you'd be able to own a

312
00:18:27,361 --> 00:18:30,360
home in California. Cause you live in
a damn trailer park in Tucson, Arizona.

313
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:35,490
It kind of like, um, makes you feel like,

314
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,700
like that's it, you know, like you, you,

315
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:43,660
you've done crazy great
things and you've, um, I,

316
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:48,780
those were all just dreams to me and they
happened so quick, like at 20, you know,

317
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:52,380
I mean, I didn't get my house till
later, but when I got those things,

318
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,830
it's like I really, I, why are you
so I was still sad as my point.

319
00:18:55,831 --> 00:18:59,220
Like I was still, I had my
depression that was hitting me and,

320
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,310
and that's so many people in this
world are dealing with depression.

321
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:06,000
Like it's a huge catastrophic
problem across the planet.

322
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:11,400
And um, I definitely, it's
in my, it's in my blood line,

323
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:14,100
on both sides of my family.
And it's something that everybody,

324
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:18,090
not just myself deals with on a daily
basis, I think in certain people's lives.

325
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:22,620
And that hit me very hard and I didn't
understand why it hit me so much harder

326
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:26,400
now after I stopped competing.
Like, why am I, why is,

327
00:19:26,401 --> 00:19:28,920
why is it so much worse now?
While.

328
00:19:28,921 --> 00:19:33,690
The reason is my body was used to
the active, the activity just go, go,

329
00:19:33,691 --> 00:19:37,770
go. And I, what I realized is
I turned off all my emotional,

330
00:19:37,771 --> 00:19:42,450
spiritual and mental issues with
exercise to where I never ever,

331
00:19:42,451 --> 00:19:46,980
ever dealt with them ever.
I only physically worked them out.

332
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:51,900
So my physical was perfection.
I was a, I'm a world champion,

333
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:57,150
monster, killer, whatever you want to call
me in your own respective mind, right?

334
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:01,020
But emotionally,
physically and spiritually,

335
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:05,820
I was at cricket and I never
understood that until I was hurt,

336
00:20:05,821 --> 00:20:10,020
trapped in my own body like a prison
cell, couldn't train, couldn't run,

337
00:20:10,021 --> 00:20:14,880
couldn't walk, couldn't bend my leg,
laying on the couch, eating pain pills,

338
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:19,170
realizing, man, unless you train,
unless you compete, you hate yourself,

339
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,380
you hate yourself. You're, you're
a piece of shit in your own mind.

340
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,560
Without those things,
without the beautiful girlfriend,

341
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,170
without the beautiful house,
without the Nice cars,

342
00:20:28,171 --> 00:20:31,710
without them big money to
show people you hate yourself.

343
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,580
So what am I really doing?
Why am I doing this?

344
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,500
I lost sight that the whole reason
we're fighting is, is it's a spiritual,

345
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:41,640
emotional,
physical,

346
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:45,360
mental battle that helps you grow as
an individual and as a human being.

347
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,610
It's not just to have these things
you think will make you happy.

348
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,280
You have to learn those
things through the process.

349
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:55,060
And I didn't know that until I was trapped
in my own body and I literally felt

350
00:20:55,061 --> 00:20:57,850
like I was in a prison cell
and I knew that wasn't right.

351
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:03,600
We shouldn't be in our own body alone
without people around us to keep us

352
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:08,560
company and uh, on a couch feeling
like we're in a prison cell,

353
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:13,270
should we? No, definitely not. No we
shouldn't. But I did for three years.

354
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:16,970
So how did you get yourself out of it?
By just accepting it and you, you ma,

355
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:21,280
there must have been some sort of a
mechanism that August I have people that I

356
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,850
talked to, professionals, um,

357
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,580
obviously like sports
psychologists or wall,

358
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,770
a sports psychologist and then you got
to get a psychologist in general to deal

359
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:34,630
with the depression, whatever. When you
hit your lows like it's okay to, to get,

360
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:39,040
you know, if you're bench pressing 350
pounds, it's okay to have a little touch.

361
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,170
It's okay to have a little
spot here and there, you know,

362
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:45,370
and then after you get a couple spots,
now after a while you can do it yourself.

363
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:46,540
You don't need the spot anymore.

364
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,990
That's how I look at psychiatric
help to an extent. For some people,

365
00:21:49,991 --> 00:21:51,460
especially if they're battling depression.

366
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:54,700
Sometimes you just need a floaty and you
did and then you can take the floaties

367
00:21:54,701 --> 00:21:58,120
off after a year. See what
I'm saying? It's a mental,

368
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,430
it's a mental floaty and it's okay cause
we all hit low part low points in our

369
00:22:03,431 --> 00:22:07,450
life where it's unbearable and you either
allow it to continue to be unbearable

370
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,220
and just deny it.
Or you deal with the task at hand and say,

371
00:22:10,221 --> 00:22:14,050
I'm a little low right now.
I need the floaties. It's
okay, I'll get through this.

372
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,610
And then when you take the flood is off,

373
00:22:15,611 --> 00:22:18,700
you realize I only needed them for a
little bit of time and now I'm okay,

374
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:21,070
I'm here.
And that's kind of what it felt like.

375
00:22:21,071 --> 00:22:23,200
It's like I just needed
a little bit of a push.

376
00:22:23,201 --> 00:22:26,680
I needed to get through this and
learn some things about my own,

377
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:32,140
my own mind and understand my own emotions
and understand that I didn't need all

378
00:22:32,141 --> 00:22:34,030
these things that I was
thinking where it real.

379
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:36,520
It was me not being in
control of my own emotions,

380
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,710
your own emotions or your choice, and I
chose to feel trapped. I chose to be sad.

381
00:22:41,711 --> 00:22:43,870
I chose to feel like I was Jack Shit.

382
00:22:43,871 --> 00:22:47,590
I chose all these things and it's like
you don't need fighting to be these

383
00:22:47,591 --> 00:22:48,424
things.
You need to,

384
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,730
you need to let go of fighting to learn
that you are something without it,

385
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,100
and that was actually a gift.

386
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,350
It became a gift because I learned so
much in life now bigger than fighting.

387
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,970
I look at the things that I went through
as a gift because I have gotten the

388
00:23:03,971 --> 00:23:04,930
gift of feeling

389
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,680
retired during my career.
Who else gets that?

390
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:16,600
Some people retire for five years,
lose their freaking mind,

391
00:23:16,601 --> 00:23:19,870
ended up in the bar and come back and
try to fight again 10 years later with a

392
00:23:19,871 --> 00:23:23,920
weakened body. A mess. Why? Why though?

393
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,220
Why are they doing that? They're not doing
it because they're physically capable.

394
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,160
They're doing it because they never
dealt with their life away from fighting.

395
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,520
Fighting was there like fighting is who
they are. Fighting is their persona.

396
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:38,680
So take away fighting. What are they?
They're in the bar drinking away with.

397
00:23:38,681 --> 00:23:41,380
They're not.
Instead of drinking,

398
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,980
putting the booze down and knowing what
you are without fighting, being happy,

399
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:48,020
that chapter of your life and
being able to live who you are.

400
00:23:48,021 --> 00:23:52,400
I've gotten to feel that and now
I can fight with a peace of mind,

401
00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:56,810
knowing how good I am without fighting
and how great I am with it too.

402
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:00,470
And um,
that's,

403
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,890
that's what this thing's about.
All these fights,

404
00:24:03,891 --> 00:24:05,750
all these me attacking those challenges,

405
00:24:05,751 --> 00:24:08,960
coming back and winning and
getting my belt back. Um,

406
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:13,220
that could only happen because I let
go of control of the things I couldn't

407
00:24:13,221 --> 00:24:14,054
control.

408
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,520
[inaudible].
