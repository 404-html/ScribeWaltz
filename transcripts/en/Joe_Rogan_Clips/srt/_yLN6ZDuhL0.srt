1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,200
They separated them. When Damien had one
hook in, he was trying to take us back.

2
00:00:04,201 --> 00:00:08,150
Dude was that fucking homeboy,
the guy who kept saying got it.

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,360
You were seeing people were scared of him,
but he wasn't beating anybody.

4
00:00:11,361 --> 00:00:15,860
That was world class. He wasn't, he wasn't
getting those top 10 guys. Amy, Maya,

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,350
right. Yeah. We got same to Damien.

6
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:22,130
Maia fight will forever be marred by
the fact that they separated them.

7
00:00:22,131 --> 00:00:24,890
When Damien had one hook and
he was trying to take us back,

8
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,630
dude was that fucking homeboy,

9
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,250
the guy who kept [inaudible] him
up with that daughter. Oh my God,

10
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,130
I don't know what he's doing.
Or you didn't see who that was?

11
00:00:34,131 --> 00:00:39,040
Go go to Damien Maia versus um,
Camaros.

12
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:43,400
Huseman and see who, who separated
them. Cause the Ref Matt, uh, Matt,

13
00:00:43,401 --> 00:00:47,420
the Terra Sarah was going fucking
crazy about that. And he's 100% right.

14
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,750
Do you know how difficult it is to get a
hold of a guy like Ooh, spawn like that.

15
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:52,280
And to have one hook in,

16
00:00:52,281 --> 00:00:55,700
standing up and to be working to take
us back and for them to separate him,

17
00:00:55,701 --> 00:00:59,600
it is nonsense. Pure nonsense. How
much harder it is. That's hard. Yeah.

18
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,840
How much harder is to take
Woodley down and control him? Yes.

19
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,890
And then you stand them up. Yup. Yup. If
a moose man, what the fuck are you doing?

20
00:01:06,891 --> 00:01:09,190
Do you mean you stop and think
that you should come down?

21
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,500
You stop and think about Damien Maia
his last fight. Right? Who the fuck?

22
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,070
Who the fuck did he just
choked unconscious fuck out
of? Who was that? Who Was it?

23
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,900
Who did he just choke out someone really
good, um, kid that they fed. Okay.

24
00:01:20,901 --> 00:01:24,650
So here it is. That's not Goddard.
Who is it? Uh, is the bald feller.

25
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,990
Which bald feller? So
here's, um, so here's a,

26
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,200
it's hard to tell who that referee is.
I can't see the face.

27
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,940
So it loose man in them. They're,
they're exchanging ooze. My cracked him.

28
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,070
Who is it? I was it Chris Taione.
I know two referees. I know three.

29
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:45,900
No. Um, it's Leon.

30
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,920
Yeah.
Okay.

31
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,620
Well for whatever reason,
what was God thinking though?

32
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:58,170
I don't know what he was thinking. And
then he's shade online at Jon. Anik.

33
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,400
What'd he say in your commentary was off.
So it was annex.

34
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:06,410
You got my commentary was on. Yeah.
Okay. I don't know what I did to say.

35
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,170
I didn't say anything bad about
Mark Goddard. I said I don't,

36
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,370
I disagree with them standing up.

37
00:02:10,371 --> 00:02:12,020
I don't know why he said
the commentary was off,

38
00:02:12,021 --> 00:02:15,890
but Dominick Cruz did say
that he can't wrestle.

39
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,060
And the reason why he's standing him up
is cause he can't wrestle. Mark honored.

40
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,210
Yes. No, he said though he's, he was
saying that about Mark Goddard. Correct?

41
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:25,610
You've said the referee can't
wrestle. He threw shade. It got her.

42
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,570
I have nothing but respect for God.

43
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,920
Although I don't agree with
his decision in that fight.

44
00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:34,200
I do not agree with standups.
I don't like stand up garden.

45
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:38,150
He's a great referee in that
moment. He's wrong. Well,

46
00:02:38,151 --> 00:02:42,230
he's probably not very emotional.
Listen, your job is not to intervene.

47
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,440
The trajectory of the fight, right?
Your job is to protect the fighters.

48
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,430
No one fuck up. Ooh. Spins. Biggest
fight of his life by standing up.

49
00:02:49,431 --> 00:02:50,990
Because what happens to
this and we've seen it.

50
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,840
Why would it be stood them up and boldly
goes, you know what, fine. I feel good.

51
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:58,910
Knocks him out. Right. You got it.
It can happen. Yeah, it can happen.

52
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,120
What did he say about me?
He didn't specifically call
you off. He didn't call you.

53
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,280
I suppose what he say but, but,

54
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:11,290
but the only thing wildly inconsistent
is your and your cocoms commentators

55
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,810
recollection. Observation of actual
events. I will look Joe Rogan's ass.

56
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,470
That's wrong. So rude. I didn't
see that. I just made that up.

57
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,650
The only thing wildly inconsistent
is your and your cocoms recollection.

58
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,310
Observation of actual events.
I'll save my side for later.

59
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:34,120
Well that doesn't make any sense.
Recollection of actual events.

60
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,300
I don't know what he's trying to say
there and cocoms I didn't say anything bad

61
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:37,931
about them other than that.

62
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:40,140
I don't agree with the standups
and that's not bad job.

63
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,830
But Dominick Cruz said that he can't
wrestle and I don't know if mark odic or

64
00:03:43,831 --> 00:03:47,500
Russell, I know he knows how to
referee compared to Dominick Cruz.

65
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:50,080
He cannot wrestle.
So Dominic's fine to say that.

66
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,810
But also John Annika and harden
the paints. Awesome. Yeah,

67
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:55,270
I like that you are way off.
What's wildly,

68
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,990
wildly inconsistent is correct cause
herb dean is the gold standard in my

69
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:00,490
opinion.
And Herb Dean,

70
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,630
even though he did that thing with
Robbie Lawler is controversial,

71
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,250
kind of look at it and I go, the arm
went limp and see how he made that.

72
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,060
I see that. I could see I, I'm,

73
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,730
I think it's unfortunate and
it may have been a mistake,

74
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:16,410
but it might not have been a mistake.
I, I'm, I'm, I'm still, I'm still,

75
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,060
I'm not at all, not a look man. His job,

76
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:22,240
his fucking way harder than
mine a hundred times harder.

77
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:26,230
Heard Herb Dean's job is to protect the
fighters and to stop fights and to make

78
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:26,980
calls.

79
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,250
I don't want to be that guy that I
thought that guy gets fucking hated on it.

80
00:04:30,251 --> 00:04:33,910
Never loved herb. Never gets low.
And like no one ever gets love,

81
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:37,810
but with more daughter don't be the
guy tried to, John replied, he said,

82
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:40,840
I always try to be respectful.
We just call it like we see it too.

83
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,930
But there's an arrogance with
which you deal with the fighters,

84
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,620
commentators and many in this sport.
And I find it off putting, whoa.

85
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:48,850
One man's take.

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,170
And I'm quite sure you'll give
yours to for everyone to hear.

87
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:57,370
Why not manic stone am Dan.

88
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,720
I'm okay.

89
00:04:58,721 --> 00:05:01,780
So I believe John Eck referred to the
inconsistent between each referees

90
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:05,080
decisions of when to separate the
fighters. And John said exactly.

91
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:09,580
That's what I was referring to,
that that two of the consensus,

92
00:05:09,581 --> 00:05:13,090
Beth best referees of the
game would handle those two
situations so differently.

93
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,330
I understand the athletes are different,
but there are parallels to be drawn.

94
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:19,230
John is 100% correct. Hundred percent a
hundred percent correct. And I'm at us,

95
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,350
Bro. I'm, I'm, I'm,

96
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:24,460
I feel bad that Mark Goddard responded
the way he did because it's not very

97
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:27,610
professional and I think it's very
emotional and I think he's probably just

98
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:31,480
feeling the heat. Yeah.
Yeah. Hard on them. Yeah.

99
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:35,260
You feel that heat and you get angry,
you know. But uh, I liked Mark Goddard,

100
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:38,560
a lack of Milan and I think he's a very
good refereeing top one or two reps in

101
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:41,200
the business. I love mark
daughter. He fucked that up.

102
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,820
My question is I wonder who is telling
them they should stand things up and when

103
00:05:45,821 --> 00:05:46,870
they shouldn't stand things up.

104
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:49,930
I wonder if pressure he for pressure
you feel from the audience you think the

105
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:53,650
crowd maybe it could be that
British people are very nice.

106
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,470
You know sometimes an
English people that man,

107
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,920
when you got to worldclass wrestlers
and this guy is impossible. Take down.

108
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:04,730
He's one of the best of all time. Yup. Let
it go. Let it go. Well I think let it go.

109
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:05,750
Period.
I just,

110
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:09,650
I do not agree with standups cause I think
of a guy can hold you down like this.

111
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,890
What I was saying about Ben
Astron if guy look, Ben asked her,

112
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,950
you can hold you down and give you nuggies
until the fight's over to something

113
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:19,580
about it. Exactly. It's not cheating
if he's not cheating, keep it up.

114
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,020
Do you know how hard is to control
Woodley on the gown and the only outside

115
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,370
fucking minutes you have five
minutes to sink a choke in,

116
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:29,630
five minutes to hold onto him and
beat him up and uh, look, look,

117
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,750
awkward it to this man. He didn't
even fucking care. He gets to buck up,

118
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:35,270
didn't complain where right back at
them and took them down again and again.

119
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:40,340
He's a monster and cool story, Bro. He is
fucking hard to deal with man. For Colby,

120
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,790
for everyone on the planet earth.
But stylistically,

121
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,540
when you look at the fight for Colby,
I look at like Colby does well, yeah,

122
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:50,780
he does that. He does that. The thing
about loose man is he's got power.

123
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,510
He's got striking,
he's got wrestling,

124
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:58,490
but even maybe more
courtly Rto for days here.

125
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:03,290
Oh, it's fine. Mine's a fucking
bank fault. It's Fort Knox.

126
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:09,290
I'm so impressed. How adorable was it?
Him and his little daughter. Oh Dude,

127
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:14,090
I almost cried. Just such a bitch who
I'm such a bitch pussy that I have kids.

128
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:18,410
Me Too. Me Too. I'm like, I know.

129
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:23,320
So cute. And just how happy
mom and wife for real extra,

130
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:28,340
they're like P diddy and a bad video
extra.

131
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,750
Hey man, he, he's so bad the world.

132
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:34,130
Could you imagine what it feels like to
have your husband when the fucking world

133
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,840
world welterweight title to beat Tyron
Woodley? No, I can't block out my wife.

134
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:42,230
Take a hot bath.
The fuck out of here.

135
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:47,470
And my mom sure as fuck wouldn't
be in the case. Hey Man.

136
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,230
I feel like when someone wins like that,
they can do whatever they want. Me.

137
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,300
Carter's mom's always in the cage is dads.
That's true.

138
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,720
Thrown out promo codes.
