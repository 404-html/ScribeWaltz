1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,120
And there's going to be people [inaudible]
the leftist compassion when they

2
00:00:05,251 --> 00:00:08,800
support China and death camps and, and
you know, you're wearing the left's I'll,

3
00:00:08,801 --> 00:00:13,280
oh and passion, right? We can't hurt
anyone's feelings. We're helping arrest,

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,340
fall on gung and sell their organs
that we're Google and stuck to me.

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,080
You're right,
you're right.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,320
The left has giant flaws that has
giant flaws and it's ridiculous ideas.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,700
No, I'm against war. I am too.

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,240
And so now you've seen national
studies show this Gallup poll,

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,260
Democrats now support war
more than Republicans. Well,

10
00:00:35,261 --> 00:00:37,580
this is about what this is about.
Pulling out a series.

11
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,040
I was trying to get denuclearize and
everybody's loving it and South Korea and

12
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,550
Japan and North Korea and he's actually
got him to not fire missiles to destroy,

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,650
declares the real,
the real problem.

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,770
There's a real problem in people not
being able to say that anything that Trump

15
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:53,160
does is good. If a Democrat was doing
what Trump was doing on some issues,

16
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:54,960
I disagree with some.
I would support them.

17
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:58,740
I don't give a damn what their
deer or are well and so and so.

18
00:00:58,741 --> 00:01:02,010
Then Trump got rid of the,

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,310
he's getting rid of the minimum sentences.
I mean Hillary Clinton, you know,

20
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,910
w o God, I saw this the other day. I don't
know, I'm ranting, but I was watching,

21
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,560
I forget to who the top Democrat was.

22
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:14,760
They were on CNN and I'm a political but
my show and I didn't do it. And they,

23
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:18,810
and they go, they go, they go,
president Trump thinks blacks. Yeah.

24
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:23,760
The clip was she an in CNN says
Trump thinks blacks are stupid.

25
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,890
And it was a CNN panel going,

26
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,750
Trump says blacks are super predators
who have to be brought to heel.

27
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,580
And Joe, that's Hillary Clinton in
1994 after she passed the crime act,

28
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,810
that's her quote.

29
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,170
So they are inverting reality knowing
our talking point as she did that and we

30
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:42,720
have the video type in,
Hillary says blacks are super predators.

31
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:47,700
Say said Trump did it. It's not about
Trump, it's that he didn't do that.

32
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,870
Okay. But let's get back to what we
were trying to say was that if you,

33
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:55,350
if he does anything good, no one can
accept it cause he's on the wrong team.

34
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,600
That's part of the problem with,
with what's going on.

35
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,600
It's part of the problem with people
willing to accept ridiculous shit on the

36
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:04,320
left and people willing to
accept ridiculous shit on
the right is that we get on

37
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:06,690
a team and that the people
that are on the left,

38
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:09,000
they can't admit if the
economy is going well,

39
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,400
they can't admit if think they will.
Bill Maher said, let's crush it on me.

40
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,080
Oh I dunno. Uh, you know, I
don't know you like I listen,

41
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:18,630
I've been on his show before
and I talked to him once.

42
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:20,450
We did a show together once with Craig,

43
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,880
nobody can lie and say that
he's not very talented and,

44
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,770
and that he's more his tie. He's more
truthful than most leftist. He says,

45
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:30,150
I want abortion, I want death. [inaudible]
he's a comic of telling you man,

46
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,300
the shit that he's saying. He's only
saying cause he thinks it'll work.

47
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,090
And I don't by the way,
just show with his,

48
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:39,060
but why would he be the highest
ratings ever gotten on? Invite me on?

49
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,130
I don't know man.
You'd have to talk to him.

50
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,790
But what I'm saying is when he starts
talking, like people are saying, Oh,

51
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,190
Bill Maher's mocking the red states.
He's doing a bit,

52
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,220
he's doing a bit like you thought.
There's funny in that. That's all it is.

53
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,340
Like if you, if you've talked to
him about his legitimate opinions,

54
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,610
he's capable of having a conversation
about legitimate opinion of an aggregate,

55
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,010
but you could disagree or
dealers or wrong on that point,

56
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,980
what would you say that the red
states want to be? The blue states,

57
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,470
the demographic show the
opposite, I think. Is this a joke?

58
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,600
A really do I don't think even
means it. I mean, if he does mean,

59
00:03:08,601 --> 00:03:10,480
and I disagree with them by the,
let me show,

60
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,610
let me have a basis to let me
have a beef with you on this.

61
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:15,340
And I'm not saying you're wrong because
everything I've learned is great.

62
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,590
There's a, there's mixtures
of everything. Yes.

63
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,850
And by the time I go to the next
spot, I forget the last thought, but,

64
00:03:20,851 --> 00:03:22,030
but the point is,
is that,

65
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,320
is that what we're saying was that he
was doing a joke about the red states

66
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:29,020
wishing that they were the blue states
and you were saying that that's wrong.

67
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,190
And I was saying he's just fucking around.
He's like product and that's it.

68
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:37,800
That's it. Mainstream news is
getting as very low writing.

69
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,910
She can mean went down to
almost nothing and they go, oh,

70
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:41,980
ratings are up in the Trump era,
like a dead cat bounce.

71
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:43,950
It's like 10% of what
it used to be lurking.

72
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,130
You should have 15 million viewers now
the top scene and show us a million show.

73
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,090
We're looking at that. This is the
future. This is the, this is the,

74
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:54,910
this is where the people are real
things. Not scripted. No teleprompters.

75
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:59,290
There's no teleprompters here. This is
real. And so they get up on television.

76
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,170
I'm literally having Alzheimer's.
What was the point again?

77
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,860
We were talking about Jesus Christ.
One problem. Here's the thing,

78
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,500
here's the problem with no teleprompter.
I am literally,

79
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,330
I literally tell you what's in my brain.

80
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,780
The do just like my truth doesn't mean
I'm accurate. It doesn't mean I'm perfect.

81
00:04:15,781 --> 00:04:17,130
It means I'm telling you
when I really thought,

82
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,800
oh I don't want to fucking around.
I know what it is.

83
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:24,440
No one's watching mainstream news. No
one's watching mainstream news. Sure.

84
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,940
But let me tell you what they
are watching the big five,

85
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,800
the nightly comic shows and comedy
central shows, the daily show, Trevor,

86
00:04:31,801 --> 00:04:35,900
Noah, Stephen Colbert, all those guys,
cause they want some relief but it's,

87
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:39,540
it's not been, they want relief, right.
I used to watch their ratings are down.

88
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:42,090
It's still on a span as you know, as, as,

89
00:04:42,091 --> 00:04:44,760
as other stuff because now
that no one's watching news,

90
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,370
Sean Hannity do really well is in his
show only Fox because it's seen as

91
00:04:50,371 --> 00:04:54,510
alternative. Just like, oh but, but
what I'm saying is well promise,

92
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:58,050
I'm not articulating this well. It's the
truth. It's not like some package thing.

93
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,040
They have turned all of the so called
comic shows into fake comics posing as

94
00:05:04,231 --> 00:05:08,040
fake news. People putting out political
commentary, which people take it as real.

95
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,760
And believe on the street.
And so that's where all the propaganda is.

96
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,980
And so you say, Bill Maher's just joking
around. Bill Maher's just over here.

97
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,340
Bill Maher does what he's doing.
It's all a unified message.

98
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:21,360
They have Stephen Colbert and then lean
upon her and say that I'm a KKK member

99
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,380
and make jokes. And you know what people
shouted at me on the street. Well,

100
00:05:25,381 --> 00:05:29,550
that's unfortunate. Um, but what, what I
will say about what they're trying to do,

101
00:05:29,551 --> 00:05:32,250
they're not trying to deliver information.
They're nuts.

102
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,180
They're trying to crack jokes. I guarantee
you there's a whole writing staff,

103
00:05:36,181 --> 00:05:39,510
kind of all the shows that the Democrats
call them and tell them what to right

104
00:05:39,511 --> 00:05:43,650
now. I don't know if that's true, but
if it is as true and they do listen,

105
00:05:43,651 --> 00:05:45,570
that's not good. And that's
unfortunate. It's like, Oh,

106
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:49,260
you host the man show with Doug. Stan
hope. No, the other guy, uh, nothing.

107
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:50,760
Uh,

108
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,960
there's Jimmy Kimmel and Adam Carolla
says he gets calls every day from Chucky

109
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,920
Schumer and then they, then they work
on what he says he's television show.

110
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,190
This is what's so frustrating. He might've
been fucking around though. No, dude,

111
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:05,450
it's talking points, man.
Okay. I believe you. I believe.
Yeah. When he, I don't know,

112
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,600
lost Jimmy Fallon went from being
funny to being totally weaponized.

113
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,090
So you think it was nbcs idea? Do you
think it was someone in the government?

114
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:21,020
The contacts? NBC says, tell
Jimmy Hours are very well known.

115
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:24,890
UFC fighter that you know. Okay. Who has
shows on discovery and history channel?

116
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,240
I'm not going to say his name.
Okay.

117
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:30,650
And I got a call about a month ago and
they're like, wow, this is incredible.

118
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,530
Don't say my name. You can talk about
it. They were gonna offer me this new,

119
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:35,030
big lucrative show.
But they said,

120
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,360
you're going to come out and announce
Alex Jones on the show or we're not going

121
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:42,080
to give it a show. And he said,
no show. Hell yeah, man. Huh?
