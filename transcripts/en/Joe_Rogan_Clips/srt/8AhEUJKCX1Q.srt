1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,700
Hello Freak bitches. It doesn't get
any better than this for boxing.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,060
Especially like after the Conor Mcgregor,
Floyd Mayweather fight.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,140
This is a fight that like,
hey, this is how it's done.
Yeah, this is the real deal.

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,690
I mean obviously Floyd did it
how it's supposed to be done,

5
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:19,380
but that wasn't two fighters on the
same level. Look at this. This is crazy.

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,310
These were absolutely glorious.
It's fine.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,350
These are both great
moments for boxing though.

8
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:28,350
The Mayweather Mcgregor on this ship
both really, really great for boxing.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,530
Brendan Schaub, I should say this
before the decision gets announced,

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,710
said that if Golovkin didn't win
by some ungodly lopsided beat down,

11
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,840
that he could lose a decision
because of corruption. He goes,

12
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:46,410
cause that's how boxing roles and there's
way more money and Canelo winning.

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,730
So that's sad. Now that we know that
the cop tie sponsor, that's true.

14
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,280
Well apparently the audiences are like
half Mexican. He's a superstar in Mexico.

15
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,670
Just a super sweet talking about Canelo.
Yeah,

16
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,790
so let's see at Brendan Schaub predicted
this correctly because we think it has

17
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:03,870
to be Golovkin the rap,

18
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,490
the unofficial scorecard guy had
it for Golovkin by several rounds.

19
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,910
We think it was go off can clearly,
although canela fought a great fight,

20
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,090
have there been bad decision
if Canelo winds have there?

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,590
What was the last time there was
a decision like that? Tim Bradley,

22
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:23,490
Manny Pacquiao who won that, I
believe Bradley one, but pack,

23
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:27,450
y'all should've won and then came
back and outboxed him. It was worse.

24
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,710
It was worse. If I remember correctly, I
said, what was the reason? Look at that.

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,500
Boom, boom, boom. Oh
Jesus, they're shown hello.

26
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,570
Oh my goodness.

27
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:41,140
This is the last round that was Canelo
just tried to put it to them and go off

28
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:45,830
and he's like, come on, come on,
come on. I'm from Kazakhstan bone.

29
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,110
Just boom over the top.

30
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,380
God Damn just war here.

31
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,200
That had just paid back every
punch he took in the combination.

32
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:59,700
Just sharp jab to his gem.
So snappy. Okay. Change it.

33
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:08,310
Give me a guess. Eddie Bravo
for sure. Glove again, for
sure. Right. Unless there's,

34
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,120
unless there's corruption,
like Brian says, he's not
crazy to say that. I doubt it.

35
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,720
They're cutting scenes, corruption pad.
We're, we're saying this, look at this.

36
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,580
They got it. One 16 one 12 for Golovkin.
Harold led him in here. Harold,

37
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,490
they gave that last.
Lufkin ran away with it.

38
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,260
They gave ten nine on that last fight.

39
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,490
I mean that last round to fucking know
Canelo yeah. You know what I really like?

40
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,840
I don't know why they did that.

41
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,860
I like how these girls just stand there
and smile. They're doing really good job.

42
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,850
They're always smiling. It
seems easy, Dude. It's hard.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,960
You've got to be frozen and fucking
clapping. It drives me crazy. I hate it.

44
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,390
I love it.
I love the f their focus.

45
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,170
They're focused on not being
even remotely normal. This bird,

46
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,030
the job, their focus, their
job is to stand there,

47
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:57,630
smile in Assam psychotic way. If they
were a guy, like if they were a guy,

48
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,140
if you were,

49
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,630
if they hired a guy to stand there in a
nice suit and tie and stand there like

50
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:02,380
this,

51
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,090
could you fucking imagine how crazy
it would be if you hired guys to stand

52
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:10,570
behind fighters with giant smiles
on their face and just not,

53
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,480
especially if they were in their
underwear. Just imagine that.

54
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,890
Imagine guys in a speedo
standing there like ripped,

55
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,910
like holding a [inaudible] sign with
a big giant smile on their face that

56
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:25,660
happens on Santa Monica Boulevard going,
it doesn't happen during a big fight.

57
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,400
Paper view. Eddie Bravo. You
silly goose one day when, hey,

58
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:33,700
let's hear the volume. Let's here
it. Is this a split decision or no

59
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,090
told you son. Oh boy. They fucking boxing.

60
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:52,960
Fucking stinks.
Told you son boxing shot.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,720
Apokyn is a sage.
Brendan.

62
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,120
Brendan Schaub as a safe fucking stinks.

63
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,110
He mad cause he knows.
He knows he got fucked.

64
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,790
You know Canelo well he's going to feel
terrible now. He knows he got his ass.

65
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,620
That's a draw. There's no way.
That's how is that a draw?

66
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,213
Okay.

67
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,290
No, it's, hold on second.
He's actually going to see,

68
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:20,740
if he was happy then that would
mean that he thought he lost.

69
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,250
So the fact that he looks pissed,
that's smart. He's going shoot a one

70
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:30,490
to eight [inaudible] 69 I think
he's mad because he didn't win.

71
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,790
He threw 200 more punches.
Win. But he's definitely mad.

72
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:37,640
Did he got outbox and they made it a
draw to me. I did 50 more punches. Yeah.

73
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:41,290
The fuck is that a draw to me stinks.
It's not even close.

74
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,380
Our punches different. No, there
you go. That's the difference too.

75
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:51,220
Maybe I'll go higher percentage.
Oh, I can't stand it. Yeah,

76
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:55,810
but it's a higher number. Landed two one
14 and one 10 and total power punches.

77
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,780
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, all right. Jab,

78
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:05,110
weird thing though. When you're looking
at it numbers wise, I mean it's one,

79
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,460
it's one way or looking at it,

80
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:11,440
but like one big shot that's a power
punch and then another power punch.

81
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:13,900
It doesn't do anything. They're both
power punches. You know what I'm saying?

82
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,490
Like one shot that really fucks you up
and your legs go and you get wobbly.

83
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,960
That's a power punch and another power
punches his shot that lands in the same

84
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:25,570
spot but doesn't do anything. They're
both powerful. And these colors mean.

85
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:28,450
What are the, what are you what I'm
saying? What is the blue ear? Maine.

86
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,640
I don't know. Look at the number of
punches that, uh, landed on Canelo's face.

87
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:38,320
Hundred nine on his right side and
a 95 on his left to 10 landed two.

88
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:39,670
One 27.
Yeah.

89
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,630
Big Difference in how many landed to
the head getting 40 level and landed way

90
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:46,050
more.
He wait a minute,

91
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,780
said only four shots were
landed to Canelo's body.
That doesn't make any sense.

92
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:53,560
Does that word really when it said, I
see what he says here. Let's hear this.

93
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,340
What happened tonight?

94
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,443
What happened tonight

95
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,370
today?
Really big MACs.

96
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,080
All my friends,
romance,

97
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:17,610
good move. Go right to the
Mexican fans. Fucking smart move

98
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,540
able to neutralize you.
Especially early in the fight

99
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,090
when it looked like you went
starting to build the lead.

100
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,990
I want to,

101
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,430
we probably can't play this without
getting yanked off of a youtube,

102
00:06:32,431 --> 00:06:37,070
so we're going to go to the, first of
all, I didn't think that last fight was a,

103
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:41,490
I mean that last round
was a ten nine Canelo no.

104
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,830
How was he not fucking angry about
this? I mean, why am I angry about it?

105
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,740
Big Drama show tonight.
He retains his belt,

106
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:52,270
so nothing really changes for him and
he gets all that money now that your

107
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,260
record in the rematch is going to be
insane. The rematch will be insane.

108
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,780
Those dollars to 19 good job by
Brendan Man. Fucking good call.

109
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,010
Yeah, box. He filled it.
The fighters were amazing,

110
00:07:05,011 --> 00:07:08,940
but the organization of it just
stinks. Brendan. Nailed it.

111
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,890
Can you hear this? Are you, are you
guys hearing this? What? No. Okay.

112
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,760
What am I hearing what
he thought I wouldn't,

113
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,260
you know,
I don't want to hear.

114
00:07:20,261 --> 00:07:24,180
And here he's not saying I got really
lucky that they gave me that draw.

115
00:07:24,181 --> 00:07:26,880
I don't want to hear what he's saying.
If he thinks he wants to stupid.

116
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:31,380
Still those a great fight. Amazing.
I love it. I don't, you know, I mean,

117
00:07:31,381 --> 00:07:34,140
I do care, but I don't care. I do care.

118
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,820
The thing that I thought the gun go
off getting one, but I don't care.

119
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,920
It's a great fight.
I liked seeing great fights.
