1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,850
Hello Freak bitches. They hate it so
much cause it was humiliating and I,

2
00:00:05,851 --> 00:00:08,190
it got a reaction out of him and I
just kept doing it. It means so much.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,110
It was so much fun. And a lot of times
I, Anthony like at first hated it,

4
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:14,550
but then Anthony started to love it,

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,090
but then opie never loved it and it was
always kind of fun to do because I knew

6
00:00:18,091 --> 00:00:20,010
like deep down it uncle Pauly hates.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,120
So I would always don't go Paul just
to fucking make them sick because he

8
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:25,860
couldn't get with uncle
Paul Anthony of course.

9
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:30,780
Could you more comfortable now doing it
without him? The radio show much much.

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,470
Yo. Yeah, we stopped liking each other.
I mean the reality is we are, you know,

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,470
I know and I really mean that.
I always think I bad in his real life.

12
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:40,020
Like I don't want bad it
to happen to him, but, uh,

13
00:00:40,021 --> 00:00:43,370
we simply stopped liking
each other. So, um, but he,

14
00:00:43,371 --> 00:00:48,120
he was enjoying his afternoon show much
more without me. Then he was with me. Um,

15
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,120
I got the morning spa, spa
for whatever, you know. Um,

16
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,210
I think the company just was annoyed at
him or whatever they like to be in. Sam,

17
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:58,300
we're hungry, but his afternoon show
was good. I mean, uh, you know, he,

18
00:00:58,301 --> 00:01:01,440
him and Shirod and those guys, they were
having fun so people didn't like it.

19
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:01,981
They didn't like it,

20
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:05,700
but he sounded like he was having fun and
he was loose on him. Fired. Like what,

21
00:01:05,701 --> 00:01:09,180
what happened? What the
technical reason was, was um,

22
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,710
he had filmed Roland Campos,
our booker taking a shit.

23
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,730
Um, now I know, oop, well he
filled me doing it in 2009,

24
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,700
but he was being a goofball. You, I don't
think he was trying to be degrading,

25
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,150
just being an ass.
And then I'm showing it to,

26
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:27,630
I think a couple of the comics
and I guess, I don't know exactly,

27
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,720
I heard about it after the
ball had already been rolling.

28
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,580
So somehow Roland got nervous that he was
going to release it and maybe opie was

29
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:37,440
tea. I don't know what Robbie
said to him. I really don't.

30
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,700
But I think that it got back to one of
Rollins bosses and then the head of the

31
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:45,240
talent department spoke to them. And
then once human resources got involved,

32
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,160
then things change.

33
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,700
And I remember there was a clip of it
was getting bad and there was another

34
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:57,930
producer in the studio named Paul and
he was videotaping it and I think he had

35
00:01:57,931 --> 00:02:01,920
been unrolling side and he thought
he was being a dick to him.

36
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,210
He's going to be a dick to
me. Nobody's like, yeah,

37
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:04,980
cause you chose Roland
in this whole thing,

38
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,330
like making it a public thing that was
really uncomfortable. And then Paul goes,

39
00:02:09,331 --> 00:02:12,450
yeah, well I thought it was
wrong. And then Shirod goes
like, ah, he was having fun.

40
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,110
We all saw the tape, he was enjoying it.
He was laughing. And when I heard that,

41
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,070
I'm like, oh no, he just
said we all saw the tape.

42
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,190
So all the time like that just made it,
and again,

43
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,140
maybe they were going to fire him anyway.
I don't know.

44
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,960
Like they don't tell me that shit.
Um,

45
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,030
but he thinks that the
company was out to get him.

46
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,290
I don't know and again, I kind of
know what they said to him privately,

47
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,980
but to me he had two months left on his
deal and no company wants to fire you

48
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:44,210
two months out because of, because
of the potential lawsuits, lawsuits,

49
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,190
they would much rather let you ride
it out and then just not resign.

50
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:50,880
You will serious is in a weird
place because of podcasts. Yes.

51
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:54,810
I mean it's just in a very weird place
that the idea of paying money for these

52
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:58,770
talk shows that are going to get
interrupted by commercials and to have to

53
00:02:58,771 --> 00:03:01,540
listen them only when they come
on and not have them on demand.

54
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,560
It's such an inferior distribution
where the online demand, like now,

55
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,440
now they're on demand is on your phone
an hour after it's up yet or an hour

56
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:12,890
after it's but live. You can listen
live on the phone and get it. Yeah.

57
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,420
What I'm saying is on your radio,
like if you're in your car and you,

58
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,310
you can't just pick,

59
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,870
I want to listen to Tuesdays opie and
Anthony Show or Jim Norton and Sam show.

60
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,760
I can't just pick that. I don't know if
you can, unless you have a phone hooked,

61
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:30,130
it might be a way to do with that phone
hooked up. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Right.

62
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:31,390
But I don't think you could do that.

63
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:34,960
Like Sirius radio was only
playing what's playing right now.

64
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,340
I think so far I don't have car.

65
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:44,290
I mean I don't have a thing where
I could just pick an episode.

66
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:48,400
How has a podcast plate in a car you just
get, there's a bunch of different ways.

67
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,630
One, you can do it where you could
stream it live through youtube.

68
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,200
Some people do that and you just play
the audio and if you have it set up,

69
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,400
you can play the video. Some people do
it where you, uh, you're on stitcher.

70
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:04,030
Stitcher is a low bit rate version,
meaning it's a,

71
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:06,430
the audio quality's not as
good because it's compressed,

72
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,380
but it's way quicker to download.

73
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:13,060
So if you have some sort of a plan where
you want to get a less data per month,

74
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,870
a lot of people use stitcher or
they just get it off of iTunes.

75
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:20,860
But the thing about it is that you just,
if you have your phone Bluetooth up,

76
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:21,461
you literally,

77
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,820
all you have to do is press play and
it'll immediately play like whatever

78
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:28,480
episode. Like you want to scroll
through, scroll through our stuff.

79
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,050
I think if you go to work for Siri
now too on the new operating system,

80
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,210
just like ask for it. Yeah. You could
play it for Siri, but if you go through,

81
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,100
have you ever done, do you use it?
Do you use a iTunes or a podcast APP?

82
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:46,180
I never look at podcast
standing. All My, like my most,

83
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,780
the recent ones of all the ones that I
subscribe to and I can just take one,

84
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:54,160
click it and boom, now it's
playing. I mean that's just,

85
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,040
it's done differently on Sirius.
Yeah, the APP you have to use.

86
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,840
The on demand is pretty good,
but it's,

87
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,080
I think it's an hour after it as
you can get it forever. I feel good.

88
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,910
I don't listen. I don't really
listen to the shell. I mean,

89
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:07,840
I never listened to our show. Um, I
listened to it on drives and like, wow.

90
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:11,650
I kinda like it. Um, it's, it's new. We
find the Anthony back in the building,

91
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,860
I was allowed to come on as a
guest in our, in the building.

92
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,890
I fought for three years for that.
And literally right after he got fired,

93
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:20,830
they let him Anthony back in after,
I hope you got fired. He kept them.

94
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,370
I don't know. It could be
really honest. I don't know. Um,

95
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,860
I don't think that he actively kept him
out. No. Do they know the real numbers?

96
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:29,680
Like did they ever tell you how many
people were actually listening? Never.

97
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:32,860
I don't know if they know. I mean, I
don't know how they would track that.

98
00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:35,410
They may,
but they don't and apply to me.

99
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:37,720
It's like I really want to know because
it will give us negotiating power.

100
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,700
I'd apply to me. He's like,
I really don't want to know,

101
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,470
but the fact that we're getting raises,
I think we're doing okay. Like I,

102
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,310
that's the only way I can tell is
that they, I know that they want to,

103
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,690
to keep me every time the contract is
okay. We must be doing okay. Um, but no,

104
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:50,880
I don't know what the numbers are.

105
00:05:50,881 --> 00:05:54,900
Just it's amazing how quickly it became
a different thing. You know, like,

106
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,770
like I remember when Howard went
to serious, it was like, wow,

107
00:05:57,771 --> 00:06:01,770
how Luhya finally we're going
to get uncensored radio.

108
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,140
And then it became,

109
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:07,400
well it's still just radio and still
it's still alive and now you have to pay

110
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:11,330
for it. Now it's 10 bucks a month
and mean he made out like a bandit.

111
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:16,310
I mean he made ridiculous sums of money
from it, but where's the future in that?

112
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:20,090
It just seems like that's a in, but
see it's like almost like investing in,

113
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,180
I mean if you're, if you're
someone who's got a piece of that,

114
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:25,700
it's like where's that going?
Like how are you going to keep,

115
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,760
you can't even use it in a tunnel.
You know, the thing we've series,

116
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:32,050
and this is this like a scary for
job security, but they really,

117
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,000
Scott is good at getting big name talent,

118
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,150
like a Beatles channel and all this
stuff and they're good at getting good,

119
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,320
good name, a big name, people doing
shows like Ferguson's on there.

120
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,430
And our channel. Yeah. I not a faction.
Um, where you guys are all in faction now.

121
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,510
Faction talk.
Yeah.

122
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:50,330
I hate the name cause it doesn't say
comedy but whatever it is what it is,

123
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,260
it's awesome. And then can we know
and rich and then Ellis and then uh,

124
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,530
Craig and then Nick Depalo who was
a very funny show. He's hilarious.

125
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:00,770
Nick is a fucking savagely funny guy.
I love that guy.

126
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,210
He's just a fucking raw fucking bark
out a joke. Funny Guy like nick is.

127
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,530
Here's the thing about nick,
he's never afraid to try to be funny.

128
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,410
Like I've done a lot of projects with
them. We get tough crowd for two years.

129
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:14,240
I've just done a shitload
of stuff back, back, back,

130
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:16,610
back like Nicholas fucking fire lines out.

131
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,670
And I've always admired him for
that because sometimes they work,

132
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:20,504
sometimes they don't,

133
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:25,220
but he's on a freight is a funny fucking
dude and he's unafraid to bark stuff

134
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:28,660
out and be who he is. Like I love
that. And he does a great show. Um,

135
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,390
he's a really surprisingly
good radio guy like,

136
00:07:30,391 --> 00:07:32,540
but go into breaks and all that stuff.
But yeah,

137
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,930
Anthony's doing it for a long time
with Rd, remember? That's right. Yes.

138
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:36,920
I was on the charity show,

139
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:41,030
but I remember watching the one blow out
that they had or nick was trying to do

140
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:44,750
some read that they had already did.
Just wanted to kind of fuck off.

141
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,690
You can't let it get to you like that.
We've had the blowouts.

142
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,490
I've been through them. I've seen them,
me and that never had one. Um, I love man,

143
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,950
one of my fucking, I just wrote the
foreword to his book. I don't know.

144
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:57,950
I'm supposed to say that, but too bad.
I'm proud of it. I fucking love him.

145
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,680
And he's doing a show with
already now. Right? The AIA show

146
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,010
fucking greatest name.
They had a great billboard for it and a,

147
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:10,430
it's really funny man. It's really scrub
to listen to that. You do it for the,

148
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:12,980
to the compound. Yeah. How much does
that cost? I honestly don't know.

149
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,490
I do pay for it though. He offered
me a free one, but I'm looking at it.

150
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:19,110
I'll chime in. I mean I'll fucking,
I'll chip in and it's doing well. Frame.

151
00:08:19,111 --> 00:08:21,620
That whole compound. Yeah.
He hasn't skipped a beat.

152
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:23,000
His life is fucking doing great.
Yeah.

153
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:26,630
There's not a great thing that both
their mugshots real legit mugshots

154
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,800
hilarious. They did it.
Yeah. Compound media.

155
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,640
I like how he called it compound media
too because, oh, look at the AIA show.

156
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:37,580
Great Posture Timber Fifth now
can you get that on your phone?

157
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,330
You can get it on an APP. I have the
Anthony coming into it in the car.

158
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,870
You can listen to it in the car. He's
a, but yeah, he's he, I love him too.

159
00:08:44,871 --> 00:08:46,070
He's one of my favorite people ever.

160
00:08:46,071 --> 00:08:49,550
He's literally somebody who I don't
think I'll ever not be close to.

161
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,370
There's no one created like I love Sam.
I love all these guys I've worked with,

162
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:53,810
but Anthony,
there was a weird,

163
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,810
it's a comic thing that happens when
you're going back and forth with some of

164
00:08:57,811 --> 00:09:00,370
this in energy you're
exchanging and with him. Dude,

165
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,330
there are Jim Norton laugh compilations.
I never listen to my own shit.

166
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:05,220
I don't listen to the old show.
I can't listen to it,

167
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,180
but those I can listen to because they're
all in. Anthony just making me laugh.

168
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,350
It's not me saying funny shit.

169
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,670
It's Anthony saying funny shit
that every time fucking gets me.

170
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:17,700
Like he would literally make me laugh
like that wheeze laugh that an audience

171
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:21,730
member gets. I'm like, I never get to
fucking feel that way, but he's not even,

172
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,480
what's crazy is he's not a stand up.
He's not a standup.

173
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,270
He's done it a little bit,
but in that rolling. Yeah,

174
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:30,790
he tried it a couple of [inaudible] like
in Montreal a couple of years ago and

175
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,870
just do it. Yeah. After you'd been
fired. Oh my God. Yeah. No, no.

176
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:34,790
This would all be an Anthony.

177
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:38,520
We're supposed to do a show together
to host a comedy show in Montreal.

178
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:41,250
I was part of the show,
but I'll be at home for some reason.

179
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:42,600
He flew home a day early.
He didn't want to do it,

180
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,480
so aunties did it by himself and host
of the show and started shitting on the

181
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:49,740
comedians and he was really funny. First
time ever on stage. He was fucking funny.

182
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,850
But in a, in a comic room. Patrice
said that about him. He said,

183
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
he said Anthony can access funny faster
than any person I've ever seen and

184
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,620
Patrice didn't hand out.
You was not the known as the big Ole boy,

185
00:10:01,621 --> 00:10:05,100
that Guy Dolan out compliments. Again,
like that was not, Patrice has reputation,

186
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,380
but Anthony has that ability to reach
in and grab funny from anywhere and he's

187
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:12,770
as fast as any comic we've ever had on it.

188
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,450
There's never been a comedian in
there who was faster than him.

189
00:10:15,451 --> 00:10:18,300
They'd been as fast as him guys
like Patrice or burro genius,

190
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,940
but there's no one's ever been able
to go in there and run circles around

191
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:24,480
Anthony. Right. It's staggering how
fucking funny that guy. Yeah, it is weird.

192
00:10:24,481 --> 00:10:26,580
It's like he's a comic
who never became a comic,

193
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,540
but that's how I've always felt about
being around them and even dice said that

194
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,420
about him and dice was shitting on opiate
Anthony when they had a few together.

195
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,500
He was saying that that Anthony's
actually talented and he's actually almost

196
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:40,230
like a comic, but he never
did it. He never did it.

197
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,580
And Anthony has an ability brewers
and amazing story teller to an amazing

198
00:10:44,581 --> 00:10:48,240
storyteller. Whereas aunt could do that
about like, he could literally tell you,

199
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:50,940
he would talk about like,
you don't be in a tin knocker and stuff.

200
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,310
I have no knowledge of or interest in and,

201
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,340
and he would have me on the edge of my
seat listening to him talk about it.

202
00:10:56,341 --> 00:11:00,300
He just has a gift for explaining
things and for walking you through it.

203
00:11:00,301 --> 00:11:04,170
Louie has that the ability to explain
an amazingly interesting fashion and

204
00:11:04,171 --> 00:11:08,090
Anthony can just jump in and out of
voices and do impressions. And I mean, I,

205
00:11:08,091 --> 00:11:11,670
I never get sick of rambling about him
cause I got to work with them for a

206
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:11,671
fucking decade.

207
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,460
I got to work with the funniest guy
in the fucking world for a decade.

208
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:18,240
Like as much as it sucks that it's over,
like I'm grateful.

209
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,040
I just want to do it again.

210
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,560
100% of you thought about doing that and
I would love to do it with him and Sam,

211
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,820
I mean me and I'll be,
don't get along anymore. Um,

212
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,270
but I would love to have Anthony
with me and Sam. But again,

213
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:31,060
he's got his own show. It's not
going to happen, but I love salmon.

214
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,420
I have a very good chemistry
and a comfort level. Like I,

215
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:37,100
I like him and I trusted him on the
air and with LP it just got bad.

216
00:11:37,101 --> 00:11:39,390
I'm not blaming him. It's like,
Hey, I was half the problem too.

217
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,630
But what about you doing a show
with Anthony? Compound media?

218
00:11:42,631 --> 00:11:46,370
Shell compound media is to get it to a
more enclosed environment than Sirius's

219
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,320
and because of gigs and other things
I got to promote. I just Kinda,

220
00:11:49,321 --> 00:11:52,740
I wanted to stay and also series pays
more and I didn't want to negotiate

221
00:11:52,741 --> 00:11:54,460
against Anthony. I just
couldn't. I was like, Eh,

222
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,760
I wasn't going to use him as a
negotiation tactic. I didn't want to do,

223
00:11:57,761 --> 00:11:59,090
I couldn't do it. Um, he's,

224
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,620
I'm too close to him and I always kind
of secretly wanted them to come back.

225
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,350
And when he came back the
first day he came back. I mean,

226
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:11,240
it was a messy in that fucking, I got the,
we went to a Springsteen. No. Who Played,

227
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,890
oh, guns and roses played at
the fucking, uh, the Apollo.

228
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,990
So this was like right
after you get fired.

229
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:19,570
So I saw Scott Greenstein that night
or Andrew and they're like, yeah,

230
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:21,670
he can come in. Anthony came in, I'm
like, really? They're like, yeah,

231
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:24,160
you can come in. And I'm like, great.
I texted him, come in tomorrow,

232
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,120
the minute he could come in and a,
but security hadn't been told.

233
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,590
So I'm on the show and we,
I know ants coming in.

234
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,440
It's gonna be a fucking
surprise for the audience,

235
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,140
but he's being held up at
security because in fairness,

236
00:12:35,141 --> 00:12:38,980
they needed an email from
Scott. They didn't know that
had been okayed. Right. Had,

237
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,160
it took about an hour or 40 minutes, but
he got up and seeing him walk down that,

238
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:45,910
aw, fuck, it was so good. We'll
get them there. Yeah, he was happy.

239
00:12:45,911 --> 00:12:49,870
You very rarely see that on his
face. It was so good. But, but you,

240
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,160
you just go right back into that.
And Sam is so perfect in that moment too.

241
00:12:54,161 --> 00:12:57,540
Or you just kind of go back into
it and you flow and, you know,

242
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,080
so I miss him a lot,
but

243
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:08,980
okay.
