1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,370
And I'm 100% confident. I did
nothing wrong. Right. From a huge,

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,430
as a human being or a comic,
you know,

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:11,650
like maybe reading the room would have
been a thing I did, but I was like,

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,280
I was like, I know these people. These
are my fucking brethren. Like I, yeah,

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,610
I got fucking took calculus with you
people. You're like, yeah, I know.

6
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:23,020
I know the kind of Shit that me and my
Asian friends and my Indian friends would

7
00:00:23,021 --> 00:00:27,280
talk when we were in fucking school like
this. This is fucking light work. Right.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,360
Right. And so, so maybe that, but
even then I'm like, no, fuck that.

9
00:00:31,361 --> 00:00:36,010
I'm not going to fucking think about
that going awry. You know what I mean?

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,850
But yeah, it was, it was
crazy. Yeah. Well it's,

11
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,950
it's an educational experience and
net positive overall without a doubt.

12
00:00:44,951 --> 00:00:47,650
And it also gives us an opportunity
to make fun of these kids,

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,240
which I think they need.

14
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,860
They need to realize that the world
thinks they're fools. Yeah. And I,

15
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,590
and I really believe that all,
I've read several articles on your case,

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,720
your situation rather your case
caught a case. I got comedy me today.

17
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,583
You know,

18
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,920
all the articles that I've read
were all essentially positive.

19
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,160
Yeah. And they were all, you know,
mocking these fucking little children.

20
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,150
I want to say for the record
that I was on the record,

21
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,140
I still think that it was at
the still think that though.

22
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:23,530
It's like the minority of that group,
especially at Columbia for sure. Sure.

23
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,820
You know,
like it's just that they happen to like,

24
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,050
cause the majority of those kids were
like amped and like had a good time.

25
00:01:29,051 --> 00:01:31,180
And even if that can happen though word,

26
00:01:31,181 --> 00:01:35,250
some majority a majority can like you
in a minority can stand up and then the

27
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:37,380
majority doesn't do anything
about it. You just go, wow,

28
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,520
that shit hurt my feelings.
No, no, no. Those kids,

29
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,090
those kids saying like let them stay, let
them stay. But it wasn't like a chorus,

30
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,890
which is what I would
have hoped. But um, yeah,

31
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,150
they're a little fucking babies and they
need to hear it. They need to hit it.

32
00:01:51,151 --> 00:01:53,820
The little babies, cause that's
how you grow up. You know, you,

33
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,000
you'd do something ridiculous and then
people criticize you and then you realize,

34
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,480
oh, I'm kind of ridiculous.
Yeah, let me just check myself.

35
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:02,790
Then it hurts your feelings and
you fight it off for a little bit.

36
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,260
You try to pretend you battle it,

37
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:09,410
but overall over the course of time you're
going to absorb that information and

38
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:13,240
hopefully those kids are going
to grow and mature. Yeah.

39
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,240
I mean I have friends that were
like completely progressive, Weirdo,

40
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,390
crazy off the charts like activists
10 years ago and now they're like way,

41
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,530
way mellow and they've just like,
what was wrong with me?

42
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,730
I was virtue signaling I was trying too
hard and they realize like the lot of

43
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:35,030
what they were doing was just
wasting energy and it was just,

44
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,800
it just a lot of adjuncts
in a lot of just trying to,

45
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:42,650
trying to affect change in order to
make themselves feel better. Yeah.

46
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,530
You know what I mean?

47
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,640
Trying to push buttons in order
to validate their existence.

48
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,743
That's what a lot of that,

49
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,650
that that specific instant felt like
it was like it was either like a, nope,

50
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,460
we have an opportunity to
assert our sort of rightness,

51
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,770
however wrong it is here and be like,
this is,

52
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:02,530
we're going to take a stand and
yeah, this is who we are. I'm like,

53
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,810
y'all just just chill. Yo, chill
the fuck out. What the fuck?

54
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,150
Yeah. It's, there's a lot of foolishness,

55
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,240
but this is the world we live in and
I think there's a big part of that

56
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,530
accentuated by the fact that we have
a maniac for president. Yo. Yeah.

57
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,710
That's what it is.

58
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:22,000
Because they feel like that eval needs
to be combated at every turn because we

59
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:25,750
didn't before and we let this guy
get into office and now here he is,

60
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:29,380
and the Mueller probe and
all this fucking craziness.

61
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,040
When Obama was president, it
shit felt a lot cooler. Yeah.

62
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:37,990
I mean now it's like Trump is present.
Everyone was like, Oh shit man,

63
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:39,280
bunker down.
What'd you know?

64
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:41,830
We realize all you have to do is be
popular and you can be president.

65
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,090
Like that's insane. Yeah. I used
to be, you had to be qualified.

66
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,990
We used to think that you understood
national policy, foreign policy,

67
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:54,460
you understood defense. You understood
exactly what's going on with the economy.

68
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:57,040
Basic English. Yeah. Yeah.
That guy doesn't know shit.

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,440
He's just trying to make money. And
wouldn't you love to be a fly on the wall?

70
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,270
I would.
Cause what we're getting,

71
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:07,450
all the crazy is him when he knows
cameras are on them. Oh yeah.

72
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:11,250
I would love to see what he's like alone.
Like what is,

73
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,320
I would love to see him
like watch Fox News.

74
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,880
I like to like sit in our cheeseburger.
Just fucking cry. He's a crazy person.

75
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,770
It's really weird, man. It's
unnerving. And that's what I think.

76
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:26,590
Like what a lot of what we're seeing on,

77
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,090
especially with this particular thing
is the thing where it's like you don't

78
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:34,030
have control in any other
facet of your life necessarily.

79
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:38,080
So you're going to try to exert it
in a way that you think is positive,

80
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:41,620
when in fact you're doing the
opposite of what you, you're,

81
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,350
you're liberal sensibilities are.
Yeah.

82
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,190
I think it's also a trend and I think,
um,

83
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,440
that political correctness and
it comes in waves and it existed.

84
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,750
It was pretty, pretty
strong in the 80s, you know,

85
00:04:55,751 --> 00:05:00,190
like political correctness was a washing
over people in the 80s and destroy rap

86
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:03,160
and shit and it's coming
back and it'll go away again.

87
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:06,490
People get sick of it and it'd be
ridiculous and people will rebel against

88
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,790
political correctness center it.

89
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,820
But I think overall the
culture is trying to adjust.

90
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:17,830
It's trying to self adjust. We're
trying to, the, the actual culture,

91
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,120
the as a whole is trying to eliminate
racism and eliminate sexism and eliminate

92
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:26,490
bias, which are good noble
goals there. Good number goals,
right? But along the way,

93
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:29,950
as you have these polar extremes
of people that are doing it wrong,

94
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,880
poor execution, terrible execution
and everyone understanding,

95
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,410
and it's also strange to me,

96
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:40,411
it's like what utopia are you
trying to create by silencing stuff?

97
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,730
Because just because you do
that, just because you say, oh,

98
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:46,840
you can't say racist shit
doesn't mean it goes away.

99
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,860
Or you can't say sexy
shit doesn't mean it's a,

100
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,710
that's more like you're treating the
symptom and not the disease. Right.

101
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:56,860
But in their defense does talking
about very specific platform, right.

102
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,010
This is a stage.

103
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,060
If you had actually said
something actually racist
then it would make sense that

104
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:05,410
hey, we don't want anybody telling
racist you 100% right. Yeah.

105
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,530
So they but they wanted it to be
racist. Yeah. That's the thing.

106
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:11,630
It's like Yo just fucking take a minute,

107
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,370
take a second to relax and once I get it,

108
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:20,000
is that what utopia have you
read about that's ever been real?

109
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,480
Like every book we read in high
school, College, brave new world,

110
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:28,010
Lord of the flies [inaudible] or animal
farm like the giver we read in fucking

111
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:30,500
Middle School,
that's all a utopia.

112
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,210
But this fuck fucking killing
babies and you know south all of it.

113
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,150
It's all a fucking false utopia
kind of situation. There's,

114
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,940
there is hate speech in the
world on a percent. You know,

115
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,550
you don't want it on your platform, but
you've got to decide what is hate speech,

116
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,150
when is it really hate speech?
And when is it just ignorance.

117
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:52,420
And sometimes the best way to combat bad
speech is to let that speech play out

118
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:57,110
and let good speech overwhelm it with
logic and reason and a better argument.

119
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,920
That's, that's really what freedom of
speech is supposed to be all about.

120
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,210
That we work all this out.

121
00:07:02,211 --> 00:07:06,260
As soon as you start censoring voices
and telling people that you're not going

122
00:07:06,261 --> 00:07:09,590
to allow them to talk,
boy, you, you, you start,

123
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:14,470
you create this atmosphere where you
can start to choose what you're going to

124
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:16,220
allow through and when you're
not going to allow through,

125
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:19,460
and then you're gonna start censoring
things that are far more subtle.

126
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,720
You're going to start censoring
things that, you know,
they don't seem reasonable,

127
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,810
but you've decided that
it's already okay to sensor.

128
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,650
So you've censored this person nagging
a sense of the next worst thing, right?

129
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,560
And you're going to go down the line
until it's just people that disagree with

130
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:33,740
you.
