1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,530
Beat up, this is gotta be taking up
a tremendous amount of your time.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,150
Like what if, are you doing anything
else in addition to doing this?

3
00:00:09,151 --> 00:00:11,880
Are you setting aside everything else
in your life other than your family

4
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:14,980
obligations? I have
two jobs, man. One, uh,

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,230
help accelerate society to try and deal
with this historic transition, Maryanne,

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,330
and to stay married. Those only
things I'm about. Wow, that's a,

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,300
that's a powerful path. Um, now when,

8
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:30,300
when you're looking at the opposition
and you look in all the other people that

9
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:32,940
are running for president
and wonder whether or not
they're going to be there by

10
00:00:32,941 --> 00:00:36,560
the time the elections roll around,
would it, what are you saying that's,

11
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,270
it's really interesting, Joe. Holy Cow.

12
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,540
That one of the funnest things about
running for president is you run into all

13
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:46,170
the other candidates on the trail in Iowa,
in New Hampshire.

14
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,530
So I'm like just hanging out
backstage with like the gang.

15
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,910
It's so interesting and fun.
It is weird sometimes,

16
00:00:53,911 --> 00:00:57,210
but I really liked most of them. And
so sometimes people ask me like, Hey,

17
00:00:57,211 --> 00:00:59,040
who do you want your running mate to be?
And I'm just like,

18
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:03,060
it really depends upon who I just click
with best because we're just going to be

19
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:06,570
on the trail all the time together.
So having met a bunch of them,

20
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:11,280
I got to say most of the candidates are
really genuine patriots who just want to

21
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:12,610
try and do something positively.

22
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,230
See the country's heading
in the wrong direction.

23
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,170
I could work with most all of them,
uh,

24
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,570
in terms of who I think is going
to be there in the end. Man,

25
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:22,830
it's really interesting. Uh,
I mean, one reason I like,

26
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,640
I will say that apparently the mainstream
press had it out for Bernie last time

27
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:27,690
where they were just going to,
like,

28
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,780
I have a friend who worked in the media
and they were like, just like, you know,

29
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:35,280
kneecap Bernie. Why was he
going the kneecap brain? Um,

30
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:39,360
well it's like there's definitely
something going on where like certain

31
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:42,810
corporate media companies
have certain candidates,

32
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:46,030
they kind of want to tip the scales for
a little brown and people that they want

33
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:47,190
to like tip it against.
Well,

34
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:49,530
they thought that Bernie was going
to get in the way of Hillary winning.

35
00:01:49,531 --> 00:01:51,600
Is that the idea? Yeah.
Yeah. I mean they, they,

36
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:55,530
they were in the Hillary camp for sure.
Yeah. And so that wasn't just the media,

37
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:57,930
that was also the DNC,
which is now on the record.

38
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,720
So now happily,

39
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:04,260
certainly the DNC has turned a totally
different leaf where the DNC is like,

40
00:02:04,261 --> 00:02:06,330
we're not going to do anything that like,

41
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,290
and your peers with Eddie Woods prospects.
Well, what they did was a disaster.

42
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,650
A disaster in terms of
public image too. Yeah. Yeah.

43
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:17,130
It was both substantively and like
perception wise, the disaster for them.

44
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,150
So this time I got to say, and that the
team is turned over almost entirely,

45
00:02:21,151 --> 00:02:25,040
like it's almost totally different
people. And then the media, I,

46
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,300
we have the sense that, you know, they're,

47
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:31,110
they're still feeling out who they're
going to try and put the thumb on the

48
00:02:31,111 --> 00:02:35,220
scale for. Uh, so Ernie, Bernie
is still running though, right?

49
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,490
It looks like he's running it. You want
to know something that's really stupid,

50
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,690
but it changed my opinion of him.

51
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,500
He was being grilled by some of them
at the airport with a camera and he was

52
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:44,850
pretending to talk on the phone,

53
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,140
but you could tell he wasn't really on
the phone white and I saw that and I was

54
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:52,800
like, oh, you can't do that. You
can't do that. You could say,

55
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:57,210
I'm not giving impromptu interviews.
Thank you very much. And keep walking.

56
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,180
Like if you want to interview me,
do it through the correct channels.

57
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,000
But he didn't do that.
He pretended to be on the phone.

58
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,290
It's a weird thing because if you're
willing to do that, like that's just,

59
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,880
this is deceptive. Especially if
you can actually see the deception,

60
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:16,840
which clearly you can see the video
of the fucking phone is not on.

61
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,930
It's like he's,
it's like you could see his text messages

62
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,850
and he's like, and the guy saying
to him, you're not on the phone.

63
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:28,000
I can tell you're not on the phone.
And he keeps walking. It's like,

64
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,560
I know that's a stupid thing,
but it's like, Huh. We all,

65
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,250
we all saw out details about different
people in different areas, you know,

66
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,160
and like, you know,
it's like, I think, uh,

67
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,950
one reason I'm so grateful for this
opportunity as I was like, you know,

68
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,700
like you actually can get a sense of
different people in different environments

69
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:48,730
and it does end up impacting
your, your perception. So I mean,

70
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:52,180
people made decisions on much
lesser data points in that,

71
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,730
that way. I'll remember what the fuck's
his name from Vermont who uh, Howard Dean.

72
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,790
The Dean scream man, the freaking
[inaudible] he's from where he was from.

73
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:04,180
Vermont. Vermont. Yeah. That
scream killed him. Sank him.

74
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,890
Do you remember the Chappelle show parody?

75
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:08,380
The Chappelle show party of
that was hysterical. It's funny,

76
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,860
but the fact that that it was
just because it was a loud, like,

77
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,400
as a person who works in
front of audiences a lot,

78
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,690
when you're yelling into a
microphone, like the, the,

79
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,620
you hear like, especially if you
don't have monitors in front of you,

80
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,790
what you hear is like everything.
You hear the crowd screaming,

81
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,640
you hear everything. And if you're
yelling into that microphone,

82
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:34,980
you're not realizing what it sounds
like as a recording with him is like,

83
00:04:34,981 --> 00:04:38,890
yeah. And that was it. One scream,

84
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,120
I imagine,

85
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:45,390
imagine that one scream literally
changed the course of that man's life.

86
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,170
One and most of that might've changed
the course of the nation's history.

87
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,740
Might've crazy.
I don't know if that would happen today.

88
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:55,720
I think especially post Trump,

89
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:59,710
one thing that has happened is we're
willing to forgive so much more,

90
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,380
you know, in some ways. Yeah.
In some ways. No, man. I
mean, I feel like, you know,

91
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:07,860
like some, some people, uh, uh,

92
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,620
more forgiving than others for different
things and for sure there's certainly,

93
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,390
yeah, it varies. But it would be
interesting to imagine what a,

94
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,550
what the dean scream
would result in today.

95
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:23,440
Hopefully I'm not the person that tests
it out. Scream, please don't scream.
