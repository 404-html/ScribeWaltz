1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:00,601
I'm ridiculous.

2
00:00:00,601 --> 00:00:03,930
How frustrating was it for you going
into that Tony Ferguson fight with that

3
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:06,490
staph infection? Because
that was a, that was serious.

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:07,980
I didn't notice it at the weigh ins,

5
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,970
but then the moment you walked
into the cage, it was funny man,

6
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:15,330
because they were telling DC don't talk
about it cause I was going that staff

7
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:19,250
that, that is fucking staff. And then they
said to DC, don't talk about it. He goes,

8
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,250
Yup, that looks like staff to me. He
just ignored him. He's like, fuck you.

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,023
That's staff.

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,290
I don't know why they didn't want
anybody breaking it up because it's an

11
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:29,060
important point.

12
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:34,060
It's an unfortunate thing that
happens during training sometimes.

13
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,940
Yeah. Eight. Uh, I kinda notice
it on a Sunday, you know,

14
00:00:36,941 --> 00:00:40,150
in the Tuesday we do the check ins
and everything and uh, I had the girl,

15
00:00:40,151 --> 00:00:41,360
I'm like, can you, you know,

16
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,950
put some makeup on it because I didn't
want nobody to find out. And uh,

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,840
even Tony Him, if he would
have saw it, he would have no,

18
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,690
he knew uncompromise all that. Um,
but yeah, it frustrated things.

19
00:00:52,691 --> 00:00:55,180
They make things a lot more complicated.
It put me,

20
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,220
it made the weight cut terrible.
Uh, just to go back to it.

21
00:01:00,221 --> 00:01:03,590
I mean I'm cutting from 76 to to fifties.

22
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:08,380
I had to be 55 for that fight and I
try my best to skim it down in about 12

23
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:13,000
hours. So I woke up at 5:00
AM with at about one 62.

24
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,090
Uh, and Wayans are
between nine and 11. Um,

25
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:22,230
and from 5:00 AM til 8:00 AM I had only
cut one pound compare to in other cuts

26
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,140
that have gone really well.

27
00:01:26,141 --> 00:01:29,740
I'll normally cut bout four or five
pounds in that time. But because I,

28
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,880
I just was feeling good and I wasn't
worried about it and the s and I was using

29
00:01:33,881 --> 00:01:36,460
the same temperature of water,
I was using the same everything,

30
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,640
but the staff made my
body hold onto the water.

31
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,840
So when I went down and checked and saw
that it was still like five pounds up

32
00:01:43,841 --> 00:01:46,980
with like two hours ago,
they started like throwing it,

33
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,860
boiling hot water on me to get my botany.
Yeah,

34
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:55,090
to give me sweating to get it off. It
was brutal. Yeah. That's for, for know.

35
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,600
For someone who doesn't,
never, never experienced staff.

36
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:03,240
Explain what does to your body,
it makes you feel the next day.

37
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,060
I just,
I felt so tired.

38
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,690
I never felt as tired
in my life and it felt,

39
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,520
I felt so tired to the point where I tried
to counteract it by getting myself as

40
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:17,460
pumped as I can. And the, you know,

41
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,440
do you normally get there
two hours before the fight?

42
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,980
When I walked into the arena that night,
two hours before I was in a sweat,

43
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,190
you know,
my body was like full of adrenaline.

44
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:28,400
Like I wasn't taking any medication.
You weren't going on in antibiotics.

45
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:32,360
He figured, did you have to decide whether
you should take antibiotics and then,

46
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,000
you know,
that compromises your endurance for sure.

47
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,650
Or just let your body fight it off.

48
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:40,770
I had it before I had been on the
antibiotics and they just make terrible,

49
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,910
you know, if you've ever been through
it. I mean, it's a terrible feeling.

50
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:48,540
So I just was like, you know what?
I think I can just push through it.

51
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,980
And I'm young and I was like, you know
what, fuck it. Like let's just go like,

52
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,570
did you try any like a
natural remedies oil?

53
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,200
You know,
it wasn't a whole lot I could take,

54
00:02:59,201 --> 00:03:01,670
cause I also got to cut the
weight still. Right. You know, uh,

55
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,890
some topical stuff that one of the
things they say that works really well,

56
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:08,500
topical, believe it or
not is mince. Garlic.

57
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,030
Garlic apparently has a tremendous
effect on staph infections.

58
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,420
I was swallowing whole cloves of ginger.
I remember I would take gender,

59
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:20,290
I would chop it up and I'll swallow
it, uh, to see if that would do some.

60
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,070
But you know, it's, yeah,

61
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,230
it's a hard battle cause some real
strong antibacterial properties.

62
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:28,450
And one of the people that have
been on the podcast, many times,

63
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:29,980
Doctor Rhonda Patrick said she,

64
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:34,930
she had dealt with some persistent
staph infection and she had like a whole

65
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:39,760
inner skin. And what she did was she
took garlic and packed it into that hole.

66
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:43,900
Jen and fucking killed it. I mean, Geez,
I wish I would've known that before.

67
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,600
I just kinda just fought through it.
I was like, fuck it, I'm just going.

68
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,620
Defense soap makes some really good stuff.
That too,

69
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:52,300
they make us these essential oils.

70
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:56,410
It's tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil
and you put it on like right where they

71
00:03:56,411 --> 00:04:01,140
have an issue. Where were you in in
October would have been there for you.

72
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,950
Anybody else there that has that staff?

73
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,180
Anytime you have any sort of a
ringworm or staff or anything,

74
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,440
there's some natural stuff. Not like
some bullshit homeopathic nonsense,

75
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:14,590
but some actual real natural
stuff that can help you.

76
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,630
And Defense soap specializes
in that because a guy sacco,

77
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,040
the guy who owns the
company, he is, you know,

78
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,780
coaches wrestling and deals with kids.
I'd always have ringworm staph infection,

79
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:27,190
so she can,
he came out with these soaps.

80
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:30,160
He's natural soaps that are
just designed for grapplers.

81
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,770
It's why it's called defense
soap. No. And then, um,

82
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:37,030
I'll have them send you some and then
the essential oils and balms and stuff

83
00:04:37,031 --> 00:04:40,450
like ointments for scratches and shit
like that. So they don't get infected.

84
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,290
That's, you know, Jim's,
it's, you're always getting
infected. Yeah. And that's it.

85
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,420
That was one of the biggest
focuses that this canvas,

86
00:04:46,421 --> 00:04:48,820
just like make sure I stay healthy because
they, if you don't have your health,

87
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:49,654
you don't have nothing.

88
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,530
And that was what it was at that
Tony fight and it's just, it,

89
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,270
it became something I didn't want to.

90
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,460
It was such a big event and it was my
first real big event to a that I just

91
00:05:00,461 --> 00:05:02,860
wanted it all just to
go right and go over.

92
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:07,600
But it ended up being just a lot of my,
by the staff originally.

93
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:10,990
I think it came from mental
stress, you know, it,

94
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,950
it was so many stresses going on,
you know, you really sure. Yeah.

95
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:17,380
You and you look at the three
biggest stressors, you know,

96
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,470
I was going through a divorce and
I had just moved into a house.

97
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,090
You look at those in a normal day to day
life that though those are like the two

98
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:25,780
biggest stressors.

99
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:30,010
You can have a then to add on fighting
for a world title in six weeks.

100
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,300
So I'm just like fucking go. Like, I was
like, you know, I wouldn't expect them to,

101
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,570
I was thinking maybe a,
they was gonna give me Tony,

102
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:40,600
but maybe in December indeed and in
Detroit or if something like that,

103
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:43,890
but he was like six weeks. I was
like, hi, what fog does, right.

104
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,750
They were thinking about doing you in
Detroit. Right. That was a, that was,

105
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,780
that was the talk. And you were
requesting a big fight in Detroit. Yeah,

106
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,270
that's where all my, like, you know,

107
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:55,360
every year I kind of Chore
Plan Out my year and a, and a,

108
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:58,760
and I got my vision in my head. Uh, I
got to call them water bowls in there.

109
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,470
That was one of them.
But yeah,

110
00:06:00,471 --> 00:06:03,740
it ended up putting a little bit
too much stress on me all at once.

111
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:07,700
And I took on a lot for that one. But
you did learn dot. Tell you what, man,

112
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,750
when you took him down and mounted him
and the first round I was like, Holy Shit,

113
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:13,340
cause I know how good
Tony is on the green.
