00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,710
Hello Freak bitches. I
Dunno, but I feel like,

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,710
remember when you told me that
story about the monkey that you had,

3
00:00:07,711 --> 00:00:09,840
that you had when you were on fear factor.

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,430
Beat my ass that when you held that little
thing you thought this thing's made a

5
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:18,450
word that that's what I feel
when I get you up on my shoulder.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,750
I'm like, damn, this thing's made a would

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,740
absolutely start beep do.
I was telling Jamie, I've,

8
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,150
I think I've told you this story,
I've probably told it to everybody.

9
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:35,151
I've met that I have a little baby chimp
on the a set of Newsradio like way back

10
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:37,140
in the day. It was supposed to be
in some stuff that I tell you this,

11
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,183
I probably said it before.

12
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,610
This little motherfucker was on my back
and he hit me a couple times and I was

13
00:00:41,611 --> 00:00:45,390
stunned. I was like, oh no, this
is not what I thought it was.

14
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,560
I thought it was like a
little person like, oh,

15
00:00:47,561 --> 00:00:50,460
this little person thinks he's a bad ass.
Let me just calm him down.

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,750
Now he got on top of HR. Just hit me a
couple times. On the back and I was like,

17
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:58,890
what in the fuck?
I just was thinking it immediately.

18
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:02,280
I started doing the math in my head and
thinking what it would be like to be

19
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,740
confronted by a full grown chimp.
Okay,

20
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,770
well that's my argument with
the silver back versus grizzly.

21
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,150
You said Grizzly because grizzlies or
even more and more of the fucking bad ass

22
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:16,350
than a chimp. Grizzly. Grizzly can't like,

23
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:19,650
there's no way a chimp can
outrun a grizzly. There's no
way. Not a chance in hell.

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,270
What's this? I don't know if that's
true. What is a silver back? Full speed.

25
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,100
I seen one of those things.
Grizzly can outrun a soda.

26
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,770
You know it. I'm strong. I feel confident.

27
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,520
I think chimps are faster than gorillas
and I think at grizzly can outrun a

28
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:40,230
chimp. Jan, I say for me, I think there's
no way the guerrillas getting fucked.

29
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:43,710
He's getting Denise, Dude,
I'm telling you right now,

30
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,790
big ass and tiering your hands
feel like when they shake mine.

31
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,560
So I would be, I guess I'm not
like a grizzly, but a giant dude

32
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,990
would crumple you like half empty pop.
It would even, it would even be like,

33
00:01:57,991 --> 00:02:01,620
he wouldn't even feel you. He would
go through you like whipped cream fee.

34
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,710
25 miles an hour. Top
speed. What does it say?

35
00:02:04,711 --> 00:02:09,711
Feels like 25 25 similar animals
speeds 34 but it feels like 25 I don't

36
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:16,020
understand. What that means is
from someone riding it's back.

37
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,790
Get to a different website that says,
is that really what this is?

38
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,140
Oh my God, I love the name.
What PD? Where'd that come from?

39
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,110
Do you know where that came from?
For elk speed of animals.com

40
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,480
a wall PD? Yeah. What does it, where does
that word come? That's what an elk is.

41
00:02:33,481 --> 00:02:38,310
Dude, I but I why? It's
actually a whopping who called
it the WAPA. What does that,

42
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,070
where does that name come from?
I've heard it. It's a cool name.

43
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,460
Wapa he Wednesdays the
Hashtag cam uses it a lot.

44
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:50,160
Powerful WAPA to Wednesday. Thanks champ.

45
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:53,360
I said it's silver band.
I don't want to know what my gap is.

46
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,650
What you think of champions faster?
Jump off there.

47
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,820
Don't you think in chip is faster
than a gorilla silver bag. Okay.

48
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,330
Have you seen a silver back come out
of the fricking, the jungle house

49
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,930
told you so? This is what I'm
thinking. Restraints. It's a,

50
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,890
it's just like an archery
argument. Yeah, maybe.

51
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:15,520
I think the bear gets a heavier
arrow, slower speed, fast Arrow,

52
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,460
but there's not much of a
difference in the speed.

53
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:22,470
It's real close and a grizzly
bear is so much bigger movement,

54
00:03:22,471 --> 00:03:27,471
so much more mass around like have a
big grizzly is 500 pounds a silver back.

55
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,690
I'm pretty sure. I mean a big grizzly
interior. Grizzly. What does a big one,

56
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,190
like 900 is that really not? I'm not a
mountain grizzly. What did you look it up?

57
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:37,450
I was there.
The more aggressive ones,

58
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,440
six or 700 and the really big
ones at the coastal ones. Right,

59
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,560
which they call brown bears
first rounders. Yeah. Why
do they call them that?

60
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:49,240
But because it's the same animal.
Different Specie, is it? Yes. Yeah.

61
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,320
Interbreed or anything bigger? The break.
There's just totally different bear.

62
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:53,540
Yeah.

63
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:58,390
One looks like a Volkswagen with hair
and one looks more like a Ford truck.

64
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,040
It's one of those other things where
the the one that has the scary,

65
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:06,340
your name is like not the biggest one,
which is weird.

66
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,020
Like Brown bear sounded like.
Oh he's so cuddly and yeah,

67
00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:14,680
those buses under brainiac
island. Yeah. Coke Klondike bars.

68
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,960
That's right. What would you do for a
Klondike Bar? I fucking, I'm your buddy.

69
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,710
I live in a place where there's no
vegetables. It's a conspiracy theory.

70
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,240
Told her bears brought that up.

71
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,780
They literally made those to
make themselves look cuddly.

72
00:04:28,781 --> 00:04:31,150
So humans would be stupid
enough to walk up to him.

73
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,220
Do you think it's like a nature trick?

74
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,030
Like nature made them cool to look at
so we don't mind as much that they're

75
00:04:37,031 --> 00:04:40,990
murderers. I would argue
Disney fucking Disney, right?

76
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,550
Like that Bambi movie.

77
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,900
So slower by 10 miles an hour to the,

78
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,720
is there anyone that has that I told you?
No.

79
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:53,890
But is there any strength of a
silver back versus a grizzly?

80
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:00,100
I say this saying I really respect grizzly
bears and brown bears cause you know

81
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:00,970
that.
Well,

82
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,750
Debbie's the concerns of a lot of
grizzly bears and brown bears that were

83
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:08,410
listening to them and they were there.
They're pumped. I think that, um,

84
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,880
they're all dangerous and ferocious
and I'm thinking silver back versus the

85
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,040
nigger is you think you would win?
Yeah.

86
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,460
Maybe people who listen to this podcast
and he said put it in the Po in the

87
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:20,890
posts. What we need to know
what people want to know.

88
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,760
I wouldn't want to fight a 38 pound rat.
No.

89
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,330
I be fucking terrified
to fight at 38 pound rat.

90
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:33,510
So the idea of 38 I just can't put a
number cause that's a fucking giant rat

91
00:05:33,551 --> 00:05:36,880
man. Yeah, but he should
have said 30 40. I know,

92
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:41,800
but like 38 get it.
What's a house cat weigh like 10 pounds?

93
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:46,300
No Way. Garfield waste
10. Okay. Like seven,

94
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:50,290
seven pounds. I'm like that. I would think
something along those lines. Okay, now,

95
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,010
now make it bigger. Like keep
it like a what? What size is it?

96
00:05:54,011 --> 00:05:56,680
Become totally unmanageable.
First off, let's,

97
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,930
if you're not wearing welding gloves
at 10 pound in shape house cat,

98
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:06,860
you're not fucking like Garfield.
You're talking like, I dunno.

99
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:11,510
Let's talk about a Conor Mcgregor
Garfield at coming in at 10,

100
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,590
like a real good tiger cat. Like
one of them, you know, those,

101
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:19,490
those ones like real common house cat
ones to look like a little picture of this

102
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,160
pic. If you grabbed a 10 pound mountain
lion, do you think you can control that?

103
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,930
There's no way. My neighbor, my neighbor,

104
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:33,770
a 38 pound, my neighbors,
good buddy of mine and he, uh,

105
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,070
he saw mountain lion and uh,

106
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,020
he saw a mountain lion when they was
walking his dogs get these little cutie

107
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:42,110
dogs. He's walking this little cutie
dogs and he saw this fucking thing,

108
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:47,090
so its tail and picked it up, picked the
dogs up and ran back to his house. And,

109
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:51,980
uh, then mark got on a website, got
on a website and found out that,

110
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:55,400
uh, that, that they attract
this animal and that it, uh,

111
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,200
it had a collar on it and uh,

112
00:06:57,201 --> 00:07:02,201
the tracked it and it got hit by a car
on the five and he's explaining like how

113
00:07:02,211 --> 00:07:04,670
the whole, the whole thing went
down. And I was like, Whoa,

114
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:08,750
like that you were walking
your dogs and this big ass cat.

115
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:12,680
I was like 120 pound plus cat.
So the actual cat that had a collar,

116
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:15,370
he knew that's the one he
encountered. Yeah. Yeah, he saw it.

117
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:19,070
He saw the collar and then he went on
the website and you can track because he,

118
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,880
he'd found out that this cat had died
and when he found out the cat died,

119
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:27,110
he went and uh, oh, the sound of whiskey.
Are you good? Yeah, I'm good dude.

120
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,280
Trust me, your Yeti talking a lot of
stupid shit. I never even touch that.

121
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,920
I definitely have. How dare you.
Are you one of those guys bro?

122
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,860
You ain't even been drunk cause
me bro. Quit bullying me. Sorry.

123
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,100
That's my instinct.
What we were just, what,

124
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,630
what the fuck was I just getting to eat?
I had on rat. Oh yeah. Among other things.

125
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:48,200
So a silver back is
essentially like a super,

126
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:52,150
a super prime it right. The
most super, super prime. Yes.

127
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:57,110
But a bear is one of the most super,

128
00:07:57,111 --> 00:08:02,060
Super Freak Predator animal freak out.
Things like if a bear was little,

129
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:06,260
like a nine pound bear, like the size of
a nine pound rat was trying to kill you,

130
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,610
you'd be freaking the fuck out. If it
was running at like a little tiny bear,

131
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:12,140
you'd be fucking terrified.

132
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,690
Now think of a giant
one and realize how you,

133
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,220
you are totally defenseless and I
don't think it's going to be that much

134
00:08:19,221 --> 00:08:24,221
difference for Adam will literally think
of a silver back gorilla with the way

135
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:26,150
they're built and they swing around.

136
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:30,380
I think if he stood on the chest of a
grizzly can grab its paws and literally

137
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:35,360
rip its arms out and beat it with it.
Wow. That's King Kong was a good movie.

138
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:39,860
I agree with you there. I enjoyed it as
much as the next day thinking it Kong.

139
00:08:39,861 --> 00:08:42,920
But I believe that I'm
talking think that's correct.

140
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,020
I don't think they're that strong.
The thumb,

141
00:08:45,021 --> 00:08:48,460
the thumb doves does give an advantage
though, right? It could grab, wait,

142
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,790
it's a little smarter.
Yes. Yeah. Jamie. Great.

143
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,490
But he just the barest way stronger,
way stronger. Way Stronger.

144
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,950
It could smack at once.
I've seen that.

145
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,580
I've seen a grown mountain
grizzly hit a moose and can, yeah.

146
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,190
You told me that, that I've seen you
saw it with your own eyes. Right, right.

147
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:13,680
Is there any solid information of strength
of a silver back for it and there's

148
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:14,250
not,

149
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,220
there's just a lot of people have argued
this on the Internet for the last five

150
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:20,070
to 10 we get dangerously close
to this argument. Seriously.

151
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:24,360
Why don't they put Thor's hammer
on the ground have and like put a,

152
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,560
put a Taco in it or something to where
a grizzly has to try to grab it and pull

153
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:32,700
it off and have a sensor versus
the silver back down. Well,

154
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:35,700
the grizzly would definitely can't grab
as hard because it doesn't have thumbs

155
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:39,570
like we talked about, but I think,
yeah, but that's relative to a beating,

156
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,760
right?
Who,

157
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,790
how many fighters have a big
ass and a lot of like leg power,

158
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:51,450
cro, cough versus someone
that's just sheer grill up top.

159
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,860
Let's do go there.

160
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:57,180
I just wonder how strong a gorilla really
is in comparison to which essentially

161
00:09:57,181 --> 00:10:01,500
like a giant dog. I just think
he's going to get far you crazy.

162
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,200
You think a silver back is
equivalent to a giant dog? A bearers?

163
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,020
What I'm saying is a bear. A bear is
like essentially like a giant house. Wow.

164
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,710
Why would I call it silver backhoe?
Put Dog.

165
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:23,530
Yeah.
