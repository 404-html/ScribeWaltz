1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,700
The joe rogan experience. See like if
you're booing a basketball game, Huh?

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,593
Maybe I got it.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,310
I guess like there's something that's
so much more intense about a fight.

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,530
Especially like there's smart booze.

5
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:18,510
Like when someone does something illegal
or someone does something she could

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,570
stall week. Yeah. Or something. Someone
does something that's fucked up.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,890
There's smart boots,

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,040
but then there's booze where guys were
just like facing each other and they're

9
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,180
canceling each other out.

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,620
Like you're watching a Billy high level
thing when these guys are trying to

11
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:32,720
solve what,

12
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,140
what do I have to do to connect on this
guy's fucking brainstem and knock his

13
00:00:37,141 --> 00:00:37,860
lights out.

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,640
But we don't have to do is
marketing toward these casual
fans who are basketball

15
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:44,490
fans and football fans who aren't
really the people who are hardcore who

16
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:47,910
appreciate the martial arts side of it.
What these guys are putting into it.

17
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,920
You think so?
I think that just marketing,

18
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,290
I don't think they're marketing
towards any specific fan.

19
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:54,510
They're not marketing towards,
people don't understand that.

20
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,690
But I think that's the almost the same
thing cause they're just trying to get a

21
00:00:57,691 --> 00:01:00,570
mass audience. And the majority of
people aren't people who really,

22
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,610
people say that though.
What makes you say they're trying?

23
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:08,370
Like what are they doing specifically?
Um, I feel like when they put together,

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,400
you know, fights, it don't necessarily
make sense in terms of rankings.

25
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:13,130
When they put the interim belts on,

26
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:14,850
on fights where don't
really need to be there.

27
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:18,300
You just know it's a marketing move.
Cause I think a, a title on a poster,

28
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:20,340
we'll probably sell that many
more tickets. Good point.

29
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:24,000
It definitely juices it up when you have
an interim title it like in marketing

30
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:24,840
dude, it's going like, oh yeah,

31
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:28,200
we saw this many more paper vision
and as the title and I don't know the

32
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:30,000
difference between the interim
title or a regular title.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,880
A lot of the casuals don't know the
difference between Michael Bisping or

34
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:35,160
fucking doors. Samp yeah,
look, I'm with you set a bar.

35
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,910
I almost feel conflicted because I have
this part of me that's like a purist

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,511
that's like,
no,

37
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:42,600
it should be just like whoever number
one is versus the champion and we should

38
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:44,880
never fuck around.
That's how it was going for a long time.

39
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,230
If they were just like, oh, you know what,

40
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,660
we just set up Nick Diaz versus
Conor Mcgregor. I'd be like,

41
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:52,170
that's the greatest thing that's ever
happened and I don't care. I don't care.

42
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,370
I don't care if Khabib's one
72 fights in a row campus,

43
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:01,110
I'm flying to fight a
hundred out of 100 times.

44
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:02,790
I don't give a fuck where he's fighting,
who he's fighting.

45
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:05,100
It's just fun and it's exciting,
but let's get real.

46
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,540
I think there was something really pure
and it's beautiful, but MMA is that.

47
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,370
It's always going to kind
of figure itself out.

48
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:13,020
It is the greatest sport
because it's the greatest sport.

49
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:16,050
I didn't think it happened any
given Sunday. It's inherently built.

50
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,780
The marketing has sort of built
in already, right? So you can,

51
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,300
you can create a pecking order,

52
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,890
you can create rankings and I think
you can kind of just say, hey,

53
00:02:22,891 --> 00:02:25,110
the pieces are going to fall where they're
going to fall and it's always going

54
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,040
to be super exciting.

55
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,720
And you see with the way they handle
Connor or certain guys, they definitely,

56
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,990
they threw that to the side. And I think
Conor is a great example of it as well.

57
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:36,030
Why they don't really care though.
Like I fuck it dude.

58
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,110
Go Do may whether they had it for a little
while, was that part of the promotion?

59
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,050
Yeah, they made millions
of dollars off that thing.

60
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,900
Everybody made a fuck load of money.
I mean,

61
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:49,470
may whether made hundreds of millions.
Connor made 100 million.

62
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:50,670
I don't know what the UFC made.

63
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,620
Everybody got fucking crazy paid and
then they started zoo for boxing and now

64
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:59,500
there are other offering,
uh, uh, Joshua and Joshua,

65
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:01,780
you're offering 500 million.
I'm crazy contract.

66
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:05,200
Apparently that might be bullshit. I don't
haven't asked anybody if that's real,

67
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,500
but I'm not surprised. They realize this
is a lot of money and promoting fights,

68
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:12,940
whether it's promoting MMA. Dana has
a big background in boxing. You know,

69
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:15,370
his son actually just had a,
a, an amateur boxing fight.

70
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,780
I saw that in his Instagram. Yeah, he
loves boxing. Fuck. Dana loves boxing.

71
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,930
So I always loved it. So it's not
unusual that they decided to go into it.

72
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,530
But with Connor it was like one of
those things where you're like, yeah,

73
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,700
that's what you're supposed to do.

74
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:30,250
If may with a really wants to fight
Connor and Connor has never had a

75
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,940
professional fight and you make a hundred
million bucks. Let's see, let's see,

76
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:34,803
let's see who buys it.

77
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,260
But I'm just saying as an MMA purists
were what's best for the sport of MMA,

78
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:41,200
that's not necessarily the best
move and not, oh it's not bad. Both.

79
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,540
It doesn't hurt it at
all because first of all,

80
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:48,570
it shows you that in the specialties that
there are people that have skills and

81
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:52,270
techniques and abilities that just
far exceed the very best MMA fighters.

82
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,210
And you saw that with Conor and
Floyd flood just fucked him up.

83
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,010
He just fucked him up. But Connor caught
them a little bit and he'd tell them,

84
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,830
tag them in the beginning and you could
say that Floyd wasn't going full tilt

85
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:05,140
and he probably wasn't.
I would say definitely wasn't.

86
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,200
He was definitely trying to wear him out
and get him tired cause he knew that he

87
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:10,390
relied and kinetic energy
for the first round or two,

88
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,270
but he's still got clip with a shot.
He did want to get clipped with. Sure.

89
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,560
I think Floyd wanted to see what Connor
was doing and he spent the first few

90
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:20,500
rounds like kind of taking in
data and like seeing like, okay,

91
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:24,450
what are you doing here? What Weird Shit
are you trying? But still I was like,

92
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,580
I did not think Connor was going
to do that good. Very well.

93
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,580
I thought it would be over within three
or four rounds and may whether it would

94
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:33,820
knock him out and he would just outclass
him in the fact that it went 10 and

95
00:04:33,821 --> 00:04:37,810
then even landed some shots.
I, I was pretty impressed
with by itself. That's like,

96
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:41,640
it's not bad for, as a purist I'm
saying it's almost like it's the,

97
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,630
the way they're sort of letting
Connor run the show. Um,

98
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,800
I just kind of feel like the UFC sort
of always built this brand UFC. It's,

99
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:51,011
you know,

100
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:56,011
it's a cocacola of MMA and I feel like
Connor has basically become bigger or at

101
00:04:57,281 --> 00:05:00,370
the very least as big as the
UFC. And he does, he did,

102
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:02,140
he doesn't give a shit tweet.
He tweeted out the other day,

103
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:04,560
I'm the boss and he was
promoting the video game like a,

104
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,120
they did a pull them up with Dana
white is the one of the characters. Um,

105
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:12,760
but I just feel like that
wasn't necessarily the best
thing for mixed martial

106
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:13,594
arts as a sport.

107
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,660
I almost feel like what they were doing
with isn't it hurt it at all? Yeah, maybe.

108
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:19,300
Maybe. I think it's, I think it made
it bigger. I mean it's like, dude,

109
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:22,330
what Connor created was
like a thing that's like,

110
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,960
it's just really hard dude.
Even when,

111
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,660
when he fought up Marcus [inaudible]
image as his first fight in the UFC,

112
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,860
and I remember,
I'll raise it,

113
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:34,060
there was like an energy in the crowd
about Conor fight and even know who this

114
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:37,210
guy was. And you're like, why
is this like such a big thing?

115
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:40,570
And then every fight was just a
bigger and bigger and bigger thing.

116
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,290
And then we create this thing where like
Dustin portrays like biggest fight ever

117
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:48,100
as against Conor McGregor and Dustin
had had way more big fights than him,

118
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,890
but still the big deal was that you're
fighting this guy. Like he just,

119
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,790
he would create these stages just that
it was the results. Like you put markers.

120
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,380
Yeah, he starts dust in the first
round slept Josie Aldo in 13 seconds.

121
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,450
It was all real accomplishments. No, it
wasn't. Why him fighting Floyd Mayweather.

122
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:08,690
It was interesting because he
was so exceptional as a striker.

123
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,570
But do you think that this,
I,

124
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,660
I give the UFC so much credit with
building con Conor McGregor because he

125
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:16,190
wouldn't have been able
to do that anywhere else.

126
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:19,940
Like the UFC is such a big brand that
he couldn't have been a belt warfighter

127
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:24,230
fighter and become, uh, you
know, a worldwide name the
way he is now. Probably not.

128
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:28,070
If it's, which is weird, it bell towards
a stupid name. They need to accept that

129
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,440
good for him.
They need to accept the money.
