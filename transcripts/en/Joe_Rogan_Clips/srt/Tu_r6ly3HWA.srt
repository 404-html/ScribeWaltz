1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,970
Some border restaurants actually
deliver across the border. Okay,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,020
so you live across the border.
Now that won't work. We
won't deliver. That's great.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,100
If you deliver across, the board
isn't working. If you don't deliver,

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,630
Oh don't cross the border,
you're fine.

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,240
What about if you use one of those
third party delivery services?

6
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:15,420
You know where they use an app and they
order something and the APP would be the

7
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:18,750
people who are actually doing delivery
would be responsible. You would not. Okay.

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,000
As long as that. As long as that
company's based New York state.

9
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,770
So this keeps all the money
in New York state. No,

10
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,590
it didn't give all the money in,
you know, stay good amount of it.

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,680
It gives the small business owner a
shot at competing as large businesses,

12
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:35,250
which almost always cross borders. Right.
Gives farmers a much greater incentive.

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,550
Yes. And to be more farm
to table. The less stuff.

14
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,550
Now I've got to help my farmers out. My
New York state farmers are hurting badly.

15
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,540
That's one idea.

16
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,020
But the second thing is you want to
treat farmers like small businesses and

17
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:48,810
they're not,
which means they don't get the SBA loans.

18
00:00:48,811 --> 00:00:50,460
They don't get help and
get treated that way.

19
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:52,890
It does not work when you treat
him like small businesses.

20
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,770
But next I want to completely legalized
a hemp and cannabis and I'm going to

21
00:00:57,771 --> 00:01:01,350
have, you're talking and I want to
regulate them like onions, onions,

22
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,020
like onions and my joking like onions,
onions.

23
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,290
Here's the reason why a lot of onions
coming out of New York. That's right. Yes.

24
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:11,670
So my onions and no one cares. Bingo.
Exactly correct. And here's the issue.

25
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:15,300
There are three reasons why I want to
legalize hemp and cannabis and most of the

26
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:16,650
things you want to get high.
No,

27
00:01:16,651 --> 00:01:20,600
the only drug I use is cannabis is
cannabis is a caffeine. Oh, cell.

28
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,970
This is the only drug. Freud. Yeah, I
like that. That's about cannabis. I know,

29
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:26,650
but if I use cannabis, I
would happily tell you. Right.

30
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,690
So I don't have him to hide. Why not
happily tell you can use it. Not My thing.

31
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,270
I get paranoid and worried about the
school system. When you get hired.

32
00:01:33,271 --> 00:01:36,630
I think I talk even more.
I don't want to talk even more.

33
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:40,770
Do I know I would have not
not be introspective. You
might sit back and go, God,

34
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:44,250
I talk too much. Yeah, maybe then I
can mushrooms and I could have this.

35
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,730
I've never done mushrooms. Mushrooms
are, I feel like I've talked too much.

36
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,960
So maybe, maybe I should try them one
day. I've never done mushrooms. Mushrooms.

37
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:55,680
That makes me uncomfortable. Yes.
Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm 50.

38
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,410
Yeah, I'm 51 there we go. You've
never done mushrooms? Never.

39
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,480
So somebody came up to you go,
Larry, you want to do some mushrooms?

40
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:03,660
And you're like, no man. One day I want to
be governor. That's what I was thinking.

41
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:08,370
I was seven and I thought Debbie governor
went to a fucking seven year old.

42
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,980
Oh, that's what I'm saying. Are
you hanging around? You got it.

43
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:14,430
You don't understand why, where I grew
up, when I grew up where I can go up now.

44
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:18,900
I grew up in south Bronx. Oh, even more
crazy. It was crazy. And then Tim dog.

45
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,640
I don't know who, Tim Dogs,
sorry, I haven't been in the
Bronx. South Bronx. Sorry.

46
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,730
I haven't been in the Bronx and
many years I'll address. But anyway,

47
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,110
wasn't secure. Reference Mushrooms
and marijuana. Yes. Thank you.

48
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,190
You've never smoked pot?
I have not. No. Never.

49
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,520
Never have what I can't ever have
behind you, bro. Sorry. Never had.

50
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,350
What kind of square are you? Didn't
snow. No Pie. I am mushrooms.

51
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,980
Acid? Nope. Do you want to try it? Maybe
one day. Liver right now. No, not now. No,

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,290
no, no, no. I'm running a campaign, my
friend. Oh yes. But they kept paying.

53
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,400
It would help you then. Odds are no
talking to them. The seventh. Okay.

54
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,200
And I'm a seventh to be forward. I'm
not against any of these things. Right?

55
00:02:59,201 --> 00:03:02,740
It's your body. You own your body.
Okay. So if I, if I tried cannabis,

56
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,600
now don't drink either.
You don't ever drink,

57
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,100
not even a glass of wine with dinner. If
people are around drinking, I'll drink.

58
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,680
Right. But I don't, I don't
have any alcohol in my house.

59
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,800
I don't drink unless all
those were drinking. Okay.
I'll socially drink again. I,

60
00:03:15,801 --> 00:03:18,280
I'm getting out of bed
with Theresa will drink.

61
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,220
You are focused for most of your
life has been what business? Uh,

62
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,030
first it was military.
I was a marine for seven years and then,

63
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,450
and then it was business.
Yes. So you're just uh,

64
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,650
keep your nose to the grindstone kind of
guy? Yes. Done. How else could I do this?

65
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,640
Have you seen my campaign?
This is the,

66
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,720
the last three gubernatorial campaigns
in New York state combined didn't raise

67
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:44,380
$10,000 combined.
I raised over a quarter million already.

68
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,520
The last three gubernatorial candidates
combined didn't do anywhere near the

69
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:50,290
amount of stops I've made
and I stuck too much.

70
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:54,050
Like how much is Cynthia Nixon
raise a 1.7, I think male, you know,

71
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,120
he didn't that crazy. People getting
behind sex in the city a lot.

72
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,600
There's a lot of that menopause money out
there, bro. I need some of that I guess.

73
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,730
I Dunno. It's flipping it around. My
point being yes, nose to the grindstone.

74
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:09,880
I'm doing this. Of course. I believe
it's lily. No mushrooms though. Huh?

75
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,930
No Mushrooms? No. Maybe later.
No wait till November 7th.

76
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,800
And then once you hit, then maybe
we'll see maybe your party with me.

77
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,490
Maybe if I win, I can't do it while
while I'm governor. That would be,

78
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:23,140
that would be, that
would be not, not cool,

79
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,640
but marijuana isn't it legal in
New York state? No, still not.

80
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,200
You have to have serious
diseases, right? That's correct.

81
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,860
Medical and you fix that of
course. Why the point? Yeah,

82
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:34,250
that seems really propositive.

83
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:38,270
My whole point on cannabis and hemp is
heavily because of farmers also, right?

84
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,910
Small farmers right now, yes, particular
has yes. Holy uncontroversial.

85
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:46,600
And it's a fantastic commodity.
It's good, it's good for the soil,

86
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:48,250
it's good for the environment.

87
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,550
And the best thing is if you treat
small farmers like small businesses,

88
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:56,020
they can now specialize and they can
specialize in hip and then also create

89
00:04:56,021 --> 00:04:58,660
products in their farm.
Then with specialized hemp products,

90
00:04:58,661 --> 00:05:02,040
they can do that and create
niche industries. Right.

91
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,730
And we see that in New York
state with both coffee and um,

92
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,790
and breweries we said already
happening in New York state.

93
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,410
And you would have the same sort of, uh,
incentives for them to sell in New York.

94
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,570
Absolutely. Yes. So particularly hemp,

95
00:05:13,571 --> 00:05:17,350
which would be incredibly beneficial with
zero controversy. That's correct. Yes.

96
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:19,840
Of like psychoactive effects.
It doesn't have people,

97
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,750
people would be very happy to do
that. Right. But cannabis too,

98
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,090
because I want you to be able
to create cannabis products,

99
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,860
but there's something else and that is,

100
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,150
there are a lot of people in this country,

101
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,460
but I'll talk about New York state
specifically who have chronic pain.

102
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,590
And right now they have three choices,

103
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,540
one opioid and maybe get addicted to
suffer, which I don't accept all three.

104
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,320
What people tell me,
and for some reason that again,

105
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,190
it's only been women who've told me this,
they walk up to me and say, you know,

106
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,500
Laurie,

107
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,730
I hope you can legalize marijuana because
I smoke a little at night so I can go

108
00:05:45,731 --> 00:05:49,570
to sleep. What about CBD? CBD is legal
in your state wasn't? I don't think so.

109
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,110
It's not, I don't think it is fucking, I
don't, you know, that's a good question.

110
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:55,780
I don't think it is. That's
crazy. Swipe medicinal. No, sorry.

111
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:59,150
It's probably medicinal CBD. Probably
minute. That'd be my assumption.

112
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,290
But CBD has no psychoactive effects,
no side effects. It comes out of it.

113
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:07,880
It comes to cannabis, right? So I,
I think we'll look it up real quick.

114
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:09,680
I think it's just,
I think it's medical in New York state.

115
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,020
So we do have some sort of a
doctor's prescription to get CBD.

116
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,680
So my point is if it's onion, you
can grow it in your backyard, right?

117
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,130
Great medicine. Your backyard,
right? If we heavily, yes,

118
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,660
if we heavily regulate cannabis
and or hemp, big business wins,

119
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,650
small business loses guaranteed it
will become big business cronyism.

120
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,690
The small farmers collapse.
It's the wrong answer, right?

121
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,970
So we need to make that happen.

122
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:34,880
And people already spoken it and
maybe you don't want to smoke it.

123
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:37,640
Why don't you have an edible?
Why don't Ya, I have liquid.

124
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:40,140
Why don't you have whatever's your thing,
you don't have to smell it.

125
00:06:40,141 --> 00:06:41,240
If you want to smoke it,
please smoke it.

126
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:45,890
But there's many ways of of taking
advantage of, of both THC and CBD,

127
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:49,100
which you prefer. And look,
it's your body, not mine.

128
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,970
And why in the world what I want you to
have to live with chronic pain if you

129
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:55,590
don't have to write anything.
I'm not about being right, Judy,

130
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,630
because CVD again is not
psychoactive. Isn't legal. Yeah. Okay.

131
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:03,290
It is legal in New York. There we
go. It's pretty legal everywhere.

132
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:07,700
CBD because of the fact that it doesn't
have any psychoactive effects and it's

133
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,560
fantastic for people with arthritis. And
so we go, older folks are, I mean, shit,

134
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:16,910
I got Ted Nugent taking it. How about like
that? He's never even touched anything.

135
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,850
10 Nunu related does.
He likes my Facebook stuff.
