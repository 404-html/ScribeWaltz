1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,820
Okay. So I'm not, I'm not like
a big drug guy by any means,

2
00:00:02,821 --> 00:00:06,750
but I think you'll love this story
on this Amazon trip I told you about,

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,000
we land on this airstrip
and then this plan we meet,

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,060
we get into this village and I'm
like, cool, boats have made it here.

5
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:15,490
It took the boats five days. We're going
to head up river, right? And are like,

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,760
translators, like you can't do that
yet. I'm like, what do you mean?

7
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:19,770
Like we've spent months planning this.
He's like,

8
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:24,180
you have to have the Shamans blessing
to go up river. And I'm like, okay,

9
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:25,800
what does that mean? He's
like, come to the Maloca,

10
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:28,650
which is the like spiritual house.
So we go to the spiritual house,

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,550
we sit around and we talk and we talk
and we talk and it's like hours of not

12
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:33,660
like asking him to go,

13
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:37,440
but just like almost like
idle conversation where he's
almost like interviewing

14
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:40,260
and it's like, well what are you doing?
Where are you going? Where are you from?

15
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,630
And he doesn't really understand
any of this, right? He's like,

16
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,440
he's living in this community. Long
story short, he goes, okay, you can go,

17
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,410
but you have to take this
blessing. And we're like, sure,

18
00:00:49,411 --> 00:00:53,310
we'll whatever you need for us to go.
So he pulls out the snail shell.

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,330
I could show you a picture of it.

20
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:59,130
It's a snail shell with a monkey bone
and the top and a tube worm to close it.

21
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,220
And in the snail shell is this
green powder and he's like,

22
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:03,570
this is what you need for the blessing.

23
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,900
So he goes around the circle
and threw a monkey bone pipe.

24
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:10,900
He blows this green stuff. And your
nose is it called the COO? Hey, not,

25
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,820
not say that word that we
heard. I couldn't tell the
name of the pipe. No, no.

26
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:19,440
The stuff they blow up your nose
is a DMT. It, it's coca leaf. Oh.

27
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,510
Mixed with a bunch of a root and tobacco
I believe. Like altogether. And um,

28
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,550
anyway, so he goes, there's
five of us in my crew.

29
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:29,190
He goes around the circle and he hits
three guys and they will go, whoa.

30
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:31,890
My brain feels like I've got chlorine
on the head. You know, whatever.

31
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,140
Loads it into your nose.
Yeah. So it gets really close.

32
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:38,100
It's got this long tubular monkey bone
pipe and he goes and it just blows it up

33
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:40,470
into your nose and a hits.

34
00:01:40,471 --> 00:01:43,740
Three of my guys and I'm watching a little
bit nervous cause like I'm very like

35
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,490
standoffish on drugs. Like I know
things affect me very strangely. Anyway,

36
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:50,860
hits three of my guys, they go whoa, you
know, eyes watering and they're like, wow,

37
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:55,830
it's a, it's actually a great
feeling. Gets to my turn in the nose.

38
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,690
All of a sudden I feel like I've got acid
on my brain, like chlorine in my head.

39
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,340
I break into the sweat,

40
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,740
my eyes explode and I'm like
wobbling like this. And it,

41
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,560
30 seconds later I'm just curled
over in the fetal position,

42
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:15,540
just projectile vomiting cannot hold
it together. And uh, Lorenzo, this,

43
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,490
the tribal shaman goes good, good.
And we're like, why is this good?

44
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:23,580
And he's like, he had a bad spirit
in him. If he had gone up the river,

45
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,220
he would've been killed.
He's just got the bad spirit out.

46
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,710
This is why I had to bless you.
Now you can go.

47
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,040
And I was the only one that had hit
like that out of our five person crew.

48
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,140
Everybody else was like,
oh my brain sore, whatever.

49
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:38,430
I was literally fetal position,
feverish, puking cray.

50
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,450
And I've never done any drugs like hard
drugs. Like it's just not my thing.

51
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,740
And this thing just hit me like a
ton of bricks. After he said that.

52
00:02:46,741 --> 00:02:50,550
Did you think was there a po,
I mean you're a scientist,
you're a very smart guy,

53
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,020
but was there a part of you that
was like, man, this guy, right? Yes.

54
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,810
That's what's so crazy.
Cause I'm a fucking scientist.

55
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:59,230
I don't want to believe that.

56
00:02:59,231 --> 00:03:03,190
I don't want to believe fucking jungle
medicine made me not die. But this guy,

57
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:06,580
here I am. Nobody else fucking affected.
I'm sitting in the fetal position,

58
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:09,070
puking my brains out and the guys
going, good, now you'll be safe.

59
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,980
And the whole fucking trip, I've got
that in the back of my mind going,

60
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,430
maybe the whole reason nothing's going
wrong is because I just had green fucking

61
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:19,990
powder bloat up my nose. Whoa.
Yeah. Super Weird. And I,

62
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,910
nothing has ever affected me like that.

63
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,330
I mean curled up puking
and I was shivering. Well,

64
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:28,130
you trying to make logical
sense out of this. We try.

65
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,940
Was there ever a thought we like maybe
in this extreme environment that's so

66
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,250
utterly different than any other place
in the world that these rules are

67
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:44,110
different? Absolutely. I mean,
I, I'm sitting there going,
going into it. I'm like,

68
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:47,230
cool, yeah, I'll do this stupid powder
if it means I can go on my expedition,

69
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:49,660
you know what I mean?
Like I'm not like embracing it.

70
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,650
I'm just like going through the motion
to get my job done as a scientist.

71
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,510
And then I had this experience,

72
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:58,300
and I'm not saying I was enlightened
or a woken or anything like that,

73
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:03,570
but all of a sudden I
attributed my success and my
safety in small part to this

74
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,700
green fucking powder blown up my nose
by a sham and throw a monkey bone.

75
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,240
And the thing about it is,
even if that's not true,

76
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:18,270
if you think it's true and then you wind
up being okay and you have confidence

77
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:22,810
that you're going to be okay and maybe
you have less anxiety and make better

78
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:25,450
critical decisions because you think
that everything's going to work out.

79
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:30,310
Exactly. Exactly. Totally. Because I
was super focused on my mission, uh, we,

80
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,870
we were very, very successful
in what we set out to do. And I,

81
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,760
I feel like because I had that crazy
experience and here's this old little

82
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:43,270
jungle Indian going,
now you're now you're going to be okay.

83
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,680
I didn't have any anxiety going into
the situation and before that I had no

84
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:51,910
thought of it ever playing apart. Well
like the mind fuck of the placebo effect.

85
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:54,070
Right? Totally. We know that that's real.

86
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,690
So there's a some sort of a physical
effect by believing that something works.

87
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,210
Right,
but is there a physical,

88
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:04,390
is there a change in the way
you interface with reality?

89
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:09,570
If you believe that you've experienced
some sort of spiritual enrichening and

90
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:14,980
then some sort of a, some bad spirit
has been released from your body.

91
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,480
Is that possible?
I think so.

92
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,740
I think it changes your own reality
because of your perception of the outside

93
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:24,310
world. That is a freaky thing for a
scientist to say. Right, right. And,

94
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:29,290
and this is like, I am a
hardcore academic, I've never
considered spirituality,

95
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,670
religion,
anything.

96
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:34,600
And I had this just fucking 10 days
ago this crazy experience that has like

97
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,910
changed my mindset on,
uh,

98
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,410
on crazy jungle medicine and
drugs and catching animals,

99
00:05:41,411 --> 00:05:44,350
everything because of this one guy blew
crap up my nose and I puked everywhere.

100
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,210
Wow. Now has this made you want to
experiment with other plant medicines? No.

101
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:54,400
The only reason I did that is because it
was a necessity to do what I was doing.

102
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,100
It was coming from an expert,
if you will,

103
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,470
a person who saw it as a
necessity to do what I was doing.

104
00:06:00,471 --> 00:06:03,370
And I was under his guidance
to go out and, you know,

105
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,920
pick a mushroom and try it and
have an experience is I don't,

106
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,330
I don't see the benefit in that.

107
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:12,650
But when someone who lives in that
community embraces that wild jungle says,

108
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:15,620
this is my home and this is how you do it,
I will absolutely do it.

109
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,440
So you do it like out of
respect. Absolutely. Yeah.
