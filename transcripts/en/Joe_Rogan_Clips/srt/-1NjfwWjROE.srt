1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,690
Now,

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,690
where you're at now is a very interesting
situation because John is in exile.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,370
No one knows what's going to happen
in terms of how long it's going to be

4
00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:13,350
suspended. DC is now fighting Steve Bay
Meo chicks for the heavyweight title.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,660
And who knows what's happening there.
I mean that,

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,680
does that bother you because it seems
like it Kinda like puts the two oh five

7
00:00:19,681 --> 00:00:24,460
title in limbo. It does. It does. Oh,

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,400
I didn't see that coming at all. This is
typified at all. You know, it's a, it's a,

9
00:00:29,401 --> 00:00:32,810
it's a great fight for, for them
and for the financing for the sport.

10
00:00:32,811 --> 00:00:37,200
But you know, for us standing,
standing in line, we just, you know,

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,260
we just sitting there on our, on our,
we just sitting there and waiting for,

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,490
for an opportunity and it's not going
to come. It's not going to be there. So,

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,680
you know, and, and, and uh, you know,

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,320
that that's also a thing that had
been motivated me a lot because

15
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,800
often if I were glove,
I got engine and,

16
00:00:55,801 --> 00:01:00,210
and all that and I was really looking
forward to come back and, and, and make,

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,800
make it really strong,
uh, performing, you know,

18
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,370
very strong next performance.
I just really wanted to,

19
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:12,980
I had my eyes on that goal
and, and uh, and then they met,

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,530
I actually counted almost, you
know, fighting DC, but then,

21
00:01:17,531 --> 00:01:21,180
then it was all gone by him going
up the step. And so, so it's,

22
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:26,040
it's a crisis situation. The
whole division is, is you
just crazy right now? Yeah,

23
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:29,610
it really is because that fight is not
even going to take place until July.

24
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,550
So here we are in April, May, June, July,

25
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:35,070
we have three months till
that fight takes place.

26
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,240
So that fight and then
obviously it least three months,

27
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:43,230
most likely more before the title
could be challenged again. So that's,

28
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,970
we don't even know if it's
coming, if it comes back. Right.

29
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,960
He might notice what happens in that
fight unless once he gets used to eating

30
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:52,800
again, like, you know, it's to be
tough on you see wins. I see, I see.

31
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,650
I see it in pictures. You know, I'm
going to meet him a couple of days.

32
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,310
It looks a little bit, you
know, heavy right now. Well,

33
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:02,910
he was a on TV the other day eating
potato chips and you're in a cab.

34
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:09,180
No, I loved that. Yeah. He loves food,
that's for sure. I mean, and uh, I,

35
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,540
you know, you look back at his performance
in strike force as a heavyweight.

36
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,430
It was phenomenal. Good, good,
phenomenal. If you didn't lose,

37
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,520
I didn't lose that heavyweight and he's
good tossed around gorillas like Josh

38
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,500
Barnett lift him up. Like nothing
crazy. This fight against TTIP.

39
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:29,640
It's, uh, you know, if it will be another,

40
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:32,190
I guess another heavyweight, I'd probably
60 people. It's going to win this fight.

41
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:36,390
But do you see, it's like you said,
he's, he's a really good heavyweight, so,

42
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,670
and those, what happens? Well, his
wrestling is just so next level. Yeah.

43
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,370
It's such a, it's an interesting position
because Steve Basie, very good wrestler,

44
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,550
but of course DC's worldclass hey,
it's world class and he,

45
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,410
he doesn't take one step back.
May just comes out been,

46
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:55,380
and he's just in your face.
And it's tough to count out Steve Bay too,

47
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:59,070
because Steve Bay's though pound for
pound consensus. Best heavy weight ever.

48
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,230
I mean, the guy is defend the title more
than anybody. You look at his resume,

49
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,280
it's impeccable.

50
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,360
You Max out a junior dos Santos nax
out Overeem of beats Francis in Ghana,

51
00:03:08,751 --> 00:03:13,420
who was everybody's scared of.
I mean, he's a bad ass. Yeah.

52
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,860
So you know, but the seats, he such a
competitive guy, you know, he, he does,

53
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,290
he doesn't want, he doesn't take a
step back and he just goes for it.

54
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,200
Even if even in a tough situation,
he's just,

55
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:26,440
he just eats it and comes
back and do what to do always.

56
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,640
And therefore for being a fat guy

57
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,150
that gets books, he's screaming at
you right now. Hey man, settle down.

58
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,810
But that guy is, he's doing
fire rounds like nothing. Yeah.

59
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,990
So the creek nation in is on top. Yeah.
He just eats the wrong food. Yeah.

60
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,890
That's awesome. Yeah. I mean, I
mean, maybe some of it's genetic.

61
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,580
I just think it has eaten the wrong
food. I mean, this evidence. Sure.

62
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,910
Chips. Yeah. I mean, there was evidence.

63
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:56,260
It's not like I'm just
talking out of my ass.

64
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,010
I've seen him eat the wrong
food at me too. Yeah. But yeah,

65
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:03,760
nothing but respect for that guy. He's an
awesome human being to you see is just,

66
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:07,510
he's a fantastic guy. Have you ever
thought about fighting heavyweight?

67
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,670
It crossed my mind from time to time,
but I feel I'm, I'm, I'm not done with,

68
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:17,260
and I'm not done in light heavyweight yet.
I have still things to do.
