1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,820
It happens and you complained about
it on Twitter, but I not chasing Jane.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:08,320
Let's talk about change. Did you read
about that girl from Sweden? From Sweden,

3
00:00:08,321 --> 00:00:12,250
maybe who got on the airplane with
the guy who was sent to Afghanistan?

4
00:00:12,251 --> 00:00:15,970
I did read that this morning.
I have never been more,

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:21,430
I think I was being deported and she
knew when he gets back he's going to die.

6
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,990
He's going to be murdered. This guy,
that was her attitude. What is the stuff?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Cause I only read the headline of
it, the whole thing. The whole story.

8
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:31,810
So she's on the plane specifically
bought a ticket knowing that he's being

9
00:00:31,811 --> 00:00:35,200
deported. So she did it on push.
She's an activist. She's an activist,

10
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,000
but I don't know what
she's done in the past.

11
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:42,001
All I know is she refused to sit down
and at a certain point there was a soccer

12
00:00:43,481 --> 00:00:45,220
team on the flight,
stood up with her.

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,710
There were other people
who said we back you.

14
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,910
But there were also a lot of
pieces of shit. Shut down.

15
00:00:51,911 --> 00:00:53,230
You're making us late.

16
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,570
So one's going to die and look at
her putting herself on the line.

17
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,500
And then she was,
as she and the guy who was being deported,

18
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,310
we're finally escorted off the plane
because she did her research and her

19
00:01:06,311 --> 00:01:10,690
research told her that the captain can
have them both taken off the plane and

20
00:01:10,691 --> 00:01:11,524
take off anything.

21
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,520
So the, the story was that he was
being deported because of ice.

22
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,590
Is that what it was? I see.
I did. I only read the one.

23
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,830
So he,

24
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,220
they were deporting him and then he was
going to get sent back to Afghanistan

25
00:01:24,221 --> 00:01:28,510
where he was going to be killed.
Yes, we live in a weird time when we

26
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,840
start our story. I was reading about some
woman who was devastated because her,

27
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:35,674
um,

28
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:40,210
her daughter in law was being deported
and choose a Trump supporter and her

29
00:01:40,211 --> 00:01:43,600
daughter in law has been
in the United States, uh,

30
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:48,160
her whole life and, uh, being
deported and you know, just couldn't,

31
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,860
couldn't believe it, couldn't, you
know, came over here as an infant,

32
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,610
that kind of thing that when you're an
illegal alien that no one gives a fuck.

33
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:57,740
Have you been here for 30 years? You
only been alive for 32 they don't get it.

34
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,440
You get sent back and that's, that's
a disgrace. It really is a disgrace.

35
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,280
No, it's a horrible, it's a horrible
thing. And people like, well,

36
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:09,000
why don't you fucking drug Aisha,
this young girl, young girl,

37
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,570
but believing so strongly
that she bought a ticket,

38
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,460
got on the plane and then wouldn't
sit down. But what happens now though?

39
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,790
What if the guy's still gets sent back
and kill? But she still, she, she do.

40
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:26,220
She had something. She did something
and maybe you won't. You don't know.

41
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,880
But that's more than just her
putting on her Twitter account.

42
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,470
This is not right being deported.
This is the one actually doing something,

43
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,610
doing something that doesn't
injure somebody else.

44
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,420
And it can inconvenience as people,
but nothing more than that.

45
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,590
What if you had a layer with though?
He had a big gig. What have I had?

46
00:02:45,591 --> 00:02:48,030
A layover was a huge grandma.
I'm on her side.

47
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,600
I know that from the gift of this
sold out crowd. No, I don't care.
