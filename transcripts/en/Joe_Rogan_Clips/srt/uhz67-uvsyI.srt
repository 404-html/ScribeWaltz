1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,990
The joe rogan experience.
You know, it's funny.

2
00:00:03,991 --> 00:00:08,991
In 1985 I lived in a building in Fort
Lee and there was a Panamanian woman and

3
00:00:09,211 --> 00:00:14,211
she told me that she went to Cuba twice
as a young girl and she wasn't surprised

4
00:00:14,491 --> 00:00:18,660
what was going on in Cuba. That
was God's punishment. She goes,

5
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:21,570
it was such a disgusting fucking place.

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,670
And then it was weird. A couple
of days after, I'm talking to Tj,

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,070
uh,
somebody on Facebook.

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,930
I did a joke from my CSO special about
club 38 the owner name was Willie Vandy.

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,070
And his claim to fame was that his
grandfather had the biggest dick in Cuba.

10
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,670
I grew up with two kids that had
a claim to fame. One of them,

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,020
his dad was the best pool player in
Cuba and Americans will go down and he'd

12
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:48,080
beat the fuck out of him and pull you,

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,740
but they played Chicago eight ball
when I'm in Chicago. The other guy,

14
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:57,480
his claim to fame was that his grandfather
was the guy in godfather two who had

15
00:00:57,481 --> 00:01:02,481
the big Dick and they called him superman
and Saturday nights at club 38 in

16
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:04,591
union city,

17
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:09,591
he would on Saturdays he recreated and
he's had people come down and it'd be

18
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:14,640
like a comedy show, $10 ticket and 200
people. He would get some coke out,

19
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:19,050
chick tire up to Cubans like that would
play the congress and he'd come out and

20
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:20,280
fuck the lady in public,

21
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:25,690
just go crazy with the biggest dick in
the world and my job fucker and public.

22
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:29,580
That was a whole thing. That was the
whole thing. That was a public fuck show,

23
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:34,581
but it went all the way back to Cuba to
like 55 like the name of the place was

24
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,110
the Shanghai,

25
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,820
the Shanghai Theater and and then
then godfather to Michael takes,

26
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:43,800
they take Michael there and
all of a sudden he goes,

27
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:47,460
I would have never found this place if
it wasn't for Johnny Ola and that's when

28
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:51,540
Michael finds out that he betrayed
them so they don't show the guys pick.

29
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,770
Then simpler if the guy with the big
Dick was also the greatest pool player

30
00:01:55,771 --> 00:01:58,710
because he could just, Oh my God.
Yeah, that would have been perfect.

31
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,800
So they did this article
about two weeks ago.

32
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:05,820
It's on my Facebook and it's called
in search of Superman, Joe Rogan.

33
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,880
It was the most disgusting article I had
ever read in my life that these white

34
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:16,221
dudes went on a 50 year
looking for superman and the
legend of the guy with the

35
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:21,030
big thick. In fact, do val
went to Cuba to the location,

36
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,500
even though it's close,

37
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:28,010
just to see where it was and what the
story is that us as Americans will go down

38
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:32,880
there every week and that was our first
time to see this big black Cuban dude.

39
00:02:32,881 --> 00:02:37,070
Fuck the shit out of some poor white
chick, you know, yelling and screaming.

40
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,830
The place was sold out every night.
I mean, the guy was a gardener.

41
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,890
The article is sensational, or if you
could find it, it's called in search.

42
00:02:44,891 --> 00:02:49,850
You're superman and they is it there?
The Superman of a vagina.

43
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,200
But when it came out the same
week that they said that,

44
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,820
what are you fucking crazy?
They ain't no fake. That's real.

45
00:02:56,821 --> 00:03:00,130
That's why they call him superman.
Afraid know. I saw, I saw

46
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,060
a video of Superman when I was
researching Havana Nocturne.

47
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,650
I found out that Santo traffic content
had a lawyer named Sam Rogano since

48
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:11,584
deceased,

49
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:16,090
but Sam Ogana used to take a lot of super
eight videos when he'd go down to Cuba.

50
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,253
His son,

51
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,260
who's currently a a lawyer in Tampa told
me that he had super eight footage of

52
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:27,961
superman that his father had made in
the 50s superman at a private sex show.

53
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:33,070
Fucking a girl. And I said, Ooh, I got
to see that. Could I see that? I mean,

54
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:37,180
I think that's the only existing
video footage anywhere of Superman.

55
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,700
And he said, yeah, but I'm
not going to give it up.

56
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,900
You got to come to Tampa and I'll
show it for you. So I go down there,

57
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,060
I'll never forget,
he's a lawyer too.

58
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:49,870
He says he got to come at six o'clock
after the, after the office closes.

59
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,730
So then we can watch it. And I get
there and the cleaning lady still there,

60
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,660
so he brings me into a conference room
where he's going to show me the film and

61
00:03:57,661 --> 00:04:01,000
we got to sit there and wait until the
cleaning lady's done because he didn't

62
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:02,570
want to put this film
on while the Clinton,

63
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,000
while the cleaning ladies in the room,

64
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,600
so he puts it on the plates to office
is completely empty and he shows me this

65
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:14,911
footage and his father had scored it to
like Wagner or Beethoven like triumph

66
00:04:15,871 --> 00:04:20,710
and classical music and it's, it's at a
private show. It's in somebody's home.

67
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,640
They had private sex salons in Havana
where you'd go to like some rich person's

68
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:26,560
house,
you'd pay some money,

69
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,870
you had cocktails and then someone had
clap at a certain time and you knew that

70
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:35,320
was time for the show and everyone would
sit down and superman would come out

71
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,720
and he, he, he fucked this. A
Cuban woman who was, who was small,

72
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:45,721
he was big and she was small and he's
banging her from every conceivable angle.

73
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,540
It was the least sexy thing you've
ever seen in your life. I mean,

74
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:53,680
it looked like a, it looked like
some kind of torture really.

75
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,190
Uh, and that was it. And
this guy had this footage,

76
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:02,410
which is probably worth a lot of models.
Big was the Dick. The Dick was big.

77
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:09,970
It wasn't, no, I say that because
it wasn't like I wasn't the,

78
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,580
I'm not sure it was even the
biggest stick I've ever seen.

79
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,070
I mean it was bigger than
my dad's bigger than normal.

80
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:18,610
It was bigger than the guys today.
It's almost like athletes.

81
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,300
Like if you go back and look at, you
know, when Jim Brown was playing football,

82
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:25,360
he was very impressive. But was he
Herschel Walker? You know what I'm saying?

83
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,480
Like athletes of today's era or different,

84
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,390
and if you go back and look at John
Holmes, yeah, he had a big Dick,

85
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:36,010
but was it Lexington steel? You know,
like these guys have bigger dicks now,

86
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,850
but the people are that they're
board vex people are growing.

87
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:44,140
The thing that freaked me out of the
human feces is advancing dancing.

88
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,200
But then that frequent about Santo that
I enjoyed from your first book of analog

89
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,170
turn. And I wanted to tell Joe the stories
that one time Kelly went to cash, uh,

90
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:59,260
Cuba as a senator and they were having
type of meeting but fucking Kennedy can

91
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:04,670
focus bro.
He just like it and that they like,

92
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:07,700
what the fuck is wrong with Monsanto
traffic camping because I know exactly

93
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,660
what's wrong.
Come on.

94
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,690
And they tapped him on the shoulder
and they bring them in the room.

95
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,220
He's embellishing this. Tell me, this
is what I remember. This is better.

96
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,730
This is what I remember I read.
And that I guess sat though,

97
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:23,750
he's sick them on two women
candidate while he set up. He said,

98
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,950
no, they didn't film it. They wish,
they wish they had filmed that.

99
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:31,910
They said they set him up in a room when
the two way mirror and they watched it

100
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:35,120
happening. And then one of them
said, Shit, we should've filmed this.

101
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,440
This would make great blackmail
material. Right. Well,

102
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:43,310
like Santo was kind of a freak.
So JFK cheers.

103
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,680
The freakiest the freaks,
right? Yeah. Well,

104
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,100
but you got to keep in mind he wasn't
married. He was a young senator.

105
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,020
He used to get this senator from Florida
named George Smathers and the two of

106
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:56,060
them would go down to Havana.

107
00:06:56,061 --> 00:07:00,950
And this was around 1955 56 when
the whole thing was in its hay day.

108
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,630
And that was a big part of a van of
politicians and businessmen would go on

109
00:07:05,631 --> 00:07:10,010
junkets to Havana, like you
know, paid for by the company.

110
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,740
Weekend Retreat,
go to Havana,

111
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,660
and they'd go to the Shanghai theater and
they had tris sexual triste and they'd

112
00:07:17,661 --> 00:07:21,680
go crazy. And it was out of sight,
out of mind. It was the original,

113
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:23,810
you know what happens in Havana,
stays in a van.

114
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:26,600
It was all different country wasn't
going to make the newspapers.

115
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,370
So they go there and they rub elbows with
Santo traffic contact in Meyer Lansky

116
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,490
and they loved it. It was
exciting. It wouldn't,

117
00:07:34,491 --> 00:07:37,040
it wouldn't do them any damage back home.
You know?

118
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:41,180
Amazing. When my mother
died in [inaudible] 79 and
whenever I did something,

119
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:46,520
like if I call my head differently
or if I wore like a, an orange shirt,

120
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:50,450
my mom would go, what are you
fucking rock Hudson? And I go,

121
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:52,890
what the fuck are you talking
about? Rock Hudson, you know,

122
00:07:52,891 --> 00:07:55,760
and then one day I asked like, why do
you always call me and rock cuts him?

123
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,520
And she goes, cause rock Hudson,
I don't money go. And I go,

124
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:00,980
what the fuck are you talking about?

125
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:06,820
She told me she died in [inaudible] 79
my mom told me in 1978 flat out to my

126
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:11,960
face that fucking he was gay as could
be. And I'm like, you don't want,

127
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,250
I've heard I'm sick and tired of
you fucking Cubans. Because Cubans,

128
00:08:16,251 --> 00:08:19,070
like they used to tell me when I was a
kid that they smacked Bruce Lee and Cuba

129
00:08:19,071 --> 00:08:21,290
one time that he went down
there and talking to shit.

130
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,320
And one of my uncles smack them
in the face that, you know,

131
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,050
Cubans will lie to you just
to fucking fuck with you.

132
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,740
So I thought my mother was fucking
with me. She's like a rock concert.

133
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:34,840
Is this gay? Here's a $3 bill. And I
go, what the fuck are you talking about?

134
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,460
She goes, let me do what I'm talking
about. Right when I was a little girl,

135
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,490
rock cuts and would come to Cuba
and we would all go to the hotel.

136
00:08:40,491 --> 00:08:43,650
You like when Michael Jackson goes to
a hotel, come outside and they clap.

137
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,740
He shook the kid outside the window.

138
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,390
We would be out there like
waiting to see rock cuts,

139
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,550
but the hotel guy would tell us he was
up there in a room with a man and I would

140
00:08:52,551 --> 00:08:55,770
go, Ma, are you fucking crazy?
Like I didn't believe her.

141
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,610
My mother died in [inaudible] 79 85
rock Hudson comes on and says he's gay.

142
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,650
Like Campbell was just a hiding place for
people that want your mother know that

143
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,630
the Marlon Brando was
fucking Richard Pryor.

144
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,050
No one time found out from this article,

145
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,290
if we were to scroll down a little bit,
it says it,

146
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:17,400
that they asked his neighbors and the
neighbors were like, no, he was bisexual.

147
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,560
And then when his number one guy that
was known every time he came to Cuba was

148
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:23,430
Marlon Brando,

149
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:27,270
he was Marlon Brando would walking there
with to show girls and then him and

150
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:29,430
fucking superman would
leave by themselves.

151
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,400
So while Brando loved the music,

152
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:37,590
they play Congos all that shit.
He was really into it. Well,

153
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,600
Pryor's wife was saying that back then,
they were doing so much coke did.

154
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:44,040
Everybody just fucked everybody.
Everybody. That's just so crazy.

155
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,660
He couldn't make Jagger.
Fuck somebody like David Garrison.

156
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,900
That was one of Mick Jagger.

157
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:52,650
His wife said she caught David
Bowie and bed with Mick Jagger.

158
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,630
I know a lot of coke, but I never
wanted to fuck you up the ass Joe Rogan.

159
00:09:55,631 --> 00:09:57,540
You know what I'm saying? Like
I never, I did a lot of coke.

160
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,180
I never want to fuck
another guy in the story.

161
00:10:00,181 --> 00:10:03,990
Brando who was bisexual took off
with superman, ditching the dancers.

162
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,990
So Superman was a bisexual too.
In fact,

163
00:10:06,991 --> 00:10:10,530
I heard he had died of
gangrene. Gangrene. Yeah.

164
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:15,480
And here it says that he infected.
Yeah. He died with a lover from sex.

165
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,510
Oh,
he slept around but gangrene from Sachs.

166
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,900
How hard you got to fuck
to get gang green maybe.

167
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:26,900
Fuck this chick that got shot in the ass.
He might've fucked animals.

168
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:32,700
Yeah. Wow. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. Was getting dirty,

169
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:35,010
Bro. Cuba was dirty. It was dirty.

170
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:43,310
Okay.
