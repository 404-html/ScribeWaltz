1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,700
You're not going to get a chance to see
the future. Once you're reborn again.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,640
They, this life, when you come back, do
you want to have a memory of your past?

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,780
You don't, you don't get think it's
a part of the system I think. Yeah,

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,910
I think it's evil either whether
it's voluntary or involuntary.

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,230
It's best to not know where
you came from at first.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,480
It's best to figure it out.

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,810
That's probably what this is
all about is figuring it out.

8
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:25,500
Cause when we go to the movie, part
of it is, it's all about the journey.

9
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:28,110
It's not about the destination.
People always use that as a, you know,

10
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:31,230
an Instagram. It's not about the journey.
And so it's not about the destination.

11
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:31,980
It's the journey.

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,640
That's one of the most popular saying
it's Everett and it's beautiful.

13
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:38,690
You have to say it every now and then
to remind you, remind the rum. Well My,

14
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,190
another thing to remind you, you don't
even think about it as a journey.

15
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,180
Just be in the moment except the moment
and be in the moment. Live in the moment.

16
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,410
Think about the future plan for the
future. But exist in the moment. You know,

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,670
don't think of it as a
journey or a destination,

18
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:53,670
but the people that are the most fucked
or the people that are trying to make it

19
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,790
one day I'm going to make it. And
then when you make, there's no making.

20
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,650
It never happens. So it
doesn't, it doesn't change.

21
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:03,270
It doesn't matter if you're an illusion.
I fell for it. Hook, line and sinker.

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,960
Oh my God. The wanting to be
a rock star my whole life.

23
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,490
They got me good. I wanted that man
shit. Oh, I was going to have that man.

24
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:14,370
She just filled, you know, with
the shakes and then go back.

25
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:19,110
So that's what I was after my whole life.
They got me good.

26
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:24,090
When I saw kiss and I saw that shit, I'm
like, I want that. I knew, right, right.

27
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:27,960
When I saw kiss meets the
phantom of the park, 1978 on NBC,

28
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,240
one of the worst movies of all time.

29
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,880
It just blew me the fuck away.
There was a power outage.

30
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:38,820
All my God, I was watching it at home.
The power went out and I was devastated.

31
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,440
The weird thing about that, that arrows
in 1978 and if you followed kiss,

32
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:47,350
if you were old and I was eight and if
you follow a kiss from 73 [inaudible]

33
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:52,550
they already had their early cool years
and then after kiss alive that a few

34
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:56,280
more awesome albums and then they got
to the point where they started doing

35
00:01:56,281 --> 00:02:00,720
disco and that was 1978 that's when I
got into them when they started doing

36
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:03,030
disco. So I didn't, I didn't
even know what selling out was.

37
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:05,820
I just heard I was made for loving
it. I loved it. You know what I mean?

38
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:10,650
I had no idea. But um, man, I don't
even know what my fucking point was.

39
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:12,660
What were we talking about?
I don't remember either.

40
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:15,750
The point was you're never going to
get to know what the future holds.

41
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,170
You just going to be living your life
and that's how it is with everybody.

42
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,870
I don't remember what the fuck your
point was. The Rock Star thing though,

43
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,150
you Roxanne to be a rock star.
They get you. They get, you could,

44
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:31,820
there's so many different ways
they can, like you get your,

45
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,660
you get yourself too. I mean, you gotta,

46
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:36,540
you gotta think about what you're exposed
to, but look, it's like music videos,

47
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:40,180
what they sell in music videos. They sell
that. It's like they're offering book.

48
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,070
I got and, and a lot of those
rappers that are flashing on a cash,

49
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:45,420
it's not even their money. It's
not even there, their mansion.

50
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,100
But it's pushing that,

51
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,620
pushing like you want to do whatever
it takes, whatever it takes to make it.

52
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:57,750
I was so zeroed in on that, you know, me
up, up until up until a few years ago.

53
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,980
How was the zeroed on it? Uh, then I
began to realize, wow, they got me real.

54
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:07,150
God damn good. You know, I was
obsessed with some, some, uh,

55
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:09,340
an illusion.
Fame is an illusion.

56
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,940
Obsessed with the destination
instead of the journey. Right. Well,

57
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:15,640
I enjoyed the journey, but it was like,
no, I'm saying that you're obsessed with,

58
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:19,780
it was all about conquering the music
business. That's all it was about.

59
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,600
And it's not about that
anymore, obviously. Thank God,

60
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,810
thank God I sucked musically because if
I would've had a record deal and my 20s

61
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,400
shit, I would have did some
crazy illuminati shit back then.

62
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,320
I would've did whatever
I should like whatever.

63
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:35,950
Just I would have been to those parties
with the crazy mask and been doing.

64
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,840
I'm like, let's go have parties
with a crazy man. I was like, shut.

65
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,680
They just let you, the guidewire hit
album, they're like, Hey Eddie, they

66
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,980
come off California.
Come on down.

67
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:50,500
Thank God my music sucked because I would
have went along with all that shit in

68
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:51,880
my twenties I was so obsessed.

69
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,790
I was so obsessed with making
it in the music business.

70
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,530
I would have did any of the home,
but you wouldn't have done that.

71
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,770
Gone part of the Jimmy Savile.

72
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,700
I would have been hanging out
with whoever was famous, you know?

73
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,651
Well,
you know,

74
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:08,860
it's like retirement is a lesser example
that people are always looking for

75
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:09,880
those golden years.

76
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,150
One day I'm going to retire and we're
going to be working with our hands at the

77
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:18,100
sunset. Like, no, you're thinking
about death then don't do shit anymore.

78
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,660
And you don't have nothing to do.
You know,

79
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:22,360
the only time you should think about
retirement is if you have a job that you

80
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:24,070
can retire and they pay you still,

81
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,170
and then you can go do
whatever the fuck you want.

82
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:27,590
That's what you should be
thinking about retiring.

83
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,160
But thinking about as this time
where high to leave, we get to relax.

84
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,960
We put our feet up and then they turn
you into soylent green, turn you a foot.

85
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,260
That's what we're really aiming for.
