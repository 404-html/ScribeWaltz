1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,760
You drive in in Australia? No,
no bill. Just so seeing the,

2
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:08,100
I was just saying that with the
site, it was just so weird, you know,

3
00:00:08,101 --> 00:00:10,020
just everything was so awkward
and immune was Craig. We went,

4
00:00:10,021 --> 00:00:14,010
I went for a run and they're freaking
parrots and like anger Rusi Shit Dude.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,560
Like just regular like it's like our
seagulls and crows. I'm like Ryan,

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,850
cause like rainbows,
like two can't stand next to me.

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,060
Australia is a weird place man.
Yeah, it was. It was crazy bike.

8
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:25,230
My time clock was screwed up.

9
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:28,920
I went to work a couple a couple of days
later and like Mao was still like 40

10
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:32,110
later and I was still like
messed up. It was bad. Yeah.

11
00:00:32,111 --> 00:00:35,010
I could fuck you up for a week or two,
but you know,

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,420
it's worth it just to go to Australia.
Amazing. It's a great place. Yeah.

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,253
I have a bunch of family there.

14
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,050
When you have a big fight with a guy
like saint Mark Hunt, well, you know,

15
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:46,080
could be a brawl and that turned
out to be a five round fight. Right.

16
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,970
Was it a fair four and a half? Yeah,
he stopped him in the fifth. Yep. Um,

17
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,180
when you, you have a fight
like that and you know this is,

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,440
you're in there for the long haul.

19
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:59,700
Do you plan on like staying for
days after the fight to recover?

20
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,330
No, I actually wanted him
to get home but I had,

21
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:08,650
I was a bad boy so he wanted me to do a
couple like promotional thing went down

22
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,230
here. They put, they get to see my family.

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,390
So I have family Australia
other than Melbourne and Sydney.

24
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,430
Oh you have family out
there. Oh no kidding. Yeah.

25
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:16,050
So we hung out with for a little bit.
It was cool.

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,610
Did you see that video that they posted
a yesterday of these guys in Australia

27
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:24,420
with a 39 foot boat and the
sharks went by those 20 feet long.

28
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:25,853
You see that video?

29
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,890
It's fucking insane video cause the shark
is almost as big as the God damn boat.

30
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,830
They have this 39 foot boat
and they have an overhead,

31
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:39,760
like a drone footage of the
sharks swimming around the
boat. And I like cheese.

32
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,430
I definitely shit my pants and that
one, it was not much you can do. I mean,

33
00:01:44,431 --> 00:01:48,570
you don't have a whole lot of options.
Yeah. Wow. It's like 20 foot shark.

34
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,080
That's crazy. Fuck all that. And
that. Australia has a ton of those.

35
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:55,410
They're all over the place. Yeah. I mean
I, I was talking, math happens a lot.

36
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:59,510
Apparently. 18 foot shirt
next to a 21 foot boat. Oh

37
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,290
fuck that dude.
Oh my gosh.

38
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,850
Those videos like those whales and stuff
that sprout up. Yeah. Whoa. You know,

39
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:10,440
like right next to the boat.
Yeah. What does this one Jamie,

40
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,250

boat. Oh my God. That thing is big.

41
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:20,660
Jesus Christ. It's huge. And it's
just swimming next to the boat going,

42
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,870
can I eat you? Hmm? How do I eat
you? I'm not sure if I can eat you.

43
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,970
God Damn Kid. Get back, get back and
was your son get back? You little fuck.

44
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,830
Sit down. Jesus Christ.
It's a shark. Yeah,

45
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:35,803
they're there.

46
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,590
Did you see the video of

recent video and I like hit
