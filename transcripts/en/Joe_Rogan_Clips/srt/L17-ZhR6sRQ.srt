1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,310
The joe rogan experience. So, okay.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,110
I know a bunch of my u s team members
are going to shoot me in the face for

3
00:00:08,111 --> 00:00:11,800
tough talking about this
because in the face, yeah,

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,920
literally in the face because one thing
that was an ongoing thing for when I was

5
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:20,020
on the u s team,
we,

6
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:25,090
there was this thing that went on about
how long we could go at a tournament

7
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:28,210
before we talked about
this particular person.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,260
So during my time on the teams,

9
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:36,730
we actually had a person that was,

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,660
um,

11
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:42,430
she claimed to have a medical disorder
or she didn't actually claim to have it,

12
00:00:42,431 --> 00:00:44,110
but supposedly it happens.

13
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:49,000
But she claimed to have a disorder
where she had attachment to items.

14
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,160
This girl that was on my team actually
ended up marrying the Eiffel Tower.

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,220
Are you serious? I'm not kidding. She
went and she had an attachment to,

16
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:01,973
yes.

17
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,220
She actually filed some claims against,

18
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:12,930
supposedly filed some claims against
a bow company that this boat company

19
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:18,631
actually had a rubber laminate
on the limbs of the bow and

20
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:25,280
Mary's, I feel cow. Is that her?

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,470
Wow.

22
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,070
Oh, she mad. Harris is famous
monument. I wrote a mini buses with,

23
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,610
you've worked with her. I uh, oh my God.

24
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,030
She's a former soldier who
lives in San Francisco.

25
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:40,860
She has been in love
with the objects before.

26
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,520
Their first infatuation was with lance,

27
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,730
a bow that helped her become
a world class. Our chair,

28
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,940
she is fond of the Berlin Wall and she
claims to have a physical relationship

29
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,570
with a piece of fence.
She keeps in her bedroom and the

30
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,420
fuck. Why? What are we doing?

31
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,940
People we can't.

32
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,940
We can't do this.

33
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,440
We've gotten too crazy.
We got to pull back.

34
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:15,350
We got to pull back. Here's the
thing, Mary. A fucking bridge.

35
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:19,590
Just pitch. Married a bridge. She married
a Brooklyn. She married the Eiffel Tower.

36
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,090
This bitch is marrying a bridge
though. Just kissing. Kissing bridges.

37
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,220
Parts of being in love
with a public object. Yeah.

38
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,310
What the fuck does she just say?
[inaudible] love of the public object.

39
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,430
Crank that up.
I want to hear this crazy lady.

40
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,910
I feel very, very blessed to have a
piece of my sweet Golden Gate Bridge.

41
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,880
Oh, Jesus stopped. I
give up. I'm out my home.

42
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:51,640
You there as long as I could
love with the bridge. Hey,

43
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,080
now, meanwhile your dad, wait, wait.

44
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,050
In the middle of all this,

45
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,560
there's a lot of people like me that
I've shot tens and tens and tens of

46
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,790
thousands of arrows trying to
win a metal for the country.

47
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,510
But that's different. You're chasing
an accomplishment. The bridge. Yeah,

48
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,350
they just trying to fuck.
Meanwhile, she's on our team bus.

49
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,750
She literally,

50
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:23,770
she slept with her bow one night edit at
an event and then got an infection from

51
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,640
the silicone on the limbs and the
rest of the team had to deal with this

52
00:03:31,531 --> 00:03:34,380
problem. Um, when you say infection,

53
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,510
I don't know where the infection
was, but I have met Elle. Oh No.

54
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,330
I had on a step away from it,

55
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,270
but hey, how good was she as an RJ? Me,

56
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,360
this is pretty rare.
He's actually like gloves.

57
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:57,160
This son of a bitch. Um, how
good was, she has an archer.

58
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,000
She must have been very good.
She's on a team, right? Oh,

59
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,160
putting the hat on the bow. Not a good
sign actually look like potholder.

60
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,930
But she must have been like a
worldclass archer. Right? Don't do it.

61
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:15,130
Don't do it to me. John
does. I would say decent.

62
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:20,590
Good Archer. Danger decent.
Here's, here's the thing.

63
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,270
Okay, so she married the Eiffel
Tower. How'd that work out?

64
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,100
I think she's still married to it.
Friends. People were pissed. This is true.

65
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,900
This is 100% true.

66
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,480
French people are pissed because
American just goes over there,

67
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,200
gets his fiance visa,
marries a tower. Right?

68
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,940
So now we've got a dual citizenship.
Meanwhile,

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,930
she's got this thing for
the Berlin Wall. Yeah. Okay.

70
00:04:50,931 --> 00:04:53,180
Well, the Berlin Wall is
a flirt, first of all.

71
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:58,390
So what Berlin Wall is always like being
real sween giving you this extra long

72
00:04:58,911 --> 00:05:02,750
hugs.
The Berlin Wall in asked for it.

73
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,500
Jamie can not, of course, she's,
she's in love with the Berlin Wall.

74
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:11,300
Who's got how you got married?
She's married to Eiffel
though. So here's the deal.
