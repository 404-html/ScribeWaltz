1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,380
But this is the thought process behind
it and there's no pushback because the

2
00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:08,580
public speaks and then I pushed back in
the attack me and they attack you bring

3
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:09,090
it on,

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,590
bring it on because ignorance bounces
off me like personal hygiene from Michael

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,850
Moore. It just has no impact
whatsoever. I think he washes.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,360
You don't think I have a shame like
a more, you know what a what a swine.

7
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:25,020
He is as a subhuman Mongrel. If I borrow,
when I met him, he was in his car.

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,060
He's a prick.
He's a liar.

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,000
What do you think he's like scam
artists like gun control. Well,

10
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:32,150
how about the fact that
he put together that move,

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,880
that so called documentary that Hollywood
actually give him an award and he

12
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:39,810
copied and pasted out of
sequence the attack on the grid.

13
00:00:39,811 --> 00:00:44,400
Charlton Heston claiming he was somehow
responsible for the little child killing

14
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:49,200
herself with you're paroled felon father's
gun and they put it out of sequence

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,320
and attributed Charlton Heston defending
such irresponsible gun ownership.

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,360
Michael Moore is a line,
cruel,

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,390
stoned punk cause he's don't
constantly all day all the time.

18
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,050
I think he uses depositories.
I don't know him.

19
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,000
I do and I, he's a punk. Have you
ever had a conversation? Yeah. Yeah.

20
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:15,390
I was on his TV show and I was responsible
for ending his TV show cause he tried

21
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:16,950
to fuck with me.
And I don't know if you'd noticed Joe,

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,450
but I'm unfuckable you fuck with me.
I'll eat your family tree and shit.

23
00:01:21,451 --> 00:01:24,690
Saw dust into your face.
Ask Pierce Morgan.

24
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,750
That seems like I saw your compensation.
Not even close.

25
00:01:27,751 --> 00:01:30,990
I was arm wrestling a torso.
Well the Pierce Morgan,

26
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:33,960
the problem is he didn't understand the
facts. When you talk about gun violence,

27
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:38,890
he didn't understand that. How much of a
guy he knew them he avoided. Absolutely.

28
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,120
Plus he explain what we're talking about
because when you say the numbers of gun

29
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:45,090
violence,
the a giant percentage of 'em are suicide.

30
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,500
A giant percentage of them are cops
killing bad guys and citizens defending

31
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:51,930
their family.
So all of those are out of the,

32
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:55,080
and then accidental gun deaths,
mass summarize it for you.

33
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,500
So Pierce Morgan fancies himself a conky
rather witty limeys you got the accent

34
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:04,950
and everything. It's funny that actually
an accent, it's an impediment. But, uh,

35
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:08,280
he came out and of course he's going
to take on the motor city madman.

36
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:09,540
I mean this guy is going to be easy.

37
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:14,340
Pickins he actually wrote Wango tango
be all intellectually this thing you're

38
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:15,174
doing.

39
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:20,950
That's the Limey Eve God manufactured
confidence based on nothing except an ego

40
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:28,440
that has no foundation in fact. So
Pierce Morgan, the CNN exec. So,

41
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,650
but it's put Pierce Morgan
on the Motor City Madman.

42
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:36,150
This will be in a gun store to at the
first time you didn't see the first one at

43
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:39,870
the CNN officers. That's the best. Both
of them. Yeah, that's the best one.

44
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,800
And so they think I'm a dirt bag and
then a goof ball because I not only wrote

45
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:50,970
Wang Dang sweet poon Tang, I meant
it. Um, but when they take me on,

46
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,780
they don't realize I never went to college
because I was too busy learning shit.

47
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,860
And if you take me on,
on any subject that I am even slightly of,

48
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,780
I will fuck you up because
I've studied this stuff.

49
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,560
I live this stuff.
I've been with guns since I could walk.

50
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,830
I have had universal unlimited
access to firepower my whole life,

51
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,280
both in a recreational,
a disciplined,

52
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,340
a law enforcement,
military training,

53
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,310
and just a family plinking competition.

54
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,400
So when every considerable,
uh,

55
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,770
imaginable gun use,

56
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,060
I've been 68 years of it.
Um,

57
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:39,150
so they sick Pierce Morgan Ami to teach
me a lesson about how irresponsible gun

58
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:43,840
owners are and that if we could just band
guns, that all the violence would end.

59
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,580
And of course, uh, if you haven't seen
it, you got to Google it because it was,

60
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,300
what's his take? Well,
I almost fixed him, um,

61
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,361
because I,

62
00:03:54,361 --> 00:03:58,750
I so overwhelmed them with evidence that
they finally research and realize that

63
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:01,570
every word out of my mouth
was absolutely indisputable.

64
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:03,400
What was most compelling
that you were saying to him?

65
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,760
I'll summarize it as this way like I did
to pierce the anti gunners have their

66
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:10,750
dream.
It exists.

67
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,090
It existed in Paris where all those
people were shot with collision kickoffs,

68
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:21,160
collision concert band. They have their
dream Pierce Morgans dream exists.

69
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:25,930
It's called a gun free zone.
Virginia Tech, Columbine,

70
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,160
Sandy Hook,
Aurora Parklin.

71
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,880
Every instance where the most innocent
lives have been slaughtered have been in

72
00:04:36,271 --> 00:04:40,300
Nancy Pelosi, Maxine waters, Eric Holder,

73
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,790
Hillary Clinton,
Barack Obama's dream.

74
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,450
Their dream is a gun free zone,

75
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,090
but we're three people are forced,

76
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,240
forced into unarmed helplessness where
the most innocent lives are lost and that

77
00:04:55,271 --> 00:05:00,271
dream has produced more carnage and
destroyed lives than anything in the world

78
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,900
compared to the NRA convention where
you have the highest incidence of gun

79
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:08,530
ownership or opening day of deer season
in Michigan where you have 100% gun

80
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:11,020
ownership and access
where nobody gets hurt.

81
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,160
So if you know that your dream is a
gun free zone and that's where the most

82
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:16,330
innocent lives are lost,

83
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:21,510
what kind of demonic dirt
bag would actually want more?

84
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:22,961
Well,

85
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:26,650
let me stop gun Fritz and I stopped his
position or anybody's position on the

86
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:27,410
other side.

87
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,930
You would say the real gun free zone
would be no one having access to the gun

88
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:35,140
that killed those people in the gun
free zone. It's not a gun free zone.

89
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,033
And the real,

90
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,020
and the real answer to drownings in
America would be to ban water fuels.

91
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,890
You work on banning water,

92
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:45,610
I'll work on banning guns and we'll touch
base every few weeks and see how you

93
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:50,230
can not ban. You cannot
eliminate guns. Finland,

94
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,840
you can not eliminate guns.
Uh,

95
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:56,470
Alberta Canada where the guy who came
into the University of shot everybody up.

96
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,980
It's so what you do instead of
thinking you could ban water,

97
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,160
learn to swim and watch
your children by the pool.

98
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,280
Call me weird.

99
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,400
But the way to handle violence is
to carry a gun practice with it.

100
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:17,400
And when someone brings lethal force
against you, shoot the mother fucker.

101
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,680
But people are very uncomfortable with
the idea of an incredibly armed society.

102
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,180
Comfortable babies.
Sorry,

103
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:25,940
you're uncomfortable and go
ahead and bend over and die.

104
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,190
But you know what I'm saying?
Fuck, I know what you're saying.

105
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:31,220
But wouldn't it be better if there
weren't any concern that the,

106
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,990
the idea is to somehow
or another takeaway,

107
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:38,420
the concern of people being shot randomly
by some psycho that you've got to

108
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:41,420
figure out if you get all the guns away,
how do you get all the guns?

109
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,270
We don't know. I don't know. But this is
what I'm saying is that you don't know,

110
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:47,150
so let's just start. If they're
not try, if it's not that,

111
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:49,100
then everybody's got guns to shoot.
Nobody.

112
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:52,600
Everybody will not have guns and
some people have guns. People here.

113
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,740
I studied San Bernardino. I started
to roar. I started at Virginia Tech.

114
00:06:56,741 --> 00:07:00,250
I studied Columbine. I studied
sandy hook. I studied them all.

115
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,630
Do you know Joe and everybody better
write this down because I'm the only guy

116
00:07:04,631 --> 00:07:09,100
that will tell you this. I've studied
the cadence, the bullet manufacturers,

117
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,210
the rate of fire,

118
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,380
the movement of the Perp and
the movement of the victims

119
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,030
in every instance,
including in Connecticut,

120
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,760
including Aurora, including
San Bernardino, right here,

121
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:29,690
there were American citizens who would
have had a gun on their person if they

122
00:07:30,391 --> 00:07:35,391
were allowed to and they could have been
a meaningful force to at least reduce,

123
00:07:35,641 --> 00:07:39,600
if not terminate the violent,
murderous threat.

124
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:44,990
But by law we have been so dumbed
down and so forced against our natural

125
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:53,030
survival instinct to have a tool on our
belt that in every instance where the

126
00:07:54,121 --> 00:07:55,680
most innocent lives were slaughtered,

127
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,970
those people that would have intervened
with a firearm, not many of them,

128
00:07:59,971 --> 00:08:03,450
but there was a janitor, there was a
couple of guys in the office they add,

129
00:08:03,451 --> 00:08:04,470
can see a weapons permit,

130
00:08:04,471 --> 00:08:07,440
but they weren't allowed to have
Monette building in Virginia Tech.

131
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,690
There were guys that had guns,
concealed weapons permits,

132
00:08:09,691 --> 00:08:12,180
but they weren't allowed to have
them there in Aurora, Colorado.

133
00:08:12,181 --> 00:08:13,140
Are you kidding me?

134
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,350
All kinds of people would have had
guns and they could have returned fire,

135
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,780
but they were forced into
unarmed helplessness. Here,

136
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:23,490
here's the gun debate in its
con irrefutable conclusion.

137
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,440
If you are forced into
unarmed helplessness,

138
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,250
you are unarmed and helpless.

139
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,880
What a horrible,
irresponsible,

140
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,970
suicidal condition that Ian,
I'm just a guitar player. Joe.

141
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:45,710
I've never been unarmed since
I graduated from high school.

142
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:51,270
I've always had a Hanky in a pocket full
of guitar picks and a pocket knife and

143
00:08:51,341 --> 00:08:55,560
a belt knife and uh, built tool and
a pistol. And some extra bullets.

144
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,700
I just have them everywhere I go.
I've never been on armed. I find it.

145
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:05,190
How do you travel around? I
improvise, adapt, and overcome.

146
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,670
I luckily I helped pass
house resolution to 18,

147
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:12,270
which means all sworn law enforcement
officer allowed to carry a gun nationwide.

148
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,080
I've been sheriff deputy
since 1984 in my credentials.

149
00:09:16,081 --> 00:09:19,440
Allow me to carry a gun everywhere I go
and I carry a gun everywhere he goes.

150
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,340
In fact, even in England, uh,

151
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,870
American law enforcement are allowed to
carry guns and I carry gun over there.

152
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,610
It's just a tool. If somebody comes
at me, carry a gun in England. Yeah,

153
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:33,420
eat some dirt bag comes at me with
a spiking the, I've just shoot him.

154
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,420
But why not? What's plan B? No, I,

155
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,740
I agreed that I've just had to be hard
to have it and not to need it than to

156
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:44,410
need it and not to happen.
Go.

157
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:48,990
The thing that we would all like
to have is no school shootings,

158
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,640
no mass shootings. Noah roar a no.
Columbine. No. So how do you stop that?

159
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,030
Do you think you stopped that with more
guns when you think you stopped that

160
00:09:57,031 --> 00:10:01,980
with mental health education, figuring
out how to get people off of pills,

161
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,460
figuring out how to keep people from
living despondent lives where they want to

162
00:10:05,461 --> 00:10:09,420
just tear it all down and shoot everybody
in her hurt a bunch of people. Well,

163
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:11,610
here we are. That's the route,
right? Sure. Here we are,

164
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,620
2018 so we can't go back in history in
find the goofball from Virginia Tech and

165
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:19,530
what motivated him?

166
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,750
We can't go back there because we have
failed as a society to take care of

167
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:29,751
people or respond with any sense of
responsibility or effectiveness to the

168
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,430
glaring dangerous sides.

169
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:37,580
Most outrageously in Parkland where
the guy called the cops 42 times,

170
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:43,320
called the FBI three times that guys
are going to shoot up the school. Okay,

171
00:10:43,321 --> 00:10:47,340
we'll make a note of that. No, the guy's
going to shoot up the school. Okay.

172
00:10:47,341 --> 00:10:51,450
We'll make a note of that. The guy is
bringing a gun to school to shoot people.

173
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,310
Here's his manifesto. Uh, we've made a
note of that, but are you kidding me?

174
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:59,700
So now if we go for them to do something
and when someone does something, no,

175
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:04,050
it's not. No, no, it's not. I don't
think it's a failure of law enforcement.

176
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,030
I had, what's the matter? It's just a
shooting two hours ago. Oh Jesus Christ.

177
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:09,541
Another one,

178
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:13,570
five people are dead and multiple people
are wearing apolis Melik Maryland at a

179
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,080
Oh Maryland where no one's
allowed to have a gun, by the way,

180
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:19,890
Marilyn to a newsroom and shot a
bunch of reporters. How much Jesus,

181
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,320
how much you wanna bet
it was a gun free zone.

182
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:26,520
Annapolis newsroom shooting leaves.
Five people dead suspect in custody.

183
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,450
A newsroom. Yeah. Well, what's my point?

184
00:11:30,451 --> 00:11:34,050
So I made a news room and I'm ready to
rock. I'd rather be sitting where you are,

185
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:37,970
but I get figure you've got me covered.
My point is, is that the cat is,

186
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,390
is already out of the bag,
right? It's not too late.

187
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,280
Columbine guys,
glaring signals,

188
00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:50,250
red alarms going off over
at Virginia Tech Guy,

189
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:55,150
red alarms going off for
years and Columbine thing is
a difficult one because it

190
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,000
really hadn't happened before
that no one expected it.

191
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,170
But to parents walked through
the garage for three years.

192
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,380
We're the bomb making materials
were I'm the table. Yeah.

193
00:12:05,381 --> 00:12:08,320
They weren't the best parents
guys were like zombies.

194
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:11,830
These guys were like
doper freaks from buns.

195
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:16,690
I just Zulu land maniacs. Well, he's just,

196
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:19,270
he's just different. No,
he's not. He's freaky.

197
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,700
We need to sit down with this
guy and get him some help.

198
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:23,710
The Aurora guy told his psychiatrist,

199
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:27,030
my goal is to shoot as many people
as possible in the psychiatrist.

200
00:12:27,031 --> 00:12:29,860
Didn't say anything
really or it's on record.

201
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:34,570
He said it in numerous visits with his
psychiatrist that he had threatened his

202
00:12:34,571 --> 00:12:38,800
golden life was to kill as many people
as possible and he's now got his new ar

203
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:41,560
15 to do it with and the
psychiatrist didn't say anything.

204
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:45,790
I've studied this stuff. We need to
not only see something, say something,

205
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,050
we're missing the part.

206
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:52,050
The final part do something when this
kind of abberant threatening violent red

207
00:12:53,711 --> 00:12:55,570
alarm behaviors going off.

208
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:01,050
Inter veen sit down with this kid at the
first instance when your kid comes home

209
00:13:01,421 --> 00:13:06,421
all glassy eyed and goofy
and incommunicable and in
showing weird signs like the

210
00:13:06,581 --> 00:13:11,020
Sandy Hook Guy did all his life and
the Aurora guy did all his life and the

211
00:13:11,021 --> 00:13:15,990
Parkland guys Zombie, you know, staring
like uh, wouldn't blink in a sandstorm.

212
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,650
Somebody got, I know I
would, I mean in my life,

213
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:23,660
whether it's musicians or family members
are going, are you going to write?

214
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,760
What is it going on? You look like
you're going to shit yourself, man.

215
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:28,500
Are you okay?

216
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,990
What do you do with that conversation
with somebody like the psychiatrist did to

217
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:34,930
the Aurora shooter does mean, how
do you fix these people? I mean,

218
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,370
what you're saying is if you have no
gun free zones and people are allowed to

219
00:13:39,371 --> 00:13:41,500
have guns, at least they'll have
an ability to defend themselves.

220
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,660
I agree with you.
I agree with you on that,

221
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,360
but how do you stop it from
happening in the first place?

222
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:50,440
The anti gun people say the way to
stop it is to have no guns available to

223
00:13:50,441 --> 00:13:54,440
civilians that can do things
virtually impossible. A virtual pasta.

224
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,320
So what we're dealing with
is just pragmatically,

225
00:13:56,321 --> 00:14:00,790
when you look at 300 million people
and probably 400 million gun,

226
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:04,050
where you haven't counted mine
yet. I mean, how many guns? Yeah.

227
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,370
For every guy like you that has
hundreds of guns, you know, I am almost,

228
00:14:09,371 --> 00:14:12,430
everybody I know has hundreds
of guns and he just like a man,

229
00:14:12,431 --> 00:14:17,340
I got hundreds of arrows. I have
four, I have dozens of guitars.
