1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,630
Well, it's so clever because
it's so comprehensive.

2
00:00:03,631 --> 00:00:06,570
There's so much involved in it and the
fact that they're willing to do this for

3
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:10,200
years and years before they really sort
of activate the political aspect of what

4
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:12,260
they're trying to do. It also, it's,

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,140
it's strange that they're so sophisticated
about our culture because we don't

6
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:20,490
know a goddamn thing about Russia.
The average person knows Putin, bad,

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,560
evil, warlord, Crimea. He
invade. You know, like we, we,

8
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,130
we have like a four year old's
understanding. Like if you had a,

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,060
if you just grabbed a person,

10
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:33,510
random person that's your college
educated person and ask them to describe

11
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:37,760
what's so bad about Russia. Wow. It's like
communist over there or something. Man,

12
00:00:37,761 --> 00:00:41,770
I'm Elaine [inaudible]. They hate us.
First of all, they have bombs like this.

13
00:00:41,771 --> 00:00:43,920
There's so little
understanding of their culture,

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,950
but yet they know so much about hours.

15
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,640
That's one of the weird things about
being an American. When you go,

16
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,630
when you travel overseas and you realize
how much they know about our elections,

17
00:00:54,631 --> 00:00:55,464
how much they know,

18
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,960
we don't even know who the fuck
there was running their country.

19
00:00:57,961 --> 00:00:59,280
We don't have any idea,

20
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,900
but they know about Trump and they know
that Hillary did this and they know that

21
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:08,750
Bernie wants to give the money away. And
you know, it's, it's crazy. It's, it's,

22
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,720
it's weird.

23
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,670
And these people must have
like a deep education on, uh,

24
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,900
American culture,
American politics and man,

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,500
do you think they're training these kids?
Yeah,

26
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,700
absolutely.
I would.

27
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:23,580
So they did a couple of things that
came out in the Mueller indictment.

28
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,361
First of all,

29
00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:26,880
a couple of people actually came here
and did a road trip around America.

30
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,500
Oh. Literally just to
learn when to Texas. Yeah.

31
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,910
Basically telling me where
you keep the beef jerky

32
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,410
that was in the, uh, one of the, I
think the Mueller indictment of a,

33
00:01:39,411 --> 00:01:42,600
from February 28 teen,

34
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:46,010
there've been three kind of big documents
that have come out to from eastern

35
00:01:46,011 --> 00:01:49,730
district and one from Mueller on,
um, on how, how it all worked out.

36
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,200
I think another misconception is
this notion of $100,000 in ads.

37
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,760
They spent $18 million in 2017,

38
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:01,160
I believe was the stat that came out
during another one of the Mueller

39
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:03,260
indictment's. So they're
not just, you know,

40
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,070
the money's not just going for
the salaries and the ad buys.

41
00:02:06,071 --> 00:02:08,540
The money's also going for.
Um,

42
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:13,310
they were talking about using kind of
consultants and this is where you get at

43
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:16,310
this thing that comes out during the
standup or they're like black people who

44
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:19,490
are LGBT don't want to
see white LGBT memes and,

45
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,750
and this degree of granularity,
that degree of sophistication,

46
00:02:23,751 --> 00:02:27,950
but then also what you see them doing is
engaging one on one and that's where it

47
00:02:27,951 --> 00:02:32,780
crosses the line from social media
operation to this as much more like,

48
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,370
uh, like spying. You want to watch the
Americans? No. Oh, I love that show.

49
00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:39,050
You should definitely go
to that. Great. It's great.

50
00:02:39,051 --> 00:02:43,700
There's too many things to watch. Totally.
But what's interesting is the, um,

51
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,450
it, it does paint a pretty
interesting picture of like this, um,

52
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,740
this couple under deep cover that are
engaging with and pretending to be

53
00:02:51,741 --> 00:02:53,030
Americans and forming relations.

54
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,610
Jen, apparently it's
based loosely. Unreal.

55
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,030
Yeah. That's what I've read
also. But what you see in the,

56
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,490
in the Mueller indictment is the text
messages is the messenger or the Facebook

57
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:07,690
messenger messages where they're going
back and forth with real activists and

58
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:12,400
they're saying things like, um, you
know, hey, my ad account got shut down.

59
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:17,140
Can you run some ads for me?
Or the,

60
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,140
hey, I want to help your protest. Um,

61
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,490
we're fellow black lives matter activists
and we see you're running a protest up

62
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:28,840
and I think it was like Ethica
or something, Binghamton,
how can we help you?

63
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:33,280
We can give you some money for posters
and they're sending money for posters or

64
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:35,770
they reach out to a Trump
supporter and they say like,

65
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,300
we think it'd be really funny to have a
Hillary Clinton impersonators sitting in

66
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:44,400
a truck, flatbed truck that's made
up to look like a jail. Let us, um,

67
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,360
if we give you some money, will you find
the Hillary Clinton impersonator and, um,

68
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,190
put her in jail and do this
Hillary for prison thing.

69
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,700
And so this is where another thing that
they did was using Facebook events to

70
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,660
create real world protests.
So they're not limiting it to shit,

71
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:04,300
posting online and making
people feel tension online.

72
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,920
They're actually sending people out
into the real world to have in street

73
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:09,754
violence.

74
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:14,170
And so one of the things that they did
was they coordinated a Facebook event, um,

75
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,610
one for the Texas secessionist
page and one for the,

76
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,600
there was a pro Muslim called
United Muslims. And on the same day,

77
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,520
at the same time in Texas,
they have a rally to support,

78
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:27,910
um,

79
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:32,910
Texas culture and resist
the Islamicization of Texas
across the street from a

80
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:37,210
rally to defend Muslim
culture. And so they, like,

81
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:38,480
there's literally no,

82
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,910
they just create these Facebook events
on these pages and then they promote them

83
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:45,730
with ad dollars and other
things. And, and you literally,

84
00:04:45,731 --> 00:04:49,310
if you go and you look at the
Texas reporting from that day, um,

85
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,880
I don't remember if it
was dozens or hundreds,

86
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:56,230
but a sufficient number of people showed
up that they had literally on opposite

87
00:04:56,231 --> 00:04:57,250
sides of barricades,

88
00:04:57,251 --> 00:05:01,720
police officers in the center screaming
at each other because one group is there

89
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:05,020
for the resist the Islamicization of
Texas and the other group is there to like

90
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:08,770
defend Muslim culture. And
so you get to, you know,

91
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,920
two opposite sides of the spectrum
in the same place at the same time.

92
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:15,160
And you literally insight like
a mini riot. So they, there,

93
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:18,390
there were about 81 of these
events where they were holding, um,

94
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,920
black lives matter style rallies for
victims of violence, police violence, um,

95
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:28,720
memorials for people who were
killed by police officers. You know,

96
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:31,000
things that real Americans would do.

97
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,580
But this wasn't being done by
real Americans. And that's,

98
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:38,500
that's the insidious thing, right? Is, is
how does, how does Facebook detect that?

99
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:39,334
How to,

100
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:44,730
how to you when you see this come to
defend Texas culture and you're a diehard

101
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:50,210
proud Texan, you know, you're not thinking
like somebody in St Petersburg is, is,

102
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,020
is organizing this.
And that's the, I mean,

103
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,770
I think that the idea that
this was just some memes,

104
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,170
um,
is just not,

105
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:05,270
it doesn't respect the significance
of what they were trying to do and how

106
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:10,670
effective that they were with these
other things where even if they're just

107
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:13,640
trying it out just a little bit,
just working to see what works.

108
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,260
They're always experimenting.

109
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:19,190
They're always trying to find
ways to create that tension. Um,

110
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,430
and that's the thing that I think
is so interesting about this, right?

111
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:26,990
This evolving, this idea of an information
war where these tactics evolve.

112
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,160
Um,

113
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,760
and you are really at a disadvantage
when it comes to actually detecting them.

114
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,430
Yeah. And on the outside, if you're
looking at that, you'd say, well, okay,

115
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,760
what is their objective?

116
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:41,410
Why would they have this Texas a session
as page across or rally across the

117
00:06:41,411 --> 00:06:45,100
street from a pro Islam rally?
Why would they do that? You know,

118
00:06:45,101 --> 00:06:48,210
if you're on the outside you think about
the amount of effort that's involved in

119
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,390
doing something like this. And they are
also doing this with no leaders, right?

120
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:54,640
There's no one there that's
running it when they get there.

121
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,860
So all the pro Texas people go here,
we are looking over there.

122
00:06:58,861 --> 00:07:02,710
So if the mother fucking enemy,
I think

123
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,940
couple times there were comments on some
of the like archived pages and things

124
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,000
where you could see the
screenshots of people being like,

125
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,450
dude you hell it is all come out there.
And like nobody

126
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:19,330
showed up who is in charge. You know,

127
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,270
they're probably throwing a lot of things
against the wall hoping that they set

128
00:07:23,271 --> 00:07:23,630
it up.
It's on something

129
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,940
stacks.
Will you see this on the,

130
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:30,340
there was a page called black matters
and black matters was interesting cause

131
00:07:30,341 --> 00:07:33,640
they went and made a whole website.
So they made a website. Black matters,

132
00:07:33,641 --> 00:07:37,960
you ask.com which I think is still active.
It's dormant.

133
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:40,630
They're not updating it,
but I believe you can go and read it.

134
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,220
And it was designed to call attention
to police brutality type things.

135
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,680
And so they had this
black men or is us page.

136
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,680
And then there's the black matters
Facebook page, the Twitter account,

137
00:07:50,681 --> 00:07:54,370
the Instagram page, the youtube
channel, the soundcloud podcast,

138
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,030
the tumbler,
the spacebook stickers.

139
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,720
They had Facebook stickers that look like
little black panthers. Like little, um,

140
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,870
little cats. Yeah, a little black
cats. They were actually really cute,

141
00:08:04,871 --> 00:08:06,520
very well done.
Um,

142
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,690
so you have this entire fake media
ecosystem that they've just created out of

143
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:11,920
whole cloth,
all theirs.

144
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,900
And then what they start to do is they
start to put up job ads and so it's

145
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:21,901
Cumbia designer for us come be a come

146
00:08:22,631 --> 00:08:26,770
come. Um, you know, they
have like a kind of like, um,

147
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,710
black guy dressed in a cool
outfit like hipster, you know,

148
00:08:29,711 --> 00:08:32,050
holding a sign like join black matters.
Um,

149
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,900
you see them go through a couple of
different logos the same way you would if

150
00:08:34,901 --> 00:08:37,400
you were starting a media brand.
Um,

151
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,260
they start posting ads for,
do you want to be a calendar girl?

152
00:08:41,261 --> 00:08:45,110
Send us your photos on, do you want
to be on a black reality TV show?

153
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:47,770
Send us video clips of you.
Um,

154
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:53,190
do you like they begin to do real
work to ingratiate themselves with the

155
00:08:54,371 --> 00:08:56,370
community that a physical fitness thing.

156
00:08:56,371 --> 00:09:00,570
It was called black fest and
the idea was that it was, um,

157
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,290
kind of vaguely militant desk,
um,

158
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,760
in that it was supposed to teach a
black people how to handle themselves at

159
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,430
protests, should there be police
violence, how to fight back.

160
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,980
And they actually went and found a guy,

161
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:18,090
a physical fitness martial arts guy,

162
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,970
and they were paying
him via paypal. So, so,

163
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,890
so he was running classes for the black
community under this black fist, um,

164
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,370
brand. And they would like
text him or call him. He,

165
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,150
he played some of the voicemails
on TV. Actually I heard them, um,

166
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,370
after my report came out,
I think they tracked him down and um,

167
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,640
and he just talks about how they,
yeah, they just pay pal them, you know,

168
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:43,560
a couple hundred bucks every
time you ran a fitness class,

169
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,530
what was the voicemails
like? It was, I'm a little

170
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,550
concerned the police say you'd,
you'd be,

171
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,800
you'd be surprised they actually had a
youtube channel with two black men named

172
00:09:55,801 --> 00:10:00,720
Williams and Calvin and there was this
channel Williams and Calvin and actual

173
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:04,280
book actual yeah, they
hire these guys, um,

174
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,540
to be a fake youtube
channel. Um, and it was a,

175
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,300
it was called a word of truth,
I think was what the name of it.

176
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:15,480
And so Williams and Calvin
and these two guys would, um,

177
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,220
would give their word of truth and
their word of truth was usually about,

178
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,800
you know, how fucked up
America is, which I mean there,

179
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:25,740
there are very real grievances underlying
all of this and that's the problem,

180
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:28,450
right? They have things to exploit, um,

181
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:33,150
writing these things for these
gentlemen. I imagine. I mean,

182
00:10:33,151 --> 00:10:35,910
imagine they were definitely paying
them and they organize the channel.

183
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:39,120
It seems likely channels organized.
Yeah. That particular one,

184
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:41,550
I think that they were actually,
they were in on it.

185
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:45,040
They knew what they were doing.
That guy,

186
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,940
one of the guys who was in that channel
popped up again in 2018 right before the

187
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,370
midterms. Like, maybe even the day before,

188
00:10:53,371 --> 00:10:55,680
I'm trying to remember the timeline here.
Um,

189
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,940
and he made a different video saying
he wanted to, this was amazing,

190
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:03,660
saying he wanted to leave the internet
research agency kind of. So he was saying,

191
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:08,430
um, basically, um, I'm
tired of doing this work.

192
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,320
I want to,
I want to do a leak,

193
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:13,230
I want to show you all of the things at
the Internet research agency has done.

194
00:11:13,231 --> 00:11:15,240
And so they actually put out this.

195
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,270
So this guy who had been in
the Williams and Calvin video,

196
00:11:18,271 --> 00:11:23,271
so people recognize his face in the
2018 midterms goes and says he wants to

197
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:28,610
leave and he's going to leak
all this information and sorry,

198
00:11:28,611 --> 00:11:33,000
this damn cough. Um, and he
wants to to like confess,

199
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,210
I don't remember all the specifics because
it was right before my thing came out

200
00:11:36,211 --> 00:11:39,120
and I was so busy working.
But um, but yeah, he,

201
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,160
he pops up again and he is saying he like
wants to expose the truth and I think

202
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,510
most people didn't cover it,
didn't pay attention. Youtube,

203
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:51,480
shut down the channel and deleted
the video immediately. Um,

204
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,720
I think that it was seen as another
influence operation. You know,

205
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:57,580
you don't trust the,
um,

206
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:02,860
so even his intention that he's going
to expose it was probably just another

207
00:12:02,861 --> 00:12:05,890
level. Well, what wound
up coming out, this was,

208
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,470
this is so convoluted.
I'm sorry.

209
00:12:08,471 --> 00:12:12,130
I know it's like hard to
explain without visuals. Um,

210
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,950
what they wound up doing was
they did drop a bunch of docs,

211
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,330
so they did release a pile of documents
in which they claimed they actually

212
00:12:19,331 --> 00:12:22,060
hacked the Mueller investigation.
Mueller had nothing.

213
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,400
And so this is again another kind of um,

214
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:30,620
convoluted piece of this where
they do release information.

215
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,830
And so in this particular example,

216
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:36,310
they release information that we
believe they actually got through legal

217
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:37,144
discovery.

218
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:41,200
So the documents that the investigation
provided to one of the indicted Russians

219
00:12:41,201 --> 00:12:45,040
were the documents that they then leaked
claiming they had hacked the Mueller

220
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:49,870
investigation. So they're constantly
doing these things to generate press,

221
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:54,190
generate attention, create just that
degree of people don't know what's real.

222
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,150
Um,

223
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:59,710
or they read the headlines that are
then released by the more propagandist.

224
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,810
We overt Russian propaganda and they
think that that is the true story,

225
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:06,220
that, that, that, that is, um, that,

226
00:13:06,221 --> 00:13:10,450
that the Russians hacked the Mueller
investigation. So there's always this, um,

227
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,830
how do we create fear, uncertainty,
and doubt? How do we throw people off?

228
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,820
How do we come up with these
extremely convoluted spy games, um,

229
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,560
that leave people feeling unbalanced,

230
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:25,000
that make people wonder what they can
trust, who they can trust and what's real?

231
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,430
And even as somebody who
looks at this stuff, you know,

232
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:32,020
day in and day out for years, um, I,

233
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,220
I do still regularly get surprised by the,
uh,

234
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,930
by the sheer kind of ballsiness
and ingenuity of, of, of, you know,

235
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,510
some of the stuff as it,
as it comes to light.
