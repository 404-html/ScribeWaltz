1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:06,300
It was just,
it was fun having a kid style podcasts.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,040
Is it nurse did, were you nervous
at first to have them? Yes. Yeah.

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,700
Nervous to be vulnerable,

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,510
nervous to love something
that much nervous to have
that kind of responsibility.

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,750
Nervous about all those things change
as you change as you like nothing else.

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,300
But did you feel like the changes would
be for like a that you won't like the

7
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:30,540
changes and then you did like, I'm
like, did you have reservations? Well,

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,530
I didn't have a relationship
with my father growing up,

9
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,770
so for me it's very,
it was very,

10
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:41,580
very important that I did whatever I had
to do to have a relationship with them,

11
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:46,050
to be as present as I can be,
to like whatever,

12
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,240
whoever I was before I had them to,
to evolve to get better.

13
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,530
Like it's, it's, it's a
very, when you have kids,

14
00:00:55,531 --> 00:01:00,531
it's a very weird thing what happens
to you because you all the sudden it's,

15
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,580
you're not alone anymore. Like you like
you, you don't just have responsibility.

16
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:07,850
Like you have a dog you
have to feed or a plant,

17
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,150
you have a little person and you don't
want to fuck up that little person.

18
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:16,650
You're like shit and it feels overwhelming
and then the world feels so dangerous.

19
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,010
Change the view of the world.
Oh God, there's so much threat.

20
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,900
There's so much out there that
could signs, planes, stories too.

21
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:29,220
You read stories about terrible people
and terrible things that happen. Oh,

22
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:30,930
and then you're like, fuck,
I don't have to worry about,

23
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:33,300
this just happened to me afterward when
this happened to know somebody else to

24
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:38,310
then your little son or your little
daughter, you know? Yeah. That's wild bro.

25
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,140
That's crazy world.
And you,

26
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,790
you think of people differently because
you think of people as a project that

27
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:49,560
developed instead of being in a static
state. That's interesting. Did you,

28
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:53,820
did, did, do you think that something
like a emotionally happens to you?

29
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:57,660
Like at a level that the DNA
level? Yeah, the love you have.

30
00:01:57,661 --> 00:02:01,380
Like Dave Chappelle said, this basket
was not only to do increase my love,

31
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:05,970
it increased my capacity for love. And
that's a great way of putting it. I would,

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,850
I would agree 100%. It increases
your capacity. You become a nurse.

33
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:14,610
At least me, I became a nicer person,
but I've seen it not work too.

34
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,430
I've seen people that just rejected.

35
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,050
I've seen men and women that
just don't want to be parents.

36
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,180
I've seen women move away from their kids.

37
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:22,560
They don't want to take
care of their kids.

38
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:27,240
I've seen men abandoned their families.
They just don't want to do it. It's crazy.

39
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:33,350
I don't know if it's a mental
health issue or if it's just,

40
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,860
some people just can't take it.

41
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,210
Like there's like attitudes,

42
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,540
and this is not just
about raising children.

43
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,460
It's about pretty much
anything difficult in life.

44
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,750
There's some people that
have a very low quit point,

45
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,670
very low. They just quit. Everything
that quit. It gets tough, quit, quit.

46
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,260
There's a lot of people that just quit.
And, uh, when you have a little like,

47
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:01,120
say if you have a little Theo in front
of you and you think about your life and

48
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:04,900
your childhood and like how
important it is for you to,

49
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:10,060
to raise this little person and give
him love and teach them about life and

50
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:13,330
protect him and keep him safe and
give them good lessons in life.

51
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:18,940
It just changes. Everything,
changes, everything, changes,

52
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:23,350
everything. But it also has very
overwhelming, it's overwhelming.

53
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,290
People get serious anxiety
when they have kids.

54
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,470
They start thinking about the
responsibility and the weight of it all.

55
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,760
Or they don't,

56
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:34,120
some people just fucking take pills and
lay on the couch and let their kids suck.

57
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,540
Fucking carpet glass and the fucking
stick forks into the wall sockets and play

58
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:43,990
with knives. People just don't,
some people don't give a fuck,

59
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,040
but some people are dumb. That's a,
that's a thing too, man. I, you know,

60
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,180
people don't want to say this,

61
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,890
but there's folks out there that
just aren't equipped for life.

62
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,280
I really believe that. I think Dee come
the dumb brother. That's what I'm saying.

63
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,630
Take the semen out of him.
And I'm saying like at a certain point,

64
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,920
but here's the problem.
You're dumb compared to physicists.

65
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,900
So who's the WHO's to judge and who's to
say that this person is really stupid,

66
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,870
couldn't have a brilliant child
that happens to men. A lot of times,

67
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:15,910
brilliant people come out of stay, need
adversity, man who knows what they need,

68
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:20,911
but it's like it's not our job to decide
who's stupid and who's not because it

69
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:24,040
gets slippery. Yeah. You,

70
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:28,600
you could get boxed into that
stupid corner in a different metric.

71
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,500
If you're hanging around with a bunch
of people from Stanford in and they're

72
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,080
looking steel,

73
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,270
Vons and neighborhood and they know
there's 10 people in the neighborhood,

74
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:37,960
but only nine can survive. It's lean
resources for 9:00 PM to get rid of me.

75
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:40,630
Probably. It depends on how
good you are digging ditches

76
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:46,090
or it could be better than him at that
thou has suddenly have a different scale.

77
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,630
I Dunno. It's a, have you
thought about having kids? Yeah,

78
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,630
I think about it a lot more like as I
get a little bit older and I just, yeah.

79
00:04:52,631 --> 00:04:55,060
The thing for me is just like
about being brave, I think,

80
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:58,000
and just being willing to have my life
just be totally different and be okay

81
00:04:58,001 --> 00:04:58,960
with that.
Yeah.

82
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,380
And just be in like willing to know that
I will be okay in that space, you know?

83
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,140
Um, I think it's hard.
Uh, it's like, I just,

84
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,260
it's like I'm just starting to
manage this space that I'm in,

85
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,890
like as just has a regular person and
then to get to that point where now it's

86
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:15,530
like, fuck, you have another ball. You
have two balls in the air, you know,

87
00:05:15,531 --> 00:05:17,220
a wife and a kid, or, yeah.
