1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,380
The joe rogan experience.
Yup.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,220
But that's the problem that we'd
forbidden stuff. It never works well.

3
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:13,221
It's also a Italian food and
wine seem to go hand in hand and,

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,320
and it's,
I think,

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:21,210
I mean did they used to be what they
drank because they were concerned with

6
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:22,350
getting sick.
Right.

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:27,720
And one of the best ways to not get sick
was to drink wine because, well, yeah,

8
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:30,030
the alcohol content would
keep the water from,

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,010
I mean like if you just
drink water all the time,

10
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:36,000
especially if it's sitting still, you
could get some bad fucking water. Right.

11
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:37,920
You can get bad water from
a lake. I mean, how many,

12
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,440
they didn't know Jack Shit
about parasites back then.

13
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:44,490
How many people got some terrible diseases
from drinking puddle water and Shit,

14
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,300
you know? Sure. A lot. Oh yeah. He just
find some water like, oh, we're thirsty.

15
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:52,920
Time to drink. And, or even at creek you
drink in a creek and you think like, oh,

16
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:55,800
this is a beautiful stream.
This is a clear water. Yeah.

17
00:00:55,801 --> 00:01:00,801
But a beaver took a shit just a hundred
yards a match that you don't know about

18
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:04,290
it. You get what's called beaver
fever. That's what you're for real.

19
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:08,430
That's what they called Giardia. They call
it beaver fever. Yeah. That can be good.

20
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,630
Now it's terrible.

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,410
So they used to drink wine to prevent
what they would call traveler's disease

22
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,540
because people would take these,
those, what are those things called?

23
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,960
The leather things that they would
carry wine and I want to say flask,

24
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:23,460
but it's not a flask.
What are those?

25
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:28,370
Those those leather satchels I [inaudible]
I thought they use philosopher.

26
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,650
Dot. But I'm not sure. It
might be, there's a term,

27
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,910
it's like a leather bag and
it had like a on the end,

28
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:40,170
like a cork and he just drank from that.
And that's how they would hydrate. Yup.

29
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,390
People must have been
just hammered all day.

30
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,990
When you read the statistics of
how much people used to drink,

31
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:50,300
it's amazing that anything got done
because it's just people where that ain't

32
00:01:50,301 --> 00:01:54,510
good morning through night and her, they
must have been horrific to each other.

33
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,930
Then just just to imagine like a whole
civilization that is a drunken bar at

34
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:04,240
1:00 AM angry drag. Yeah.
It's funny cause I never,

35
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:06,300
and I mean I've seen it
enough that I get it.

36
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:11,301
People get edgy and weird
where when they drink too much,

37
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,190
but I never got it because to me
it's like if I'm drunk he like,

38
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,360
that's when I'm happy. I want
to hug people. Why would I
want to be in a bad mood?

39
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:23,130
This is also this. Well you're a nice
guy. That's what it is that comes out the,

40
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,000
yeah, if you're a fucking asshole
you, she'll drunk. I see you.

41
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,090
Especially if you just barely keeping
that ass hole under the surface.

42
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:33,900
She's barely just want to try and stab
her but in club them and steal their

43
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:38,690
women and then you get a couple of
drinks in you and this, this is alcohol.

44
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,320
Alcohol is a great social lubricant thing.

45
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,050
It's great for releasing inhibitions
and letting people communicate with each

46
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:50,400
other more freely and have fun.
But it's also,

47
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,130
it removes doubt and that's not good.
Right?

48
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,670
I think Todd is critical.

49
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:01,120
Like doubt is one of the pieces
of the great puzzle, right? The,

50
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:05,020
the great puzzle has many ingredients
and one of those ingredients is doubt and

51
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:05,980
doubt is important.

52
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,230
You should look at anything you're about
to contemplate and go think about this.

53
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:15,070
When we think what could go wrong when
you get a couple of drinks, fuck it,

54
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,090
let's do it, let's go. And
then next thing you know,

55
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,730
you know you're on an Internet
meme. Hold my PR. Yeah, exactly.

56
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:24,520
We talked about that yesterday, like
some of the most more ridiculous ones,

57
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:27,880
but there's so many of those out there
and almost all of them I have to do with

58
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:31,810
alcohol. [inaudible] right. And I
think what you are saying about dove,

59
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,770
there's a great Alan Watts, the guy who
polarizes an and that weighs in Mendota,

60
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,600
that stuff. He had these good eighth line,
he called it the wisdom of insecurity.

61
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,110
You know,
these ideas that had real careful,

62
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:49,140
there's always don't diary
not being dogmatic and which
doesn't mean the problem

63
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:53,830
is then people take that concept to Fairen
that donating to having no bowls and

64
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:56,620
not being able to pick a stand.
That's not a solution either.

65
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:58,480
That's the other side of the problem.

66
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,410
But there's a sweet spot in
between where you can take stances,

67
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,570
but they are careful stances.

68
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,380
They are sent stances that
are very willing to be
changed at the drop of a dime

69
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,980
if you show the good evidence to
to change them. You know? He's,

70
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,750
that to me is what intellectual honesty
looks like, you know? Yeah, I agree.

71
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,440
I think it's good to be aware
of all the possibilities.

72
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:23,830
I used to tell people that when
I was a teaching taekwondo,

73
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:27,040
like people that wouldn't compete
if they were really, really nervous.

74
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:27,760
I'd be like,

75
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,870
the really smart people are really
nervous because you're aware of all the

76
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,270
possibilities of everything
that could go wrong.

77
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,020
The people that aren't worried about
it at all, they're usually dumb.

78
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,250
There's that. But also to me, there
are some people, like I look at,

79
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:44,850
some of the people were able
to keep it together in this,

80
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,750
like kind of like Chuck Lee died,
right?

81
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,760
Take a nap right before
a fight kind of thing.

82
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,710
I can't tell by looking at those guys
and just be like, you know something.

83
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,600
I don't know what,
you know,

84
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,770
there's something there that you're
doing confidence for sure. I mean,

85
00:04:56,771 --> 00:04:58,780
chuck had been knocking
people unconscious for many,

86
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:02,260
many years and he knew exactly what to
do and I think knew he was good at it.

87
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,740
There's that for sure. And I think there's
the other side is knowing that, okay,

88
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:09,400
if I have decided to do it, fear is
not going to help me now. You know,

89
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:11,190
if that would me to make
decisions solely or,

90
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,110
but right now he's now going to
help me. So let's figure out, man,

91
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:18,660
he was hilarious. There's um, my
girlfriend fights MMA professionally.

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,420
You notice that? Yeah, she's wise.
I've been paying attention to uh,

93
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,950
your escapades online. She's,
she's crazy. She's crazy.

94
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,330
She said she literally at the
Chuck Liddell mode where she,

95
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,890
she took a nap right before
a fight and you know,

96
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:36,220
like 45 minutes before you have to
wake her up and going like, hey Randy.

97
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,550
And she's all like, okay,
ready to roll. And I'm like,

98
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,610
I would not sleep for a week prior out.

99
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,790
You managed to keep it together
like kids do. I used to do that.

100
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:49,900
I used to sleep before fights.
It's good. That's awesome.
Yeah, but it's you, you're,

101
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,780
you just can get yourself
into a more calm state.

102
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,950
It's so much better than I'm frantically
running around and freaking fretting

103
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,350
plus is a, it's a, it
freaks out your opponents.

104
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:02,090
I would sleep like right in the bleachers.

105
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,690
I just go to sleep right there and
everybody else would be nervous and shit.

106
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:07,880
And you're sleeping. Exactly.
Do you look at them and that,

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,390
I'm supposed to find that guy. The guy
was sleeping right before the fight.

108
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,830
Hell No. Like the first match
studied. I was nuts because you know,

109
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:19,760
you're in the locker room and there's
the guy sitting next to you goes out for

110
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:23,780
his match. Come right back.
[inaudible] covered bladder.
They're telling you, okay,

111
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:27,440
you get ready, you're going
next. And I'm dying. Right.

112
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,520
I just see kid Outta hell.
And she's all like La la, la.

113
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:41,650
Okay.
