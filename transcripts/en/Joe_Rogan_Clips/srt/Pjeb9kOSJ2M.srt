1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
Sleep like a baby. Like last night I
got the ring that I do my sleep squad.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,970
I slept eight and a half hours last night
and I take a hundred milligrams of CBD.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,320
I take a little bit of Melatonin and I'm
just out. But you got to take a lot of,

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,970
and you wake up kind
of groggy when you do,

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,150
but if you're used to that and you
know, like you get up, shake it off,

6
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:21,100
10 minutes later you're good to
go. What's the [inaudible]? Well,

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,910
probably just overstimulation
of the endocannabinoid system.

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,410
Here's like super relaxed, which I want
to be when I sleep. Of course. Yeah. Yeah,

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,640
yeah. It works. What about regular
marijuana? Does that affect your sleep?

10
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:34,560
Do you find it beneficial or no?

11
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,150
So CBD can enhance your deep sleep cycles.
All right.

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:39,631
Which is,

13
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:43,890
which is when a good majority of your
neuronal repair and recovery occurs,

14
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,020
THC allows you to sleep and it
actually decreases sleep latency,

15
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,940
how long it takes you to fall asleep.

16
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,890
But it does reduce the amount of
time you spend in deep sleep. Right?

17
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:58,980
So if you're, if you're one of
those people whose mind races,

18
00:00:58,981 --> 00:01:02,610
who's hypercharged up when it, you know,
and you got to get to sleep at night,

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,780
use THC, like you know,
hit a vape pen or whatever,

20
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,860
but know that you might miss out on
some of the things you want during deep

21
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:15,270
sleep, memory consolidation, neuronal
repair and recovery. You know,

22
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:16,620
nervous system repair,

23
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,890
but it's still pretty decent sleep and
you're not getting as much of a reduction

24
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:27,370
in deep sleep as you would get if you
were to be taking like ambien or Vallian

25
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,260
or something that's literally just like
a sledgehammer for your frontal cortex

26
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,310
that knocks you out. But you almost
get no deep sleep. So if you do this,

27
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:37,740
if you were to get like a sleep tracker
and test your deep sleep levels,

28
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,300
you would find that with CBD
you don't fall asleep as fast,

29
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,550
but you get higher deep sleep levels.

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,400
And then with THC you
can fall asleep faster,

31
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,380
but your deep sleep isn't quite as high.

32
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,340
When you consider that CBD can
counteract a lot of effects that THC,

33
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:58,500
then that means that what you could
try is take THC to lie to fall asleep

34
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:01,350
faster, but then pile a whole
bunch of CBD on top of that.

35
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,910
And I've done that before too,

36
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:06,420
where just take a hit on a vape pen and
then take a bunch of CBD and shoot for

37
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:10,530
the best of both worlds. Folks that
are taking ambient, I mean that is,

38
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,500
I mean especially people that are
doing it virtually every night,

39
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,790
that has got to have a profound effect
on your brain's ability to recover.

40
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,170
I think there are a lot of people shorting
themselves on the life who are taking

41
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:25,380
ambien or Vallian. I mean I,
I think to start with sleep,

42
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,320
you need to rely on your
body's own internal chemistry
and that would be breath

43
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:34,830
work. Like I think everybody, before
they start taking whatever phosphatidyl,

44
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:39,060
searing and adaptogenic herbs and all
this shit for cortisol and before they

45
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:42,360
start taking Valium or Ambien
or anything else for sleep,

46
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,570
you should learn how to control
your physiology with your breath.

47
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,660
I think that's the most
powerful way to do it. I mean,

48
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,970
you Prawna your shock or
whatever you want to call it,

49
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,840
like being able to do things
like breath work, box breathing,

50
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,450
alternate nostril breathing,
uh,

51
00:02:57,451 --> 00:03:02,020
even even holotropic like you can go
some very interesting places in terms of

52
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:06,330
DMT production by the pineal gland,
by just doing holotropic breathwork.

53
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,203
Like there's,

54
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,910
there's a lot of very interesting
things that you can do with your breath,

55
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:14,170
but I think that for getting to
sleep or for decreasing stress,

56
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,320
you start with the breath and then you
start to introduce some of these other

57
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:17,890
molecules.

58
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:22,620
But ambien Valium like in the era of
like readily available CVD and you know,

59
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,110
all the other sleep compounds that we
have available like Valerian and passion

60
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:28,270
flower and Camomile and you know,

61
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:32,560
all of those are what are called gamma
aminobutyric acid or Gaba precursors.

62
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:35,580
They produce inhibitory neurotransmitters.
Like God,

63
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,740
I don't understand why people are still
taking ambien and Valium because they're

64
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:41,830
idiots. Yeah, there's this addicted
to it or they just want a pill.

65
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:43,120
I mean that's essentially what it is.

66
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,380
They want some fat in their box
and they want ambien and Valium.

67
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,500
I don't know if it's the same folks,
but may times it is.

68
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,390
I think it's our president. I think
our president takes that shit. He,

69
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:55,960
I think he's sleeping with ambien. I
think a lot of politicians do that. Well.

70
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:00,400
They can't sleep otherwise. They're
fucking ruining the world. I, um, I,

71
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:02,140
I've found that if my brain is racing,

72
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:04,930
just completely concentrating on
breathing in and breathing out and

73
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:06,970
concentrating on just the breath itself,

74
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:10,120
like really being
cognizant of it and slow,

75
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,930
deliberate breaths in and out and in.

76
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,980
And now by doing that over long periods
of time, I've, I've found that I can,

77
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,640
I can pretty much calmed myself
out. You can, but that takes focus.

78
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,090
A lot of people are not willing to learn
how to do that because they want the

79
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:28,870
fast track out. They should take a drug
and pass out. That is the thing, right?

80
00:04:28,871 --> 00:04:30,220
They just want a pill.
Yeah.

81
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,460
It's very unfortunate that those
things exist in that, that,

82
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,820
that sort of thinking is,
you know,

83
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:41,740
it's reinforced. Yeah. Yeah.
It's encouraged. In fact,

84
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:46,760
you know, all these ads and all
these doctors and different people,

85
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,660
well if you have a hard time sleeping,
I'll just write you a prescription.

86
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,710
And then next thing you know,

87
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,830
and I mean you look at the animal
world like they self medicate,

88
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:56,680
they'll use clay for
parasites and you know,

89
00:04:56,681 --> 00:05:01,120
dogs leak grass for stomach issues and
you know that I guess birds now are

90
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:04,840
putting like nicotine and cigarettes and
their nest because there's some kind of

91
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,620
benefit to that.
And you see animals self-medicating,

92
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,120
you see our ancestors using
everything from you know,

93
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,950
cannabis to say loan cinnamon to you know,

94
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:17,530
all sorts of different derivatives
for thousands of years.

95
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,880
So it's not like supplementation or self
medication or the or the whole creation

96
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:25,990
of pharmaceuticals is something that's
unnatural or not unacceptable human

97
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:28,870
activity.
But once you start to use it as a crutch,

98
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,510
I think that's where you
run into issues like once,

99
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:36,511
once you deny the human body's ability
to be able to heal itself or to be able

100
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:40,870
to decrease stress on its own, you begin
to rely on these exogenous chemicals.

101
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:42,640
I think that's where he
started playing with fire.

102
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,960
I just wonder what's happening to people's
minds over longterm use of this stuff

103
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:50,170
where you're not going into these deep
sleep cycles and you're using it every

104
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:52,090
night because essentially
once you get hooked on it,

105
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:57,150
a lot of people have a really
hard time sleeping without
it. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I mean,

106
00:05:57,151 --> 00:05:59,150
uh, they're shorting
themselves. Right, right.

107
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,890
I wonder what studies in the Emory,
it's learning like that.

108
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:06,170
That's where a lot of that
type of stuff happens. I mean,

109
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:10,250
it's the same thing with,
with um, uh, what's it called?

110
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:12,140
Glymphatic drainage like this,

111
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:16,640
this new drainage system for the brain
that they've just discovered in recent

112
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:16,641
years.

113
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:21,641
This idea that you actually detoxify the
brain during the sleep cycles and it's

114
00:06:22,221 --> 00:06:24,260
even enhance when you sleep on your side.

115
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:27,800
They didn't looked at sleeping positions
in this thing called glymphatic

116
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:28,634
drainage.

117
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,930
And when you're not going through
proper sleep cycles or you're constantly

118
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:35,040
waking cause you're on your
back and you have, you know,

119
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,540
a lot of people have sleep apnea where
you'll look at their sleep charts and

120
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,310
they'll frequently wake during the night.

121
00:06:40,311 --> 00:06:43,950
Or though you'll see periods where they
just get ripped out of deep sleep. Yeah.

122
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,620
You wake up and you don't have memory
consolidation or you don't have the type

123
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:51,310
of neuronal repair and recovery
that you'd want or you know, you,

124
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,010
you can't even short yourself on muscle
repair. You know, and, and there's,

125
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:59,930
there's probably a lot that we don't know
about just dreaming and its ability to

126
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:04,580
be able to do things like help form
memories or, or make, you know,

127
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:09,410
learning or experiences more deeply
rooted. But yeah, I mean it's, it's, it's,

128
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,000
I think sleep architecture is something
that just gets super fucked up in a

129
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,260
modern post industrial era.

130
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:18,650
We've got access to pharmaceuticals and
just take a sledgehammer to our heads.

131
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,870
Yeah, no question about it. And it's also,

132
00:07:20,871 --> 00:07:25,871
there's been a lot of work done on
actually going to sleep with a problem.

133
00:07:26,421 --> 00:07:28,970
It's whole idea of sleep on it.
Like there's,

134
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,210
there's actually something
real to that that there was,

135
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:37,430
there's some cognitive balancing
that's going on while you're sleeping,

136
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:41,030
while your mind is actually going over
whatever issues you might have and trying

137
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:44,660
to come up with a problem during
sleep time during your subconscious,

138
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,530
you don't want to know how
many times now I, and I'm,

139
00:07:47,531 --> 00:07:52,531
I'm learning this as I get older that you
delay a decision or you delay replying

140
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:57,680
to an email or delay responding to a text
message or what have you until you've

141
00:07:57,681 --> 00:08:01,100
gotten a full night of sleep on it and
the clarity that you get after that.

142
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,230
I mean he just basically think about it
a little bit before you fall asleep and

143
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,240
then you go to sleep and you wake
up with such a better answer.

144
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:10,900
The same thing with a lock on it, like
walk on it is another thing. We know you,

145
00:08:10,901 --> 00:08:15,530
you make more nerve growth factor and
more brain derived neurotrophic factor

146
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:20,400
when you walk while you're learning. I
recently gave a Tedx talk and I just, I,

147
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,600
I have made the whole Tedx talk and
I learned the whole thing while I was

148
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:26,360
walking up on the farm
road back behind my house.

149
00:08:26,361 --> 00:08:27,650
I just walk them through the forest,

150
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,090
pop out in the sunshine and walk up and
down that road and just listen to my ted

151
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:35,630
talk on my ear buds and give
my talk. And it's just, it's a,

152
00:08:35,631 --> 00:08:38,690
it's amazing for the
brain. But yeah, I agree.

153
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,010
Dwelling on something before you go
to sleep. It does the trick. I always,

154
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,000
if I do that, I always have a
response the next day. That's kinder,

155
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:52,220
less emotional, more understanding,
friendlier, um, you know,

156
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:55,860
a reciprocating,
any,

157
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:59,570
any sort of good vibes. It's, it's,
it's really interesting. It's really,

158
00:08:59,571 --> 00:09:03,210
it really interesting how there is some
sort of a wisdom that's a part it on you

159
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:04,880
while you're sleeping. There is, and,

160
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,920
and now what I do is I'll
think about what it is,

161
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:12,690
but I am a big fan of fiction before you
fall asleep and just let you escape to

162
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:13,471
a whole different world.

163
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,860
I took my kids on this giant tour
of New York City like we went to.
