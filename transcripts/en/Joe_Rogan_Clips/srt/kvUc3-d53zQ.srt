00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:05,130
Hello Freak bitches we're going to do now.
Um,

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,710
this is, this is my single off my new
record that comes out on your birthday.

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,260
August 11 called ghost in my bed.
MMM.

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,050
There's a music video out
for it now if anyone wants,

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,770
where does someone get that? Can you get
to youtube? Is that okay? It's on youtube.

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:26,320
Youtube and uh, coincidentally it
is kcrws toone of the day today.

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,640
Oh, I don't even know how
that's possible. Well,

8
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:35,820
it's a little loud. Okay. I'm going
to tune it up like a real profession.

9
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,170
Tune up with your phone.
No. Yeah. Really? Yes.

10
00:00:41,171 --> 00:00:45,970
Joseph, they have these things
that did the instruments.

11
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,850
What is it on your phone? Like
I'm, I'm totally ignorant to this

12
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,440
microphone.
Get distracting frequency,

13
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:54,613
right?

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,350
What is it called? It's just an APP.
It's a guitar to just hundreds of them.

15
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,210
Oh Wow. There's a bunch of them. Huh?
Here. What are you singing right now? Wow.

16
00:01:04,211 --> 00:01:08,050
And it works off of the microphone on
your phone the same way one would work

17
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,270
like in a studio sonically and pretty
good. It could be in a better situation.

18
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,390
Should I give it another angle?
No, that's fine. That's fine. Okay.

19
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:18,883
You want to do this?

20
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,940
Oh wait, should I get my pick or
should I go fingers? You get your pig.

21
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,300
You hit your peak. Like a
real pig with you counseling.

22
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:35,580
Cause I'm playing all fingers. These
their shirts. Right. What's that?

23
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,860
It might be one. Oh, there are fun.
Yeah. Then get, yeah. Are you sure?

24
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,400
I'm just kind of picks bro them.

25
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:50,560
Oh
God.

26
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,490
Stop it.

27
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,660
Boozy amaze me Tom.

28
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,510
Thanks.
It's so funny.

29
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,120
Oh,
long child.

30
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,913
Wow.

31
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,930
Eh,

32
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,593
Leo

33
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,013
keys.

34
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:36,933
Oh,

35
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,810
it was me,

36
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,820
my chest

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Da Dad.

38
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:06,990
Cause he

39
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,520
always gets me

40
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,850
from a star

41
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,290
Kcrw song.

42
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,670
That was awesome. Thanks. My
pleasure. Jane. Here's the shit.

43
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,750
I took my headphones off. I hope I didn't
ruin the Howells. Awesome. Beautiful.

44
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,450
Sorry. Perfect. Don't say a word here.

45
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:14,660
Okay.
