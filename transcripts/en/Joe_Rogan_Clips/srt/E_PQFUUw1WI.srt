1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,510
What I've noticed though
is I was in Portland,

2
00:00:03,511 --> 00:00:08,370
Oregon and there was a whole like
city of homeless people. Yeah. In La,

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:09,420
it's this just

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,770
sparklies like Jimmy's on top
of an ice cream, you know,

5
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:16,830
you gotta go to skid row skid,
you never seen anything like it.

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,790
Skim Rosa homeless city.
It's insane.

7
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:22,160
It's thousands of homeless people
wandering through the streets. They,

8
00:00:22,161 --> 00:00:26,490
they've taken over entire neighborhoods.
Like it is, it is bizarre.

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,040
It's bizarre.
We used to film fear factor downtown.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,340
We would a film it at
these abandoned warehouses.

11
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:36,270
They would rent them out and we'd, you
know, throw people off the roof and shit.

12
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,800
And uh,
we,

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,030
there was this one area
where you would go where,

14
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:46,080
and I'm not exaggerating, there might
be a thousand people on this block,

15
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:47,520
like a concert just let out.

16
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,090
Like they were having a homeless concert
and they're all just wandering around.

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,680
There's needles everywhere and tense
and garbage in the streets and,

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,320
and people just shuffling around,
walking back and forth. So there's,

19
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,350
I guess there's some homeless centers,
you know,

20
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:05,310
where people can go and get food
and things and shelter. You know,

21
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,610
I'm starting to wonder like,

22
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:13,611
what's wrong with me with you
because I seem to focus on that.

23
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,670
You know, every city I go to I say, wow.

24
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,780
It seems like there's more
and more homeless people
and other people are saying,

25
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:23,400
oh, let's go to the freedom trail. Let's,

26
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:27,210
let's look at the beauty of San
Francisco. Look, I shit on the street.

27
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:29,280
To me that's like unusual.

28
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:33,150
San Francisco has an app where you could
find where the people are shitting.

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,360
They have not jumped through.
Pulled it up before. Yeah.

30
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,250
There's so many people shitting
in San Francisco on the street.

31
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:45,390
San were like my friend Jake shields get
a photo of this guy taking a shit right

32
00:01:45,391 --> 00:01:47,910
in front of them.
Just shit sprain out of his ass.

33
00:01:47,911 --> 00:01:51,290
Running into the street from
the side of the street. No,

34
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,030
I don't know why and they just
do it in front of everybody.

35
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,860
I don't know why people,

36
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,170
you know who's sick or the person with
the APP or the guy taking a dump. Well,

37
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:04,950
I think there's a certain open mindedness
that San Francisco has a lot of very

38
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:07,500
progressive open minded people.
Which is good,

39
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,630
but the problem is it opens the door
for some ridiculous stuff like people

40
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:15,660
shitting on the street.
There's too many homeless people too.

41
00:02:15,661 --> 00:02:19,500
They're too open minded and to
liberal. Look at that. That's the,

42
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,160
that's the shit map.
That's where all the people are shitting.

43
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:28,410
That's a dark puddle of shit where so
many people were shitting on the street in

44
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:32,640
that area and I don't even know how they
cleaned that up. I mean, what do they do?

45
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,820
They scrape it hose a street
down. Is that an extra, is that,

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,650
are they creating jobs?
Let's look at it on the positive side.

47
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,080
Maybe those homeless people reminds me
of the parades when they stepped the

48
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:45,690
horses. There's nothing you could do
either. I mean, what are you going to do?

49
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:47,430
Are you going to give these
people a place to live?

50
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,980
I'm going to give these people food.
You going to give these people money?

51
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,410
There's, it's not going to
fix their mental illness.

52
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,380
That's what people don't understand
about a lot of these folks.

53
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:58,650
It's not that they run on bad luck,
that's they're not on bad luck.

54
00:02:58,651 --> 00:03:01,450
They're mentally ill. They have,
their brain's not working correctly.

55
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,870
And if they don't want to be on medication
and they don't have any way to turn,

56
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:06,070
they don't have anywhere to go.

57
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,670
They're going to stay there and they
don't have anywhere to shit. And you know,

58
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,760
they just want to use this treat.

59
00:03:11,761 --> 00:03:14,800
And I don't know if they could put up
Porta potties and say for homeless folks

60
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,170
only, and what can they do? We're not
going to solve that on the Joe Rogan.

61
00:03:18,171 --> 00:03:21,100
She might. I'm, I'm an
optimistic person. Steve,

62
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,570
you never know. I was thinking
to myself, he just, you know,

63
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,710
it's just shit in your pants.
