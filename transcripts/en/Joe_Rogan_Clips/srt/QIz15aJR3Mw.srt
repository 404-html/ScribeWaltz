1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,270
The book is outstanding and you know it's,
it's,

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,070
it's more than just sitting with like
sitting across from you and you telling

3
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:09,360
your story is one thing,

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,690
but this long detailed history of how
you became to be the person you became.

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:21,140
I think it's very educational for
people because they can realize like,

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,320
oh, he wasn't always this guy. Right?
This is what's fucked up about people.

7
00:00:25,321 --> 00:00:27,690
Like you see a guy who's
like you, who runs, I mean,

8
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:30,750
how many ultra marathons did you run
in a row? You've ever had some insane,

9
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,330
I read 808 weekends in a row to stop and
think about that ladies and gentlemen.

10
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,100
Eight hundreds means eight 100 mile races,

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,110
eight weekends in a row,

12
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:46,470
a hundred mile race will put you out
for fucking six months, right? You know,

13
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,170
and you rent eight of them,
eight weekends or it's a fuck.

14
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,450
It's a fucking insane accomplishment.
It was nuts.

15
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,840
You think about a person like that,
you think of them as in this like static,

16
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:58,440
fully formed version.
You don't usually get to see,

17
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,240
and especially someone like you who you
went into so much depth about your rise

18
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:05,010
and fall and rise and fall.

19
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:09,480
It wasn't like a straight linear process
between you getting inspired and then

20
00:01:09,481 --> 00:01:14,280
you becoming this bad motherfucker. No, it
wasn't like, um, what's that show called?

21
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,580
Um,
that will Smith plays that,

22
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:21,060
that black guy who kind of makes
it in, um, in the financial world,

23
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,570
a pursuit of happiness. I never
saw that. Yeah, it's a great movie.

24
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:26,220
It wasn't like pursuit
of happiness, man. Like,

25
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,670
like with a guy who struggles and he,
and he gets over it and he makes it,

26
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,440
I fell on my ass.

27
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,540
I thought I'd got the top of Mount
Everest and Mont Everest just fucking sly

28
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:38,190
right underneath me, man. I was like,
God, dog. I start from scratch again.

29
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,300
Scratch became my friend, literally.
Man. So, you know, that's the,

30
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:44,670
that's how we put in the book
match. Going up, going down,

31
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:48,240
going up just to real raw
version of how my life was in.

32
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,130
It was so in depth to go back through
your life with a fine tooth comb that I

33
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:55,890
almost got embarrassed. Even put
it out there to people. Yeah,

34
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,160
that'd be north damn man.
Like even me right now to talk to you.

35
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:03,870
I'm in the car for a fucking hour
getting pumped up because I'm a shy

36
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,180
introverted leave me alone type of guy.

37
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,650
Like I'm still that motherfucker
who is six years old,

38
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,490
you know at a play who can't say as line
because I know I'm going to stutter in

39
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:17,880
front of five people. So I walk
off the stage. That's still me.

40
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,640
So everyday I'm fighting that dude.
So people think, oh my God, man,

41
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,340
you in a pod case looks
so crazy, so evil. No,

42
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,370
I'm trying to be locked into Joe so my
mind isn't veer off saying let's run out

43
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:33,150
the damn door because people are
watching me on the fucking podcast. Oh,

44
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,350
won't open it damn door and get the hell
out of here man. So that's the real me.

45
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,490
So I'm not sadistic man.

46
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:42,450
I'm focused on what I have to do to
stay locked into the game of life.

47
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,680
And that's what, and that's why I tell
people, man, I go there, I go there.

48
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,830
That's one of the reasons why this book
is so good is because you're so honest

49
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:52,470
about your vulnerabilities
and how you overcome them.

50
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:57,240
And for people that see someone who's
a beast, who's done great things,

51
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,580
you just assume that they're
different than you, right?

52
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,520
But then you hear about your insecurities
and your pitfalls and all the things

53
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:06,080
that went wrong with you,
and you realize what God dammit,

54
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,810
those the same things
that go wrong with me.

55
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,010
Like maybe I have that inside of me
and I've just never summoned it. Right.

56
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,600
And I'll tell you this,

57
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:16,390
I started really realizing that
when I started overcome myself,

58
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,950
I started getting around these real
alpha males, these hard, hard men.

59
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,250
And I always put people way above me
when I was growing up like my God,

60
00:03:25,251 --> 00:03:27,370
they had to have a lot more than
me to get to where they're at.

61
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,630
And a lot of them did.
But once you get around the,

62
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,870
the best of the best of the best people,

63
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,900
you can kind of start breaking
them down. And realizing, man, you,

64
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,330
you're just as fucked up as
me. Like, like we all have.

65
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,950
But all you did was you hit it
better. Your, your, your upbringing,

66
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,040
your mom and dad, your society,
the way you were raised,

67
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,500
it hit it better than the mine.

68
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:54,700
You weren't the only black kid or there
was like five a in a school, you know,

69
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,750
I can't hide going through buds.
I was the only black kid you can't hide.

70
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,290
But I started realizing just
because I look different than you,

71
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,640
a lot of you must first can hot either.

72
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,090
So it started giving me courage through
watching people that were all have a

73
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:09,580
story. We all have a jacked
up life in one way or another.

74
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,890
Some of us don't have the
guts to talk about it though.

75
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,080
And that's where I found
the guts to talk about mine.

76
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,740
Well there's some does purity
in physical pursuits, right?

77
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:20,050
Because it doesn't matter
what your social status is.

78
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,990
It doesn't matter how people
perceive you. When, uh,

79
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,740
when it comes down to how long can you
stay in that pool when it comes down to

80
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:27,910
how far can you run,

81
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:32,410
when it comes down to how much can you
push yourself past the part where you

82
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:36,330
want to quit or how far can
you keep going? There's a
purity in that that it did,

83
00:04:36,331 --> 00:04:39,520
did dissolve social order,
all that bullshit,

84
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,940
all the what people think about you goes
out the window. It's what, who will,

85
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:46,840
who are you right now? Cause right boy
you right now that's a true statement man.

86
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,790
And I look at his size as psychological
warfare and that's where I started

87
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,450
learning that that life is one big
psychological warfare that you play on

88
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:57,610
yourself. You play on yourself. Man.

89
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,420
The most important conversation
ever had my is with myself.

90
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,870
And the Shit I was telling myself
was so fucked up. It was so wrong.

91
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:08,110
It was so misguided.
And other people start to write that down.

92
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:12,490
Luck for you also and start to be what
you say to yourself every single day.

93
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,340
And I started creating
a whole nother warfare,

94
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,340
a whole nother battle started becoming
them. I was like, oh, hang on a second.

95
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:22,240
Goggins you have these tools
that he had these tools.

96
00:05:22,241 --> 00:05:24,730
Your life was basically the perfect,

97
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,900
the perfect grounds for training for
where you need to go in your life.

98
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,380
All the beatings, all the, all
the bullying, all the, you know,

99
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:35,230
you going through a learning disability,
all the struggles.

100
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,860
It was the absolute perfect training
ground for you to go to where you need to

101
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:43,300
go. And that's how I started looking at
my life versus woe is me. Poopy pants.

102
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,750
Kick a rock down the street mentality.
It was na God.

103
00:05:46,751 --> 00:05:49,870
This hooked you right the fuck up.
He looked you right up man,

104
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:54,310
with the perfect place you are training
for the first 18 1920 so you were

105
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:55,690
training for this stuff,
man.

106
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:00,770
You got the advantage of everybody else
versus my God, they're so above me.

107
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,690
They came from a great family. Mom and
dad loved them. They didn't have a learn.

108
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,180
Danny's daughter, they
didn't struggle. Nah Man,

109
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,820
you're struggle is what
made you who you are now.

110
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,490
So I started flipping this
into a whole different,

111
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:16,310
I started being a master of was scared of,

112
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:21,311
I was get up my mind and I became
literally a master of that mind and that's

113
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:24,620
what now from now on,
it sets me apart from most people.

114
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,030
I started diving into that.

115
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,680
That is a big part of the stories when
you go over your childhood and you know

116
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,940
your abusive father and then having this
great God that was going to become your

117
00:06:35,941 --> 00:06:38,010
stepdad and then he gets murdered.

118
00:06:38,011 --> 00:06:42,420
It's like right when you're about to get
out of it. Everything looks good, boom.

119
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,321
Then he gets murdered.

120
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:48,060
It's like these things really did sort
of set you up to start from scratch again

121
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:48,931
and just go,
okay,

122
00:06:48,931 --> 00:06:52,470
Roger that we start from scratch
and now you have that attitude.

123
00:06:52,471 --> 00:06:56,880
You developed it through all of
these horrible personal experiences,

124
00:06:56,881 --> 00:06:58,350
all the trials and tribulations,

125
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:03,180
all the evil shit that people try to
do to you that sort of set you up to be

126
00:07:03,181 --> 00:07:05,610
able to deal in a way that
a lot of people can't.

127
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,490
Well, I used to look at my life from a
different vantage point. And when you're,

128
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,630
when you're in all the muck and you just
walk in and muck and walking in muck

129
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:17,810
and walk in and Muck,
you don't see that.

130
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,290
If you look off to the fucking left of
the muck, there's a sidewalk, brother,

131
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,310
get off, get off of it. You have
your head down looking in this muck.

132
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,740
Once I saw the sidewalk,
got the sidewalk,

133
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,530
I got a little break and I
got different vantage point.

134
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,620
And then from the sidewalk I found
a cliff and I found a mountain.

135
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:36,560
I got way up high on top of my life and
look back down on it and said, okay,

136
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,330
I gotta figure this out man. I'm not
going anywhere. I'm trying to lie.

137
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:43,310
I'm starting like,
so when you have a messed up foundation,

138
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,550
I started lying about everything.
I wanted people to like me.

139
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,090
I want it to be accepted in some society
of life, some social society, you know.

140
00:07:51,091 --> 00:07:54,320
And I said, man, this isn't the
right way. I messed up here.

141
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:55,760
I messed up here and messed up everywhere.

142
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,930
And so I realized the worst thing
that happened to me is I lost myself.

143
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,730
I never had myself and her found myself.

144
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:06,950
I had no self esteem so I knew through
working out into learning can I it?

145
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,550
It took a lot for me to learn.
Also, I started finding self esteem.

146
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:13,760
Once I found that that's when doors
started opening up. I started,

147
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,930
I stopped caring about people that
what they thought being judged. Well,

148
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,810
if I say this, if I started right
now or you can make fun of me,

149
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,310
I stopped caring about that
and that's my life start.

150
00:08:23,311 --> 00:08:25,280
It really changed it for me.
Slowly but surely.

151
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,550
That's such an important point where
you're talking about the working out

152
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,440
because a lot of people when
they think about working out,

153
00:08:31,441 --> 00:08:33,810
they thinking of it as being a
physical thing, right? No. Oh

154
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,850
No. I did it for mental. Yeah. People
are say my God, like, no, don't,

155
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,100
don't look at it like I didn't
care about losing weight.

156
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,430
I care about being the fastest person. I
came out. I wasn't making the Olympics.

157
00:08:44,431 --> 00:08:46,920
I won't go into prose.
I could barely read and write.

158
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:49,950
When I was a junior in high school,
I wasn't going anywhere.

159
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,390
I saw working out as a way for
me to build calluses on my mind.

160
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:59,760
I a callous over the victim's
mentality. So I watched these movies. I,

161
00:08:59,761 --> 00:09:01,500
you know, I talked about rocky
last time I was out here.

162
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:07,220
I always equated training to mental
toughening like it was a brutal people

163
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:12,000
waking up early and do it. All these
things, they look, it looks horrible.

164
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,970
I was like, wow man, I got started
doing that. Not to get better,

165
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,670
bigger and stronger,
but that is what's going to build me.

166
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:21,390
That looks uncomfortable.
That looks brutal and getting up early.

167
00:09:21,391 --> 00:09:22,224
I don't want to do that.

168
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,150
Some of this long list of things I don't
want to do and through that I found

169
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:31,410
myself, I started d like, I'm
like, you guys aren't doing
this shit in high school.

170
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,280
Did you guys are getting
up at five o'clock in the
morning running over here and

171
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:37,640
his golf course. So I started
seeing myself very differently than,

172
00:09:37,641 --> 00:09:40,110
than the average human being.
I was like high on a second.

173
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,550
I have some they don't have and that's
when I start to develop these things

174
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:45,480
through working out.

175
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:50,650
It was this great never ending work ethic
and through work ethic I develop self

176
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,374
esteem.

177
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,430
Now is this something that you learned?

178
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,710
Is this something you learn yourself from,

179
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,280
from exercise yourself or is this
something you had read or heard about?

180
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,650
Like what made you equate this,

181
00:10:02,651 --> 00:10:05,980
doing this and doing these difficult
things physically to mental toughness to

182
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:09,340
being, this is the discipline that you
need in order to get your life out of the

183
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:10,610
situation you're in.
So

184
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,070
read anything. You know, I, I
could barely read, you know,

185
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:16,430
so I wasn't reading back then.
I just saw,

186
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:21,200
I watched a lot of movies and I was
really big into visualization and um,

187
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:26,290
I always equated working out to
struggle and I struggled my whole life,

188
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,140
but I ran from it. So I
started realizing, man,

189
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,620
I got to start facing the struggle and I
got be mentally strong for the struggle.

190
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,870
So that's why I started counting.
Coming up with like I,

191
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,870
I'm training for life mentally.
I'm training for life.

192
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,850
I'm not training for like to,

193
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,380
to lift 400 pounds and I found out on
my own pretty much is that through this,

194
00:10:45,381 --> 00:10:48,410
through through discipline, through
self discipline, through repetition,

195
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:52,410
do tons of repetition of the same thing
that you don't want to do. And that's it.

196
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:55,910
And that's the key thing through
repetition of things you don't want to do.

197
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,890
You develop mental,

198
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,510
like like an armor for your mind start
to arm or your mind. I was like, okay,

199
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:07,340
we suffer, we suffer every day. It's what
we do. We do stuff that sucks every day.

200
00:11:07,341 --> 00:11:10,520
So then when the suck stuff comes,
you're ready for it.

201
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,320
And that's how it started coming up.
You know?

202
00:11:12,321 --> 00:11:15,350
I just started being very uncomfortable
now. It's like a, just a way of life.

203
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,550
It's a crazy thing to figure out though.
It's like the,

204
00:11:18,551 --> 00:11:21,490
you figured it out and you didn't
just figured it out. You embraced it.

205
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,890
Like when you were talking about
your senior year of high school,

206
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:27,550
when you talking about your, your
mirror being your accountability mirror.

207
00:11:27,551 --> 00:11:29,440
Like you had a radical shift.

208
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,680
Like you just decided to
not be a fucking loser.

209
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,660
And to start tightening up and start
holding yourself accountable and,

210
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,440
and get ready for things.

211
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,430
So I had this my whole life.
I mean,

212
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,280
I don't know if people believe in God or
what, I don't care what you believe in.

213
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,530
There's been this
unrelenting voice in my head.

214
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:49,440
We all have this voice is
the right or wrong voice.

215
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:55,070
And a lot of times that voice guides us
into comfort and my voice got it mean to

216
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:59,350
comfort a lot. But I had this other
voice to her my whole life saying,

217
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:03,130
hey motherfucker, what are you doing?
Nah Man, we gotta go over here.

218
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,500
We'll go over here to,

219
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,810
to that rock pile over in a fucking
corner where nobody's at. That's,

220
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,650
that's where victory is at.
We're over in that corner.

221
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:15,100
So this voice was giving me all
these answers. Not I wouldn't,

222
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,300
real smart kid growing up,

223
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:20,980
but I had this crazy voice in my head
saying over there is where the fucking

224
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:24,980
answers are and I will listen to it.
Cause over there was pain over there.

225
00:12:24,981 --> 00:12:27,760
It was me looking in the mirror over
there was me being accountable for all

226
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:30,400
these things I went through my life
in though people put them on me.

227
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:33,670
It's now mine to own. And I didn't
want to go over there by myself,

228
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:37,570
but I had to in his voice was guiding me.
There is God,

229
00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:40,690
whatever you wanna call it. Um, but
that's what, that's what it was in me.

230
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,890
Do you think that's just what you eat
when you separate yourself from your ego

231
00:12:44,891 --> 00:12:45,440
and what,

232
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,390
what you were your insecurities and all
you like if you were giving yourself

233
00:12:49,391 --> 00:12:52,240
advice, you would say that's
what the thing is to do.

234
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:55,370
So do you think that's what it was?
Like your subconscious or the Oh,

235
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,360
you stripped away from all the bullshit
when he couldn't lie to yourself.

236
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,620
Cause it's a voice in your head.

237
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,240
Exactly it, that's exactly it. Because
it knew, it knew I was a character.

238
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,880
I was trying to find
myself do a character.

239
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:11,050
I was making different hairstyles
and sagging my pants and I was off.

240
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:16,270
I was off, man. I was, I was a
clown. I was a clown. And I was like,

241
00:13:16,271 --> 00:13:20,230
this is not, this is not
what you're supposed to be
in life, man. And it's ugly.

242
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:23,830
When you look in that dirty mirror and
you're trying to do a new hairstyle to go

243
00:13:23,831 --> 00:13:24,970
to school.
You know,

244
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:28,090
I had the hairstyle one time
where I shaved the top of my head.

245
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,900
You know how old men had the
hair leaving their hit? Yeah.

246
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:36,540
So I went to school with hair on the side
of my head and in my back and I shaved

247
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:41,600
the whole top of my head. I just, I would
to school like that, you know? And then I,

248
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:44,520
I'd had like what, what did
the kids say? I want to,

249
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,040
I don't remember what they said, but it
was, I was just a funny dude, you know?

250
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:51,610
So that was my thing. I was the
funny dude that came into school,

251
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:55,180
like criss cross came out when I was in
high school, so my pants were backwards.

252
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:55,541
I see.
No,

253
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:59,800
I don't have a pass backwards sag down
past my ass crack short term backwards

254
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:03,230
with a toothbrush in my
mouth with the reverse park.

255
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:07,510
Reverse part is your head is shaved
and you have some hair on top.

256
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,080
Just a little piece of hair versus
like a like a part two hair.

257
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,900
The part was on a bald head,
so it was this.

258
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:20,080
I was sitting at home instead of studying
I would think about what can I do to

259
00:14:20,081 --> 00:14:21,460
impress them mother fucker at school.

260
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,150
Why and that became my life and that is,

261
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:29,830
it's a long road to hoe to get to the
guy who says now you don't ever smile on

262
00:14:29,831 --> 00:14:32,740
any podcasts. Look so serious.
I look at that shit. I'm like,

263
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,980
you motherfuckers have no idea who I am.

264
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:38,890
Who were where I've come
from to get here today.

265
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,520
You could have probably
been an entertainer like you
probably because you were

266
00:14:42,521 --> 00:14:46,750
doing all that kind of shit. It has some
jokes. Joe, I got some jokes that you do.

267
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:51,660
So what people read in this book can
hurt me. It's a sad story. It's a story.

268
00:14:51,661 --> 00:14:52,520
It's a tragic story.

269
00:14:52,521 --> 00:14:56,390
It's a story that made me who end the
day but you got the morning laugh at

270
00:14:56,391 --> 00:15:00,140
yourself too. Once you, once you
go through that shit are now,

271
00:15:00,141 --> 00:15:03,050
so there's a lot of parts in, there was
lot me against a lot of white people,

272
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,240
you know, and I have a routine that I
won't do, so people who hire me to speak,

273
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:11,840
I'm not going to do the routine. I often
do it sometimes. And think about it,

274
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,170
I was at 36 black guy to go
through seal training. Okay.

275
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:20,340
Now how many people out of probably
looking at probably 1112 uh,

276
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,720
to, to, to make it through
probably 13,000 seals.

277
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,970
I'll probably the 36 I was a 36
black out and make it through.

278
00:15:26,971 --> 00:15:29,390
He never since like did
like the 1940s you know,

279
00:15:29,391 --> 00:15:32,450
you're looking at almost 70 years. Wow.
Yeah. So you know, you know, you know,

280
00:15:32,451 --> 00:15:33,410
do the math on that.

281
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:37,150
So there's not a lot of black guys and
so I take that and I make a nice comedy

282
00:15:37,151 --> 00:15:39,650
skit out of that Shit.
You know, like, like,

283
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,440
like the first time they tied me up and
threw me, it's called drown proofing.

284
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:47,550
So I'm negative, buoyant as
hill, you know, me too. Oh,
related to that big time. Yes.

285
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:51,710
You only a few white boys, man, are
there negative boy and that's hard.

286
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,780
So matching them,
getting your hands and feet,

287
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,650
Tonya asks up and throwing the
fucking water and say swim. Ah,

288
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,290
it was like throwing a cat in the
water with fucking brick on him.

289
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:04,490
So I was just losing my fucking mind.
So if somebody just had to get over,

290
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:09,470
you know, and I, and I, and I found humor.
I found humor in my suffering. I was like,

291
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:13,580
motherfucker, what are you doing out here?
Goggins like, this is crazy. Like you're,

292
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:16,520
you're literally trying
to reinvent the wheel.

293
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,900
But I was trying to reinvent my mind.

294
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,150
I was trying to reinvent my mind and I
used every single tactic possible to do

295
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:25,310
that. I didn't want to live, you know,

296
00:16:25,311 --> 00:16:27,890
live in this world where I was
a fake human being anymore.

297
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:32,150
And I was tired of blaming everybody
for where I was at. My Dad beat me.

298
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,310
This happened. I mean, my
dad ran prostitutes. Man.

299
00:16:34,311 --> 00:16:38,390
My Dad literally snatched the soul out
of my mom. Like my mom is still balanced.

300
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:42,050
Like after my mom left my dad and this
one I'm talking about in the book,

301
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,850
she got married three times for
a total of six months, you know,

302
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,580
and I'll go there and I'm not even
talking about the guy she married.

303
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,930
So this woman was, she, she's
beautiful. She's, she's so
smart. All this stuff, man.

304
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,000
This guy literally
stripped her Soloway and I,

305
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:01,730
and I was a young kid watching it and
I had no soul to begin with in my,

306
00:17:01,731 --> 00:17:05,150
and my brother, he has a story that
he could write eight books, you know,

307
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:09,860
my dad has came through and this
washed, it's all clean. So to, to,

308
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:13,490
to come still around. He died about
four years ago, four or five years,

309
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,800
if not for sure. I didn't go to
the funeral, but I forgave him.

310
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:20,030
So I saw my dad through an eight year
old's I. So, so we left and Jose,

311
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:24,440
and then at 22 I went back to see him
through a grown man's eyes and he was the

312
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:27,500
same person I remembered, but I
had to, you can't live with hate.

313
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,870
You cannot move forward.

314
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:35,180
As much as that guy tried to ruin all
of our lives, that's where I came from.

315
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,540
I had to figure out the origin
of where I started from.

316
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,660
So when I was going back through
my latch on to fix who I am,

317
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:44,060
the fucked up person,
I was like,

318
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:48,320
if your knee hurts is usually not your
fucking knee that's hurting is something

319
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:52,380
else man. Like it could be a tight quad,
it could be the right leg, his left leg,

320
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:56,850
you got to funnel to Aurizon over.
All this shit began and it was him.

321
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,490
So I had to go back to
where, you know, my,

322
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,430
my roots in the origin of all of this
happened in this hard to do that.

323
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,500
Did you make peace with them?
I'm a big piece with,

324
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,040
so we didn't have a peaceful
conversation. We, you know, we,

325
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:11,370
we left very good animal. He's
a, he's a, he's a vicious man.

326
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,060
He was a vicious man.
I mean mid evil motherfucker.

327
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,900
So I had become a medieval
motherfucker at that time.

328
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:23,700
I was 22 when I was a big boy and so I
was no longer the guy who was afraid it

329
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:26,100
was now like, Hey, I want
to kill you type of shit.

330
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:30,910
And we were sitting at Denny's after an
all night skate or whatever the hell no,

331
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,060
he owned bars and skating rinks,
shit that,

332
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:38,061
and so we were sitting down and we kinda
got into it and I was kind of left and,

333
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:40,200
but I had to make peace with it in myself.

334
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,280
I could not hold onto that hate cause
hold onto that hate was half the reason

335
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:47,190
why I kept falling into the
same pattern of failing.

336
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,430
I had to get out to start
dumping off some baggage,

337
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,870
had to start figuring out me through
him and that's all he was there for.

338
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,050
He was the origin. I had to figure
him out. I forgot why he was so evil.

339
00:18:59,051 --> 00:19:02,400
It to my mom, to me and my brother
and I to start studying him.

340
00:19:02,401 --> 00:19:06,930
Like a lot of people have situations
where someone does something and we all

341
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:10,500
attack that person. Like, like on the
media, if someone does something wrong,

342
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:14,880
everybody now is fucking perfect and we
now judge this guy. I don't judge them,

343
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:19,770
I don't judge anybody. What
I do is I started studying
them. Why did they do that?

344
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,840
Not in a judging way.

345
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:25,080
I want to learn from you and what'd you
get out of your dad? I got there. He was,

346
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:28,260
he grew up rough. He had,
he was very insecure,

347
00:19:28,261 --> 00:19:33,261
had a lot of kids and his insecurities
just trickled over on to us.

348
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,900
So yeah, he jacked us up real
good but he never fixed himself.

349
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:44,100
So if you never fix yourself, the next
person in line is going to get the wrath.

350
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:48,000
And we were next in line, you know,
his, his first wife, you know,

351
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:50,450
killed herself or whatever
happened and you know,

352
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,730
got burned up in a house or something.

353
00:19:51,731 --> 00:19:54,510
If some craziness and has lost stuff that
goes on there that I didn't put in the

354
00:19:54,511 --> 00:19:58,770
book because I don't feel like going to
court, you know? But, um, yeah. This, uh,

355
00:19:58,771 --> 00:19:59,730
it was,
it was law stuff.
