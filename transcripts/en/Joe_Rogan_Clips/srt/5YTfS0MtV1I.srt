1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,990
I take it. You like those kinds of pants?
Yeah, I love that. It's not his pants.

2
00:00:03,991 --> 00:00:05,850
This boot cuts or give
me some predictions.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,180
I'm a Ryan Bader Tko second
round grandpa first round.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,590
And Jesus said he can show respect bro.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,880
Knock him out in the first room
crying babies. Oh really? Wow.

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,850
And he's been on one tonight
though. Yeah, that'd be right.

7
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:25,220
I hate to ruin it for you.
So calm.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,250
I think if Ryan doesn't respect
for it fade or he can get cracked.

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,720
Well here's the thing about bait or too,

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,940
as much as he loved [inaudible] I'm high,
I'm so hot.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,530
Remember when he and his big fights like
you lost the rumble Johnson, John Jones,

12
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:41,880
like a lot of the big moments,

13
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:46,560
he is caught up sometimes Johnson shot
a bad shot and fucking he balanced his

14
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:47,370
head to the moon.

15
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,190
So this is the finals of their
heavyweight tournament tournament.

16
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,190
That would make Brian Bader be the
heavyweight champ champ champ champ champ

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,100
champ. He owns the light
heavyweight one right now. Yeah.

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,890
What's up John Jones trying and
run it back, Bro, those years ago.

19
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,410
Are you bringing up old shit? Is that
he says, well, you bring up old shit.

20
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,950
It's run it back. Is that what he
said? Nope. That's what I'm saying.

21
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,450
Terrible site visitors like that to lift
champ shit, right? Yeah. More. Hey Bro,

22
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,290
that song or started it now. Fucking
everyone wants to do it. Well,

23
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:19,490
there's a few guys, it gets a little
dark. I like that. I love it. Yeah, it,

24
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:24,360
it ties up the division so it gets
a little messy, but I'd love to see,

25
00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:24,661
could be,

26
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:29,661
but 70 and Woodley's go 85 is the belt
and 45 are 35 pound belt and I was going

27
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:36,150
to go out there. Here's the thing, I
really believe this. I think if some,

28
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,420
this is an egregious error and there's
a fight that stopped prematurely.

29
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,240
I think you should almost put it
up to the vote of the Internet.

30
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,480
I really do take you at your goddamn mind.

31
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,980
Bueller vote. Yes. Popular vote.

32
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:54,690
Didn't you say most people like 70%
of the pump duration of dummies? No,

33
00:01:55,090 --> 00:02:00,090
68 it's about why the fuck would
we ever want to popular vote Amy.

34
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:03,720
Okay, but let's, how
about we have and say,

35
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,250
how about we have an organization
of esteemed ladies and gentlemen,

36
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:13,380
an organization of maybe 200
accepted martial artists,

37
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,720
worldclass martial artists,
people that,

38
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:20,010
a committee of a hundred people, young
guys, what the fuck they're doing?

39
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,890
You're going to get the decision,
right? That's a great idea.

40
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,080
If you have it so much better
than the Internet. Trolls, voting,

41
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,780
John Hackleman fins and John,
Donna,

42
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:31,110
hers and for Rasa hobbies
and Duke Roof Rack Jackson,

43
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,090
Mike Winkeljohn or whichever Whitman's
and you've got a committee of the whole

44
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,120
eastern friends, friends,

45
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,040
Brian Killen and leave. You do have
something like that, Dwayne lushy fair.

46
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,680
If you have those, Tom Scurrah, Burt,

47
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,620
if you had all those people in like
a database and they all put in their

48
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:56,810
opinion, you would be 100%
probably in agreement,
especially if the experts, yeah.

49
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,420
All right, here we go. Fade
or looking, stoic. Nervous.
I'm kind of nervous. Or Ryan.

50
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,930
Well, it's scary, man. He's fighting to
fade or bro and he comes out. They get,

51
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,530
you know, as he's older, he definitely
doesn't give a fuck anymore.

52
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:12,080
He just wants to take your head off. He's
the second round hammer. My watch bro.

53
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,450
He's looking for that hammer.

54
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,200
Could that right hand feed or it's just
get that left hand loose and that right

55
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:20,750
hand balled the few fucking laughing pico
is ever going to lose again. So I've,

56
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,410
I don't know what's going to happen.
Hey man, anything could happen.

57
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,350
It's still one of the greatest
heavyweights of all time.

58
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,420
And Ryan Bader is a better fighter than
he's ever been and and really slick man.

59
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:34,990
He's smart. He's smart
and his approach. Oh.

60
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,160
Oh,

61
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,980
what's up bro?
Beautiful Shot.

62
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,250
I told you to holy shit is left Eddie,

63
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,980
but call it dude. He's got a sneaky
left. Took a turn. Done this,

64
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,870
this fucking tournament.
Oh, Chemo beat mitre.

65
00:03:57,871 --> 00:04:02,830
Own Fuck. Did I just starch fucking
fade or two? No one starts his fate or

66
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,310
luck and it was a weird left.
Took like, it was almost like a,

67
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,500
like it started out as a jab and
then I'll turn it over at the,

68
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:16,450
at Arizona state left hook, like how
rose knocked out. You are a racks.

69
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:20,140
So yes, I want to see that. Holy Shit.

70
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:23,340
Call it the top shelf gods were grabbing.
Keeps the cookies.

71
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,580
Trying to tell you guys,
you guys list top shelf a damn.

72
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,160
Look at this. Watch this.
Watch this left hand.

73
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,880
It's almost like a jab he draws,

74
00:04:33,881 --> 00:04:37,100
which she was going to it almost
like fake the single. Oh Yeah,

75
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,920
look at that again.
Being so crazy good for him.

76
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:49,030
That's a good stop. Stop.
There's two shots. Gosh,

77
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,040
that was almost like that Dan
Henderson Bisbing shot that extra shot.

78
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,370
Do you think that's add? That's
evident. Watch this again.

79
00:04:57,371 --> 00:05:00,670
Is that evidence of fader just can't take
a shot or is it a perfect punch or is

80
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:04,400
it both? Hey, there has heavy fuck.
I think it's both. I think it's,

81
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:08,650
he's also forward a little bit of that.
It's a little bit of both, but damn,

82
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:09,970
it's a perfect punch.
He,

83
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,600
he dropped his shoulder down like you
almost like he's going to jab to the body,

84
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:18,360
right? Yeah. Yeah. It looked like
almost a shot. Jeff Damn Dude five.

85
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,180
I was about to get paid. So what
happens now? He's a free agent.

86
00:05:22,181 --> 00:05:25,330
They've got to pay the cow. Look at the
heavyweight Kaos light heavyweight champ.

87
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:28,930
Hail. Shout out to be a left,
right? Shout out to Ryan Bader,

88
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,020
man. It's party. You sad to watch
fate or get cracked like that. Oh,

89
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,000
interesting. Well just cause I'm
up to date as my buddy. Listen,

90
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,720
you did call it dude, and he's texting
everybody. Twins. He's texting.

91
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:46,570
Everybody told you pitch
told you motherfuckers nice.

92
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,640
At a certain point you just can't take
shots. You get hit. That wasn't a,

93
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,580
that was a nice shop,
but it didn't appear to me.

94
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,230
You know that it was
the heaviest shot ever.

95
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,420
I hate to say I told you so to anybody,
but to young fighters,

96
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,090
this kind of shit is what I'm
always trying to point out.

97
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,760
Don't get caught up in the moment.

98
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:11,990
Don't get caught up in wars because
every one of those will, eventually,

99
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,430
there's gonna come a time when that
credit card bills going to come and you've

100
00:06:15,431 --> 00:06:18,330
got all these charges and it just,
you don't have the money.

101
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:18,910
You can have to pay it.
