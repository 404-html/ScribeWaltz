00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,320

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,350

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,750
I don't fuck you on a Monday nights.
Big Bang theory. The one before that.

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,660
How I met your mother. I did. How, you
know how I got, how I met your mother.

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,810
I didn't even know he did it. Yeah. If
you watch the episode, you're like, Joey,

10
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:38,220
you're an extra, I'm an extra. You know
why? Because I want him to the audition.

11
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:40,650
I had no underwear on and there was this,

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,370
you see these things that pop
out of chairs. Yeah. Side things.

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,200
Armrests and she goes,
get up to read. When I,

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,160
when I got up to read the fucking thing,

15
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:52,680
you got caught in the hole in
my pants and my dick came out.

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,330
All three women sat there and I go to
[inaudible] grow and then I lost them for

17
00:00:57,331 --> 00:01:00,060
sure. They even told me
they go, you got the job.

18
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,230
As I was walking down the street on Fox,
my phone rang my age. She goes, go back.

19
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:08,910
You didn't even read, I didn't even
read it. They had called. My agent said,

20
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:11,800
we love this guy.
I went back and

21
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,640
they saw the Cuban, they grow, you know,

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,260
probably not used to someone
with confidence. It didn't
give a fuck. You know,

23
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:23,790
I went to an audition one time bro, where
the guy had done, never forget this,

24
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:27,300
the guy was a white trash guy.
Like this family moved in.

25
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:32,300
It was a pilot for ABC and this
guy is one of those guys that uh,

26
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,140
he had a little circular pool in
front of his house and he was,

27
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,760
he was watering shit,

28
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:43,230
but at the same time he had
like a [inaudible] and he's
fat and he's got jewelry

29
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:45,720
on like one of those guys are like
long island. You know what I'm saying?

30
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,770
I'll never forget, I get to the audition.
All these guys are that Tony Line go,

31
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:50,800
God rest his soul.

32
00:01:50,801 --> 00:01:55,110
He's Big Italian dudes and
I knew that we're going to
get the park, bro. I'm like,

33
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:57,940
they're going to get the part. I'm not
going to get it, but I had warm ups on.

34
00:01:59,020 --> 00:01:59,480
All right.

35
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,480
I had a warmup sign with the string and
I had white tidy whities and that the

36
00:02:04,711 --> 00:02:09,000
zip up jacket and I had a way
three 80 so I walked in. I go,

37
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:13,710
I know what I'm going to do. I'm going to
take my pants off, right. I'm taking my

38
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,530
walk in and what do you think these two
ladies say to me? I hold on one second,

39
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:24,450
we'll be bit with you in a minute. So
they turn around. That's my cube bitch.

40
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,700
I took those sweat pants off.

41
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,530
I took the shoes off and my socks and I
walked closer and I took my shirt off.

42
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,560
When they turned back around,

43
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:38,250
all I had was boxer shorts on
like the tidy whities. That's it.

44
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:40,140
Ted's hanging out stomach,

45
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:43,980
hanging over the and the way they did as
soon as they turned around and they're

46
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:48,960
like, oh my God, they're like, that
is terrible. What you sure? I'm like,

47
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm not putting on shit. All right,
I'm reading this motherfucker. However.

48
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,330
So you were supposed to like wave and
say good morning and they're like action

49
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,610
and I'm, and they like can't even look
me cause I'm going to do, we make it,

50
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,570
you know,

51
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,410
and they'll can't even look at me and I'm
making believe on flipping burgers and

52
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:09,980
like look over at them. I go
live in like a doctor. That's it.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,340
They booked me when I
got through the audition.

54
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,070
That was the read live in like a doctor.

55
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:18,440
They even gave my own line of
clothes or dishes I wanted to,

56
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,010
they gave me whatever line
I said in the audition,

57
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,040
like whatever they said wasn't good
enough, go nail my own fucking line.

58
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,780
Yeah, that's, that's probably why you got
it. What does this look, look and Joey,

59
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:35,250

when you were in those big daddy shirts.

60
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,840
Yeah. Look how big I was.
Jesus Christ. You are enormous.

61
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:41,710
Back then [inaudible] it must've been
like, what, 2000 then? Right? Right. Yeah.

62
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:45,820

63
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,240
like right after my chair brought you
onto the set of news radio. Oh by name,

64
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,870

Okay.
