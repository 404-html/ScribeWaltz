1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,650
Well,
your income shit.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,380
Now I've got to find another job after I
talked about blackface. Yeah. God Damn.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,280
Megan Keller. Megan. Oh my gosh.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,750
Over and she was loving it where she was
at Fox she worked at before where she

5
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:16,440
could say all kinds of crazy shit. They
don't care about black face at Fox. Yeah.

6
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:20,100
Why can't you give her a raise, Matt?
One. Yeah, you should be able to.

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,050
You should be able to
have a bone in your nose.

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,670
And then she goes over to, was
it NBC? Why would you go there?

9
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:33,450
You know that's not for you,
dude. Apparently they did
not like her from the jump.

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,450
The inside word is that
she was not a nice person.

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,310
They did not like her to be around.

12
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:40,410
They're looking for reasons to
get rid of her. That's the word.

13
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,310
That's the inside work.

14
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,310
But don't you hate that when you hear
that someone's not nice and they're making

15
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:46,590
millions of dollars, that's true, but,

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,100
and she's not nice.
How about someone is annoying to her?

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,110
Maybe she's not a nice cause.
You're annoying.

18
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:54,690
She's out there trying to
educate people about blackface.

19
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,120
Motherfuckers tried to show her
game and she came to people.

20
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,780
Listen, it's just color.
What's the big deal?

21
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,850
Santa Claus isn't black too.
Yeah, it was awesome. Yeah.

22
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:11,480
That was a part of the extended
Megan Kelly bit that I edit down.

23
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,440
Oh, I had a guy in the office who
was working with her. I was like,

24
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:18,440
have you worked at the bank and
Kelly after like about a year?

25
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,930
You're not doing any work all day long.

26
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,620
All you're thinking of is someone
gets a fucker. Why can't it be me?

27
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,730
Like if you're in the cubicle right
there and you run into you time,

28
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,480
you time you trips to the coffee machine
when you see her walking. Not yet.

29
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,110
Not yet. Megan, just want to let you know.

30
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,330
Santa Claus definitely white. Like
you'd say, things like you more

31
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,490
horrible. That's a lot of guys,
a lot of guys working in offices.

32
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,430
You're not supposed to hit
on your coworkers. Now,

33
00:01:49,431 --> 00:01:53,990
isn't that considered a microaggression
or toxic masculinity or some of those

34
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:57,140
things, but then what if you
love her, which she loves you.

35
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,700
If it works out,
what if her husband is a jerk?

36
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:06,880
You'll take care of her
kids. Oh my God. No Way.

37
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:09,830
I can't even imagine. I mean,
I've been with Tommy for so long.

38
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,110
Oh my God,

39
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,420
this is what I think.
I think when people work together,

40
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,890
if you work together for eight hours
a day, you're spending as much,

41
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,760
if not more time with that person that
you work with every day that you do with

42
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:26,930
your spouse and you are only home like,
look,

43
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,530
if you're home in the morning,
how much do you get to see your,

44
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:33,220
your wife or your husband?
Fucking an hour,

45
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,520
two hours in the morning and most you get
up, you run into the shower, excuse me,

46
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:40,670
brush teeth when they eat breakfast and
see progress. We got going on today, blah,

47
00:02:40,671 --> 00:02:43,070
blah, blah, blah, blah. Then
we're playing basketball with
Mike, blah, blah, blah, blah,

48
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:47,150
blah. And then for eight
hours, eight hours of the day,

49
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,560
you're with some other people.

50
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,340
You don't spend eight hours flat with
anybody other than the people that you

51
00:02:52,341 --> 00:02:54,800
work with. You get home. It's what?

52
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:58,580
Seven 38 o'clock you watch TV,
you have dinner.

53
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,950
By the time it's 10

54
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,900
you're asleep. That's three hours. You
got like three hours with that person.

55
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:08,590
They were eight hours with this guy was
trying to fuck them. I know. You're right.

56
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:12,820
You're right. Because I worked
at a company I had, this guy was,

57
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,810
he ended up marrying his assistant. Ooh
Shit. But he did that thing where like,

58
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:19,030
this is my work life.
That's what they start by doing.

59
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:21,550
They break you down slowly and
they're like, this is my work wife.

60
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:26,120
This is my work husband. Ha. It's a
joke. It's a joke. It's a joke. Now

61
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,160
what happened after that was come.
Oh, that was, oh, sorry. Yeah,

62
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:40,030
because Tommy always like, I held in a
fart that whole time we were doing it.

63
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:44,170
Are you proud of me? That's
his cabin. It's real romantic,

64
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,200
but they're married now actually,

65
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,950
but that's how he courted her and
she was way out of his league.

66
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,300
She was a hot 20 something gorgeous
girl. Married. Now they have,

67
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,780
you know how many kids, I don't remember,
but what happened? How did he hit her?

68
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,960
He w he broke her, so she was dating
some guy that wouldn't call her.

69
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:04,570
It was kind of like dipping out
on her and stuff. So He'd be like,

70
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,750
I'm here for you. Let's go out after
work. Let's go get some drinks. Right.

71
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,560
It's that and your friend. I'm the guy
that's going to show up for you every day.

72
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:13,300
Dumped that guy. I'm here. I'm here.

73
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,710
Even though he's just saying he's the
work husband who's saying I can be a real

74
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:22,260
husband. Uh, yeah, yes.
Yeah. And to her you up.

75
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,600
Yeah. That's what she wanted though. She
wanted to be wiped up. Wiped up. Yeah.

76
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,800
A lot of girls want to be wiped up. Yeah.
That's great. Yeah. What would you work?

77
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,590
That's the best.
I'm an idiot.

78
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,780
Why don't I go on the road and we want
to make a living career has while your

79
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,623
craft.

80
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,650
Yeah. Right. How would,

81
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,610
it was really sad when guys wife up. I
know a guy that's wifed up, you mean?

82
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,540
Oh, when the woman takes care of
the man got all the money. We only,

83
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,321
and that's awesome.

84
00:04:53,321 --> 00:04:58,270
Like to stay home and he looks miserable
because he doesn't have any say he

85
00:04:58,271 --> 00:05:03,250
doesn't have any income. I got all
the money. So who has the money?

86
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:04,710
Has the power in the relationship.

87
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,360
She didn't even earn the money
came from the family. Fantastic.

88
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,250
They're involved too. They're always
around. I know that's not good.

89
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:15,190
And he's a weak, weak, weak. So

90
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,590
that's a dark place for a man to be.
No sovereignty,

91
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,010
no control of your existence.

92
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,960
No real financial decision making ability
because you don't bring it in he money.

93
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,930
She's scaring me right now, feeling guys.
And they settled for that. Oh, you know,

94
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,780
let's you gelled this
looking more things frame.

95
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,830
He was no really work.
Yeah, we wash it. I work.

96
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,660
You know Willman makes all the money her,
her.

97
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,740
You think that relationship
can't ever work that dynamic.

98
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,120
Does it make sense to you? Why
would it work? It's like, yeah,

99
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,970
I mean maybe the alligator
and the cat can be friends.

100
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,040
Course. That shit ain't gonna
work. It's just not going to work.

101
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,480
It will work if it's not a
real man. And, and you know,

102
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,700
and the woman likes that scenario.

103
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,450
And if the guy's just like this
spineless little cheese head,

104
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,780
I think you're, and it's
totally on PC. Yeah.

105
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,260
And I think you're right because I think
he's got to be kind of a Beta male.

106
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:22,970
He's the guy who likes his balls
busted a little bit. Maybe. Yeah,

107
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:27,530
maybe he likes his nuts squished. He
was just scared. He's just scared. Yeah.

108
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,740
You know, look, it's,

109
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,560
if you're in a relationship with someone
and that someone is a woman and she

110
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:39,100
makes far more money than you and you
just decided to let her pay all the bills,

111
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,660
that is a squirrely proposition.
It may work.

112
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,890
It's entirely possible.

113
00:06:44,891 --> 00:06:48,550
You might find the perfect woman and the
perfect man where their personalities

114
00:06:48,551 --> 00:06:50,950
gel together. Neither one of
them gives a fuck about money.

115
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,040
And yet the guy still a man
and the woman is still a woman.

116
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,410
It's just that she makes
all the money and you know,

117
00:06:56,411 --> 00:07:00,580
he kind of like does the dishes and
takes it in the ass. She pegs them,

118
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,510
she puts out a strap on,
she pisses his face.

119
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:09,880
And that's how he gets money
for food or beets or try it out.

120
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,660
Try it out. The quality. She does
whatever she wants. She smacks him.

121
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:18,010
He can't leave. It's like you think
that's what's going on? Yeah, I think so.

122
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,290
They have no power,
eh?

123
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:24,650
Well, let's see. What about Oprah and
Stedman? Stedman makes a living too,

124
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,910
like he did.
What does Steadman

125
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,030
stem is like one of those pirate beers
that you glue on at a party and everybody

126
00:07:30,031 --> 00:07:33,240
knows it's not a real beer is a good beer.

127
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,340
I didn't even know what, it never
really occurred to me. I don't really,

128
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:43,070
I don't know.
I just couldn't be together forever.

129
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,620
But could you picture opie and Pussy?
Yes,

130
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,680
1000% but I think Gail Gail for
her isn't so much a lover as a mom.

131
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,130
I don't even know Gail is. That's her
best friend. Guilty. I'm not aware.

132
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:59,360
My the loop. Come on
now. Gail. Serve her BFF.

133
00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:04,280
That's the one they think that
she's friends. No, I don't know.

134
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:09,260
I don't know. I mean, I don't possible,
that's not the case. Yeah, it's possible,

135
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,650
but they know. I don't want to assume.
Oh, she looks good there. Over a skinny.

136
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,270
I was skinny. Oprah for
all of them. Stickers.

137
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:20,180
That's one thing. Steadman is just
steady and then go. Nowhere does,

138
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,570
it doesn't even make a good living though.
It doesn't have a job

139
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,090
thing. I think Steadman does have stuff
going. Yeah. I think he's like, oh,

140
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,140
I want to say he's a lawyer or
something like that is I Google him.

141
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:33,530
It said American educator, so I
don't know. Well, here's the thing,

142
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:38,120
teacher or something. Wouldn't you say
that when someone, regardless of, uh,

143
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,790
male, female has nothing else in
life going, you know what I'm saying?

144
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:46,550
When they have no drive,
no focus, no, no goal.

145
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,060
Yeah.
That in and of itself is a bad thing.

146
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:53,450
It's a bad thing regardless of being
the man gender. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

147
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,510
People with no hobbies. Like you
don't, you don't enjoy doing anything.

148
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:01,320
Like even if it's just like reading, you
don't, you don't like doing it. Yeah,

149
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,560
I do too. But you don't let
you to do anything. You don't
want you to do anything.

150
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,080
Like you don't do anything. What
do you do? You Watch TV and eat.

151
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,890
It's a lot of people beacons though.
Yeah. Oh yeah. Beliefs. They tell jokes.

152
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,990
That's true. And when they're not telling
jokes, they watch TV and eat. Yeah.

153
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:22,370
Yeah. I used to do that a lot. We're a
fucking weird group of people, you know?

154
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,300
I mean if you really stop and
think about how odd our group is,

155
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:31,340
I'll have a little of that. I don't want
you to drink alone. There you go. Plus,

156
00:09:31,341 --> 00:09:34,130
I probably should have a little alcohol
after all the alcohol. I'd yes, yes.

157
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,820
Written 11 self help books,
Steadman bottom.

158
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,950
How to marry rich hose cope when your
wife is way more successful. How to get,

159
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,770
get some rich policy. I know, you know,

160
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,780
as feminist as I am because I
obviously I'm down for the cause.

161
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,000
What is the cause? Well,
a quality, right? Uh,

162
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,160
to the choice to have choice.
To do what the fuck you want.

163
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,960
Do you want to stay home? Raise
your kids to home, raise your kids.

164
00:09:59,961 --> 00:10:02,750
You want to go out and drive.
Well, fucking job. I agree
with that as well. Yeah.

165
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,710
Maybe I'm a feminist sound. No it,
yeah, I think you are actually a word.

166
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:10,190
I think you are. What'd you get
the ice this whole fucking time.

167
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,130
It's been right here. God dammit
it. It's a high class operation.

168
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,600
Did I put my fingers in there? Get in
there. Okay. I trust you and I know,

169
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,990
oh gosh,
but here's the deal.

170
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:29,620
You know my mother was a European
lady and as a female comic,

171
00:10:29,991 --> 00:10:33,740
I'm an Alpha in the streets,
but I'm kind of a Beta in the sheets.

172
00:10:33,741 --> 00:10:36,490
You know what I'm saying?
I like to take care of my husband.

173
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,130
I think that's why Tommy and I work
out because I like to, you know,

174
00:10:40,131 --> 00:10:44,780
I bake fucking Rice Krispie treats.
I have shit food in the house.

175
00:10:44,781 --> 00:10:46,400
I'm kind of a traditional wife.

176
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,540
Well,
you're powerful,

177
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:51,620
but you're also still a woman and
there's nothing wrong with that.

178
00:10:51,621 --> 00:10:53,030
If that's how you like to be.

179
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,300
The idea that there's something wrong
with that because you're supposed to be

180
00:10:56,301 --> 00:10:59,090
even with him.
So you supposed to be treating each other,

181
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:03,020
not like your traditional male versus
female role. Even if that's what you like,

182
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,380
that becomes a problem because it's like
a pressure problem that women will put

183
00:11:06,381 --> 00:11:10,670
on other women to behave in a different
way because they don't want to reinforce

184
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:11,900
traditional gender roles.

185
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,600
Oh, right. Yeah, sure, sure. Even if
that were role feels right to you.

186
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,660
You want to do like it. I like it.
I like taking care of my kids. Yeah,

187
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:21,690
but there's some dirty cons out there.
They'll tell you that's bad

188
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:30,180
or dirty cause angry bitches. Yes,
that's true. No, you're right.

189
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:33,450
I've had some people say stuff to
me about it and I'm like, well,

190
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:37,230
it makes me happy and if that's all that
matters and it's my choice to do that

191
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:42,090
stuff. I'm not saying I do it every night.
100% yeah. Whatever makes you happy.

192
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:43,350
As long as you know hurting anybody,

193
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,500
that's all that matters and the idea that
there's something wrong with you doing

194
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:49,500
that, like this is fucking
stupid. Yeah. It really is.

195
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:54,190
It's just stupid or silly. Or
are you about, you had that guy.

196
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:58,120
A lot of that though of what was a
lot of that stupid madness out there.

197
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,570
People telling people the way
they shouldn't, shouldn't live.

198
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,920
You know you don't have much time.
I mean,

199
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,970
you and I are halfway done, basically
almost dead when you think about it,

200
00:12:09,971 --> 00:12:13,300
when you turn 40 you were like, oh,
this is it dude. And like, yeah,

201
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:17,830
how much time you got left?
Hopefully another 30 years of good living.

202
00:12:17,831 --> 00:12:21,280
I'm saying before you really
start to break down, shit
starts falling apart. Yeah.

203
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,940
Wheels start coming off and people
are worried about dumb shit.

204
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:28,270
Like whether or not this woman
works or she should have a career.

205
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,430
She should do this. She
should. She's happy.

206
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,260
She likes eating cheese and getting
her toes done. Leave her alone. Yeah.

207
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,220
Yeah. That's funny. I think
that is a middle age revelation
though. You go like, oh,

208
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:41,890
there's only so much time left.
I don't give a fuck about all this.

209
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:43,090
Like I'm going to do me Bro.

210
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,600
The guy that I know that stuck
that's the wife makes all the money.

211
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,430
You could see it in his face,
though.

212
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,000
I could just see this a quiet anxiety.

213
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:58,840
It's like a lion at the zoo where
they're kind of broken or like,

214
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,000
you know that they're a hunter inside,

215
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,420
but you take that instinct away and they
get the meat thrown at them and they're

216
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:07,480
just like, sadly, kind of just
eat the meat off the tray.

217
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,460
It's like a Vegan cat right.
