Hello Freak bitches and IPA can
take you for a turn. Like my wife.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,960
This is like here have some odd cause
yeah, I usually come in like if I,

3
00:00:08,961 --> 00:00:10,050
if I get a little bias,

4
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:13,130
I'll come in you now and she wanted to
hang and I'm out there just just drinking

5
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:14,730
and staring at a fire and a,

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,780
she gave me this IPA called dog fish and
it's 18% alcohol and like three beers

7
00:00:20,571 --> 00:00:25,250
in. I'm like blacked out
because I was just drinking.
I'm like beers and I'm like,

8
00:00:25,251 --> 00:00:28,400
oh three beers now come in. That's
so unnecessary. And it was like,

9
00:00:28,401 --> 00:00:30,860
what do they do that to people?
I don't know. It was like,

10
00:00:30,861 --> 00:00:34,220
it's like spike in some wine. I was
like roofing is, here's the thing.

11
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,300
Like it's you can't, this is one
of my, I had a bit about this,

12
00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:40,040
about my problem and pot gummy bears.

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,240
You said one of the problems is it looks
like a regular fucking gummy bear in my

14
00:00:44,241 --> 00:00:48,500
brain thinks, oh I could just fucking
eat the shit out of those gummy bears.

15
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:49,640
I getting five or 10 of them.

16
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,690
False representation could
just Jack your world.

17
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,380
There's a video I put on Instagram of
Lisa yet. Have you seen that video?

18
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,440
One by one design,
put it up and he's got a,

19
00:01:00,441 --> 00:01:04,580
a video that they took from Joey d as
the Church of what's happening now and

20
00:01:04,581 --> 00:01:05,011
Lisa,

21
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:10,011
it is literally the physical example
that you would use if someone who's too

22
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:14,900
high. What's too hot? You like this?
This is too high. Like look at him there.

23
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:16,850
He's got his eyes closed.
Give me some volume, Jamie.

24
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:21,340
They're all talking. They're playing
some music and look at him. Look at him.

25
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,890
Look at his eyes. Fade
new now. By the way,

26
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,830
he knew he was supposed
to be at the podcasts.

27
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:28,940
Not like they woke them up
to do a podcast. He left
the camera on himself too.

28
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,810
Yeah, yeah. I love the camera
at himself and he's just,

29
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:35,680
he's so paranoid right now.
He's freaking the fuck out.

30
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,490
Fucking throws his head back. He
said, Jesus, I can't do this anymore.

31
00:01:39,491 --> 00:01:44,170
Can Work and can't work with you.
Joey Diaz.

32
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,850
He's just thinking about it now.
Demons,

33
00:01:45,851 --> 00:01:48,940
just waiting for him to close his
eyes and go to sleep. I can't,

34
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,620
I can't give to the demons.

35
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,070
You don't see them over him
just scratching at the ceiling,

36
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,060
just waiting for the lights to turn
out and his eyelids to clothes.

37
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:02,110
Am I going to go through his
fucking mouth? Penetrate his body?

38
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:06,010
And I've been that exact guy on
that exact podcast. Ooh, yeah.

39
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,990
Jay gave me the story. I just, I couldn't
handle it, man. He's a different animal.

40
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,890
I love that dude. He's the best, but he's
a different animal. You can eat, you know,

41
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:18,370
don't, don't try to outdo him
ever. I was just trying to hang,

42
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,250
he was the one that he had the
one he went, he had mercy on me,

43
00:02:21,251 --> 00:02:23,320
which I thought was
incredible cause I'm like, Yo,

44
00:02:23,321 --> 00:02:26,700
let me just grab up another little stars
death. And he's like, no way doc. Yeah,

45
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,660
you're going to fucking
try to be nice to you.

46
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,090
But like what you said about the
gummy bears, it's like, yeah.

47
00:02:31,091 --> 00:02:34,420
It's almost like the false representation
is the thing I don't like more than

48
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:35,530
the representation itself.

49
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,540
Okay.
Okay.
