1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
All right.
Anyone with 18 of anything,

2
00:00:01,621 --> 00:00:04,520
unless you're like a salt and you probably
don't have a ton anyway unless you're

3
00:00:04,521 --> 00:00:07,820
Jeff Bezos. Yeah. Well that
was uh, yeah, he could,

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,500
he could marry a hundred chicks
and give them all a billion.

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,580
That's how you still that 50
leftover. What? Yeah, he's doing good.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,960
He's doing good. But that whole thing
with him, that was an interesting thing.

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:19,771
The uh,

8
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:23,070
the pictures being leaked and it turns
out that the brother that leaked the

9
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:23,790
pictures,

10
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,700
I love the brother immediately as soon
as I read the article because I'm like,

11
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:29,460
this is Trump's daughter,
not only is a Trump supporter,

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,070
this is a guy who's tried to leverage
himself forever and he found out his hits

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,850
was fucking Jeff Paizos. Can you
imagine the night he found that out?

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,780
The night he found that out?
Where was he? What was he doing?

15
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:44,310
He was somewhere thinking,
this is it. She's fucked.

16
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:48,840
A lot of people that are good now.
She's fucking basis now. Some cash in.

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,710
Now it's time to think of something good.
How do we do it? This is a plot in guy.

18
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,510
I wonder what they inquire gave him how
much money you get for something like

19
00:00:57,511 --> 00:01:01,560
that. Half a mil. Bayzos Dick. I
want more. I want a solid mill.

20
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,440
Solid mill. You think that's kind
of the life he's going to kill you.

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,340
You think he will? If he doesn't, I'll
be disappointed. It's a good point.

22
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,700
And make it look like an accident.
If you're a fucking, you know

23
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,610
he's, he's like daddy Warbucks.
Yeah, he's the guy. He's the guy.

24
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,520
He's kind of hundreds automated.
Everything's automated.

25
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:24,570
Everything and Amazon's like
notoriously like he's an alien.

26
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:28,230
He looks like he's artificial
intelligence. He's Ai.
He has that look already.

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,810
He's super smart and he can
play it real slow. Yeah.

28
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,580
Helen slave the world and you know what?
Let him,

29
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,090
he's probably going to hire somebody
to fuck up that guy's life slowly.

30
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,930
I'm sure you're ready. Has real
slow. Oh yeah. This is your new job.

31
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,070
Your new job is to slowly make dark guys
lodash. Yeah. Everything. Everything.

32
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,520
Flat tires every day.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

33
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,870
I love the henchman that's going at
nailing flat tires. Yeah. Set up.

34
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,270
He's going to check for cameras. That's
amazing. Yeah. The at the base offices,

35
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,880
those are the new type. Like cause I
studied a lot about like Rockefeller,

36
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:04,830
Carnegie, guys like that. And those guys,

37
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:09,300
nobody say amassed a fortune of those
guys had Rockefeller had like 336 billion

38
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,560
in today's dollars. Good Lord. Yeah.
Carnegie at 372 billion. I mean these,

39
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,060
these were the first, how much
do they have in their time? Ah,

40
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,880
cause the questions and there are times,
I don't know, but in, in it was millions.

41
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:22,920
Well I don't think it was billions,
but in our time it's about,

42
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,890
it's the over 300 million. Both of them.
These were the first generation of B, B B.

43
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,180
This was the first
generation of Robert Bat.

44
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:34,110
Like the first generation
of entrepreneurs, you
know, the country was new.

45
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,930
All of these industries were just
emerging and these guys took it over.

46
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,890
Bayzos tech is, and somebody
said this on my podcast recently.

47
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:45,630
Tech is the closest thing we have now
to that where you have these, you know,

48
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,490
masters of the universe that are going
to be, I mean those guys were big.

49
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,200
Jp Morgan was like bailing
the government out.

50
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,410
These guys had an insane amount of power.
Um, they know what's really helpful.

51
00:02:55,411 --> 00:02:57,030
Really interesting
figures. Yeah. I was just,

52
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,070
when I told you I was doing this chariots,

53
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,430
the gods lunch today with a bunch of
very influential people and one of them

54
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:08,431
said it's really ironic that apple used
to be think different and that was the

55
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:12,250
whole thing about silicon valley.
Think different now.

56
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:15,040
It's don't think different right now.

57
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,070
Streamline everybody into
one acceptable thing. Yeah.

58
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:22,900
Now it is literally you have to think
the way everyone else is thinking.

59
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,290
You have to believe what everyone else
believes, even if it's ridiculous.

60
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,080
I think a lot of that is they want to
just make money and sell things and they

61
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:33,100
don't want any discord. They just
want to sell, make money. Sort of.

62
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,200
But it seems like,
I don't think,

63
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:38,080
cause they don't band people after they
do the things they banned him after.

64
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:42,140
There's a public outcry. So to me they're
not, they don't have any real value.

65
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,750
It's their values are tangible and the
values are influenced by public opinion

66
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:51,670
and where media is, the values aren't
like when somebody says something,

67
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,710
let's ban,
and right now this goes against our thing.

68
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,460
A lot of it is if you wait until
there's enough dust kicked up,

69
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:00,820
then they will ban somebody.
Right. That's true. So to me,

70
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,790
I get in arguments with friends when
they're like their ideological, I'm like,

71
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,590
they have an ideological bet certainly.

72
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,450
But the profit seeking enterprises
that just want everyone to be happy.

73
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,720
I think if it was up to Twitter, every
tweet would be some type of branded ad.

74
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,250
And on top of that,

75
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,280
now the ideology is skewing and leaning
in that direction in terms of like tech

76
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:24,400
and sure, there's money in that.
There's money in holding that line.

77
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:29,460
And those guys are the ones that are as
powerful as Rockefeller and Carnegie and

78
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,440
JP, like all, all of those guys,
they are the next, you know,

79
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,910
generation of people who will,
their amount of power is,

80
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,980
is unmatched anywhere in society.
