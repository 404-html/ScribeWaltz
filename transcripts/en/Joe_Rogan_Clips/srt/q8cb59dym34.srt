1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,150
Do you have apprehension about the
horsepower wars with just modern consumer

2
00:00:06,151 --> 00:00:06,890
cars?

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,200
Cause I look at some of these cars that
they're putting out that are amazing.

4
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:14,190
Like the new corvette Zr one,
right? 700 plus horsepower,

5
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:18,270
right from the factory. The dodge
demons, like 800 horsepower.

6
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:21,850
Like they're putting out
these insane race cars. Yeah.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,280
Right from the factory that any dummy
like me, I could just go to a stiff,

8
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:27,180
I have the cash,

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,110
I go to a corvette dealership and pick
one up and all of a sudden I'm on the

10
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:33,240
highway. Yeah. Yeah. I don't,

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,590
I don't have a problem with it now until
it becomes a common occurrence where

12
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:39,200
people don't know how to control,
you know,

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,210
hitting no know how to manage what they're
doing behind the wheel of something

14
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:45,750
like that. But until, until
that's like a common issue.

15
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:50,730
I don't know that it'll need regulation.
Yeah. Yeah. I don't necessarily think,

16
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,610
I wouldn't be surprised though
that one day maybe, you know,

17
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,160
regulated because everything
gets, you know, governance. Yeah.

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,230
Maybe too much.
Right.

19
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,940
Maybe we should just appreciate the
fact that you can do that. I know.

20
00:01:03,941 --> 00:01:07,460
I mean I want to be able to build
whatever I want to build. Right. You know,

21
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,980
if I want that, then production ought to
be able to produce whatever they want.

22
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:15,300
I agree. But I feel like I feel
at the same way I feel about guns,

23
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,880
like I'm very pro second
amendment. I feel like, uh,

24
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,060
I am a responsible gun owner.

25
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:23,340
I didn't have a lot of friends
that are responsible gun owners.

26
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:26,760
I've used guns for hunting. I think
you should have a gun for protection.

27
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:27,990
I don't think there's
anything wrong with that,

28
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,280
but I don't think it would be a bad idea
to have some sort of course that you

29
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:32,850
have to go through.

30
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,850
So you understand all the aspects of
safety and precautions you should take and

31
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,240
how to correctly load a gun and
clean and gun. Absolutely. Yeah.

32
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,180
But this is not really the case right
now, you know, and it's not necessarily,

33
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:48,980
I'm not talking about gun control as
much as I'm talking about gun safety and

34
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,170
gun responsibility. I feel like
the same way about car. Yeah.

35
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,830
I feel like if you're going to
go out and buy a corvette zr one,

36
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:59,490
I mean the kind of body
mashing acceleration,

37
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:02,520
the g forces you can get from something
like that right from the factory,

38
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:06,420
zero to 60 in under three seconds.
That's an insane automobile.

39
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,360
Like maybe someone she's like take
you around a track a little bit.

40
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,150
That's a great idea.
I guess that would be the case.

41
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:14,730
If you were going to buy something
like that or getting a car like that,

42
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:16,470
you would need some kind
of a trainer course.

43
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,140
Then you'd have to pass three
hours on a track. If you're,

44
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:23,760
if you have to have particular license
to drive 18 wheelers down the interstate,

45
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,410
you know there should be a style or a
type of license that you need to achieve

46
00:02:28,411 --> 00:02:30,510
to have a certain type of,
you know,

47
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,870
you want to go buy a viper
ACR and take it on the road.

48
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:36,390
Those crazy race car vipers,
you could just drive.

49
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,070
She probably know how to drive lifer.
Yeah. Those things are a little handful.

50
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,050
There's their little tail happy. They're
pretty dealer. They're so crazy too,

51
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:49,230
that the race car one with all the
events and all the Arrow all around it,

52
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,290
that was just an insane thing that you
could just go buy that and take that on

53
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:56,850
the road. No giant as v 10 in it.
It's pretty crazy. It's awesome.

54
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,340
Yeah.
