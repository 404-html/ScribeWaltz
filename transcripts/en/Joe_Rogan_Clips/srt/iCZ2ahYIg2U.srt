1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,000
I think that it's um, give me some
advice. I don't know enough about it.

2
00:00:03,001 --> 00:00:03,834
I'm an idiot.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,260
I just on anything on anything money
related cause you have an icon jeep so I

4
00:00:07,261 --> 00:00:10,470
know you have more money.
I just work a lot.

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,340
We'll such grandfather leaves. That's
true. That's the shit. My grandfather,

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,820
I'm not a big, I'm not a big investor.
I'm not very smart. I got you.

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,330
I have people handling that kind of stuff,

8
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:25,410
which you don't work a lot but I don't
pay attention to anything guilty now.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:25,950
Yeah.

10
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,420
I do too many things myself to the place
where I know exactly what I have to pay

11
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:31,640
attention to them.
What I don't want,

12
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:33,870
I don't have to pay attention
to is just gone shot.

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,270
Robert Paul lay my accountant
has made it pretty easy for me.

14
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:39,180
He is literally a graph.
This is a dollar you make.

15
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,420
This is what goes into savings.
This is what goes into advancement.

16
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:44,520
This is what you and Shay
weren't invested in real estate.

17
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,450
This is for retirement. So now everything
that comes in and I already know.

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,090
So it's like when they call us until like,
hey you guys,

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,040
you guys got a $500,000 a day.

20
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:56,430
I just know that I'm not going home
with two 50 because asset management

21
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:59,010
conditions, my wife and my accounting
already chop that shit up. So

22
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,530
I got enough money to buy a Camaro.
Yeah,

23
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,450
I don't like to think about that.

24
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,550
I had just to think about now cause
you know I'm black and you know shit,

25
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:14,340
I ain't been too good if you like,
but it got my live view poor and black.

26
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,880
If you pour America's fucked up.
Yeah. If you pour in black Americans,

27
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:20,790
fuck that with a deal during ass.
So you know, my whole shit is,

28
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,270
let me take care of my money because
my grandpa and my grandmother,

29
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,540
her family owned land,
they started as sharecroppers,

30
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:29,430
but because they are land she could,

31
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,130
she could become educated because
they could sail the stuff.

32
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:36,120
They grew to stores and produce markets
and stuff. So she named were Methodist.

33
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:40,650
So she got to go to school. My
grandfather, some other old no land.

34
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,450
So my grandfather had to work in a
bread factory in cotton meals and shit.

35
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:50,340
So I knew the difference
between ownership and you know,

36
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:52,290
the advantages of having something in it.

37
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,820
So it's something I can have obsessed
on because I don't want my children to

38
00:01:56,821 --> 00:02:01,170
endure poverty. And I, and I grew
up working class, you know, my wife,

39
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,880
she jokes, but she said
to the lot, you know,

40
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:06,570
she was from housing projects in Savannah
and her grandmother and her mother

41
00:02:06,571 --> 00:02:09,570
worked. They were out of there. But you
know, she says to me, me all the time,

42
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:11,760
you were spoiled. You know, you're
a little rich kids. I'm like,

43
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:13,860
what are you talking about? She's
like, you had a fucking RV. I'm like,

44
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:17,460
I lived in an a frame house. She's
like, I don't care. Your Grandpa,

45
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,860
your grandparents couldn't afford a RV.
You guys went on vacation.

46
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,450
You were spoiled. Right? So I
understand money means a lot,

47
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,160
and it doesn't mean everything to me,

48
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,310
but it helps to afford me to be able
to take care of her. My children,

49
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,240
I completely understand it,
but I don't really give a shit.

50
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,760
Knock on a daily basis. I'm
more like you, I just you,

51
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:37,260
but you think about businesses,

52
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:39,450
you think about starting
businesses and forming businesses.

53
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,020
How do you have the time to do that and
write and perform and all the other shit

54
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:47,260
that you do? Because it enabled the
business is enabled me to enjoy writing.

55
00:02:47,261 --> 00:02:51,810
They're performing. When I had to
wrap, when it was no choice, um, it,

56
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,520
it wasn't as fun anymore because the
pressure was, am I going to chart,

57
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,340
can I make this much? Will
the record versus, you know,

58
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:03,270
if I have a couple of shaves in
revenue coming in, you know, it,

59
00:03:03,271 --> 00:03:07,910
it makes it a little more relaxed and
my art is freer that way, you know?

60
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,520
Ooh, I like that answer. That's
a great answer. That makes sense.

61
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,620
That makes a lot of sense actually.
Yeah.

62
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:17,500
To free yourself up creatively so that
all you have to think about when you're

63
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:21,250
doing that, you're just doing
what you want to do. Yeah.
That's it. Yeah. That's it.

64
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,500
Yeah, man, that's ideal. That's wise.
That's the goal. Yeah. If I'm a, you know,

65
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:29,770
a lot of people talk a lot of shit about
billionaires they like and they want to

66
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:30,950
be,
and then Daryl,

67
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,720
there are tons of billionaires from the
nerdy sexy or Bill Gates to the wild,

68
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,460
dope, eccentric, sexy of Eli Musk to
the ogs of Warren Buffett and shit.

69
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:44,230
I like Ted Turner, Ted Turner as
well. Ted was the guy who got nine,

70
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,260
got snookered out of six, ended up
with one or two and it's like, man,

71
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:49,870
I'm living in my fucking life
growing bice and eating good meat.

72
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,770
Where's the fucking cowboy hat with
my funky mustache? And like he's,

73
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:58,110
he was such a good owner of teams and
our city, when he owned the teams,

74
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,500
he was a great man with TBS and he did a
lot of good. He's, if you know, if I, if,

75
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,110
if, if a billion is the new
style, I want to be a billionaire,

76
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,140
but of having a lot of money's a standard,
I'd like to be the quirky,

77
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:13,120
eccentric guy. Like Ted, he
always seemed free to me. Yeah.

78
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,750
Especially once you got rid of Jane
Fonda that shouts out to listen.

79
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:22,630
When he married Jane Fonda the south,
where we literally thought it was, oh man,

80
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,510
it was like the city of Atlanta had
went back to gone with the wind.

81
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,590
It was just amazing. Again, it was,
people were strutting around that,

82
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:33,300
you know Jane Fonda's virtual, our first
lady, well you know, if he will start to,

83
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,050
but I choose a nice lady to the city.

84
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,650
David Justice and highly
Barry were interesting too.

85
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,920
Not an interest in is to some bastard.
He was hands one motherfucking the world.

86
00:04:43,921 --> 00:04:46,810
Was it? What's the, um, what's the
yachting if anyone, I don't know,

87
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,673
the Yada he who's,

88
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,760
he got into Yachty and out of nowhere
because cup the America's cup was it,

89
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,493
was that right?
Yeah.

90
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,250
Ted Turner lived a life that
Ralph Lauren puts on tee shirts.

91
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,830
Yeah. He looks like a, like a
billionaire and a movie too.

92
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,800
He does great Gatsby tie.
He does.

93
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,020
He does some guy who's a wise billionaire.

94
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:11,290
It brings you into this study and you
have a scotch with him on ice. Exactly.

95
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:15,340
Explain Shit to you. And you're like, what
in the fuck? Shouts out to tay it man.

96
00:05:15,341 --> 00:05:18,850
I know you don't get your love like
a lot of the other guys. The cut,

97
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,540
he does the fucking Montana ground bison.
He's out there chilling man.

98
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:26,860
We bound it. The population of Bison
so he could cook them and eat them.

99
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,410
It's like get the fuck out of here.
That's bad ass man. But those overalls,

100
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,230
respect. That's how my fucking grandfather
dressed with the same mustache.

101
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,970
That's what I want to be like when I
think about making 21 million escaping the

102
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:44,560
game and shit. This is me like maybe
overalls in a Braves cap, but this is it.

103
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,760
Now let me ask you this,

104
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:50,050
how far away from him are dudes
with machine guns at all times,

105
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,090
but he's in fucking Montana but so what?
I can drive to Montana stick.

106
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,530
He'll take turn tenant who wants to
come in? No one wants to kill Turner.

107
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,920
She get some money, Bro. No one wants to
kill. I would imagine she has two snipers.

108
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,110
He probably has. He probably has
two snipers say east and west,

109
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:09,500
and he has one guy within a few
feet of him, but very relaxed.

110
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,480
I don't think teds walking
around like Kadafi.
