1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,430
I was in,
Oh shit.

2
00:00:02,431 --> 00:00:05,880
For Breezy over doom got flat and he
was just going to fight in Russia,

3
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:10,170
I think against all neck. Yeah, yeah, Yup.
Well that's not happening. It's a wrap.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,690
That's a wrap on that.
Well,

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,540
he's 40 years old trying to him to
compete in something that's a young man's

6
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:18,540
game. That's the thing.
It's like you can get mad,

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,730
you can get outraged and
that's a reasonable result
are reasonable response if

8
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:25,890
you want. But if you
rationalize, if you have empathy,

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,460
it's like this guy still wants to do this
thing that his body won't allow him to

10
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:33,330
do and so he's willing to,
to bend the rules to attempt it.

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,410
He failed and now he's going to
have to pay the consequences. Yeah.

12
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:40,470
It's a month after his knock
out. Lost a Volkov. Right.

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,710
Volkov fuck to mom.
Dangerous there guys.

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,710
Fucking dangerous be a long tall knockout
artist to heavyweight thing is a whole

15
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:50,970
other thing. I hold the thing, man.

16
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,810
And when you get these seven footers
that can kick ass like Volkov.

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,010
That's a fucking nightmare. What does he
like? He's at least six 11 right? Scary.

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,380
He's a big guys bigger than than for
doing by a, lots of call it six, six, six,

19
00:01:04,381 --> 00:01:08,000
seven, somewhere in that range.
Right. For Dumas, let's six four,

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,571
somewhere around that.

21
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:14,250
And have you ever met Brett Rogers
who's Brett Rogers and now Brett Rodgers

22
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,230
fought? Uh, uh, Brett Grim
Rogers, yeah. Yeah. Was a fire.

23
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,560
That guy, that's the biggest
person I've ever met. Really? Yeah.

24
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:25,020
Like I don't know what
it was about his frame,

25
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:29,100
but I was trying to interview and it's
only six, nine or six, eight or something.

26
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:33,270
But it was the physical frame of him
and I was just like, it was so wild.

27
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,810
It's a triple h and a restaurant one time
and I was like, whoa, like giant dude.

28
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,200
He's big,
big athletes like this.

29
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:44,460
Like what the force that they can
generate like in Gannon, that ability to,

30
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,850
to create that type of power and impact.

31
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:51,630
This is a crazy picture of Afghanistan
and extra professional basketball player

32
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,460
and a god who looks like a tiny person.
So weird. It got who it looks like.

33
00:01:56,461 --> 00:02:00,090
I look when I stand next to him.
Not quite as much contrast,

34
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:03,810
but pretty ridiculous, but there it
is. Look at that. That's, I mean,

35
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:08,190
that's fucking crazy. We just,
there's, there's more always,

36
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,140
but I have a Chihuahua and a
Chihuahua, and you have your, your doc,

37
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,180
you put them beside each other and you're
like, that can't be the same species.

38
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:18,660
I know. It's weird. Right? Then humans
are just like dogs and that way, you know,

39
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:20,730
we vary so wildly in her size.
