1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:06,210
Gear. It doesn't give you that
part, you know? Yeah. What was the,

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,170
um, so you had gone through
a series of ketamine therapy.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,440
Yeah, I did. Uh, I did the tms. The uh,

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,940
cause I was looking to at the last time
was here was this alliance, Dermal Mag,

5
00:00:18,941 --> 00:00:23,110
transcranial magnetic stimulation
and which worked that men,

6
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,500
the problem was, and I think, I don't
know if I talked about on here or not,

7
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:31,680
I h someone gave me some HGH. Did they
tell you that human growth hormone? Yeah,

8
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,860
basically.
So I did tms,

9
00:00:35,861 --> 00:00:39,880
which transcranial magnetic stimulation,
45 sessions. It worked great.

10
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,890
Like it literally stopped taking,

11
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:46,891
it takes like 35 minutes and they just
put like electrodes on you are so I think

12
00:00:47,021 --> 00:00:51,290
I have video. Um, they
put, uh, they put, um,

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,150
they, yeah, they put video on, uh,

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,610
looking,
Chris rock t sends me every single uh,

15
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,400
uh,
rape thing.

16
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,400
Oh my God. Everything that
comes out, every sink,

17
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:11,290
every page six f literally he
sent me 25 of these. I don't know.

18
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:15,030
It's just like a thing now because
then we go like, I just like literally,

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,530
it's just like a tick.

20
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,590
So for the morning there's
so many guys not real Batali.

21
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,310
And by the way, the more salacious they
can make these stories, the better.

22
00:01:24,311 --> 00:01:27,280
They were talking about some room that
Mario would take people up to and the

23
00:01:27,281 --> 00:01:29,020
third floor was the rape room.
I'm like,

24
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,180
what in the fuck off me
laugh is the SEO habit.

25
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:35,250
Yeah. The uh, you know what
makes me laugh is the, um,

26
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,610
the pictures of Louis got
progressively worse and worse.

27
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,780
Oh, the ones that get fined
like the New York Times,

28
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,150
I was waiting for them to just put up
a picture of Lee Harvey Oswald fucking

29
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,560
hits. You don't have to find
the shittiest, the guilty
is looking picture of this.

30
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,780
So much video of him beating
off air, beating on, you know,

31
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,220
play that video like this.
This is the last time

32
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,860
was here or this is unlined? Yes.
From last time you were here. Yeah.

33
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,810
Wow. Look at that, man.
Give me some volume. If I am
talking about, I went to this,

34
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:15,240
whoa dude,
that sound is like an Mri.

35
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:18,030
So it's an APP. That's what
it is. Yes, that's right.

36
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:22,160
We talked about last week right
here. Um, the uh, but uh, case.

37
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,220
So then the problem was after that I did
HGH for someone gave me some HGH and I

38
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:28,320
was like, yeah, I'll fucking take you.
I don't want to give a shit. Yeah,

39
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:31,050
I'll take HGH.
I'm always looking for an advantage.

40
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,910
And I started having panic attacks
from Hga. Yes. Which is a, we,

41
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:40,380
it's a narrow side effect, but it's one
of the side effects of HGH. Basically.

42
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:45,360
It like supercharged my whole system.
I started having panic attacks on stage.

43
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,450
I had a panic attack the night before.
I take three mikes.

44
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,870
Why couldn't go onstage?

45
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,890
Spade was supposed to bring me on and
I told Adam, I was like, I can't go on.

46
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,420
I literally couldn't breathe.

47
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,010
Wow.
The night before you

48
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,870
fell? Thankfully, yes.

49
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,350
I thankfully didn't get one that
night. Like, oh my God, dude, trust me,

50
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:13,570
trust me. And then I, and
then I had anxiety for months.

51
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,130
Literally like, just like when people say
I have anxiety, I had never had anxiety.

52
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,800
I was like, I'm not an anxious person
and wouldn't even know what that's like.

53
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,920
It's fucking miserable.
It's,

54
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:29,310
to me it was worse than depression
because you're agitated and like,

55
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:34,990
you just feel like static. It just was
like a static over your body. It was like,

56
00:03:34,991 --> 00:03:38,470
you're, you just have
like this, like cortisol,

57
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,810
snow in your, and it
sucked. So I went back on a,

58
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,630
on a Zoloft, um, to, and then it ended the

59
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,090
anxiety now. But you were trying
to get yourself off of it.

60
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,260
Yeah. So now I'm going
to go, I'm, I'm back.

61
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,280
I just stopped taking Zoloft for like
two weeks ago. How did you can't,

62
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,670
I feel actually really good because,
oh, here's what I didn't say.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,980
I also micro dosed do,
uh, while I was on Zoloft,

64
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,240
I microdose shrooms, uh, like three times,

65
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,770
which is actually like pretty fun.
It's Super Fun,

66
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,440
but it's like not daunting. It's not,
you're not like, it's not trippy,

67
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,860
right? You're not like, oh
yeah, you just feel good. Uh,

68
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,530
I did that three times a did
LSD once and I, I'm thinking of,

69
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,090
so now I'm going off and,

70
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,280
and interesting happened when I microdose
I got significantly less angry just as

71
00:04:39,271 --> 00:04:43,560
like an operating principle. Like I
was just like, oh, I'm less angry.

72
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:48,100
Like I just didn't feel as
like snappy and shitty. Um,

73
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,450
like for a long,

74
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,110
for like an like an over big period.

75
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,010
I've got a buddy of mine who's a world
champion kickboxer remind her doses and

76
00:04:57,011 --> 00:05:01,690
he fights on it fights high on mushrooms.
Do they test for it or are they,

77
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:05,320
it's just, nope, that's fine. I fucking
people up while he's on mushrooms.

78
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,290
That's great. And I mean better
than he's ever looked in his past.

79
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,180
He said he could see things
coming before they happen. Yup.

80
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:14,170
He said he'd literally feels like he's
got some sort of psychic ability when

81
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:17,320
he's sparring. Like he sees what guys
are doing and if you watch him fight,

82
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:20,740
he just looks way sharper than
he's ever looked before at home.

83
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:21,910
Boys doing mushrooms.

84
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,210
Yeah. Then that's the, so I've been,

85
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,200
I stopped taking it all
off because you can't, uh,

86
00:05:28,201 --> 00:05:32,060
you can't be on it. And
do I have a game? Uh,

87
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,100
you can, uh, you risk serotonin syndrome,

88
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:38,890
which is like it too much serotonin in
your body or Nah. Yeah. Yeah. And so

89
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,910
were the first guy that tell me about
five HTP before we even started selling it

90
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:46,010
and all that before we
started having a mood,

91
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,580
you were telling me about five HTP
and that you were at Sandy Anto

92
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,850
told me about no shit. Yeah. Cause I,

93
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:55,690
he saw me some ecstasy and he was like,
yeah,

94
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:59,990
and also take the next day and I was
like Mongo and then I like research and I

95
00:05:59,991 --> 00:06:03,250
was like, oh, I should just take.
So I still take that five inch.

96
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,680
I think it's good for
weight loss. Really. Um,

97
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,600
it like when I take five
HDP, I'm just not hungry. Um,

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,980
it like that was the other sort of
weird side effect of the micro dosing.

99
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:21,010
My appetite went down like
significantly across the board.

100
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,280
Wonder how much of the appetite is
not really how much food you need.

101
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,690
But rather you need something
to do. Yeah. Or it's just like,

102
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,800
at this time of day I do this.
Um,

103
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,970
but I ended up like losing 10 pounds.
That's interesting to me.

104
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,780
Like one 50 from,

105
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,380
I've lost 12 pounds from like
one 59 to one 47. Wow. Yeah.

106
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:50,390
But it's not like a, not starving
myself or anything. Right.

107
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:55,190
So you didn't feel uncomfortable? No,
not at all. He was like, yeah. Yeah.

108
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,190
Do you monitor your diet? Are you,
do, are you eating healthy? Yeah.

109
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:04,010
Like I got my blood tested probably
three months ago and everything was good.

110
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,720
Do you, are you eating sugar and
bread and things like I've eaten,

111
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,530
I've stopped. Uh, I've eaten.

112
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,640
I used to be a big dessert
person and I kind of just like,

113
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:20,570
I think the mushrooms might've
maybe just kind of like, Eh, you,

114
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:24,050
I think that you don't, um,
and don't sugar, you know,

115
00:07:24,051 --> 00:07:26,360
the thing with sugar is you don't need
it for three days if you don't want it.

116
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,950
Right. Like you just, your
body doesn't like, you got
to fucking get us some sugar.

117
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:35,060
You're just like, Eh, I'm
good. Once you cut free. Yeah,

118
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,690
and especially if you're really conscious
about what you're eating in terms of

119
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:43,460
like probiotics and things that
sort of help the landscape,

120
00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:47,450
the biome landscape and make sure
you've got healthy things in there.

121
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:52,430
I think that's so significant in the
more researchers that I talked to and the

122
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:57,431
more people that are nutrition experts
to start talking about your gut biome and

123
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,650
how important it is to
take the proper probiotics.

124
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,920
I think it affects your personality.
I think it affects your immune system.

125
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:08,630
I think it affects virtually the path of
your life that you take depending upon

126
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:12,350
what foods you eat. It has a different
effect on how you live your life.

127
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:12,741
Well that's,

128
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:16,260
meditation does the same thing cause
you're like you get a feeling for

129
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:18,860
meditation and then you're like,

130
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:24,070
do I want to spoil this with like garbage
thinking or behavior like running?

131
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:28,850
Just try to bring a bit of that
in know in my every day. Yeah.

132
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,070
I mean that's the tank for me.
Yeah.

133
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,160
The tank is literally forgot about tanks
until you and I'm like I live like a

134
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:42,110
block from float lab. You got
to go like I, I went, I went.

135
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,540
I think you must.
How long have you been doing this?

136
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,530
2002 was the first time I got one.

137
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:54,200
When did you start doing the podcast?
I think you told me about it.

138
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,860
You told me about it.
I went to float lab.

139
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,230
Had the thought in the, in the
tank. You got to love something.

140
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,500
Literally that was the thought.
I had an and then I got a dog.

141
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,050
Literally like he's always like,
I fucking like that,

142
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:16,930
that I like that shit.
Like and I just forget that it exists.

143
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,740
The tanks? Yeah, I think they're
giant. I think it's like one of them.

144
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:24,010
It's one of those things that requires
you to block off a chunk of your time,

145
00:09:24,011 --> 00:09:26,830
so if you're a busy person it's hard to,
it's hard to pull it off,

146
00:09:26,831 --> 00:09:28,840
but I think it's like one of the
most important things you could do.

147
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,400
How often are you doing?
Well,

148
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:34,270
I haven't done in a long time because
I took the one out of my basement and I

149
00:09:34,271 --> 00:09:37,150
had it installed here.
It took me a few,

150
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,940
few times off and we just
got to put in two days ago.

151
00:09:39,941 --> 00:09:44,260
So I haven't even been in it. So I haven't
been a tank at all and three months.

152
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,780
Oh Wow. Two months, two
months, something like that.

153
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,630
How often do you think you'll do it now?
A couple of days a week.

154
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,080
A couple of days a week is good. If I can
give myself two days a week, I'm happy.

155
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:57,820
Do you ever go in and just think
about your daughters? Yeah,

156
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,410
sure. Yeah. Yeah. So it's
not, I don't like have a plan.

157
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:03,940
Sometimes I have a plan,

158
00:10:03,941 --> 00:10:07,570
like maybe I'll have a bit and I'm trying
to work out and I just like this bed.

159
00:10:07,571 --> 00:10:09,850
It's just clunky.
There's a part of it that's clunky.

160
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,740
I'll smoke some pot and climbing that
tank and think about it. There's a

161
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:18,080
in the, in the, the, there's like a pre

162
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:24,830
fucking syllabus for the Ibogaine and
it's like you need to come with questions.

163
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:32,090
Ooh for Ibogaine. Well for
sweet lady Ibogaine. Whoa.

164
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,330
And it's like I have to write.
And then a friend of mine was like,

165
00:10:35,331 --> 00:10:39,860
can you ask a question for me? It's
like, no, I don't think that's legal.

166
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:44,520
Okay. So where Lucy needs,

167
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,530
it's about what's going on with her feet,

168
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:56,700
but I'm like looking forward to asking,
asking big questions.

169
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,570
Although I gotta say the last year has
been very revealing for me in terms of

170
00:11:00,571 --> 00:11:02,100
like what,
what's important.
