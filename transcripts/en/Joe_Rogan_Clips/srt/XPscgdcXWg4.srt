1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,510
Because with a lot of people they take
time off and then they come back and you

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,470
wonder what they're going to look like.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,820
But one of the things that I was very
hopeful with you is that you've always

4
00:00:10,821 --> 00:00:15,821
been almost a martial artist first and
a fighter second and that you're always

5
00:00:17,331 --> 00:00:19,810
learning and you're always
practicing. Like you, you,

6
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:23,300
you would always take time in between
camps and you would, you know,

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,590
do Jujitsu in Brazil or you would be
constantly practicing your Moitai.

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,870
You're always trying to
learn and improve your game.

9
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,560
And I was thinking when you came back it
was like if you were saying that you're

10
00:00:33,561 --> 00:00:37,240
a better than ever, I'm like man, he
might be better than ever. Like you,

11
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,940
you are willing to one guy that I believed
because a lot of times guys come back

12
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:44,090
and like man he's been out
of the game a long time.

13
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,680
Who knows how hard he's been training.

14
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:48,410
Cause a lot of fighters
when they're not in camp,

15
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,480
when they're not preparing for a fight,
they don't,

16
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,510
they don't like to train that
much cause they, they the, the,

17
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,390
the grind of camp almost.
Whereas I'm like,

18
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,330
you know how you see a lot of fighters
after they retire, they get really fat.

19
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,610
Yeah. And you're like,
wow, how could he get fat?

20
00:01:01,611 --> 00:01:05,570
Like I was looking at my Donna the other
day, there's a picture of my Donna's um,

21
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,790
uh, Chino, Mondo. Dot. Madonna. He's
got a Instagram page. He's fat as fuck.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,140
He's got a cigar.

23
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,590
He's drinking a whiskey mean he just
fought Floyd Mayweather a couple of years

24
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,270
ago.
He was ripped and this,

25
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,130
they retire and they don't
give a fuck anymore though.

26
00:01:19,131 --> 00:01:21,050
I don't want to do this anymore.
But you,

27
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,370
I knew you were still training cause
I would see like an Henzel Gracie.

28
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,680
But the guys who were
training with you there,

29
00:01:27,681 --> 00:01:29,540
and I knew you were
training with Donna her,

30
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:33,500
I knew you were constantly training
and you look good. So I was like at,

31
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,870
when I left off, like more
than four years ago, I, uh,

32
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,870
I knew I wanted it to come back.
Uh, the guy was not in an APP.

33
00:01:40,871 --> 00:01:45,871
He place had a lot of personal problems
and I should have even stopped earlier

34
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,100
then after my fight with Hendrix.
If, if I would have stopped earlier,

35
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,120
I would have maybe come back
earlier as well. Uh, it was,

36
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:55,943
I was,

37
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,530
I felt like I was like kind of a feeling
of a cluster claustrophobic feeling,

38
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:04,790
you know, like it, I was, I couldn't
breathe well. I couldn't sleep well. I,

39
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:09,240
in my mind eye too much pressure or
personal property. There's so much stuff,

40
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,440
a lot of stuff happened to me that it's
still too early in my life and for the

41
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:16,050
respect of some people I know
I couldn't talk about it.

42
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,870
One day I will all mixed together.

43
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:23,700
I knew it was a drug issue in
the sport. I feel, I felt it.

44
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,680
I did feel well and uh,

45
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:30,681
I was trying to perform
under those condition and it
was catching up to me and,

46
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,220
um,
I did it.

47
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,650
But the reason why I think I didn't
lose the edge is a lot of people,

48
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:39,510
because we do an extreme sport,

49
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,810
it's like what we do is kind
of a life and death situation.

50
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:46,380
It's not because there's a referee,

51
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:51,381
but the spirit is the same as a glazer
gladiator or a person in the war that

52
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:54,780
goes toward, he thinks he's
going to die, is the same spirit,

53
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:55,760
even though it's not as anything.

54
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,770
But we'll go over there and the same
spirit that we're ready to give it or give

55
00:02:58,771 --> 00:03:03,771
it all is such an extreme
feeling that wants,

56
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:08,170
you don't have that in your life.
Life kind of become boring.

57
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,430
You feel like you're not alive anymore.
So that's why when people stop,

58
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,950
they retired and I tried to come back.

59
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:18,760
A lot of the people they fall into drugs
because I want to catch up to that.

60
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,770
They want to feel alive again.
So they want,

61
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:24,460
they need that sensation
that they add previously,

62
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:29,850
but a couldn't get it back unless they
do drugs or they do something crazy

63
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:35,050
extravagant. The thing with me is
I knew I was going to come back.

64
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,010
Uh, and also I always like to
train and keep myself in shape and,

65
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,790
and I never did drugs. You know, like
I never did the other drugs. I drink,

66
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,100
I drink sometimes for my birthday.

67
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:48,760
Last Saturday I went out and I was
completely wasted. Okay. It is what it is.

68
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:52,840
I like to data rate myself sometime I'm
not perfect. Just have a little fun.

69
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,220
Exactly. And I, what's the goal of doing
this? If you're not enjoying your life,

70
00:03:57,221 --> 00:04:00,070
what's the goal of it? Right. And
know people to fight. It's like, no,

71
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:00,910
I don't like to fight.

72
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,830
And that is another thing I like to talk
to you about people's eye and why you

73
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:09,220
do that if you don't like to fight. And
it's like, because I like my lifestyle,

74
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:11,590
you know, that it gives
me, but that's why people,

75
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:15,880
I believe if we come back to what you
would say, that's why I think people,

76
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:19,000
they have our time to come back after so
many years because they fall into that

77
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:21,570
trap.
They need to feel alive so they,

78
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,230
they find ways to that them in,
make them feel alive. But it's the,

79
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,520
it's the interior.
They tell your rate themselves denied the,

80
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,310
I didn't do that. I did not do that and
I would never will. Hopefully I can.

81
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,530
It's not my thing, you know? So
when you decided to come back,

82
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:43,240
how far out did you decide? Like, but
you, you, you took four years off. Yeah.

83
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,750
How many years in where you were like,
I think I'm ready to come back.

84
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:48,910
Uh,

85
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,910
when I see USA USA DEA and the drug
testing program being implemented and

86
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,970
implemented, then I saw a lot
of, a lot of about deflate. Yes.

87
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,780
A lot of dedicated.
Huh?

88
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,040
Like did you feel vindicated when you
saw like some of these people just,

89
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,990
I feel a little bit of a, I mean, it,

90
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:13,050
it feels bad to wish people bad luck
to get some kind of recognition,

91
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:16,330
but that's not what I want. I want
to do. I don't wish people bad luck,

92
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:21,070
but if you cheat, you cheat man. And they,
a lot of people get cut. And finally,

93
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,560
a lot of people in the beginning,
including my own friend,

94
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:26,680
they think like I was talking to some
of my own friend, that they say, oh,

95
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:30,280
you're paranoid. You become paranoid.
You need to take a break. You,

96
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:35,320
you're going crazy. Just retire or
get out your the day you're paranoid.

97
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:38,790
Because I was talking about it a long
time before Hendrix and they had,

98
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,770
everybody was disregarding me,
but none when it happened,

99
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:46,771
a lot of it that champion fell and
then a lot of the erode in the sport,

100
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,800
they got pointed out with their
fingers, hey, he's a cheater.

101
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,850
So now it become real. So when
I saw that happen, it was,

102
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,450
it was for me beginning to start and
now it's time to come back. You know,

103
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:02,300
because I'm, I'm a guy of, uh, of uh,

104
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,650
if I said something, you know, that's a
big, I'm going to, I'm going to do it.

105
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,070
I didn't want to come back when the sport
was dirty. I, that's one of my thing.

106
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,820
And so when I, when I,
the site to come back,

107
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:17,130
I add a big dog with one of my trainer,
John Than Hour and a m.

108
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,020
And for us there were my two main
guy and they're like my friend,

109
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:24,980
I brought her with me. I
mean I'm, I'm undefeated with
these, with these two guys,

110
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,770
you know, and they, they're like, well,

111
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:30,890
I need them when I fight series knowledge
between those two men and they mixed

112
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:34,490
together is crazy. You know, there are
two different person, very different.

113
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,510
They both have a um,
um,

114
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,700
they both studied philosophy.

115
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:44,930
It a variant and trusting people for
me to talk with because they have two

116
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:49,910
different mentalities, you know,
they see the world different ways.

117
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,710
So I like to have both of
their, uh, expertise. And um,

118
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,170
so John, John, he told
me, he said, listen,

119
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,620
he said you always have tree
big criticizing criticizes
when you were fighting.

120
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:07,650
It just never went up a
weight class. You never, you,

121
00:07:07,651 --> 00:07:10,480
you people to say that you were kind
of borrowing your too much. Siri,

122
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,100
cerebral with technical.
You,

123
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:16,580
you don't want to take on
this as a rerelease w which
made that fight boring and

124
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:18,590
also you don't finish your appointment.
You know,

125
00:07:18,591 --> 00:07:21,710
that was one of my big
criticizing criticizes.

126
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,440
I decide to come back and we change the
way I was training because the way you

127
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:32,400
train reflects the way you fight.
You know, people say, Oh, I'm gonna,

128
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,010
I'm not going to train too hard.
I'm going to do this and training,

129
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,030
but when it's time to five I'm going
to step up. There is no step up.

130
00:07:38,031 --> 00:07:42,740
You're just going to do what what you
did everyday, you know, investment.

131
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,010
So I decide to change a few things and uh,

132
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,120
to correct those three things and that's
what happened. You know, I'm, I'm,

133
00:07:49,121 --> 00:07:52,520
I'm happy it worked. It worked
out well, but that was my goal.

134
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:56,690
I wanted to come back for something that
excite me, something that was different,

135
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,850
something that was unique
and rare, you know, and,

136
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,100
and I didn't want to come back to do
the same thing I was doing before.

137
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:09,230
And that's why I decided to come back.
When you came back, first of all,

138
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:11,480
you came back and fought a very tough guy,
right?

139
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:15,890
You fought a big Michael Bisping at 185
pounds. But what was impressive to me,

140
00:08:15,891 --> 00:08:19,340
it's like you didn't look
like you were gone. Like you,

141
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:23,330
like right away you, it felt like you
felt right back into the groove again.

142
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:24,620
You didn't look out of place,

143
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,820
he didn't look uncomfortable
and you were showing things,

144
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,750
especially different things with your
kicking and your movement that we hadn't

145
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:35,990
seen from you before.
You looked like you had improved.

146
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,810
I was tested. And then the training, uh,

147
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,740
even if harass some of the
guys for Russell went through,

148
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:46,310
tell them like he whispered to them as,
hey, if you knocked out George inspiring,

149
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:50,450
I'll give you money. Or you know, things
like, yeah man, his eye, he's crazy.

150
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:54,110
He's crazy. If I rest is my worst,
send me in training sometime. You know,

151
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,100
he tell Dale, he tells people, it's like,
yeah, few, few Bj for you heard George,

152
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,180
I'm going to glorify you. You
know, I'm gonna, we're gonna. Wow.

153
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,730
I'm going to talk about you and you
know, hey, we're going to be Ip.

154
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,700
That's the opposite of what a lot of
people think a training camp should be for

155
00:09:07,701 --> 00:09:11,540
a champion. It depends what kind of, you
know, we don't train like this everyday,

156
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:16,070
but for my heart sparing, I have when
I'm training for a fight, two days,

157
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:21,050
uh, for my last training camp at two days
that it was like hard sparring that was

158
00:09:21,051 --> 00:09:24,290
called, we called it should bucks
fight, should shoot bucks fighting,

159
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,270
which would put the big loves,
the addition pad and his feet to floor.

160
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,110
Once we touched the floor,
we step and we go back up.

161
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,440
And that was the area of expertise.
We're, Bisping was the most uh, uh,

162
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:42,500
competent, the striking department.
He's going to hit that Flores. Why?

163
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,680
I uh, I was, I was,

164
00:09:45,681 --> 00:09:50,360
I was bringing in a lot of good guys for
aspiring with me. Uh, and in, in, in that,

165
00:09:50,361 --> 00:09:51,890
that and that particular training,

166
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:56,660
it's hard to find someone that is exactly
like, like, are you going to fight?

167
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,840
But you can find a guy that does things
better than him in that particular area.

168
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:02,601
You know,

169
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:07,250
I cannot find a replica of Michael
Bisping was complete as much as Michael

170
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,800
Bisping. But I can find a
guy, for example, that I guy
for coming from Spain is,

171
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,080
his name is Cesar,
is a k one fighter and he's big guy.

172
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:19,850
He's like 205 pounds and he's big and
he's very, very good kickboxer so add him.

173
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,370
During my training camp,
I flew him from Spain.

174
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,980
I had a different bunch of guys that I,
that I,

175
00:10:24,981 --> 00:10:29,380
that I was training with and all of
these guys that I was training with there

176
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,710
are not like Michael Bisping,

177
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:35,000
but in a certain area that
I was training with them.

178
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:39,390
It could be grappling or, or a shoe, uh,

179
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,050
shoe box or a different,
different areas that are,

180
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,230
they could be just as good or
maybe better than Michael Bisping.

181
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:50,110
So that's how I do my training camp. Yeah.
You know, I remember when you brought,

182
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,510
how do you say his last name?
Scott [inaudible].

183
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,760
Is that just not Charlotte Scott
Buskey yeah, the character. Indeed.

184
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,060
When you brought him to work with you
on the ultimate fighter and he would be

185
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:07,560
partying all night drunk and show up
at the gym the next day and still fuck

186
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:09,780
everybody up. Yeah. And did that,

187
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,710
so that guy influence your,

188
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,980
this your idea about just be more relaxed
and training and just not worrying

189
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:22,660
about it as much. Yeah, but
he's at the front like it,

190
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,740
it's a total different
extreme, you know, like,

191
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:30,220
like I don't believe in that extreme.
But John [inaudible],

192
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,680
I remember the producer of their show
with the ultimate fighter when he wasn't,

193
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,810
he was supposed to stay one week
and when he was about to say,

194
00:11:36,811 --> 00:11:38,190
the producer was telling me is,
hey,

195
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,220
can we keep him for the rest of their
show because he was a good TV, you know,

196
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,720
so I'm like, I don't know.
I'm going to ask him. And,

197
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,620
and the in the same time like it, a lot
of the people in my thing, they were like,

198
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:53,770
man, okay, that's enough. Now we got what
we need and that, and I was like, yeah,

199
00:11:53,771 --> 00:11:57,340
I like him, but he's just kind of a, you
know what? I need to kind of babysit him.

200
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,174
And the same time,

201
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:04,110
the knowledge that this guy
add an e he gave us was just a,

202
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,430
a big, a big edge, you know?
And, um, but as I shall,

203
00:12:09,431 --> 00:12:11,520
he is a different extreme, or Joe, I take,

204
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,620
there is a center line that
you need to keep, you know,

205
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,570
that's what I believe. I believe in
life. It's not white. It's not black.

206
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:24,060
It's always green there. There's middle
zone for everything, I believe. Yeah.
