1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,750
I thought if he thought the way he
always fights that would be a car Raisie

2
00:00:03,751 --> 00:00:04,021
fight.

3
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:09,021
But he was so nervous from that fight
from the steep bay fight that he just did

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:14,040
terrible. He just couldn't pull the
trigger. They're frozen of hurt back.

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,340
So you've got a complete shit
show out of two knockout artists.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,270
I just think that um, that uh, you know,

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,260
has been out for a long time. He's a
motherfucker though. He's the best.

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,820
I think he the best. I think he's the
best in terms of like physical ability.

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,270
You think he's the best heavyweight
of all time? I think he's the best.

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,580
I think he has to do,
I used to do a little more work.

11
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,860
Think he's the best in terms
of what he's accomplished.

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,800
I think fate or is the best heavyweight
of all time in terms of what he's

13
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:44,610
accomplished.
Maybe maybe you can make the argument for,

14
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:46,920
for BC over doom because
we're doing beat him,

15
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,950
but I think for doing beat a fade or
that had already been through the ringer

16
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:52,590
and pride and all the chaos over there.

17
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:56,040
I mean he had been in those
wars with fucking cro cop,

18
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,880
but for doing beat him when it was still
the ORIF fade or he was the first one

19
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:01,660
where,
where you realized she was shooting of,

20
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,280
cause Brett Rogers kind of
took a little bit out of that.

21
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,070
Did he starched fucking payout them but
before that he had trouble with them.

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,170
It was a, it wasn't an easy
fight. It wasn't an easy
fight. It was me. Respect Brat.

23
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:15,120
Right.
He did have a cro cop like,

24
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,860
I mean you'll curl hop fucking
punch and leaped and Oh fucking God.

25
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:24,000
You know with that right hand and right
hand was redonkulous though I it's, it's,

26
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,880
it's tough to say greatest of all time
because it's the greatest of that time

27
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:28,740
period because when,
when he was doing it,

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,020
there were specialists that he was great.

29
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,430
There were certain things
that made him great.

30
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,540
He was under size because if you put his
skill set with his frame now into the,

31
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,170
the, the pool, it's, I
don't know if he's the best,

32
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,000
but then Cain at his time when there's
jds and he's in his prime Brock Lesnar

33
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:47,940
and he's beating those guys,
what cane would do to people,

34
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:51,180
he would overwhelm you in a way
that looked like you were drowning.

35
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,640
His Cardio and pace was
insane. Insane. Like did you,

36
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,800
did junior dos Santos fights I think
took so much out of junior, both of them.

37
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,670
I think it took it, both of them paid the
price. Yeah. It was the same thing as a,

38
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:03,930
I was listened to.
Um,

39
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,490
who's the box you just had on from a
love Kelly Pavlik how you were saying he

40
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:12,360
doesn't watch the rematch with Canelo
triple g cause it takes so much out of

41
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:14,670
those guys that they're never the same.
I'm using,

42
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:18,850
I'm usually on the same thinking
path. Is that where I'm like, God,

43
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,750
if those guys go out again,
man, we're never going to
get a good product. But Cain,

44
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,560
Cain and junior for sure.
I mean,

45
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,590
especially the third fight and the third
fight was second one to the second one

46
00:02:28,591 --> 00:02:32,980
to pop both of them. They just then
jds a steep bay. Yeah, that was,

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,070
that was quite steep.
And jds has had some Warthen steep.

48
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,300
It has had some wars and you can,
you can tell that they're there.

49
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,780
They're just different in life. I'm not
saying it's brain train, whatever it is,

50
00:02:42,781 --> 00:02:44,550
but it's just, they're just
different. They're not,

51
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,920
they leave a piece of themselves in that,
in that octagon.

52
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,100
Well it's for sure some brain trauma.
Yeah.

53
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,570
I'm just trying to be nice to try and
be nice and getting hit in the head that

54
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,580
much. Like they, they, they leave,

55
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:56,790
they leave a little piece of mint
in there for our entertainment.

56
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,270
And I feel a little guilty about what's
crazy. This was no talk about Steve Bay.

57
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,330
Steve paid the most accomplished
heavyweight of all time.

58
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,630
He's the greatest in terms
of like his accomplishments.

59
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,270
He defended the title more than anybody.

60
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,780
He didn't fight the best guys in their
prime when he fought junior and junior

61
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:16,050
was definitely past his
prime knock on him. Right.

62
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,850
But again, when, when it
was his run during his era,

63
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,540
Steve Bay's the best when
it was Kane during his era,

64
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,530
he was the best fade or was the best.

65
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,610
It's hard to say this has been in this
guy because it's just a different time

66
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:35,350
period. Right. Jordan better than Lebron
Jordan during that era. By far the best,

67
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,810
the Brown right now, by far the best.
It's stupid. We don't know. I don't know.

68
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,020
You know, so that's, that's the
question about steep pace. Like why,

69
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,810
why is there no talk
about him fighting again?

70
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,110
Like why have they not said
something he's trying, he's trying.

71
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:53,590
Like he even tweeted that he
goes DC before your retire.
Let's do it, man. Yeah.

72
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,390
Like quit waiting for
John. Let's do it. Well,

73
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:57,970
he's being really active
on social media trying to,

74
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,310
but it doesn't seem like there's
a lot cause he has to be,

75
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,990
because you know why it's not in his
nature. We know that's not steepened.

76
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:08,110
We know that. That's not Steve. He's a
firefighter. Humble, blue collar dude.

77
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,930
He's going to put in work.
Comes to fight all the time.

78
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,930
So Derrick Lewis explains
turning down Steve Bay fight.

79
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,870
Derrick says they wanted me to
fight steep at short notice.

80
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:20,170
I wanted some time off. I would still
fight steep pay, but not right now.

81
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:21,004
Not so soon.

82
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,730
Especially after you're fighting a guy
like DC who's more of a wrestler thing,

83
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,790
going to fight steep pay.
I know I wanted some time off.

84
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,960
So they tried getting steep a fight, so
they were trying to get them for the UFC.

85
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:35,800
He's a Brooklyn car this weekend.
Nuts. Uh, was that this weekend,

86
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,540
but it's smart of Derek Lewis.
They see when you go DC then Steve Bay,

87
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,190
there couldn't be two
worst match ups for him.

88
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,840
He's going to get paid to beatings.
You're going to take, but you know,

89
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:48,140
it's likely unless he connects.
Yeah.
