1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
The plants themselves. Yeah, it's
all, it's all very strange, man.

2
00:00:03,271 --> 00:00:05,130
There's no way out man.
There's no way out of this.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,790
But in their eyes even there
was no way out. It's the out.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,170
It's the path of least pain and suffering.
And I would tell those folks,

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,070
I respect the shit out of
that and I'm trying to do,

6
00:00:17,071 --> 00:00:22,071
I'm trying to take my own this into my
own hands and actively in a more tangible

7
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:23,460
way.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,960
Your hands off I'm hands on is the way
that I would say that and I respect the

9
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:30,380
hands off.
I respect like that.

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,720
I'm cognizant of what's happening
here and I'm trying to make it better.

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,410
I respect that. I, I feel what you saying
and I see what you're trying to do.

12
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,650
But if I'm thinking through the eyes
of a Vegan, you can go fuck yourself.

13
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,060
I'm being the nice guy and you're in a
dick like vegans. A lot of them are dicks

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,120
cause wiling and eating animals. You're
killing animals. He fucking asshole.

15
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:58,660
You think you got a free pass?
Just kill animals and time you bond.

16
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:03,450
You don't, some of them. So I liked
this devil's advocate side of new Joe.

17
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,140
Thank you. Did you see Moby ever?
Look at Moby's page. Never helped.

18
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,470
It's a wonderful Instagram page and
everything be something that was so

19
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:13,860
preposterous the other day. And uh, I
read the comments under it. I was like,

20
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:18,010
this is so hilarious about eggs
and uh, this is what it's, I mean,

21
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,510
first of all folks, you kind of
talking to a person who has chickens,

22
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,640
eggs are like the most Karma free thing
says eggs cannot legally be labeled as

23
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:29,730
healthy, nutritious, or
safe to eat. First of all,

24
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,690
this is true because the eggs are
full of cholesterol and saturated fat.

25
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,540
And because every year over a hundred
thousand people in the u s contract,

26
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:39,410
Salmonella from eggs, they cannot legally
be advertised as healthier, safer,

27
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,680
nutritious. Okay? First of
all, this central, okay, I
dunno why you posted that Moby.

28
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:47,040
You didn't look into it. Is
there something called add
vault at animal equality?

29
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,300
How many people get Salmonella
from eggs every year?

30
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:55,730
Because if it was 100,000,
the fuck that shouldn't be in the news,

31
00:01:55,731 --> 00:01:59,790
Bro would collapse. So God
damn fast, so let's dismantle.

32
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,800
Please go ahead and do that.

33
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:07,650
Does dismantle this preposterous idea
that 100,000 people get Salmonella.

34
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:11,010
Okay, here we go. Even
with safety steps in place,

35
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:16,011
it is estimated that about one in 20,000
or one in 10,000 eggs are contaminated

36
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:23,100
with Salmonella. Wow, that's
a lot is movie, right?

37
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,450
What does he, what did he say?
100,000 people get it right,

38
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,610
but we see if you could find how many
people in the u s contract Salmonella,

39
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,310
because if they find out
that this salmonella in eggs,

40
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:43,050
are they finding out that's
from uncooked eggs every year,

41
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,770
about a million people get Salmonella
infected from foods that had been

42
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:51,000
contaminated by one of the many
kinds of Salmonella. Is he right?

43
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,010
Okay. Let's, let's see if
it's 100,000 people from egs,

44
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,350
how many people per year
get salmonella from eggs?

45
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,240
Where does it say Salmonella
in the United States?

46
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:07,990
142,000 people in the United States
are infected each year with Salmonella.

47
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,480
Whoa. Hold on. That says from
chicken eggs. Wait a minute.

48
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,040
142,000 people in the United States are
infected each year with salmonella from

49
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:22,930
chicken, eggs, and about 30 die
dude. Not only is Mobi Mobi, right,

50
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,970
but he's off by 42,000 now you're going
to be way more of a devil's advocate.

51
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,210
I'm going gonna hit you hard with this
stills out. Let's go on. What'd you do?

52
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:36,070
Have any egg, egg related kind of

53
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,620
salmonellosis. That's what gives
what it is when you get it.

54
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,500
So we found that this is true
thousand. Yup. Not only is it true,

55
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,780
it's from 2010 maybe it's different.

56
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:51,781
In 2018 142,000 people in United States
are infected each year with Salmonella

57
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:57,200
and
enter itis cinder.

58
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,960
I end or Itus and Titus and writers
from chicken eggs and about 30 die.

59
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,880
So he lost 30 pussies in 2010.
And analysis of death certificate,

60
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:11,380
joking, joking. It's just a
joke. How many podcasts we're in.

61
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:13,110
The comedy section of Itunes,
uh,

62
00:04:13,111 --> 00:04:18,111
identified 1,316 salmonella
related deaths from 1990 to 2006.

63
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,810
Whoa. Whoa. Now, thanks for
[inaudible]. But this is a problem.

64
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:25,660
These fucking dummies are eating them raw.
This is what I want you to Google.

65
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,440
How nutritious our eggs.
How about Google this?

66
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,100
Because a lot of ways,
situational fucking life,

67
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:35,320
I've never gotten salmonella were pretty
good. You look great. You're doing fine.

68
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,290
By the way, if you eat chicken
raw, you get Salmonella to stupid.

69
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,870
You're not supposed to eat it
raw. I supposed to cook it. Okay.

70
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:45,010
One egg has only 75 calories,
but seven grams of high quality protein,

71
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:49,840
five grams of fat and 1.6 grams of
saturated fat along with iron, vitamins,

72
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,810
minerals,
and Kara carotinoids.

73
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:58,080
The AG is a powerhouse of disease fighting
nutrients like Lutein and Zeaxanthin.

74
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:03,670
Okay, movie, so shut the fuck up.
They're super, super nutritious for you.

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,060
Just occasional back off Moby.
Somebody gets Salmonella.

76
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,240
How about just cook your
fucking fucking eggs,

77
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,840
but here's where it gets really dark.
Why don't you Google this?

78
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,980
How many people die every year from
Ecolab? From vegetables. That's right,

79
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:24,130
cause a shitload anti corn is
actually from farmed animals.

80
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,490
That's actually from agricultural
runoff from the, let's Google,

81
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:32,200
how much methane comes from how
much methane comes from vegans,

82
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:36,130
Broccoli. It's dead. Like hell.
Yeah. Let's come back to this.

83
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:40,590
Like where do you play the Wii?
And it's fun. Just love him.

84
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:44,310
He's so right. He's not just
writing. He's, he's more than 40,000.

85
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:48,190
[inaudible] Moby please. Uh,
just six degrees of Mobi.

86
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:52,090
Edit your post with the correct number.
Write about like eggs or dangerous bro.

87
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:55,990
Don't eat them wrong, like
good diet. Don't eat them raw.
Stupid. Okay, here it goes.

88
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,450
CDC estimates 260 out.
Wow.

89
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,260
265,000 infections occur each year
in the United States of ECO lie.

90
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,650
Wow.
36% are caused by e Cola.

91
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,250
Zero one five or 7.87.
Dude,

92
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,970
it's almost all from animal agriculture
is almost all from uh, from Shit,

93
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,051
from Shit.

94
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:22,370
Water types of Ecolab can cross islands
can be transmitted through contaminated

95
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:25,130
water or food to contract with
the animals where people, yeah,

96
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:26,480
but when they say contaminated water,

97
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,230
what they really mean is that water's
contaminated with shit from animal

98
00:06:30,231 --> 00:06:34,100
agriculture. I think almost
entirely. What is the timeline?

99
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,090
The source of Eco Lie?

100
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:41,450
The Google this most prominent
source of eco lie from in vegetables.

101
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,160
I would guarantee you it's um,
animal agriculture. I mean,

102
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:48,590
if you see those gigantic factory farms,

103
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:51,980
the runoff and most prominent
source of Nikolai and vegetables,

104
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:52,814
is that what you said?

105
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:58,400
Because you're better at this than maybe
you just need to figure it out. Get it,

106
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:02,180
Joe. You find it, you find the
evidence. I'm trying to be,

107
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:05,660
I'm trying to be a can mobi.
Yeah. I'm trying to be a Vegan.

108
00:07:05,661 --> 00:07:09,020
I'm not arguing for the vegans.
Vegans, I like this. I like this.

109
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,800
It's not hard to do. It's hard to do
it. It's a respectable position, man.

110
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,560
It just is. It's all three
actually. Was this most prominent,

111
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,450
the thing that popped up as the most
common way to acquire you eye infections

112
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,950
can be pasteurized milk,
fresh produce.

113
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,160
And that fresh produce means not
cooked. So if you get Broccoli, spinach,

114
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,760
you're supposed to cook spinach,
celery,

115
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,790
and that's a problem with Romaine
lettuce, right? Because Romaine is,

116
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,220
nobody ever cooks that
stupid fucking shit.

117
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,750
I fuck the world had no Romaine lettuce.
Do you think you'd be okay?

118
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:44,000
I think it'd be fine. Dining calls
it the hard lettuce. He's like,

119
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:46,110
I don't want that hard. Let
us give me the soft. Oh,

120
00:07:46,111 --> 00:07:49,250
I don't like giving the soft
lettuce iceberg is just a joke.

121
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,110
That's just room for meat.

122
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,010
I could be putting meat in my
stomach instead of that shitty ass.

123
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,390
It's just delicious. And the
lettuce. Yeah. Listen, I should say.
