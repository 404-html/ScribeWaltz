1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,560
But there's been such a significant
improvement in all those places that the

2
00:00:04,561 --> 00:00:06,420
resistance tends to,
I mean,

3
00:00:06,421 --> 00:00:09,090
how many people arguing for reversing
the cannabis legalization? Hey,

4
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:10,440
you don't ever hear it now.
Right.

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,870
And it's been a little bit of a
backlash and it kind of absurd,

6
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:16,280
but because it's come out repeatedly
kind of victor like artist Ilo,

7
00:00:16,281 --> 00:00:19,490
I actually had that guy. I really
tell me about that. Why, how did,

8
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:24,610
we had a debate between him and
Alex Bernstein and a doctor,

9
00:00:25,161 --> 00:00:29,250
Mike Hart from Canada.
Um, and there's some,

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,570
there's some reality to the dangers of
cannabis use as some people that are

11
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:37,950
susceptible to schizophrenia. Um,
and I think that there's also some,

12
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:41,310
at least anecdotal evidence at a points
of the fact that some people experience

13
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:46,170
these psychotic breaks and
these schizophrenia episodes
probably directly as a

14
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:49,620
result of large dose use of Thc,

15
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:52,800
whether it's through edibles or whether
it's through smoking at some people

16
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:54,450
freak out.
I've known people,

17
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,750
I've known of people that have
had real issues with it. I mean,

18
00:00:57,751 --> 00:01:01,050
had a comedian here a couple of weeks ago,
talked about he doesn't smoke pot,

19
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,890
he's from Brazil. He smoked
pot, a s of use, a vape pen, uh,

20
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,310
took a bunch of hits and was
fucked up for two weeks. There are,

21
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,760
there are dangers and problems, certain
pizzas. So it's really important.

22
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:14,790
The case for legalizing cannabis is not
that there was no harm associated with

23
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:17,850
cannabis, right? In the same way the
case bill legalizing alcohol is not,

24
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,980
there's no homeless. I said, well,

25
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,080
this is what Alex Bernstein is
trying to go over in his book.

26
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:24,660
I don't think he did a good
job for two reasons. One,

27
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,960
because he's basically only making
the case for it to be negative.

28
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,950
And I think there's far more evidence
that cannabis has a positive influence on

29
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:39,210
people. It reinforces community. It
makes people more sensitive and kind.

30
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,680
This a thought of paranoia might
actually, it, it makes people more humble.

31
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,880
Um, it makes sex feel better and
fix food tastes better. There's,

32
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,820
there's creativity aspects
to it that are undeniable.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,780
There's a lot of very positive aspects
to it. For some people it's not good,

34
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,530
but it's like saying, hey, some
people die when they eat peanuts.

35
00:01:58,531 --> 00:02:03,030
Let's outlaw peanuts. I think that
one of your children about peanuts,

36
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,790
I think everything you just
said is absolutely right.

37
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,040
I think there's another layer
that's going on at the same time,

38
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,370
a kind of below that, which is really
important people to understand.

39
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,890
So there's this thing. Um, so
very often people will say, ah,

40
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,620
you get kind of republican
politicians like caught.

41
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:21,240
I'm a colleague Thena arena
saying it during when the
Republican debates in 2016,

42
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,200
2015 maybe,
um,

43
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,780
we can't legalize cannabis because it's
much stronger now than it used to be.

44
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
Thc content is called up.
People are smoking skunk.

45
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,900
It's really important to
understand why that happened.

46
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,340
It's because of drug prohibition.

47
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,750
So the day before alcohol was banned in
the u s the most popular drinks by far

48
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:37,584
were beer and wine.

49
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,930
In the weeks after alcohol prohibition
ended most popular drinks again,

50
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:45,630
where they're in wine as they are today.
In between,

51
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:47,670
you could not get hold of bear and wine.
The most popular drinks,

52
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:52,230
whiskey and moonshine. You cannot,
you think, well why would that be?

53
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:56,850
What's going on? And it's because of a
kind of slightly wonky and boring thing,

54
00:02:56,851 --> 00:03:00,010
but I think it's worth talking about
is called the Iron Law of prohibition.

55
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:03,490
If you imagine, if we had to
smuggle the nearest bar to here,

56
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:07,810
if we had to smuggle all the alcohol for
that bar in a wagon from the Canadian

57
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:11,890
border, from the Mexican border,
right from Tijuana in a wagon,

58
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,770
we fill our wagon with beer, we're
going to get drink for a hundred people.

59
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,710
If we fill it with vodka, wigging it,
drink for thousands of people, right?

60
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,370
So when you ban a drug and
it has to be smuggled around,

61
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,120
you get a premium on getting the
biggest possible kick into the smallest

62
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,170
possible space,
right?

63
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,520
This is why mild forms of
the drug disappear before
opiates were banned in the

64
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:31,354
United States.

65
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:35,020
Most popular way of consuming
it was something called
Mrs Winslow Soothing Syrup,

66
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,230
which you would buy in the pharmacy,
right? Very low level of opiates.

67
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,120
Most popular way of consuming cocoa based
products prior to the banning was Coca

68
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,360
Cola, right? That's called that for
a reason. Uh, when the ban happens,

69
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,680
heroin becomes something from opiates.

70
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:50,320
Powder cocaine becomes the
only form of cocaine. In fact,

71
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:53,050
when there's a huge crackdown
on powder cocaine and the ATS,

72
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,190
the iron law kicks in even more.
And that's when crack is invented.

73
00:03:56,191 --> 00:03:59,410
Cause you can get even more of a hair into
an even smaller possible space. Right?

74
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,540
So I think at some point to understand
if you want, it is not good.

75
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,620
Most people who drink alcohol don't want
to drink vodka and they certainly don't

76
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:10,480
want drink absinthe most of the time.
Right.

77
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,220
Most people want a mild form of their
drug. That's true. Cannabis. That's true.

78
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:16,120
Of course, there's some people
who want to get totally fucked up,

79
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:18,070
either for fun or because
they have addiction problems.

80
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,730
Most people want a mild form of the drug
is not good that malforms or the drug

81
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,170
when they're not. I don't
think that's true. Uh,

82
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,890
it's definitely not true in California,
in California,

83
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:30,610
what happened was medical care cannabis
got passed and what's medical cannabis

84
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:31,444
got passed.

85
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,540
There was a an emphasis on the strongest
possible stuff because people wanted

86
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:38,260
it.
I mean,

87
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:41,950
it was a direct result of people having
higher tolerances because marijuana was

88
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:43,570
so readily available and they,

89
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:46,270
if you have a high tolerance
and you smoke a lot of pot,

90
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,840
you want strong pot because
week pot doesn't do anything.

91
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,790
It's the number one complaint amongst
cannabis enthusiasts is someone having

92
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:55,660
week pops.

93
00:04:55,661 --> 00:05:00,060
You've got a subculture of people who are
cannabis enthusiasts who you're right,

94
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,540
there's a subconscious just like there's
a subculture of people who want Volcker

95
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,980
App south. Right, right. But I don't think
it's a matter. It's not the same thing.

96
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:09,160
Like Jen obviously is more potent
than whiskey or then beer rather.

97
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,570
It's easier to carry gen around. You
have to carry less of it. With cannabis,

98
00:05:13,571 --> 00:05:15,610
people are still buying the same quantity.

99
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:20,470
They're just getting more
fucked up because their
tolerances are so much higher.

100
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:24,190
They need a stronger and stronger THC.
So as you have a legal market,

101
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:27,990
you can have a variety of options,
right. What you have is what would,

102
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,540
what we'll discover. I think as time goes
by, because we know this with alcohol,

103
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,110
is different people want cannabis to do
different things. You're totally right.

104
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:37,930
There's some people who want
maximum THC maximally fucked up.

105
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:41,800
Just some people where there's still
a market for for lower grade we'd,

106
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:46,030
I mean they have it listed at all these
dispensaries. They have it listed,

107
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:46,301
you know,

108
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:51,301
20% 35% they have it listed so you can
choose a more mild marijuana if you like

109
00:05:51,711 --> 00:05:54,520
to, but the oh gee people, the
people that do it every day,

110
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,100
of course they want that really potent
weed. It's not like I would say they're

111
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,780
more like the people in Vegas who gamble
a professional gamblers versus the

112
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:05,360
people who go to Vegas for the weekend
and just want to play a real well.

113
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,240
There's definitely a concentrated market,

114
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,260
very dedicated users who want to get
maximally fucked up. You're totally right.

115
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,160
I think that's what pushed the Po.

116
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:17,090
I mean it's also in botanists and I'm
friends with a bunch of people who breed

117
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:20,000
and grow these various strains.
But if you think about,

118
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,540
so professor David not has done
really interesting work on this.

119
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,320
So if I remember rightly, there's 38
active components in cannabis, right?

120
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,520
So cannabinoids, well there's hundreds
of cannabinoids. So I think the,

121
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,030
if I'm in from press and not sweat the,

122
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:37,640
that he argues this 38 kind of significant
active components, maybe other people.

123
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:41,270
Yeah, I think there's over a
hundred canabinoids I think
we just discussed this,

124
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:42,140
right? Right. Then we, uh,

125
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,680
so one of the things he Auggie's and
I'm happy to be quoted on the specific

126
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:50,660
number, but one of the things he,
he Auggie's um, is you've got it,

127
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,430
cause you were talking about
schizophrenia and psychosis.

128
00:06:52,431 --> 00:06:56,360
I think it's important to understand
there is some evidence that very high

129
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:59,810
exposure to THC in a small
number of people can,

130
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,850
can lead to psychosis.
Right?

131
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,670
And that's even a small number of people
where you have a very widely used drug

132
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:06,230
is, is that's really problematic. Right?

133
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,960
But actually this was
readjusting evidence.

134
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:14,140
So why do people who are prone to
psychosis or schizophrenia want cannabis?

135
00:07:14,691 --> 00:07:17,510
Right? Cause there was a lot of them
who want it. It's not the people,

136
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:22,730
hardly anyone wants to have a psychotic
episode. It's actually so THC,

137
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:26,780
um, uh, correlates with, with
psychosis in some people.

138
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:31,550
But there's another component cannabis
called CBD, uh, kind of a dial,

139
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:35,450
which actually we know
there's good evidence sue the
psychosis and schizophrenia,

140
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:39,380
right? It's actually given us a treatment
in some places in distilled pill form.

141
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,030
So actually it's a slightly more complex
picture then cannabis causes psychosis,

142
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:48,110
right? Very rich THC in some
people will cause psychosis.

143
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:51,590
That's a real problem. There are
things we can do to prevent that.

144
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:54,890
And one of the good things about
legal market is you can regulate it.

145
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,520
So we can limit the amount of THC that
is available. Just like we can limit,

146
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,520
you know, you can't go and buy 70%
proof alcohol, but also what, what,

147
00:08:02,521 --> 00:08:05,840
what professor not has been arguing
is we need to be, and they exist,

148
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:09,830
but they need to be commercialized
and promoted more, um,

149
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:13,200
or promoted and public health way.
Not necessarily commercially, um,

150
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,180
CBD rich cannabis will actually be
helpful to people with psychosis and

151
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:19,750
schizophrenia. It's just a slightly more
complicated picture. I know that you,

152
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,800
you're not saying that it is, you're not
endorsing what the, tell your kids go.

153
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:29,110
What's it called again? The guy who did
your debate. Um, our experience too. Yeah.

154
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,470
I know you're not endorsing the kind of
simplistic view on either side, but the,

155
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,490
the, um, I think it's slightly more,
slightly more complicated than that.

156
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,410
The other thing I think is really
worth saying though to people is,

157
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,900
there's one thing we will do agree on,

158
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:46,340
which is cannabis is bad for young
teenagers. Right? After developing brains,

159
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,950
there's one person I interviewed,
it really helped me to, again,

160
00:08:48,951 --> 00:08:51,980
to think about this guy
called Fred Martins who's in,

161
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:55,800
I went to go see him in
Camden, New Jersey, and Fred
was a co, he's retired now,

162
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,170
but he was a cop.
I was really kind of right wing.

163
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,270
You reminded me of the Clint
Eastwood character in dirty Harry.

164
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:04,380
He's not a liberal. Right.
And he had this, he wouldn't
use a fancy word like this.

165
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,960
Behind the epiphany
about drug legalization.

166
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:09,300
One day he was in a car park in Wayne,

167
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:14,301
New Jersey in 1971 it was staking out
a dealer and he's in plain clothes

168
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:18,120
obviously. And a kid comes up to him like
an 11 year old or something and goes,

169
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,200
hey Mr,
um,

170
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,430
I'm not allowed to buy alcohol where you
go into that liquor store and buy some

171
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:26,010
for me and frank guys now get outta here.

172
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,760
So the kid walks over to the drug dealer
and buy some drugs from him instead.

173
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,380
And Fred has this kind of realization,
which is, oh, he wouldn't put it this way,

174
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:38,340
but legalization puts a regulatory barrier
between kids and drugs that doesn't

175
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:42,180
currently exist, right? This is why since
they legalized cannabis in Colorado,

176
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,100
there's been, don't
overstate it, it's not huge,

177
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:47,040
but there's been a significant fall
in teenage cannabis use, right?

178
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,580
Drug dealers don't check ID
licensed legal businesses,

179
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:53,670
do they really care if they're there
because they've got something to lose?

180
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:54,504
Right.

181
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,800
So I think if sometimes it's used as
the kind of protect our kids argument is

182
00:09:58,801 --> 00:10:02,400
used as a case for prohibition. In
fact, if you want to protect your kids,

183
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,910
you should be putting a big premium on
getting these substances out of the hands

184
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:10,380
of armed criminal gangs and into the
hands of licensed legal businesses.

185
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,760
Yeah, I don't think anybody's
going to argue that.

186
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,490
I mean I think that anybody
rational rather, uh,

187
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:18,790
I think that makes a lot of
sense. I think that, um, the,

188
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:23,380
the number of people that
have schizophrenia is fairly,

189
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,330
it's fairly stable in terms of the
percentage of it across the board,

190
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,820
cannabis users or non cannabis users.

191
00:10:30,821 --> 00:10:34,960
And so the argument against this idea
that cannabis causes schizophrenia breaks

192
00:10:34,961 --> 00:10:38,290
is that these people already have
schizophrenia and it just hasn't really

193
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:41,910
manifested itself in a, in a a tangible
sense. So this is one of things. Thanks

194
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:46,200
professor nuts says, so there's this,
there is some evidence that cannabis, uh,

195
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,240
in a small number of people causes
psychosis as a study in Sweden that showed

196
00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:52,270
this with schizophrenia.
It's much more contested. So,

197
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:56,830
so psychosis versus schizophrenia,
what is the major distinction?

198
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,630
Yeah. I've not researched this in
depth, but um, psychosis involves,

199
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,610
is that the different,
the different paranoia.

200
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,510
Schizophrenia is a
subset of mental illness.

201
00:11:07,511 --> 00:11:10,600
This very specific has a
significant genetic component,

202
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,230
although there can be
environmental triggers for it
so it could possibly trigger

203
00:11:14,231 --> 00:11:14,621
both.

204
00:11:14,621 --> 00:11:18,190
It could possibly trigger psychosis and
schizophrenia argument against that.

205
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,820
So professor, so there is evidence with
psychosis, the argument we're stress,

206
00:11:21,821 --> 00:11:25,500
it's a very small number of
people but it Israel, um, uh, and,

207
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,910
and there are things we can do an
illegal market to counteract that,

208
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:31,060
that much harder to do in a prohibitive
market. But with schizophrenia,

209
00:11:31,061 --> 00:11:31,871
the argument against that,

210
00:11:31,871 --> 00:11:34,690
and I've not looked into this and a huge
amount of detail, so I don't want to,

211
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,930
this is not the same degree of confidence
I've been saying the other stuff,

212
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:40,660
but um, professor not argues, well,

213
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,190
we know that cannabis use has massively
increased in Britain, for example,

214
00:11:45,191 --> 00:11:49,200
I think something like 20 fold increase
since 1916 Britain and yet levels of

215
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:52,810
schizophrenia have remained the same.
If cannabis was it causing schizophrenia,

216
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:53,800
you would it

217
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,520
to vary with cannabis use
at least to some degree.

218
00:11:57,521 --> 00:12:00,760
There'd be some relationship and that
doesn't seem to be the case. So again,

219
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:01,871
that's what professor [inaudible],

220
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:04,870
who's the former chief scientific
advisor on drugs in Britain, says,

221
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:08,590
I haven't looked into that in great
detail. So He's basically right.

222
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:12,590
And all the things that I have
looked into that he says, hmm, um,

223
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,830
do they know what the mechanism would be
that would cause someone to consume THC

224
00:12:17,831 --> 00:12:21,400
and have a psychotic break? Have
that, does that have an exam?

225
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:23,840
I don't know enough about it. It would
seem to be a big issue, right? Like,

226
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,480
find out what it is that's causing this
trigger and whether or not this exists

227
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,380
in these people anyway,

228
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:33,370
and maybe a stressful situation
and a bad breakup losing their job,

229
00:12:33,371 --> 00:12:35,140
maybe one of those things
can also cause his trigger.
