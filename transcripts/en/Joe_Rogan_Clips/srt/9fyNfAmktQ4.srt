1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:05,390
The joe rogan experience.
We got, you know this,

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,520
if you ever do those, use those yonder
bags. You know those bags are in the mix.

3
00:00:09,521 --> 00:00:11,830
You put their cell phone in
the back end for has them.

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,910
Denver uses them for all the shows now.
I started using them for all my shows.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,260
So you just accompany, comes in and just
does it for you. Yeah, you hire them,

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,770
they come in and then when they
put the bag, the phone in the bag,

7
00:00:23,771 --> 00:00:25,170
they still hold onto their phone.

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,310
They can leave the room
if they get a phone call,

9
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,340
like you have a kid or something like
that and someone's watching the kid,

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,990
you can always get out of
the room and make call,

11
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,660
but you can't call people
when you're in the room.

12
00:00:34,661 --> 00:00:38,050
And I was having people calling
people and talking on the phone.

13
00:00:38,051 --> 00:00:41,140
You could see them talking on the phone
while the show's going on and people

14
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,780
around them would be getting pissed off.
And uh,

15
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,970
someone at Twitter
comment on it and he just,

16
00:00:45,971 --> 00:00:49,060
everyone's got their phones up and
look, I know I've done it too. I'm,

17
00:00:49,061 --> 00:00:53,600
I'm totally a hypocrite. When I saw
honey honey with Gary Karch perform it,

18
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:58,030
this little tiny room in downtown La was
a midnight show on like a Tuesday and I

19
00:00:58,031 --> 00:01:00,730
filmed it and I put it on my Instagram.
So I know I'm a hypocrite.

20
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:05,350
But that was a rare occasion
and it wasn't a comedy show.

21
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,980
It's like a comedy show. You have to pay
attention to what the fuck's going on.

22
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,460
If you, if you're filming it, you're
definitely not paying full attention.

23
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,190
It's just not,
you're going to miss some stuff.

24
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:19,780
It's just not the same thing when you're
filming shit. Like everybody is just,

25
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:20,710
and even if you're not,

26
00:01:20,711 --> 00:01:25,360
you're checking this and checking texts
and boy we got a real addiction problem

27
00:01:25,361 --> 00:01:28,420
in this country. The, these, these
are new things is new object.

28
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,130
I realized, cause I'm not
delusional that the amount of it,

29
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,640
I can put most of it to breasts with
a pre announcement where I'm at in my

30
00:01:36,641 --> 00:01:40,720
career. But again, as you get to different
levels, there's different intensity.

31
00:01:40,721 --> 00:01:45,670
So I don't, I get it. But, um, the, uh, I,

32
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,510
I changed my pre show announcement
when I went to see Brian Regan,

33
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:54,070
the person next to me, I,
they were texting, I couldn't
hear them. Matter of fact,

34
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:58,150
they even had their sh the light down.
So you think, well, what could bother me?

35
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,330
And it did. And it didn't matter if it
was right or wrong. I know what it was.

36
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,770
I wanted the person next to him and it'd
be loving him as much as I was loving

37
00:02:05,771 --> 00:02:08,170
him. And the fact that I saw them
on their phone on night even,

38
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:12,370
they weren't making a peep.
It started to bother the fuck out of me.

39
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,980
I was getting angry and
then I went, oh, that's,

40
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,930
I'm going to do the same thing at my show.
I go,

41
00:02:16,931 --> 00:02:19,390
don't turn your thing all the way
down. I go, I know what you think.

42
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:21,790
And you pull it out into
your knee. I go, seriously,

43
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:25,690
if you pull your phone out after this
announcement, do you look like a Dick?

44
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,780
I go and other than that, we're glad
you're here and you know what it,

45
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,510
you just, you have to pick
it. That announcement a
little longer, but it works.

46
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,990
I'm worried about people. I really
are. This is a really new thing.

47
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,460
The more I'm thinking about it,

48
00:02:39,461 --> 00:02:42,940
the more like looking at your phone
constantly is really only 10 years old,

49
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,180
right?
Like 2008 ish.

50
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,900
The not the iPhone came
around 2009 right before that.

51
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:53,590
People were a little texty people,
some people more texty than others.

52
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,240
They really got into text messages.

53
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:00,010
But once that iPhone came out and once
people started doing bunch of stuff and

54
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:03,430
apps and stuff on your phone, it
changed the whole game. You know?

55
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,160
I don't know with this topic,

56
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:09,280
if I'm like I could be way
off or I could be off kilter,

57
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,550
but the way I come to my conclusion
about like, you know, you know it is,

58
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:15,540
it is a weird thing and even me,
I kill acknowledge it. Otherwise,

59
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:16,390
if I don't acknowledge it,

60
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,030
then you're never going to tell some of
the opposing side if they don't think

61
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:20,410
you get what you see it,

62
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,610
but it just seems like in the past
now this could be different with no,

63
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,550
no snarkiness it.
Oh,

64
00:03:25,551 --> 00:03:29,470
this could be a different thing every
time they think there's one of these

65
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:34,471
things like TV radio to
seems like when we get past,

66
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,940
oh I think we'll get past it.
You know what I mean?

67
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:41,200
I didn't know think the world was going
to explode. I'm worried about certain,

68
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,210
I'm not worried about the human race,

69
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:47,020
but I'm worried about the lives of
certain people, if that makes sense.

70
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,490
Because it's like saying like,

71
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:51,610
are you worried that cracks
can destroy the human race? No,

72
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:53,710
I'm not worried that crack
is going to destroy it,

73
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:57,700
but I do think it can destroy the lives
of some people and I feel the same way

74
00:03:57,701 --> 00:04:01,990
about this. Right? Like the texting,
like it's not just that it's,

75
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:06,430
it's like being plugged into electronic
to the point where that's where you're

76
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:10,240
getting most of your stimuli from.
You're getting artificial stimuli.

77
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,810
My concerns is a real
concern is that we're,

78
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:17,860
we're getting really into that and then
we're going to let it take the next step,

79
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:19,240
which is some sort of an implant.

80
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,080
I feel like this is why we're in a movie
and we're going to move you about a

81
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:28,081
person that becomes a machine and we're
watching this rationalization process.

82
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:33,160
As we slowly get more and more ingrained
and inner connected with technology,

83
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,150
we'll definitely in our
lifetime have somebody 100%.

84
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,130
I try like what you were just
addressing. Like we said before, like I,

85
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,800
I catch myself and I really try.

86
00:04:45,801 --> 00:04:48,700
Like if I had to give myself a grade on
how much I've improved and like turning

87
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:51,550
the phone off,
like loving it for what's great about it,

88
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,130
I give myself maybe a c minus,

89
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:57,640
but it means I've made some strides and
like turning it off. You're not enough.

90
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,670
Not enough for a matter of fact.
Uh,

91
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,740
I remember a week ago I was
going to the grove and I went,

92
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,750
I'm not meeting anybody. Um, and I left
my phone in the car. It was strong. Move

93
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,160
strong. No, it sucked
because I had two ideas.

94
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,580
I had two ideas and I was
high and I didn't want to
write them down. I went ass.

95
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,670
Shit. That's the thing about
leaving your phone in the car.

96
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,140
I take a picture or show someone a
picture or it doesn't have to always be,

97
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:26,830
but anyway, I try to go and, you
know, never, never walking through,

98
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,580
never walking through a line that
actually could encourage you to write. Um,

99
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,870
you know,
you could just use hate writing.

100
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:34,930
Okay.
