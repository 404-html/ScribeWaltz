1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,560
The joe rogan experience.
Interesting. Gorgeous.

2
00:00:04,561 --> 00:00:09,180
George was crazy. Yeah. Interesting.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,500
Was a stupid ad. You have to
watch for the Olympics there. Boy,

4
00:00:13,501 --> 00:00:17,040
I'm this Olympics is,
I think I'm going to say this.

5
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:21,410
I think the Olympics are gross. This
is why I think the Olympics are gross.

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,520
I think it's a great opportunity
for all those athletes.

7
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:25,020
I think it's great for people to watch it,

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,030
but I think it is a fucking disgusting
money grab and all those amateur air

9
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:30,421
quotes.

10
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:35,400
Athletes don't get paid shit with them
and these companies are making billions

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,560
and billions of dollars off of them
and I really wish they would all quit.

12
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,170
I really wish they would say,
fuck you pay me.

13
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,270
I really wish they would just go
straight ray Liotta they give a fuck.

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,910
You pay me. They get up there.
They're youth for that. Not only that,

15
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,090
the fucking companies,
they're so restrictive,

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,770
they're the IOC and all the people that
are behind it are so restrictive and

17
00:00:55,771 --> 00:01:00,720
they are making ungodly sums of money,
ungodly contracts.

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,780
They're just giant contracts to air the,
the Olympics,

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,380
giant amounts of money to
build the stadiums and set up,

20
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:11,760
these are these events and that everything
is about net nationalism and national

21
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:15,210
pride, whether it's in Korea or Russia
or wherever the fuck they do them.

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,350
But meanwhile, the athletes don't
get dick. They don't get Dick.

23
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,990
If you're lucky and you're Michael Phelps,
you become famous out of it.

24
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:23,820
And you get a bunch of commercials,

25
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,520
commercials and endorsements and you
make a shit load of money that way.

26
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:30,630
But how many Michael Phelps is, are there
was a three or four, I mean how many,

27
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:34,410
but how many in the, all
the, all the Olympics and out
of all the Olympics, Jamie,

28
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:39,360
you're a sports fan at all the Olympics,
say like the Olympics this year. Well,

29
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,600
let's go to the last one.
Who the fuck came out of it?

30
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,190
Where they're a household name?

31
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,580
Right now you've got Shaun white
and maybe I heard of that guy.

32
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,920
The girl that won, uh,
Kim is her last name

33
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,820
last night or two nights before the
real famous. Uh, there's Lindsey Vaughn,

34
00:01:56,821 --> 00:01:59,130
she's very famous.
She's very famous that she,

35
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,490
she used to date tiger woods that
made her famous too. Plus she's hot.

36
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,740
That makes her famous. It's
peekaboo. Straight Shit.
Interesting names. So like her,

37
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,150
she's a gold medal winner, I believe.
How many other ones out of there?

38
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,850
There's a few.
I mean there's like a handful.

39
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,040
They can build a story around someone,
then they can tell the story.

40
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,100
But when you get to the point where
it's worthwhile to sacrifice your entire

41
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:23,250
life and it actually pays off,
what are the, what are the odds?

42
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:28,170
It's so fucking small, but meanwhile
people are tuning in to all of it.

43
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,370
They're making massive amounts of revenue
from all of it and they're not sharing

44
00:02:32,371 --> 00:02:34,980
it with the athletes at all.
I think it's fucking gross.

45
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,470
They pretend it's amateur.
Different tenants and amateur.

46
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,220
It's a Goddamn motherfucking business.
That's what the Olympics are. Well,

47
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,010
there's considerable college business.
You can't basketball and football.

48
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:47,790
Really?

49
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,790
NCAA says student athletes shouldn't be
paid because the 13th amendment allows

50
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:57,510
unpaid prison labor. What the
fuck? Oh, that's Shaun King.

51
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,610
This is breaking up. This is
a, this is another article.

52
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,640
This was the main one going around,
but there's uh, uh, that's crazy.

53
00:03:04,641 --> 00:03:07,570
Did they really say that? Did they
really say that? The 13th amendment,

54
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,600
which allows unpaid prison
labor decided in a lawsuit,

55
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,880
a response to a motion
to dismiss and they,

56
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:16,450
that's what they use is so disgusting.
They're so disgusting.

57
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:21,400
They're the same to me. Ncaa College
football and basketball, same thing to me.

58
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,750
They have 180 of those thousand people.
Yeah, fuck you pay those guys, pay him,

59
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,840
pay those girls, pay all those
athletes. You're making money,

60
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,330
you're making money and you're
not sharing it with the athletes.

61
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,240
They might as well be slaves.
They might as well be fucking prisoners,

62
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,820
the Olympics, Ncaa, all that
shit. It's just these no way.

63
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,240
There's no way you could
do that fresh today.

64
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,910
Have you started from
scratch today and said,

65
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:49,350
we're going to get make billions of
dollars and we're going to give you boom.

66
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,760
Got It. Gotcha. Cool.

67
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,910
There was no way you
could never do education.

68
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,460
Imagine they did that with the
Olympics today. They said, look,

69
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:59,320
we're going to spend billions
of dollars in the athletes.

70
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,990
What are they going to pay? Oh,
we're not going to pay them shit.

71
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,140
They don't get anything. You remember just
to be making any money. You're fucked.

72
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,050
You're out. It used to be that
you made money, you're out,

73
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:11,110
but now they let basketball
players play in the Olympics.

74
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:13,170
They like the NBA players because of,

75
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:17,620
I think it was Russia was getting
close and beat and they beat us once.

76
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,300
[inaudible] 72 I think. Oh, is that what
it was? They started thinking about it.

77
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:25,720
Then when we got, they were catching up.
The European players were catching up.

78
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,420
They go, fuck this. We're going
to send over our brothers.

79
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:33,570
NBC Sports is about to make one point $4
billion in 22 days thanks to the super

80
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:37,460
bowl and the winter Olympics.
Okay. The Superbowl,

81
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,210
at least his professional athletes,
I guess they get paid,

82
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:44,410
they get paid and whether they get paid
enough is up for debate. I get that,

83
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,140
but the Olympics,

84
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:51,850
they're not getting paid dick and it's
fucking gross and it makes me angry and

85
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:55,330
it's one of the reasons why I don't watch
the Olympics. I get mad at it. You know,

86
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:57,760
I wanted to be in the Olympics at
one point in time, but to fight,

87
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,900
I wanted to be in taekwondo was being
introduced the Olympics in 1988 I tried

88
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:05,320
out for the national team. I got it
to like the quarter finals in Miami.

89
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:10,300
I won three fights and it
was, um, that was the last,

90
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,300
like my last,
uh,

91
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,140
my really last fascination with taekwondo.

92
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:19,510
I'd kind of given up on
taekwondo really before it.

93
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:29,690
Okay.
