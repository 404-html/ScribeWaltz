1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,240
Open sources self in,
in its title,

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,030
pretty much people kind
of understand what it is.

3
00:00:06,031 --> 00:00:09,630
It means that various
coders get to share in this,

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,250
this code and the source code and they
they get to innovate and they all get to

5
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:17,910
participate and use each
other's work. Right, right. Um,

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,780
but blockchain is confusing for a lot
of people. Could you explain that?

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,210
Sure. I'm in Blah Blah. Blockchain
itself is almost a misnomer.

8
00:00:27,211 --> 00:00:30,690
So we're confusing. Things are confusing
at, at the, at every level, right.

9
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:32,010
So we can,

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,150
we should start with the
idea of a distributed ledger,

11
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:40,320
which is basically like a distributed
excel spreadsheet or database.

12
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:45,060
It's just a store of information which
is not stored just in one place where

13
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:47,400
there's copies of it in a
lot of different places.

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,810
Every time my copy of it is updated,
everyone else's copy of it has, has,

15
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:53,010
has got to be updated.

16
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:57,360
And then then there's various bells and
whistles like sharding where you know,

17
00:00:57,361 --> 00:01:00,750
it can be broken in many pieces and
each piece is stored many places or

18
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:05,130
something. So That's a distributed ledger
and that's just distributed computing.

19
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:05,964
Now what?

20
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:11,040
What makes it more interesting is when
you layered decentralized control onto

21
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:11,580
that.

22
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,380
So imagine you have this distributed
excel spreadsheet or distributed database.

23
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,640
There's copies of it stored in a
thousand places, but to update it,

24
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,140
you need like 500 of those thousand
people who own the copies to vote. Yeah,

25
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:26,390
let's do that update,
right?

26
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,350
So then then you have a distributed store
of data and you have like a democratic

27
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:36,180
voting mechanism to determine when all
those copies can get can get updated

28
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:37,014
together.
Right.

29
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,030
So then then what you have is a data
storage and update mechanism that's

30
00:01:42,031 --> 00:01:46,340
controlled in a democratic way by the
group of participants rather than money

31
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,490
one central controller. And that that
can have all sorts of advantages.

32
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:52,680
I mean for one thing
it means that you know,

33
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:56,460
there's no one controller who can go
rogue and screw with other day without

34
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:57,330
telling anyone.

35
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,620
It also means there's no one who some
lewd taking go hold a gun to their head

36
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:05,190
and shoot them for for what data
updates from aid because the, you know,

37
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:08,400
it's controlled democratically
by bye everybody. Right.

38
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:11,190
It has ramifications in terms of,
you know,

39
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:15,420
legal defensibility and I mean you
could have some people in Iran,

40
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:16,290
some in China,

41
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:21,291
some in the u s and and updates to this
whole distributed data store are made by

42
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,660
democratic decision of all
the participants somewhere
cryptography comes in is

43
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:29,160
when I vote, I don't have to say, yeah,

44
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:32,760
this is Ben Goertzel voting for
this update to be accepted or not.

45
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,310
It's just ID number one,
three, five, seven, two, six,

46
00:02:36,311 --> 00:02:40,710
four and then encryption is used
to make sure that, you know, it's,

47
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:45,711
it's the same guy voting every time that
it claims to be without needing like

48
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,910
your, your passport number or something.
Right. What's ironic about it,

49
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,080
it's probably one of the best ways
ever conceived to actually vote in this

50
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:55,914
country.
Yeah,

51
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,320
sure.
And it would be kind of ironic.

52
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,860
There's a lot of applications
for the [inaudible], right?

53
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:07,460
So there's so that,
I mean that's the core mechanism.

54
00:03:07,461 --> 00:03:12,461
Now where the block chain comes from is
like a data structure where to store the

55
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:14,770
data in this distributed database,

56
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,850
it's stored in a chain of blocks
or each block contains data.

57
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,130
The thing is not every
so-called blockchain system
even uses a chain of blocks

58
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:27,640
and I would like some user,
a tree or a graph of blocks or something.

59
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:30,340
So that term,
I mean it's,

60
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,860
it's an all right term like AI,

61
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,410
like just one of those terms
were stuck with one of the,

62
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,090
it's one of those terms were stuck with,

63
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:41,680
even though it's not quite technically
not quite technically accurate.

64
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,480
I mean any more, I mean cause w w, W, W I
don't know another buzzword for it, right.

65
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,890
What it is is a,

66
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:52,420
it's a distributed ledger with
encryption and decentralized control and

67
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:55,160
blockchain is the buzzword that's
come about for that. Now, what,

68
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,670
what got me interested in blockchain
really is this decentralized control

69
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:04,750
aspect. So my, my wife, who
I've been with for 10 years now,

70
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,090
she dug up recently
something I'd forgotten,

71
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:11,590
which is a webpage and made
in 1995 like a long time ago,

72
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,030
where I'd said,
hey,

73
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:16,950
I'm going to run for president on the
decentralization platforms. Right.

74
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,310
Which I'd completely forgotten that,
that crazy idea. I was very young then.

75
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:24,220
I had no idea what an annoying job
being president would be. Right.

76
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,350
But the,

77
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:31,351
so that the idea of decentralized
control seem very important to me.

78
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:36,040
Back then, which is well before bitcoin
was invented because I could see,

79
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,780
you know, a global brain is evolving on
the planet involving humans, computers,

80
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:45,460
communication devices. And we don't want
this global brain to be controlled by,

81
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,380
by a small elite. We want the
global parent to be controlled in a,

82
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:52,460
in a decentralized way. So,
right. So that, that's really the,

83
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,530
the beauty of this a blockchain
infrastructure. And what,

84
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,610
what got me interested in the practical
technologies of blockchain was really

85
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:05,611
one etherium came out and you add
the notion of a smart contract,

86
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:10,150
which etherium yeah. So
what does that, well,

87
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,890
so the first blockchain
technology was Bitcoin, right?

88
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,550
Which is a well known cryptocurrency.

89
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,240
Now etherium is another cryptocurrency,

90
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:23,390
which is the number two cryptocurrency
right now. That's all a loop I am.

91
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,350
Did you know about it? He did. However,

92
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:31,070
ethereum came along with a
really nice software framework.

93
00:05:31,071 --> 00:05:35,560
So it's not just like a
digital money like bitcoin is,

94
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,671
but it theory,

95
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:41,671
IOM has a programming language called
solidity that came with it and this

96
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:46,000
programming language, let's see, right,
where they're called smart contracts.

97
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,320
And again,

98
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:51,070
that sort of a misnomer because the
smart contract doesn't have to be either

99
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:54,970
smart or a contract, right? But
it was a cool name, right? Right.

100
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,170
Then if it's really a smart,
it's a chart.

101
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,140
It's like a programmable transaction.
Okay.

102
00:06:02,141 --> 00:06:06,620
So you can program a legal contract
or you can program of a financial

103
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:10,970
transaction. So as a
smart contract, it's a,

104
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,240
it's a persistent piece of software
that embodies like a secure encrypted

105
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:19,400
transaction between,
between multiple parties.

106
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,400
So pretty much like anything on,

107
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:27,410
on the back end of a bank's website
or a transaction between two companies

108
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:32,540
online, a purchasing relationship,
which you and the website online.

109
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,770
This could all be scripted in the
smart contract in this secure way.

110
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,770
And then it would be automated
and it's simple and standard way.

111
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:44,771
So the vision that Vitalik Buterin who
was the main creator behind the theory

112
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:49,841
I'm head is to basically make the
internet into a giant computing mechanism

113
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:55,610
rather than mostly like an information
storage and retrieval mechanism,

114
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,130
make the Internet into a giant computer,

115
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,840
but making a really simple programming
language for scripting transactions among

116
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:06,320
different computers and different
parties on the Internet where you have

117
00:07:06,321 --> 00:07:10,880
encryption and you have democratic
decision making and distributed storage of

118
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:14,720
information like programmed into
this, this world computer. Right?

119
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:17,990
And then that was a really cool idea.
And the,

120
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:22,190
and blockchain and solidity programming
language made it really easy to do that.

121
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:27,191
So it made it really easy to program
like distributed secure transaction and

122
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:31,640
computing systems on the Internet.
So I saw this, I thought,

123
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:36,641
well like now we finally have the tool
set that's needed to implement some of

124
00:07:38,151 --> 00:07:40,850
the sources is very popular.
I mean,

125
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:46,090
I mean basically almost every ICO that
was done the last couple of years was

126
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:51,380
done on the ethereum blockchain. What's
an ICO? Initial coin offering. Okay.

127
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:52,490
So for Bitcoins,

128
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,520
for crypto currencies use
this technology offerings.

129
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,241
Right?

130
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:04,241
So what happened in the last couple of
years is a bunch of people realized you

131
00:08:04,821 --> 00:08:09,821
could use this etherium programming
framework to create a new cryptocurrency

132
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,260
like a new artificial money and then you
could try to get people to use your new

133
00:08:18,261 --> 00:08:22,370
artificial money for certain
types of Honi artificial coins.

134
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:27,120
Maybe more,
but I mean how many popular is bitcoin?

135
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:32,490
Bitcoin is bitcoin is by far the most
popular delirium is number two and there's

136
00:08:33,441 --> 00:08:34,280
a bunch of others.

137
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:38,540
I mean how quick comparison like how
much bigger is bitcoin and ethereum?

138
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:40,610
I Dunno,

139
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:45,590
five factor factor of three to
five so maybe just a factor of two.

140
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:50,591
Now it's actually last year at theory
I'm almost took over bitcoin when bitcoin

141
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:54,370
are crashing. Yeah, yeah.
Now I him is back down.

142
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,830
It might be half or a
third of that for you,

143
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,590
the fluctuating value of these
things to my, to my mind,

144
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,920
creating artificial monies is one tiny
bit of the potential of what you could do

145
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:12,420
with the whole blockchain tool set it.

146
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,140
It happened to become popular initially,
right,

147
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,880
because it's where the money is,
right? I've been right. It is.

148
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:25,440
It is money and that's interesting
to people. But on the other hand,

149
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,490
what it's really about is
making the world's computer,

150
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:32,880
it's about scripting with a
simple programming language,

151
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:37,050
all sorts of transactions between people,
companies,

152
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,400
whatever, all sorts of exchanges
of information. So I'm,

153
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,070
it's about decentralized
voting mechanisms.

154
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:49,071
It's about Ai's being able to send data
and processing it for each other and,

155
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,570
and pay each other for their
transactions. So I'm in the, there's,

156
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,020
it's about automating supply chains and,

157
00:09:56,021 --> 00:10:00,820
and shipping and ecommerce
so that there's, in essence,

158
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,710
you know,

159
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:06,690
just like computers and the Internet
started with a certain small set of

160
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:10,290
applications and then pervaded
almost everything, right?

161
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,250
It's the same way with
blockchain technology, like it
started with digital money,

162
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:19,550
but the core technology is going to
pervade almost everything because there's

163
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:24,921
almost no domain of human pursuit that
couldn't use like security through

164
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,910
cryptography, some sort of, you know,

165
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:32,820
participatory decision making and then
distributed storage of information. Right?

166
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:35,610
So,
and these things are also valuable for AI,

167
00:10:35,611 --> 00:10:40,050
which is how I got into it in the first
place. I mean, if you're making a very,

168
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:44,040
very powerful AI that is going to,
you know,

169
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,290
gradually through the
practical value delivers,

170
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,390
he will grow up to be more and
more and more intelligent. I mean,

171
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,990
this AI should be able to engage a
large party of people and ais and

172
00:10:54,991 --> 00:10:58,980
participatory decision making. They,
I should be able to store information,

173
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,490
you know,
when a widely distributed way and,

174
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,400
and AI certainly should be able to use,
you know,

175
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:08,880
security and encryption devalidate
who are the parties in involved in its

176
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:11,700
operation. And I mean, these
are the key things behind,

177
00:11:11,701 --> 00:11:13,170
behind blockchain technology.

178
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:18,000
So I'm in the fact the
fact that blockchain began
with artificial currencies,

179
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:21,480
to me is a detail of history.
Just like the fact,

180
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:25,320
the fact that the Internet began as like
a nuclear early warning system, right?

181
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,920
It did. It's good for that,
but it's, as it happens,

182
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:31,350
it's also even better for
a lot of other things.
