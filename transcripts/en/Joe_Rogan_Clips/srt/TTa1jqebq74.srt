1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,830
Suge knight gear May,
you know what else in my body does?

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,600
If I'm in a room and I'm supposed to
be awake, you ever get like sleepy?

3
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:13,650
Sometimes if I get sleepy,
my Dick would get hard.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,160
It's like,
it's like my biggest look out

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,540
around the
area.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,650
Well sometimes I'll be in writers'
rooms that I get sleepy and my and start

7
00:00:27,651 --> 00:00:28,550
getting hungry.
Oh fuck.

8
00:00:28,551 --> 00:00:31,100
So then I'll try to go to the
bathroom to throw board on my face.

9
00:00:31,101 --> 00:00:33,410
But now I'm slightly
like a wreck getting up.

10
00:00:33,411 --> 00:00:37,520
So making sure nobody's looking at me
right. Like some freak. Yeah. Yeah.

11
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:40,590
So I'm like always in there. Always
pull my shit down. But isn't that funny?

12
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:45,060
Like everybody knows you get an erection.
Everybody knows you get erection. Right.

13
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,290
But if they get an erection near
that, I'm like, what the fuck? I know.

14
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,230
I know I had a boner. Sorry. Sorry.
It's human nature, but you can't,

15
00:00:55,231 --> 00:00:59,010
especially in mixed company.
Yeah, yeah. Especially today. Nah,

16
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:00,540
you can't day to day,
man.

17
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,980
Just think about all the sexual harassment
that people just sort of like that

18
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:09,360
was there the way they behaved.
Yeah. Yeah. The office,

19
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:12,880
that was their thing.
And now you see now you can't do that.

20
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,540
Why they went to the office,

21
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,660
like they couldn't wait to get the
work to chase whomever was there,

22
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,440
pinch the secretary and a blood.
Um, I mean it's, you know,

23
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:26,730
my mom had a thing like that when I
was a kid. I didn't understand it,

24
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,740
but somebody was, you know, she needed
the job. So what I will say to, you know,

25
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:33,060
um,

26
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,920
women watching what my mom did and she
just kept elaborate notes so that cause

27
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:41,460
she knew it was gonna be his
word against hers. And you know,

28
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:44,940
predators don't keep notes,
man. They don't keep note of it.

29
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,740
So mom was like October
8th, Duh Duh, Duh, Duh.

30
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,070
They, you know, she was
protected and so, wow,

31
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,220
just don't try to go off memory
like that. You know, if the shit,

32
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,360
even if you're keep notes man, still
you against them. Yeah it still is.

33
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:04,620
But back then boss, whoa, but
still once you, cause that's how,

34
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,760
who I think, who had somebody
else had no, the Weinstein thing.

35
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:12,200
Somebody kept like notes and
that's why I mean, cause you,

36
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,480
when you have a lot of money you can
definitely litigate it. Like it is.

37
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,270
I'm sue under the law. But
when something like, you know,

38
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,250
and I think his legal team looked at it,
they were like,

39
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,180
you better go to Europe for some deep
counseling cause deep. However they,

40
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,940
you know, Europe counseling,
it's a different level.

41
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,160
That's the leave the continent.
Right. Hey my head on straight.

42
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:35,840
I'm gonna stay over here. Yeah, I had be
able to do that. It's crazy. Well look,

43
00:02:35,841 --> 00:02:40,070
if you look at like the Kevin Spacey
thing, like that's how he would run a set.

44
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,690
Apparently he'd be on the set and
he'd just be grabbing dicks. Yeah.

45
00:02:44,691 --> 00:02:47,660
That's what they're all saying. I
mean, I don't know if that's the truth,

46
00:02:47,661 --> 00:02:49,400
but all the people in
the house of cards set,

47
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,300
this is what all the complaints are coming
out was that he would like grab guys

48
00:02:53,301 --> 00:02:56,840
dicks that we're taking them places and
he'd have like a PA that had to take him

49
00:02:56,841 --> 00:02:59,650
somewhere. He reached in his pants and
grabbed his dick. He was just a dick.

50
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,320
Gregory grabbed,
um,

51
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,300
whose dick was it that he grabbed like
some famous dude, uh, Richard Dreyfus.

52
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,110
He grabbed his son's Dick
and with him in the room, ah,

53
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:16,160
he was just a crazy dick rubber
stop maniacs. Crazy wrong.

54
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:20,480
Dick grabbing off the reservation.
Ah,

55
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,430
and I think this is their social
environment as well as their working

56
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:27,640
environment, right? They're constantly
around all these people and they're,

57
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,090
they're in this king roll.
Yay.

58
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,940
If you're a star of a show that you're
the executive producer of and it's a

59
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:38,020
giant hit for Netflix and you're the king.
I'm Frank Underwood,

60
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,220
the king of House of cards and all
the people rely on you for their jobs.

61
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,640
This is one of the things they're
saying about house of cards is that 2000

62
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:49,250
people could be out of a job.
Exactly. Which is crazy. Yeah.

63
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,170
So this guy was like at the epicenter,
like he was the,

64
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,980
the king of 2000 people.
So he would show up at work and you know,

65
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:01,110
see his ego,
grab your ticket,

66
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,850
the king,
you know.

67
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:08,350
And I think that is like
natural male predatory behavior.

68
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,910
I think when a man gets into a position
where he's the king and all these people

69
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,680
[inaudible] maybe we
get you something sire.

70
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,500
Like if you're on a set and
you're like the big star,

71
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,280
all these people are
stumbling around sire. Maybe,

72
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,710
maybe we get you something sire.
Like you start thinking like a king.

73
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,360
Like if you're Harvey Weinstein,

74
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:27,160
like think about all the people
that cover it up for him.

75
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,610
He had it written in his
contract was crazy. I mean,

76
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:34,480
but also just think of that work
ethic man. Like you know what I mean?

77
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,320
He like to work that hard.

78
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,760
And then the part that trips me out is
when people would show up to the victims

79
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:46,270
ago, tell me everything we're going
to, we're going to take them down.

80
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:49,810
And then those people were investigators.
Did they go, I work for Weinstein Bitch.

81
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:51,250
Like you better not,

82
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,370
you know how fucked up it has to
have you walking around in the world.

83
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:59,800
But they're predators, man. And
they look for like, you know,

84
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:03,580
it's this weird shit, but
it's like if you, you know,

85
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,880
they had like a parent or something like,
come on baby, do you think it's safe to,

86
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,680
you know, meet with him at three in the
morning and they were like, mama is cool.

87
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,080
It's going to be fine. Trust me.
Why don't you trust me? You know?

88
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:15,460
And then when something happens,

89
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,390
they feel like they can't say
anything because they don't want the,

90
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:23,440
I told you so. Or they don't want to,
oh well, whatever it is. And then that,

91
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:27,430
that moment can turn into two weeks
and not saying a year, six month,

92
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:28,800
then you living, you
know what I mean? And,

93
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:33,760
and so that's how it can happen
when you're just so embarrassed,

94
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,660
you know what I mean?

95
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,110
Or you don't want to embarrass
or hurt other people at times.

96
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,900
Sometimes people don't say anything
because they don't want to make their

97
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:43,660
parents feel what type
of way, you know? Yeah.

98
00:05:43,661 --> 00:05:48,661
There's a lot on a lot of women that
had been rape victims that the stigma of

99
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:53,470
being a rape victim,
excuse me, publicly is a,

100
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,200
it's so hard. It's so terrifying.
They don't even, they'll like,

101
00:05:57,201 --> 00:06:01,700
I'll just let it slide. It's, and it's,
it's like man, it's horrible. It's,

102
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,770
I mean,
so I'm personally,

103
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:08,480
I'm happy that people are
finally speaking, you know,

104
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:11,350
coming out. Cause it's, it's,
it's a lot of jobs open and up.

105
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,130
I'm really happy that people are
finding that courage to just, you know,

106
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,790
speak that truth and hope we'll see
what happens on the other side of it.

107
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,210
Will we be a healthier society?
Well,

108
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,070
I've been saying this for a while that
I think that eventually we're going to

109
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:28,190
get to a point we could read each other's
minds. I really think that's on the,

110
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:29,270
on the horizon.

111
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,110
I think it's just a matter of time before
no one can ever do anything like that

112
00:06:33,111 --> 00:06:33,920
ever again.

113
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,910
And I think that's what you're seeing
now with like this Harvey Weinstein Shit

114
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:39,620
and the Kevin Spacey Shit
and all this other stuff.

115
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,800
I mean you see varying degrees of it.
Some of them seem pretty innocuous.

116
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:46,200
Like Al Franken just likes to grab butts
when he takes a picture. It's like, ah,

117
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,790
not the best practice,
but not the worst thing in the world.

118
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,650
But I think we're going to get to a point
where all of this is look back on like

119
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,850
wearing powdered wigs or slavery or
any crazy old shit that we just don't

120
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:02,510
tolerate anymore and just nutty
behavior that you just can't do anymore.

121
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,290
I think we're going to get to a point
where you're going to be able to talk to

122
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:09,720
someone and you're going to be able to
see what's going on in their head and you

123
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,540
will, you would have to be a
real piece of shit to victimize

124
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,000
gross. I gotta stop. You
know what's interesting too,

125
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:27,440
I think this is a direct reaction to
us not communicating with one another.

126
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,870
You know what I mean?
It's a day like today,

127
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:32,930
like everything is texts like my
boys at a single day, you know,

128
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,180
they getting girls to texts, like,
have you talked to her yet? Now Ryan,

129
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,740
but she's sending me like all of this,
the number. So you're not really, yeah.

130
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:43,520
And then I think can be taken out of
context, what have you, but, but yeah,

131
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:45,920
it is getting to the place where you're
going to have to be really clear with

132
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:49,880
your intentions, like American to see
it. You can be OCD tension. Some people.

133
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:50,480
Oh Wow.

134
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,990
You know another thing I think that is
ridiculous and I'm not pro prostitution,

135
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:58,070
but I think it should be legal and I
think if it was legal you would have way

136
00:07:58,071 --> 00:08:01,370
less of this gone. Oh yeah. Wanelo
yeah. Cause that's what it is, right?

137
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,910
It's just that release and people need
to craziness. It's forbidden shit.

138
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,620
There's a lot,
there's a lot of factors going on.

139
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:11,660
But I think one of the things that would
change is that people that want like

140
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,870
ugly dudes like Harvey Weinstein, it just
wants sex and he could just go get it.

141
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,080
But I think for him it's like a power
thing to definitely mean he was banging

142
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,780
all those really hot like famous chicks.

143
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,080
This drug dealer told me a long time ago,
it was two things.

144
00:08:24,081 --> 00:08:28,400
He's talking about men. It says
two things, man. Understand
as weapon or a secret.

145
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:34,400
And if you came with they ass,
you better get a secret. So,

146
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,070
and that's uh,
you know,

147
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:41,750
I feel like Harvey doing that shit to a
lot of people because they became huge

148
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:45,440
stars. There's no reason for them
to ever have to respect him again.

149
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,280
You know what I mean? But he was like,
yeah, but you, you know what this is,

150
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:52,700
you know, take my whatever,
whatever his, well apparently he,

151
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,700
he wouldn't negotiate it into
deals. He would say, if you fuck me,

152
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,270
you'll get more lines. You'll get
parts who get this and get that.

153
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,830
And so it's like, I mean, but
that is like my main was like,

154
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:09,780
so what, when do you know your worth?
Right. And when you know, well,

155
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:11,760
if you, you know what I mean? I'm good.

156
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:15,660
I don't need this here
over here or I've already,

157
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,650
the work I've already done like my,

158
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,320
my last work paid for all this shit.
Where are you getting your money?

159
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,540
You're getting your money from
something I did. You know what I mean?

160
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,250
Like instead of thinking about it like,

161
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,750
oh you can give me more money
cause like you sitting on this,

162
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,980
you got this sweet from my performance.
You know what I mean? Like right.

163
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:39,090
This dude wrote you didn't do shit like
literally came up with this guy wrote it.

164
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,120
This guy shot it. Yeah. Yeah you ain't,
that's what's interesting. He's like,

165
00:09:42,121 --> 00:09:46,620
he's not the creative guy at all. No, no.
Just the money guy that fucks the women.

166
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:50,820
Yeah. It's weird. It's weird
man. It's weird how long
you got away with it for it.

167
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,590
For decade after decade after
decade. It's, it's, it's crazy man.

168
00:09:55,591 --> 00:10:00,030
It's almost like the floating like
every person that you look at like,

169
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,600
Oh man, that person doesn't know. It
shocked me the most about Matt Lauer.

170
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:08,690
That motherfucker was making $20 million
year 25 I heard it was 2,500 2028

171
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:14,140
years. 28 and they had to
pay him. They had to pay him,

172
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,920
pay him out after the last contract.
They said I was just reading.

173
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,370
They don't know if it's going to be
finished. There was 2018 contract,

174
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,270
but he also was getting
flown a helicopter rides too,

175
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:28,200
is like a Hamptons house so we could
spend more time with his family or

176
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:33,201
something in between dam outlet or
meetings as to what would happen.

177
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,360
All of them. All those cats get paid out
though. What's the Charlie Rose Gate?

178
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,740
When he had to step out, did he
get paid out? But he was on PBS.

179
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,840
It probably wasn't getting paid.
Riley got a lot of extra money. Right?

180
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:48,650
Riley paid 30 $35 million in a
sexual harassment settlement.

181
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:54,010
What the fuck could you have possibly
done? Just think about it. In fact,

182
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,880
they're like, okay, okay, I'll give
you 35 million. You shut the fuck up.

183
00:10:56,881 --> 00:11:01,470
Like 5 million is a j Lo House. Hold
up though, Joe. This is fucked up.

184
00:11:01,471 --> 00:11:04,950
But that victim should
be a motivational speaker

185
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:11,030
that motivates. Yeah. Talk to
other victims that I had to pay.

186
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:15,720
First thing I did was I limped around,
then I pretended I couldn't walk good. And

187
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:21,630
I always get nervous. I'd have to
sit down 35 I appeared vulnerable.

188
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:25,110
It worked out. Yeah. Oh, that's,
I mean that's wonder what he did.

189
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,150
I mean it was just one,
I mean another one,

190
00:11:27,151 --> 00:11:31,380
I think he paid a 12 there was like
several different ones that he had to pay

191
00:11:31,381 --> 00:11:36,000
off. Like this guy was on a rampage for
years and years. Yeah. He's a trick man.

192
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:40,500
He was on the streets. He's a trick
that pays well. He's a house money.

193
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,710
35,000,035 come on man.

194
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:48,030
And everybody already knows you're a
freak. So it's like you wasted 35 million.

195
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:52,320
Like everybody knows you're a freak. Yeah.
And so who do we, where do you start?

196
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:56,290
Like is it the platform who, who gave
them the platform and that guy, you know,

197
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:57,580
I think it's a bunch of things,

198
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,410
but one of the things that I think it
is is that that world is so sexually

199
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:05,680
charged.
All the men are like these powerful,

200
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:09,970
wealthy men and all the women are hot
as fuck and the off short skirts on and

201
00:12:09,971 --> 00:12:11,230
they're all talking about like,

202
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:15,760
like American value and it's
all conservative values.

203
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:20,761
It's all super simple brass to right
behind closed doors as button popping.

204
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:25,950
And fucking
crazy snoring.

205
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:30,520
I see lips, Woo. Maca

206
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:36,760
being a PA, Chrissy. That's
what's so puritanical. Tuto man,

207
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,553
they don't teach,

208
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:43,830
they don't teach six education like to
younger kids is never cool to talk about

209
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:48,970
this shit. So there's definitely
that. But it's also the suppression,

210
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,330
the ones that are like super religious,
super suppressed.

211
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:56,290
Those are the ones that have this date.
You have a need for an outlet. Of course.

212
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,590
Yes. Yeah. And I feel like
it's, it's equal. Right?

213
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,640
So the amount that you put out,
you equally have,

214
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,520
you know what I mean? Like
that. Uh, who was that guy?

215
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,060
The senator or congressman with the
fuck it was, it just got busted like uh,

216
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,480
having, he was an anti gay. Oh yes.

217
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,890
And he turns out he was, he
got busted having sex with
a dude in his office. Yeah.

218
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,030
Inappropriate behavior. And
they called it, they had,

219
00:13:22,031 --> 00:13:24,180
it was very convenient
and they give him the x.

220
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:29,280
Here he is anti Lgbtq lawmaker
resigns over gay sex scandal.

221
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:34,690
Republican state,
Ohio State Representative Wesley.

222
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:39,280
Oh, Wesley Wesley Goodman. He may have
also previously assaulted an 18 year old.

223
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:44,470
Hey, hey, assaulted. Is it like Kevin
Spacey type of salt? Like Dick Grabbing?

224
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:48,730
No To word assault is, oh
man. Words are violent. Hello?

225
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,540
Your words are violence
touch you? No, no, no.

226
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,070
Your words are violence.
Okay.
