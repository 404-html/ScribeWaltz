1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,540
Heads and it's a star wars
one at Disneyland, Dude.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,060
It's fucking why you go across,
you're walking across you,

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,550
you can really get a workout with that.
I'm not joking. You get exhausted. Yeah.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,850
And you know, you, you keep
going and fight tougher and
tougher opponents, right?

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,690
Well, yeah, that's it. And
that's the quite, you know,

6
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:19,950
so like talk about haptic suits,

7
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:22,500
like where eventually you know you're
going to wear things. I didn't see the,

8
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:26,480
I read the book but I didn't see the,
uh, what was it? The movie that ready,

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,320
set ready player one.
I didn't see it either.

10
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:29,310
They didn't see you
have you read the book?

11
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:31,410
The book's really good because
the book is like full immersion.

12
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:34,530
Like the whole book is about
like when virtual reality is it.

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,500
And so everybody has the suits that, you
know, and you're kind of in this ball,

14
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:41,400
you play the game in a boiler, you can run
and you know, um, but in some sense, yes,

15
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:44,970
we're just starting out along these lines,
but they have these places you can go,

16
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,670
they have a warehouse set
up and you go inside of it.

17
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,430
And I went through one with my kids.

18
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,580
And it's a star wars one at Disneyland,
Dude.

19
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,320
It's fucking why you go across,
you're walking across this platform,

20
00:00:58,321 --> 00:01:01,410
like they have all these different places
where you actually walk through and as

21
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:04,350
you're walking through, you look to the
left and to the right and there's fire,

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,740
but you feel the heat from the fire.
It's fucking crazy.

23
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,790
Like heater set up so that it blows up
and storm troopers starts shooting at you.

24
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:15,360
This is it right here. What is it
called? The void. The void. Yeah.

25
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,940
And you do this.
I'm telling you man,

26
00:01:17,941 --> 00:01:21,240
this is better than any of the rides
at Disneyland and it's just outside of

27
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:23,160
Disneyland and downtown Disney.

28
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,310
So you don't have to pay to get into
Disney and you get it. But it costs,

29
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,140
I think it's $35 for a half an hour.
It's not cheap, but it's not too bad.

30
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,130
It's not too bad. Like it's fucking
awesome. I mean it is awesome.

31
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,700
And so the question is what happens
with all of this, right? Future, right?

32
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:40,590
Cause you have virtual reality.
We're just on the cusp of it. Right.

33
00:01:40,591 --> 00:01:43,680
We're just beginning to like start
playing around with these technologies

34
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:45,450
because people have been saying it
for years and it kind of sucked.

35
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:49,350
It was sort of clunky. We're,
we used to play Pong, right?

36
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,690
That's what I started with. How old are
you? 55 yeah, I'm 50 so I remember Pong.

37
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:57,540
We were excited.
I can't believe I'm controlling the TV,

38
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,520
making the thing move on the TV
or asteroids slew the, Oh yeah.

39
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,290
Was a star wars game,
I think it was called asteroids.

40
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:09,210
But you flew through the trenches
wire frame, but it was amazing.

41
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,460
I dropped a lot of quarters.
Sure.

42
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,050
So go from that to what you were showing
us here with these crazy new space

43
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:20,160
games. And then imagine what these
mean. The star wars thing today,

44
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:25,020
the void is really cool, but you know
that it's not real, but it's cool.

45
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,230
Right. But you know it's not real. Well,
you're not going to be able to tell.

46
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,030
It's not real in 20 years. Yeah. Right.

47
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:33,090
And how much time are you willing to
spend it, by the way, when you do that?

48
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:37,080
Oh really pressure you and you feel
it when you get getting shot. Wow.

49
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,440
You feel like, I never,
you know, it's funny,

50
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:44,490
even with the controller on my
crappy ps four who, um, yeah,

51
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:47,490
but it vibrates when you,
you know, sort of give you,

52
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,640
it's amazing how much the brain sort of
picks up on these signals when you're

53
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:54,720
using the HTC vive and you draw an Arrow
back. When it gets to the nocking point,

54
00:02:54,721 --> 00:02:58,010
you feel it, like you release,

55
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,480
there's a feeling in your hand and you're
seeing the arrow. It's really cool.

56
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,850
Yeah. So what happens when, and you're
right, I can be sorta like, you know,

57
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,050
you're like, that's terrible. People
shouldn't be going out in nature,

58
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:11,380
which I think they should be. They should,
you know, now, but, you know, I always,

59
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:14,260
I'm always aware whenever I'm sort of
like, oh shit, this is gonna be terrible.

60
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:17,020
I always remember the whole, you can
see it in like, I think at some point,

61
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:21,100
Socrates, you know, 2005 years,
500 years ago, it was like,
Ooh, kids to do the role.

62
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:25,510
Bunch of old. Right. Um, so you know, who
knows what we'll do with it and you know,

63
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:27,960
hopefully, you know, maybe it'll help,
you know, maybe, I don't know. You know,

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,550
I mean I think there is, I don't
want to be like, oh that's terrible,

65
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:34,150
but there clearly are is going to be
dangerous with just a different game.

66
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,170
Jamie this is a new one. Oh boy. Fuck I,

67
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,850
I'm going to be fucked shooting at
these yet. Just the hands. Yeah.

68
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,290
And so your,

69
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,680
you have two little hand controllers and
one of them would be the Arrow and the

70
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:50,290
other one would be the bow and you wear
them and that's the haptic part and

71
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,940
it'll controllers on them.

72
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:56,920
Well you feel the Arrow vibrating against
the riser of the row as you draw it

73
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:59,110
back to.
It's really cool.

74
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,750
Well it's funny cause you know
we talked about like you know,

75
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:03,630
for the the game that we built,
which was awesome.

76
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,840
It was really a lot of fun to actually go
through the process of like how do you,

77
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,740
how do you script it? How do you
teach people, you know, like,

78
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,210
cause that whole thing that when we get
in a good way, when you're a good game,

79
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:13,750
right?
You know,

80
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,990
the first couple hours of a game and
you're just learning the basic stuffs and

81
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:20,090
you get excited, you're like, oh this
is, this is a cool world to be in. Um,

82
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,950
but I'd be interested to
think like sort of, you know,

83
00:04:21,951 --> 00:04:25,150
at some point did tried VR for the
same thing because what can you,

84
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:28,000
once you can tap, have people be tactile
and then have to sort of in their head,

85
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,880
what else can you do to short of show
them, teach them things you know,

86
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:33,150
like glaciers or you know,
I mean sure.

87
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,760
Well that's another thing in Disneyland
they have a thing called soaring over

88
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:39,470
the world that you sit in a chair and you,

89
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:43,510
you get raised up and there's a giant
like imax style screen and it flies you

90
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:45,700
over these environments.
It's incredible.

91
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:49,930
It's so beautiful and different smells
are in the air and the different places

92
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:51,930
that you go to.
Like when you go over the elephant,

93
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,930
the elephant's you smell
grass and hay. And, um,

94
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,790
I think that it's just a matter of time,

95
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,650
like as we were talking about before
where biological entities might not be

96
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:05,380
necessary for space travel.
You might be able to send a robot,

97
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:09,250
put on a suit and be able to experience
these worlds, right? Like in real time.

98
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,330
Well, um, so you know, you
know, the simulation argument,

99
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,940
the philosophy argued about the,
you know,

100
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,590
and so that's a really interesting idea.

101
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:20,950
Should we just run through it for people
who don't know, so I forgot who it was,

102
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:24,130
Nick Bostrom and now maybe not Brandon
Carter. You know, there's this, uh,

103
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,390
this guy philosopher came with
this brilliant argument for like,

104
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,710
why we're probably a simulant,
we're probably somebody else's simulation,

105
00:05:30,711 --> 00:05:33,720
self aware of simulation. And the idea
is like, look, if you get one, you know,

106
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:37,150
we've been talking about
like civilizations, when they
get a million years ahead,

107
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,490
what can they do that they're so powerful,

108
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:42,750
they can build computers
that can simulate reality,

109
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:45,220
like fully simulate reality where like,
you know, just like in the matrix,

110
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,620
you have programs that are
self aware and so, you know,

111
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:51,130
once they get to that and they start
running simulations of the world, right?

112
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,580
It's cheaper to run.
It's cheap to run simulations.

113
00:05:53,581 --> 00:05:55,270
So they just run trillions of them,
right?

114
00:05:55,271 --> 00:06:00,271
So the idea is that from that argument
there's more simulated realities then

115
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:04,610
there is the one real reality.
So odds are right, you know,

116
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:07,670
if there's a trillion simulated
realities and one real reality,

117
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,270
you're probably in a simulated
reality. So are we a, you know,

118
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,090
everything like right now you, and
I think this is real, you know,

119
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,920
but what we are is an incredibly detailed
and we are self aware programs in

120
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,350
silicon matrix of, you know, uh,
so that argument is brilliant.

121
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:25,730
I mean, you know, I mean just from the,

122
00:06:25,731 --> 00:06:28,850
just from the point of view
of like numbers, um, yeah,

123
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,790
there's lots of reasons to say that's
not possible, but, but it's, you know,

124
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,310
raises this issue of like,
yeah, what is simulation?

125
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,230
But if you are in a simulation,
the whole matrix thing,

126
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,780
if you are in a simulation that was
that real, how would you know? Yeah,

127
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,950
how could you know there are gay,
we're going to be,

128
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:45,190
if you allow technology to continue,
right?

129
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,990
If we keep moving forward
at an exponential pace,

130
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,540
there's gonna come a point in
time what we have something that's

131
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,220
indistinguishable from reality,
right?

132
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,610
So how do we know that we're not
already in it? Once we're in it,

133
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,200
will we create another reality?

134
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,270
Will we continue to create simulations
inside of simulations like fractals,

135
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,610
fractals exist nature, they exist
everywhere in the universe. And there's,

136
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,430
there's also the argument that the
atomic structure itself might really be a

137
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,540
universe. Right? Right. Yeah.

138
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,560
That's super stoner talk. But you
know, it's really, I mean, what,

139
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,480
that's why I love science fiction, you
know, the explorations of these ideas,

140
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,160
you know, I mean they're way out there
and there, but know exercises, exercises.

141
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:26,210
And there's a way in which again,

142
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:29,390
when you think 1,000,002 million years
in the future, this is why might one of,

143
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:31,670
you know, I hate the loop this back
to climate change, but just like God,

144
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:34,730
if we could just make it through,
who the fuck knows what we're going to be.

145
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,910
Right. I mean there's, there's the whole
universe. One thing I did like about, um,

146
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,200
interstellar, what's the idea
that like our future selves,

147
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:45,860
which have now become integrated,
the very fabric of reality, you know,

148
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,090
that's how far you've evolved.

149
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:51,180
You become the laws of
physics that they're kind of
opening up the wormhole for

150
00:07:51,181 --> 00:07:52,430
us. And so, you know,

151
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:57,431
a million years is so long and that know
who knows what we can become and it's

152
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:01,160
just like, you know, don't hold
us back. I mean, I'm, you know,

153
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:05,030
I'm not a fan of the
people that deny science,

154
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:08,030
but one thing I am a fan
of is watching them do it.

155
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,930
Like watching monkeys
throw shit at the zoo.

156
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,430
It's just something weird about watching
people argue like really obvious,

157
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:20,000
right wing talking points and,
and, and most of them, by the way,

158
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:24,710
have no financial interest in
climate change one way or the other.

159
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:27,260
They're not,
they're not the wealthy elite.

160
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,920
There are these Weirdos that are like
the empire familiars like they want to be

161
00:08:30,921 --> 00:08:34,520
recognized as like an eight,
an ally of the elite.

162
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:36,220
They think somehow knew that
that was going to get to,

163
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,100
and it's really what it is, right? Yeah.
