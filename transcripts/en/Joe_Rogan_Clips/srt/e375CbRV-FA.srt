1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,390
Ha. You know, you have to think
about all these things. I mean,

2
00:00:03,391 --> 00:00:05,550
I do think since Trump got elected,

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,540
conspiracy theorist had been
demonized and nobody talks about that.

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,430
There's a little bit, well,
I was always going on.

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,340
It was even before that there were
being demonized. But yeah, for sure.

6
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:16,440
Everybody's worried about the
other groups, which is fair.

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:20,430
I get that there's the people in the
cages. No good. I'm not for any of that.

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,760
People in the cage, they will. The kids in
the cages is not good. What do you mean?

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,360
The family separation. Oh,
water. All the cores. Real stuff.

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,980
But I think that people think that
conspiracy theories got Trump elected,

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:37,490
so now it's cool to hate conspiracy
theorists or people that are like,

12
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:38,940
let's take another look at this.

13
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:43,680
There's so many factors that got Trump
elected and it's a perfect storm of

14
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,100
people getting, getting fed up
with political correctness. Yeah.

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,490
Someone coming along that's
not a politician. You know,

16
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:55,020
the system is so rigged that after
a while you just like Jesus Christ.

17
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,350
How many more of these fake puppets
were going to put an office? There's,

18
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,610
I say this to comics,
I'm like,

19
00:00:59,611 --> 00:01:03,720
everybody's done a show where everybody
goes at and bombs with their material

20
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,760
and then one guy gets up and just goes,

21
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:10,761
fuck this and screams and
yells and destroys because
that's what the room wanted

22
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:12,031
the whole night.

23
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:16,170
They wanted somebody to come up and just
realize how fucked everything was and

24
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:18,870
how nobody was having a good time.
And that's kind of what Trump was.

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,730
Trump was the guy that came
out and just riffed. Yeah,

26
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,160
he went out there with no material.

27
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:27,330
He just went out there and rift and
he went and, and I, when I heard,

28
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,490
and I'm sure you've seen this speech where
he talks about Ben Carson going after

29
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:35,280
his mother with a hammer and
trying to stab his friend.

30
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,990
This was one of the funniest things.

31
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:40,650
He was speaking and he was given a
stump speech. I don't know where it was.

32
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,830
I think it was, wasn't in Iowa,
but he was referencing Iowa.

33
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,250
And he's talking about Ben Carson's
book and that Ben Carson had admitted to

34
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,920
going after his mother with a hammer
and trying to stab his friend with an,

35
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,070
I mean, these are, these are in
that and Trump is talking about it.

36
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,960
Me and my friend would driving, uh, at in
New York City. We were laughing so hard.

37
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:04,170
I said this guys, I said,
he's going to win. I said,

38
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:05,400
I'll tell you why he's going to win.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,410
I cannot stop watching this.
I can't,

40
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,830
I am so fixated by the idea that there's
a guy like this on the national stage

41
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,800
and he sang whatever he wants.

42
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,120
There was something intoxicating about
that in a lot of the things you were

43
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:26,790
saying were horrible,
but he was saying them.

44
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,060
And then on the other side you had Hillary
Clinton who was just a scripted oh,

45
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:34,860
careful person. And I'm like, you,

46
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,590
it's just boring to me.
I'm like,

47
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:42,360
sometimes he entertaining person wins
because you can't take your eyes off them.

48
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,640
Well, in this case for sure, I mean in
the, that it was a perfect, you know,

49
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,980
polar opposite between him
and her. Yeah. You know, no,

50
00:02:50,981 --> 00:02:54,450
no experience versus vast
amounts of experience.

51
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,890
No real experience in the real world
versus vast amount of experiences.

52
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,610
Yeah. I mean there was a lot going on
between the two of them. It was a, it was,

53
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,330
it's,

54
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:10,330
it's a bad way to choose very old runs
really is very bad to look at candidates

55
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:14,410
and go, who's the most
entertaining? Yeah. Well,

56
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:18,700
it's also a bad idea to have one person,
right? It's a bad idea to have this,

57
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,050
this same system that was in place
back when there was fucking, you know,

58
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,600
a thousand people here. But I
think we've really dealt, like,

59
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:28,840
we have one person that seems
like we have one figurehead,

60
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,770
but we have kind of this permanent
political class of people. Yeah.

61
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:37,120
A nexus of powerful institutions
where you have career politicians,

62
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:38,470
career diplomats,

63
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,490
career military service people
that kind of don't leave.

64
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,000
So I think that's one of the reasons
that we haven't changed the system is

65
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:49,810
because one person
can't ever do that much.

66
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,290
Even though Trump is wild and crazy
and he's done a lot of bad things,

67
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:58,890
I don't think he would be allowed to
deviate from many of the policies like

68
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:03,280
that.
His predecessors had kind of established,

69
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:05,350
I think that like the American government,

70
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:07,330
and that's why this determine
like the deep state,

71
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:12,190
which a lot of people ridicule. It's
an undeniably true thing. I mean,

72
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:17,020
our policies are not just one guy gets
into office and he goes, here's how it is.

73
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,830
Right? I mean, it's the
result of a lot of, you know,

74
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,490
private corporations lobbying,
forming,

75
00:04:24,491 --> 00:04:28,180
all kinds of forming an agenda and
a non democratic way. You know,

76
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,650
they're not accountable at a lot of these,
you know,

77
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,660
people that work at the CIA or the FBI
or the NSA, a lot of them are appointed.

78
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:37,750
They're not elected. Right. We
have no oversight. Um, we have,

79
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:42,400
I think it's 22 intelligence agencies now.
It's only that money.

80
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,020
I mean, it's something absurd.
How many could you name FBI, CIA,

81
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:51,160
NSA? Uh, probably DEA,
DEA, and intelligence.

82
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,860
I wouldn't say it's an intelligence
that they probably have intelligence

83
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:58,410
capabilities. I would
imagine FBI, CIA, Nsa, uh,

84
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:02,140
there's one in yet the dia,
director of intelligence,

85
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,440
the Pentagon. I mean, I don't know if
that's an entire agency, but I think it,

86
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:09,040
I mean I think it has the capabilities,
but we have all of these different,

87
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,001
I don't know if it's 22,

88
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:13,300
but it's a lot and they're all competing
with each other competing because they

89
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:15,850
all want money. They will
want budget. They all want,

90
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:17,320
and that's the thing that people
talking about the deep state.

91
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:21,130
It's like look at them all. Yeah. Look
at these guys. Here they are. Jesus.

92
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,550
Here are all the people that
are listening. Excited. Yeah.

93
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,450
The fucking space troops that we have
space through force that's going to be

94
00:05:28,451 --> 00:05:32,290
good. And why not? Why not a space
for us? We'll eventually, right.

95
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,240
Eventually you're going to
have to have it. Oh yeah.

96
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:35,740
So why not have it now we have,

97
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,250
I don't know what the national
geospatial intelligence thing does.

98
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,580
They can't be any more relevant.
That's based force. Click on that one.

99
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:45,580
National Geospatial Intelligence Agency.

100
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,700
Be any less important
than the space force.

101
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,060
That's who the fuck knows how many
people were working on employs sixteen

102
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,300
thousand sixteen thousand look at that.
Look at their motto.

103
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,150
Scroll down a little bit. Scroll
down. No earth show the way.

104
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,760
Understand the world what founded in
[inaudible] 96 yeah, Clinton probably did.

105
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,740
It's probably where he keeps his
chicks. I mean this, right, but this is,

106
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:10,160
this is what I mean. Like what the hell
are these people doing now? What is it?

107
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:14,870
16,000 employees with their
motto? No, the earth show the way.

108
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:19,100
Understand the world. That sounds like a
year, like on a yoga studios, you know?

109
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:23,240
I mean it's absurd, but they get
billions of dollars to do whatever.

110
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:28,070
Then put that back up there with the
description. Look at it. We're good.

111
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,200
It says there,
it's a,

112
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,490
it's under the United States Department
of Defense and Intelligence Agency of

113
00:06:34,491 --> 00:06:37,880
the United States intelligence community
with the primary mission of collecting,

114
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:43,090
analyzing and distributing geo spatial
intelligence in support of national

115
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:45,500
security. Which is why,
what does that mean?

116
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,100
What the Hell is geospatial intelligence?
I mean, this is what I mean.

117
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:52,880
This is insane. And if any, if you
ask a question, if you go, well,

118
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:56,520
what do these guys do? People yell
at you and they know you're there.

119
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,730
You're a conspiracy theorist
and you don't know this.

120
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,920
I just want to know what
geospatial intelligence is.

121
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,680
It's probably something simple and
now I'm going to look like an idiot.

122
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,640
It says it's intelligence about the
human activity on earth derive from the

123
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:12,670
exploitation and analysis of imagery and
geospatial information that describes

124
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:19,180
assesses and visually depicts physical
features and geographically referenced

125
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:22,010
activities on the Earth.
I mean this is,

126
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,830
I think that's how we
would know like that.

127
00:07:24,831 --> 00:07:27,840
North Korea has a box size satellites,

128
00:07:27,841 --> 00:07:31,970
satellite imagery I guess. Well,
there's probably a satellite agency too.

129
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,590
I think we've uncovered a scam.

130
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:39,020
I think we've uncovered a pretend agency
that nobody in that there's a guy right

131
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:43,790
now panicked in the tape of spatial
16,000 other employees going, shit,

132
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,230
we're going to have to find a real job.

133
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,520
We would study and shipping docs
from space. Yeah, we just got out. It

134
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,030
just got outbid on rogue and
is completely aw shucks mercy.

135
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,880
Not really there. That was an
actress, 100%. That's an actress.

136
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,250
But this is what I mean. If you,
if you look into this stuff,

137
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,150
it starts to get crazy. The amount
of people that are doing things,

138
00:08:08,151 --> 00:08:09,920
we have no idea what
they're doing. I mean, 10,

139
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:14,960
I just did a private Gig at the Bethesda
country club in Maryland. Okay. It's,

140
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,230
you know, I'm still doing it. Private
gigs. Sadly. He got it. You know,

141
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,210
it has got to do what you gotta do.
I gotta do what you gotta do.

142
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,000
I go to the Bethesda
country called Maryland. Um,

143
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:28,810
it's the entire 10 counties
around Washington DC are
the wealthiest counties in

144
00:08:29,061 --> 00:08:31,430
the world. I mean, in our country, they,

145
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:33,860
and it's not because you're selling
crab cakes, you know what I mean?

146
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,500
It's all defense industry,
Raytheon, uh, you know,

147
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:39,890
DynCorp things you've never heard of.
And they're old and they were,

148
00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:42,630
it was a good gig. They were funny. I
got up and I was like, what do we, oh,

149
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,800
we a carving up Venezuela.
They all laughed. We're all
clapping. They're in new it,

150
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,690
you know, they liked it. They some
people get, and I was, like I said,

151
00:08:50,691 --> 00:08:53,360
last week I did a fundraiser
for human trafficking victims.

152
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:56,910
This week I'm with the traffickers. You
guys a lot more fun and they're clapping.

153
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,700
They're clicked, they love it. They're
leaning in to being, that's good.

154
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,370
They're, you know, they're
morally compromise. Well,

155
00:09:05,371 --> 00:09:09,480
there also hired a comedian to fuck with
them. Yes, that's a good point. I mean,

156
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:12,750
they expected, it's not like I came
out of nowhere. Well, you know, I mean,

157
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:14,520
it's like, so that's the
thing. It's like Trump bad,

158
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,720
but I don't know what the geospatial
people are till I don't have to,

159
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,380
I don't want to throw my hat in
with geospatial intelligence. Yeah.

160
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,550
I don't know what that means. I
mean, maybe we need it, you know?

161
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:30,770
But listen again to standup comedians
talking about what the world needs.

162
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,340
Great. It's fucking terrible,
right? I mean, I've been,

163
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:37,770
I've been trying to stress this more than
ever because of the fact that I have a

164
00:09:37,771 --> 00:09:41,940
microphone. Right. And
people are listening. Don't
fucking pay attention to me.

165
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,080
Okay. I am not right. Well, the
best thing is, listen, you know,

166
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:49,020
you don't know you might be right,
right. But I'm definitely not an expert.

167
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,070
The best thing is if you go on Twitter
and a comedian will tweet something

168
00:09:53,071 --> 00:09:56,780
really, you know, it's like we're
living in fascism and again,

169
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:00,480
like 400,000 likes and then the next
tweet, have you ever seen this tickle?

170
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,110
And while you guys are here,
check out my web series

171
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:10,920
and you'd go, are we, are we living in
fat? If we're living in fascism, you too.

172
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:12,840
I have a web series.
You can't have a web series.

173
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:16,380
And do I have the time to
luxuriate in your web series?

174
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,130
Or should I start arming
myself to over throw the gun?

175
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,990
What should I, what should I look at my
phone? I'm like, which way should I go?

176
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,430
But that's all they do. They go by, by the
way, while you're here, I have a patrion.

177
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,760
We're doing a project.
I'd like you to throw a few bucks there,

178
00:10:32,761 --> 00:10:35,070
but we're living in
fascists. I mean, you know.
