1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,200
Do you ever use one of those
teeter inversion tables? Um,

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,340
now I just got something free from
you guys that were in the lobby.

3
00:00:05,341 --> 00:00:08,700
What's that thing called? Pro formas
or whatever. Oh, that's a so, right.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:13,480
That's a so a, so OSC massager.
Isn't that great? So, uh,

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,770
that's this muscle in here.
I'm going to come on that thing and thing.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,160
Feels fucking good brother.
Sorry.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,470
Room and thinking feels good
that you are so horny today.

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,040
I had to dry. It's like 20 minute drive
over right here. Oh, that kitchen morning.

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,640
Get Ivan. Nothing like driving
dude note. I'll say this.

10
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,780
Things that get me a rec these
days, driving, being on planes.

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,680
You know that uh,
bumpy roads

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,770
doing those bumpy roads.
Boners I, there's a real,

13
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,170
you asked me one time
ever they had a lady, uh,

14
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,470
I felt like I got an erection on a
plane and she got pissed. She told the,

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,210
she told the flight attendant to get me
a blanket. Well, did you have it out?

16
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,060
No,
I was asleep and it was in my pants.

17
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,470
It was in your pants and
she saw it somehow. Yeah,

18
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,750
she saw my pants cause I wear lean pants,
lean pants or you know,

19
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:07,790
I wasn't wearing like a like a fat suit
canvas or anything, you know, textiles

20
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:11,843
that

21
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,700
that's crazy that she's
looking over at your race.

22
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,490
But I guess if I was a woman and
a dude had a rock hard boner,

23
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:24,000
just like a couple of fee, I would know.
That's like a ticking time bomb. Like hey,

24
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,990
all right, but I'm on a plane, I'm going
home. Yeah, but what if you're a pervert?

25
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,800
Yeah, I am a pervert but I'm still
just going home and not using my dick.

26
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,100
What kind of scale of
a pervert are you have?

27
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,100
Like 10 is jerking off in front of people
on the subway with a knock that I have

28
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,280
a friend that's a flasher though.

29
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,390
Well you this flashes and it flashes a
jerk off on people. He doesn't do that.

30
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,620
That's 10 and then nine is a flasher that
just pretends to jerk off in front of

31
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,380
you. It doesn't finish.
Yeah or can't get hard.

32
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,160
And then you've got to go back from there.
Seven a softball five.

33
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:01,200
What do you look at? Three? No October

34
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,870
perverted tendencies like would, I guess
it's like what is perverted, you know?

35
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,360
Well it goes back to the porn talk.

36
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:12,780
Like you said that you had a problem with
porn, you were watching too much porn.

37
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,440
It became a habit for me. That's
what I didn't like. It became a,

38
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,960
instead of me wanting to
watch pornography became, oh,

39
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,910
I'm used to watching pornography at night,
so I'm going to do it right.

40
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,750
Jerk Golf and get a little bit of rest.
I didn't like the habit,

41
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:29,460
but it created a bad habit.
Well you, uh, you get real,

42
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:31,890
uh,
intense thinking about things.

43
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,530
Even when we're talking
about like business stuff.

44
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:38,520
Like you can tell like you get,
you focus on things, which is good.

45
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:40,280
If it's a good thing,
you know,

46
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,730
but sometimes that kind of thinking
can get away from you. Yeah.

47
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,450
I think it does sometimes for now the
same kind of focus that can get you really

48
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:52,860
excited about something that's productive
in your life can also get you obsessed

49
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:57,270
with something that's not productive.
So Sec, the kind of person that you are.

50
00:02:57,271 --> 00:03:02,260
And a lot of performers. You're an
impulsive, creative person. Impulsive,

51
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:05,170
creative. People sometimes
get cotton ruts, you know,

52
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:09,610
and there's a bunch of different
reasons I think for for addictions.

53
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,520
I think their psychological
addictions is physical addictions.

54
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,880
Some of them are undeniable, like physical
addictions. Some of them will kill you.

55
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,080
Like you get off of alcohol
too quick, you'll die. Yeah.

56
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,000
It's a physical addiction that is real.
I can't point.

57
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,760
You can't pretend it's not real.
That shit will kill you. Right.

58
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:25,810
So it's obviously real.

59
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,390
But then there's other ones like
washing your hands too many times,

60
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,360
like some people are addicted to
washing their hands. I know I do it.

61
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:33,880
It doesn't go anywhere without
Purell everywhere. Washing his hands,

62
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,060
he's putting Praill. It's crazy. She's
hand is linked to touch door knobs,

63
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:41,180
put touches, door Knob, Purell back to
the hands. It's weird. And you, you,

64
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:44,590
you fuck up your skin flora,
like it's not good. Yeah.

65
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:47,050
We had a dude that used to
lick both of his shoulders for,

66
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:50,080
he'd start talking to me. Oh, that's
good. That's good. It's crazy.

67
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:54,940
That's a let motherfuckers know you're
serious. Oh yeah. That's an Irish.

68
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:59,440
Hello. Right. Well, we'll
wait. Where were in crazy town?

69
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:02,780
You're the mayor.
Lucky doing you lick your shoulders a tea.

70
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:03,761
We had to do it in our town.

71
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:06,670
He put like a chocolate on your shoulder
and you try to get it off the heat.

72
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:10,090
It all. That's not right.
That guy's is going to grab
you one damn. Fuck you. Well,

73
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:12,940
he did get in trouble for
something. I don't remember
what it was. I, I'd grown up,

74
00:04:12,941 --> 00:04:16,630
but he was, he's like one of those
angler fish. He's tricking you. Yeah.

75
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,830
He's getting you to look at that.
Huh?

76
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,570
It's going to get you come
looking for that chocolate. God,

77
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,820
he did off my shoulder, my
shoulder. Boom. He looked down.

78
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:29,430
He's got a bat in his hands. Well, if
you said it's like you on that play,

79
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,410
get your chocolate. Come get
you shot. Just chocolate.
