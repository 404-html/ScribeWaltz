1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,600
The joe rogan experience, you know,
I dunno what we're speaking of,

2
00:00:04,601 --> 00:00:07,720
but we need to talk about Kanye just,
oh,

3
00:00:07,721 --> 00:00:12,550
Jamie's got crazy Kanye conspiracy
theories. Slash. Theories.

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,560
Well, first, so first of all, he's
like, he came out for Trump recently,

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,510
sort of,
he wore a make America great again hat on,

6
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:27,610
but he also called Trump a bald thief.
Why suddenly too?

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,190
He did. Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah, he
called them balled crook or a Paul.

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,020
Kanye is a lunatic.
Yeah.

9
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,650
So I could care less what he
says about Amy loves saying,

10
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,320
Jamie Sleeps with a picture of Kanye.

11
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:45,490
I'll stop if you believe that
she came to believe that.

12
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,930
Come on people believe everything you
were saying about me. It's not a, it's I,

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,260
it's a pendant with a picture
with his picture on in it. Jamie.

14
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,460
A big fan of two things.
Nuclear Weapons and Trump. He's,

15
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,530
yeah, he loves nuclear bombs and
he loves physics class. Yeah.

16
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,940
So Trump before, here's, here's
what, here's what I like.

17
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,340
I, well, Connie is a lunatic,

18
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:17,110
but I do like Candace Owens who was also
new on the scene and my Fox News world.

19
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,670
You love that. I love you love
conservatives and Candace is just like,

20
00:01:21,671 --> 00:01:26,470
she walked in from work the other day
and I was like started listening to Fox

21
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,830
News is on and of course I'm watching.
I'm like, who the hell is this?

22
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,020
You Say Fox News is on of course,

23
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,650
because Fox News just blaring propaganda
through your house all the time.

24
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,440
Do you ever switch it up?
Like have like CNN on the back,

25
00:01:38,441 --> 00:01:42,730
nine Fox News on in the living
room. I watch it. I do watch CNN.

26
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,780
Alex Jones says 200 1:30 PM to watch
him for wars. Exclusive on Kenya's.

27
00:01:46,781 --> 00:01:50,320
Candice and Kanye like exclusive.
I don't, it didn't happen.

28
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,610
It's like alive. What is he going
to say? Featuring canvas and Kanye.

29
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,450
So I need a lump them in together.
But he's he talking about them.

30
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,930
Everyone thought they were
going to be on this show to you.

31
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:05,050
Oh, it didn't happen for a wars
exclusive. He probably called them Kanye.

32
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:09,820
It's Alex Jones. I could
care less that Connie says. I
like what canvas says. Well,

33
00:02:09,821 --> 00:02:14,821
Jamie thinks that all this wackiness
with Candace Owens and Kanye is really

34
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:18,490
Kanye just getting people hyped up
about the release of his new album,

35
00:02:18,491 --> 00:02:21,400
which will be out in a few months.
So he's getting people fired up.

36
00:02:21,401 --> 00:02:22,720
You think that's what's happening Jamie?

37
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,640
Yeah, there's a internet
conspiracy that's been like,

38
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:28,970
not proven because it can't be proven yet,
but uh,

39
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,030
there's a long Twitter thread and a few
like reports now blogs or magazines if

40
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:33,331
you will,

41
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:37,650
that sort of lead to like an Andy Kaufman
s type performance art piece that he's

42
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:37,980
doing.

43
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,450
Maybe bring up a conversation about some
of these topics he's actually talking

44
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:45,480
about. Or maybe we'll find
out when his album comes out.

45
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,140
If Kanye is doing performance art,
then what's the point? Here's the,

46
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,600
here's the problem is a certain amount
of him that is undeniably insane.

47
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,760
And um,
you've seen that,

48
00:02:56,761 --> 00:03:00,310
like that thing that Jimmy Kimmel
mocked where you had that little kid,

49
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:05,380
he used to do little kids saying things
that Kanye said and like he would have

50
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:10,210
like, really? Yeah. Like he
would have little kids say
exactly by the way, hate him.

51
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,020
He's a nice guy. No, you meant to be
like him. I want to go. I, he's like,

52
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:15,670
why he cries about hunting.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,070
Okay.
