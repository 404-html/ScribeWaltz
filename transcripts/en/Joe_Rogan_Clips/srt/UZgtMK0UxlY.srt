1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:04,250
The joe rogan experience,
right. Dude, I tell you,

2
00:00:04,251 --> 00:00:07,640
I support all the trans rights
and everyone doing all this stuff.

3
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:11,990
The only thing that I ever go like that
doesn't seem right is with athletics.

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:12,740
Oh yeah.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,380
That's the only thing where I feel like
it's not that I don't feel like someone

6
00:00:15,381 --> 00:00:17,660
should be able to play
any sport and compete,

7
00:00:17,661 --> 00:00:22,661
but like when a dude at transitions
to becoming a woman and I was like,

8
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:28,130
I play basketball now. It's like, come
on, man. Yeah. Like I get it. You're,

9
00:00:28,131 --> 00:00:30,350
you, you have the right to
live your life and play.

10
00:00:30,351 --> 00:00:35,351
But like you have all those skills that
you developed as a man and now you're

11
00:00:37,101 --> 00:00:41,090
playing against frailer,
smaller, you know,

12
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,900
like that to say that like
you can't bring that up.

13
00:00:44,901 --> 00:00:47,830
That that's offensive is ridiculous to me.
Well,

14
00:00:47,831 --> 00:00:51,010
especially when it comes to fighting.
Fuck yeah, man. That was the big one.

15
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:56,370
And that was where I really understood
like how bizarre and defenses for that,

16
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,210
how cult like this,
this ideology is.

17
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:06,340
I'd like to see you transition to a
woman and fight women fun fucking to have

18
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:11,470
what, 12 murder charges. That would be the
fun part. It doesn't make any sense. No,

19
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:12,304
of course not.

20
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,550
The bone structure is so different and
people that deny that are fucking crazy.

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,320
I know. That's that. That is
silly man. What if, what if
I like transition, whatever.

22
00:01:20,321 --> 00:01:23,610
Anyone a man and does a powerlifting,
well,

23
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,720
people have done that and they're winning
and breaking all these records they

24
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,210
are and why are we like,

25
00:01:28,211 --> 00:01:32,050
why are we not stop and being like that
doesn't know that it doesn't cause we

26
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:34,510
want to save people's feeling.
Exactly and silly.

27
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:39,540
What's really fascinating is in the
process of being super progressive,

28
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:46,890
you you go towards the most
maligned part section of society,

29
00:01:47,621 --> 00:01:52,621
which is like transgender people and
so everybody else who also has been

30
00:01:53,081 --> 00:01:57,830
marginalized by society, like
women, women get put on a d,

31
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:02,740
they get put in a less protected
category then transgender women,

32
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:08,100
so a man becomes a more
protected class of woman.

33
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:13,030
Yeah. Then natural born woman herself.
That's very interesting. That's crazy.

34
00:02:13,031 --> 00:02:15,310
That is. It's very true. Also, yeah,

35
00:02:15,311 --> 00:02:19,930
it's crazy because all these women that
got beaten up by that man who became a

36
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,610
woman,
started fighting in MMA,

37
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,760
fought two women before ever disclosing
the fact that she used to be a man

38
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,880
because she said it was a medical
issue that had nothing to do with them,

39
00:02:30,881 --> 00:02:35,880
which is just shows you how completely
insane the logic behind all this.

40
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:39,790
She's still fight this. She
hasn't in a while, but uh,

41
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,850
now everybody knows she lost
to a woman who she did. Yeah.

42
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:47,510
An actual woman who wound up, uh,
yeah. I said actual fuck off. Yeah.

43
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,990
People were like,
but that's,

44
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:56,440
why wouldn't you say, but that's
wild, right? That a woman beat.

45
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,030
She's not good. No, she's not good. She's
not a good fighter. No, she's just strong.

46
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,210
Yeah. Like there's nothing you, you
don't look at her and think like, oh,

47
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:08,230
she fights like Chris Cyborg or she
boxes like Claressa shields. No,

48
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:13,180
she's not that unbelievably talented.
She just physically way different.

49
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,800
Yeah. She's a fucking man. Some
man for 30 years had children.

50
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,020
This was when,
when I knew it was crazy.

51
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:24,130
I got in a conversation with someone
and online with this woman was like,

52
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:25,390
she's always been a man.
I go,

53
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:30,630
even when she got another woman pregnant
and had children with her and she goes,

54
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:33,190
yes. Even then she was a
woman. She was a woman.

55
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,820
She was a woman that fucked another
woman and got her pregnant. Okay.

56
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,480
Why just hang up. What? Yeah,
what are we doing? I know,

57
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,440
like this is so crazy. You've got
to tap out of those conversations.

58
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,410
And Bruce Jenner,

59
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,330
when he transitioned to Caitlyn Jenner
and then eventually got his, his surgery,

60
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,980
right. Or her surgery become, she
said even before the surgery though,

61
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:57,670
it didn't change anything. I
was always 100% a woman. Okay.

62
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,330
Then why get surgery?
Well,

63
00:04:00,331 --> 00:04:04,810
it because you thinking that
gender is just with Genitalia,

64
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,770
that'd be a mistake. You
personally, what is it?

65
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,960
It's gender is not just genitals.
It's in your mind. Right.

66
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:18,460
So, so it's also, it's facial
reconstruction. Fucking stupid.

67
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,720
And I just let you know how dumb that was.
So what is the difference?

68
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,950
Someone said that, uh, there's
gender and then there's,

69
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,040
there's biological sex and that gender
is the operating system and biological

70
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:34,990
sex is the hardware.
I hundred percent agree.

71
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,083
It makes sense.

72
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,370
Outrage over transgender female
weightlifter who destroyed your rivals by

73
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:49,030
hoisting 19 kilograms
more than the runner up.

74
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,860
Now she's a contender for the Commonwealth
Games. Yeah. Yeah. Guess what?

75
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,650
Oh my God. Look at the size of her.
Fuck Laurel's it got damn gorilla.

76
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,640
So major international weightlifting
debut in Melbourne's about fun.

77
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:07,720
See the hounds more than the second place.
Yeah.

78
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,130
What in the fucking Holy Hell. Oh
my God. And look at the size of her.

79
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,083
Fuck.

80
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,390
Can you imagine if you're a biological
woman who's been training and working

81
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:20,740
hard all her life?
Yeah.

82
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,020
And then all of a sudden you have to
compete with this and you're like,

83
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:26,770
I'm first place like, and she's giant.
Like look at the size of her head.

84
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:29,950
Her formerly male head.
Yeah. That's a giant woman.

85
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,330
That's just the way to get metals.
Well, it's sandbagging. Yeah.

86
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,610
That's what a lot of it is. That's fucked
up, man. That is, that's what it is.

87
00:05:36,611 --> 00:05:40,810
What a lot of it is, people don't
want to admit they're sandbagging.

88
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,321
If you don't know.

89
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:44,800
What it means is like you would get
that in martial arts tournaments,

90
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:48,050
like say you would have a tournament
and the tournament would be um,

91
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,610
like for blue belts only,
which was like one rank above white belt.

92
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,900
And then guys would be like a black belt
in judo and they would enter into the

93
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:59,110
blue belt division and dump everybody.
Right.

94
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,390
And so like I don't have a belt in that.
Right? Yeah. But he's sandbag and like,

95
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:05,270
you know what they're doing. Yeah. And
everybody knows what they're doing.

96
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,000
You see that shit and you,
you see there's,

97
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,930
there's a lot of that where people just
want to win and the way they can win is

98
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:13,910
by competing against people that
are not in their same level.

99
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,320
If you don't think that people do that
when they switch over from being a man

100
00:06:18,321 --> 00:06:22,160
for 30 years and then competing as a
woman and not tell them and just start

101
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:24,260
smashing these women.
So obvious,

102
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,290
there's something in that that
you don't understand. Athletics,

103
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,880
you don't understand competition.

104
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,330
You don't understand sandbaggers and
you don't understand the kind of people

105
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:35,420
that wouldn't tell people about
that in the first place. Sure, yeah,

106
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,110
but they don't want to look
at it that way. They want to,

107
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,690
everything has to go through
the filter of being progressive,

108
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,960
so you have to err on the side
of being the most open minded,

109
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:52,580
the most liberal and the most progressive,
which I'm honored percent for.

110
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:57,710
If women want to fight a transgender
woman, if a woman wants to,

111
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:02,660
I think you should be able to ride bulls.
I think you should be able to skydive.

112
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,570
I think you should be able
to do fucking bungee jumping.

113
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:08,510
I think you should do a lot. You should
be able to do a lot of ridiculous,

114
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:12,530
crazy dangerous shit. You should
be able to do flips with BMX bikes.

115
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,800
Why shouldn't you be able to fight a man?
Yeah.

116
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,060
Why shouldn't you be able to
fight a transgender woman?

117
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,390
A woman who used to be a man. You
should be able to. If you're a man,

118
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,300
you're up for it. Yeah. If you're
a woman rather than you're 130 lbs.

119
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:28,070
You want to fight 130 pound
hundred percent, man. No,
no transgender, no nothing.

120
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:30,950
If you want to do that, you should
be out to, you should be allowed to.

121
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,830
I don't advise it.
I think it's a terrible idea for you.

122
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,420
You're going to get pummeled. Well,
if it's a good fighter, there's just,

123
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,170
what is this? What's going
on here? Bodybuilder. We
just tell him he Jens power,

124
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,270
the thing that the article says,

125
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,320
this person can't decide to compete as
a man or a woman and this is what they

126
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:51,500
look like. They can't decide whether
to compete as a man or a woman.

127
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,530
That's what he used to look like
on the left. Yeah. Fucking hey man.

128
00:07:54,531 --> 00:07:55,430
Then oh my God,

129
00:07:55,431 --> 00:08:00,431
it was super jacked and now
he is on the right and the Z,

130
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,520
but he looks like he's still
a man, says he hasn't, uh,

131
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,580
Trans Chan transitioned yet
still lives his life. Both.

132
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,270
He lives his life as both saying,

133
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:15,320
this is where you're seeing that there's
some of these fucking people that have

134
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:16,130
mental illness,

135
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:21,130
but there was an episode of radio lab
where this one guy who's also a girl,

136
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,070
um, switches back and
forth and under pressure.

137
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:29,840
He changes like he's Paul or rescinded
and this is what on what radio lab's

138
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,880
podcast and radio lab is so fucking left
wing and I love them. They're amazing,

139
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:39,770
but there's so left wing
and so progressive that they
are unwilling to note and,

140
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:44,720
and even even address the
proposed generous nature of
this fucking person who's

141
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:48,080
like, I just switched now. I'm Cindy
right now. Now I'm back to Paul.

142
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,920
Went back to Paul in the conversation
in the conversation like I just turned

143
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:53,630
over like, Oh, you did? Oh,

144
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:56,580
you're this special creature that
can just go back and forth and,

145
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,300
and switch genders or are you fucking
crazy? Paul Slash Cindy. Yeah.

146
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,950
We would never have violated
pages wishes in the story.

147
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,530
It's an unfortunate understanding.
What did what he did, he pulled up

148
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,630
there note and when they had to
change the whole story member,

149
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,890
they had to go back because they got mad
that they mis-gendered them and their

150
00:09:14,891 --> 00:09:15,520
original

151
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,090
podcast, how they miss gender
if she goes back and forth.

152
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,350
They had to keep up at the moment.
So,

153
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,730
so they mis-gendered how
were they called her?

154
00:09:27,731 --> 00:09:31,270
A him or him or her.
Which one's the mis-gendering

155
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:35,690
a miscommunication was between the
reporter and the actual person they were

156
00:09:35,691 --> 00:09:36,460
talking to.

157
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,290
Yeah,
the person's fucking crazy.

158
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:42,310
You can't just go back and forth and
back and forth like cut the shit.

159
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,370
You know this,
this whole thing is just preposterous.

160
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,270
It'll remove references to the
name she no longer recognizes.

161
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:53,110
Does that mean that afterwards,
afterwards she decided to go full female?

162
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,950
That's what happened, which
is so me, Craig format.

163
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:01,530
So at one point in time during
the show she's, she switches like,

164
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:06,370
come on man, Paul now and Paul now. Now
back to Cindy. Cindy, Cindy's light.

165
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:11,260
You can Cindy's Lewis. He doesn't
care. Psychiatric help at this point.

166
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,960
At one point in time we will see that.
Here's the thing,

167
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,900
you're not allowed to say
that when it comes to gender,

168
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:21,130
when it comes to anything else, if you
like, oh, I recognize it as a wood Elf.

169
00:10:21,131 --> 00:10:25,540
I'm a Wood Elf, you know? That's how
I, that's how I identify. I'm a sprite.

170
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,860
I should be in the forest flying around
with the butterflies. Like people go, Oh,

171
00:10:29,861 --> 00:10:32,930
you probably has, how's an
issue? Okay. Schizophrenia. Yeah.

172
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,550
But if it's a guy who's built like
Brock Lesnar who's like, you know,

173
00:10:36,551 --> 00:10:41,500
I've always identified as Amanda, small
thin woman and people are like, yeah,

174
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,520
who damn cool. Yeah. You should respect
that. Yeah. We should respect that.

175
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,780
When it comes to gender.

176
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:51,990
Gender is a weird thing that we allow
all sorts of very illogical behavior.

177
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,830
Yeah. Like these 78 plus
gender step, but by the way,

178
00:10:56,831 --> 00:11:00,400
they're adding more. There's more
like they will, there weren't enough,

179
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,400
there's more gender pronouns
now than ever before.

180
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,610
Like if it's a guy at a bus stop
who was like, I am the president.

181
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,880
You don't go like, oh, we should respect
the fuck out of that right now. Right.

182
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,260
You're just like, oh my identify
as as the leader of the free world,

183
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:17,260
they should address that. No,
you're supposed to be like,
hey, stand over here. Yeah.

184
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:22,030
When it comes to gender, we're supposed
to, we give like a lot of leeway.

185
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,990
Let a lot of things slide,
get this true. Yeah,

186
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,900
and I think it's for good reason.

187
00:11:28,901 --> 00:11:32,860
I think the good part of it is that we
recognize that there are people that

188
00:11:32,861 --> 00:11:35,290
really do wish that they were a woman.

189
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:40,270
It would like you to call them a woman
and why not let let the guy become a gal

190
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,030
and then maybe they'll be
happier that way. And it shows,

191
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:47,860
I guess shows acceptance and kindness on
our part to just allow that to happen.

192
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,670
True.

193
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:53,670
But the problem with that is is the
goddamn slippery slope and lot of this

194
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,000
weirdness that's going on is people
trying to control other people's behavior.

195
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:02,560
And one of the ways they try to do that
is try to get you to use words that

196
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:07,210
they've made up. Yeah. This is where
you're seeing how preposterous it is.

197
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,570
The level, the number of
pronouns is also 78. I mean,

198
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:14,260
I until recently and somebody saying like,
I don't identify,

199
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,530
like I understand that concept.
It's not too hard to understand,

200
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:22,950
but where it's like I also have free
reign on a hundred words that you should

201
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:29,940
possibly know to address me by.
Yeah. It's like, what do you fucking,

202
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,330
why are you bothering everybody?

203
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,930
You know what it is that what you get
off on when you become special that way?

204
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,170
Yeah, of course. You get special
rights, special privileges,

205
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:43,210
special attention you get.
It's just special consideration.

206
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:48,410
And I remember, I'm trying to remember
if my, uh, yeah, on my, yeah. Yeah. I've,

207
00:12:48,411 --> 00:12:51,370
I've had on my profile on
Twitter for a long time.

208
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:55,850
Like if you read my first bio sentence,
I'm a comedian is as Comedians,

209
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,560
Zim Zer pronouns.
But nobody respects it.

210
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:05,950
Well, I didn't even know Zim. Zim is a
big one. I know it was [inaudible] z.

211
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:09,460
H. E r or z. E. R. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

212
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,150
Those are these motherfuckers.
There's just so many.

213
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,960
The fact that one of those guys could
just become a woman and just enter into

214
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:20,620
women's weightlifting competitions
and they would be like, oh,

215
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,250
she's a woman. She's
always been a woman. God,

216
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:29,200
she beat the competition by an
astounding 600 pounds. Really crazy.

217
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,790
Yeah. Beat the second runner up by
40 pounds. No big deal. It's normal.

218
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:38,800
Super Normal. It happens. Yeah.
No, everybody does it. No,

219
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,510
no. We're going to look back on these days
and it's going to, it's going to be a,

220
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,590
an astounding

221
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:51,210
sort of observation on mass mass thinking
like group think like what happens

222
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:57,230
when people are scared of
expressing themselves honestly and,

223
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:01,750
and expressing controversial points of
view because of the time and the culture.

224
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:07,030
Like what it, you know, what,
what ramifications it has.
Like, by the way, here's,

225
00:14:07,031 --> 00:14:10,360
here's what's weird. I'm, and I
don't know if it's good or bad.

226
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,100
It's not a judgment call,
but I am,

227
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:17,490
I know so many people whose
children are now transgender a lot.

228
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,590
Yeah. Like five or six.
I didn't know any before.

229
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,390
Like all those growing up haul in
California. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Well.

230
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,240
One of them in Canada, but yeah,
really important. What's this?

231
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,640
Toronto fewer ease.
Jessica Plat is this CW Hls,

232
00:14:33,641 --> 00:14:36,250
first openly transgender player.
Now.

233
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,680
She used to be a woman and now as a man,

234
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:43,510
used to be a man now as a woman and she's
playing women's hockey. Okay. Fuck that.

235
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:49,300
That's crazy. You know five people. Yeah.
Talky. Guess who's an all star this?

236
00:14:49,301 --> 00:14:53,330
Yeah. Jessica. Yeah. Take, take that
fucking mountain from the game of Thrones.

237
00:14:53,331 --> 00:14:54,810
Put them in skirt.
See?

238
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:58,690
See how many people he plows over like
God damn human bowling ball. Oh my God,

239
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:04,900
that dude. It's so fucking crazy. It's
just if you're going to play sports,

240
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,440
there should be. Look there. There
are physical freaks that are women.

241
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,490
There's no doubt about that.

242
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,760
There's some women that are just physical
freaks and there's some women that

243
00:15:13,761 --> 00:15:15,470
also take steroids.
That's,

244
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,470
that's another very controversial
issue because you have women that are

245
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:23,830
ingesting large amounts of male hormones
and changing their physiology and then

246
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:28,850
they also compete against women,
but then there's women or just women.

247
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,430
What about them?
How about looking out for them?

248
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:36,080
How about not letting them get their head
smashed in by Matt Fairman times down

249
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:38,990
to, it's not fair, but
it's also, it's it just,

250
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:44,470
it just shows you how silly people have
gotten and about how weird we are about

251
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:49,940
looking at things and that everyone is so,
and it because they don't have,

252
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,890
they don't really have a
personal stake in the game.

253
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:57,110
Everyone is so concerned about being
viewed as being incredibly progressive and

254
00:15:57,111 --> 00:15:59,590
open minded that they don't
want to criticize those.

255
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:03,770
It's really interesting point because
if you really put yourself in a

256
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:06,740
competition you care about say
like it's important to you to win.

257
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:11,790
Imagine yourself competing in something
where it's important to you to win and

258
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:12,980
they go,

259
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,010
but then we're going to have this person
in and those are the circumstances you

260
00:16:16,011 --> 00:16:20,210
would, you'd be the first one. It'd
be like, fuck that. That is not fair.

261
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:24,500
And those women get taught called bigots.
Yeah, it gets, it's really strange. Yeah.

262
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:27,350
That is very strong.
As women get like attacked online.

263
00:16:27,351 --> 00:16:30,830
Like there's a bunch of women that didn't
want to fight that transgender man who

264
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:35,270
became a woman in MMA and they got called
bigots and transphobia and that and

265
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:38,000
the transgender people,
that community,

266
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:41,330
and he's like super aggressive about
defending that intellectual turf,

267
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,130
defending that idea.
See,

268
00:16:43,131 --> 00:16:47,390
that's an interesting place is like where
where you go because you have to have

269
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,260
empathy for let's say this transgender
person who was like, I want to compete,

270
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,070
and you're like, yeah, you should
be able to compete. But how has,

271
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:59,990
how has the circumstance fair to both
sides, you know, to those women that,

272
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,440
that are rails upon attention.
Part of,

273
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:07,340
part of the wanting to compete is also
wanting attention and wanting everyone to

274
00:17:07,341 --> 00:17:11,840
know that you're a man or transition
to a woman and that there's, look,

275
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:14,150
there's a lot of energy in that.

276
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,720
There's a lot of people that are
paying attention to that and,

277
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,520
and anybody who says no,
that's preposterous. People,

278
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:23,120
they want their privacy when it comes
to these matters and they, they're not,

279
00:17:23,121 --> 00:17:27,780
they don't want to be open to the
ridicule bullshit bullshit. They, they're,

280
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,890
they want attention a hundred
percent that's why they're competing.

281
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:31,790
It's what you're doing.

282
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,630
It's why they're letting everybody know
that the first openly transgender woman,

283
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:39,890
it's a lot of this is about, I mean
some of it is about transgender rights.

284
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:43,610
It's about transparency and showing people
how many of those folks are out there.

285
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,230
A lot of it's about horse shit. Yeah,
there's a lot of attention. A lot of it.

286
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,740
I mean for you to sign up for that
competition when you know him,

287
00:17:51,741 --> 00:17:56,741
what's what to pay attention getting
especially things like power lifting and

288
00:17:57,001 --> 00:17:57,990
MMA,
like

289
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,580
to deny that there's some sort of
a difference in the male frame.

290
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,150
There's also a lot of horse shit when it
comes to like what actually happens to

291
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:10,890
the body during transition and how much
strength you lose and how much bone mass

292
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:15,600
you lose and there's a woman
named Dr Ramona Crut sick,

293
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,540
I think that's her name and
they interviewed her and
she's one of the very few

294
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:21,780
people that's been interviewed about
this as an actual endocrinologist.

295
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,780
That's not a gender
transition doctor does.

296
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,620
That's what a lot of them are.

297
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:31,440
A lot of the people that talk
about these things and have these,

298
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,860
these discussions about these
things that are hashtag experts,

299
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,320
they're actually transitioned doctors so
they have a vested interest in sort of

300
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:46,370
expressing the ideology that there's no
physical advantage and that these women,

301
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,540
you know,
they,

302
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:52,440
once they have been under these hormonal
treatments for x amount of years,

303
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,790
they become physiologically a woman and
there's no distinction between them and

304
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,130
a biological woman.
But this one woman,

305
00:18:59,131 --> 00:19:04,020
doctor Ramona crut six she wrote a an
an article for, I want to say it was,

306
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,890
it was either SB nation are bloody elbow,
I forget what it was,

307
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:09,810
but they interviewed
her and she was saying,

308
00:19:09,811 --> 00:19:12,340
not only do you not lose
bone density but you,

309
00:19:12,341 --> 00:19:15,600
you maintain it because you're taking
estrogen. And she's like, well,

310
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:18,690
the idea is that like a man is
more bone density, they're thicker,

311
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:19,524
they're built different,

312
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:23,520
and that you would lose a lot of that
in your transition to being a woman,

313
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,870
but you don't lose the bone density
because estrogen is actually what causes

314
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:32,190
people to maintain their bone density.
When they're older, when they were women,

315
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,650
like that's one of the things that
happens to women when they get older,

316
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:37,850
they get osteoporosis.
What part of the problem is that your,

317
00:19:37,851 --> 00:19:40,470
your body doesn't produce as
much estrogen as it used to.

318
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,070
And so you have a lack of bone density.
One way to heighten that,

319
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,030
it's to supplement with estrogen.
It actually maintains bone density.

320
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,180
So it's a good argument,

321
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:54,300
but they're not the same as men because
they don't have testosterone anymore.

322
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,640
And if they're not taking
exogenous testosterone,

323
00:19:56,641 --> 00:19:58,470
they're definitely gonna have
a disadvantage against men.

324
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,710
But they still would have an advantage
against men about against women rather

325
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:05,790
than mechanical advantage of course.
But there's also a mental advantage.

326
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:10,800
There's a reaction advantage. Um,
the reaction time is quicker with,

327
00:20:10,801 --> 00:20:12,330
uh,
with men than it is with women.

328
00:20:12,331 --> 00:20:17,331
Like there's a bunch of weird three d
space recognition advantages that men

329
00:20:17,491 --> 00:20:18,324
have.
It's like,

330
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,660
and then there's the thing that
people want to pretend that there's no

331
00:20:21,661 --> 00:20:25,080
difference between men and women. There's
that group, you know about that group.

332
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:29,870
No, but that seems like so stupid to
even entertain the idea. God, that's,

333
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,020
this is a common thing among the most
ridiculous of the progressives is that

334
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:37,360
there's no biological
difference in the sexes. What,

335
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:43,380
how can anything that's so
dumb, but I, it is dumb,

336
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:48,620
but it shows you how insane
a lot of this thinking is,

337
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,020
is that this group think this mass
progressive thought process. Yeah.

338
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,690
That they just accept things that,

339
00:20:55,691 --> 00:20:59,170
that are totally irrational and
they repeat them as ad nauseum.

340
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,030
Like we played this
one clip where there's,

341
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,480
it seems like it's a transgender man
to a woman to man who's saying she was

342
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:08,280
talking,

343
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,770
there was a Jordan Peterson debate and
she was saying there's no biological

344
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:15,460
difference between the sax. I'd be happy
to unpack that for you. Oh, really? Like,

345
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:19,060
Oh, you'd be to unpack.
Yeah. Biology. Sure.

346
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:23,680
And just no difference at all in
our biology is no, it's not real.

347
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,590
Okay. There's no biological
basis. And in sex and Jen, what?

348
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:33,460
Right. What did I say is this is
an extra big it. Yes. I'm sorry.

349
00:21:33,461 --> 00:21:36,940
You transphobic. Are you a big it?
Is this an, this is an expert? No,

350
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,760
but she's teaching at a college.
Oh, that's yeah, that would fall,

351
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:41,380
but that's what a lot of
go, well, that's going on.

352
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,720
There's a lot of that going on in
colleges where people are teaching

353
00:21:43,721 --> 00:21:47,560
unbelievably ridiculous shit. I got
pace. Yup. Go for it. Go for it.

354
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,170
[inaudible].
