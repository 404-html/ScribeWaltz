1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,490
You mentioned the thing with feet and
I was watching blue planet to the other

2
00:00:03,491 --> 00:00:05,380
day and there was,
it's not a fish apparently,

3
00:00:05,381 --> 00:00:07,480
it's called like a toad of some kind,
but it's,

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,800
it hangs out on the bottom
and it has feet. It's,

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,290
it looks like a fish that grew feet. It
walks around. Yeah. That's not a fish.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,520
I don't believe so. It's actually a some
sort of toad I think technically. Whoa.

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:23,010
But yeah, and they look like human feet
almost like how his toes and everything.

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,430
Well, one of the weirdest things that I
ever saw about the ocean was there was a

9
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:31,080
theory that was going around a few
years ago that I don't know if this is

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,160
legitimate,
not go Google,

11
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:37,161
that they think that it's entirely
possible that octopus Octopi may have come

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,600
from eggs that were frozen and
landed here from an asteroid.

13
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:45,680
There was speculation that there
was something about the way, yeah,

14
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,510
the way that they pro,
you know,

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,520
the DNA and RNA of octopus are so
different than every other animal in the

16
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:57,050
fossil record that it's almost that there,

17
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,360
there was a consideration that they
might have actually been an alien species

18
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,330
because you know the term,
you know what Panspermia means.

19
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:08,520
Panspermia is a theory that is pretty
widely accepted in the scientific

20
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:13,380
community that some life is transferred
through asteroid collisions.

21
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,810
So like that,

22
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,820
say if a chunk of rock slams into our
planet and knocks a chunk of rock loose in

23
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:25,281
that chunk has DNA on it and the amino
acids and all the building blocks for

24
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:30,060
life, that bacteria, whatever it is,
things that, some things, you know,

25
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,830
little things can survive in space like
tardigrades little life forms can to

26
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:38,850
survive in space that they slam into a
planet eventually and then when they do

27
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,260
that, that life is transferred onto that
new planets. Science News. Holy Shit.

28
00:01:43,261 --> 00:01:47,400
The buses came to earth from space as
frozen eggs millions of years ago. Okay.

29
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:49,730
But this is like the, the express. Yep.

30
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,030
I was trying to, I read it
a little bit, but that's,

31
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,340
that's the most feasible version
of aliens coming here. Yes.

32
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,540
We tend to think of it as it lands and
they're like a spaceman who looks like

33
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:03,290
George Clooney steps out but he has
like antenna or something like, hi, I'm,

34
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,740
I'm here to share with our,
our planet all,

35
00:02:05,741 --> 00:02:09,220
all tuna or whatever and he speaks
English and all this shit. Like it's,

36
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:13,340
it's on a, on a biological level
that we almost can't comprehend.

37
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,040
You could go back to that James,
please

38
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,200
look what it says that the extraordinary
claims made an a report entitled the

39
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:22,200
case of Cambrian Explosion,
terrestrial or cosmic,

40
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,540
which caused by a group of 33
scientists and published in the pro uh,

41
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,810
progress in biophysics and
molecular biology journal.

42
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:37,260
And the paper suggest that the explanation
for the sudden flourishing of life

43
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:38,270
during the Cambrian era,

44
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,280
often referred to as the Cambrian
explosion lies in the stars as a result of

45
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,500
earth being bombarded by
clouds of organic molecule.

46
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:55,250
Wow. I think that's also the theory of
how water got on earth. They came from,

47
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,830
it came from comments,
cause when you see comments,

48
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:02,170
comments are all water and I think like
millions of years of us can hammered by

49
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:05,200
comments. Huh? Like you know when
you see the trails of comments,

50
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:10,030
that's literally ice, dirt and
debris coming off of that comment.

51
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,880
I didn't know that.
Literally the more you know,

52
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,750
the more you know it in a comment,
but it,

53
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,910
they think that about mushrooms as well.

54
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,270
They think that spores
can survive in a vacuum.

55
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:27,271
So if something like say if some
spores were attached to a rover yeah.

56
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:32,620
And we shot her off to move to the moon
or something like that and it got there

57
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:35,800
somehow or another, if there was the
right conditions for that thing to grow,

58
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:40,801
that they could actually survive the
trip and then grow on the moon or on Mars

59
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,020
or anywhere where would be water
and sunlight and atmosphere,

60
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,860
like invasion of the body snatchers.
Yeah. We'll spores or even weirder. Right.

61
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:52,090
Because spores create mushrooms and
mushrooms actually breathe oxygen and you

62
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:54,690
breathe out carbon dioxide.
They say they're,

63
00:03:54,691 --> 00:03:58,740
they're closer to an animal than the art
of vegetables. Yeah. That's uh, that's,

64
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,670
I've thought about that when I've, when
I've eaten magic mushrooms a lot. Right.

65
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,630
It's like I basically just ate an animal.
Well, you also feel like it's taking,

66
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,250
like it's alive inside of you
communicating with you. Right.

67
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,590
Don't you feel like that? Like it's
not as simple as I'm getting high. No,

68
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,310
I smoke weed. I feel like I'm
getting high when I eat mushrooms.

69
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:23,210
I feel like I'm entering into the thought
process of an alien creature. Yeah. You,

70
00:04:23,211 --> 00:04:27,340
you put on like a space suit on the
inside in a way and, and you're,

71
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:31,690
you're evolving a certain way if only for
like seven or eight hours or something.

72
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:32,680
Yeah.

73
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,330
Do you ever microdose now I have friends
that do that and Ron White's big into

74
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:38,720
that. Oh, is he? Every day

75
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:44,020
you'll have found [inaudible] but
good kind of medicine. Oh my God. Ron.

76
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,340
Ron White kills me, man. I just,

77
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,270
you just pick their most random name
you could have, but I'm just like,

78
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:50,560
that makes perfect sense.
