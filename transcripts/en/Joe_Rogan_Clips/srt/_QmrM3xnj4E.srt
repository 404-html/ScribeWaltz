1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,940
I obviously have been, you
know, I've, I've been very, uh,

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,100
didn't mention all trite
violence all that often,

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,520
but then you have to realize the alternate
is tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny. They're,

4
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:11,550
they're rare. They've admitted defeat.
You know, Richard Spencer said,

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,830
I think he said this at the
Antifa one or something.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,710
No one showed up and he hit an
event in Florida. 11 people shut up.

7
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:17,670
I'm not worried about that guy.

8
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,760
I'm worried about these fringe
ideologies that are racist,

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,050
intolerant and violent. The slowly
seeping into our culture. Like

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,550
when you see politicians openly embrace
like race based government policy,

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,090
it's war. It really does
worry me. You know, my,

12
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,860
I think I have this perspective growing
up in a mixed race family where I've

13
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:44,340
been insulted by the left for being
white and I've been insulted by far right

14
00:00:44,341 --> 00:00:47,880
racists for being, you know, a month.
And so I don't like either of it.

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,773
I really don't.

16
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,070
But the white supremacists types are
falling apart and they don't threaten me

17
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:57,310
anymore. They, they just don't.
But the left wing racism and,

18
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,080
and these ideas of racial equity and
determining what your worth based on the

19
00:01:01,081 --> 00:01:03,060
color of your skin are becoming
more and more pervasive.

20
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,230
The lawsuit with Harvard that,
that Asians have a harder standard,

21
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,590
a tougher standard for getting in even
though agents or a smaller minority than

22
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:12,420
white people.
Why does that make sense?

23
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,260
Why should I have to approach
someone and justify my race to them?

24
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:19,620
That terrifies me. It really does. And
we, when we see Kirsten Gillibrand tweet,

25
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:23,840
the future is intersectional. We'll
intersectionality is that ideology of,

26
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,630
of race based policy. Okay.
Kazia Kurt has put forth, puts,

27
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,430
puts forth the green new deal
that says racial equity. I,

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,900
I prefer to judge someone on
the content of their character,

29
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:35,790
not the color of their skin.
While it's also,

30
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:39,960
that's the kind of talk that gets Trump
reelected. Oh God. And that's that one.

31
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,330
That's one of my biggest
pet peeves because you know,

32
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:43,680
I've talked about progressive tax.

33
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,610
I think we can do a lot for a public
option for expanding medicaid. Uh, the,

34
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,870
the idea of a green new deal at
its core to me is fascinating. Can,

35
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:52,980
can the government,
you know,

36
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:57,180
can we allocate tax money to invest
in new technologies, fusion, uh,

37
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,760
nuclear and reduce carbon
emissions and do great things?

38
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,670
Can we make high speed rails?
But then when you come out and say,

39
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:06,480
pay the unwilling and these other equity
things and intersectionality, I'm like,

40
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,210
that's, that's not, that's not what I'm
talking about. I can't support that.

41
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,580
The unwilling is the
most preposterous one.

42
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,670
The idea that someone's unwilling to
work and we need to provide them with a

43
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:18,390
living. That's insanity. I mean,
that's the ultimate progressive bend.

44
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,190
But in that's where it keeps going.

45
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:22,770
But where they're trying to out
progressive the next concept, but it,

46
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:26,210
but hold on in a socialist or
communist society stuff to work. Yeah.

47
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,540
I don't know what society exists where
you expect people to undertake the

48
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:33,180
greatest construction project
in the history of humanity.

49
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,240
A massive train network that
makes all planes obsolete,

50
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:38,310
but at the same time tell people they
don't have to work if they want money.

51
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,560
Well, this is what
we're saying. It's like,

52
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,630
as these ideologies get
more and more ridiculous,

53
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,450
they try to out progressive the next step.

54
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:51,620
Like it's a fundamental right
for you to earn a living. And,

55
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,140
and Pew Pew research recently put out
a poll last week, couple weeks ago,

56
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,740
Democrat, the Democratic Party, 54%
want more moderate policies. So I'm,

57
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:01,270
I fall in that bracket,
but still,

58
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:04,570
you still have about 43 or so that
want more left leaning policies. Oh,

59
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:07,480
that means the party split. And so
here, here's the problem. I see.

60
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,540
If you're going to put me up, if
you're gonna say, Tim, you got to vote.

61
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,400
You have to vote.
You have to make a choice.

62
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,820
You've got a moderate conservative who
believes things I really don't agree with,

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,790
but he doesn't want to give money to
people who don't work and he doesn't

64
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,580
believe in identitarian politics
and race equity or whatever.

65
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,190
And then you've got the Democrats
who are so far left to me,

66
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:27,330
I can't even see them anymore.
Who Do you think, you know, uh,

67
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,900
social liberals and liberals are gonna
vote for the closest person to them

68
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:36,160
politically will be a conservative. You
know, that's what scares me. You know,

69
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:39,580
we had this great future with a potential
for a public option for expanding

70
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:43,960
medicaid for, I mean, look, I, I really
do believe social programs are important.

71
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,540
We can do more.
I like a lot of what Bernie has to say.

72
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,170
I think we need to reform education,
but I think education could be expanded.

73
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,750
Again, I'm interested in, the idea
is I want to advocate for them,

74
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:56,650
but we need to figure out how to do it.
But my po, like where I fit politically,

75
00:03:56,651 --> 00:04:00,430
I'm politically homeless. I don't agree
with someone judging me based on my race.

76
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,740
I've been through that.
Hell No. Never again.

77
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,740
People vandalizing my home because they
didn't like that at a brown mom and a

78
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:07,330
white dad,
I don't want to live in that world.

79
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,540
I don't want you to look me in the eyes
and say, I tell people, look at this way.

80
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,380
When it comes to Harvard,

81
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,400
I want you to look into the eyes of
that little Asian boy and say, honey,

82
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,600
you can't go to Harvard. You're Asian.
You look too much like those people.

83
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,710
How does that make sense?

84
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,640
Why is it that just because this
kid looks similar to this kid,

85
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,800
you're going to tell him he
has a harder standard for pat,

86
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:29,770
for the sats to get into the
school. I just, I, I refuse.
