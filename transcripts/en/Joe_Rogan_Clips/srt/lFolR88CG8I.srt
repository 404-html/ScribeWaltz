1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,870
Those are the operation paperclip.
You can call it paper clip. He Shit,

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:06,830
our government brought those. He, you
think he would always say to us? Yeah,

3
00:00:06,831 --> 00:00:11,400
but that's the, I think there was several
waves. There was like 34,000 of them.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,120
Yeah. There was a lot of fucking Nazi
scientists brought over on Youtube.

5
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:17,340
It says a operation paperclip was,
uh,

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,920
anywhere from like 1200 to 1500 psi.

7
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:26,450
The total number of admitted congressional
hearings in the 1970s operation

8
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,740
paperclip, Frank Church Committee in the
70s released it and leave the numbers.

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,380
34,000, 207 look it up. There's a lot.

10
00:00:34,381 --> 00:00:38,010
I told you they give people simple as
you pulled it up, but it is fascinating.

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,970
They brought those people over
here and that's where the,

12
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,980
the space program came from. Came
from the shirt. Not as a sick joke.

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,180
They already had the
CIA. That was LSS. Okay.

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,370
The CIA's Oss. That's all on record. Okay.

15
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:57,360
I'm glad you question me. No, but I don't
know what that means. What is oss again?

16
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,980
Uh, office of special plans are
off. That was before the CIA.

17
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,940
And then the closet for
teaching, so to like, um,

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,820
the office of strategic services.
Like what was before the seals,

19
00:01:08,821 --> 00:01:13,821
what Jesse Ventura was the frogs even
terocin in that he was an auxiliary of the

20
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:17,520
navy. He was never in combat.
Anyways, let me expand on that.

21
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,050
The LSST,

22
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,450
the office of what is the
sheet wandering refills?

23
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,960
The Oh, ash ash was British intelligence
are the most powerful British,

24
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,670
the most powerful
intelligence agency ever.

25
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,980
They set up proud house at 22 after
World War II to anglicised that U s we'd

26
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:37,460
British intelligence, not a British
geologist takeover a marriage.

27
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,190
It was just all this, just like on
PBS. Okay. This just stuff that's true.

28
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,730
They'd met say they only academics are
watching it, so they'll tell the truth.

29
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,510
The general pop culture is all crap meant
to be dumbed down into turn you off.

30
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,370
But when you go to the
real academic stuff,

31
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,230
I mean the old days of
frontline and stuff,

32
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,630
like I watched that to know if it's
true. Later got the documents, it's all,

33
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:56,820
it's all real. That's like, those
shows were like really accurate.

34
00:01:56,821 --> 00:01:59,360
Like Bobby Kennedy plan to blow
up the embassy and on nurture.

35
00:01:59,361 --> 00:02:03,970
So like what was I getting
too? I don't Nazis Nazis. Well,

36
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,720
Wernher von Braun.
Really Weird.

37
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:12,080
Isn't it weird that the one man who
directed all six moon missions was a Nazi

38
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,520
and he was brought in that
one? Isn't that crazy? One guy,

39
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,030
he didn't smoke weed and one guy is having
a problem with memory. Two guys did.

40
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,840
And why you want to Defend Warner?
That's fine.

41
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,050
35 Nazis and I've seen
doctors rant about it.

42
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,970
He sketched for Hitler.

43
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,380
This plan to drop atomic bombs
that they hadn't developed yet.

44
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:36,090
So when you see red skull marvel comic,

45
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,090
they've got a big bomber to love New York.
It wasn't a bomber,

46
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:43,710
it was a space plane and it was about half
the size, but it looks just like this.

47
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,100
And the Germans actually
some of their scientists,

48
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,720
what's the Russians or the Russians
tried to build their special,

49
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:54,150
it was half the size. That was
actually the German plan show show.

50
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,260
You look it up.
I'm not kidding.

51
00:02:55,261 --> 00:02:57,370
Because the Russians took a lot
of Germans as well. Correct.

52
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,380
About a third of them. Yeah, so look,

53
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,100
the reason I'm wearing this just
explained this is a gateway to all of it.

54
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,490
So you have British intelligence
did one world war one,

55
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,070
Germany had way more advanced technology.

56
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,520
They then take over British intelligence
basically merges with the u s and then

57
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:18,460
the Germans and others say,
we've got to go way ahead in technology.

58
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,020
There was all theoretical and labs,

59
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:23,470
but they could mass deploy it that you
didn't have enough machine shops and

60
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:24,400
systems to build it.

61
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,140
And US special forces went on suicide
missions and blew up the underground

62
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,760
mountain. How about the Nazis were
the first to build flying saucer,

63
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,140
all of it. But let me
tell you, that's crazy.

64
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:41,350
British cars,
British intelligence flying saucers,

65
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,600
the CIA,
the CIA and 47

66
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,740
so now the Nazis are over
here and they go, listen,

67
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:52,690
you don't want them running everything.
And they go to Eisenhower and they say,

68
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:58,260
we want to launch a off based breakaway
civilization where you compartmentalize

69
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:03,400
things, forget empires, and you'd have a
new ruling class of technological elites.

70
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:07,540
And then the elites are all in charge of
the public's watching TV and we'll give

71
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,460
him widgets and foundation
series type things at the verb.

72
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,500
This is all in the documents and
let them try to run an empire.

73
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:19,180
We'll build a whole new empire. And so
Eisenhower gives a speech, worry about,

74
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,610
he doesn't just say military
initial accomplished,

75
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,070
he says the technological elite lots,
the full 21 minute speech,

76
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:28,840
his farewell address and 62 he says,
or six 61 he says,

77
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:33,250
you need to watch out about
the scientist because,

78
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,970
because he said no to the NASA
plan when he found out what it was.

79
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:42,100
But is it's a breakaway civilization where
you don't try to run the whole planet,

80
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,640
you siphon off resources and
build a whole new advanced system,

81
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,120
and then you play her body off against
each other and collapse it. So when I say,

82
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,860
what is an Assa if we could take NASA
back over, it's bigger than the CIA.

83
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,760
It's the real government, the space
ships and the stuff that's all PR.
