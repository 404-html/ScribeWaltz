1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,060
Is, is drumming a young
man's game? I mean,

2
00:00:03,061 --> 00:00:06,450
is it like athletics where as
you get older, drummer slow down?

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:08,960
I don't know.
I haven't,

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,640
I played just as wild as I did
back in the day and I will do,

5
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:15,780
you know 43 you look great. Oh
thank you. Don't look 43. Yeah.

6
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:17,490
Max Weinberg told me one time he was,

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,300
he watched me play and he was like at
a show or blink played and he's like,

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,070
I don't know how much longer
you can play like that.

9
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,420
Cause it was like real hard dude. He's
like, you're going to need back surgery.

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,130
You play like you have rabies smashing
the fucking drums. So knock on wood,

11
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:36,510
nothing has changed. And I've just, I
play exactly how I always have, you know,

12
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,170
um, I don't even want to think about a
day where I have to play any different.

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,210
Sure. It'll come. But do you get massages?
Yes. That'll help slot, right? Yeah.

14
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,810
Massages, Epson Salt, Bass. Um,

15
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,380
that's where the tank comes in
play. Man. That thing looks amazing.

16
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,920
The tank is all Epsom salts. Look at
you, dude. You don't fucking crazy

17
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,960
when you watch that. I watch
you play. And I would just go,

18
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:04,320
how the fuck and this
guy maintain this pace?

19
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,360
Cause everybody drums differently.
You know? I mean it's,

20
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:10,710
it's really interesting to watch
people's different, especially, uh,

21
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,400
my friend bill burr really got into
drumming and uh, you know, he's,

22
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:17,120
he's really into it and I like
watching them play and it's,

23
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:20,310
it's interesting to see someone take
something up and get better and take

24
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:21,300
lessons and learn it.

25
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:26,301
But the thing that really strikes me
is how many repetitions are involved.

26
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,560
Like as you're doing this,
like the,

27
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:32,610
the amount of times you're hitting
these drums is fucking insanity.

28
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,500
You gotta pace yourself. If it's
a two hour set, I know like, oh,

29
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:41,860
this is a verse of this song. I can kind
of, this is not a big, big part. You know,

30
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,180
you can kind of chill, but it's like a
round, you know, if you're doing around,

31
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,390
look up in the clock and you realize,
Oh wow, I still have two minutes left,

32
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,210
we'll pace yourself.
And you know what I mean?

33
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,160
That's kind of how I approached shows.
But,

34
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,630
but the goal is to train so much before
you even get on tour that you're not

35
00:01:57,631 --> 00:01:58,860
even having to think about that.

36
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,560
You're just playing the show exactly
how you want to play. It's almost,

37
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,940
I imagine it's like that with fighting
where you envision what you want to do in

38
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:10,560
your head and you're in the shape and
you know the technique to execute.

39
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,320
You don't have to think about our goal,
like, oh, I can't do that. I'm not,

40
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,670
I didn't practice that enough.

41
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,350
I like to be able to just do whatever
I'm feeling and not, you know, be like,

42
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,880
well shit, I don't know how to do that
or I'm going to get tired if I do that.

43
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:26,940
I don't want that to happen.
You know? So that's the goal.

44
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,510
It's just being able to execute what
you have, the idea in your head. Well,

45
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:35,010
musicians have to have discipline
because you have to practice.

46
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,120
It's one of the things that makes you
guys so unique in the entertainment world.

47
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,640
It's like, I mean, I guess maybe actress
have to practice stand up comedians.

48
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:46,410
We only practice in front of an audience.

49
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,980
But you guys have to fucking practice so
you don't go on your show before you go

50
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:53,400
out. No, I write,

51
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,480
I write and I listened to
recordings of old sets,

52
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,090
but I don't like to sit in front of
a mirror and go, hey folks. Yeah,

53
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,463
I don't do that.

54
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,340
I don't know anybody because it feels
so weird when you go up to do what it

55
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,440
would feel were Hearst, right? Yeah.
That's the last thing you want.

56
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,080
You gotta be in the moment.
Same thing happens with it.

57
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,410
If you practice too much as a band and
then you go try to play those songs and

58
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,750
act like you're having fun,
that happens.

59
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,460
So I try to practice a lot on my own
and I'm not even practicing those songs.

60
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:24,700
Just kind of just drill, you know? Yeah.

61
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,920
But Sam Kinison used to have a joke
about the beach boys about a, they're,

62
00:03:28,921 --> 00:03:30,640
they're going out there playing,

63
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,840
I wish they could all be California girls
again and like Jesus fucking Christ.

64
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,010
Like it becomes a job that you don't want,

65
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:42,490
that you want it to be fresh and exciting
and you want it to be something that

66
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:44,110
you're really in the moment
and really thinking about.

67
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,060
So I make up new shit on the spot too.

68
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:51,061
That's the best is I just make up new
fails or just try to reinvent the songs to

69
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:53,800
the point where even like Marco
look back at me and be like, wow,

70
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,710
you're going to do whatever.
Like that's the best, you know,

71
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,840
just kind of freaking it on the fry
and even to the crowd it's like Whoa,

72
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,120
that's cool.
You haven't heard it like that before.

73
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,230
So that's like after two or three months
of being on tour you do stuff like that.

74
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,380
Yeah.
When you get off tour,

75
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:15,940
do you consciously give yourself arrest?
No,

76
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,930
I'm busier at home than I am on tour
on tour. So lavish man like you have,

77
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,630
you have someone saying,
I mean,

78
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:27,460
you do have people kind of waiting on
you hand and foot somewhat, you know,

79
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:31,330
like a catering, you know,
ready if you want to eat or hey,

80
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:35,170
you got to go do an interview 30
minutes before you go onstage. Uh,

81
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,870
cars outside waiting for you after
the show, taking you to the hotel.

82
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,410
So that doesn't happen
at home and at home.

83
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,770
I do so many other things besides
play in the band. Like I, you know,

84
00:04:44,771 --> 00:04:49,510
produce a bunch of rap artists. Um, I have
crossroads, I have clothing companies,

85
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:54,390
I have three kids. It's way
busier at home. Tours, tours,

86
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,270
a vacation. That's
interesting. Yeah, for me. Wow.

87
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,360
Cause I don't know how to say no either.
My Joe,

88
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,670
I have a lot of things I love that I love
doing, so I can't complain and be like,

89
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,760
Oh, I hate going to the steer. I
hate doing this. I love it all.

90
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,100
I just kind of love it all so much that
I have trouble saying no. Sometimes.
