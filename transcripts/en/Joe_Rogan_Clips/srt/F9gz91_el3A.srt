1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,610
Is, it's almost like
communities, you know,

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,000
is is you have your, your, your thoughts.

3
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:09,360
I've got my thoughts and we're part
of two separate communities. Right.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,400
And it's just like with anything else,
he,

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:16,430
I think that integration between the two
and that balance is like the most key

6
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:20,610
to everybody really. It kind of will
grow everybody, you know, the, the,

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,780
the bounty hunters can learn something
from the Vegan is just much the vegans

8
00:00:24,781 --> 00:00:27,300
can learn from the bounty hunters, you
know what I'm saying? I think so too.

9
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:27,601
You know,

10
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:31,380
and I think that really the problem is
when people don't want to hear the other

11
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:33,250
side and they want to shout people down,
they don't,

12
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:34,530
they're not willing to listen.
And there's,

13
00:00:34,531 --> 00:00:38,270
there's common ground across
the board and some of it,

14
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:42,000
it probably is just learned,
I think a lot about like how you grew up.

15
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,230
And I think it's important to
like understand that, like I said,

16
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:48,720
just to go back to my childhood,
it is just,

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,000
that's the way I grew up and
that's what I understood.

18
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:54,480
But when I look at like
my dad, you know, like my,

19
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,140
my dad didn't have his dad so,

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,650
and he was out the house by 15 you know,

21
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,700
he and I try and put myself
there sometimes being a 15
year old kid that didn't

22
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:08,970
have a place to go.
Like what are you going to do?

23
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,020
And the only people you see around you is,
is drug dealers and in and on us.

24
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,600
So like a lot of it I give credit to
him for sticking around for me because I

25
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:23,430
would have no people over top of the
head, you know? You know what I mean?

26
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,760
And that's why people do it because
those people that are doing that are just

27
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:28,870
like you and me.
Everybody's like you said,

28
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,390
we're all just human beings and
we very genetically and we vary,

29
00:01:32,391 --> 00:01:36,170
but we very more buyer environment, how
much love we get. Yeah, yeah. That's it.

30
00:01:36,171 --> 00:01:40,170
That's a big part of it is like
it's just the culture is, it's just,

31
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:41,400
you know,

32
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,400
and I think it stems from one culture
being separated from others and not having

33
00:01:48,091 --> 00:01:52,080
that integration. Then you get that
like even more of a disconnect.

34
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,100
And then once you get the
even bigger than, you know,
it's, it's all like downhill,

35
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,630
more insecurity, which leads
to more tribalism and it's,
the whole thing is just,

36
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,300
it's so disappointing that
people still operate like this.

37
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:06,570
But I think people were opening
up to that more now than before.

38
00:02:06,571 --> 00:02:09,240
I just think it's a slow process.
Slowly but surely,

39
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,050
slowly but surely we still working at it.
You know,

40
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,120
we were talking before about the
Rosa parks picture out there.

41
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,850
That wasn't that long ago, man. No,
no, no. It really wasn't. And, and,

42
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:22,410
and that'd be the thing with certain,

43
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,650
there's certain white people too
that just be like, all right,

44
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:28,380
just get over it already. And
it's like, come on, like it,

45
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,300
they didn't have to get over it. Exactly.
It is, they experience it then you don't,

46
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:36,120
you truly don't understand.
Uh,

47
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,540
and you don't even like take the time
to try and understand their tribal to,

48
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:44,690
they'd talked to other people that say
the same shit and like, yeah. Well,

49
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,480
and they'll just start rattling off the
statistics about the instances of crime

50
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:51,750
in the black community and how the
agents don't do this, but the blacks do.

51
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:54,540
It's like it's fucking cultural.
If you don't think it's cultural,

52
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,940
you haven't been enough around enough
people and it does not go back.

53
00:02:56,941 --> 00:03:00,160
A lot of generations, like you said, the
course is not very long ago. You know,

54
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:01,420
my dad didn't have his dad,

55
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:05,410
he didn't have that person to teach him
what not to do and what to do. You know,

56
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:08,680
it's, it's, that's a, that's a, that's
a hard road, especially for a young,

57
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,600
like you go back earlier, like young
guys get delusional real quick, you know,

58
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,410
they feel invincible. He felt like, oh,

59
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:16,270
I can do this and I'm
never going to get caught.

60
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,670
You don't have that voice of reason
to tell you right from wrong when you,

61
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,400
when you that kind of age and it's
because he didn't have his dad.

62
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:26,920
And then while I didn't have his
dad because he didn't have his dad,

63
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,620
you know what I mean? That only
goes back two or three generations.

64
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,410
Crazy. As you're talking about
1865 is when slavery was abolished.

65
00:03:34,411 --> 00:03:38,520
So we're talking about a small amount
of time in human history where there

66
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:41,060
haven't been slaved.
So all your isolation when you,

67
00:03:41,061 --> 00:03:45,120
you felt as a kid where you felt separate
from the people that were in the miles

68
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:48,180
that were higher than yours.
Think about that.

69
00:03:48,181 --> 00:03:53,000
Times a hundred is if you were a
slave and maybe a million remedial

70
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:58,540
insurmountable gap between a slave that
has no chance of ever not being a slave.

71
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,550
And someone who can go to school wherever
they want and travel abroad and do

72
00:04:02,551 --> 00:04:03,390
whatever the fuck they want.

73
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:08,010
And then the idea that some of these white
people think that these people should

74
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:11,730
just get over it with the amount
of time is so fucking short.

75
00:04:11,731 --> 00:04:14,930
You're talking about we just had
black panther, the lifestyle,

76
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,870
we just had it beat Avatar.
It's beating.

77
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:24,050
Yeah. I mean one of the number one
biggest movies of all time. Stupid big.

78
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,050
That should help,
believe it or not,

79
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,360
I really think it would help.

80
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:32,480
It was a beautiful movie and it
was a beautiful movie to describe.

81
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:37,481
Even like when you say 1865 I feel
like we so disconnected from even that,

82
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,540
and this is,
I've talked to a lot of people about this,

83
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,350
the difference between being called a
black American and African American.

84
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:48,110
You know, I don't, I hate being
called an African American. I just,

85
00:04:48,111 --> 00:04:52,480
that's what everybody says. But we
know and it's just taped it to me. It,

86
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,420
it makes you seem, because you put
me in Francis' next to each other,

87
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,470
Frances and an African American, you
know what I mean? He's, he's from Africa.

88
00:05:00,471 --> 00:05:05,330
He has ties to African. Who else is
in African-american? Elon Musk. Yeah.

89
00:05:05,331 --> 00:05:07,970
I mean, yeah, really when you are ill,

90
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,960
but I think even more now it Kinda like,

91
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,000
I just, why can't we be, the black
comes in so many different shades,

92
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,760
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

93
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,620
And as this African obviously,
yeah.

94
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,840
So maybe black Americans a
better way to put it. Yeah.

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,760
But Africans have ties to Africa, you know
what I'm saying? Like black Americans,

96
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,930
slavery, like we feel, I feel we
should have our ties in America.

97
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:32,170
Like I should be proud to just be
an American, not be called that

98
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,860
African American we call it, you
know. Well it's with every generation.

99
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,270
It's going to take a long time before we
just abandon all this nonsense and just

100
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:42,970
treat people based on who
they are as a human being.

101
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:46,930
But my grandparents came from Italy
and they were treated like dog shit.

102
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,800
And my grandfather always talked about
the racism that he encountered when he

103
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:52,750
came over from Italy to America.

104
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:55,840
And they didn't think of
Italians as white people.

105
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,930
Now they think of Italians
is white people. 100% yeah.

106
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,160
And the Mexicans are experiencing that.
Like, you know, if you're from Spain,

107
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,330
you're basically white.

108
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,710
Like nobody thinks of a guy
from Spain as being like,

109
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,800
you don't think of in the same way
you think of Mexicans, right? Yeah.

110
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,330
But one day all that shit will go away.
One day we'll get past this,

111
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:19,970
whether it's who knows how
many generations it will take.

112
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:23,080
But I think it's changing now because
of the Internet. I think there's, yeah,

113
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:23,540
there's,

114
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,960
there's definitely like more hate
groups that the consolidate and they get

115
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:30,800
together and they, they, they, you know,
they, they live in an echo chamber online.

116
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:33,050
They talk, you know, and
they agree with each other.

117
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,960
You see it on Twitter and
Twitter's trying to stop that.

118
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:38,630
And maybe that's misguided
because maybe it strengthens it,

119
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:42,020
but I think that ultimately is the
ability to exchange information.

120
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:45,890
Is it going to allow more and more
people to compare notes and, and,

121
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,950
and understand that there's no,

122
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,220
there's no benefit to describe or to,
to,

123
00:06:52,221 --> 00:06:56,000
to thinking of people as being inferior
or superior or better or worse.

124
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:59,690
We're just all different, but we're
all human. We're all just humans

125
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,370
of all the same. I mean, really, you
see that when you, when you see people,

126
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,370
you know, you can really see
somebody that you really know him.

127
00:07:06,371 --> 00:07:10,510
You really see him. He's like, yeah,
it is. We literally all the same,

128
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,030
but all different too, because that's one
of the beautiful things is that you do,

129
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:18,030
you see these little different
aspects of individual's personalities,

130
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,510
but to lump people in a group, Oh,
you know, you're a Chinese guy. Oh,

131
00:07:21,511 --> 00:07:23,640
I know what the fuck you
are. You're this. Oh,

132
00:07:23,641 --> 00:07:26,250
you're an African guy on know what
the fuck you are. You're this. No,

133
00:07:26,251 --> 00:07:27,084
that's nonsense.

134
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,690
There's a broad spectrum in each and
every classification, but at the,

135
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,770
at the end of the day, we're all the
same thing because we're all just people.

136
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,140
Yeah. Waa. Waa. Waa. Hundred
percent. I mean, yeah,

137
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,670
it's just when you talk about
heaven, like pride in, in,

138
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,790
in it,
I feel like helps a little bit more of a,

139
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,760
if I identify with like as a black
American, you know, instead of,

140
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,820
instead of like an African American,
it's just, see what you're saying.

141
00:07:50,821 --> 00:07:54,060
You know what I mean? I feel like
it's a little more, you know,

142
00:07:54,061 --> 00:07:56,380
I just looked different, you know
what I mean? Like I bought my,

143
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:01,100
I'm more integrated and it would
give me more pride to beat it. Right.

144
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,960
You know what I'm saying?
And, and I think that steel,

145
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,150
you were obviously all the same in,

146
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:09,420
in there needs to be integration but
you still have to have some type of

147
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,780
identity. You know what I'm saying? I
know what you're saying. Yeah. I mean,

148
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,410
and I think that the movie in itself
did a good job. Uh, I don't know.

149
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,270
I just went back to black pot,
Black Panther.

150
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,120
I think it did a great job in
describing like the differences,

151
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,190
there are differences between the black
community at in the African and African

152
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,960
Community, you know what I mean?
Or African Africa itself in,

153
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,980
in it because you get that,

154
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:36,000
you get that like anger,
you know what I mean?

155
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,650
Like that's like the stereotype is
like the bite angry black man. Right.

156
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:45,890
But some of it stems from not no one
where you're from and not having that core

157
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,060
identity.
Right.

158
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,410
And I feel like we can just do that
again here in America as black America is

159
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,490
instead of Idaho.

160
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:56,520
Yeah.
I hope what represents is a,

161
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,810
it's a meter to register that
racism is dying. Yeah. And that,

162
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,810
that this is,
this is also people in,

163
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:08,010
there's a lot of like why people that
were going way out of their way to go see

164
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:10,620
it because they wanted to show
everybody that they're not racist.

165
00:09:10,621 --> 00:09:13,940
But I think that's good
too. Yeah. Ultimately it's,

166
00:09:13,941 --> 00:09:18,941
it's showing that this is something that
people recognize as a stupid problem

167
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:20,250
and we should get past it.

168
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,900
It took God damn long
enough. I mean, what,

169
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,770
we're probably going to be telling this
to our grandchildren and they're still

170
00:09:27,771 --> 00:09:30,320
going to be experiencing some of it and
then there's going to be something new

171
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:33,170
comes out and you're like, God, daily,
we just now doing this. Like, you know,

172
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,750
that's the way it going to be. Uh, but
for me personally, you know, he's just,

173
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,800
because everybody, every kid wants
to be a sober here. I'm like, oh,

174
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,240
how are you doing? You know? So
it's just like a whole lot of them.

175
00:09:44,241 --> 00:09:47,720
You can be half of the empire and be
blade. Yeah. A, yeah. I mean, yeah,

176
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,730
but blade was like a hit man.
You know what I mean?

177
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,040
It goes back to what you see
around me. If I only see the, the,

178
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,200
the drug dealers and the,
you know, in every, you know,

179
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,990
there was never a black superhero and it
was like, all right, well shit. All right,

180
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,970
we didn't go up there, Huh? Yeah. And it
portrayed us as scientists or, you know,

181
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,140
it was loud. I just, yeah,

182
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,080
white get over it guys. That doesn't
register for you. Cause they're all white.

183
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:15,020
Every fucking superhero. Batman, spider
man. Even the Hawk is white. Okay.

184
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,930
First. Yeah. And I mean, and I, and
I, I get it from a lot of it. I mean,

185
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,100
there's just, it's just
culture. You know what I mean?

186
00:10:22,101 --> 00:10:26,210
And it's is not better or worse than
one thing or another. You know, there,

187
00:10:26,211 --> 00:10:28,460
there's Hawaiian culture,
there's, there's, you know,

188
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,340
it's just culture and it just,
that needs to be celebrated too,

189
00:10:34,341 --> 00:10:37,100
because the more you celebrate culture,
the more you can integrate between

190
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,580
all of them. Right. And then
there's the real problem with,

191
00:10:39,581 --> 00:10:41,780
I don't want those cultures
to go away. Yeah. You know,

192
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,110
I was in Chinatown in Boston this weekend.

193
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:47,170
We went and ate dinner at two o'clock
in the morning is Chinese restaurant.

194
00:10:47,171 --> 00:10:51,310
It's China town, right? Jamie,
that place was China town.

195
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,150
They got like fucking, uh, Alaskan
king crabs in a fish tank. Like,

196
00:10:55,151 --> 00:10:57,820
how the fuck did you even get that here?
It's still alive.

197
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,630
All these fish on top of each other and
they pull the fish out of the tank and

198
00:11:01,631 --> 00:11:06,100
cook it up for you. I mean, it's like
they barely speak English. I mean,

199
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:10,930
this is their culture and I want that to
still exist too. You know what I mean?

200
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,490
I just want them to be accepted

201
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,290
100%. I mean, and, and
that's the beauty about it.

202
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,270
Not think you need to keep that alive.
You know,

203
00:11:17,271 --> 00:11:19,850
there's two different spectrums
to it. There's the, there's the,

204
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,020
the person that's just like, oh,
just go ahead and get over it. Right.

205
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,040
And there is a person that just like,
okay, what you don't even have, like,

206
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,870
they don't want even like,
uh,

207
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,730
like I did it or acknowledge your culture,
you know what I mean?

208
00:11:31,731 --> 00:11:34,820
They just want to like just
shun it or just not, you know,

209
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,200
just put it into a closet somewhere
and you know that that's almost the,

210
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,520
it's the opposite. But it's just
as bad as needs to be though.

211
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,410
A buddy of mine who lives on
the big island about that,

212
00:11:45,411 --> 00:11:48,770
he's a white guy and he lives in Hawaii
and he grew up in Hawaii and I said,

213
00:11:48,771 --> 00:11:51,770
did you experience a lot of racism
against white people? He's like, no,

214
00:11:51,771 --> 00:11:55,690
cause I'm not a fucking asshole. And I
said, that's what it is, right? He's like,

215
00:11:55,691 --> 00:11:59,230
yeah man. He goes, you can't be a white
guy coming over here trying to push your,

216
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:03,130
uh, you know, mainland culture is like,
this is the fucking culture dude. He goes,

217
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:05,620
if you just accept the culture
the way it is out here, he goes,

218
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:08,800
they're not racist. Let's see if you can
get a good, you're gonna run into a few,

219
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,080
but for the most part

220
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,820
you're going to run into a few everywhere
you go. Because people were like,

221
00:12:12,821 --> 00:12:15,970
you got to go back to it. Like people
are fucking idiots in every walks of it.

222
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,780
But for the most part is always
you're not as though you good. Right.

223
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,350
It's the same way across the board
and I've kind of realized that as I'm,

224
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,380
as I'm getting older, because
before I just thought, you know,

225
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,770
we just what we are. Right.
You know what I mean?

226
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,950
I've got family members that
only will ever see Detroit.

227
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,930
They will only ever see those same blocks.

228
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:39,780
They will only ever see the same people
and that's just what you think it is and

229
00:12:39,781 --> 00:12:42,070
it's just like, oh, it's so
much now there's so much,

230
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:46,210
how much more and it's not that
different that you think is different.

231
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,310
It's, it's different. But you know what
I'm saying? It's not, it's not alien,

232
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,540
it's just, it's just, it's different.
It's just different. It's not better,

233
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,180
not worse.

234
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,270
One of the things that I really enjoyed
about traveling so much with the UFC.

235
00:12:58,271 --> 00:13:01,180
As you got to see all these different
cultures and you got to see all these

236
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:04,630
different styles of life that
these people live in and you know,

237
00:13:04,631 --> 00:13:07,630
you kind of like put it all together
and you, you, it just gives you,

238
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,620
I think this is one of the best things
about traveling is that it gives you this

239
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,730
more rounded perspective.
Like if you lived in Italy,

240
00:13:15,731 --> 00:13:18,940
you'd be like one of these people, if this
is how they live, they live like this.

241
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,540
You know, if you lived in Dublin,
you'd be like this, this is,

242
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,860
this is their style of living.

243
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:24,570
Yeah.
And it's,

244
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:28,220
and it's important to acknowledge I
think all those different styles until,

245
00:13:28,221 --> 00:13:31,590
you know, and, uh, of
living. Uh, and, and, and,

246
00:13:31,591 --> 00:13:35,510
and I think if you really want to like
cure racism in American, all that,

247
00:13:35,511 --> 00:13:39,890
and it's just being open about it
and just talking and, you know,

248
00:13:39,891 --> 00:13:43,160
people understand that other
people's upbringing is,

249
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:46,490
and what they went through and what they
do because that makes you understand it

250
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:47,540
more if you try.

251
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:51,290
And just shun it away or just say if you
even bring up the word black or white

252
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,750
or anything like people get,
you know, you kind of see it.

253
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:57,040
Sometimes people get tense
and it's just like just, just,

254
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,780
just be honest about it and
just be open about it and,

255
00:13:59,781 --> 00:14:03,220
and that will make it go away.
It's not, it's not, you know,

256
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,910
shun it and it'll go away.

257
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,920
Don't want to be uncomfortable. They don't
want to talk about uncomfortable shit.

258
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:11,280
So if something comes up that's a, well,
you know, as a black man you're like, oh,

259
00:14:11,281 --> 00:14:16,110
here we go. Here we go. I didn't
do it. Okay. I never had a slave.

260
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,440
Okay. You know, and you're
like, oh, all right man.

261
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,180
You just super uncomfortable
with being uncovered.

262
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,210
Yeah. It's like a, what for you?

263
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,580
I think that makes you that more of
the ass hole there, you know, talking

264
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,230
to a human being. If you really want
to have a conversation with them,

265
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,450
you want to know their actual
experience. Yeah. You know?

266
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:35,140
And if their experience is as a Puerto
Rican that came from Puerto Rico,

267
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:35,750
that feels disc,

268
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,220
a lot of Puerto Ricans feel
super disconnected with
the United States because

269
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:43,780
they're not really United States citizens,
but they are, it's like a weird thing.

270
00:14:43,781 --> 00:14:46,450
It's kind of like, it's not
really a state, but it's,

271
00:14:46,451 --> 00:14:48,640
it's sorta protected by the United States.

272
00:14:48,641 --> 00:14:52,040
And so they're disconnected and there's
like on the east coast growing up with

273
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,850
Puerto Ricans, there's a weird, they have
a weird alienation, you know, and that's,

274
00:14:55,851 --> 00:14:59,480
uh, if you don't want to talk to them and
you don't want to hear about that from

275
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,320
them,
that's fine,

276
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,800
but you're just gonna miss out on
that part of what life is for them.

277
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,510
You're never going to get it.
Yeah.

278
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:08,690
And all the things that they bring to it
and you know, the food that they bring,

279
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,940
the onto different arts,
you know what I mean?

280
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,880
The different styles of fighting that
they bring, the different dances.

281
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:17,960
Like everything is about
the culture you're going to
miss if you trying to just,

282
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,120
you know,
shy away from it.

283
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,440
It's martial arts is a perfect example
of like all these different cultures

284
00:15:24,441 --> 00:15:27,800
coming together, and there's
one boiling pot, you know?

285
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,090
I mean, yeah, that's one of the most
beautiful things about it. It's just,

286
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,840
I can go over to Ireland and
fight or rush at in Ireland,

287
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,200
and it's different than going down
to Brazil then fight the Brazilian,

288
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,740
you know, or something
like that. It's just sure.

289
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:46,660
But it's at the core of it just still is
fighting. It's just different styles of,

290
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,740
of being able to do it.
But everybody does it.
