1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,490
It's like when you try to
get people to do things,

2
00:00:02,491 --> 00:00:04,110
they're less likely to do those things.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,990
As soon as you are angry at
them that they're not doing it,

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,050
they're going to go the other way. People
don't like being told what to do. Well,

5
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:13,500
it's just like if somebody wants
to get sober, right. Right.

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:20,040
If you, if they are ready. I work in
jails. It's one of my part time jobs.

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,450
So what are you doing? Jails. I
do substance abuse stuff in jails.

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,370
So if you, um, if they're ready,

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,560
everything you say you're like a guru.
If they're not ready,

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,900
it doesn't matter what you say. Right. So
I do groups in jail. I teach meditation.

11
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:43,620
I also teach a goal setting.
I've been doing it about six years.

12
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:47,450
I've been in the field of
substance abuse for awhile. And um,

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,600
it's very rewarding. It's not, you
know, you don't make any money,

14
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:54,980
but it balances the life. Yeah. You know,

15
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:59,520
I don't want to sit around all day. Most
comedians, that's what they have to do.

16
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,780
You know, they work at night, right?
So, yeah, I work at Plymouth jail.

17
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,850
How often you do it. Uh, two or
three days a week. Yeah, that's good.

18
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:11,640
So it's not,
not every day now.

19
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:16,500
And I take the summers off
too because it's intense.
Yeah. I mean, I've had groups,

20
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,110
you know, I had one guy,
he came in and you do it.

21
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:27,090
You'd do divide people, ethnically
white guy, but six, six, big fucking,

22
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,710
you know,
it did state time.

23
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:33,711
It was all jacked and he's wired and uh,

24
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,100
he started complaining about the
place and uh, I said, hey, this isn't,

25
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,340
I teach them to breathe, you know, like
that Guy Haas you had on your show.

26
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,630
But I teach them a different method.
It's just you breathe in for, you,

27
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:48,330
hold it for you, let it out.
It's just a calming breath.

28
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:55,210
So anyway, this guy, I said,
hey, it's places in a hotel.
He stands up. He says, yeah,

29
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:59,100
I'll take it. I know it's not how
I said, let's do up breathing.

30
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:04,890
Relax. But a lot of guys, they can't see,

31
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,820
they can't see themselves.
They can't see contradictions.

32
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,150
I, one guy, he was in, it was
a Muslim, right? So I said,

33
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,720
so you guys pray like five times a day.

34
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:22,290
How do you know when to pray
and listen to this Joe? He says,

35
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,610
the guys said, well, if I'm
doing a heist in the afternoon,

36
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,530
you know I'm gonna miss that prayer.

37
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,340
You don't see any
contract that can amazing.

38
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,051
The Guy,

39
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:37,980
the big giant guy that was angry or did
he have a certain amount of time before

40
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:41,790
he got out? What was he in
it for? Life? No, no, he was,

41
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:46,770
he was on his way out. He
was coming close. That's when
guys get the most anxious.

42
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,800
How long have you been in four.
He was in for about 17 years.

43
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,770
It's a very polite society.
Really?

44
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,450
Prison society is very polite
because every little thing,

45
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,560
just picture your,

46
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:02,600
you're trapped with all these other
guys and a lot of mental health shit,

47
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,180
a lot of stuff. But every little
thing has picked up on and reacted to,

48
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:07,991
you know,

49
00:03:07,991 --> 00:03:12,370
it's like that scene and heat between
Dinero Pachino where they just reacting to

50
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:16,060
each other. So you said, can
you please pass the salt?

51
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,900
Pass it because at any minute,
that's what I tried to teach us.

52
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,420
It's about impulse control at any minute.
And anything can happen. You know,

53
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:29,200
you're dealing with a bunch
of very impulsive people
that also have a very short

54
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:33,580
fuse there. There used to violence.
Why is one way of acting out?

55
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,400
So what I say to them is,
I have the same thing,

56
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:40,330
but it's not through violence for me,
it's like texting or something, you know,

57
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,670
I react or I drank, you know, so
it's, it's about stepping back.

58
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:49,250
Dang Gum. Yeah. It's hard when you
get tripped up with you, but the,

59
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:52,870
the mind listens to the breath.
That's the key.

60
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,970
Rather than going up in your mind,

61
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:00,940
take that breath and you know,
like when something's happening,

62
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,710
like a car crash or something.
First impulses, hold your breath.

63
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,940
Don't hold your breath, let
your breath out. I mean, a
lot of traditions have this,

64
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:14,230
you know, Tai Chee
prawning um, in, in Yoga.

65
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,090
So yeah, breathing is critical.
It's everything. When Wim
Hoff teaches it, you know,

66
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:21,400
if you follow those methods,
you can,

67
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:24,940
you can really change your
physiological state. You can,

68
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:28,750
you can get out of a lot of things.
It can get you through a lot of things.

69
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,620
You know the thing that I don't buy those,
that fucking cold water.

70
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:35,860
I don't want to go onto the
Arctic like him. Holy Shit.

71
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:39,730
It's because you live in Boston.
You get God allergy to call it.

72
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:44,530
My friend Mark Grata. He's ready to go.
He's done. He's been there for too long.

73
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:45,970
I know a lot about this weekend.
