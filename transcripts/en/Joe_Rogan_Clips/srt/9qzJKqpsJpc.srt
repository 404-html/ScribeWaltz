1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,900
I understand the mindset of people
that don't want any of this to happen.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,060
I do understand it, but I do think
that they don't understand nature.

3
00:00:08,061 --> 00:00:12,290
I really don't think they understand
that this is the best death these animals

4
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:14,660
will ever experience and they're
not going to live forever.

5
00:00:14,661 --> 00:00:16,010
And the wild and the wild,

6
00:00:16,011 --> 00:00:18,200
they're going to be torn apart
by something bigger than that.

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,690
That's just how it goes 100% of the time.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,810
Or they freeze to death or they
starve to death or they're starving.

9
00:00:23,811 --> 00:00:26,660
They walked down on the road to
try to find some food in the town.

10
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:29,480
They get hit by a semi truck.
Yeah, that's true. Yeah.

11
00:00:29,481 --> 00:00:32,600
And if I have a buddy who lives in Iowa
and when you drive in his neighborhood

12
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:32,931
at night,

13
00:00:32,931 --> 00:00:36,290
you better go 35 miles an hour cause those
fuckers are just darting out in front

14
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:40,160
of this tree weapon. Right. They're
everywhere. And you know what's the,

15
00:00:40,161 --> 00:00:44,210
what's the solution? Don't
drive cars. Drive your bike
everywhere man. Well, okay,

16
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,230
good luck with that. Yeah, I get it. I
get where those people are coming from.

17
00:00:48,231 --> 00:00:50,630
They're coming from a place of,
of compassion,

18
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,840
but it becomes very culty and it
becomes very like very team oriented,

19
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,370
their team Vegan

20
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,520
and there's like words it we're
circling back where you know,

21
00:01:01,521 --> 00:01:05,420
when you're trying to have
that middle ground, that
discussion, that conversation.

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,290
Um,

23
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:11,290
there's like this pre assigned talking
points where everybody from every respect

24
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:16,970
of side mix essentially the same argument
and you're just regurgitating what

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,390
you've heard other people say,
but there's no new thought.

26
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:24,560
There's new and there's no one taking
a step to either side. Like, okay,

27
00:01:24,561 --> 00:01:26,900
do you want maybe, maybe there's
something I'm not seeing here.

28
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:30,470
Let me look at it from this perspective.
Or vice versa. Where this side,

29
00:01:30,471 --> 00:01:33,440
the hunters like, no, no, you're
stupid snow flake. You know,

30
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:37,490
go get your Starbucks Latte, you
know, with your soy milk. And,

31
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,900
but they're never looking at it
from anything new right there.

32
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,070
They're just regurgitating
their talking points.

33
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,680
Like when you said gun control
and people freaked out,

34
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:50,220
freaked out because I didn't stay to
the script and there's a script. I mean,

35
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,560
if you pull up my, any of my
social, you will see that, oh,

36
00:01:54,561 --> 00:01:58,760
you what you should've said was, or hey,
you know, shall not be infringed upon.

37
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:02,450
Yeah man, I got it. Yeah. Shall not be
infringed upon and believe it to death.

38
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,000
Have you fought for it? Have you
bled for it had been blown up for it.

39
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:07,820
You've been shot at, I have, you
know, I really believe in this shit,

40
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,360
but I didn't stay to the script and
then I get murdered by both sides.

41
00:02:14,271 --> 00:02:19,160
So then how do we, I mean, you do
a pretty good job, so teach me Joe,

42
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,620
how do you bring people in to have,

43
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,920
there's gotta be a lot of people
that disagree with you and say,

44
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:27,770
I do a terrible job that I repeat
the same things over and over again.

45
00:02:27,771 --> 00:02:32,660
And I agree with them to for for a certain
amount of the conversations like this

46
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:33,410
one.
I mean we,

47
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,950
I've had this conversation about
conservation and animals a hundred times,

48
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,710
but I think it's worth having a hundred
more because I think it's an important

49
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:42,050
that if someone has listened to this
podcast and they didn't understand how it

50
00:02:42,051 --> 00:02:46,070
all works and they didn't understand
that people who hunt and eat meat,

51
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:48,560
they're not monsters.
They're not evil people.

52
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:53,080
Just like people who eat grain aren't
monsters because you callously disregard

53
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,860
the lives of mice and rats,

54
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,250
all the things that get ground
up and combines and bunnies.

55
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:03,520
Like if you buy grain, large
scale agriculture is bad, period.

56
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:07,780
It's bad in terms of factory farming, but
it's also bad in terms of growing food.

57
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,170
If you grow a thousand acres of corn,

58
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,460
you are absolutely displacing wildlife.
And when that stuff gets harvest,

59
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,360
you see vultures fly over those fields
and there's a reason it's because there's

60
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:23,950
a bunch of dead things.
In fact, more dead lives,

61
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:29,490
more dead lives occur in a pound of
grain then occur in a pound of beef.

62
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:36,090
Because if you think that a cow is
more valuable than a bunny because it's

63
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:42,340
larger, like you've got some weird
white thing going on in your own head.

64
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,890
Okay. Can you tell me how
to balance the soul's worth?

65
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,950
Exactly.
And how would you feel about insects?

66
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:52,450
Because they are a large scale poisoning
those fucking insects and you know it,

67
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,010
everybody knows it and they're grinding
those fuckers up with earthworms and

68
00:03:57,011 --> 00:04:01,570
mice and gophers and chipmunks
and anything else that
gets stuck in those wheels.

69
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,720
That is just how large
scale agriculture works.

70
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,700
So unless you have some isolated farm
where everything's fenced in and you only

71
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:12,340
have a certain amount of acreage
and that farm feeds you will,

72
00:04:12,341 --> 00:04:16,570
you are Karma free and congratulations
to you, you figured out how to do it.

73
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,710
But most of us who buy pasta, if you
go and buy bread in the store, you're,

74
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:25,711
you're paying someone who's killed a
large amount of living things in order to

75
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:29,890
harvest that grain. That's
just a fact. It's just a fact.

76
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,840
And it's an inconvenient fact
that they like to look at, uh,

77
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,370
with blinders on because they,
you know,

78
00:04:36,371 --> 00:04:40,720
like I'm hashtag cruelty free not to that
fucking bunny rabbit that's a part of

79
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:44,440
your tofu cause this is, this is
what's really going on. I mean,

80
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:49,710
a good part of the B vitamin B that a
lot of vegans get us from ground up bugs

81
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,610
that's ground up into their grain and
ground up into their vegetables. I mean,

82
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:58,150
this is you, this is just, you
can't get away around that.

83
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,023
No,

84
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:04,400
I mean not if you are being real,
if you're not,

85
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,700
if you're being real.
Yeah.

86
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,530
Maybe that's the problem in the first
place is nobody is going to have the

87
00:05:09,531 --> 00:05:12,440
courage to come into that
middle ground and let,

88
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,160
let go of all of their
baggage and all of their

89
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:21,700
bullshit. Yeah. And just cool with
eating bugs. You should eat crickets,

90
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:25,140
get cricket meal, eat cricket,
protein. Fucking good for you. Yeah.

91
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,610
If you don't want to eat animals,
you're like,

92
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,720
I'm just not into anything that's warm.
Okay.

93
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,920
I have a friend who only eats
fish and I go, why? He goes, fish.

94
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:36,160
Don't even take care of their
babies. I was like, Ooh, good point.

95
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:39,400
That is a good point. Fuck those
fish Fisher. Yummy too. He's like,

96
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:42,160
I don't want to kill a mammal. He goes,
I don't want to eat a mammo. He's like,

97
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:45,520
mammals take care of their babies there.
The baby's milk from their, their,

98
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:47,410
you know, their utters.
I'm like, okay, I get it.

99
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:52,300
My wife has a pescatarian for awhile.
Um, that didn't, that didn't last.

100
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,320
It's just not the best source
source of nutrients. Well,

101
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:59,770
it was when she's pregnant and
the doctor's like, all right,

102
00:05:59,771 --> 00:06:02,550
so you're 90 pounds and,
uh,

103
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,910
I need you to put on like 20 more pounds
really fast and you're not going to do

104
00:06:06,911 --> 00:06:10,880
it eating halibut. Yeah. So, yeah.
