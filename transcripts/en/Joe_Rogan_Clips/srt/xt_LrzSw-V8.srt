1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,691
Yeah.
This,

2
00:00:00,691 --> 00:00:03,810
this thing that I was reading or
listening to rather this saw Sam Harris'

3
00:00:03,811 --> 00:00:08,210
podcast. Very fucking interesting. Because
they're, they're talking about the,

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,510
what we actually know about the data
and where it's coming from and how these

5
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:16,500
people are doing this and how they're
setting these things up. Yeah. That guy,

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,550
the comic that you and I talked about
again,

7
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:24,600
that clip of this Russian who is a former
KGB guy who defected to this country

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,540
explaining how it works.
One back in the eighties yeah.

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,050
Explaining exactly how it
works and what he was saying.

10
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:35,060
This is 30 something years ago.
35 years is going down exactly the way,

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,610
and Putin is occasional he
guy. Oh, Christ. Shit. Yeah.

12
00:00:38,611 --> 00:00:43,140
I mean that's this idea that Trump's
working with them as fucking silly.

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,000
Well,
I don't know about that.

14
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,460
I don't think he's working with
them to undermine democracy,

15
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:49,710
but I definitely think they've got
some business dealings. I mean,

16
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:51,750
they were offering him to Trump.
That's not illegal.

17
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:54,930
The penthouse in Trump tower and illegal,
none of that is illegal.

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,260
Don't take that for me.
Take that from Alan Dershowitz.

19
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,120
Don't smarter than both of us.
I'm not saying it's illegal,

20
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,300
but I don't think that he was
honest about that. He said,

21
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:06,360
I don't do any dealings with Russia.
I don't have any business with Russia,

22
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,260
and he definitely did. That's just
not true. Well, we'll see. We'll see.

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,980
That's what the targeted,
they're not going to get him or anything.

24
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,730
You don't think so? You think he's
going to just, well, maybe impeachment,

25
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,250
but I'd even on on what k I don't
even know what they'd get them.

26
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,980
High crimes and misdemeanors.
I don't,

27
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,910
I don't know what he's done to talk
about building a tower in Moscow is not

28
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:31,830
illegal to have business and what he,
what did he lie about specifically? Well,

29
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:35,490
there's a lot like what we could pull it
up. Let's, let's find out all the things.

30
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:37,780
What do you get a lot of?
salon.com or you can go to a bleed.

31
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,050
Million different websites.
I know. What can we do?

32
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,260
We use to establish at the the
fucking social media tilts lapse.

33
00:01:45,261 --> 00:01:49,050
So yes, social media does.
We're not talking about
pulling up social media page.

34
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:51,260
What are you pulling up? I don't know.
Actually I'm going to ask. Let me go.

35
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,730
I'm like, I'm not a
Trump scholar. I haven't,

36
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,660
I have at my disposal all the different
times that he'd lied, but it's a lot.

37
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,270
So what do you think's going to happen
to him? You think he'll impeach him?

38
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:04,590
You mean? No, he'll resign or
what? I don't know. Look, I'm not,

39
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,380
I'm not claiming to be any sort
of an expert in legal proceedings.

40
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,580
I have no idea either. That's why I
quoted Dershowitz. Yeah, I think, well,

41
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,110
doesn't Dershowitz working with Trump now?
Giuliani's Oh that's right.

42
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,560
[inaudible] I always got a
Dershowitz cause he's fucking lip.

43
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,620
Trump average 15 and accuracies ms truce
a day in 2018 almost triple the rate

44
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:29,430
from a year of hell. Okay. But hold on a
second. What's the season? Myths. Truths.

45
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:34,170
It's a European paper. But isn't
that a little odd? 15 a day?

46
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,420
Cause I don't know it was making that
claim. I don't know the exact periods.

47
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,930
Dean in accuracies.
You doubt that it's true.

48
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,350
You think that's all lie they did just
made up the fact that he lies a lot? Uh,

49
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,180
ally's about, well, first of all, it's
a definition of a lie. I don't know.

50
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:50,320
Let's see.
It says Washington Post who they hate.

51
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:56,590
Those who absolutely say the president
made 1,989 such claims in 2018 by the

52
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,560
last day of 2018 of the Washington
Post 17. That's my point.

53
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,420
But let's wait and see what it
says. I mean, they can't lie.

54
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,070
The total figures risen to 7,600. So you
think they just made up all these lives?

55
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,260
Not all of them, I'm sure. But you could,

56
00:03:11,261 --> 00:03:14,770
you could go back with Hillary and
fucking count. You could go to, uh,

57
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,330
go to Fox knows,
and then put all that,

58
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:18,790
pull up an article of how many
times Hillary was inaccurate.

59
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,420
Do you know what are, what about
Islam is? Uh, what about is, yeah,

60
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,120
when someone talks about something
and instead of refuting it with facts,

61
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:28,270
they go, yeah, well, what about Hillary?
What about bill? Bill did a two.

62
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,140
What about this? What about that? You're
going to tell him what about Islam?

63
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,100
And that's what I just committed.
It was what?

64
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,520
Cause you were saying that Hillary lied,
but we both agree. You make my point.

65
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,850
You're going into Washington pouch. That's
just Jamie pulled up the independent.

66
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:44,080
We could go. We could go anywhere, but
hold on a second. Yeah, I'm with you.

67
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,950
I think Hillary is a liar.
I think she deleted 30,000 emails.

68
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:50,940
I think it's criminal. I think that
the Clinton Foundation's a, uh,

69
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,970
a fucking fully illegal organization.
I think they've rigged the DNC.

70
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,780
I think they, they, they rigged the
primaries against Bernie. I'm with you.

71
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,010
I'm not a supporter now
I'm not saying you, I,

72
00:04:01,011 --> 00:04:05,230
but when's the last time somebody made
a statement like that and it said this

73
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:10,080
many inaccuracies when Bill Clinton
was in office. Hillary, I'm sure,

74
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,550
I'm sure there was some inaccuracies,
but first of all,

75
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:17,020
when Bill Clinton was in office, they
weren't, they count Obama's, I don't know.

76
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:18,640
But that's a, what about ism?
You know what I'm saying?

77
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:19,780
We're just talking about Trump.

78
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:22,760
You were saying that Trump doesn't
lie and they're saying the lies.

79
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:27,730
I'm not saying he doesn't.
First of all, he said what
does he lie? No. First of all,

80
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,560
you know I like to know the definition
of a lie. If he misstate something,

81
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,720
do you think he does it accidentally?

82
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,890
I'm sure sometimes when
you're talking that Mckay,

83
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,670
so if he's lies 1,900 times a day, we'll
have a blatant. Yeah, that's fucking,

84
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,290
it's Washington Post. It's
horse shit. I don't know. I do.

85
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,640
He said no,
he's a bullshitter for sure.

86
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,470
Joe, would you argue that they haven't
been trying to take him down since he came

87
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:59,440
down that fucking escalator? How
about the deep state? How about,

88
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,820
how about the fucking dossier? What? Why
isn't anybody know? What does that mean?

89
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,910
The dossier. What dossier? The fake dot.

90
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:10,540
She had Christopher Steele that they use
to get the the Fi's and explaining to

91
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,870
people what they're, what you're talking
about. They know what I'm talking about.

92
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,970
No, no, no, no, they don't.
They don't cause I don't know.

93
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,220
What do you mean the
dossier defect dash matted.

94
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,830
They said they know what he's talking
about. They had, yes, they had tea.

95
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,300
You have to know this, so you'd
being willfully ignorant. Oh,

96
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,870
I don't know the nick. I
don't know. Hey, I'm, I'm, I'm
explaining. Hold on a second.

97
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,410
I've heard these are terms
I've heard yes and stuff,

98
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,320
but you don't know the full extent he
had the oldest is what I'm talking about.

99
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:38,710
This is as big a story is anything
Trump has done. What is the story?

100
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:44,170
The Steele dossier that Hillary used,

101
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:49,180
they went to, you had to get a, a
application defies a coach and they went,

102
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:52,780
they used a dancing opposites. You're
Christopher Steele, who's a British guy,

103
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,760
had connections in Russia.

104
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,520
Remember when they said Trump was at a
hotel and watching girls pee and on each

105
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:01,940
other? Yes. That was all in the Steele
dossier. Christopher Steele is his name.

106
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,920
They use that in their application to
get a Pfizer warrant to spy on Trump

107
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,140
during his campaign. That's fact. That's
not me being a right winger. That is fact.

108
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,910
Okay, so, but the fact that that
like that, you don't know that.

109
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,790
No, I remember that now. Oh, that,
that's what I'm talking about.

110
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,700
Then you're just a story as Trump,
you know,

111
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:25,990
lying about the number of paper does
inauguration. I want to know the,

112
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,290
I want to know a live
from Trump that's a equal,

113
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,480
equal in power as like when Obama said
that you know a lot about healthcare,

114
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:38,300
that you could keep your health care and
all that. Give me an example of Trump.

115
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:43,350
Would that big of a lie? Well listen,
I've told you I'm not, it's a lie.

116
00:06:43,351 --> 00:06:46,260
I'm not saying it's US president slide.
All politicians lie.

117
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,290
So you're just saying they stopped
to count it when Trump took over,

118
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:53,880
they started keeping, you know, keeping
statistics. Like what? Give me an example.

119
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:57,570
Like look, we just showed you all
the numbers of the Washington Post.

120
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:01,680
So if I give you another example, you're
going to say, oh, that's [inaudible].

121
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,550
If you go to salon, little salon.com
all right, welcome. Go to ou.

122
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,180
I don't know what you've gotten more
done than any other administration. Okay,

123
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:14,190
this is a lie. So true, blah, blah,
blah. See, now if somebody says, well,

124
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,290
let's see what it says. Jamie, go
back to it. What are you doing?

125
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,100
But who's saying that's a
lie? Let's see. Let's see.

126
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,630
Let's see what it says. Jesus Christ.
You're so defensive. It's like,

127
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:25,950
do you work for the organization
now? I don't, but you're putting,

128
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,970
I'm saying you're using the Washington
Post. This is in the Washington.

129
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:35,010
What is it? Oh, the NBC. Okay. NBC.

130
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,330
Okay, so look man, I'm just reading what's
in front of me. I know. And I'm just,

131
00:07:39,331 --> 00:07:41,360
you're so emotional
about this is ridiculous.

132
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:46,290
Four cups of coffee and he shot too,
Huh? Oh, please let me know. I'm right.

133
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,820
I don't know.
You made each one.

134
00:07:47,821 --> 00:07:51,390
We're talking how many you don't know
that the mainstream media hates Trump.

135
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,900
I do.
Why would you put your fucking,

136
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:59,580
because I want to know whether or not they
are saying what? Stop. Stop doing that.

137
00:07:59,581 --> 00:08:01,790
Jamie. Go back to where
it was. You can't go.

138
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,800
Says Trump later said that he intended
the UN moment to garner a laugh that is

139
00:08:07,171 --> 00:08:09,660
repeated this claim.
Seriously since. Okay,

140
00:08:09,661 --> 00:08:14,130
so he says the admire administration
has accomplished more than almost any

141
00:08:14,131 --> 00:08:16,800
administration in the history
of the country. So this is just,

142
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,000
that's an expense as an example.
You're a bullshitter.

143
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,500
That's hyperbole and people were laughing
when he said that and so he was saying

144
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,960
that he meant to say it as a laugh.

145
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,080
There are hiring measures of success,

146
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,140
but it's not true that his administration
has been more successful than any

147
00:08:31,141 --> 00:08:34,440
other administration in history when
it comes to legislation. Trump aside,

148
00:08:34,441 --> 00:08:37,710
plenty of bills in first two years of
President Barack Obama in his first two

149
00:08:37,711 --> 00:08:40,650
years has significantly more
science, significantly more. Okay.

150
00:08:40,651 --> 00:08:42,510
This is just one thing. I
mean, I'm sure there's many,

151
00:08:42,511 --> 00:08:46,050
many other things that you can keep
going over and over again. I'm with you.

152
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,910
I'm not a bullshitter,

153
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,680
but I'm just saying all of a
sudden they keep score when it,

154
00:08:50,681 --> 00:08:55,410
when try [inaudible] he keeps score
because he lies so much keeping.

155
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:59,160
Who is keeping score when fucking
Hillary was secretary of state? Well,

156
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:03,030
it's a Santa trendwatching secretary of
state and I don't know how much she lied

157
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:05,250
as opposed to how much he learned.
There are a lot bigger.

158
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:09,600
There's a butter fuck fucking server and
about the Steele dossier that that is

159
00:09:09,601 --> 00:09:13,250
huge. That is getting under
covered like nobody's been that,

160
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,410
that dwarfs Watergate when
they unmask General Flynn that,

161
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:24,270
that, that dwarfs Watergate. Hmm. That's
an interesting combo. A conversation.

162
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,760
I don't know if that's the truth.
I don't know enough about Watergate but,

163
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:32,580
and [inaudible] felt that either. Is it
the coffee going on here? Well, yeah.

164
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:36,310
Why is it in strung out?
Could we queen freedom and emotional.

165
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,390
Not Emotional.
It's just I'm just you,

166
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,870
but you're acting as if I'm against you
and I'm not against me. Even if you were,

167
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:45,120
they'll be fine, but yet I'm
not, you're not against me,

168
00:09:45,121 --> 00:09:49,140
but I'm just saying to call Trump a
big ally than the fucking every other

169
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:51,330
politician is an exaggeration.

170
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,120
I told no by the mainstream
media who hates his guts.

171
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,070
I think most politicians are liars.

172
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,680
I think that's a lowly
accustomed to doing that.

173
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,860
But I think the way he lies is unusual.

174
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:07,860
I think it's the usual. It's just
an unusual, you don't think so?

175
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:12,750
He, he exaggerates like statements
like that as an exaggeration.

176
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,450
Although he did do a lot in
its first couple of years,

177
00:10:15,451 --> 00:10:17,550
would never get credit for it.
You know,

178
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,890
unless you watched Fox knows
you're not going to, but

179
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,820
would you agree that as you get older you
become more like more conservative now?

180
00:10:26,821 --> 00:10:27,930
I was always a bit of a Dick.

181
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,150
I got a tattoo of Nixon on my house.
I thought it was no,

182
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,500
I would say that was, that's a, what do
they say about if you're young, you know,

183
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,770
you're young and conservative,
you have no soul,

184
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,370
no heart old and liberal brilliance
to mind. Something like that.

185
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:50,400
Yeah, I would say that's true, but
I could always detect the bullshit.

186
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:51,390
And I mean,
I mean,

187
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,900
I remember watching CNN in an airport and
I first started comedy and that's like

188
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:58,620
1988 nine, you know, and getting
excited at some of the shit. Well,

189
00:10:58,621 --> 00:10:59,940
it's interesting because,
uh,

190
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:04,230
I don't disagree with you on
everything and I love you as a person.

191
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,540
You're a great guy. I liked you
a lot, always happy to see you,

192
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:10,260
but yet you and I here get a
little heated about this stuff.

193
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:13,440
But this is politics.
This is how divisive politics are.

194
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,650
If it even a person like me would
never, I would never fucking, Eh,

195
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,330
I would never leave here going,
I don't want to do that show again.

196
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,050
I have known each other.
We've known other for 30 years.

197
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,060
That's not the problem.

198
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:30,410
What I'm saying is I'm just using it
as an example of how divisive politics

199
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,480
absolutely. When people talk
to, I'm not afraid of it. No.

200
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:37,530
I mean a lot of people are, right?
Yes. Yeah. I, I'm not afraid of it.

201
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:41,850
A lot of people are fade of bad vibes
and bad feelings and this is one of the

202
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:45,990
things, but this is one of the things that
makes people tow the line, right? This,

203
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:50,580
the fear of this kind of altercation to
fear of this kind of like you don't want

204
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:55,000
that from inside your party, so
you, you start using they and them,

205
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,930
you start thinking that everyone should
be able to use any bathroom that they

206
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:03,130
feel like they identify with. You
start, you start going along the line.

207
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:06,610
It's one of the more interesting things
about politics is that if you tell me

208
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,240
that your Republican,
I can kind of guess your stance on God.

209
00:12:10,241 --> 00:12:13,540
I can kind of guess your stance
on being pro life pro choice,

210
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,800
second amendment rights.

211
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:17,950
It's like all those things sort of
fall in line and it's very interesting.

212
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:21,520
It's very interesting how you,
you sort of adopt, not you,

213
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:26,521
but people sort of adopt a whole
group of things when you decide you're

214
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:31,760
Republican, you decide you're a
Democrat, right? I don't, but yeah,

215
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,220
I don't think I fall into that.
