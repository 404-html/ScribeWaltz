1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,310
The joe rogan experience.
Cause some ideas just go away.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,880
Like they're so profound,
there's so profound.

3
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:10,350
But then a couple of
hours later you're like,

4
00:00:10,351 --> 00:00:15,210
what the fuck was I thinking that always
used to get me or I'd have this amazing

5
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:18,690
idea what I thought was an
amazing idea. And then I go, ah,

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,600
that's such a good idea. I'll remember
it in the morning and I go to sleep.

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,700
I know I still pull that shit. I've
never remembered it. No, no, never.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,680
I still pull that. I go, what
are you doing if my phone,

9
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:32,460
if I didn't have my charger now I finally
got a cord and it's next to the bed.

10
00:00:32,461 --> 00:00:36,450
So I always have a cord to plug in my
phone. But uh, never. Why do I not?

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,200
Not half the time. Never. And I
still have dinner. I'll go out. No,

12
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:43,770
cause that's a good idea.
Never Hedberg had a joke about that.

13
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,450
Too Lazy and too lazy to get up to
get a pen to write something down.

14
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,690
So I just convinced myself it wasn't
that funny in the first place.

15
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:56,010
But what's great is that that was a
bit he did on stage and it would kill,

16
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:01,350
I mean, I didn't do it. Well,
I don't remember the way
you got to just, you know,

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,000
the used to, we were thinking, okay,
I used to do drugs. I still do,

18
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:09,990
but I used to too. Yes. So
last night we were saying,

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,900
I used to do Mitch Hedberg.

20
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,480
I used to do drugs. I still do, but
I used to too. I mean, I still do,

21
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:21,660
but I used to do too. Okay. I know
I, let me back up for a second.

22
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:25,830
So I do Mitch Doing Rodney Dangerfield.
You know, I do Rodney, if he did, Mitch,

23
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,740
I'll be like, I'll tell her the other
day guys, I used to do drugs. I still do,

24
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:31,770
but I used to to, you know, do,

25
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:36,120
do any Mitch Hedberg joke is Rodney and
it's, and it's killed the other day.

26
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:39,240
It goes from, if I wanted a
banana, you know, I said, no,
I want a regular one later.

27
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:41,720
So, all right. You know? Right. You
know, what are you gonna do, man?

28
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,750
So I do the use too.
I hope this goes somewhere,

29
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,620
so I used I,
I did the Altoid.

30
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,430
I used to do drugs so my friend
asked me if I still do that. He I go,

31
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,340
I used to do the Mitch Hedberg. I still
do drugs but I used to too. I still do,

32
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:01,800
but I used to to do something in that.

33
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,660
It's amazing that you
kept it all together.

34
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,760
I did for somebody used to to use to
sense it makes sense, but you nailed it.

35
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:11,520
You dismounted.
I shouldn't try feet flat on the ground.

36
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,720
It's a solid this mountain.
There's no stumble. No, it
was good. That was very good.

37
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,690
Thank you. That's very good.
Thank you Mitch. He's like,

38
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,400
to me one of the more amazing comedians
ever because what he would do was a

39
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,850
complete nonsequitors. He would go from
one non sequitur to another non sequitur.

40
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,520
Nothing connected together other than
here. Here's some other shit I thought up.

41
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,240
You know, here's what the Shit I
wrote down and even know not through.

42
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,450
Probably a good idea for everyone
to know that does one liners,

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,630
that there still has to be
an essence of you and them.

44
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:46,500
Like even though he's jokes didn't segue
together like they seem you're still,

45
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:50,440
you knew who he was, but his jokes
obviously like, oh, he had, you know,

46
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,640
he definitely had, they're not just
individual jokes just glued all together.

47
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,230
They were all so silly too. Right,
exactly. That's the thing about,

48
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,190
I've said the best

49
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,100
way to describe him. He's like one of
my favorite silly comedians. I know.

50
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:06,160
It's funny, a lot of people you
don't hear always complimentary.

51
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:10,180
Of course it's silly. And that's
what I realized later after he died.

52
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:14,680
Like how silly. He was. Silly, so
silly. That was who he was. Very silly.

53
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:16,500
So that's what you know about him.
You know,

54
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:19,300
he was the type of comedian
he would get into his rhythm.

55
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:22,720
Like I would listen to him a lot of times
on the way to the airport because uh,

56
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,650
I was,
you know,

57
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,490
that traffic on the way to the airports
and knowing he just wanted to just chill

58
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:32,320
out, giggle. So I'd put on some Mitch
Hedberg I just be fucking giggling like,

59
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:36,400
and when you're just smiling when
you're not, when he's, you know,

60
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:39,160
in between punchlines and just have
a big smile on your face. Cause he,

61
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,420
he would put on this silly vibe and you
would get caught up in it cause it was

62
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:48,370
really fun. And then he had
such great writing too and
playful. It was, yeah. Yeah.

63
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,330
Yeah.
And

64
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:57,220
I think in Rodney had a lot of that
too. You know, Rodney's seriously,

65
00:03:57,221 --> 00:04:00,730
seriously underrated
comedian and his style.

66
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,620
There was a great article
about it recently,

67
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:05,380
didn't we talk about this on the podcast?
That Rod,

68
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,620
there was an article that was
written recently about Rodney,

69
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,170
I forget who wrote it,
like Esquire or one of those things,

70
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,620
but they were talking about how long
it took him to become a good comedian.

71
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,620
That it wasn't until he was like in
his fifties that he figured it out.

72
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:25,360
And it's like talking about him boiling
down his act and talking about how many,

73
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,070
cutting all the fat out of his act.

74
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:30,940
If you go back and listen to his early
performances and you could see is more

75
00:04:30,941 --> 00:04:33,320
meandering and then
towards the more standup B.

76
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,530
I realized that a few years ago and
he listened to the old ones and uh,

77
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,930
he would like, in other words that
Joe could be, it was still Rodney,

78
00:04:39,931 --> 00:04:42,840
but it would be like, this is more
of a joke. A comedian would tell,

79
00:04:42,841 --> 00:04:44,700
not really one line, it'd be
like, you know, like, you know,

80
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,280
you're getting old when your family
tells you, you know, when you,

81
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,990
when they're friendly
talks in front of you, hey,

82
00:04:48,991 --> 00:04:51,930
you know what pops in the garage.
We've got people coming over, you know,

83
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,170
pop just sits there and drools you know,

84
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:58,290
but that was more like a piece
and I forgot about that, Rodney.

85
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,700
And then there's a lot of, you know, just
a short little stories, but they're not,

86
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:07,500
and then all of a sudden I saw him,

87
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,700
my member Bob Nelson. Yes.
God, Nelson Open for him.

88
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:14,850
And then I got to meet Rodney
backstage through Bob. And you know,

89
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:18,450
it is when you think, you know something,
it plays with everything. Sexism,

90
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,190
you think you know what it is,
but you really don't.

91
00:05:20,191 --> 00:05:21,840
There's still a lot more to learn.
Of course,

92
00:05:21,841 --> 00:05:23,670
I knew what timing was
before I saw Rodney.

93
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:28,210
I could tell you I was a comedian for
10 years at that point, but I know it.

94
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:33,060
Timing is, but then when you saw right
now when, oh fuck, that's timing.

95
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,620
It was like, I knew what it was, but I
just got a doctor in and what it was.

96
00:05:37,621 --> 00:05:41,580
I just saw it delivered like the
best of the best of the best and it,

97
00:05:41,581 --> 00:05:45,390
and I go now that I like, I, I
mean it was just crazy with the,

98
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,600
to every turn and every, and
then just, just when you think,

99
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:52,700
how can he take you anywhere? And then
the band kicks in and then he's sharks,

100
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,530
like, you know, doing bedding
music and all this the other day,

101
00:05:55,531 --> 00:05:58,400
and my wife was shoot on and then
the pump, they got bigger and bigger.

102
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,040
Then he started singing this
song because everybody sang them.

103
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:04,370
But Rodney did it in his own way.
He starts going, you know, uh,

104
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,070
something about to dream that
whatever the song is. And then he,

105
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,640
he does about 10 seconds of it. And then
he goes, what the fuck am I singing?

106
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,730
Four, I'm watching them. I'm good. Oh

107
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,790
God to you that just a bed. But, uh,
he goes, I know that it's bad to you.

108
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:24,000
They're just a band. But to me
they're a bunch of fucking idiots.

109
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,050
And then the band has their taught,
cause they're all, you know,

110
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,850
Pete Musicians from that city, obviously
they're taught, you know, he goes, no,

111
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:36,000
don't tell you what they are. They're not.
And then they all stand up and they go,

112
00:06:36,001 --> 00:06:37,380
we're fucking idiot.

113
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,600
I got to see Rodney when
I was 19, when I was, uh,

114
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,400
working as a security guard,
a great woods.

115
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,480
Great Woods is a concert place
in Mansfield, Massachusetts.

116
00:06:51,481 --> 00:06:56,460
And Rodney was there in the bathrobe era.
Did you see bathrobe? Ron Rodney. Oh,

117
00:06:56,461 --> 00:06:58,740
he went out on stage in a bathroom naked.

118
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:03,950
The bathrobe on the Improv,
you would show up. You see,

119
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,250
he was doing this arenas.
This place is big break.

120
00:07:08,251 --> 00:07:11,130
Great Woods is like thousand people.

121
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,090
Isn't that great in a way that he was a
fucking maniac. He was a fucking maniac.

122
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,970
He was amazing.
He was so free.

123
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,020
He was hanging backstage and
apparently his caucus, enormous,

124
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,410
his cock and balls were just hanging out.
He didn't give a fuck.

125
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,220
He's just got this bathrobe on and he's
got his legs crossed and his fucking

126
00:07:29,221 --> 00:07:32,790
sack is hanging down and the
security guards would be like,

127
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:37,170
what the fuck do, I didn't
see that. I only saw him,

128
00:07:37,171 --> 00:07:41,340
it's like a big foot siding. And I met
him later in life. But to me like in 19,

129
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,460
I hadn't even thought about doing standup
yet, but it was such a huge fan of it.

130
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,740
He walked from, you know, like,

131
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,440
like you're looking down the hallway to
where his dressing rooms and he walked

132
00:07:49,441 --> 00:07:51,530
from one room to another. It
was like, what big foot side?

133
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:53,850
And like I always saw him for a second,
but I saw Rodney,

134
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,050
it's like that. It's, you know,
I said seeing Rodney was like,

135
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,820
it's not like seeing, uh, the,
the, you saw Paul Mccartney.

136
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,250
Yeah, you'd freak out. But seeing,

137
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:08,490
Rodney was like getting to see
if you saw Fred Flintstone,

138
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,290
you can't see Fred Flintstone.
He's a cartoon. Rodney.

139
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:16,500
So larger than life that
it was overwhelming.

140
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,460
You weren't just going,

141
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,810
taking in someone that was a celebrity
and you see on TV and there he is.

142
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,540
There he is like three feet from you.
And you'd be like,

143
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,180
fuck, that's Rodney. What does
that between his legs? No,

144
00:08:28,181 --> 00:08:32,770
shut up balls. It's kind of being covered
by something. Is that real? Yeah. Oh,

145
00:08:32,771 --> 00:08:36,670
that's his balls. That's a sack or
his dick or both. He's an animal.

146
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,610
I would have bought, Nelson would
have great stories about like,

147
00:08:39,611 --> 00:08:43,450
and they were so specific and you knew
Rodney said them and it was just so a

148
00:08:43,451 --> 00:08:47,950
couple came up to him after their wedding
and they go, do you know this one?

149
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,960
No. And they go, uh, uh, [inaudible] he
was trying to gamble. You know, Rodney,

150
00:08:52,961 --> 00:08:55,620
we just got married. What do
you think? And he goes, uh,

151
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,330
you both could have done better.

152
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:06,210
What do you think is done better?
Huh? That's a welded sky's insult.

153
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,430
I'm telling you.
That's a beautiful Joe goes.

154
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:11,940
People won't know that it was an Esl till
they get in their car. Wait a second.

155
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:16,150
That means he says, we're poet. What?
We're both ugly. It's get cancel now.

156
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,920
That's playing ping pong in their head.
Don't talk to you both good and said,

157
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,160
is that an insult to the wife?
Goes, it's an insult to you.

158
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,670
I think it's both of us.
You Moron.

159
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:35,680
Okay.
