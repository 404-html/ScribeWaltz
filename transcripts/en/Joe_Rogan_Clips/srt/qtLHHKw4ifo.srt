1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:01,990
Alright. I think this, this,

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,300
I think you guys talked him about aliens
to fucking really boost your search

3
00:00:06,301 --> 00:00:10,620
engine results on Youtube. I eliminated
from all search engine results,

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,790
but I really doubt you'll be penalized
for this and show you should say

5
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:17,370
something about that. Like you're an
American, you're allowed to talk to me.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,930
Here's are going to say Joe Rogan had
Jones on to say no one died of sandy hook

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,890
be as well.
I don't think anyone's going to say that,

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,970
but people probably will say some things,
but I think also,

9
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:34,971
you know the idea that like anybody
should be able to tell you that you can't

10
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:37,800
talk anymore ever.

11
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:41,520
If you said one thing that people
don't like or if you do talk,

12
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:45,510
it has to be only on your side and you
have to be trapped out of all of the

13
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:50,490
different platforms for social media.
That's a slippery,

14
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:54,170
slippery slope, you know, and other
training. But here's the thing, I,

15
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,000
you're not a hateful person.
I know you're not a hateful person.

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,920
You may have said things that are angry
in the past about certain people or been

17
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:05,460
angry about a certain event in the news,
but you're not a hurtful, angry person.

18
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,120
If there's things that you
say that they can say, hey,

19
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:13,500
this violates some sort
of a pattern of behavior.

20
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:15,930
You're attacking someone,
you're giving out someone's address.

21
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,530
That kind of shit they should be able
to take it down to be able to show is,

22
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:21,510
that's not, that's not speeches
here. I'm not doing it.

23
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:22,500
That's what I was going to get to.

24
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,030
There should be a clear set of rules and
you could look at these rules the way a

25
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:31,590
lawyer would look at him and say, is
this in violation? Is My client arrested?

26
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,170
Well know your client didn't
have anything illegal on him,

27
00:01:34,171 --> 00:01:37,990
and we did a search and we found no drugs
and we found no illegal weapons. So,

28
00:01:37,991 --> 00:01:40,320
but we suspected that
he was up to something.

29
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,020
Like he's talking just
in closing to say this,

30
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,960
I don't want to make myself the
center of this. At the end of the day,

31
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,290
Info wars went from really successful and
huge to light zeitgeisty and shame and

32
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,170
you take any responsibility for any
of that. Do you think there's a human,

33
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:56,010
I'm not perfect.
Right?

34
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,850
Do you think that maybe it made it easy
for some of the people that were going

35
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:03,570
to attack you and I've been guilty of
this myself by providing fuel saying

36
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:08,490
stupid shit contact. Yes. That's
what I'm saying is they say it,

37
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,640
it's, it's, it's global. It's
fun at a big corporation.

38
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,040
This is what I'm to say in closing,
it's come out,

39
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:17,250
we're going to release this shit,
but the thing is it's all left wing.

40
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,150
That's where it's weird,
but there's a problem.

41
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:23,880
It's a problem because you have one
ideology that's overwhelmingly and control

42
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:28,881
of tech and I agree with them on a lot
of things on on social programs and a lot

43
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:34,320
of it on welfare and universal
basic income and civil
rights and women's rights.

44
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,970
I agree with them on a lot of stuff,

45
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,790
but it's an ideology like any
idea how you have to jump.

46
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,660
They were wrong but it doesn't have
free speech in it. There's a lot of,

47
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,940
there's a lot of y'all.
I just learned all this two weeks ago,

48
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,420
but I got documents. I'll come back
if you want, but you just let it ride.

49
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,260
I've been attacking the left for doing
it and they're the instrumental group

50
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,070
that's carrying it out. He would take
what? Defend if you're right wing fascist,

51
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,050
who you get to go after for each patient.

52
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,680
Do you get the left trunk of you?

53
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:04,630
Trick them and I'm not working.

54
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,420
Right wing is tricking the left
wing and the shutting down.

55
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,930
Free speech off confirmed.
Oh Jesus Christ.

56
00:03:09,931 --> 00:03:13,540
I have confirmed it's Goddamn
conundrum that the Republican party,

57
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,910
not the the average,
you know tea party people.

58
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,080
The Republican party is blue blood.
It thinks it runs the Democrats

59
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,380
and it learned what was happening and I
can come back for a whole shovey one on

60
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:30,730
this one. Come on my show about it.
No, seriously. I'll come on your show.

61
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:31,870
I'm going to be in and
that's another part.

62
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,190
I'm going to be at a Cap City Comedy Club
in Austin. Promise amateur coming home.

63
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,050
I'm coming on are good. I'm coming on.
I'm not just saying this, I swear to God,

64
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:43,600
dude, I'll bring it to that stuff about
me. I'll tell you the bad stuff about me.

65
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:46,330
I'm telling you the truth here.
I believe you that tobacco was amazing,

66
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:47,170
but it was pretty good stuff.

67
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,300
You could transition my problem.
And why did you stand up?

68
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,980
Sure you could crush out show.
I'm not trying to lie.

69
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,100
Good. I'm not trying to like
bullshit like everybody else.

70
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,300
I'm telling you man. I, I I,
the problem is, it's so real.

71
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:12,670
Like every time I forget what I was
gonna say, what was I talking about?

72
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,650
You being a comic. Yeah. Man. I don't
know how to transition out of this.

73
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,900
What else you got planned?
We will be,

74
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:23,860
at the point we were just talking about
social media and Youtube and people

75
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:27,610
would be able to able to being able to
silence people and push their leftist

76
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:30,250
ideology or the right wing ideology.

77
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,520
He was saying that the Republicans
were manipulating the Democrats,

78
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,030
cause I know you're Shaker
it, you are empathetic real
guy. That's why I love you.

79
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,310
And you were kind of like
couldn't handle it anymore,

80
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:42,100
which I actually want to be like that.
So then you kind of dolled out.

81
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:43,360
So I was aggressive
because you look at it,

82
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,310
I have looked at all this stuff and I
have seen with their own perspectives and

83
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:52,120
their own plans are, and they go to
Congress and they lie about all of it.

84
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,680
They're not liberal than conservative.

85
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,550
It's big corporations lining up
with China as you shared earlier,

86
00:04:57,551 --> 00:05:00,820
to unify the propaganda to
quote influence China. No Dude,

87
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:02,350
they get all the technology.
We,

88
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:05,290
they've used our open
society to totally take over.

89
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:09,640
And so that's what I'm trying to get
through to you is that is that they're

90
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:11,680
coming after everybody.
Like you said earlier,

91
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,430
when I first met you today that you
walk into the office, I was here,

92
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,430
Tim is for you to go.

93
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:20,260
I want to talk about the thing you said
about the censorship and how once they

94
00:05:20,261 --> 00:05:21,950
get is to submit. We're broken. No,

95
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,510
it's what you said was it that it was
a slippery slope that if you give in 1%

96
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,020
it's 1% I still have this other other
99% and they just start moving the

97
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:32,650
boundaries. They started moving in closer
and closer and then 100% makes sense.

98
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:37,120
People exist in these,
these control patterns.

99
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:42,280
It's really common. They keep asking me
like, oh, when are you going to give up?

100
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:46,360
Everything's okay. As soon as you do like
wondering everything's gonna be okay.

101
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,760
What does that mean? What does
it, what does give up mean?

102
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,900
You stopped talking so people enjoy
watching. This is where it gets weird.

103
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,040
If people enjoy watching you
talk and other people don't,

104
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,790
why can't the Bbu don't just not
watch you talk. What is going on here?

105
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,610
He's promoting truth.
He is promoted truth.

106
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:09,850
But I think what they've done is they've
found these little pockets of things

107
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:12,590
and planning ahead.
Well that too,

108
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:15,460
but things that you said that maybe
you shouldn't to threaten everybody.

109
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,560
Like I don't want to put down the route
this up. I Make Jack Dorsey, this villain,

110
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,530
no,
that like we had pool and it's true.

111
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,940
They had millions of people harassing
the stock and attacking him lying on.

112
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:27,920
He's currently attacking children.

113
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,970
He's trying to attack children at their
houses and so it wasn't the fact that

114
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:35,540
I've gotten a CNA guy's face and I get
as a shareholder in a company owner,

115
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,380
I'm not defending Jack Dorsey or whatever
his name is. Yeah. What's the guy,

116
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:42,120
the other guy to want to know who the
other Guy Jack Dorsey's. The Twitter guys?

117
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:42,351
Yeah,

118
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:47,300
the jet and there's no other Darcy and
it's all admitted is what I'm saying is

119
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:49,790
I'm not even that guy's enemy.
I just,

120
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:54,410
I understand like he had millions of
people attacking the shareholders.

121
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:58,070
Did you hear about,
there's a chef that makes pastries,

122
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:03,330
which he's worked there 10
years at Trump's hotel in
Florida and buzzfeed found

123
00:07:04,071 --> 00:07:07,280
out who she was and doctor and said,

124
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:11,840
she's a cult member fire. You're
like, what does that even mean?

125
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,650
Like why would anybody
harass a pastry chef?

126
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,500
That's a very good question. People
feel like they're a war, you know?

127
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,230
That's part of the problem
with all this shit.

128
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:24,500
That's why I was saying be reasonable.
People feel like they're at war,

129
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:25,670
the right versus the left,

130
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,180
instead of just being a bunch of people
talking about trying to figure it out,

131
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:34,040
at least take on Hillary or Alex shows
or are, or Bill Clinton or Donald Trump.

132
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,680
Well, Shit's winters
again. Pastry chef. Yeah.
