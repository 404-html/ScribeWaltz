1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,480
Do you guys want to go to Phoenix
to see Cain fight in Ghana?

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,680
You want to just fucking get on with
it. Is that it's like, it's Sunday.

3
00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:11,910
It's a Sunday. I could do it. I'm thinking
about just fucking flying to Phoenix.

4
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:16,350
I never go to a live USC as a fan,
but I want to see Cain versus in Ghana.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,680
In the arena though. 100%.
I was going to snipe me out.

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,270
It was going to stop you. Oh, I don't
know. Days with me. Well, the four of us,

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,210
the of us go live.

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,710
We'll put fucking snapchat
cameras on our eyeglasses. What?

9
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:39,630
What is the date? It's crazy. It's
a Sunday night. It's the 17th.

10
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,380
We check every free coun.
Yup.

11
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,890
You got me down for that. Would
you want to do, do it? I'd do it.

12
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:52,580
Take a private jet as long as it's not
this weekend talking to Eddie indicting

13
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:56,970
murdered fun man. That seems stressed
about it. Oh, look at this boy.

14
00:00:56,971 --> 00:01:01,490
Your boy's got good. Uh, you're, you're a
DM buddy has got good takedown beef. Yes,

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,570
that does. Cause he knew he's fighting a
wrestler, Bro. Oh, blocked second round.

16
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:10,220
Two rounds for the, for Ben,
they had two friends. Canes.

17
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:15,270
An epic fight is an epic fight.
I really, how about this?

18
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,750
Not even, not even a little
bit epic. Here's why. Why?

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,740
Because Mr and Ghana all due
respect. Great Athlete. Two years.

20
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,650
Okay. Once again, Keynes had 150
surgeries. How it goes. He's 37 years old.

21
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,490
A fake skull. How it goes. Ready? Okay.

22
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,610
Is it lower down and then punches
in the face until it's over?

23
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:41,680
I don't think so.
It might not to be like Jds,

24
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,880
I think can get to a hundred I
hate to agree with Brian, but yeah,

25
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,870
never agreed on anything.
It's true.

26
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,290
Wrestling, you went to knock
them out like jds did. Cain wins,

27
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,110
but I don't think he gets a single.

28
00:01:59,111 --> 00:02:01,160
I can just take some technologies
and shows him getting

29
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,200
his head in his chest and his bank.

30
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:08,730
JDS in Ghana is fucking
dangerous unless you have cardio.

31
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,430
He shown something to fight.
He didn't know what the fuck he was doing.

32
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,200
He thought, well, the Steve Bay fight,

33
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:15,780
he thought he was gonna
win that fight by chaos.

34
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,350
He thought he was just going
to go out there and Kale.

35
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,160
He did land good shots on top Curtis
blades and that second fight and Curtis

36
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:23,640
blades is a good wrestler in,
Jeez.

37
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,740
What would be Mark Curtis
plates in that second fight?

38
00:02:26,741 --> 00:02:28,750
You got to remember he just
fucked up Curtis bleeds.

39
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,140
I totally forgot about that and forgot
about it. That's why I went for the FCA.

40
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,640
And you're gonna have a hard
time getting in the arena

41
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,160
companion. Hey guys, there's
a fight. Let's get more.

42
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,640
Be Funny to do a fight companion,
but travel, I always travel so,

43
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,450
but I was thinking we're going to
be taking it to the bottom on page

44
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,060
a party.
Have a good time.
