1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,950
We really do need to get back to
some kind of productive discussion,

2
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:09,951
productive politics where the far right
disowned near lunatics and we disown are

3
00:00:09,991 --> 00:00:14,991
lunatics and we get back to work
about whatever the ocean's plastic,

4
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:16,740
whatever it is that we're talking about,

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,890
because right now the
discourse is corrupted it.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,500
We're not doing what we
need to do in the academies.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,820
These people are continuing to pump out
this nonsense that's totally untethered

8
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:30,300
to reality. It's a huge problem.
I'm sick of it. You're sick of it.

9
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:33,360
We're all sick and we're sick
of, I'm sick of it. I've had it.

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,180
I've had it with these folks.
It just doesn't seem,

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,530
it doesn't seem like it's
sustainable. It's it. It's,

12
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,030
it seems like some weird,

13
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,360
it's going to run out of energy towards
eating itself constantly eats itself

14
00:00:46,361 --> 00:00:46,781
like we did.

15
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:50,530
The thing about the people of color and
the black indigenous people of color

16
00:00:50,531 --> 00:00:51,700
that they fragmented.

17
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,910
You see when you get into the critical
race literature that it's like, okay,

18
00:00:54,911 --> 00:00:57,890
so you're brown or you're black,
but you have slightly lighter skin,

19
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,010
slightly darker skin, slightly
darker than that. Really dark.

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,070
They have different levels of privilege
and it's just cutting things apart.

21
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:07,060
The idea though that this is going to
create some kind of a coalition that can

22
00:01:07,061 --> 00:01:11,380
then defeat, you know, the plurality
or something like that is ridiculous.

23
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,650
So what do you see?
You see this stuff's starting to blow up.

24
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,200
You see the Democrats bleed seats,

25
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,920
they've lost like a thousand legislative
seats across the u s since Obama got

26
00:01:20,921 --> 00:01:25,180
elected in Oh eight how are you going
to get your agenda if you don't have any

27
00:01:25,181 --> 00:01:29,250
legislators, if you don't have anybody
elected. And so then what happens?

28
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,220
2016 I can't say that the
reason that Trump got elected,

29
00:01:33,221 --> 00:01:35,680
because there's lots of reasons
it had something to do. No,

30
00:01:35,681 --> 00:01:38,890
I will say I had something to do with
this because every conservative person I

31
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:43,390
know that's not just a reactionary is
like, and I live in the south east man.

32
00:01:43,391 --> 00:01:46,360
I know some conservatives,
most of my friends are conservatives,

33
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:47,580
cause I don't have a choice if I,

34
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,260
if I want to have friends that they're
going to be conservatives who lives there.

35
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,920
So I talked to them and they're like,
Oh yeah,

36
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:56,700
they're tearing down this kind
of statue. Oh yeah. It's tough.

37
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,170
And it's not like they're tearing down
confederate statues are talking 10 on

38
00:01:59,171 --> 00:02:03,970
Thomas Jefferson. You know?
It's like there. George
Washington, George Washington.

39
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,170
Halloween's a problem. Then I didn't
know. You didn't know how his problem,

40
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,380
what are you going as for Halloween?
I'm a shark. You're a shark.

41
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,110
My kids are mermaids.
My problematic. Oh God.

42
00:02:14,111 --> 00:02:15,550
If they're mermaids and you're a shark,

43
00:02:15,551 --> 00:02:19,240
you're definitely taking like a
dominant and power position. Power.

44
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,480
They pick my outfit. I don't
pick my outfit. I have kids. Oh,

45
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,370
they tell me what I am. That's
an issue, but I don't know.

46
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:28,570
I'll try to figure out a paper for it.
