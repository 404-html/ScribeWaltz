00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,610
Hello Freak bitches now when I ran into
in Denver, which was a fucking fun night.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,220
That was fun, man. It was
a fun night. You know,

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,960
Roy was there the night that
Chappelle showed up at my, uh,

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,900
late show on Friday night. And by the
way, I was watching you. So it's like,

5
00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:16,620
cause I knew we were going to grow and
afterwards and have some drinks and chat

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,140
and then Chappelle came in and
at the comedy cellar in New York,

7
00:00:20,141 --> 00:00:23,940
Chappelle comes in a lot, but when he
comes in and the seller, it's like, well,

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,120
he'll be on stage for seven hours.
You know what I mean? Oh yeah.

9
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:31,860
Hell go on stage sometimes for like five
hours and five hours. Five hours. Yeah.

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,070
Like regularly.
Not regularly,

11
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:38,310
but it happens like to the point where
like some dude in the back of sweeping up,

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,650
you know what I mean? It's like, yeah,

13
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,240
he's just on state smoking
butts doing this stuff. But uh,

14
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,790
so when he first got on stage, I'm like,
oh no. I looked at my girlfriend go,

15
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,350
we're never going out with Joe tonight.
I'm like,

16
00:00:46,351 --> 00:00:48,390
we're going to be watching Chappelle
til seven in the morning, you know?

17
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,210
But he did, you know, he did
it like, what, 20 minutes
or something. It was cool.

18
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,000
He didn't do that much time. I mean,
it was the end of the show, you know,

19
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:54,660
it was late.

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,630
I guess maybe you would assume that
Denver people don't have the stamina that

21
00:00:57,631 --> 00:01:00,480
New York City people have. I
think so. When he just five hours.

22
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:03,210
How many people are still there
after five hours? I'm never there,

23
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:06,980
so I couldn't tell you. I have to leave
after like an hour, but uh, wow. You know,

24
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,350
people will stay through the whole
thing, but like not everybody, you know?

25
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,300
It's so weird. Yeah. But he's, I
mean, he know he's, I don't know.

26
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,800
I could watch Chapelle forever. He's such
a good dude, but he definitely, like I,

27
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:19,980
I've never really hung out with him.

28
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,710
I've talked to him a bunch but never hung
out with him. And everyone's like, dude,

29
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:24,600
hanging out Chappelles the best.
And that night I was like,

30
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,260
I don't think he likes me very much.
I don't know.

31
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,200
We were just hanging out with me. We don't
think you like to, it just got to send,

32
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,190
we all went out. Yeah.
No I didn't, you know,

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,360
it was one of those things where I'm like,

34
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,070
every time I say like he definitely liked
my girlfriend, you know what I mean?

35
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,000
Like it, he was talking to her. No,

36
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,610
not when I just meant like he
was definitely like, I was like,

37
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:44,040
so you ever really have that where
you can't get a rhythm with someone?

38
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,440
I was going to be talking to
him and be like, all right,

39
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:50,660
well that story's not gonna fly. Like I
had that, like I couldn't get like, uh,

40
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,830
that's weird. That's your
perception. That's interesting.

41
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:57,680
Cause I think generally speaking
that nobody ever likes me. I've seen,

42
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,890
my perception was it was a fun night. It
was, we went bar hop, we went to these,

43
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,100
I've been to Denver. That's speakeasy
was credit your times? Yeah.

44
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,060
We went to these places that you'd go
down an alleyway, you pass a dumpster,

45
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:12,600
you go through an unmarked door and we're
in this weird secret bar and I'm like,

46
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:15,090
what is this bar man? You have
to know. What it reminded me of,

47
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,450
it was like that scene in Goodfellas
where he's like, you want some dresses,

48
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:23,280
Karen? She's like, no, no, no.
He said, go ahead, go down a
couple of old garage doors,

49
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:27,030
make a left and then she just drives away.
That's what it was. Everyone was like,

50
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:29,310
yeah, there's a bar. Just
keep going and make a left.

51
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:32,190
We're like down this alley or the
hackles on the back of my neck where

52
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:38,210
USC legend Joe Rogan or I'm not going
to this bar. I was going to run dude,

53
00:02:38,211 --> 00:02:39,044
and he's stuck.

54
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:44,010
I'm not taking a bike that I'm thinking
of running and leaving you guys behind.

55
00:02:44,011 --> 00:02:46,080
It's so fun. Yeah, it was.
It was cool though. It's fun.

56
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,500
We got kicked out of two places for
smoking weed to two different places.

57
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:52,380
It told you couldn't smoke week. His Day
will just spark up a joint in a regular,

58
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:57,030
people just light up a cigarette, you
know, restaurant give a shit that is,

59
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,700
that's a weird thing that just a,
he's like missing a,

60
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:03,910
I don't give a fuck cause like he's out,
he's got a gene like an,

61
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,920
I don't give a fuck gene.
He's like missing a give a
fuck. I know it's not there.

62
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,480
And, and uh, the, you know,

63
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:13,210
the best comics to me are the
ones who don't give a fuck. Yeah.

64
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,910
And that dude triple doesn't give a fuck.

65
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,360
So like that's why he's so good on stage
because he really doesn't give a shit.

66
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,740
We were out till like, well, after four
o'clock in the morning and there was a DJ,

67
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,680
we went to some place,
there was a DJ and uh, the,

68
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,680
the Dj starts playing and there's like
literally like 10 of us in this bar mic.

69
00:03:31,681 --> 00:03:32,890
How's this place stay open?

70
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:34,960
It's like they were just
happy to have Chappelle there.

71
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,410
I think Chappelle even went
up to the DJ and was like,

72
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,770
and then plugged in his music. He
was like, I got this. Yeah. The Jews.

73
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,900
He plucked it miss the Chappelle. Yeah.
It was fucking do such a trip. Well,

74
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:51,500
Dave brings these two
huge, uh, they're like, um,

75
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,570
you know those, uh, Bluetooth
Speakers, a JVC Bluetooth speakers.

76
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,620
He's got these big boxes. Yeah. He
brings two of them. They're huge.

77
00:03:59,621 --> 00:04:02,110
They're like the size of
bigger than football, right.

78
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,840
So he brings two of them
and their sync together.

79
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:08,590
So one's left and one's right and he'll
put them on opposite ends of his Green

80
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,550
Room and blare music. And I
was asking him about, I go,

81
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,660
why you carry these fucking
things around? He goes, Joe,

82
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,440
my only socializing I
do is in green rooms.

83
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,130
It's like the only socializing. That's the
only time I hang out with people. I go,

84
00:04:21,131 --> 00:04:24,160
what do you do with those? Or I'm by
myself. I mean, I live in Dayton, Ohio.

85
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,190
He lives in the middle of nowhere.
On a fucking font or form. Yeah.

86
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,490
What a cool dude though.
He's hilarious.

87
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:34,750
He's a really unique guy and a lot of
ways. He's also, he's also just, um,

88
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:35,830
it's,

89
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:40,830
it's very impressive to see somebody
who's that like kind of legendary at stand

90
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:45,670
up and walk into a place and
people are like, Oh shit, you even,

91
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,430
whatever level comic is it,
Oh shit, your pals here.

92
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:52,300
And then him also just be cool. Like in
other words, he doesn't have to be cool.

93
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,040
Well, yeah, when he's not aloof
at all, he's super friendly. Yup.

94
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,560
But I think he definitely has like a
little bit of a wall up for guys like you.

95
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,290
Yeah. That's why when you came
up to me like, Hey, what's
going on buddy? He's like,

96
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,610
because I'm like, I'm not, the
dude wants my phone number.
Yeah, I got it here. Yeah,

97
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:09,130
exactly. And I'm like, I definitely
know what your phone number,

98
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,590
but we're just going to be
getting hammered together, man.

99
00:05:10,591 --> 00:05:13,690
It might as well talk a little
bit. Yeah. Yeah. We, we, uh,

100
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:17,200
we pulled it out until like, I
left him there. I left near like,

101
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,180
before I left, like four, four 30. I
was like, I gotta go to Denver is a,

102
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,370
is a fun town.

103
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:33,270
Okay.
