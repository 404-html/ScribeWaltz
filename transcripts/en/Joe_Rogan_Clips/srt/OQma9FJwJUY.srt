1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,340
This conversation, most
conversations, it's an,

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:07,820
it's not you making a statement and
me just reacting to that. Like the,

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,240
our conversation of all is based on what
we say, we can interrupt one another,

4
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:15,630
we can, you know, we can
completely change the subject.

5
00:00:15,631 --> 00:00:19,710
I can take control of the conversation
and the people who might find that

6
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:23,970
interesting follow it and the folks
that don't just stop listening,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,770
whereas you can't do that in
a post comment model. Yeah.

8
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:33,060
It's also text is so
limited there. It's, I mean,

9
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:36,030
it's great for just
getting out actual facts,

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,630
but it's also thinking it's just so
close to thinking like if there's no

11
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:42,030
composition, you know, and, and that's uh,

12
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,660
that to me is the most beautiful thing
about Twitter, but also something that,

13
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:51,360
you know, can be uncomfortable. Like
I, I can compose my life on Instagram.

14
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,390
I can compose my thoughts within a
Facebook post and it can look so perfect,

15
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,390
but the best of Twitter is
just super raw and it's right.

16
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,220
It's right to the thinking process.

17
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,190
And I just think that's so
beautiful because it gets to,

18
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,480
it gets to consciousness. It gets to
something deeper and I think that defect,

19
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:15,600
how so? How is it different than a
post on Instagram or post on Facebook?

20
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,360
The speed demands, you know, the, the,

21
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,340
the character constraint, the speed
kind of just demands that, um,

22
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,970
a more conscious,

23
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,030
present focused thinking
versus like stepping back
and kind of closing a letter.

24
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,430
Yeah. In composing a letter and
thinking about all the outcomes.

25
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,850
But oftentimes people do compose it
as a letter and they break it up into

26
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:42,030
separate 280 character posts.
The other threads.

27
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,500
What was the thought process and
going from one 40 to 80, because I,

28
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,980
the one thing that I liked about one
40 is that you can't be verbose. Yeah.

29
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,240
You can't just,
just ramble and you know,

30
00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:55,470
like it's great for comics because it
forces us to write jokes like with economy

31
00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:58,430
of words. Exactly. We, uh, we
found a lot of resonance with,

32
00:01:58,431 --> 00:02:02,320
with journalists because the headlines,
we found a lot of resonance with a,

33
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,490
with comics because of the rhythm.

34
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,640
And we found a lot of resonance with
hip hop as well because of the bars and

35
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:13,260
just the structure. And the
constraint allowed that that flow. Um,

36
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:19,280
the, the thinking was we
looked at, um, our, you know,

37
00:02:19,281 --> 00:02:22,380
languages around the world and,
and uh,

38
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,150
there's some languages like German, 140
characters. You can't really say much.

39
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,200
I can't really say much at all. The words
are so long. There are some languages,

40
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:34,350
like Japanese 140 characters is 140 words.

41
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:40,050
And what was interesting about Japan
was Japan is one of our largest,

42
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,320
our largest countries were,
were bigger than Facebook.

43
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:48,321
There were a lot bigger than Facebook
and America and know what the fuck.

44
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,580
I don't even use Facebook. Sorry.
Facebook. I don't either. I mean,

45
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,520
I use it in terms of a, if I
post something on Instagram,
it goes to Facebook.

46
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,130
But when I go to Facebook,
it's, it just seems like

47
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,280
a lot of both this dizzy like
Twitter to a lot of arguing.

48
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:08,410
But what is Twitter seems to be more fun,
if that makes any sense.

49
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,410
Even though it's,
there's a lot of chaos when something,

50
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,710
one of my favorite things when someone
post something stupid and then underneath

51
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:19,360
it is a bunch of jifs. We say gifs or
Jifs. I say Gif. Does anybody know?

52
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:20,770
Yes it is.

53
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:25,060
I guess the jury's out a bunch
of gifts that are hilarious.

54
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,600
Like I was just mocking
someone relentlessly.

55
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,100
Like though that is one of my favorite
things about Twitter. I wouldn't.

56
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,530
Someone like Donald Trump posts something
ridiculous and then I'll go and I'll

57
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:36,630
look at the responses. Right, right.

58
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,670
How don't care. It's a
public conversation. Yeah.

59
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,050
You can see how everyone interacts,
but like it's all,

60
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,290
the interesting thing about Twitter
is there's, there's not one Twitter.

61
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,270
It's like you have politics,
Twitter, which can be super toxic.

62
00:03:51,271 --> 00:03:55,530
You have sports, Twitter, you have
NBA, Twitter, you have MMA, Twitter,

63
00:03:55,531 --> 00:04:00,170
you have a UFC, Twitter, you have k
pop, Twitter, you have a black sports.

64
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,210
What are you up? Black Twitter.
That's Jamie's you. He loves black.

65
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:06,000
To have all these different
twitters and you and you have a,

66
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,140
you have a completely different
experience based on what Twitter are you

67
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,740
following. What do you
participate in? Some of them
were, are like super engaging,

68
00:04:13,741 --> 00:04:17,250
super funny. Some of them are, um,
do you want to walk away from it?
