1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,210
What kind of music you're listening to.
I listen to everything that they do.

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:07,230
I listen to. I was in a lot of classic
rock for whatever reason. But uh,

3
00:00:07,231 --> 00:00:10,770
I've been listening a lot of Kanye West
over the last few weeks talking about

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,070
Kanye. Yeah, well he's talking about
a lot of crazy shit. He's tired.

5
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:17,670
He actually talked about DMT in one of
his recent songs. He did that before.

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,170
I think he did. Oh Man. Why know
he's friends with kid cuddie kid cut.

7
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:25,950
He'd been in here and kid cut. He's
had some psychedelic experiences. Yeah.

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,800
Once you go to is your thumb, you didn't
want to do nothing else again. Well,

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,770
puts it all in the perspective.
It lets you see that, uh,

10
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,900
as much as this thing seems
to be important is all
temporary and you're a part

11
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:44,400
of forever and it also allows you
to become comfortable with death.

12
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,830
Yeah. Yeah. You know who said that?

13
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:50,220
Larry Hagman remember
that Guy Dallas from jr?

14
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,990
He did an interview with CNN and I dream
of Jeannie as well. Yeah, that's right.

15
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,950
He sprung it on him on CNN.
Once he was talking about how he did acid,

16
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,460
he took a big dose of acid and he's
never worried about death ever again.

17
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,350
That it just alleviated his,

18
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,820
his worry about passing on as wow,
this shit that could,

19
00:01:08,821 --> 00:01:11,780
I felt the same way I feel I have.
It doesn't matter anymore. Yeah.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I think DNT even more specifically
because they think the mind that way.

21
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,990
What causes the effect of mine?

22
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:22,650
That way they don't tell him
that his main Gig visioning,

23
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,720
visualize everything. They don't totally
know. They know that your brain makes it.

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,070
They know that your body makes it,

25
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:31,740
they should say and they know that it's
produced in your liver and their lungs

26
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:34,080
and there's some evidence now
cause they found it in rats,

27
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,660
that the pineal gland produces it,
which is like,

28
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:41,040
that's the third eye of eastern
mysticism that Glenn actually in rats,

29
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:44,790
they've proven produces DMT and they
think it does so on people too. You know,

30
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:45,331
once I did,

31
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:49,290
I wanted to do it again and again and
again and if they shouldn't do too much of

32
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:52,890
my laugh with me, I got to,
you know, grasp what's going
on here. Why am I feeling?

33
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,220
It's like, why? Why did this in
a weird way, like humbled you.

34
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,500
I don't think you should listen
to the people say you shouldn't,

35
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:00,990
you know too much. I think you
just do it as much as you want.

36
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,900
That's what I agree with too.
Yeah, I agree. You could handle it.

37
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,340
If you can handle being like Tyson, you
can handle doing DMT issues, EMT. Yeah,

38
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:11,190
that's what I think I'm going,
I'm going in that direction. Well,

39
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,230
I mean it's not something you
just do all day every day,

40
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:15,630
but you can learn a lot from it.
It's an and it's,

41
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,360
it's very beneficial and very
strange that it's illegal.

42
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,790
You know that it's illegal.
Yeah.

43
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:25,350
Notice that Mckenna had a joke about
it because your body is making it so

44
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:30,060
everybody's holding, we all
have it. You know, it's illegal,

45
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:32,730
but it's like making blooded legal.
Everybody has.

46
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:37,440
And then why would he go into scenario
data when he find these tolls? Yeah. Yeah.

47
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:41,790
I've never experienced it from the toad
of owning a television where the way

48
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:46,260
they extract and grab them and they
squeezed pimples and they busted on the

49
00:02:46,261 --> 00:02:49,960
class a marrow and then take it off
and he let it harden. Yeah, they,

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,170
they let it dry in the sun. They
scrape it off with a razor blade. Yeah.

51
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,460
I've only had it a synthetically
made in a laboratory.

52
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:01,390
You smelled a buy it online. Used to be
able to buy like a of fucking can of it.

53
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,860
Like this big enough to get like a whole
state high. She's just buy it online.

54
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:10,540
It was totally legal. Credible. Yeah.
It's weird design. It is illegal.

55
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,730
Well they would say not
for human consumption,

56
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,280
but I don't know what the fuck are you
doing with it if you're not using it for

57
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:17,710
human consumption but you,
you used to be able to buy.

58
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,990
I've never felt anything like that
before. No, nothing like that.

59
00:03:20,991 --> 00:03:23,980
Make me not want to do anything.
Nothing else can supersede that.

60
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,060
How long ago did it happen?
Around two months ago. Yeah.

61
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,790
Did you write down what happened after
it happened or did you record it? No,

62
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:36,390
I wish I did. Yeah, we should
that. Yeah, me too. If you like,

63
00:03:36,391 --> 00:03:40,540
it goes away like a dream, right? It comes
off. You know, you're, you're so scared.

64
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,690
You know stuff like this.

65
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,030
No, no, no. Ne,

66
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,240
Hey, I want this to stop now. And the
guy was like, hey, you're on the right.

67
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:56,990
And I'm like, no, no, no.
Yeah, I love it. I love you.

68
00:03:56,991 --> 00:03:58,190
I love you.
I love you.

69
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,540
Yeah. I'd love everybody.
Yeah. So spassed out. Yeah.

70
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,470
Did you have a hard time letting go?
And the beginning of fighting me,

71
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,420
I don't think stop wanting to stop now.
Just jump. Stop this shit now stopping.

72
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:15,350
The guy was like, hey, the show. I'm like,
I can do it. You got to go for the ride,

73
00:04:15,351 --> 00:04:19,370
dude. And it was like,
whoa man. Like I'm dying.

74
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,490
Things are going in my film theme,
the Aztec things. I'm being told,

75
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,210
I'm just seeing weird animal.
The thing is flying, it's just,

76
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,920
it's like another chamber. It's boom
flashing. Foom. He'd gone and take a walk.

77
00:04:30,921 --> 00:04:35,420
Are you taking off foom yeah.
It's beyond your imagination.

78
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:41,070
Yeah. DEF is inconceivable. Can't
even explain it to no one. Well,

79
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:43,680
I'm hoping that um,
the,

80
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,880
they start with psilocybin because a,
I know maps there.

81
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,530
They're doing some great work with that,

82
00:04:49,531 --> 00:04:53,100
trying to get these things legalize
especially they're doing MTMA studies with

83
00:04:53,101 --> 00:04:56,310
veterans and people with Ptsd
and they're having great results.

84
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,500
They're moving into civil side bend.

85
00:04:58,501 --> 00:05:00,900
They would love to get silicide
been legal and it's up for ballot.

86
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,300
I think it was in Oregon. Is
that where it is? It's up for,

87
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:07,140
I think Oregon is up for legalization
this year and it may be eventually in

88
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:11,070
California as well. They may do
addition, it should be legal.

89
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,120
It doesn't kill anybody. It should be,
it's not a bad thing if they regulate it,

90
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,870
if they make it for therapeutic use and
just set up centers where experts can

91
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:19,051
show,

92
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:22,110
but they shouldn't make it prohibitive
for people to own it or even grow their

93
00:05:22,111 --> 00:05:26,620
own. It's not a bad idea to set up
places where people can do it under a,

94
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,050
a professionals care, a showman's care.
Physicians Care, that's a good idea.

95
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,400
But making it illegal is a
bad idea because it helps
a lot of people, you know,

96
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:36,930
people think of it as a party drug.

97
00:05:36,931 --> 00:05:40,020
They think you're going to do mushrooms
and freak out and go fucking run around

98
00:05:40,021 --> 00:05:43,410
naked.
And He's do much as I love mushrooms,

99
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:49,110
will psilocybin and DMT or very
closely related chemically,

100
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,130
all those really potent psychedelic
drugs are very closely related.

101
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,790
They all break down in some
similar path inside your brain and,

102
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,370
and give you that,
that weird

103
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,280
ego dissolving experience.
You know, that's one thing.
